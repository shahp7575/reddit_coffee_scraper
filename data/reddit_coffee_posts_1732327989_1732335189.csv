Can you suggest a model that only requires me to push one button, that ideally also has a fairly large reservoir, and minimal other bells and whistles?

I don‚Äôt care if it takes longer in total time for the coffee to be ready - I want to push one button, walk away, and when I come back in 10 minutes the coffee is ready in my travel mug.

An auto-on in the morning is not a good solution because my work hours are super variable and I don‚Äôt want to set a new, different time every day (even if the interface is an app or something). I‚Äôd rather just tell it when I‚Äôm ready and have it heat up then brew on command.

‚Äúoh your letting me win?, Bullshit, you and i both know that we're way too competitive to just let the other person win at anything‚Äù

‚ÄúOK then, how about we play again and this time you don't hold back, winner gets to make the loser do 1 thing for them no questions asked‚Äú

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶are you gonna try saying that you weren't really trying again?, or are you finally going to admit that I'm just better than you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere you go, that wasn't so hard was it?‚Äù 

‚ÄúUgh your impossible sometimes you know that?, I swear in the 5 years of knowing you I have never met anyone more stubborn than  when it comes to admitting when they lose‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh ok maybe I could rival you sometimes but whether that's true or not I did beat you this time so you owe me 1 thing‚Äù.

‚ÄúI'm thinking, give me a second, jeez one second you don't want to make the bet and The next you want to get right into it‚Äù

‚ÄúAh I have the perfect thing, your gonna give me a massage session‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm pretty sure that the deal included a no questions asked part, so stop asking them And get to my reward‚Äù

‚ÄúNo not here, we can go into my room and do it on my bed, oh will you at least try to keep your mind out of the gutter?,  I clearly meant the spa session you perv‚Äù

‚ÄúMhmm you know you're actually better at that than I thought you would be‚Äù

‚ÄúOh don't get all offended now, I just meant that giving a good head massage was not something I thought you were capable of‚Äù

‚ÄúAh so that's where you've been vanishing to every Tuesday?, I never thought that you'd be the type of person to go to a class on spa treatments ,but I'm definitely not complaining about it‚Äù

(Scalp scratching stops)

(speaker gets more and more tired until the end of the script from this point)

‚ÄúMhh why did you?, oh right I said I wanted a back rub, ok yeah I'll just rollover and you can get to work, if I fall asleep you still need to finish, I expect at least another Half hour before your debt Is paid‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh yep That's right,  now that I know that you can do this so well, you're never gonna be allowed to not be pampering me when we're together‚Äù


‚Äúoh don't act like you didn't want me to say that, I guarantee the only reason that you took that course was so you could have an excuse to have me in exactly this position, isn't that right?‚Äù

‚Äúheh of course you deny it but I know the truth, tell you what if you tell the truth maybe‚Ä¶and only maybe I'll let you take me out for coffee sometime‚Äù

‚ÄúOoh I made you blush, heh I haven't made you do that in a while, not since your last birthday party and we played spin the bottle and you landed on me ‚Äù

‚Äúyes I know you have a crush on me, your like the least subtle person on the planet and I swear I'm here more than I'm at home‚Äô

‚Äúenough questions, I want my foot rub, if you do a good job maybe i'll even tell you if i have one on you or not‚Äù

‚Äúyes I mean it, now stop talking and rub them before i get impatient and find a different, less enjoyable way for you to pay your debt to me , my feet are so tired after the day I've had so a foot rub is sounding great to me,‚Äù

‚Äúbut keep my socks on, I'm too ticklish for you to rub them bare and if you tickle me i swear i will kick you, hard‚Äù

‚Äúof course I meant it,dumbass, I like you back, we've basically been dating for the last year‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're so clueless,why?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell because we only ever hang Out together, we almost never go out with other people and spend all of our free time, and sometimes not so Free time playing games or doing some other activity together, that's as close to dating as i have ever come so yes, we are dating‚Äù

‚Äúoh no no no, you have not earned a kiss yet, kisses are for boyfriends/girlfriends who don't tickle there partner while their eyes are closed‚Äù

‚Äúwell you should have thought about that before you decided to be funny, speaking of which guess who's feeling energised again?‚Äù

‚Äúyep it's me, I told you that you should have run away,  now c'mere you‚Äù

Nova! Let's get straight into it. These two moves are my favorite to teach new dancers.



I call this one, the Corpse Grinder. Non fighters call it the coffee grinder and theres some other variations we can use as well, like sweeps



Instead of getting two kicks off, ya use tha force of a full spin to bring them down to your level plus with the added pain of the full kick on their shin, not to mention the disrespect. But you'll have to use all your focus to get it off.



A nice ground game that no one can escape from unless they're a fellow dancer or a martial artist.



And this next one is great for when you gather lots of momentum



**Requirement:** *Have atleast 2 Move remaining*



Its called the Neck breaker, no need to give it a fancy new slang when it works both ways choom. You can aim high or low, the real monster behind this spin is the momentum.



Instead of getting two kicks off, use the momentum of a spin and use all your focus to inflict Broken Arm Critical Injury, and if you want to go for gold you can give your all (-8) and go for a Cracked Skull Critical Injury



Damn your flows are ill, choom. looks like ya got the basics down. Lets sum it up for the viewers at home! and if you survive the end of the month, come back to me and I'll teach ya some more.

Instead of making 2 Attacks with your Martial Arts Attack Action you can choose to make a Corpse Grinder Attack Action. Use your Martial Arts Special Move Resolution against a single target in range. If you hit, you deal damage to your target as if you had hit with a Martial Arts attack. Additionally, if you hit, your target is now Prone.

Instead of making 2 Attacks with your Martial Arts Attack Action you can choose to make Neck Breaker Attack Action. Use your Martial Arts Special Move Resolution against a single target in range. If you hit, inflict the Broken Arm Injury, and deal damage to your target as if you had hit with a Martial Arts Attack.

If you take a -8 to your check, you can instead use this special move to target your target's head location just like making an Aimed Shot, declare you are doing so when you roll. If you hit, inflict the Cracked Skull Injury. If they already had this Injury, they do no suffer another.

1gxqtvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Cosminion/comments/1gxqtvk/draft_the_marginal_product_of_labor_worker/,"Draft: The Marginal Product of Labor, Worker Cooperatives, and Theory/Practice","The purpose of this post is to address and clear up some of the posts and comments made on the subject of worker cooperatives (WCs) and conventional firms (CFs) when relevant. WCs are a kind of business that is collectively owned by its worker-members who each have a vote. In smaller firms, the hierarchy may be flat and direct democracy is applied. In larger firms, representative democracy may be used to streamline decision-making processes. Many WCs employ a mixture of direct and representative democratic structures. There are many ways to structure a WC, so it is important to remain attentive and consider nuance when discussing and passing overarching judgment on the model. This point will be elaborated further later on.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/HpnmfXkcDf) discusses how worker cooperatives would lead to high unemployment and that it would almost never make sense for these firms to hire additional workers. The marginal product of labor and the law of diminishing marginal productivity are mentioned as the economic basis for this claim. The idea is that when a firm hires workers, the marginal productivity increase will decrease per additional worker, *ceteris paribus*. At some point, the marginal productivity of an additional worker may reach a negative value and decrease overall productivity of the firm.

The table below displays a simplified example of a coffee shop that has access to three coffee makers.

|\# of Workers|Output|Marginal Product|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|5|
|2|10|5|
|3|15|5|
|4|17|2|
|5|18|1|
|6|17|\-1|

There may be a negative value in the marginal product due to overcrowding or an inefficient use of resources, making the idea of hiring more workers undesirable after a certain point.

>The marginal product of labor is usually a positive number during early hiring of workers, but does not usually show constant returns‚Äîthe MPL will always begin to slow as the number of laborers increases, and they, therefore, must begin sharing resources like equipment during the production process. Eventually, the MPL becomes negative, when hiring an additional worker would disrupt the company and cause a decrease in production. This is called¬†the law of diminishing marginal returns.[^(\[1\])](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/learn-about-marginal-product-of-labor-in-economics)

To be very clear, this economic concept applies to both cooperative and non-cooperative firms. A CF is constrained by the law of diminishing marginal returns just as a WC is.

It is incredibly important to note that the marginal product of labor may be measured only when the variable input is labor, and nothing else. If one were to add an additional worker as well as an additional coffee maker, then the measuring of the marginal product will not be accurate. This is what *ceteris paribus* means: all else being equal. This point is paramount in understanding because we know that non-labor factors can be variable, which would in effect change the level of the marginal product.

A WC, just like a CF, is capable of reinvesting into itself. In France, WCs reinvest significantly more of its surpluses than is legally required,^[[2]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPEO-10-2022-0025/full/html) and similar is found for firms in Italy.^[[3]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0885-3339(2011)0000012012/full/html). Very often, WCs explicitly set aside a portion of its profits in a reserve for reinvestment. These plans frequently include expanding the business by opening new locations or entering new markets, as well as improvements to capital such as purchasing additional machines or improving technologies. When a firm's increases its physical capital (tangible assets useful in production), its marginal product *increases* and the curve on the marginal product of labor graph shifts upwards.[^(\[4\])](https://www.hsto.info/iis-ru/bm600/dl/04_cost1_shortrun_b4.pdf) This means that the firm is now able to hire an amount of additional workers without resulting in a negative marginal product.

*Processing img dddkvii21q0e1...*

Now that we have clearly laid out the concepts of the marginal product of labor and the law of diminishing marginal returns, we can delve into empirical information and data. Notice how the referenced post/comment did not actually reference any data to support its claims. Theory is not very useful if reality contradicts it. The main idea put forth is that WCs will ""ALMOST NEVER"" hire additional workers due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. We have established that the marginal product curve can shift upwards when additional capital (land, machines, tools, etc) is introduced. Again, this applies to both WCs and CFs.

France boasts one of the most highly developed and comprehensive legal frameworks for WCs in the world.

>SCOPs (French WCs) are not capital starved. Indeed, there is no statistically significant difference between the distribution of capital intensity of SCOPs and conventional firms‚Äô. SCOPs do not operate at inefficiently small scales and are in fact larger than other French firms on average. Estrin and Jones (1998) find no evidence of under-investment in SCOPs. Fakhfakh et al. (2012) found that average annual investment in SCOPs was either significantly higher than in conventional firms or not significantly different in all industries.[^(\[5\])](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jpeo-10-2022-0025/full/html)

>Univariate comparisons show that worker cooperatives are not smaller than conventional firms in all industries and are observed to expand their capital at least as fast as conventional firms.[^(\[6\])](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281599834_Productivity_Capital_and_Labor_in_Labor-Managed_and_Conventional_Firms)

SCOPs have the ability to expand its capital and hire more workers due to sufficient investment levels that are comparable to or even exceed that of CFs. Their being larger than CFs is a reflection of this fact. If the claim that WCs would ""ALMOST NEVER"" hire additional workers were true, why are French WCs larger? This trend is reflected in other countries: Spain and Uruguay WCs are larger than their respective CFs.[^(\[7\])](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf) Italian WCs are larger than CFs, and this is influenced by the goal of WCs to protect and generate quality employment. WCs exhibit a greater tendency to invest in social capital.[^(\[8\])](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371950257_Worker_cooperatives_in_Italy_legislation_prevalence_and_recent_trends) It is crucial to acknowledge that WCs are not necessarily solely profit-driven enterprises. Many are created to address the need for employment and income, and this is especially true during economic downturns.

*Processing img u2fpmba9vq0e1...*

A study of French and Spanish WCs measured their resilience during the 2008 financial crisis, finding that they tended to match or exceed survival and employment resiliency of CFs and that they also tended to recover more quickly.[^(\[9\])](https://www.ess-europe.eu/sites/default/files/report_cecop_2012_en_web.pdf) In 2008, French WCs saw a 4.2% increase in its workforce while CFs saw a 0.7% decline. In Spain, the number of WCs decreased by 2.5% while the number for CFs decreased by nearly 15%.[^(\[10\])](https://ess-europe.eu/sites/default/files/publications/files/eurofound_-_cooperatives_and_social_enterprises.pdf) These data points further corroborate the fact that WCs tend to be better for the employment level.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/AGItFrPL1f) encapsulates the assumptions and therefore the level of ignorance required to arrive at the conclusion that WCs will tend to not hire new workers.

>If you must distribute ownership of a company equally among workers, it will ALMOST NEVER make sense to hire another worker. This is because any additional profit they can bring in is diluted by the share of ownership that other workers give up.

The assumption here is that WCs distribute ownership equally among workers. Reality is more nuanced. Many WCs employ a system of internal capital accounts that represent the individual equity ownership of each worker.^[[11]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://icagroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Internal-Capital-Accounts.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjpxcT7sdqJAxUAEFkFHTLQG4EQFnoECAYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2Nz4uKfsOskcZHZiWHWCim) Washington State and New York are two U.S. states that have mentioned ICAs in their business laws.[^(\[12\])](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=23.78.090)^[[13]](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/cco/article-5-a/92/) The value of each capital account can be different. Someone who has worked at a cooperative for ten years may have an ICA that reflects greater value from earned bonuses and patronage over those years, while a worker who has just started out may have an ICA worth a lesser amount.

The other assumption here is that shares of ownership must be diluted to accommodate new workers, which is entirely inaccurate under the ICA model. Here is an example: John has an ICA worth $10,000, Kara has one worth $5,000, and Wilson has one worth $1,000. They decide to hire a new worker named Carl and grant them membership. Carl pays the $250 fee to open their ICA with the co-op, and so his ICA is now valued at $250. Over time, Carl's ICA value will rise as he earns profit sharing bonuses. At no point did the ICAs of any other worker have to be redistributed to accommodate Carl's entrance as a member. John, Kara, and Wilson continued to increase their own ICAs over time without having to transfer a cent towards Carl's account. Under the internal capital accounts system, existing workers do not have to dilute their equity ownership shares when admitting new members.

>If a company of 100 has a profit margin of $10k per employee, a new employee may bring in a profit of $9,500 (due to the [Law of Diminishing Marginal Productivity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-diminishing-marginal-productivity.asp)). This would reduce the *per worker profit margin* to $9,995. Why would a company ever hire this additional worker???

As noted previously, the law of diminishing marginal productivity applies to both WCs and CFs, and firms that invest in capital such as land, machines, and/or tools would shift the marginal product curve upwards, allowing for additional workers to be hired without resulting in negative marginal values. WCs are capable of investment to increase capital, and this is evident in the sources provided earlier. There is little or no empirical evidence to support the claim that the law of diminishing marginal productivity presents a greater growth constraint for WCs than it does for CFs.

Additional assumptions that are made by the content include: assuming every worker becomes a member as soon as they are hired (and therefore included in profit sharing immediately), assuming every worker receives the same compensation, and assuming workers will always choose to pursue maximizing income per worker. These are actually theories originally postulated in The Firm in Illyria by Benjamin Ward.^[[14]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808268) Subsequent empirical research has since emerged that contradict these theories. One study on plywood co-ops found that they place more weight on employment than earnings.^[[15]](https://doi.org/10.1006/jcec.1993.1027)

The WDV (Ward-Domar-Vanek) framework states that LMFs maximise income per worker, which assumes workers' are significantly self interested, with a lack of consideration for what is logical for the survival and success of the firm, as pursuing maximum income per worker may infringe on future success if less workers are hired in order to increase productivity and overall profit margin. Similar frameworks also assume workers will choose to enrich themselves short term, as well as shirk and freeride, ultimately leading to the closure of the firm, assuming a lack of long term reasoning from workers. This would theoretically lead to underinvestment as surplus is disproportionately distributed rather than reinvested. A glaring issue with the WDV framework to consider is that it assumes each worker receives equal patronage, which is not the case for many LMFs that distribute proportionately based on labored hours or other factors.

The ""backward supply response"" is also a theoretical model which states that a LMF's output would decrease as demand increases, as well as assume that workers may be fired in these situations. This, again, assumes workers do not employ long term rationale, instead hyperfocusing on short term income gain on a personal level. This dismisses the fact that LMFs typically adjust wages rather than employment when necessary, as employment is high in importance for workers.^([[1]](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf))

These frameworks have been found incomplete/inaccurate as more empirical literature on the model has been published and examined. In France, LMFs reinvests significantly more of its surpluses than is legally required,^([[2]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPEO-10-2022-0025/full/html)) and similar is found for firms in Italy.^([[3]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0885-3339(2011)0000012012/full/html)) There is little evidence of the backward supply response, and LMFs in general have significantly greater employment stability^([[4]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/apce.12124)) and resilience to recessions.^([[5]](https://www.ess-europe.eu/sites/default/files/report_cecop_2012_en_web.pdf)) They survive longer than conventional firms,^([[6]](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/1811/71538/1/OSLJ_V73N2_0219.pdf)) lending support to the fact that workers do consider long term goals and consider not only today's personal gain, but the sustainability of the firm for the future. Shirking is found to be low and mitigatable as workers are incentivised to self-monitor.^([[7]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979399204600108?journalCode=ilra)[[8]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213297X21000082)) LMFs are actually comparably larger than conventional businesses, which is relevant to the theories that assume these firms will not hire at the same rate as other businesses.^([[9]](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf)[[10]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371950257_Worker_cooperatives_in_Italy_legislation_prevalence_and_recent_trends))

Note that there are mentions of Yugoslav ""LMFs"" in support of the theory of inherent inefficiency. This is problematic considering the unique circumstances surrounding these firms, and I have listed sources about this in a previous comment.^([[11]](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/6w4fXkLxOv)) Essentially, drawing parallels between modern day LMFs and Yugoslavia's firms and assuming they're comparable would be fallacious and misled.",1,1732334137.0,u_Cosminion,0,1.0,False

How do I bring this up with her?,"The girl (21F) I‚Äôm (23M) seeing is still in touch with her ex that wants her. How do I bring this up with her?

This girl I‚Äôve been dating for a couple of months now is still in touch with her ex. But she doesn‚Äôt refer to him as an ‚Äúex‚Äù because they were in an fwb where he said he wants more, she developed feelings and he didn‚Äôt reciprocate that fully. Hence a situationship. I met her 3 months after this ended.

Now I‚Äôm the kind of person that doesn‚Äôt have any contact with my exes or people who I‚Äôve been physically/emotionally involved with when I‚Äôm with someone new, but I understand that‚Äôs not possible for everyone especially if they share the same friend group. But that isn‚Äôt the case with her and this guy. They are from the same university but don‚Äôt see each other as they‚Äôre in different courses. 

I didn‚Äôt make much of it initially because we were still getting to know each other but one day when we were on a date this guy called her. I realised they were still in contact when she told me that they send random texts here and there and send reels to each other. She didn‚Äôt pick up the call and later told me that he wanted to get coffee with her. She denied it and I thought that would be that but they‚Äôre still in touch. I do not know the contents of their conversation.

She asked me if it made me uncomfortable and I said I don‚Äôt want her to specifically do something just for me (in hindsight I should‚Äôve just said yes). She said she knows that I‚Äôm not the kind of person who‚Äôd keep in touch with an ex and wants to know my opinion, to which I said, if she knows I‚Äôm that kind of person, then that‚Äôs my opinion and she said alright.

It‚Äôs been bugging me now more than ever since I‚Äôm developing strong feelings for her and want to know if we‚Äôre on the same page but don‚Äôt want to come across as jealous or controlling. We had a conversation about what we‚Äôre doing and she said she really likes me and wants to keep dating me. 

She‚Äôs in touch with another ex too but that doesn‚Äôt bother me as much because she lost feelings for that person and now it‚Äôs just academic related talk. 


How do I bring this issue up? Am I being insecure?

Today I asked the man to grind for espresso.
But when I tried to pull and espresso shot my machine choked. Now I confirmed with the person that it was espresso grind.
So I think the problem is with the pressurized portafilter basket. 
If I change to a non pressurized bottomless basket will the issue be solved, or is it the problem with the machine??",1,1732332921.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

‚Äúhaha I won, that's the 3rd match in a row that I've beaten you, are you even paying attention to the game or have you just forgotten how to use the block button altogether?‚Äù

‚Äúoh your letting me win?, Bullshit, you and i both know that we're way too competitive to just let the other person win at anything‚Äù

‚ÄúOK then, how about we play again and this time you don't hold back, winner gets to make the loser do 1 thing for them no questions asked‚Äú


‚Äúwhat's wrong?, I thought you were letting me win?, if you were then you could just play for real right?...unless you were lying?‚Äù

‚Äúgreat, then let's get started, the quicker you lose and I get my reward‚Äù

(Pause)

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶are you gonna try saying that you weren't really trying again?, or are you finally going to admit that I'm just better than you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere you go, that wasn't so hard was it?‚Äù 

‚ÄúUgh your impossible sometimes you know that?, I swear in the 5 years of knowing you I have never met anyone more stubborn than  when it comes to admitting when they lose‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh ok maybe I could rival you sometimes but whether that's true or not I did beat you this time so you owe me 1 thing‚Äù.

‚ÄúI'm thinking, give me a second, jeez one second you don't want to make the bet and The next you want to get right into it‚Äù

‚ÄúAh I have the perfect thing, your gonna give me a massage session‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean exactly what I said, I want a Scalp massage,back and shoulder rub as well as a foot rub‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm pretty sure that the deal included a no questions asked part, so stop asking them And get to my reward‚Äù

‚ÄúNo not here, we can go into my room and do it on my bed, oh will you at least try to keep your mind out of the gutter?,  I clearly meant the spa session you perv‚Äù

‚Äúlike you could pull a guy/girl like me anyway, someone's a little overconfident, I mean how do you expect to get a partner as awesome as me when you can't even beat them at games‚Äù

(Pause)

(Scalp scratching noises throughout section)

‚ÄúMhmm you know you're actually better at that than I thought you would be‚Äù

‚ÄúOh don't get all offended now, I just meant that giving a good head massage was not something I thought you were capable of‚Äù

‚ÄúAh so that's where you've been vanishing to every Tuesday?, I never thought that you'd be the type of person to go to a class on spa treatments ,but I'm definitely not complaining about it‚Äù

(Scalp scratching stops)

(speaker gets more and more tired until the end of the script from this point)

‚ÄúMhh why did you?, oh right I said I wanted a back rub, ok yeah I'll just rollover and you can get to work, if I fall asleep you still need to finish, I expect at least another Half hour before your debt Is paid‚Äù

(Fabric noises)

‚ÄúOh that's really Good, oh you're definitely not allowed to stop taking that course, you're going to be doing this every time we hang out  from Now on, well if you aren't happy about it you shouldn't have been so good at this‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh yep That's right,  now that I know that you can do this so well, you're never gonna be allowed to not be pampering me when we're together‚Äù


‚Äúoh don't act like you didn't want me to say that, I guarantee the only reason that you took that course was so you could have an excuse to have me in exactly this position, isn't that right?‚Äù

‚Äúheh of course you deny it but I know the truth, tell you what if you tell the truth maybe‚Ä¶and only maybe I'll let you take me out for coffee sometime‚Äù

‚ÄúOoh I made you blush, heh I haven't made you do that in a while, not since your last birthday party and we played spin the bottle and you landed on me ‚Äù

‚Äúyes I know you have a crush on me, your like the least subtle person on the planet and I swear I'm here more than I'm at home‚Äô

‚Äúenough questions, I want my foot rub, if you do a good job maybe i'll even tell you if i have one on you or not‚Äù

‚Äúyes I mean it, now stop talking and rub them before i get impatient and find a different, less enjoyable way for you to pay your debt to me , my feet are so tired after the day I've had so a foot rub is sounding great to me,‚Äù

‚Äúbut keep my socks on, I'm too ticklish for you to rub them bare and if you tickle me i swear i will kick you, hard‚Äù

(Fabric/sock rubbing or scratching noises )

‚Äúmmm oh wow, that's close to being the best feeling of the night mmm‚Äù

‚Äúyawn, no I'm not tired I'm just a little worn out is all, yeah i'll be fine just keep going while I rest my eyes‚Äù

(Giggling)

[Section is Spoken through giggles]:

 I swear if you don't stop I will kick you, this isn't funny I said a foot rub not a foot tickle‚Äù

‚Äúwhat?, seriously this is what you're doing to get me to answer?, you'll have to do better than this to get me to talk dumbass‚Äù

(Laughter )

[Section Spoken through laughter]

‚Äúeep not my toes, you're so getting your ass kicked for this‚Äù

‚Äúok ok I do, I have a crush on you as well now stop you fuck‚Äù

(Laughter stops)

‚ÄúUgh, you are an absolute fucker ‚Ä¶ ok fine ‚Ä¶maybe that was pretty funny and I guess giving you access to my feet was kinda asking for it but I swear as soon as I have the energy,  I will get you back for it so you'd better run, and run far‚Äù

‚Äúof course I meant it,dumbass, I like you back, we've basically been dating for the last year‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're so clueless,why?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell because we only ever hang Out together, we almost never go out with other people and spend all of our free time, and sometimes not so Free time playing games or doing some other activity together, that's as close to dating as i have ever come so yes, we are dating‚Äù

‚Äúoh no no no, you have not earned a kiss yet, kisses are for boyfriends/girlfriends who don't tickle there partner while their eyes are closed‚Äù

‚Äúwell you should have thought about that before you decided to be funny, speaking of which guess who's feeling energised again?‚Äù

‚Äúyep it's me, I told you that you should have run away,  now c'mere you‚Äù

(Wrestling and giggling sounds)

‚ÄúAhh, hey throwing me is no fair I'm like half your size‚Äù

(Running and voices going distant before fading out to nothing )

‚ÄúHey come back here this is your house where are you gonna run to? ‚Äú

‚ÄúOoh so that's where you're gonna try to hide‚Ä¶well that just means I can do this and you can't get away‚Äù

I work a hybrid sales job, and was WFH today. We use an application that tracks our cold calls and emails sent, so everyone in the organization could see what we are doing on activity dashboards. Today, we had a special cold calling block on our calendars dedicated to just making calls to increase our outreach towards the holiday season. This block was particularly early in the work day, and it was set to begin right after a team meeting. Naturally, one might use the restroom or make coffee or eat breakfast to get energy in preparation for the workday ahead. 

Not my manager! I was having a rough morning already as I woke up later than I wanted, and had to feed my pets so I didn't have time to eat breakfast before the meeting. After the team meeting, I went to make some toast and eggs. Took me 20 minutes to cook and eat. I log on and start making calls when I see that my manager sent me a lovely message. ""Hey, I noticed you haven't made any calls yet. Are you okay? Is there any issues?"" (a seemingly caring sounding version of ""why havent you made any calls?"" 

Mind you IT IS 20 MINUTES IN to a multiple hour block. I'm already triggered at that. I reply ""No issues, I was just eating something. I'm making calls now"". We're all adults, and this job is very chill as it is. Surely she will understand. She replied ""Ok, I'm gonna need you to amp up your efforts. We've had this event planned out for a week. My expectation is that everyone was prepared to start calling as soon as the block began."" 

Why did she say that? Implying I'm slacking because I had to eat? I could have made 20 calls, gone to eat and came back and you wouldn't know. If I hadn't had any activity maybe 45 minutes or an hour in, sure, call me out. She clearly had nothing better to do if she's micromanaging me this early in the day. How bout you make some calls? What if I had diabetes or something and I pass out if I don't eat? Matter of fact, aren't people MORE productive after fueling themselves with food for the work day? But sure, I'll drop my food since making cold calls and soliciting innocent people at 9am is going to be SO productive. While I'm at it, let me hold my shit in until noon when the event is over so I'm not being a slacker in the bathroom. 

Needless to say, I was a top performer in the event. I was never not going to be. It's not like we couldnt make calls to prospects outside of the event time. It's not like I was gonna just not do my job. I get paid well after all. Be so for real. Hope she didnt think I performed well because she was on my ass about it. I did it on my own, because I'm good at what I do without being told to do it. Didnt know I was a child. Now I just want to avoid her but given she's my manager, its gonna be hard. And I'll be darned if I quit- nobody is pushing me out of my position by making my work life hard. ",1,1732332794.0,venting,1,1.0,False
1gxqfc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/1gxqfc3/can_tulpas_affect_my_caffeine_tolerance/,Can tulpas affect my caffeine tolerance?,"For a little background, the ability for caffeine to make me crash is on a hair-trigger. Less than is in a regular cup of coffee, or even half of one. I don't mean that I have ADHD, and caffeine has the opposite effect; I mean it will wake me up until I have just a little too much. I believe that this is because of years of drinking too much coffee having a negative effect on my tolerance. But that's another story.

Point is: these days, I'm used to a cup of black tea in the morning being enough to get me through the day. However, these past two days, since I've started forcing, that same amount has had a noticeably lesser effect. I need caffeine more often throughout the day to stay awake, and in amounts far above what would normally make me crash (a regular amount for most people, to be clear). 

I know it's a little correlation-over-causation, but this literally started *the day* after I began forcing. Could there be a connection, or is it more likely something else?",5,1732332783.0,Tulpas,3,1.0,False

We have downtime, sometimes, where we‚Äôre waiting for the phone to ring.  

My coworker (52f) has some issues in her life that she *expects* to be supported in.  And on the surface that‚Äôs fine.  We are a supportive workplace to each other.  We talk about family crises, give each other rides when our cars are in the shop, and sometimes we even ask each other for parenting advice.

The problem is that I (39f) really don‚Äôt want to *fully* take her side in her family issues.  I think she‚Äôs rigid, uncompromising and a definite part of the problem.  

Normally I can say something slightly sympathetic and try to just hear the rest (I feel like saying I listen is sometimes an exaggeration, although I do listen sometimes).  We are tied to our desks because our phones might ring.

Sometimes, though, listening gets painful.  Like when she criticizes her daughter (20f) to us multiple times a day AND THEN tells everyone else that their daughters will cause them trouble and exasperation as they grow up because they‚Äôre girls and girls, but not boys, are like that.  Or when she is proud that she organized a family confrontation of her grandchild‚Äôs mother where the mother was demanded (at risk of a custody battle) to sit and listen to the whole family‚Äôs criticisms of her ‚Äî then the issue raised was that she brought an iced coffee she bought with her own money.  Or insists that the same mother has ‚Äúzero brain activity‚Äù because she had dinner out.  (TMI, but whenever my coworker doesn‚Äôt want to cook, her son buys her dinner, and she never questions her own brain activity.)

Today, though, she was upset about a conflict where I could see both sides, and started whispering to our other nearby coworker, expecting her to completely take her side.  She already knows I don‚Äôt just do that unequivocally.  It sounded like a normal in-law conflict that I just . . . don‚Äôt want to be asked to take a side on, especially at work.  The last straw was that the second coworker, who is a little more supportive than I am, asked me to go decorate the Christmas tree. 

I think it was so they could talk without me.  
I still had to listen for my phone.  I don‚Äôt mind decorating the Christmas tree, and we were going to decorate it today anyway, but at that moment I felt unwelcome at my own cubicle.  

WIBTA for raising the conflict with management?  The reason I haven‚Äôt asked to move is that there‚Äôs an oversharer on the other end of the cubicles too.  I feel that the behavior is inappropriate, but we do try to be supportive to each other within reason.  I feel like if I try to raise my discomfort, I will make everyone, including the supervisors, feel uncomfortable for being friendly and small-town-ish.  I don‚Äôt want to do that.  It‚Äôs nice to have someone offer a care package when there‚Äôs a surgery or ask how my family is doing (but not tell me what they should be doing, which this coworker does).  I‚Äôm not sure I can professionally describe where I draw the line.  I don‚Äôt often express my evaluations of my coworker‚Äôs situations to her, but I don‚Äôt vocally agree with her either, and that‚Äôs what she wants.  WIBTA?",1,1732332674.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

Here‚Äôs what I have so far. In the morning, we‚Äôll start with a quiet walk along Canal Saint-Martin,  grab some coffee and/or breakfast and enjoy each others company. From there, we‚Äôll explore La Petite Ceinture, but I know that it has opening times so I'm not really sure how that would work

For lunch, I‚Äôve reserved a table at Le Tout Paris at 14:30.  Afterward, we‚Äôll spend the afternoon exploring the city more. 

We‚Äôll take a break in the early evening (around 17:00) to freshen up and get ready for dinner. At 19:30, I‚Äôll pick her up for dinner at Shang Palace at the Shangri-La Paris,

After dinner, I planned for us to take a short romantic walk along Pont Bir-Hakeim on our way back to the car.  I think it will be a lovely way to end the evening before I drive her home.

I‚Äôd really appreciate everyones thoughts on this itinerary. Does the timing seem reasonable, or does it feel too packed? Are there any places I should consider adding or replacing?

I used ALL of my expensive creams today in contempt of my sadness, and in spite of my tears. I am not crying anymore today. I am going to do my damnedest to refuse this looming resurgence of darkness. 

The sun is still shining and while I may not be thriving, fuck, I'm still alive. Are there days that I don't want to be? Absolutely, I will never lie about that. But there are also days where the push back and determination to remain unmoved are somehow enough. 

I woke up so sad and I cried almost immediately, so I put on some sad songs and let my tears flow freely during my shower. There's nothing special about today, I just woke up this way. Funnily enough, it was something in the warmth and richness of my morning coffee that put some brightness in my day and helped push away a little bit of the shadow lingering around my heart. 

It really is the little things, y‚Äôknow? Life is full of them. Little flowers and little daggers everywhere ‚Ä¶ I look back and think of how many times I believed myself to be running wild and free through a field of wildflowers only to realize that I was actually surrounded by flames. And I wasn't free at all, I was trapped. 

But not now ‚Ä¶ now I am free, nothing and no one holding me, nothing and no one wanting me. Truly ‚Ä¶ free ‚Ä¶ 

There are no wildflowers, though, not in this field that I find myself in. It's just shadows and swirling darkness. I'm alone here, too, but this place is familiar ‚Ä¶ I won't find happiness here, it can't exist here, nothing can, not even sadness. This place is just dark and empty. And that's why I like it here, because being in a place where I feel nothing also means being in a place where nothing hurts. 

It's a kind of peace, albeit not the peace I want, not the peace I'm looking for and working towards. I want the peace that comes out of love, not defeat. I want to love you so badly ‚Ä¶ but you won't let me. And it doesn't matter why, whether your reasons are truth or lies, all that matters is the love that you deny. There are times that I still feel yours, and it's the most amazing feeling, it's unlike anything I've ever felt before ‚Ä¶ and you have no idea how bad it hurts me and how low I fall when you take it away. 

Trying to stay strong in the face of all of this asks for a kind of brave that I'm not sure I am, and a kind of strength I don't think I have anymore ‚Ä¶ maybe I never did. I don't know what to do, because all I want is you. And I love you, in a way that I have never experienced love, the purest and most honest love that I have ever felt ‚Ä¶ and you don't even want it ‚Ä¶ 

I don't know how to make it stop. I keep feeling you and seeing signs but nothing makes sense because you keep going away. And I don't just mean the distance between us or your silence, it's something else entirely ... 

I'm taking the rest of the day off ‚Ä¶ I can't focus or concentrate on work, days like today the heaviness in my head and heart are just too much. Today's challenge will be simply sitting by the river, without wanting to drown myself in it. 

But I won't cry anymore today. The darkness can swirl and I'll stand in defiance of it. My light may be greatly diminished, it still flickers with a love that cannot be extinguished. Love is my only purpose, love is all there is. A good love, and a good heart ‚Ä¶ those are things to live for. And while I haven't experienced much return, I've still got a bit to share. 

If you ever change your mind ‚Ä¶ come find me.

Maybe have been there 3x in my life, even though island born and raised. But it‚Äôs cute, lots of foot traffic, feels vibrant. Yes it is small and there are the same social issues every town/city faces but downtown Duncan has the feeling that people want to go and spend time there. Visit some shops, have a coffee or drink, walk around. 

It is right beside the heavy traffic island highway, it is not on the ocean, and strip mall is directly south. Not ideal, but I still think it has charm. 

Nanaimo has a downtown on the steps of the salish sea, with beautiful scenery (benson to the left and ocean to the right), nice waterfront walk and park, good city-to-city-transportation ( H.air,S.air,BCFS,Hullo,HeliJet), ferries to three cool islands, yet our downtown does not have the same charm, vibe, or pedestrian traffic downtown duncan has.

There is no reason Nanaimo can‚Äôt be second to Victoria. Why is our downtown not thriving? And don‚Äôt blame the strip malls in north nanaimo. Victoria has uptown, hillside, tillicum, but the downtown draws tourists from all over the world. 

Obviously there are 1000 factors to everything in a subject like this but the fact is, Nanaimo has good people and downtown Nanaimo is in geographical beautiful place and I want to see it thrive.

We live in the same apartment building but not in the same house. It's a great arrangement overall. 

The issue is i still live my life like a single parent because my partner is minimally involved in the runnings of my house. So naturally I'm overworked a lot and have very little energy by the end of the day. My partner takes naps during the day, is able to prioritise their fitness and has very few friends. I do my best to manage everything - kids, work, relaxation, time with partner - but they still feel i do not prioritise them. They say I'm always doing something or the other, or preoccupied or distracted etc. They say they want my hundred percent presence and they feel they've been asking this for a long time but they aren't getting it from me. 

Except that this week, i skipped work and took them out for a coffee because they were troubled. I took an afternoon off and spent it at their place till dinner time and we talked and watched a movie. I message them through the day, look forward to little rituals we have, involve them in all plans i might make.

Just got home from a vacation to Gatlinburg, TN, so got a chance to drive a lot on mountain roads with plenty of hairpins. 

- Handling is excellent. I cannot say enough about how it hugs curves and rolls through corners with little to no stability issues. Even in heavy wind, you get the push but it stays fairly well centered. I rented a 2024 Acadia recently and drove it in 30 mph steady wind w/ higher gusts and you felt the push and had to work to keep it centered. XT6 has much less play.

- 5 hours up to Gatlinburg from Atlanta and the ride was very comfortable. My wife has an autoimmune disorder and arthritis in her knees. It was only on the ride back that she started to wear down and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù being in the car. 

- The acceleration is a mystery. I keep it in touring mode and it feels like sometimes it‚Äôs on point and ready to go, but every once in a while it doesn‚Äôt engage like you might expect. Punch it, however, and you‚Äôll be doing 95 before you know it.

- Two full size suitcases, two backpacks, two trays of kitchen stuff, a couple flats of water, and a couple other things fit in the back, third row of seats folded down, without issue. Had to do some Tetris with the big suitcases, but it‚Äôs not an Escalade. I‚Äôll take it.

- Gas mileage. I could‚Äôve done the entire trip, one way, on one tank with miles to play with. We only stopped on the way back for bathroom and coffee. Beyond pleased with that.

- Navigation and infotainment: I had a Sierra Denali and I despised the Google infotainment, buggy as hell. The XT6 has the old GM nav and it‚Äôs excellent. A little weird at times on re-routing, taking forever to stop the ‚Äòu-turn‚Äô cycle, but I‚Äôll take it. 

Bottom line, for my $70K I am very happy. At least an 8/10 and potentially a 9. If I trade out, it‚Äôll only be for more cargo room like a Yukon or Escalade.",2,1732330968.0,Cadillac,2,1.0,False
1gxpuui,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1gxpuui/struggling_with_histamine_intolerance_am_i_really/,Struggling with Histamine Intolerance: Am I Really Improving?,"Hi everyone! üëã I‚Äôve been on a very strict nutrition plan for the past 211 days, supervised by my endocrinologist. My diet eliminates gluten, grains, legumes, high-histamine fruits, processed foods, sugars, starches, as well as coffee, tea, and alcohol. I‚Äôm also restricted to eating only lamb as my sole source of meat. This approach was designed to address a myriad of long-standing health issues, including over 10 years of asthma, chronic migraines, and allergic rhinitis. While it‚Äôs been a challenging journey, I‚Äôm fully committed and definitely seeing the benefits.

Over this time, I‚Äôve lost around 33 pounds (15 kg) and the dreaded steroid moon face I had been struggling with. I thought I had improved a lot and hadn‚Äôt experienced any histamine-related problems for the past month. With the confidence of getting into great shape (I‚Äôve been weight training three times a week) and loving how my skin looks, I‚Äôve been enjoying getting dolled up for social gatherings and even for work.

Since I hadn‚Äôt been dealing with asthma-related issues, I thought it would be okay to use hair sprays and dry shampoo, which I previously avoided. Unfortunately, this led to the worst case of contact dermatitis I‚Äôve ever experienced‚Äîstarting on my scalp and progressively spreading hives across my entire body. I tried to manage it without corticosteroids and relied on antihistamines, but they didn‚Äôt work. Ten days after the initial reaction, I woke up this morning feeling my throat closing and rushed to my doctor. I was scolded for not coming sooner and had to receive a corticosteroid shot immediately.

I now feel like I‚Äôm back to square one, being a slave to corticosteroids and antihistamines, and my skin feels like a pool of histamines‚Äîeven the slightest touch is giving me hives. I thought I had improved so much, but it turns out my condition is still the same, and this realization has left me feeling incredibly distressed.

Do any of you find yourselves facing something completely out of the ordinary while trying to manage histamine intolerance? Do we really have a chance of improving in the long term? I was so confident that I could make progress and truly improve my condition, but now I‚Äôm questioning whether I‚Äôm just avoiding triggers for temporary relief.",1,1732330892.0,HistamineIntolerance,1,1.0,False

How do I bring this up with her?,"This girl I‚Äôve been dating for a couple of months now is still in touch with her ex. But she doesn‚Äôt refer to him as an ‚Äúex‚Äù because they were in an fwb where he said he wants more, she developed feelings and he didn‚Äôt reciprocate that fully. Hence a situationship. I met her 3 months after this ended.

Now I‚Äôm the kind of person that doesn‚Äôt have any contact with my exes or people who I‚Äôve been physically/emotionally involved with when I‚Äôm with someone new, but I understand that‚Äôs not possible for everyone especially if they share the same friend group. But that isn‚Äôt the case with her and this guy. They are from the same university but don‚Äôt see each other as they‚Äôre in different courses. 

I didn‚Äôt make much of it initially because we were still getting to know each other but one day when we were on a date this guy called her. I realised they were still in contact when she told me that they send random texts here and there and send reels to each other. She didn‚Äôt pick up the call and later told me that he wanted to get coffee with her. She denied it and I thought that would be that but they‚Äôre still in touch. I do not know the contents of their conversation.

She asked me if it made me uncomfortable and I said I don‚Äôt want her to specifically do something just for me (in hindsight I should‚Äôve just said yes). She said she knows that I‚Äôm not the kind of person who‚Äôd keep in touch with an ex and wants to know my opinion, to which I said, if she knows I‚Äôm that kind of person, then that‚Äôs my opinion and she said alright.

It‚Äôs been bugging me now more than ever since I‚Äôm developing strong feelings for her and want to know if we‚Äôre on the same page but don‚Äôt want to come across as jealous or controlling. We had a conversation about what we‚Äôre doing and she said she really likes me and wants to keep dating me. 

She‚Äôs in touch with another ex too but that doesn‚Äôt bother me as much because she lost feelings for that person and now it‚Äôs just academic related talk. 


How do I bring this issue up? Am I being insecure? 

Tl:dr - girl still in touch with an ex who wants her, she asked me how I feel and I believe i conveyed myself but should‚Äôve been more clear about how I feel. Now she‚Äôs still in touch and I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up.

The beginning of the relationship was great and i was so happy. I honestly had no complaints and was so excited to be with him. I honestly really enjoy my time with him and love so much about him. I really want to make him happy and i do my best to always put a smile on his face. We live about 40 min from each other, but he works about 15 min from where i live. Since we‚Äôve been dating we‚Äôve tried to see each other once a week, whether him coming to my house or vice versa either for one or two days. We talk throughout the day, send snaps, and used to facetime almost every night. 

Recently he‚Äôs become really distant due to personal things in his life. One of them being a huge set back in his career that he will be dedicating a lot of his personal time(which will be the next few months) to do what he needs to do to take the next step. I knew what to expect from the set back and i have told him numerous times that i am here to support him in any way he needs, as well as give him his space. Another being a close family member has been in the hospital for the past week and they don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on. Both of these are very stressful and overwhelming for him and i really don‚Äôt want to add more to his plate.

The last time we spent a night was two weeks ago. This was right before everything happened. After that, i saw him for about 20 mins for coffee a week and a half ago, and haven‚Äôt seen him in person since. These past few weeks have been rough for me dealing with my own anxiety over the relationship and how it will end up. When we spoke last week in person we acknowledged that we don‚Äôt want any feelings of resentment, neglect or just any unhappiness. So we will just see how it goes.

I really don‚Äôt  want to ask to see him, because i want to leave everything on his terms, considering how he‚Äôs using his personal time and i don‚Äôt want to make him feel bad. But i also want him to ask cause i want to feel like he wants to see me. I gave in though and asked him this past Sunday if i can see him this week. What i meant was to spend a night together, but he responded with ‚Äúwe can get coffee‚Äù (getting coffee is something we‚Äôd meet each other before work once a week or every other week, which we haven‚Äôt done in a month or so). l take it because i still wanna see him. Still no mention of planning to see me so far, and i know for a fact i won‚Äôt see him on the weekend. I was even by his work the two days ago at our coffee shop. I didn‚Äôt ask to see him, but i was kinda hoping maybe he could stop by and at least say hi, but nothing. 

He‚Äôs basically grieving and i understand grief as i have gone through it in my own unfortunate ways. Completely different but i understand isolating  and being more distant. I don‚Äôt know though, he still talks to me throughout the day, still calls me on facetime a couple times a week, sends pictures. He doesn‚Äôt really react to the pictures i send him like he used to though. I do feel a difference though in how he talks to me from before. I feel like he just doesn‚Äôt care how i‚Äôm doing, how i‚Äôm feeling. 

At this point i don‚Äôt know how to feel. I know it‚Äôs been a short amount of time since all of this happened, but it just kinda hurts me feeling like he doesn‚Äôt care and not knowing when i‚Äôll be able to see him. I really do appreciate the time he gives me through the phone, but i honestly would just like even just a little physical time as well. 

I feel selfish, i feel guilty, i feel scared, i feel annoying. I am trying my best to keep a smile on my face and not show him that i‚Äôm sad. I am in therapy, and it‚Äôs been helping a bit, i‚Äôm not feeling as sad anymore, but the anxiety just doesn‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm also doing things to distract myself when i‚Äôm at home(mostly reading and puzzles, i haven‚Äôt had any motivation to play any games) but these thoughts never really leave my mind.

I feel like i‚Äôve tried so much communicating with him how i‚Äôm feeling and he just says ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry you feel that way‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt really do anything about it. I hate to say it‚Äôs an excuse but since recently he‚Äôs just been saying ‚Äúeverything fucking sucks‚Äù

TL;DR: my boyfriend has been distant because of serious things going on his personal life. I can‚Äôt comprehend how he‚Äôs feeling but i understand and want to give him his space. But i feel like he doesn‚Äôt care to see me and spend at least sometime in person with me. I feel really selfish and don‚Äôt really know how to deal with it.

So my question is if i should straight up ask him if he still wants to be with me? Or if he even cares to see me?",1,1732330480.0,relationships,4,1.0,False
1gxppx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gxppx0/what_is_the_most_comfortable_living_room_furniture/,What is the most comfortable living room furniture?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a mission to create the perfect living room setup, and I thought I'd share my experience and findings with you all. After months of research and testing different furniture pieces, I've discovered some game-changing comfort secrets.

Let's start with the star of any living room - the sofa. I recently found this amazing deal on a super comfortable sofa that literally changed my life (check it out here: https://athometouch.com/sofa). Trust me, I've sat on countless couches, but this one hits different. The cushions have the perfect balance of softness and support, and the fabric feels incredibly luxurious.

But comfort isn't just about the sofa. I've learned that creating a cozy living space requires a holistic approach. Here's what I've found works best:

1. Sectional Sofas: These are fantastic for families or anyone who loves to spread out. They're versatile and can be arranged in different ways to suit your space.

2. Recliners: A good recliner is like a hug for your whole body. Look for ones with lumbar support and soft, breathable fabrics.

3. Ottoman/Coffee Table Combo: This is a game-changer! You can put your feet up while having a surface for your drinks and snacks.

4. Accent Chairs: Adding a plush accent chair creates an extra cozy spot for reading or chatting.

5. Quality Throw Pillows: Don't skimp on these! They're not just decorative; they provide crucial support for your lower back and neck.

Speaking of quality, I can't stress enough how important it is to invest in well-made furniture. After going through several cheaper sofas that fell apart within months, I finally found this gem (https://athometouch.com/sofa). The construction quality is outstanding, and it's designed to last for years.

Here's a pro tip: When choosing living room furniture, consider the height of your seating. Your feet should comfortably touch the ground while sitting, with your knees at a 90-degree angle. This prevents strain on your lower back.

Also, don't forget about texture! Mix and match different materials like leather, velvet, and woven fabrics to create a rich, inviting atmosphere. I've found that layering textures makes the space feel more welcoming and comfortable.

For those wondering about maintenance, most quality furniture pieces now come with stain-resistant fabrics. This is especially important if you have kids or pets (or if you're clumsy like me!).

Temperature comfort is also crucial. Choose breathable fabrics for warmer climates and cozier materials for cooler regions. This makes a huge difference in how comfortable you feel while lounging.

Remember, comfort is subjective, but these guidelines have worked wonders for me and my family. We spend so much time in our living rooms - it's worth getting it right!

1gxppvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1gxppvr/i_kinda_give_up/,I kinda give up ,"New-ish manager, I went from the bottom to team lead to manager in about 2 years and this is my first management position. We're a very small but successful business, only 6 of us total including myself and the owner. Im very very hands on with the team, always making sure they have the help they need while also trying to make sure my tasks get done at the same time. I'm pulled in all directions all at once and I kinda love it!

Anyway, I have always had an open door policy, whether they want to talk to me about work issues, help with anything, advice, even personal venting, I'm always going to be there for my team. I ensure the day flows smoothly, I delegate tasks and train everyone on new tasks so we can look into promotions and raises, I always tell my team how proud I am of them and how hard they work,  I've been told I'm ""too nice"" with disciplinary actions, I personally order lunch for everyone, bring coffees for everyone, baked goods, even ""survival kits"" with mittens, hand warmers, hand sanitizer, hair ties etc. that they can keep in their lockers to make the day to day a bit easier. I try my absolute best to be the best manager I possibly can and am constantly looking to improve.

Not that I expect it, but I've never received a thank you. It seems to always be a hate train on me, the second I make a mistake or forget something, someone immediately runs to the owner to ""have a conversation"" about me. My job description is different and I have a whole other side to do in the office doing admin, reception and management tasks vs being on the floor and being with the team. I feel like I can't step away to complete my tasks without them thinking and saying I'm ditching them to ""sit in the office"" when there's a whole other side to running the facility that they don't see. In general I just feel completely unappreciated and disrespected. It just makes me feel guilty that I have other tasks and that I sometimes have to ""ditch them"" (their words, not mine) 

Is there any way I can avoid this without blatantly telling them that my job is different than theirs? Is it always going to be a hate train on management? Should I get used to/ is it normal to feel unappreciated or is that just me being too emotional? 

We had an employee quit who told the owner I was worse than the previous manager (who was quite an evil person, literally bullied the employees). I'm just really having a hard time digesting that and trying to self reflect on where I'm going wrong here and what I possibly could have done to make her feel that way.",3,1732330438.0,managers,3,0.71,False

It's my second birthday today! I was supposed to die 9 years ago on this date ‚Ä¶ but I didn't. And that is worth celebrating! 

I started my day off right with some fantastic morning sex with the beautiful stranger from last night, an out of towner here for the weekend. I'll see him and enjoy him again tonight. 

I guess he's not really a stranger anymore though. I met him originally a little over a month ago, he was here for some training for the weekend. We hit it off, fucked all weekend and decided to stay in touch just in case. 

I'm glad we stayed in touch because he came back for training this weekend and it's kinda great that it happened, I really needed something good. And he is good. I needed the universe to give me something special this weekend and it did not disappoint. 

He's got a good, big dick, nice arms, soft eyes and a gentle soul. He's a really good lay and we have excellent conversation. It's perfect that he doesn't live here and it's also perfect that he's here this weekend. 

Anyshit, I'm off to grab some coffee and to be a hedonist all day long. There will be life affirming acts all day, so basically lots and lots of orgasms! I think I'll rub one out right now before walking to the coffee shop. I'll try to only fantasize about the stranger but I know I'll end up thinking about someone else ‚Ä¶ not the man associated with today, but the man who left that I can't stop wanting. I always end up thinking about him when I'm fucking myself. 

I wonder how he's doing today. I *hope* he's doing great. I *hope* he feels loved today, and everyday. I miss him so very much, what I wouldn't do to be with him again ‚Ä¶  

But I'm not and likely won't ever be with him again. Maybe someday I'll stop wanting him, just not today. But that's ok, I'm going to smile and celebrate my own existence today. 

Because today is the day that another man wanted me dead. But I chose to live and I continue to choose to love instead.

My new patient doesn't even need treatment, she just needs someone to help her get out of here","Between 1984 and 1988, a particular metro area in the southeastern United States suffered a spat of violent murders.



The victims had no commonalities. Age, gender, color, appearance, occupation, socioeconomic status ‚Äî nothing matched. Victims included middle school students and notorious cartel members, street cops and lawyers, charity directors and investment bankers, pharmaceutical executives and gas station clerks.¬†



The only reason authorities had any idea that the murders were related was because of the killer‚Äôs unique calling card:



A scattering of blood-drenched pigeon feathers.	



As months passed and the body count mounted, law enforcement came into possession of one single piece of eyewitness testimony:



Following the violent death of a firefighter, a middle-aged woman was spotted limping away from the scene, bleeding profusely from a gaping wound in her hip. According to the witness the woman was tiny, birdlike in her thinness, shuffling like someone elderly. Notably, a flock of pigeons followed her, bobbing along beside her like an urban adaptation of the pied piper.



This sighting was ultimately dismissed due to one impossible detail:



The woman was covered in grey feathers.



A second sighting was reported one year later, and was again dismissed. Similar sightings continued to crop up over the years, every one of them ignored.



In 1988 and entirely by chance, a bloody feather came into possession of AHH during the commission of a separate task. The feathers were then brought to NASCU. Peculiarities surrounding the appearance and physiology of the feathers were noted by specialized personnel, most notably T-Class Agent Wolf.¬†



At this time, the agency launched an investigation of its own.¬†



The investigation culminated in July 1988. During surveillance of the target ‚Äî a very thin woman who was always trailed by a flock of pigeons, and who always wore a long, heavy trenchcoat, even in the humid summer heat ‚Äî she managed to infiltrate a house that functioned as a front for human trafficking.¬†



What resulted was a bloodbath.

¬†

The target was badly wounded and therefore sufficiently weakened due to the energy expended during the attack. Agency personnel were able to take her into custody. Her capture was not without incident, as the flock of pigeons surrounding her began to attack. One pigeon, a particularly large male with one eye, refused to leave her side. As a result, the animal was brought into custody with her. He was later observed to pluck his feathers and place them on top of the woman‚Äôs astounding number of serious wounds.



Incredibly, the feathers facilitated rapid healing.



It must be noted that the woman came into Agency custody during a time when consideration and respect for our extraordinary inmates was at a low ebb. Due to her dress, her age, her general appearance, and of course her flock of pigeons, personnel dubbed the entity The Bag Lady.



The Bag Lady is a middle-aged woman of almost extraordinary thinness. Her hair is short and grey. Her eyes are large and a vivid, bright orange identical in hue to the eyes of the pigeon who came into custody with her.



Like her pigeon, she is covered in feathers.¬†



Unlike many inmates, the Bag Lady is articulate, intelligent, and possesses full speech and language capabilities. Nevertheless,¬† for the entire length of her incarceration, the Bag Lady has refused to speak with staff for any meaningful length of time. When asked why, her answer is always the same:



‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt talk to cops.‚Äù



This is admittedly understandable, given that the Bag Lady acted in an exclusively extrajudicial capacity, to extremely violent effect.¬†



Despite decades of consistent questioning and other, less savory methods to break her down, the Bag Lady has continued to refuse meaningful engagement with Agency personnel. In fact, the only meaningful contact the Bag Lady has had with personnel consists of attacks both attempted and achieved.



On four different occasions, however, she has been observed attempting to engage fellow inmates in conversation.¬†



Notably, the Bag Lady speaks extensively and frequently to her pigeon. The pigeon does not answer, but Agency personnel believe the bird is extraordinarily intelligent and that it communicates with her nonverbally. Due to potential similarities with the inmate called the Heart Bird, the pigeon is as closely monitored as the Bag Lady herself. Concerns over such similarities with the Heart Bird are the primary reason that the Bag Lady has never been evaluated for termination.



Fortunately, the inmate‚Äôs thirty-five year vow of silence was recently broken during an interview with T-Class agent Rachele B. The insights provided are fascinating. The content of the interview poses serious questions regarding the nature of death, free will, the possibility and potential purpose of afterlife, and the processes through which Khthonic entities come into being.



One might even dare to say it provides a few answers as well.

The first thing my son ever bought was birdseed.



He was four years old. His grandma put two dollars in his Christmas card that year, and he spent those dollars on pigeon food.



Michael loved pigeons. He started talking to them before he ever said a word to me. Watched them from windows when he was a baby and cooed at them the way they coo at each other. His first smile was at them, not at me. His first hello went to a baby pigeon blinking stupidly in a nest on our fire escape.



He loved them.



As he got older, that love grew stronger. By the time he was kindergarten, those birds would follow him everywhere, bobbing their little heads. They ate out of his hands, flew down to his arms, sometimes even landed on his head which made him laugh like nothing else.¬†





I‚Äôd been afraid of birds my whole life, so I didn‚Äôt understand. I asked him one time why he loved them so much. How he could make friends with them.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy, Mom,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPigeons think everyone‚Äôs their friend. They already love you. All you do is love them back.‚Äù



I still didn‚Äôt understand. Didn‚Äôt really want to, I guess. I grew up learning that pigeons were vermin. Dirty, ugly, unsanitary, brainless disease carriers. No, I didn‚Äôt understand at all.



But I did understand this:



Like pigeons, my son thought everyone was his friend.¬†



When describing Michael, you might use the word ‚Äúgullible.‚Äù But that isn‚Äôt right. He wasn‚Äôt gullible. He was smart, he was intuitive, he understood everyone. He could look at the worst person alive and find the smallest, weakest spark of goodness flickering forlornly in the vast dark.



What he couldn‚Äôt understand ‚Äî what I couldn‚Äôt make him understand no matter how hard I tried, how loud I yelled, how mean or desperate or cruel I got ‚Äî was that a spark is not light.



A spark is just a spark. No more, and maybe less.



I could tell you about Michael‚Äôs friends. How some were born monsters. How some were made. How badly the ones that were made‚Äîthe ones that weren‚Äôt born ruined‚Äî heart my hurt.



And how that spark of sympathy got my guard just enough to make sure I lost my son.



I saw him for the last time when he was seventeen.



We were fighting about his friends. Not the pigeons, I‚Äôd gotten used to them a long time ago. How they clustered around the fire escape every morning waiting for him to open the window, how they flocked down to the building entrance when it was time for him to leave for work, how his favorite bird, Mr. One-Eye, dive-bombed onto his shoulder every time they saw each other.¬†



No, we weren‚Äôt fighting about pigeons. We were fighting about his other friends.



It wasn‚Äôt even a bad fight. Not worse than any of our other fights, anyway. It went the same way it always did, he told me I didn‚Äôt understand like he always did, I told him he was being a little fool and his friends would be the end of him like I always did.



And he walked out the door to cool off, like he always did.



I thought he‚Äôd call a few hours later, apologizing and asking for an apology in return like he always did.



But he didn‚Äôt call.



I told myself he‚Äôd come home, like he always did.



But he didn‚Äôt come home.



And nobody cared.



My boy never coming back was the worst thing. The very, very worst thing that is, was, or will ever be.



But the fact that no one helped, that no one cared, that no one gave the tiniest spark of a damn, was almost as terrible.



I went to the police seventeen times. Seventeen. One for each year he‚Äôd been alive. Each time they told me Michael was practically an adult, we‚Äôd had a fight, and he was fully in his rights not to come home. One cop even had the gall to me it was about time he stopped coming home. Another one said I was lucky he was gone, because otherwise he‚Äôd probably come home one day and cut my throat for drug money.



The last cop took pity on me. She was a lady officer. Lady is the wrong word. She was a battle ax. Built like a brick shithouse, with hair like rusty steel wool and the scariest eyes I have ever seen.¬†



But when she looked at me after I taking my seventeenth report, there was nothing scary about her eyes. They were only tired. Sad. And lightless.



That look in her eyes was how I knew no one would ever find my son, and that was the scariest thing of all.



‚ÄúListen to me, hon,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is going to sound like the worst thing in the world. That‚Äôs because it is. But it‚Äôs also the only true thing anyone in this department is going to tell you. We have almost no resources. The few resources that we do have? They go to priorities. A dopehead dropout won‚Äôt ever be a priority. But you can bet your ass some of the cops here will make it their priority to end a dopehead, especially one who‚Äôs a peewee gangbanger. No one is going to help you. No one cares about your son but you.‚Äù	



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù I told her, even though I knew she wasn‚Äôt.



I didn‚Äôt give up. I‚Äôll never give up on my boy. I went to other places for help. Citizen groups, social services, activists, community foundations, charities, all those places. At first it was wonderful. At first I thought I‚Äôd found my people, because unlike the cops they listened. They listened when I told them about my son, about how the first thing he ever bought was birdseed and how the first word he ever said was for a baby pigeon and how Mr. One-Eye rode on his shoulder and how he could look at the worst person alive and find the good. They listened to me and they gave me hugs and coffee and cookies and prayers and recommendations to grief groups and then they listened again.



But they didn‚Äôt *do* anything.



Finally, I‚Äôd had enough of people who didn‚Äôt do anything.¬†



When I said so to one of the group leaders ‚Äî the one who was the best listener, the one who held my hands whenever I cried ‚Äî said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre your people. We‚Äôre here for you. We care about you.‚Äù



Grief and rage and frustration erupted. The most acute, potent frustration I‚Äôd ever felt, the kind that renders you mindless. ‚ÄúI need you to care about my son.‚Äù



‚ÄúI understand. I hear you.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo. No. You‚Äôre wrong. I think you‚Äôre wrong. I think you haven‚Äôt heard a goddam word I said.‚Äù



‚ÄúI have. I do. I‚Äôm always here for you. I‚Äôm listening. But‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚Äú*But what?‚Äù*

  


She looked at me, eyes tired and full of pity. ‚ÄúWe only have as much as we have. We can only do what we can with what we have. What else do you want me to do?‚Äù



‚ÄúSomething,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù



But she didn‚Äôt.



No one did. No one but me.



And I kept on keeping on. Not because I wanted to, but because sometimes that‚Äôs all you get: The ability to put one foot in front of the other. Left, right. Left, right until you get somewhere else.



Only I couldn‚Äôt get anywhere else.



The pigeons couldn‚Äôt, either. They didn‚Äôt seem to understand that Michael was gone. As the days after his disappearance bled into weeks and the weeks hemorrhaged into months, the pigeons kept coming. Flocking to the fire escape outside our little window waiting for him to pop out with smiles and birdseed. His favorite pigeon, Mr. One-Eye, even took to following me whenever I left the building. He watched me as if to say, *Where is he? Where did he go? Tell him we‚Äôre waiting. Tell him we love him. Tell him we need him to come back*.



I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how they were feeling. If they were just confused and maybe a little hurt in their little birdbrains, or if they understood. If they hurt as much as me, if they had holes in their hearts like me. Rotting, bottomless voids eating them from the inside out every second of every day.¬†



But I didn‚Äôt know how to ask, and they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to answer anyway.



And then Mr. One-Eye stopped showing up.



He stayed gone for one day, then two, then three and four and five and that‚Äôs when I knew he wasn‚Äôt coming back either. I hated that damned bird for leaving me. He was Michael‚Äôs favorite. Michael had pigeons the way I‚Äôd had dogs, and that particular pigeon was his heart. Mr. One-Eye was the closest thing my sweet boy had to a soul mate.



So if even that bird had given up on him, he was truly gone.



The sixth day after Mr. One-Eye‚Äôs absence was grey and wet somehow dead. Rain sheeted from the sky, but without any ferocity, without any power. It felt tired, hopeless, helpless to stop itself from falling.¬†



I was kicking my way home from work, tired and hopeless and helpless as the rain. I didn‚Äôt want to go to work. I didn‚Äôt want to come home from work, either. I didn‚Äôt want to walk. But I was still walking. Eyes down, one foot in front of the other. Left, right. Left, right. All rain could do was fall, grey rain on grey streets. All I could do was walk, grey girl on grey streets.



And then, out of the corner of my eye, so colorful it was almost obscene, I saw something.



Brightness against the rain-slick concrete, a small explosion of and white grey and sloppy wet red.



I almost ignored it. One foot in front of the other because that‚Äôs all you can do. Left, right. Left, right. Shoes slapping the sidewalk, dull and pointless, grey and empty.



But that explosion of white and red didn‚Äôt stay an explosion. It began to resolve. To take form.¬†



And the form it took was blood-caked feathers.¬†



The form it took was a crumpled grey chest shimmering all pink and green and white as it panted. A pigeon. A pigeon some asshole had kicked out of the way, or maybe even stepped on, and left to die. A pigeon who hadn‚Äôt run away from danger because it thought everyone was its friend, and what friend would ever be a danger?



I had never seen anything so pathetic. I almost left it.



But then I thought of Michael, and couldn‚Äôt bear to leave it there.



As I approached it, something bloomed in my chest. A feeling. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what that feeling was, only that it was suffocating.



I stopped and looked at the pigeon. It looked back with a single orange eye, fever-bright and fading even as I watched.¬†



It turned its head weakly.



And that‚Äôs when I saw it was missing an eye.



The sheer weight of grief forced me to my knees. But that weight couldn‚Äôt keep me from crawling across the grey, flooded sidewalk. It couldn‚Äôt keep me from scooping up that bright bloody explosion with desperate tenderness. It couldn‚Äôt keep me from cradling that Mr. One-Eye to my chest like I‚Äôd cradled my son a lifetime ago.¬†



I sat there in the rain until long after night fell, sobbing and holding the bird to my heart long after he stopped moving. People passing by took me for homeless. A few dropped coins into my lap. One lady even knelt down and tried to coax me to a shelter down the road, til I screamed in her face and spat.



No one stopped to help me after that.¬†



At some point, I stood up and staggered home. I brought Mr. One-Eye with me, holding him to my heart all the while.



I got drunk that night. Blind, stinking, hideously drunk. Not because I like drinking. I hate it. But I hated having to feel the hole in my heart more. This rotting void, a bottomless chasm eating me from the inside out every second of every day. It felt like I should be dead. Only I wasn‚Äôt. I felt like I was always dying but never got to be dead.¬†



Dead would have been better, but I couldn‚Äôt die. If I died then no one on earth would care what happened to my baby.



So I got drunk instead of dead. I didn‚Äôt really think it would work. I hoped that it would. I always hope. Hope is the only thing some of us ever get.



But being drunk didn‚Äôt work.¬†



Being drunk just made me angrier and crazier. Being drunk made the rotting pit inside me grow up and out until it was swallowing me whole. Until it was the only thing in the world. Until it was the only thing I knew, the only thing I had ever known, the only thing I would ever know.¬†



I thought I was by myself in that void, until I looked out the window and saw the pigeons on the fire escape. They alone were there in the pit with me. They alone understood. They alone cared what had happened to my son.¬†



So I opened the window by the fire escape and told them to come inside, sobbing every word. They swirled back in a panic, wings thundering.¬†



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I wept. ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt leave. Don‚Äôt leave. Come in. Come in here you goddamned morons, come in.‚Äù



I reached for them.



Everything tilted. The metal window sill bit into my belly, then scraped down my legs as the world flipped upside down.



The last thing I knew was the rush of wings, deafening but soft.



Beautifully, perfectly, profoundly soft.

	



For the first time that I could remember, I woke up in somebody‚Äôs arms.	



I opened my eyes.



A face looked down at me. An old man with round golden eyes and the gentlest smile I have ever seen, will probably ever see.



I craned my neck. Pigeons surrounded us, a shifting, bright-eyed flock so huge it spilled off the sidewalks into the street. Their eyes shone like embers in the dark.



I looked back at the man. His eyes shone too, and so did the skin of his face. He wasn‚Äôt human. He couldn‚Äôt be. For some reason, that didn‚Äôt frighten me at all.



‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I crane my neck. ‚ÄúAre you an angel?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo. I am One Who Listens.‚Äù



It sounds ridiculous, but I could literally *hear* the big letters in that title. They came out of his mouth capitalized.



‚ÄúWho listens to what?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúI listen to prayers. I listen to pain. I listen to rage. I listened to yours, you know.‚Äù He smiled again, teeth shimmering.



‚ÄúThen why‚Ä¶‚Äù I blinked and shifted, groaning as electric pain bolted up my hip. ‚ÄúIf you listened to me, why didn‚Äôt you ever answer?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause We Who Listen can never answer loudly. Sometimes we cannot answer at all. Each answer, however soft and quiet, takes from us. Often it takes something we aren‚Äôt supposed to give. Always, it gives something we can never get back. See.‚Äù It held out its bare arms for my inspection. My stomach churned violently as the streetlight illuminated a relief map of pitted scars and wormlike welts and suppurating rotted pits like radiation burns.¬†



‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I gasped.



‚ÄúI listened, and I answered.‚Äù He shook his silvery sleeves back down over his arms. ‚ÄúMy answers took what I did not have to give.‚Äù



Frustration bubbled up, hot and poisonous. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do anything, then‚Ä¶I mean, what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù



‚ÄúThere is no point, I think,‚Äù he said gently. ‚ÄúIt simply is.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúAre you a guardian angel?‚Äù I repeated.



‚ÄúWe are not guardians,‚Äù it said, gently. ‚ÄúWe are listeners.‚Äù



‚ÄúWho is we?‚Äù



‚ÄúMe‚Äù. He placed a hand on his chest. ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù He pressed his other hand against my chest. ‚ÄúWe.‚Äù



I looked at him, revolted as terror built in my gut. ‚ÄúAm I dead?‚Äù



‚ÄúThere is no death for us.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I do *not* understand.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe who were suffering, we who were alone, now go to others who are suffering and alone. We stay with them and we listen. We listen so they can feel comfort.‚Äù



I had so many questions, but couldn‚Äôt articulate a single one. ‚ÄúAnd you ‚Äîyou were you with me? You saw my‚Ä¶my pain, all that rage, heard all those questions?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I never felt you.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know. Sometimes, that is the way it is. But still we try. Still, we do what we must do.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou said you answered. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre hurt. You gave answers to someone. Who?‚Äù I sat up, grimacing as my arm twanged. ‚ÄúAnd why wasn‚Äôt it me?‚Äù



Before he could tell me, I looked down at my hands. Incredibly, I was still holding Mr. One-Eye. Even more incredibly, he was still alive. His poor sunken eye fixed me with a dulled orange gaze.



And something shot me in the heart.



The force of a freight train, burning just like a bullet, boring through me. Instead of smoke, it left a question in its wake:



*hurts stop it stop it hurting stop please*

  


Without thinking ‚Äî only feeling‚Äî I cradled Mr. One-Eye to my chest and held him.



Pain erupted in my shoulder, overwhelming and familiar. The rotting void, endless and eternal, boring a tunnel to my very core, manifesting as a caving wound.



But this time, it didn‚Äôt spread.



It didn‚Äôt grow. It didn‚Äôt swallow me and the world surrounding. It did not become the only thing I had known, or the only thing I knew, or the only thing I would ever know. It stayed where it was, confined to its tunnel. It had no choice, because there was something more important in my hands. Something bright and living. Something alive and whole.



Mr. One-Eye shifted his wings, then stretched upward. I raised him so he could look at me. His beautiful, sparkling orange eye met mine.



Then he stretched out, beak catching the fabric of my coat, and stepped onto my shoulder.



For the first time since my son was born, I felt whole.¬†



He Who Listens wasn‚Äôt quite so thrilled.



‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù he wailed. Tears welled in his great yellow eyes as he stared at the ghastly wound in my arm. I stared, too. I couldn‚Äôt help it. It looked as rotten as it felt, a huge, ruptured wound tunneling through my arm. ‚ÄúIt will never go away. It will never fade. It will only grow. You will have that wound and feel that pain growing until it finally consumes you.‚Äù



Before I could say a word, Mr. One-Eye flapped his wings. The feathers whacked my face, shockingly strong.¬†



Immediately, the pigeons around us responded.



They came in a bobbing grey wave, pooling around my feet where the began to preen. As I watched, the dropped their preened feathers ‚Äî glistening, shimmering grey overlaid with every color of the rainbow ‚Äî at my feet.



When the last pigeon had dropped the last feather, Mr. One-Eye tucked his head under his wing and pulled out a feather of his own. Then he crept his way down my arm ‚Äîone foot in front of the other, left, right, left right ‚Äîand placed his feather inside my wound.¬†



The feather lay atop it for a moment, shining. Then it melted into that rotting crater, leaving a delicate thread of whole, unblemished flesh stretched across the hole.



I reached down and grabbed the pile of feathers at my feet, stuffing it into the hole. It was like magic. It *was* magic. Each feather shone and melted into fresh flesh. Two handfuls later, there was no wound. After three, there wasn‚Äôt even a scar.



By the end, even the pain was gone.



I laughed.



It felt alien to laugh, rusty, even wrong. But it came out anyway, erupting out of me like a geyser.¬†



As I laughed, He Who Listens wept.



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he moaned. ‚ÄúNo, no, no. What are you doing? This is *wrong*.‚Äù¬† Tears fell from his great yellow eyes, shining like diamonds under the street lights. Suddenly, I felt guilty.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know. I won‚Äôt do it again.‚Äù



His face broke apart. ‚ÄúYou are lying and you don‚Äôt even know it. If I show you what we do, you will ruin everything.‚Äù



That actually offended me. ‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt show me anything. It‚Äôs not like I asked.‚Äù



‚ÄúI have no choice,‚Äù he sniffled. ‚ÄúI must do what I must do. You will do what you will do. Come.‚Äù



He toddled down the street. I hesitated for reasons I still don‚Äôt understand. Then I followed.



So did the pigeons.



He Who Listens spun around. ‚ÄúNo! They cannot! *They cannot*!‚Äù



On my shoulder, Mr. One-Eye beat his wings again, whipping my face. The other pigeons obediently dispersed.



He Who Listens continued to argue with me about Mr. One-Eye, but I held my ground. People say you‚Äôre forever responsible for what you tame. I didn‚Äôt tame Mr. One-Eye, but I saved him. I think that makes me even more responsible, and I said so.



‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù he wept. ‚ÄúNo. This is wrong. You will be wrong. What am I to do?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou are to show me what you‚Äôre supposed to show, or leave.‚Äù



‚ÄúI cannot leave. I have no choice.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs get going.‚Äù



He wiped tears from his face and flicked them onto the concrete where they spattered like silvery rain.



And as we moved down the street, I saw people who hadn‚Äôt been there just a few minutes ago. But they all looked like they‚Äôd been there for hours. Languishing in the alleys, spread-eagle on the sidewalks, leaning against buildings as sobs shook their bony shoulders.



As we drew closer, one turned to look at us. Wide yellow eyes glimmered in its round face. A rotting wound glistened under its nose. The flesh of its lips had been eaten to the bone, exposing the teeth.



‚ÄúAre these‚Ä¶do they listen? Are they all like you?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he sobbed. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like you. They did not listen. They answered. They gave too much. They gave what they couldn‚Äôt get back.‚Äù



We walked in silence after that. I avoided his yellow eyes glistening like coins in the night.



He Who Listens spent all night showing me what to do. Not once, not twice or three times, but twelve.



The first time was a homeless man huddled under a bench in the park. He was sobbing in his sleep, and his face ‚Äîweathered but unmistakably young ‚Äî made my heart ache.¬†



‚ÄúSit,‚Äù said He Who Listens.



‚ÄúWhat if he wakes up?‚Äù



‚ÄúHe will not. Sit, and touch him.‚Äù



When I laid my hand on that boy, I felt his yammering heartbeat and saw his pain. I heard it. Worse, I felt it. I felt every terrible step in the tragic procession that led him here. Steps that were his fault, and steps that weren‚Äôt. It didn‚Äôt even matter what was his fault or what wasn‚Äôt. All that mattered was his pain.



Even though I could not take that pain from him, his heart slowed the longer I sat there. By the end, its rhythm was calm and steady. Maybe it was my imagination, but I thought his poor weathered face looked a little less sad, too.



‚ÄúYes,‚Äù He Who Listens said happily. ‚ÄúThat is what we do. We listen, and we provide comfort by listening.‚Äù



Next we went to a lady sitting in a roach-infested studio apartment, hollow-eyed and expressionless as she stared at her blank television screen.



‚ÄúKneel,‚Äù said He Who Listens.



‚ÄúWon't she see me?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot tonight. Kneel, and hold her hand.‚Äù



I did as I was told.¬†



Once again, I heard and saw and felt the most terrible things. Rotting things, things that get inside you and bore tunnels until they kill you. I don‚Äôt know how long I sat with her, but I know that by the end her eyes had closed and she was finally sleeping.



We saw a child next, alone and wide awake in a foster home, crying for her father. Then a young mother weeping in her kitchen. An old man in a nursing home, a teenage boy stomping his way down an empty street while tears coursed down his face, a young woman sobbing by herself in a dark office long after everyone around her had gone home.¬†



It might have been a single night. It might have been a week, or a month, or forever, or ten minutes.



Finally we went to a hospital where a man, balding and exhausted, sat at the bedside of a little girl with sunken eyes and dull, dying skin. I knew she was fading. I knew she would be dead by morning, because when I touched her I felt only the faintest veil of emotion, all of it warm and soft.



So I turned to the father. I didn‚Äôt sit this time. I leaned over him the way I used to lean over my son whenever he cried, and wrapped my arms around him.



His pain hit me with the force of a tsunami, repulsive and powerful.



*Help help help help help I can‚Äôt lose her she deserves more she‚Äôs all I have help her help her help*

  


The sheer force punched through my heart, wide as a freight train, hot as a bullet, painful as death by acid bath.¬†



The man cried out. I thought I‚Äôd hurt him. I recoiled as he lurched forward, reaching for the child on the bed.



Her eyes were open, and color was returning to her face.



‚Äú*What have you done?*‚Äù screamed He Who Listens.



I staggered back, gasping as the wound in my chest pulsed and blood dripped down my chest, soaking my dirty shirt. ‚Äú*You‚Äôve given what you cannot give back! It will consume you!‚Äù*



I barely listened. Single-minded purpose filled me and I knew, in the depths of my missing punched-out heart, that I had to get outside, right now.



Somehow, I did.¬†



The pigeons were waiting for me. An entire flock on the sidewalk, eyes glittering knowingly.



Mr. One-Eye flapped his wings in command. They obeyed, dropping their plucked feathers at my feet. I packed them into my wound. New flesh grew, bright and shimmering as the feathers themselves.



It took longer this time, but that wound healed too.



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù wept He Who Listens. ‚ÄúNo. You cannot do this. You cannot. You are an abomination.‚Äù



I had a vivid mental image of Who He Listens kneeling at my side, stroking my hair, my hands, holding my face as I wept and raged with no knowledge of his presence.¬†



Again I wondered:



What was the *point* of it? ¬†



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúThe abomination is being able to help people, being able to *do* something, but choosing to do nothing.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou are not One Who Listens. You are only a monster.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm One Who Listens and Does Something About It.‚Äù



He left me and didn‚Äôt come back. That was all right. I didn‚Äôt need him.



I only needed the pigeons.¬†



I listened everywhere, to everything and everyone and all their heartbroken, rage-filled, desperate questions. I didn‚Äôt answer all of them. I learned that some people don‚Äôt need answers. Many don‚Äôt even deserve. There are more of those than I ever thought possible.



But some did. I always answered those.



I had no idea what I was. I knew that I was more than I had been. More than myself. And I knew that I was powerful. I even started to wonder if I was a god. Under the circumstances, I think that was a reasonable thing to wonder.



But whether I was a god or not, I could still only be in one place at one time.



That‚Äôs why I needed the pigeons.



Pigeons can only be in one place, too. But there are so many of them that they‚Äôre already everywhere.¬†



I asked them to listen. They answered me.



Because they answered me, I was able to answer so many others.



I answered a boy being beaten by cops as a flock of pigeons watched silently from the roofs above. His dog lay beside him, bleeding from bullet holes and panting raggedly. The boy was holding his dog even though the cops kept hitting his hands. He begged for help. He asked for his mother. He told his dog she was a good girl as she whined, blood spreading across the dirty concrete.



Still, they beat him.



So I struck them down.



One cracked open on the sidewalk. I took his gun and shot the other while he stirred feebly.¬†



The boy looked at me, exhausted and horrified in equal measure, began to pray. I knew he was praying to God, probably to stop me from closer. But I pretended he was praying to me anyway.



I kneeled down and placed my hands on his poor, whining dog.



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt her,‚Äù he wept as agony tunneled through my belly, rotten and corrosive and vile. ‚ÄúPlease. She‚Äôs a good girl.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I told him, then touched his forehead the way I touched my son‚Äôs when he‚Äôd been running a fever. Another bolt of pain shot through my hand. I saw the wound form this time, watched it cave through my palm and spread.



The dog got to her feet and nuzzled her owner, tail wagging even as she whined.



The boy looked at me, wide-eyed and ashen. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt know how to answer. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt want to.



I hobbled my way out of the alley, down a side street and into a narrow little park. The pigeons followed. Mr. One-Eye gave his wing-flapping, face-slapping order. The feathers came, and with it healing.



The birds kept listening, and I kept answering.



They found a woman, dead-eyed and frozen in fear, huddling as a man with dead eyes bore down on her. I tore his head off. She ran before I could put my hands on her to take away her fear.



They found a flea-bitten baby boy in a sodden, sagging diaper screaming for help in a filthy crib while his parents nodded off in an equally filthy corner. I answered the baby, but I punished them.¬†



They found a girl in a group home as she slid a blade up and down her arms and asked for someone who should have done everything to protect her but destroyed her instead to die. I answered.



They found an old woman with a black eye pushing an empty cart along broken sidewalks, asking for her belongings to come back. I answered, but not before punishing the thieves.



They found a man sobbing alone in his car, silently pleading for money to feed his kids for the next three days, just the next three days, please God. I answered. My answer was taken from someone else, but it was given.



They found a mother sobbing for help over her son‚Äôs blue body, a needle still quivering in his arm. I answered her, too. Afterward I found the man who sold her son the drugs, and then I found the people who sold that man the drugs, and then I found the people who gave *them* the drugs, and those people were no more.



I answered pleas against crime bosses and schoolyard bullies, masked monsters and petty criminals, people who inflicted damage by action and people who inflicted damage by inaction.



Dozens, then hundreds, then more. And more.



And more.



Every answer took from me. I think every answer continued to take. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve given so many answers and now they all help each other grow. My answers took and took what I can never get back. Even the birds couldn‚Äôt give back what I gave.¬†



But they gave me enough.



Right up until the day your people found me.



That was my fault. God works best in mysterious ways, especially when those ways are small. I am still mysterious, but I forgot to stay small. I will never make that mistake again.





My birds still bring me questions, you know. They‚Äôre outside right now. On your walls, your roof, your ground, whispering to each other. Whispering to Mr. One-Eye. Whispering to me.



I hear them, even down here.¬†



They aren‚Äôt perfect. Nobody is. Some questions don‚Äôt have answers, and some answers can‚Äôt be found.



My son was one of those.



We tried to find him. My pigeons worked as hard as I ever did. Harder, maybe. We couldn‚Äôt find him. But my boy, he would understand. My boy, he saw the good in everyone and everything. Wherever he is, he sees the good in us not finding him. Because while looking for him ‚Äî searching for an answer, any answer at all ‚Äî we were able to give other people the answers they needed.



You know about those answers. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.



I love these birds as much as my son ever did, maybe more. I think more. I feel him in them sometimes, or at least I imagine that I do. Holding pigeons, teaching pigeons, loving pigeons, isn‚Äôt like having my son back. Nothing will ever be like having him back. But it is the closest thing I have. It is all I have. Sometimes what we have is all we get.



And sometimes, I am the only thing someone gets. Well, me and the birds.



My son knew what he was talking about. These birds are wonderful. They really do think everyone is their friend. They love being held. They love being taught. They love being loved. They love to help.



And they love to listen.



Together, my birds and I are always listening to those who ask for answers. We hear them. Right now, they‚Äôre whispering, right this very minute. We hear them, even down here. I hear their pain, and I hear their rage. That‚Äôs why you cannot keep me forever, no matter how hard you try:



Because hearing their suffering gives me power, and I still hear every minute of the suffering.¬†



I hear the children who beg for help.



I hear the fathers who cry for justice



I hear the mothers who demand vengeance



I hear, because I am One Who Listens.



And I help, because I am The One Who Answers.

It seems strange, or maybe just wrong, for it to nearly be the end of June and I've not written about you or to you this year. I'm not even taking myself away to the beach to mourn you this year. It just didn't feel right and I'm not really sure why. I did decide to spend the weekend in a hotel instead of steaming my clam in my clam shack aka the tin can I'm living in. 

I took today and Monday off, today for self care, grace and love and Monday for a girl's day with one of my favorite people. I think this may be the last year I do anything special for this anniversary, so much of me has changed and you're just another ghost. 

You've been gone almost an entire decade but I still remember everything like it was just yesterday. From the day we met to the day of your death, it's all still so fresh. You were such a good manipulator and liar, truly the best. I was naive and starved for love. But our stars were crossed and once you had a hold of me, you were never going to let go. 

To this day I argue that you loved me as best as you could even though I know that isn't real or true. Love wasn't something you could do or feel. I still romanticize you, believing that you tried to change for me ‚Ä¶ but being locked up was what you really needed. I often wonder if you'd still be alive if your family hadn't bailed you out. 

You'd been clean for 3 months at that point. You were good to me then, so fucking good and I thank you so much for those memories and for showing me that side of you. It broke my heart in the absolute worst way when I knew you'd started using again. I knew then that I'd lost you, I just didn't know how bad it would get for both of us before it was all said and done. 

Today is 06/28/2024. Despite all I've lived through, the worst day of my life remains as 06/29/2015. You and I hadn't talked much in the week leading up - you'd taken off to use again, back in Portland and I had decided I was done, for good, I wasn't coming back to you and I wasn't going to let you come back. And I meant it, too and I think you knew that, I think that's at least part of why you did what you did. 

You messaged me that day, from your mom's phone, said you wanted to see me but I told you no. I could feel your angst, I could feel your anger and hatred. You showed up anyway, where did you get that key, by the way? I tried to keep you out, I knew I was in danger, this wasn't the first time you tried to end my life. 

But you got in and as soon as you were inside the abuse began. You put me through 3 hours of hell. I knew, and I mean I knew that I was going to die that day. I had no doubt. I begged for my life, I begged you to consider my family, that I needed to be alive for them and I remember your response being only ‚Äúfuck your kids‚Äù. You claimed to love them once, same as you did me - but I don't think people like you can actually love anyone. 

I can't recall how many times you choked me to the point of unconsciousness but I do remember waking up 4 different times and immediately being kicked in the chest and stomach. You stomped on my recently healed ribs and broke them again, you were the reason they'd been broken before. You told me of your plans that day, to take my life and then your own, but you couldn't decide if you would use your knife or your gun. 

This wasn't your first time hurting me, but it was the worst and thankfully, it was the last. You held your tec-22 to my head and said ‚ÄúI am going to die today, even if you don't, and I want you to know that it's your fault‚Äù. But then you did something I didn't expect ‚Ä¶ you had to know I would run if I got the chance ‚Ä¶ you had to. It's probably just me doing what I do and seeing or believing in good where there was none, but you had to know. 

I was living in a 19 foot trailer when I first moved here, that trailer only had one internal door and you went into the bathroom and closed that door. You had to know I would run! And I did. Barefoot across gravel and goat heads and right into a neighbor's house. I'd never met them before but their door was unlocked and I ran inside begging for help and telling them to get down and away from the doors/windows. 

You walked out so calm, no emotion on your face, like nothing had just happened inside that hellish place. You got in your car and drove away, the sirens already wailing in the distance. Paramedics arrived and took me to the hospital, surprisingly my ribs were the only part of me that you broke physically. I remember sitting alone in that hospital room and I felt you curse me, then I felt you leave. 

They kept me in that hospital room for quite a long time, considerably longer than needed and I knew something was wrong when a cop walked in somberly. They told me you had shot yourself. They couldn't say what your condition was, they didn't know, they could only say that you'd been life flighted to Portland. 

In your final act you saved 4 lives and helped another person be able to see again. But I *hope* none of those people carry you with them, they don't deserve that. And while I may love you, still, I'm thankful that I survived and I healed. I wish you were still alive, not so I could be with you, but for your mother's sake. You destroyed her by doing what you did. You were her one and only. I still talk to her, y'know, we meet for coffee and lunch a couple of times a year. She's still as sweet as ever and she misses you dearly. 

I still don't really know how I made it through all of that alone ‚Ä¶ I had no friends here, no family, nothing. I went through the darkest time of my life completely and utterly alone. I barely made it, but that's an entry for another day. It took years ‚Ä¶ but I made it through and I healed, that's what matters most. 

I still miss you, the good you, but I don't miss the bad you. And if you were still here today, I'd wish you happiness even though I wouldn't ever want to see you again. You didn't deserve to die and I'll always be sad that you saw that as your only option. I know how that feels, but again, that's an entry for another day. Today is just about you, Romey. 

To the moon and back again, forever and for always. That's what we said. Part of me will always be yours and I will carry you with me until my dying day. I will forever mourn the version of me that died with you that day. And I will forever *hope* to never meet you again. You were my flame and you did exactly what you were meant to do. We both burned, you just burned too bright.

I was gone from my table for no more than three minutes to use their in house comfort room only to return and see my belongings missing and my table occupied by a group of foreigners, to my surprise and bewilderment. Only to find my stuff on another table (which was filthy, mind you).

Out of all the cafes I have stayed in, this was the only time I have experienced something like this.

Justify your strict rules and high prices with better customer service. Improve your standards and do better. Don't be a business with a bias to foreign customers.


EDIT: I confronted the staff with regards to this and they confirmed that it was their manager who moved my things. They apologized on the behalf of their manager (as she was off already), and assured me that they will bring this up to her as soon as possible.

Was living on my own and thriving in a career. Now I'm 37 - living at home with my parents.  I fought my way back to working with physical therapy (and some meds) and worked my way up in hours at my new coffee shop job (36 hours/wk is pretty much my max, but I stand for 9 hours a day and don't immediately crash every day, so I'll take that as a win). It's something, but I'm nowhere near being as independent as I once was.

Everyone that I've seen post that mention a partner seem to have been already with them when they got sick. 

Has anyone even attempted dating after getting CFS? Is it even possible?

I'm going to be following up with the 130 or so bankers who didn't respond to my email last week, but was wondering if I should acknowledge the mistake on my resume and send a revised copy in the follow up email?

- we have elementary aged kids and would like a solid school district, preferably with good arts programs. Big plus if there are neighborhoods where kids can safely walk to school.

- budget is $3800 or less for a 3 bedroom house

- some walkable access to public parks and maybe a coffee shop or two would be great. Not expecting to be able to walk everywhere but having at least some options for a nice walk would be ideal. I love having some sort of outdoor access, trails, water, etc 

- less than a 30 minute commute to the University District by car or public transit would be great

- if it exists, it would be great to have a neighborhood with community events or some good options for meeting other people from time to time

I (25F) share a condo with my roommate Sara (26F). Sara and I have been friends for a few years, and since we live together, she offered to throw me a small birthday party at our place. I was on board with it because I don‚Äôt like huge gatherings and prefer intimate celebrations with close friends. I have slight social anxiety as well.

Leading up to the party, I asked her what the plans were, and she assured me it would be a ""small get-together,"" just a few of our mutual friends, cake, and maybe a movie. That sounded perfect to me.

Well, the day of the party rolls around, and when I came home, I quickly realized it was *anything* but small. Sara had invited a ton of people‚Äîat least 50. Some were mutual friends, but a lot were people I barely knew or hadn‚Äôt even met before. She had also set up a bunch of party decorations, hired a DJ, and there was even a huge table of food and drinks. It felt like a full-blown house party, not the chill gathering I was expecting.

I immediately felt overwhelmed. I don‚Äôt do well in big social situations, especially when I‚Äôm the center of attention, and this was way more than I had anticipated. I pulled Sara aside and asked her why she invited so many people when we had agreed on something small. She shrugged it off and said, ‚ÄúOh, come on, it‚Äôs your birthday! I wanted to make it special!‚Äù

I appreciated the effort, but this wasn‚Äôt what I wanted at all. I felt completely uncomfortable and anxious. After trying to stick it out for a bit, I just couldn‚Äôt handle it and decided to leave. I ended up going to a nearby coffee shop to calm down and clear my head.

After I left, Sara texted me, asking where I was. I told her that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with the party and that I needed some space. She was upset and said I was being ungrateful for everything she did for me. Now some of our friends are saying I overreacted and that Sara was just trying to be nice by throwing me a big party.

I feel bad for leaving, but I also feel like she completely ignored what I wanted. AITA for walking out of my own birthday party because it wasn‚Äôt the ""small"" event I expected?

It is completely okay to beat and torture these women- the only ones who you know can give birth. 

And they could be pregnant at any moment, and yet they still allowed to be treated like shit. No wine or coffee but its cool if the wife smashes her head into a wall. For an aunt to burn their hands and shock them with cattle prods. 

You would think think that since they are considered such valuable resources they would be treated better. Like yeah you don't need eyes and non burned skin to give birth, but like... its best not to be extremely stressed. I get they are basically cattle, but still. 

And then all these infertile women- the Wives- are some of the highest ranking people in the society?? Like they care so much about fertility, you would think they would annul the marriages and marry the men to the fertile women. Still assault and evil but... It seems much more sound. 

And then these infertile men are in charge and the seemingly fertile ones are drivers? I understand this is an inherently Christian society which is about overpowering women and white supremist but like... why not test the men? And make the fertile ones in charge? Was that never an idea? You would think something like sexual vitality and fertility would be status symbols.

This all seems so anti baby making to me. ",16,1732329184.0,TheHandmaidsTale,3,0.9,False

I was just having one cup in the morning, but something about it completely destroyed my sense of thirst for the rest of the day. Does anyone have ideas about why this happened?

And FWIW, I got some electrolyte tablets this afternoon, and as soon as I took a sip of the water, it was like I'd been in a desert - I was so thirsty that I ended up chugging half the liter in one go. And I've had another 1.5 liters since (which is quite a bit given that I only bought the electrolytes about 5 hours ago), so I'm clearly extremely dehyrdated.

I didn't think we would ever be able to do this. A Yr ago we were drinking every night, for me vodka for my husband beer an some nights whiskey too. An always with alot of weed. In fact we smoked more than we drank. For me this will also be a year today.For  My husband it will be March before its a year. Now we go out for meals, buy clothes, we bought train tickets an went an stayed in an expensive hotel. All things that would have been impossible a year ago. Then it would have always been ,' do we still have enough for weed an beer??' If we buy the weed an beer can we afford the train and  hotel??, we'll have to borrow the money, so  we can do this! But now, we can afford things. I have a little job cleaning, something I would not have done then. We have enough for family get togethers,  new clothes, i get mine an my daughters nails done, got my ears pierced an my nose, paid for daughter to have hers done too,we can go for coffee or lunch with my mum an mother in law, we can visit our grandchild without stinking of last nights booze!! Or weed on our clothes, our house smells clean an is so tidy, my mental health is so much better and my husband goes swimming an to the gym.
Thank you to all of you who posted or supported us, for your brave stories that helped keep me sober, for reminding me an us that we can do this  that tomorrow is another day, that being sober means we get so much more life!!

I'm sitting alone on this warm Saturday morning, enjoying my routine hippy speed-ball (a cup of coffee and a joint) and I'm trying to fight my mind's natural desire to ruminate and analyze. I only fight it now because I woke up with him on my mind and I know I'll just end up crying and I really don't want to do that today. 

I know I'll end up crying at some point today ‚Ä¶ but I really do try to fight it. The ache is heavy today, it was heavy yesterday too. I still don't understand why some days are so much harder than other days. Or why, on days like today, it feels exactly the same as the day he first went away. 

I used to really enjoy my periods of rumination, they were times of deep thought and healthy processing. Now it's obsessive, dark and negative. All because of one heartbreak. That's how trauma works sometimes and this one heartbreak basically destroyed years of work. 

Why's this shit gotta be so hard? Just don't fuck with people. Don't fuck with their hearts, don't fuck with their heads. Don't ever assume to know a person's strength or ability to overcome ‚Äì you never know ‚Ä¶ you just never fucking know. 

If you can't love someone, then just leave them the fuck alone. That's my new motto. It really is just that fucking simple. I am so tired of people who lie. ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù spoken from a forked tongue is a quick and deadly poison for some ‚Ä¶ especially for someone who's only ever wanted love ‚Ä¶ for someone like me. 

I know I'm a little bit different from other people, I get that ‚Ä¶ I don't expect people to be like me or to think or to feel anything the same way I do. But I just don't understand dishonesty, especially in matters of the heart. I know I've hurt a heart or two in my lifetime, but not through dishonesty, quite the opposite actually. 

I really do try to live my life in such a way that I don't have to apologize for anything. I try to live authentically and without regret. I sometimes wish things were different but I don't regret anything. I've never struggled with accepting things or people as they are. The only person I've ever tried to change is myself. I have tried to live as gently as I possibly can ‚Ä¶ and life has met me with incredible violence. 

I don't and won't let it harden me. I have lost so much along the way but I swear I'll never lose my softness. Life can beat me into nothing, I don't care. My heart is too broken to love again, my light has gone dim, my eyes are blind and my soul dances between extremes, an undulating ball of sorrow that burns both hot and cold. 

I remain soft, I remain gentle. But I am closed. I can't afford to bring anyone else in. Life has already taken the best of me, I've got to protect what's left of me. I always wanted to give all that I could and all that I had ‚Ä¶ just not like this. I only wanted someone to love my softness. 

I didn't make it through writing this with a dry eye, obviously I cried. 

Anyfuck, I'm off to get ready for a night of drinking, debauchery and degeneracy. It'll probably just be a night of drinking but a girl can always hope for extra D.

I first learned about this through vague comments on this subreddit but only discovered it on the website about a month ago. 

I've been casually using the dreaming Spanish platform for a bit over a year but only more seriously for the past six months. 

Throughout this time I often found myself scrolling through the endless options trying to find something interesting and often stopping videos halfway if I had troubles engaging or understanding the content. This led to a lot of decision making fatigue and very slowly increasing my input time. 

Everything changed for me when I discovered the sorting videos from easy to hard function. 

Now I simply sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and watch the next video in line often getting an hour or more of effortless input daily. What I'm learning is that the most engaging videos are the ones I can best understand. It's been so motivating to learn new words everyday and consistently deepen my comprehension. It really pays off to stick to your level, I used to feel like I understood what was being communicated but I'm now learning how much depth I was missing out on.

My sister and I were best friends. She was my entire world. I can‚Äôt remember a time when I didn‚Äôt first go to her with my problems, and when she wasn‚Äôt happy and ready to listen. There were some days when I couldn‚Äôt go on without talking to her. Not to be too cheesy, but she was my rock. I loved my sister with my whole heart. She was always very private, and didn‚Äôt share a lot with me, but I was told to respect that want. She loved me, and I knew we were close. We had a bond. She was my role model. She‚Äôd volunteer on the weekends, donate to charity, and was just an awesome person. My sister passed away last week, and it was insanely hard to process. My parents asked me to go and sort her possessions, and even though it felt hard, I agreed because I knew she wouldn‚Äôt want anybody else doing it.

I, of course, became somewhat of a snoop. I mean, I knew it was wrong, but I wanted to know something about my sister. Her laptop was out on the coffee table, and I just had to look at it! Her password was easy to guess, and I got lucky. She had her messages synced to her laptop, so I went through them. Again, bad thing to do. I shouldn‚Äôt have done it. But I did it, and I wish I never did. She was blackmailing her ex with his nudes, threatening to leak them if he didn‚Äôt give her the dog they‚Äôd bought together. She was harassing a woman at her work, trying to force her to quit. She also claimed to having an affair with her married boss and the head of their HR department, so if she went to either of them, she would just get them to fire her. It was horrible. In her conversations with her friends, she would bully and make fun of them, then turn around and act like their friend. She would make fun of me and our parents, post pictures of me and describe everything wrong with me. If I told her something, it got back to her friends and they would pile on and insult me. She made catfish profiles on dating apps. She made fake accounts on numerous websites to bully a girl from her high school (she still lived in our hometown- I found the list of accounts in her computer‚Äôs notes). It was horrific. I felt like I was looking at a stranger‚Äôs computer.

I don‚Äôt know how to process it. This isn‚Äôt half as hard as dealing with her death, but it just feels like such a sucker punch and I don‚Äôt know how to deal. I‚Äôm planning to seek therapy, but just some slightly urgent help might be useful. How do I feel... Okay about this? How do I reconcile the image of my angel sister with this? What should my next steps be?

TL;DR: I found out that my deceased sister is a bully, a blackmailer, and just an overall not very kind person.

My very good friend told me I need to take all my crazy writings and publish them ‚Ä¶ she loves everything I write though, I feel like her opinion is a bit biased perhaps, which I don't mind. It's a strange thought for me because I really only write for him. 

But I can't deny that since I met him the floodgates have been open, it's been an unstoppable force, this compulsion to write. Don't get me wrong, writing has always been a wonderful and healing outlet for me, but this is different ‚Ä¶ the way I write is different, the frequency, the tone, the *need* to get it all out of my head ‚Ä¶ it's all so different. 

I've dated and fucked a lot of men, I've only loved a select few, but none like this and none of them compelled me the way he did, the way he still does despite his absence and silence. 

I've never fallen so quickly, so completely, so pathetically ‚Ä¶ I don't understand. I've spent the greater part of a year trying to understand, trying to move on, trying everything I can to ease this ache ‚Ä¶ to no avail.

I wanted to be on my knees for him, but not like this. I wanted to choke on his cock, not the grief of his absence. Why's it so hard to find someone who will break my back and not my heart? 

This is so fucking dumb, I am so fucking dumb. How did I get so hung up on this man? I don't understand. It's just so fucking dumb. 

Love is so fucking dumb. 

And I miss it so fucking much. I miss him ‚Ä¶ I just want to be next to him again and have his arms around me again ‚Ä¶ and everything else and morning sex, oh god I miss our morning fucks! I never wanted to make someone their morning coffee before him. I never wanted to wake a man up with a blow job before him. 

It's fuckin weird. And dumb.
