I confront her and ask her why she said she was at home and why she got a second coffee right after I got her one. Her response was that it's uncomfortable that I'm insecure in the relationship and that she's never had to explain to anyone else where she's been or what's she's been doing before.

How are we staying awake?

I used to be a decorated barista and drinking 300-500mg of caffeine a day no problem! But then I switched off of it pretty much cold turkey 7 years ago. Starting 3 years ago I would drink 2-3 inches of dark roast coffee (the more you roast it the less caffeine) every morning with my last family. Now, I’ll have a cup of coffee here or there 1-2x a week and a cortado or cappuccino maybe once a week (usually on the weekends as a treat, not for work). Averaging maybe 200mg of caffeine in a WEEK.


On exceptionally rough days, I’ll grab the smallest redbull and it helps a LOT! but I can’t handle any other energy drinks, especially the sugar free ones; they really wreck my gut and make my head feel “buzzy” in a bad way and sometimes give me headaches within 30 minutes.

Anyone else super sensitive to artificial sweeteners? Stevia doesn’t really mess with me, but I can almost always taste it and I really don’t like it. Sucralose is in what feels like everything now and while it’s not supposed to be much different, it definitely gives me a headache.

Mostly, I’m just wondering if you’re naturally peppy. Maybe you’re Celsius and Alani freaks like my 9-5 corporate friends. Are you getting what you need out of a good old fashioned cup of joe in the morning?

It’s been 2-3 months since I dropped that letter off to you, and you still cross my mind. Even though we never officially made out on a date we spoke for 6 months, I thought you’d reach out and apologize or try to explain, you have my number I never blocked you, you know I have a Facebook that I unfollowed you on but didn’t block, and you have my address, but so far you have shown no effort, leading me to believe you never really cared. I was willing to change my world for you, I was fully committed blinding myself from what close friends were telling me and what your actions were showing me. All of the missed dates/meets all of the excuses and circumstances, they all fell into place when I found out you were seeing this other guy for the past year.

I don’t know what I was to you, but to me I saw a partner. Someone who wasn’t afraid to share their secrets with me, to make sure we had a solid beginning a good foundation to build something solid on, the hard part is that the secrets were more likely to break whatever we had, but you were honest with them strengthening my trust. You could’ve told me you were in a relationship, but weren’t sure it was going to workout or not, and I would’ve waited and respected it, trusting you more. But because I found out not by your honesty, but by social media, after we had talked about going on dates, setting up a couple of failed dates, and moving on from our pasts. The cut was too deep, to much trust broke, and to many conversations to question.

Part of me wishes I never found out, especially by accident. But I’m glad I did, because I am moving an hour away in a few months more than likely, which you knew, and I don’t think I could take dealing with this kinda thing on top of life. 

I don’t hold any ill will towards you, on the contrary, I hope you thrive and have a beautiful and happy life. I am sad that it’s not with me but that is life for you, and it usually isn’t fair to me lol I wasn’t lying when in the letter I said “I hope you find peace and happiness.” I’ll always have a spot for you in my heart because you showed me more of me that I thought had passed on a long time ago. I feel I’ll always miss you, but can never be with you.

Room temperature drinks are almost as bad.

I'm a 29-year-old guy, like, totally an INTJ, you know? As you probably know what that means. I asked this girl out – she's also an INTJ. We met online and haven't actually met up in person yet. We've been texting for a solid week, but she's not really that active, to be honest. Anyway, I invited her to a Bach and Vivaldi concert. I'm paying for the whole thing, and the tickets weren't super expensive, but I haven't gotten paid yet, haha. I'm also a Capricorn, so making that first connection with people can be a bit tough for me if it is not for work. But I'm working on it, trying to be more outgoing and show I'm interested. I mean, everyone wants to find someone cool, right? This girl's 25, a Gemini, and you'd think she'd be pretty easygoing and chatty because of her sign, but maybe it's the INTJ thing, 'cause she's putting in zero effort. I'm carrying the entire conversation. I'm trying to play it smart: not being pushy, giving her space, not bugging her, but trying to get her involved. I get a question or two back, but that's about it OR even nothing, and it's kind of killing my enthusiasm and ruins all vibe of convo.

Well... We've got this concert tomorrow, but I suggested grabbing coffee beforehand to actually meet face-to-face. She's still acting pretty dull. One-word answers, seriously. I was thinking about just canceling the whole thing and getting my ticket money back, but they're non-refundable, damn it. Considered bringing a friend of mine, but he's working and can't make it. Feels like I'm past the point of no return. I could just bail and eat the cost of the tickets, but I've already spent nerves, cash, and most importantly, time on her and this whole plan. I'm not asking for much, just some interest back. It's kinda sad. Even when I suggested coffee, she was like, ""I'll text you tomorrow around lunchtime about it,"" after I offered to pick her up in a taxi or just meet there, at coffee shop.

I admit, I even threw out the idea of an aquarium at first, so the plan was aquarium, coffee, then the concert. But seeing how little she's trying, I'm definitely not dropping more money on the aquarium proposing that we can go there for our second date. I played it cool and being gentleman. She was okay with it, like... literally all I received is an ""ok"" message. Even if it is my fuck up but the only one.

Plus, we even seem to like the same stuff: movies, anime, manga, books, museums, theaters, shows, that kind of thing. I just don't want tomorrow to be a disaster, and I'm already telling myself I'm gonna enjoy the night for myself, have some good coffee and music. But I can't shake this feeling that something's off. I haven't even properly seen what she looks like! I didn't ask for it but it could be a nice gesture, right? Her profile's just a list of interests, a picture of a MacBook Air, some sushi, and Spirited Away on the screen. She's seen my pic on my profile. I don't think I'm ugly, I'm in decent shape, and I'm polite and chill when we talk, but all I get for my jokes are those laughing emojis. What the heck is going on here? I am not asking much, just some interest towards me. I understand that people are different and I cannot prejudice but is it too much I ask?

I've talked to all sorts of people with different MBTI types before, but this Gemini-INTJ combo is a first for me. Honestly, I don't run into INTJs much in general. Is this some kind of joke? Is it really this hard to click with other INTJs? I know this might not be the right place to ask, but this was the first place I thought of to get some advice. I would greatly appreciate if you could share your thoughts on it.


TL;DR: I met a girl online, but she is super passive and doesn't talk much. I tried to light a spark of interest in her, but she seems unwilling. We have a date tomorrow and the whole situation is frustrating me",1,1743890221.0,intj,6,1.0,False

[Reflection in mirror](https://preview.redd.it/src0v25693te1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2765d2fac21fbc48c43650898c5aa6c669cd6b8f)



Please, I kindly ask that you leave a like on each video, even if you don't want to subscribe to the channel. Also if possible consider following me on X: [https://x.com/DevWithCoffee](https://x.com/DevWithCoffee)

**Part 1:** [https://youtu.be/JwG99oIZ6YE](https://youtu.be/JwG99oIZ6YE)

In this first part you will be able to learn the logic of the calculation used, with this you will be able to create your own reflection system, even if it is in water or in other types of mirrors or even a player shadow system.

**Part 2:** [https://youtu.be/JwG99oIZ6YE](https://youtu.be/JwG99oIZ6YE)

Now comes the important part, where I show you how to make the reflection move smoothly and almost in sync with the player.

**Part 3:** [https://youtu.be/MXV90-vRppw](https://youtu.be/MXV90-vRppw)

This is an additional tutorial just to explain how to convert the sprite graphic so that it actually looks like a reflection, since the two sides of the sprites are not always the same. Considered hair, accessories on one of the hands or on one arm, color of clothes, etc.

**Part 4:** [https://youtu.be/eMuMGpxvGVA](https://youtu.be/eMuMGpxvGVA)

Although the system has been working well since the second part, some care is needed with the upper limit of the map if the reflection is in a tall mirror. The numbers on the sides indicate the distance the player can walk before the reflection locks onto the upper part. So these are practical tests to understand how it works.

**Part 5:** [https://youtu.be/crCYn0JIr8E](https://youtu.be/crCYn0JIr8E)

This is my favorite part of the tutorial: how to include reflection for NPCs that have movement. However, because it uses **Common Events** as auxiliary functions, this method only works with Rm2k3 1.12a and no previous edition or version.

1jsepcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jsepcv/overwhelmed_by_eatingfood_in_general/,Overwhelmed by eating/food in general,"I was diagnosed with ADHD October 2024, and am still on the journey of finding medication/dosage that works. I am on 50 mg of Vyvanse rn, which seems to be working okay. 

One of my biggest symptoms and struggles with ADHD has been feeding myself. I know I have been using food as a source of dopamine since I was a teenager, but it really spiraled when I moved out to live on my own in the fall of 2019. I thought I just was picky, had an eating disorder, was lazy, or any number of other excuses. 

The thought of thinking about what to eat, knowing what I have in the fridge/pantry, gathering ingredients, preparing the food, etc etc etc makes me feel paralyzed, until I realize its 3pm and I've only had a coffee all day. This usually leads to just ordering something I know I like and will be the same every time, and then I feel IMMENSE guilt for 1. wasting money and 2. being 'lazy'. I am trying to be kinder to myself, and set myself up for success, like packing lunches, making meal plans, and grocery shopping smarter/more often, but I still feel so stuck.

My lovely fiance is a chef, and he understands and tries to empathize with my struggles with food, but its not his job to feed me like a toddler, and cook/prepare every meal every day after he has spent the entirety of HIS workday cooking. He graciously cooks dinners, and we plan the week every Sunday, but I am still stuck with feeling paralyzed at breakfast/lunch, or if hes working later and I'm on my own for dinner. Every 'solution' I think of only lasts a week at most, and I know the lack of nutrients/consistent energy is making my ADHD feel worse. 

Am I subconciously doing it on purpose because I know if I wait long enough I'll just eat out? Am I honestly just lazy and don't like cooking? It's getting harder and harder to stay kind and forgiving to myself when it feels like I just have no discipline. 

As I am writing this post, it is the late afternoon, I have spent the whole day studying, and I feel exhausted and burnt out because I haven't been taking care of myself. I don't have the mental OR physical energy to even think about making food, so I ordered take out AGAIN. 

I just feel so frustrated and lonely with these issues. If anyone has similar struggles I would love to hear some strategies/ coping methods. I apologize for the novel haha. Thanks for reading this far <3",1,1743890005.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I don’t know what I said but the last thing I heard was he wanted to call the hospital. I had the feeling I was on acid.. I feel trillings, shakings.

my mother tongue is not English but I hope someone knows what this is.

I have it for almost 6 weeks now when I go to bed. it get’s worse with alcohol, valeriaan, coffee.. I had one period in my sleep I started screaming super loud. I have the feeling it damaged my nerve system. I went to the neurologist in the hospital but they don’t know what I have… 11 professionals are on my case but no one gave me answers yet.

so what I know is that antibiotics do get rid of bad bacteria but also good ones. and your gut is connected with your brain, that’s also why I am doing my best with eating a lot of probiotica now.

because I was reading some article about older man who experienced the same and had some psychotic episode as well.

does anyone know something about this?? my psychiatrist want to send me to early psychose department but I don’t feel like I am crazy, only a lot of stuff in my body are not going well. she adviced me to start with olanzipine. I hope someone knows more about all of this..

Things started off great the honeymoon phase was fun, we spent quality time together, and I was genuinely happy. But as time went on, she started becoming really controlling. She wants constant attention, doubts my loyalty all the time, and gets upset if I don’t text back immediately even if I’m studying, with family, or busy with something important.

She doesn’t like me hanging out with friends even my guy friends. I’ve had to ask for “permission” to go out anywhere. And if I forget to text her while I’m out or busy, she gets mad, even though I try to keep her updated as much as I can. It’s just not always possible.

I’ve made a lot of sacrifices like I stopped going out with my friends often, and even blocked my only girl best friend just because K didn’t like her. And for context I’ve been in relationships before. I messed up in my last one by cheating. It wasn’t something planned, I was just immature. I owned up to it, told my ex, and broke things off. Since then, I’ve been in therapy, on meds for some stuff. By the time I met K, I was in a much better place, and I told her everything upfront before we even got into a relationship.

I’ve tried really hard to show her that I love her and that she can trust me, but nothing seems to be enough. We go to the same college she’s a senior, and I’m a year below her. She never wanted me to have friends there either, but I still made a few because I need to survive college too. Meanwhile, she’s got her own group of besties, and I’ve hung out with them a few times. What really pissed me off was when her friends would randomly show her guys in college and ask her “how does he look?” right in front of me.And if I ever did something like that, I know I’d be in deep shit. But I let it go because I always try to avoid arguments. Most of the time, I’m the one who ends up apologizing even when I didn’t do anything.

One particular thing that still messes with my head was during our college fest. I spent an hour with her, then told her my friends were calling me and I’d be back in a few minutes. I went, spent like 15-20 mins with them, came back, and she just started ignoring me. I stood there trying to talk to her while she laughed and gossiped with her bestie, completely acting like I wasn’t even there. Her bestie looked at me and laughed, saying “she’s mad at you, maanale isko.” I went and got her a cold coffee and came back still the same. I felt like a complete idiot, especially since there were people I knew around. I left and spent time with my friends instead. Even then, I bought her a couple of gifts from the stalls and kept them with me.

Later, when everything was over, I went to her and said “let’s go,” and she just ignored me again and walked to the college gate. When I got there, she hit me with “we’re done.” I was like “what the hell did I do?” Her bestie even rolled her eyes at me. Eventually, we talked, but she played the victim, cried and again, I apologized. Gave her the gifts, dropped her home, and tried to move on.

The thing is I’ve been completely loyal in this relationship. Haven’t flirted, haven’t even looked at girls the wrong way. But I still get treated like I’m some kind of villain. And now, I’ve started feeling really disconnected from her. I still care, but it’s not the same.

I’ve always prioritized her mental health and been there for her when she needed me. But when it’s about mine, she doesn’t really care much. I remember one day I told her I was having a shitty day and she literally said, “kb accha jaata hai tera dinn.” That stuck with me. Since then, I’ve talked less about how I feel. But later when something comes up, she hits me with “why didn’t you tell me earlier?” but she never actually apologizes for those moments either.

I honestly don’t know if this is normal or toxic. I don’t have the guts to break up because I feel like it’ll be messy. She does love me, and I’m her first boyfriend so I know it might mess her up. But this behavior isn’t okay and she refuses to see it or change

Would really appreciate any advice or thoughts from people who’ve been through something similar. Also, if I missed anything or you think there’s something I should add, let me know my brain’s all foggy writing this lol",2,1743888849.0,RelationshipIndia,3,1.0,False
1jseaau,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1jseaau/the_maga_crowd_doesnt_realize_just_how_stupid/,"The MAGA crowd doesn't realize just how stupid Trump's tariffs are, they're not only stupid they're handsdown the most stupid economic decision ever, in all of US history","I really feel MAGA people have no idea just how incredibly stupid Trump's tariffs really are. They're not just stupid, they are quite likely the most destructive economic decision ever made in American history.

Like 200 years ago tariffs weren't a bad idea, because the world was a very different place back then. The US was largely economically self-sufficient. And so 200 years ago, while the US had significant tariffs on exports, those were imposed largely on luxury goods and finished goods like furniture, porcelain, tea, alcohol etc., often goods that were imported by upper class and wealthier people who could afford it. And the US back then was an emerging economy, that for the most part was self-sufficient.

Today the global economy is vastly different. The entire global economy is extremely interconnected. And that means tariffs are gonna be imposed on key production inputs like oil, natural resouces, critical minerals, key components like semiconductors, batteries, electronics etc. Pretty much EVERYTHING is gonna become more expensive. And while in the 19th century tariffs were primarily paid by those who were already financially well-off, today tariffs will be paid mostly by the lower and the middle class.

And while on one hand this will massively increase prices for the masses on the other hand it will also devastate American export businesses. Like if other countries like China or the EU retaliate and now your exports are suddenly 20-30% more expensive, many US export businesses will either struggle extremely or in the worst case go bust because they simply cannot compete anymore.

Plus, the concpet of comparative advantage is extremely crucial in the 21st century. No country in today's  world can ever be hyper-efficient while trying to do everything at once. The US is specialized in certain key sectors like IT, software, financial services, retail, e-commerce, weapons manufacturing, aerospace etc. But the US simply cannot remain hyper-efficient in all of those sectors but at the same time become hyper-efficient in mining, textile production, semiconductors, low-level manufacturing, production of coffee, chocolate, tea, furniture etc. etc.

See, the whole reason why the US is an extremely wealthy country is that the US has set up extremely interconnected supply chains around the world, utilizing the comparative advantages other countries have to offer, while focusing on its own core sectors. So what Trump is doing is basically undo all of that. It's gonna make everything more expensive, US exporters are gonna get absolutely hammered, and many may even go completely under. And the US economy will become a lot less efficient, because even a country like the US simply cannot be hyper-efficient at everything at the same time.

I don't think the MAGA crowd has even the slightest idea of the extreme gravity of this. What Trump is doing is probably handsdown the most consequential economic decision in US history. This may very well be the beginning of the end of the US as a global economic superpower, and could absolutely crash the economy in ways people can't even imagine.",1,1743888831.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,19,0.51,False

Nina knelt on the floor, sobbing and begging the Alpha of the Rivera pack, her mate, to show mercy.

“They’re just pups,” she pleaded, her voice breaking. “It’s dark down there, and they’ll be terrified. I’m their mother. Please punish me instead...”

But Kyle, the Alpha, looked down at her coldly, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. Paige stood by his side, her arms crossed, her gaze smug.

“This is what happens when you spoil them,” Kyle said, his voice low and commanding, laced with the Alpha tone that made Nina’s knees weaken. “They need discipline, and as their father and your Alpha, it’s my right to teach them.”

The pups, hungry and desperate in the basement, somehow found a bag of trail mix left behind from a pack gathering.

That night, both pups suffered a severe allergic reaction and were rushed to the hospital. Meanwhile, Paige celebrated her pregnancy on social media, her post flaunting her relationship with the Alpha.

When Amaya Dean, Kyle’s sister and a loyal member of the Rivera pack, arrived at the hospital, she found Nina collapsed outside the emergency room, her face pale and streaked with tears.

“Please, Amaya,” Nina whispered, her voice trembling. “I don’t want anything else. I just want my pups to be okay.”

The lights in the emergency room stayed on, while Nina felt as if her heart was being torn apart, leaving her breathless with pain. Amaya’s eyes filled with compassion as she knelt beside her sister-in-law.

“Don’t say that,” Amaya said softly, her voice steady despite the tears in her eyes. “The pups’ safety is what matters most. Once they’re stable, I’ll make sure Alpha gets an earful from me...”

Before she could finish speaking, Nina handed her phone to Amaya with trembling hands.

Paige had just posted online half an hour ago.

""""You are the pup we’ve always hoped for. We will love you forever,"""" read the caption, alongside an ultrasound showing she was six weeks pregnant.

Amaya’s voice faltered, and after a moment, she spoke again, hesitantly.

“I’ll call Alpha right away. Don’t worry, Luna. You are the only Luna recognized by the Rivera pack...”

This time, Nina directly dialed Kyle’s number. As soon as she put it on speaker, his impatient voice came through, sharp and dismissive.

“Are you going to tell me the pups are in critical condition again? I only locked them up for a day. How could it lead to this? Isn’t this just another excuse, Nina? You make me sick!”

Before she could say a word, Kyle hung up the phone abruptly.

Amaya turned pale, unsure how to console her sister-in-law.

Tears fell from Nina’s eyes like rain, her hands clutching the edge of the hospital bench.

“Amaya, I have nothing left. My pups are all I have. Please, let us go...”

Just as Amaya was about to respond, the light in the emergency room went out. Nina scrambled to her feet and rushed to the doctor, who only shook his head, his expression grim.

“They suffered from severe nut allergies, leading to laryngeal swelling. They were in critical condition for too long before they arrived.”

“We did everything we could. I’m so sorry for your loss.”

As he spoke, two small beds were rolled out from the emergency room, each covered with a white sheet.

Nina couldn’t support herself any longer and collapsed to the floor, her sobs echoing through the sterile hallway.

Amaya called the pack’s funeral home to handle the arrangements, while Nina followed her like a shadow, her movements slow and lifeless.

When the bodies were lifted onto the funeral home’s vehicle, realization struck Nina. She rushed to the vehicle and clung desperately to the door, refusing to let them leave.

“My pups aren’t gone! Where are you taking them? Give my pups back!”

“No, no, no! Let go of my pups. I want to take them home!”

Amaya embraced her tightly, shouting through her own tears.

“It’s okay, Nina. It’s okay. I know you’re hurting. It’s going to be okay...”

With several pack members pulling her away, the moment her grip loosened from the door, the funeral vehicle drove off.

As the vehicle disappeared into the distance, Nina finally collapsed, losing consciousness.

When she awoke, she was back at the Rivera pack’s mansion. Amaya sat by her bedside, her eyes swollen from crying. Upon seeing Nina awake, Amaya quickly wiped her tears.

“Nina, you’re awake. Do you want some coffee? Are you hungry...”

Nina forced a smile, but tears slipped down her cheeks.

“Amaya, please, let me go. I have nothing left now...”""",4,1743888691.0,romancenovels,4,1.0,False

*It isn’t— well, I guess it isn’t even proper grammar, really. The two exclamation points. Should be just one. Or maybe three of them but not two. Or is it incorrect grammar? Informal maybe—* 

Tom’s thought is interrupted by the sound of a new email. With two clicks, the window glides open. 

**Subject: Upcoming Performance Reviews & Office Tidiness**
**Dear Team,**
**As we enter the second quarter, a reminder that performance reviews are scheduled for next week. Please refer to the attached document below for details on expectations.**

**Additionally, while we allow a touch of personality in your workspace, please be mindful of maintaining a clean and professional environment. A clutter-free desk helps keep the office organized and professional.**

**Thank you,**
**Greg**
*Operations Coordinator*

Tom clicks out. His eyes drift back to the card. He slides it out and flips it over. His fingers trace the edge, noting the $3.99 price tag. He folds it open and reads the inscription once more. 

His gaze hovers above the cubical, eyeing coworkers. They walk back and forth, making journeys to the printer and restroom. 
Sliding out of his chair, Tom works his way to the break room. The coffee is almost empty, but he pours some into a styrofoam cup anyway. It’s burnt and metallic. 

Tom opens his phone, floating his finger over potential apps. Aimlessly, he clicks on Facebook. The little bell icon is lit up with six notifications. He clicks on them. It’s mutual friends wishing him a happy birthday. 

Happy Birthday! (From Becky Dalton) 
happy birthday (From Craig Johnston) 
46! Happy Birthday, old fart ;) (From Jamie Chambers) 

	
The remaining notifications are from two expired friend requests, sent several months ago. Tom ignores them and quickly likes the birthday wishes. He clicks off his phone, walks back to his cubicle, and puts the phone face down on his desk. It’s parallel with the birthday card. He eyes it one last time. 

*Happy Birthday, Tom!!*

——— 

The stagnant heat of the bar swallows Tom. A pair of older gentlemen sit at one corner, throwing back handfuls of stale peanuts. The shell scraps are thrown into a repurposed glass ashtray. 

Tom picks the opposite end of the bar and sits on a red stool with cracking vinyl, yellowed foam sticking out beneath. He eyes a piece of paper, taped crookedly on the wall behind the bar: 

**YES, WE KNOW IT’S HOT. THE A/C IS STILL OUT. WE’RE WORKING ON IT.**

A tiny, metallic fan oscillates a few feet from Tom, blowing air on him every couple seconds. He orders a beer, maybe two. Three is pushing his limit and four is when he starts getting fucked up. Better stick to two—still in a fine place to drive home. 

Deciding against food, Tom cracks a few peanuts. He chews down the dryness and washes it down with the lukewarm beer. He puts his phone on the sticky bar top and brings out the birthday card from his back pocket. The card hits the counter as his attention wanders to the TV overhead, playing a muted golf tournament. Tom takes a sip of his beer and sits the glass on top of the white birthday envelope, watching the condensation form a damp ring around his handwritten name. 

**TOM**

With a final swig, the empty glass clicks against the counter. Tom picks up his soggy birthday card, stuffs it back into his pocket, and walks from the bar. The evening sun hits his face as he opens the front door. 

——— 

Tom rips off the tearable cardboard top from the box and throws the black plastic container into the microwave. He eyes down the packaging. Banquet, Salisbury Steak Meal. He flips the box over and reads:

*Slit the film to vent–*

*SHIT!* 

Tom pulls open the microwave and takes a knife, cutting short slices through the thin plastic. The knife goes too far and dips into the slimy brown gravy beneath. Wiping off the knife, Tom pops the container back into the microwave and nukes it. Mashed Potatoes made with REAL CREAM the package reads. 

The TV powers up right as the microwave starts beeping. Tom’s fork stabs nicely into the rubber steak, and he dips it into the mashed potatoes. Setting the fork down, Tom surfs through the TV guide, deciding on reruns of Family Feud. Just as he settles into his recliner, the episode goes straight to commercial. Taking this as a sign, Tom begins to dive into his dinner. 

Just as the final bits of gravy are mopped up with the potatoes, Tom tosses the container to the side and sinks into his recliner. He lifts his half-finished Pepsi can and takes a swig. As Tom—snap! The back of the recliner gives way, dropping Tom flat. The Pepsi spills onto the bottom of his crème-colored work shirt, making a brown splotch across his stomach. 

“Fuck me,” Tom mutters to himself. He pulls himself up and grabs a handful of paper towels. Returning to the living room, he dabs the soda. He pulls off the work shirt and goes to his closet, reaching for the nearest option. He puts on comfy, oversized graphic t-shirt, which reads: 
**I’m not saying I’m Superman, but have you ever seen us in the same room?** 

He returns to the living room, kneeling behind the recliner. He inspects the damage. The commercial on TV blares louder—a local ad shouting over the static. Tom turns the volume down and resumes work. Slowly, the commercial catches his attention. 

“Come on down to Rocket Randy’s Firework Depot! We have the biggest, most-glorious, most-flashy, state-of-the-art fireworks in the tri-state area! These are guaranteed to not break the bank, in fact—” 

Stopping his task, Tom brings his attention to the screen. There’s a shirtless overweight man screaming in front of an American flag. He has two sparklers in his hands, waving them around, screaming about discount prices. The overweight man continues. 

“WE GOT DRAGON’S BREATH! THE LIGHTNING STRIKE! AND THE BIGGEST, MOST-BADDEST…” 

At this point, the man is getting red in the chest, veins popping around his neck. 

“...THE GREATEST FIREWORK OF ALL TIME: THE SMOULDERING GIANT!” 

At this revelation, the screaming man dives into the flag behind him as the sound stage flashes briefly, crumbling around him. The screen blinks the address and phone number on screen. 

Half-aware, Tom slams one final time into the back of his recliner, which then promptly snaps back into place. He eyes the chair, feeling satisfied, and stands up. Tom grabs his cigarettes off the kitchen counter, pulls one out, and ignites his lighter. Thinking better, he snuffs the flame and steps outside. 

The plastic patio chair wobbles as Tom slumps down. He watches the last minutes of sun slip below the horizon. Taking a drag, he giggles to himself. 

“Fuckin’ Rocket Randy,” Tom murmurs. 
He stubs out the cigarette, grabs his keys. 

——— 

Rocket Randy’s Firework Depot is set up under a massive white tent. A towering floodlight, mounted to a rusted metal pole, casts harsh shadows across the stretched-white canvas, illuminating the darkened gravel lot. Swarms of bugs bounce around its glow. Patches of dirt cake the bottom edges. The entrance is two tent slits, stirring in the summer wind. 

“Still open?” Tom asks, stepping inside. He recognizes the man from the commercial. 
“Always,” the man replies. Except, he doesn’t look like a defunct Uncle Sam. 

He’s an overweight balding man, with white wisps of hair holding onto his receding bald head. His sunburnt shoulders bulge out of his stretched tank top. He’s sitting in a small white chair, uneven from the gravel floor. A small orange plastic fan blows next to him, moving around the sticky night air. 

Tom is the only customer. He eyes a jumbled collection of mismatched shopping carts in the corner. He walks over, grabs the closest one with four working wheels, and drags it across the gravel. The fireworks are sorted on sturdy wooden pallets. 

Rocket Randy gets up and walks over to Tom. He swipes the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief. 

“Know what ‘yer getting?” Randy asks, slapping a firework box. 
Tom shrugs. “I just want big ones. Lots of them.” 
Randy grins. “Big ones, we got. Let me take you over here.” 

The shopping cart squeaks over the gravel. With a shove, Tom follows Randy to a different corner. A massive square box reading DARTING DEVILS makes its way into Tom’s cart. 

“These’ll last you a while. They shoot all around like this,” Randy says, using his two index fingers to wave around in different directions. “I’ve got more if you’d like.” 
Tom nods. “I wanna fill up the cart.” 
“Good man.” 

The cart quickly fills up. Tom grabs mortars, roman candles, comets, rockets, smoke bombs and M-80s. Randy helps him, throwing in fountains, handfuls of sparklers, firecrackers, poppers, multi-shots, and ground spinners. 

At the very end, Randy walks away for a moment, turning a corner so Tom can’t see him. He hears Randy grunt. Finally, he returns with a green and purple container. Tom is already familiar with it. How could he not be? It is, after all, the greatest firework of all time: The Smoldering Giant. 

“Put it right on top,” Tom says, pointing to the pile in front of him. 
“My God,” Randy wheezes. He slams the giant on the mountain of fireworks. “You must be havin’ you a helluva Fourth of July show.” 
Tom shakes his head. “No, not for me. I think I’m ready to get these to go.” 
Randy eyes him. “Alright, well…follow me along here.” 

They drag the cart to the register. 
“Gotta ask,” Randy leans in. “What’re you doin’ with all these?” 
Tom shrugs. “I guess I just wanna see them shoot off.” 
Randy flashes a toothless grin. “Hell, son. I respect that.” 

Tom smiles, pulling out his wallet. 
“What’s the damage?” 
“Well,” Randy says. “No use in counting out all these one by one. I’ll give you a bundled price for all of ‘em.” 
Tom nods. 
Randy starts figuring it out in his head. “For the lot, it’ll be…” 

——— 

The shopping cart lugs along the empty parking lot. Passing his own car, Tom continues down the road, swerving onto the sidewalk. The mound of fireworks shake as he travels down the pavement. A few hundred feet down the sidewalk, Tom notices an opening in the forest. A rusted bridge peaks through the trees. 

Carefully, Tom wheels the cart down into the clearing and pushes it into the woods. Quickly, he is greeted by the rusted bridge. The bridge, long forgotten by the city and left to rust, has remnants of a derelict train track. The railing, waist-high and warped, creaks as Tom parks the heavy cart. A flowing river snakes below the underpass, its surface reflecting the distant amber streetlight as it curves towards the freeway. Above, steel beams arc across, now faded by rain, flaking its corroded orange skin. It bears faded graffiti—names, slurs, and unreadable symbols. One of the only spray-painted messages remains, stark and haunting—DREAM BIG. 

The moving city echoes beyond the trees, distant and detached. A police siren reverberates across, fading into the warm night with noise of traffic. 

	
Slowly, Tom moves The Smoldering Giant out of the cart and places it on the ground. He pulls some of the fireworks from the cart. He takes the giant and puts it directly in the middle of the cart, curling out its fuse and extending it as far as it can go. It sticks out between the holes of the shopping cart. Next, Tom takes the remaining fireworks and places them on top of the giant, making sure they are all packed in tight. 

	
He tugs onto The Smoldering Giant’s fuse one final time as it sways in the wind, touching the underside of the cart. Tom reaches into his back pocket for his lighter, then feels the soggy, wet rectangle. 

*Happy Birthday Tom!!* 

Tom grabs the card from his back pocket and stares. The condensation ring has now faded, leaving dry wavy paper in its place. He takes the card and wedges it directly on top of the firework pile. His handwritten name can still be seen sticking up. With a final push of his palm, he shoves the card deeper into the pile. Finally, he locates his lighter and ignites it, waving it under The Smouldering Giant’s fuse. It catches. A hiss. 

Tom sprints away from the cart, away from the bridge, away from the clearing. 

Jumping behind a massive oak and turning, he nearly misses the explosion. The first rocket blows instantly. A brilliant flash of blue before the rest goes with it. It’s hardly a second before Tom can make out the cart tipping over—then, eruption. 

Off, in all directions, an exploding mixture of color. Screaming shots whistle into the air and spiral out. Erratic cracks ring throughout the forest. The blast expands, creating a blinding burst of yellow and orange. It multiplies upon itself, enveloping the sides of the bridge. Each boom more thundering than the last. The river below illuminates into a dazzling reflection of color. 

The smoke turns thick, layering the sparks. Red and gold shoots from the bridge, whizzing into trees. Debris and ash are flying, which send smouldering pieces airborne. 

The smoke builds. The explosion calming. A few more pops. A flash of purple darts across the sky. A hum in the air—then silence. 

The smoke fades into the sky. It loosens, then clears. The shopping cart is toppled over and destroyed—half-melted and glowing. 

	
Tom stands, heart pounding in his chest and ears ringing. His face is lit by the last dying embers, red-orange. Smoke loops away. Silence grows, and the city’s hum returns. 

A blackened cardboard tube, moving silently by the bridge’s edge, is taken by the breeze. It descends into the river below. The current grabs it, flowing into black water.

1jsdxkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1jsdxkl/have_you_ever_played_white_wolf/,Have you ever played White Wolf?,"(NoSleep took my post down bc I had full names of fictional characters in my story, essentially doxxing my imagination. Whoopsies. Please enjoy)

The neighbors taught us the game. Well, I can’t really say neighbors, they lived a full block away from us. But Terry and I were In the same grade at school, and my parents were close with his. The Kenties had ten kids. Most of them were older than us, one was even married with his own kid. My sister and I were sent over to their house every summer, warm weekend, or free day while my parents were at work. This had been the system ever since I turned thirteen. 

One summer, Mom had just started her new training at the hospital, so for a few months, she’d work night shifts for a week or so before switching back. We’d head over after ten, when mom went to bed after her night shift, and then we’d come back by to get the food she’d left us in the fridge for lunch before going back over. It was weird, and she apologized all the time for it, but I’d say we were pretty mature kids all things considered.

Charlotte and I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with them. Sure they were competitive and a little nuts sometimes, but we were too. I’d go as far as saying I grew up part Kentie. I didn’t mind spending hours with them because none of us ever grew tired or bitter with each other. Their house was very welcoming. That and they also had a Playstation. And RipStix. And an untapped imagination when it came to going to the park or fucking around at the splash pad or finding where the plows shoved the parking lot snow into massive peaks of ice.

I remember now how often Terrence Kentie’s imagination should have gotten us killed. Races at breakneck speed down the alleyway connecting our houses together, the time we got chased by a dog and having to jump a fence, barely escaping with our asses, makeshift boat competitions on a quiet lake. All of them had that kid-like reasoning on why it was the greatest idea ever. 

That’s why, when Terry mentioned White Wolf while we were at the park by my house one summer evening, I was surprised he’d never mentioned it before. We’d played every game I’d thought possible in our years of hanging out at the Kenties.

“You’ve never heard of it?”

“No, I don’t think so.”

“We play it all the time!! At my uncle’s camp, it’s like, all the cousins do.”

“Really?”

“Yeah! It’s better in the summertime, when it’s warmer at night.”

The game was to be played at dusk, or while the sun was setting. You didn’t need a lot of people, but the more there were, the better.  

“Basically, you pick a base.” Terry looked around before pointing to one of the old wooden picnic tables. “Like that. Something kind of big, or at least easy to like, see.”

Grace, one of his older sisters a few years older than us, chimed in.

“There’s a stump at Uncle Anthony’s camp. That’s what we use most times.” 

“Yeah, yeah! So, what you do is-”

“You choose someone who’s “it”. They’re the wh-” Carrie, another Kentie sister interrupted.

“Shut up! I’m telling it!”

“Jeez, okay.” 

“Whatever, yeah, they’re the White Wolf. Everyone else hides while they count.”

“We go to like-” Grace started.

“100!” shouted Lewis, the second youngest.

“Or 500 by fives.” 

“It’s the same thiiing.” 

“Stop it!!” Terry hollered. “ANYway, they count and everyone hides. When they’re done, the wolf seeks everyone else. If the wolf gets too close to someone’s hiding spot, the hider ye-”

The other Kentie kids all screamed at the same time, making me and Charlotte jump a little.

“WHITE WOLF!!”

“Guys!! Come ON!!” Terry covered his hands with his eyes. That made us all laugh.

According to Terry, a bit begrudgingly, once someone alerts the others of the wolf, everyone has to run and touch the base, before the wolf gets you. 

“So, if they tag you, are you the next wolf?”

“No. If the wolf gets you, you’re *dead*!” Lewis made a quick slicing motion across his neck to punctuate the severity of this. 

After a few minutes of arguing over how to choose the wolf, Grace picked some of the tall, grassy weeds by the fence. She counted out six, then ripped off the ends to make them even, all except for one. She shuffled them up in her hands and we all picked one. I got the shortest stalk, so I was the wolf. I turned and faced the parking lot of the park, making a show of covering my eyes so no one would accuse me of cheating. 

I counted to 100, and shouted

“Ready or not, here I come!”

I guess it was out of habit, and I felt kind of silly. But when I turned around and saw the silent park, I felt excitement bubble in my chest. Crickets were singing in the baseball field next to me, but even the breeze felt quieter. I took a step forward and looked for a shoe poking out of a slide, or movement by the trees. The gravel ground cover crunched noisily under my feet, but otherwise, I would have been silent. 

I stepped up onto the playground’s first platform, creeping over the tunnels that led to the monkey bars. No one in sight yet. I swung across them, dropping noiselessly onto the next part of the playground. 

Then I saw it. Lewis’s hand on the inside of the next slide. He was bracing himself inside of it, but at the angle I had landed, I could just barely make it out. The dying light wasn’t helping, but my eyes were getting used to it. 

I stood up, slowly. I moved over the short bridge leading to the slide’s entrance like a ninja. 

I peeked over the corner and Lewis’ eyes met mine. 

“WHITE WOLF!” He screamed, sliding down the rest of the slide as my hand swiped in the empty space where he had been seconds ago. 

The park erupted in sound. Carrie dropped from a tree. Terry sprinted out from a porta potty. Grace scooped up Lewis as she ran past him. Charlotte ran out of the dugout. All the movement came so fast I almost forgot what I was supposed to do.

I shot down the slide, in hot pursuit of Carrie, who had been the furthest from the base in her tree. She laughed and jogged easily out of range of my shorter legs. I watched her make it to the table with everyone else, along with time to spare. Flopping to the ground in defeat, I rolled onto my back as we all laughed and gasped for air.

After I had caught my breath, I realized something.

“Hey, I didn’t catch anyone. What happens now?”

Terry sat next to me. “Well, you have to hunt again. Let’s see if you have better luck this time.”

A noise sounded from the direction of my house, causing my sister and I to whip our heads around. It was Dad’s whistle. 

“Darn. Okay! *Next time*, we’ll play this more next time!” I shouted over my shoulder. 

Years passed. We moved away from Kentie after Mom was offered a better position at a bigger hospital a state over. Charlotte and I grew up, graduated, moved out. She went to medical school, like mom. That wasn’t my vibe. I graduated from Boise State University, went to grad school for a few long years, and eventually landed a job at one of the local high schools teaching American History. I met my wife, we got married, I lived.

I had all but forgotten about the Kenties, sans the few times I would recall a funny phrase Lewis said, or a night of secretive gaming with Terry. It wasn’t that I was dismissive of them, as I said, I was basically raised by them. 

However, I was still shocked one morning when I found an email in my inbox from Carrie. I was drinking coffee and burned the roof of my mouth at the familiar name that had popped onto my phone screen. The fright brought Anna to my side and she peered over my shoulder at the message.

*Dear Marcus,*

*I’m so sorry this is out of the blue. I’m sure you hardly remember me.*

*I found your email from your mom’s facebook. It sounds stalker-y, I know. This is a hail mary.* 

*Something is off with Terry. Hell, something’s been off with that son of a bitch for years now.* 

*He’s living off at Uncle Anthony’s old camp after a run in with the law and several bad decisions. I’ve gone up a couple times with Dad and Grace to try and talk some sense into him. Mom can barely cope with the whole thing, and nothing is getting anyone anywhere.* 

*I know it’s a stretch, you’re not a kid anymore, but if you see this, please respond. You’re still considered his closest friend, and if not that, his oldest. You might be the only person he’s willing to listen to right now.* 

*Carolyn Archer*

Anna was convinced it was some sort of scam, but the email had brought all those summers and years of my childhood flooding back, so I told her the whole story. After a lot of convincing, I wrote back to Carrie and we exchanged phone numbers. We called that afternoon and she told me everything. It was nice.

Terry had graduated from JHS with high honors and had landed a full ride at some college a few hours south. He had packed up and started what should have been a successful university experience. Then he met Sean Jameson. Sean visited home with Terry once or twice. 

“He was just, weird.” Carrie said. “All hippie and ‘fuck the system’, which would have been cool if he wasn’t cracked out of his mind. He talked about ‘The Return’ all the time. Had something to do with abandoning society, I think, going back to hunting and gathering.”

The longer Terry hung out with Sean, the less he was Terry-like. He changed. First he grew out his hair, then he started dressing “like a bum” according to Mr. and Mrs. Kentie. He stopped going to church, he stopped going to classes, the bags under his eyes grew deeper and deeper, his grades got worse and worse. He stopped coming home. He lost his scholarship. He was on academic probation, then he was expelled for ‘possession of illicit substances’. Terry was screwed.

“What happened to Sean?” Anna asked.

“Disappeared. Last I heard, Terry mentioned something about South America, or at least, I think he did. He was so fucking bleary and coked out, I couldn’t hear him.” Her voice broke.

Terry? A drug addict? My head was spinning. Flashes filled my mind of a gap toothed, brown haired kid who always had some cut or bruise on him that he’d make me look at, maybe touch. Terry? The kid who climbed the pine tree by the community building to save my sister’s kite? 

How could he have come to this?

Carrie and I finished talking, and hung up. I turned to Anna once the call had ended. She didn’t say anything, but we both knew we were thinking the same thing. I opened my laptop to buy a plane ticket to Wyoming, and she went upstairs to pack a bag for me.

36 hours later, I touched down in Sheridan. Everything was exactly as I remembered, and I felt the rental car turn down city streets with practically no help from me. It was as if my memories sitting in the passenger seat willed it to move. I pulled up in front of the Kentie house around ten. It looked more dim than it appeared in my memory. The crabapple tree by the side door was gone, the one I fell out of and broke my wrist. There were still paint stains on the bricks by the front door where Charlotte and Lewis had “decorated for Easter”. And most importantly, Mrs. Kentie was standing at the front door, waving like I had just pulled up on my bike. 

I was only there for a little bit, and per Carrie’s request, I didn’t explain my reason for being there. I could see weariness in Mr. Kentie’s attitude, and I was afraid of Mrs. Kentie’s reaction if I told her I was there to see her son. So, I lied. I told them that I was “just driving through on my way to Casper”. That didn’t stop them from holding me hostage for an extra hour and filling up my car with muffins and trail mix and what I think was a whole roasted chicken. I remember being shocked that the Kentie kids weren’t 300 pounds the way their mother fed them. It was probably all the running around that kept them in shape. 

When I finally got back on the road and plugged in the address Carrie had given me, I realized I’d be at the camp just before the sun was setting. Good, I wasn’t a fan of driving in the dark. 

The drive there was extremely pleasant. The hills and trees and small towns I passed took me right back to camping trips with my family. We didn’t have a camp, but that didn’t mean Dad didn’t try to get us out and about as much as he could. We’d camp in thick sleeping bags, curled under the stars like brightly colored grubs. We’d catch fish and cook them over the fire, hike, and swim. I loved it all. 

Was Terry alright? Maybe he was detoxing. That would make him irritable, right? Carrie had been cryptic in her explanation of his attitude when she tried to talk to him. The way she described it, I worried I’d come in contact with some nonverbal, hairy, bigfoot-type Terry. But if his bad example wasn’t around anymore and he was realizing the error of his ways, stubborn Terry was absolutely the kind of guy to distance himself completely and reflect. Maybe the mountain air and game was already finishing the job. Maybe when I took this corner up the road, I’d turn onto the driveway and see Terry reading National Geographic in a hammock. 

The car crunched up the lip of the road and pulled into the drive. The camp wasn’t humble. A two story log-cabin style structure surrounded by grass, with an open garage on the side. I could see canoes lining the walls and a kayak under a tarp, along with Terry’s Honda. It looked horrible, covered in mud and bird shit, the grass growing through the gaps in the tires. 

On the other side of the yard, I saw a woodshed, like a one story, condensed version of the house. There was sound coming from behind it, someone chopping wood. I turned the car off, stepping out and slamming the door.

“Terry?” I called, tentatively.

I immediately tensed. What if I was completely wrong? I was alone in the woods with a convict, who was probably on something. And I was breezing onto his property? While he had an axe? Genius.

I thought about jumping into my car and leaving, but before I could turn around, a head popped around the corner of the shed.

“Hey!”

A shirtless, bearded man with long hair pulled back walked out from behind the structure. The way he walked cemented my knowledge that it was still Terry, and I realized, though it had been years since I saw him, since I *spoke* with him, he was still my best friend. He walked across the space separating us until he was a few feet away from me.

“Ya lost, friend?”

He was still holding the ax. I cleared my throat.

“Hey, Terry. It’s me, Marcu-” his face changed in a split second.

“Jesus Christ!” I was suddenly yanked into a bone-crushing hug, the thud of the axe against the ground making my heart slow down a little bit. Terry smelled like sweat and woodsmoke. “Oh my god, you’re really here!”

He held me at arms length, presumably so he could get a solid look at me. His voice was deeper than I had expected. As he had gotten closer, I saw how strong he had gotten. Terry was a couple inches shorter than me as a kid, something I bullied him about relentlessly. Now, he was my height, and broader than I was. This time in the wilderness had changed him. I could feel his vice-like grip on my arms, firm and with an edge of control.

This was not the man I expected to find. I was ready to fight an emaciated concept of what used to be my best friend, or carry out his body, worst case scenario.Terry looked better than I ever thought I’d see him. A great big smile, the same laugh, just pitched down now, and a kind heart. 

“Come on in! You hungry? I caught some trout earlier that I was going to fry up, and I think we have some raspberries still. If not, we can head out tomorrow and get them ourselves.”

It was the best dinner I’d eaten in, well, ever. They say hunger was the best sauce, and, yeah, I was pretty hungry, but my company made it even better. Terry told me about the woods, his woods. He told me about a river that cut through the mountain, where he collected water for drinking and showering. He was almost done fitting the house for a well, but didn’t talk too much about it. He told me about the bobcat that had roamed through a month ago, and how he had a family of cardinals living in the eves of the woodshed.

Terry went to the fridge, grabbing two beers, and we sat out on the porch, watching the stars come out. From our seats, I could see the stump, the one I knew immediately the Kentie kids had used as their White Wolf base, years and years ago. 

My reason for being there came back to me then. I turned to look at Terry. A quintessential mountain man, sipping a beer, shirtless in the summer breeze. I almost wanted to stay quiet, hang out with him a few more days and then leave him to live up here. He seemed happy enough.

“Did Dad send you?”

It was a simple question, yet I felt my stomach drop like he was chastising me.

“No.”

“Mom?”

“Carrie.” 

He nodded, his jaw set. I watched him for a moment before continuing. 

“They’re just worried about you, you know? I don’t know a lot, and I’m sorry I wasn’t in touch for so long. Maybe if I had called you sooner, things would have been different.”“I don’t know if they would have.”“What do you mean?”

“Marcus, I know I did some stupid shit, and I know there’s a chance that Mom and Dad aren’t going to be happy even if I did come back. The choices I made have consequences. And I know that. But look around us! Look at me! I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in years. Yeah, Sean wasn’t the greatest compatriot, but he taught me what I needed to know. I’m a better man for it. Even if, even if you never moved away, I have a feeling I would have been led to this place some way or another.”

“This place?” Terry turned in his seat so he could look at me head on. “Mom and Dad thought Sean was some sort of nutso, feel-good, hippie freak. They weren’t wrong, but they weren’t exactly right either. Sean told me about all this, the trees, nature, the growing world around us. Do you really think humans are going to win in the end?”I realized after a second that the question wasn’t rhetorical.

“Uhh, well, no. When we’re gone, I doubt we’ll be able to leave a mark that we were ever here.”Terry slapped the arm of his chair, laughing. “Exactly! See? You get it! All this is temporary. Grass still grows through pavement, bumps in sidewalks shape from roots of trees, roads wash out in floods, it will all go back to Mother Nature.”

I remembered something Carrie had said. “It will all… return?”

“And so will we.” Terry looked at the sky again. “Sean knew that, and he knew he wasn’t going to wait around for it to happen. He cut out the middleman.”The conversation, I realized, had taken a darker turn than I wanted it to. “What- what did Sean do?”

Terry finished his drink and placed the empty bottle on the ground with a muted *ca-clink.* 

“What would you do if you knew you could control your death?”

I blinked. “What?”

“Sean found a way to control his end, even extend his time on this plane of existence. He told me how to do it too. I’ve separated from society, probably further than he had. I’m in better shape than he ever was, apart from when I was still at school. I cracked the code. The more open your mind is, the easier it is to return, but…” he held up his arm, slowly flexing the muscles. “...the more ready your mortal body is, the more control you’ll have once you’ve returned.”I couldn’t believe any of this. But I needed to assess the situation. Terry wasn’t on anything, and one bottle of Bud Lite was nowhere near enough to get someone talking like this. Maybe I could contact the police, or a suicide helpline, or something to get Terry out of the woods by himself. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I nearly missed Terry standing up.

When I looked up, he was by the stump in the back. I watched him run his hand along the side of it. 

“Marcus?”“Yeah, Terry?”“You don’t have to say yes. You can laugh and go to bed, or drive off, or whatever you want.”“What’s up, man?”He straightened up and turned to me.

“Will you play White Wolf with me again? Just, you know, one more time.”

We flipped a coin to see who was it. When Terry turned to count, I sprinted off towards the house, making a lot of noise on the gravel driveway before creeping back around the house to throw him off my scent. It was as if I was in middle school again, out late because our parents hadn't called us to come in yet, playing games that had higher stakes than needed. 

One thing I didn’t mention about White Wolf is the hiding strategy. You want a good hiding spot, but it also needs to be one you can evacuate from quickly if the wolf gets too close. My favorite places were trees with big branches, closed-topped slides, and fallen logs, places you could scope out the wolf. I wasn’t going into the woods, but that didn’t leave many good spots for a grown man. I snapped my head around, looking for spaces I could use. My eyes landed on the woodshed and its odd roof. 

The roof of the shed didn’t completely connect with the walls. I could hear Terry in the distance, somewhere in the fifties already. I didn’t have a lot of time left. 

The door was locked, its key on a hook in Terry’s kitchen. I knew he wouldn’t look inside. I chose to scale the wall, using the edge of the opposite walls as hand and footholds. Pulling myself onto the top of the wall, I eased my legs through the gap until I was balancing on my stomach, holding the sides of the roof and walls to brace myself. Blindly, I tried to find a foothold. There was what seemed to be a stack of uncut logs in one corner, or buckets, or something. Whatever they were, I had a place to put my left foot and still be able to see out the top. 

When we had started, I had worried that it was going to be too dark. Would he be able to see me? But now that my eyes had adjusted, I knew he’d be fine. The moon was pretty full, and the light from the house reached a little farther than I had expected. I was still facing the woods, but there was space to jump out and get away if Terry got close. 

I know. No one else was there to shout “White Wolf!” to. If I was caught, the game was over. I wasn’t doing this to please myself. I was doing it for my best friend. 

Terry had stopped counting. I held my breath, trying to listen for the gravel sounds. He would probably look in the garage, maybe even in the parked cars. 

Instead, I heard the soft swish of grass moving. Heavy steps getting closer. And, ragged breathing? If Terry was trying to freak me out, it was working. I sunk lower behind the wall, putting more weight on my left leg. I got low enough that I could just hardly see over the edge of the wall.

There he was. He came into view behind the shed, looking over his shoulder and around the yard and house behind him. He was holding his chest, like he’d just run a mile, and his muscles were twitching and jerking beneath his skin.

What happened next is nothing that I can explain. It all took place within a minute, and yet I felt like I sat in the shed watching for hours. Terry fell to his knees, wheezing and gasping. The way air was expelled from his lungs more than it was taken in made my chest ache. He coughed and sputtered over the moonlit grass, and I watched the flecks of spit turn into gobs of foam. The sounds coming from Terry’s throat were grating, and I was shocked the effort of coughing and breathing hadn’t torn anything. I opened my mouth, a “You alright?” ready on the tip of my tongue. 

Terry’s right shoulder shot down and back as his spine pushed up and forward, punctuated with a wet crack. He yelled, still coughing, as the other shoulder followed suit. The skin on his back bruised and stretched with the new bone placement. My jaw dropped, anything I could think to say gone completely from my mind. 

Terry’s arm had dropped from his chest, and he crouched down on the ground, still coughing. It was mixed with something else now. The coughs had inflections, rhythmic, yet random. His face flitted towards the house again and I caught the look in his eye. I had only seen it once before, when we had snuck into the yard of a house on my block. The house with a dog hiding under the porch that had leapt out, snapping at us, breaking off its leash. The look in Terry’s eyes right now matched the ones I saw when I stopped at the fence to boost him over: raw terror. 

He was still coughing, but it was labored, wheezy. He pushed himself weakly on to all fours, gasping. The rippling movement under his skin was back, and moving towards his neck. 

With no warning, Terry’s arms snapped forward with sick cracks. He screamed, watching the bones grind against themselves and contort his tendons, pulling his fingers back at odd angles. He was openly crying now, wet sobs punctuated by cries of pain. He looked like he was trying to stand up, holding most of his weight on his legs with the little strength he had left. 

My ears were ringing, all staticy. It felt like nothing around me was making any sound, and yet I could hear the hair on Terry’s body moving in the wind. I was both dead to the world and hyper-aware of everything taking place before me. I tried to yell, or cry, or do something to help my best friend, but my body wouldn’t do what my brain was screaming at it to do.

Crunch. Another bloodcurdling scream. Terry’s knee had shot backwards, popping out of socket and bringing the rest of the leg with it, skewing into a leg fastened the wrong way. He still had his jeans on, and in a frenzy of movement, he tore at them with hideous, destroyed arms and nails. I don’t know if his hip had dislocated as well, but his thigh seemed shorter. The bones he had were breaking and contorting, leaving the skin on Terry’s body to fold and bunch in unnatural ways. 

The other leg followed suit, and at the same time, Terry’s feet began to extend, stretching and popping as what once were his heels grew longer and longer. He never stopped crying. 

It was awful. At first it was condensed, like he was trying to man up and just “get through” his own body mauling itself. But as the seconds ticked by, the groans became screams, which became shrieks, which became pitiful begs. He called for his mom at one point, tugging at his hair and clumps of grass with shriveled, bruised hands. He cried for his dad, for his siblings, for God, for the devil. He bubbled out threats, then promises, then pleas, all while the remainder of his original body bastardized itself. 

I think we both vomited at the same time. I know I did, and when I looked back up at what once was my friend, he had his eyes fixed on me. I prayed he’d think I was a vision, or a trick of the light. 

“M-marcus…” 

His eyes were bloodshot, his nose was bleeding, and he was staring right at me. Gritting his broken teeth, he forced what was once his muscled arm up towards me. It was a thirteen year old Terry reaching to climb back over the fence.

And we both knew he couldn’t outrun the dog this time. 

His hand dropped to the ground, the visceral tears and grating of the rest of his body echoing in the silent space as he did. His other front limb, I couldn’t even call them arms anymore, followed it, grabbing the ground as he tried to claw towards me. His back extended, and I heard his backbone dislocate and split, each vertebrae like a gunshot. Where his pelvis was, a lump was forming, the skin bruising like his back had, and how his limbs were.

“Marc-cus, please…”

My mouth was bone dry. My hands gripped the wall so hard I could feel splinters needling their way into my hands. Bile dripped from my lips and stained my shirt. 

“....help...me…”

I wanted to stop it. I wanted to climb over this fucking wall and grab him and *fix* him. I wanted to go back to that night at the park and *not* play. I wanted to go to college with him. I wanted to kill Sean. I wanted to kill *Terry*. What would be the mercy? What would bring the end? 

“Terry…” my voice wasn’t my own. It was the one I used after breaking my wrist. I sounded like a scared boy again, desperate for everything around me to be some fucked up dream. 

“MaaaAARR-” his head tilted up and back. Too far. The vertebrae popped. His skull caved above his forehead. There was something wrong with the front of his throat. I thought it was his windpipe forcing its way up his larynx. The skin strained and split and I saw…

Black? Something black and shiny was forcing its way out of Terry. It glistened oily in the pale light, and more was appearing by the second. Terry’s face had collapsed, his eyes were dark, and yet by some horrible mystery, he was continuing to scream. The lines of red, hot tears were like scars on his deflated face, and the thing was getting bigger on his throat. It was...what the fuck was that? I saw a snout, and jaws, sharp, white canines, like a mockery of Terry’s broken teeth that I could still see through his slack, blood coated lips. There was a crust of yellow white on the nose of whatever was in him, a sick smell I registered even this far from him. Like a broken egg, or an embryonic sac. 

The flap of skin that was once my friend’s face finally dropped, flattened by the lack of mass within it. It flopped sickeningly against his shoulders, the long hair coming loose from its tie and sticking to his sweat-sheened skin. 

Terry’s final cry echoed around me. It was bouncing off the trees, free in the air, and swirling around in the shed with me. But the skin covered lie of an animal lay quiet on the ground, quivering like a newborn deer. 

I must have stared at it for an hour. Then it twitched, and I saw its head come up. It’s eyes met mine.

There was not a trace of the man I once knew in them. The eyes in that face were an animal’s, deep and dark. It got up, hind legs first. There wasn’t any wobble or uncertainty. Seeing the mangled human body move like that made my stomach turn again. The lump once at the base of his back had produced a sickly looking tail, and every inch of the thing’s body was covered in a fine layer of hair. 

The fuzz caused it to have a haze of light around it. I watched its glowing shape turn from me and trot away from me. The thing had made it to the edge of the woods.

Before it disappeared into the dark, it looked back at me, and just as it melted into the deep black of the trees, I heard myself speak.

“White Wolf.”

I said it in a whisper, my throat raw and high. 

I stayed in the shed for hours. I stayed until I had cried myself into eyes swollen and stomach completely empty. I stayed until the sun rose. Only when I could see that I was completely alone, I climbed out of the shed.

I have been driving since. I know I’ll need to stop and find somewhere to return this rental. Hell, maybe I’ll fucking buy it to get home. I just need to get a different plane ticket. Right now, it feels better to drive. I’ve stopped just outside of Denver, and I’m sitting in a gas station writing this. I don’t know what the point of it is, now that I have to consider the words I’ve written. I was writing this as, I don’t even know, a report to the police? What would they do? Would they even believe me? Do I send this to Carrie? Would *she* even believe me?

Maybe if someone finds this, someone more qualified, they can help me. I need to know more. If you know a man by the name of Sean Jameson, please contact me. If you know anything *about* him, please contact me. I need to know what happened to Terrence Kentie. Was it the game that destroyed him? Was it the company he kept? Was it something more than him, more than me, more than humanity itself? 

Whatever it was, keep yourself safe. I have seen what happened to those who were careless with their lives. 

I have seen the White Wolf.

Before diving into Smartliner specifics, let's address the core issue: why are floor mats so vital? The factory-installed carpet in most vehicles is designed for aesthetics, not durability. It's vulnerable to:

   **Dirt and Grime:** everyday use tracks in dirt, dust, and debris, which can become deeply embedded in the carpet fibers. This not only looks unsightly but can also lead to unpleasant odors and premature wear.
   **spills:** Accidents happen. Coffee,soda,or even melted snow can stain and damage your carpet,leading to costly detailing or even replacement.Spill proof floor mats are a great investment to prevent that from happening.
   **Weather:** Rain, snow, and mud can wreak havoc on your vehicle's interior. Moisture can lead to mold and mildew growth, while road salt can corrode the metal underneath the carpet. All weather floor protection is key.
   **Wear and Tear:** Constant friction from shoes can wear down the carpet fibers over time, creating bald spots and reducing the overall value of your vehicle.

Investing in quality floor mats is a proactive way to safeguard your vehicle's interior, preserve its resale value, and maintain a clean and pleasant driving environment.

## smartliner vs. WeatherTech: A Head-to-Head Comparison

smartliner and WeatherTech are two of the leading brands in the floor mat market. Both offer custom-fit floor liners designed to provide superior protection. However, there are some key differences:

**Material:**

   **Smartliner:** Typically uses HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene), a rigid plastic material.
   **WeatherTech:** Uses a proprietary Thermoplastic Olefin (TPO),which is a more flexible and rubber-like material.

**Texture:**

   **Smartliner:** Generally has a smoother, less textured surface.
   **WeatherTech:** Features a more pronounced textured surface for added grip.

**Price:**

   **Smartliner:** Often more affordable than WeatherTech. Check for smartliner floor mats price online to ensure you get the best deal.
   **WeatherTech:** Typically commands a premium price.

**Durability:**

Both brands are known for their durability, but the HDPE material of Smartliner might potentially be slightly more resistant to punctures and tears, while WeatherTech's TPO may be more resistant to cracking in extreme temperatures.

**Aesthetics:**

Aesthetic preferences are subjective. Some users prefer the more rugged look of WeatherTech, while others prefer the cleaner look of Smartliner.

1jsdsx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mixing/comments/1jsdsx0/looking_for_advice_studio_internship_vs_building/,Looking for Advice: Studio Internship vs. Building Independently as a Mixer,"Hey everyone,

I’m at a crossroads and would love some perspective from those further along in their careers.

I’ve been playing instruments for years, and I started learning music production in the summer of 2022. It began as a hobby, but about a year and a half in, I realized I wanted to pursue it professionally. Since then, I’ve been putting in 20+ hours a week improving my skills, connecting with other artists, and laying the groundwork to transition into audio work full-time.

This is the first thing I’ve done that’s consistently fueled my passion and focus.

At this point, I feel like I’m entering a new phase. My skills have grown to where I can confidently help artists bring their ideas to life. I’ve built out a home studio in a bedroom of my house, and I’ve mapped out a plan to build my portfolio to the point where I feel ready to start charging for mixing by late 2025.

Here’s where I’m torn:
Should I pause those plans and try to land an internship at a professional studio?

On one hand, the hands-on experience and mentorship could be invaluable. On the other, with how advanced home recording setups have become — and given how vibrant and collaborative the arts community is in my city — I’m wondering if it might be more worthwhile to stay independent. I could keep sharpening my skills at home, work with local artists, and seek feedback from more experienced folks directly.

I’ve also heard that internships can be major time sinks — sometimes amounting to long hours doing menial tasks just to pick up small bits of knowledge. I’m nearing 30, and I’m not sure I can afford to spend years getting coffee in exchange for insights that I might be able to get through other means.

So I’m wondering:
Is a studio internship still a valuable path in 2025, or would I be better off investing that time into my own studio and community connections?

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been through this — especially folks who have taken either (or both) of these paths.

Thanks in advance!

District Court

Defendant Lobby No. 2



Trucy:  Great job, Daddy!  Way to show 'em who's boss!



Phoenix:  Ha, ha.  Thanks, Trucy.  Guess the old man's still got it.



Trucy:  I can't wait to get home and get started on dinner.  It's spaghetti and meatballs night!



Phoenix:  (My stomach's already growling.  Trucy makes the best meatballs.  But she still won't tell me what she puts in 'em.)



Trucy:  And I never will!



Phoenix:  !  (I hate that she always knows what I'm thinking.)



Trucy:  Then maybe you shouldn't make your face so easy to read!



Phoenix:  ...



Ema:  Great job out there, Mr. Wright!



Phoenix:  Thanks.  And thanks, as always, for the assist.



Ema:  All in a day's work!  Say, Trucy, would you mind giving me a minute alone with your Dad, please?



Trucy:  Sure, no problem, Ms. Skye!



Ema:  Thanks, kiddo.  Here's a few bucks for the vending machine.  Have a treat, on me!



Trucy:  Oh wow!  Thanks!



Phoenix:  Don't spoil your dinner, Truce.... aaaand she's gone.



Phoenix:  So, what can I do for you, Ema?



Ema:  I was just wondering if maybe you'd like to get a coffee sometime.  Maybe tomorrow?



Phoenix:  Really?  The hardworking Detective Ema Skye, making a social call?  Are you feeling OK?  Don't tell me you're dying... !



Ema:  Very funny, Mr. Wright.  I just thought it might be nice for us to sit and talk about something other than bloodstains and fingerprints.



Phoenix:  ... I guess you're right.  (Gosh, I've known Ema forever, but she's right.  It is always about work.)



Ema:  So, what do you say?  Tres Bien, tomorrow morning, 9 AM?



Phoenix:  Sure, let's do it.  (... Wait, Tres Bien?!  I hate Tres Bien!)



Ema:  Sounds good.  See you then!





November 6, 8:59 AM

Tres Bien



Phoenix:  (It's nice of Ema to offer to do this.  I feel like I haven't just sat and talked with anyone besides Trucy in a while.

Not that Trucy isn't great, but a guy needs some adult conversation too.)



Ema:  Mr. Wright!  Hey!  Over here!



Phoenix:  Oh, hey, Ema!



Ema:  How's the coffee here, anyway?  I've never had it before.



Phoenix:  It's, uh...



Ema:  It's terrible, isn't it?



Phoenix:  Well, I've heard things.  But you never know.  The place has been under new management for a while, so maybe it's changed.



Ema:  Guess we'll have to find out.



(We spent well over two hours, just sitting and talking.  About food, music... just about anything, other than work.)







November 6, 11:23 AM

Ema:  Wow, the time really flew by.  This was fun.  Thanks, Mr. Wright.



Phoenix:  Hey, it was your idea.  I should be thanking you.  You'll have to send me that pineapple salsa recipe.  It sounds fantastic.



Ema:  Sure thing!  Actually, better yet, how about I make it for you?  You have anything going on tomorrow night?



Phoenix:  I think Trucy's practicing for her magic show, but I don't have any plans.  Just quality time with the TV.



Ema:  Good.  Tomorrow, 6 PM, my apartment.  Here's the address... 



Phoenix:  !  (She... kissed me on the cheek, as she handed me the card with her address on it...)

Phoenix:  (... and winked at me as she walked away.  What... what did I just agree to?!  Oh, mannnn.... She has no idea about Iris.  I never told her

about Iris! She has no idea there's someone, still in prison, waiting for me.

Ema:  Hey!  Right on time!  So, I made the salsa, I've got chips, taco meat's just about done, and I have all the fixings.



Phoenix:  It does smell really good in here.  Listen, Ema, I think there's been a misunderst--



Ema:  Don't, Phoenix.



Phoenix:  ... ?



Ema:  Please don't say what you're about to say.  I know... I get it, OK?  I get it.  You helped me when I was a kid, and since then, we've just

been co-workers.  I know it's weird, and I know people will talk.  But I'm doing this of my own free will.



Phoenix:  Ema, you don't have to...



Ema:  You've helped so many people.  You've been so unselfish.  But you've never done anything for yourself.  You deserve to be happy, too.

And you deserve to have someone who makes you happy.



Phoenix:  I have Trucy, though.



Ema:  That's not the same thing.  Come on.  You know what I mean.  I mean having someone truly \*with\* you.  After everything you've gone

through, you deserve some relief... and I want to be that for you.



Phoenix:  ...



Ema:  Is it Ms. Fey?  Do you and Ms. Fey have something going on?



Phoenix:  No!  No, it's not like that with me and Maya.  We're just friends. (Don't tell Pearls that, though...)



Ema:  ...



Phoenix:  (... I should be telling her about Iris right now, but I'm worried she'll think I'm making her up just to get out of this.)



Ema:  Please, Phoenix.  Give me a chance to be that person for you.



Phoenix:  I... (You WHAT, Phoenix?!  Say no!)  I...



(Ema's smoke alarm goes off from the neglected beef on the stove)



Ema:  Ohhhh boy!  Think the beef's done!  Quick!  Fire extinguisher!



Phoenix:  I, uh, where... ?



Ema:  Ugh!  Never mind, I've got it!



(Ema puts out the stove fire)



Ema:  Phew... well, that's a mess.  Looks like it's just a little bit too done.  Great first impression, Ema.



Phoenix:  Hey, not to worry.  I'll order us some Chinese.  (You'll WHAT?!)



Ema:  ... Thanks, Phoenix.  Sorry this didn't go as planned.



Phoenix:  Don't feel bad.  I almost burned down my dorm room once, when I tried to make tacos for D... for, uh... (For Dollie, better known as Iris,

your GIRLFRIEND, you ding dong!) For, a uh, friend of mine.



Ema:  OK, but I bet you I can top that... so, it's the night before my term paper is due...



(We talked for hours, ate the food that came, and Ema even brought out some wine, which I promptly partook in, without thinking twice...)







November 7, 11:41 PM

Ema's Apartment



Ema:  So, those were all my terrible boyfriends from college.  What about you?  Did you have anybody, back then?



Phoenix:  (This is your chance, dummy.  This is the part where you tell her all about the girl who loved you for you, who validated your

faith in her, and who has stood by you through thick and thin, even though it had to be from prison...)



Phoenix:  ... Just one.  It wasn't anything super serious, though.



Ema:  Well, good.  At least you had some time in your life when it wasn't a parade of craziness.



Phoenix:  Heh.  It would be nice to get some of that back.  But, hey, it's getting late, I should get going.



Ema:  Oh, uh, yeah, let me just walk you out the door...



Phoenix:  Thanks for this, Ema.  It was nice to finally relax, and mmmfff -- !  (She's... kissing me.  I'm not really kissing her

back, but... I'm not pulling away, either.)  I'll, uh... I'll t-talk you you soo--



Ema:  Wait.  Phoenix... please wait.



Phoenix:  ... (She grabbed my arm pretty forcefully.  She seems... almost desperate?)



Ema:  Can you please stay... just a little longer?



Phoenix:  ... (Everything inside me is screaming that I should walk away right now, go home, and forget this ever happened.... So, why can't

I pull myself away?).................................................. All right.







November 8, 6:33 AM



Phoenix: ... Hm?  (Where am I?)



Ema:  Mmm... hey, sleepy head.  Last night was fun, huh?



Phoenix:  (Oh, God.  Oh, no no no...  I slept with Ema.  I SLEPT with EMA!)  Oh, God... I have to go.



Ema:  Wait, Phoenix... !



Phoenix:  I need to get home, I... -- ?!  (I opened Ema's front door, and pretty much the last person I wanted to see was standing there.)



Edgeworth:  You SLEPT with her?!  You SLEPT with MS. SKYE!?  Have you no decency?!



Phoenix:  E-Edgeworth?  How did you know I was here?



Edgeworth:  Your \*daughter\* called me in the middle of the night, panicking because you hadn't come home, and weren't answering your phone.  

Did you forget that you had a daughter?!



Phoenix:  Trucy... ohhh man...



Edgeworth:  Oh, good, how nice of you to finally remember.  At any rate, as I began to round up a search party, one of the people I called was

none other than Ms. Skye, who told me that everything was fine and that you were with her.



Phoenix:  ...



Edgeworth:  Nothing to say, Wright?  Because this would be the time for you to tell me that this is all just a misunderstanding, you

simply were overworked, and you passed out on her couch.



Phoenix:  ...



Edgeworth:  Unbelievable, Wright.



Ema:  Hey, what's going on?



Phoenix:  ... Edgeworth just came by to express his dissent with how we spent our evening.  Moreso in me than in you.



Ema:  First of all, Mr. Edgeworth, not only was our evening together consensual, it was entirely my idea.



Edgeworth:  ...



Ema:  Secondly, since when is who I sleep with any of your business?!



Edgeworth:  ... Duly noted, Ms. Skye.  I shall take my leave of you, then.  Wright, your daughter is waiting at home for you.  \*Your\* home, that is.



And, then, the big dramatic point is that Nick and Ema's night together actually conceived a child.  And Ema wants to keep it.  So now, Nick is torn between his love for Iris and his sense of duty to Ema and take responsibility for what happened.  And, despite EVERYONE around him telling him that they have options, that he doesn't HAVE to be with Ema just for the sake of the child, and Iris even being perfectly willing to forgive him and even help raise the child with Phoenix... dutiful, idealistic Nick insists that he ""can't do that to Iris, can't put that responsibility on her"", etc.

  
Phoenix and Ema work hard to make it work, take on cases together, etc., but in addition to there being a gigantic elephant in the room amongst all their friends, there is growing resentment between them, to the point where Phoenix even accuses Ema of tampering with his protection in order to make it happen.  She denies it.

  
Ema:  You're kidding yourself if you think I wanted this to happen!

(four Psyche Locks.... because she was alone and afraid of losing anyone else)

Ema:  I didn't tamper with anything.  I would never do that.  The protection failed on its own... but there is a part of me that's happy that it happened.

  
Blah blah, etc. etc..... then Phoenix startles awake, realizes he was dreaming.

Phoenix:  (A dream!.... It was all \*huff puff\*... a dream.)

And then an arm pulls him back down into bed... and Ema kisses him on the cheek, and snuggles up to him.

Ema:   Mmm... hey, sleepy head.  Last night was fun, huh?

Hey MaximizeMe crew! I recently felt like my daily schedule was a never-ending game of Tetris, trying to fit everything in and still end up with time for a breather. Turns out, I was scheduling my day *backwards*. Anyone else guilty of this? 🙋‍♂️

I used to cram every available hour with tasks, thinking that time blocking was the magic cure to productivity. But I constantly hit that 3 PM slump and wondered why it took me four hours to do something that should take one. Here’s the twist: I realized it wasn’t about packing the hours with tasks, but about matching those tasks to my **energy peaks**.

Here’s what flipped the script for me:

- **Morning Energy = Deep Work:** Let’s be real, some parts of the day we’re just more *alive*. I’m talking full-on spinach-eating Popeye mode. 🥬 I started reserving my mornings for activities requiring creative or analytical power. It’s the time when I can truly focus and bang out work with minimal distractions. Those early hours are prime real estate. Why waste them on emails?

- **Post-Lunch Slump = Routine Tasks:** Around 1 PM, my brain falls into a nap deficit without fail. So, I reserve the after-lunch slot for routine tasks that don’t need my A-game. Think sorting emails, basic admin tasks, or catching up on the latest cat memes (totally counts as market research, right?).

- **Afternoon Revival = Collaborative Tasks:** Once I’ve had my afternoon coffee (or two), I’m back in the zone. Perfect time for team calls, brainstorming sessions, or anything that thrives on a bit of social energy. It’s like tapping into a second wind before the day winds down.

Switching up my schedule this way saved me **10 hours a week**. *No joke.* I even found time to rediscover things I love outside of work—bet you can’t guess how many sourdough loaves I baked last month. 🍞

So, what’s your energy peak? *Early bird or night owl?* Experiment with your schedule and let your energy dictate your day. It’s amazing what shifts when you stop trying to force productivity on a tired brain.

For coffee lovers, the quest for the perfect cup is a never-ending journey.

The Philips LatteGo system has been a popular contender in this market for years, but in the ever-evolving landscape of espresso machines, does it STILL hold the title of ""best""?

## Understanding the Philips LatteGo Appeal

The Philips LatteGo system is renowned for its simplicity and ease of use. Unlike customary milk frothing systems that often involve complex tubes and challenging cleaning processes, the LatteGo’s milk container is composed of only two parts (plus the lid in certain models), designed for quick and easy cleaning. This alone is a major draw for busy professionals and families who want a delicious latte without the hassle.

But is easy cleaning enough? Let's dive deeper,addressing the specific needs of our audience.

## For the coffee Enthusiast: Diving into the Details

For ardent coffee enthusiasts, the nuances of espresso matter. They appreciate the aroma of freshly ground beans, the richness of the crema, and the silky texture of perfectly frothed milk. The Philips LatteGo espresso machine, particularly the 5400 series, offers a great degree of customization.You can adjust the grind size,coffee strength,and milk volume to tailor each drink to your exact preferences.

Tho, some purists argue that the LatteGo, while capable, doesn't achieve the same level of espresso quality as dedicated espresso machines with more sophisticated pressure and temperature control. It produces excellent coffee,without a doubt,but for seasoned espresso aficionados,a machine focused solely on espresso production might still be preferable.To get the most out of the Philips LatteGo, experimenting with different beans is essential. The machine’s ability to handle various roasts contributes to its user's versatility.

## Convenience for Busy Professionals: Speed and Simplicity

Time is a precious commodity for busy professionals. The Philips LatteGo excels in delivering cafe-quality coffee with minimal effort. The one touch latte feature is a godsend, allowing you to brew a perfect latte or cappuccino with a single press. Prep Time is minimal, clean-up is even less.

The Philips LatteGo 3200 specifically is the right model for this segment. It provides a balance of functionality, speed, and simplicity while being budget-kind. The speed and ease of use are the primary draw here, even if the espresso isn't quite as nuanced as from a more dedicated machine. When it comes to a fantastic cup of coffee before that morning meeting,the Philips LatteGo is a clear winner.

Each family member can customize their preferred drink strength and milk froth setting saving ample time and frustration on that first morning cup of joe. The machine’s reliable performance also makes it a worthwhile investment.

## Upgrading your Espresso Experience: Addressing the Upgrade Dilemma

For consumers looking to upgrade from an older espresso machine, the Philips LatteGo offers several compelling advantages. The ease of cleaning and the consistent milk frothing quality are significant upgrades compared to many traditional machines. Many old machines have complex pieces and parts that often need replacing or become damaged. The Philips LatteGo system is designed for ease of use at every chance.

However,current owners looking to upgrade from base models should access their individual needs. If your current machine doesn't offer the ease of cleaning and milk frothing, the Philips LatteGo is an amazing change. If those are not issues in comparison, research more intricate machines.

## Philips LatteGo Models Compared: 3200 vs. 5400

*   **Philips LatteGo 3200:** This is the entry-level model, offering a great balance of features and affordability. It includes the LatteGo milk system, allowing you to prepare lattes and cappuccinos with ease. It usually comes with 5 coffee settings and is ideal for small to medium households. It is recommended for busy professionals as mentioned earlier.
*   **Philips LatteGo 5400:** The 5400 series is a step above, adding more customization options, including more coffee settings and user profiles. In addition, the 5400 series includes an additional container, allowing for different types of coffee to be stored separate from each other. This model is better suited for larger households or those who want more control over their coffee.

Deciding between the two is frequently enough a function of budget and feature requirements. For most users, the 3200 provides an excellent experience. It is indeed significant to note that depending on location, you may find the Philips LatteGo 4300 or another model. Be sure to check the product manuals to check comparisons and which features are the best fit for your needs,.

## Philips LatteGo Alternatives: Exploring the Competition

Before making a final decision,it's worth considering the Philips LatteGo vs competitors. Other super automatic espresso machines, such as those from saeco (also owned by Philips), De'Longhi, and Jura, offer similar functionality. Some competitors may offer more advanced features, such as mobile app control or more sophisticated brewing technology.However, they may also come with a higher price tag and more complex cleaning requirements.

## Addressing Potential Drawbacks & Troubleshooting

While the Philips LatteGo is generally well-received, some users report issues with espresso strength or milk frothing consistency.

The Philips LatteGo user manual provides detailed instructions on how to optimize these settings for different types of coffee and milk.

Here are a few common troubleshooting tips:

*   **Weak Espresso:** Adjust the Grind size and ensure that the beans are fresh. If too fine, the coffee may be bitter.
*   **Inconsistent Milk froth:** Ensure the LatteGo system is properly assembled and clean.

1jsdndl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAFS_AU/comments/1jsdndl/how_big_and_well_known_is_this_show_in_aus/,How big and well known is this show in AUS?,"I’m in the U.S. and have gotten weirdly hooked on MAFS Australia the last few years. I didn’t even know it existed until around Covid, but since then I’ve been all-in. That said, over here it’s definitely niche. Certain people know it and love it, but it’s not like it’s watercooler talk, especially outside of reality TV fans. For context, I work in the trades, so not exactly the type of crowd discussing MAFS over coffee but even my fiancée (who’s in a professional office setting) says nobody really brings it up.

What got me wondering is how often I see people say that certain contestants have “ruined their lives” by how they acted on the show. And I’m thinking—if you were on the U.S. version and acted like a clown, yeah, it might be embarrassing for a bit, but most people would probably never even know. You could fly under the radar pretty easily unless you went viral.

So I’m curious, is MAFS in Australia a cultural juggernaut like Big Brother used to be in the U.S.? Is it a household-name kind of thing? Do these contestants get recognized regularly and actually deal with fallout from the public? Or is it more like “15 minutes of fame” and you move on?

Would love to hear how it lands on the average Aussie viewer’s radar.

Ephemeral light shimmers between the cobblestones, like stars. A breeze is wrapping its way around my ankles and dragging me down. A light erupts from the sealed room like the spark from a welder's workshop. Small streams of rainwater weave between rocks. It smells oh so familiar- like ichor and sulphur. The stench is hot, collecting at the back of my throat- choking me. A door- splintered and charred- protrudes from the floor like a wrecked ship. Each step I take rouses motes of dust and ash into the air. I left my armour at the doorstep, unpolished and forgotten. It was just another burden to carry, clunking through the cabin. I'm left in a ragged tunic. My boots- new and buffed- squeak under my weight, divulging my presence. My breath is heavy; I can feel each inhale- each exhale- deep in my chest.

I reach the room and wrench off the boards, the rotting wood crumbles in my grasp, leaving nails to fall to the ground- they've rusted into a russet brown, but remnants of their silver lustre still cling to them. The last board collapses and I'm blinded by radiance; opalescent light that sears my skin and leaves my eyes stinging. I hiss instinctively, stepping away. A pit festers in my gut. I close my eyes, but I can see my blood vessels, illuminated by the light that permeates my eyelids. Even as the radiance fades, I keep my eyes shut. I bow my head, digging my nails into my scalp searching for protection. My mouth hangs open as I gasp for air, but it's all polluted. It's rotten and corrupt. I lace my fingers into my hair but with no curls to hook onto, they glide through, falling in front of me. As I open my eyes, I notice each crease, each scar, each callus. My skin is thick, tanned and torn. There is mud around my hardened nail bed. There is dried blood under my nails. My head is still bowed but then I hear her scream echoing in my head.

I snap my head up. It's as if she's simply fallen asleep at her desk. Her long black hair that once flowed like rum is now thickened by blood and is plagued by matted clumps that stick out in their own jagged ways. She glows. Prismatic rays pierce from her body, her skin translucent and splitting like tissue. Light digs into *me.* I’ve inherited her power. I’m overcome by a sense of weightlessness. My shoulders that once hung low from exhaustion and burden, now feel light. Confident. Fresh scars and old calluses on my hands are smoothing over. My weary joints feel renewed. Healed. Nothing heals the gaping fissure in my gut, though. The amalgamated, fanciful knot in my throat persists. I try to swallow it down. I blink the tears away. Bite my tongue till it bleeds and dismiss at the metallic tang filling my mouth. Now I’m close to her. I try to lift her arm but death is heavy. It’s stiff. Cold as ice and heavy as steel. My strength fails me. I let a sob fall through the barricades I was hopelessly defending. I turn her chair and she slumps forwards, so I prop her up. Her eyes are closed; thank the Stars. Her glow is gone now.

I lean backwards against her desk but that’s when it clatters to the ground. A silver dagger. Humming with unspoken power. It casts a shadow blacker than coal, but reflects the dim candlelight like a torch. There is moonstone twisting round the cross-guards and the pallid grey hilt. There’s no blood. Only faint traces of that dreaded ichor- golden and acrid- that cling to the cursed object. I take it into my hands, filled with resentment. It still thrums, mockingly. I beg my hands to stay still. Tacit prayers to a cold and dead goddess whose poems line the walls and whose artwork paints the floor. Each wooden plank is stricken with streaks of dye. Scarred with sunken grooves from where she kept her easel. Always faced away from the window, basking in the sunlight, but not blocking the door- where I would so often lean, as we talked. Where I would read out her writings with admiration. Where I knelt, at her mercy, and asked for her hand in marriage. Where we sang, shrieked and shouted. But here she sits, speaking no more. Breathing no more. Dead.

My head is spinning. I’m filled with vertigo. I fall to my knees, arms wrapped tightly around my gut. Eyes clamped shut. My throat is burning and I cry out. There’s no more numbness, just barbaric agony.

“Logan?”

I block him out. I don’t want him here. His footsteps draw nearer and nearer. This is our space, our death. We will lie here together. Our symphony is complete. I beg and I beg and I beg, please, let us die as tragic lovers, I am not made for a world without her, I am made for her, I will not take another breath. She is dead and I am drowning. I am drowning. I am drowning. I’m holding my breath, choking through sobs, trying so hard to sink into the floor.

He clutches my shoulders.

I am lurched back into the room. His hands are warm, rough as sandpaper, gentle. He lifts me up. As I pin my eyes to the earth he tilts my head upwards. He’s kneeling in front of me, gazing into my soul, reading me, drinking me in with those distant, grey eyes. He breathes slowly, steadily. It’s infectious. He’s as pallid as the moonstone that still presses into my palm, only far less sickening. His swarthy, long hair glides down his face in wreaths, brushing past his sunken cheeks and his scarred jawline. His coat washes over the floor like spilt coffee. He holds me as I shake, sobbing into the crook of his neck, his heartbeat loud, ringing through my ears. Only now do I notice how he’s all skin and bones. He sways under my weight. His fingers are long and spindly, splayed against my back. We hold each other in anguished silence for hours, until he lets go. He stands up. He leaves me.

I can hardly speak.“Charles?”. 

He can hardly hear me. “Where do you want her buried?”.

 I can feel the vertigo coming back, I swallow it down. I pull myself to my feet. “There’s a field. To the east.”. 

He nods, but I see her again. I see her shrunken skin, her matted hair and her unnatural stiffness. I see her poems, her paintings, every mark she’s left on our home. A letter, left neatly on the desk. An unfinished pile of books. I feel that rejuvenating light within me, so out of place. The light she lived with. The power she carried. Now mine. I take her empty body into my arms and carry her outside.  I walk, weighed down, past the damp cobbles and the splintered door. I lay her down in a wagon next to a shovel and some rope. Me and Charles drive out to that field. There is a thick fog, with dark clouds. Day and night have become indistinguishable. I keep my eyes on the tulips.

They envelop the hills. Spasms of mauve cut with green spears. Grand armies that conquered these lands long before we came to build walls and borders. Even seeing them now, I feel all the ire and pain in my heart ricocheting around my chest. Each footstep through the flowers leaves a path leading back to my wagon. The earth is soft beneath my feet, muddying my freshly polished boots. Her power, still unsettled within me, breathes life into the meadow without restraint. The fog clears, bees circle us and birdsong shatters the silence. The flowers seem to bloom with more zeal than before. Charles leads the way, walking briskly. I trudge behind. Ellowyn's corpse on my shoulders. We buried my wife amongst the flowers. Not beneath a headstone- her name plated with gold. Just the tulips. They will whisper her name. They will tell her story. Charles digs with ease, but as I lower her into the fissure, kneeling against the earth, I don’t have the strength to let go. He places his palm against my shoulder, trying to bring me solace, knowing his attempts are futile. I don’t feel the cold. I don’t feel the rocks digging into my knees. The ichor flowing through my veins carries numbness and indifference. I watch as the soil gently reclaims my wife. Charles fills the grave. I sit with the flowers, pressing my hands to the ground and feeling her power seep from my soul. I imagine her, laying in these fields with me as we watch the clouds pass over. I imagine her final moments- alone and desperate inside that room. I dig my nails into my palms but there is no pain to banish my thoughts.

“You can leave.”

I watch Charles walk back to the wagon. The tail of his coat waves in the wind like a coffee-stained flag. I sat there for weeks. Till the fog returned and rain began to fall. Till I saw the tulips begin to grow over the ground where she was buried. Till I felt my beard grow long. I didn’t feel the famine, nor the cold. Only the festering desperation for that which is impossibly gone.

1jsdljo,https://youtu.be/6YqtynoNxVY,Male Loneliness Epidemic Isn't Real - It's a Male Entitlement Crisis,"Have you all seen that Scott Galloway appearance on the Diary of a CEO pod making the rounds right now?  His takes on male loneliness have been all over social media and I think he is leading the absolute wrong conversation.  So, I made a video essay refuting it point by point.

Galloway spits out all of this Tinder math (a man needs to swipe 200 times to get one coffee date - the HORROR!) and says that when men can't easily order a woman on Tinder, of course they feel rejected and get radicalized into misogyny and fascism.  And like - WHAT?!  If online dating isn't working, then go join a volleyball league or something!  We need to stop validating and reinforcing the culture of male narcissism where men feel entitled to receive a woman to subsidize their lives and pleasure them.  Women can't be ordered like McDonald's on postmates!  And that's not a reason to destroy democracy!

Obviously, this perspective isn't just Galloway - it's a very common perspective, but that doesn't make it right or productive.  It's frustrating when these conversations are all calibrated to enabling men's learned helplessness instead of confronting the culture of patriarchal entitlements that are truly causing the dysfunction.

In my video essay, I break down what Galloway blew through about partner expectations.  Galloway essentially says that the average man would accept the average woman, but the average woman wouldn't accept the average man and makes it seem like women are being arbitrary and cruel towards men without actually looking at expectations either party are upholding.

So I do a deep dive of all the subsidizing labor men expect to receive from women vs the myths of protector and provider men assume they are offering innately, without any effort. 

Ultimately, I believe the average man isn't seeking to love a woman - he's seeking to be loved and SUBSIDIZED by a woman.  I believe the average woman is seeking true partnership and to love and be loved.  I'm not saying women are perfect and men are evil, but I am saying that women shouldn't abandon upholding the basic standard of a man's presence must improve my quality of life for him to stay in it.

1jsdjz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1jsdjz3/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

When I met my that one friend I was 19, it was a time when all my then-friends and I got separated due to college and my mom quit her job so I'd quarrel with her every single day due to religious stuff

He entered my life at that exact time period, I loved talking to him a lot and I was quite afraid of losing him. He wasn't like anyone I've known, we could talk about various topics from insects to linguistics. Also, it wasn't like he was all knowing or i was all knowing, we both had knowledge to gift each other and I'll appreciate that time period till my last breath ngl

The thing is, since i was afraid of losing him, i avoided confrontation, i even wished to mimic everything he was. For example, at the beginning of college I'd just sit on back benches and read books to seem smart, too smart to bother with socializing.. That's quite embarrassing to remember that because 2 months later he'd tell me going to movies with his classmates which left me disappointed. According to him loneliness was intellectually superior, reading was intellectually superior, i did all of those but what's that superiority for if i have zero human connection? That was the case. I'd meet him irl once in two months or so, other than him I had no one to talk to

I even remember feeling anxious when I accepted being a bridesmaid at my cousin's wedding party, because there were no ways to intellectualize that. According to him most stuff that are regarded as normal are illogical, from going to concerts to posting coffee stories on instagram. Only for that reason I avoided photoshoots as a bridesmaid because i had to be his intellectual counterpart even though he didn't even know about the existence of my cousin's wedding party... Now looking back, it was only an important day for my cousin and she wanted to have fun with her loved ones in her ways, f*ck if that's rational or not, even if that's going to me inferior f*ck if that's rational or not

Anyway, this year I started doing internship along with my studies and thus I found chance to socialize with my classmates, they were all amazing people on their own tbh. I met my boyfriend at that time, he's my first ever boyfriend and when he asked me out I hesitated a lot but told myself ""Remember how you rejected socializing with others but he got another friends, live your goddamn life"" and started dating him. At the beginning of my relationship I hid it from my that one friend but then I felt like it was disrespecting my boyfriend so I gave him clues that I'm now experiencing sexually, he then put distance with me. When I posted a pic of my bf and I cuddling my that one friend cut all contacts with me for the reason I don't know why

I probably became someone he didn't respect anymore, I probably became a normie to him because I was doing something normies would do, dating! On the other hand, I remember him once telling me how he thinks blocking someone is a normie behavior unless they're being disturbing, now is he the normie? Or i became so intellectually inferior that he had to be a normie? I really don't know

Now I love my bf with our ups and downs, I have some other people to chat with, and I don't feel like that's degrading me. Other people also have a lot of knowledge to gift me, other people are unique with their own experiences.

To be honest, I don't miss him, but his impact still lingers on me. For example, when someone is excitedly talking to me about cars I feel the urge to change the topic because my that one friend found cars and talking about cars illogical because he values public transportation more (I also don't give a damn about cars as much as public transportation but why'd preferring priv. transport. degrade anyone)

That goes for bunch of topics, cars were just an example. I do miss talking about saving the world with him but I want to get rid of yhe impact he left on me. I became an atheist rejecting a prophet, I became a positivist thinker rejecting spirituality, to be what? To act like someone's my prophet? How do I get rid of that tbh? I know the main step is building a little sekf esteem but that also feels like a step too far for me",2,1743886493.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

I completely lost control of my body and breathing.,"I'm a 38 year old male, on vacation in Hawaii from Canada. I have auto immune issues (ulcerative colitis) and take a biologic called Entyvio, as well as sulphasalazine to limit the side effects of entyvio. I have been in remission for 3-4 years with no symptoms. Also take vitamin B12 and folic acid as recommended by my specialist. 

I don't use drugs, but I do drink alcohol (not on this day, but had maybe 3 drinks, margaritas the night before. Enough for a slight buzz but not drunk). If it matters I don't put salt in my margs either. 

I am a Canadian on vacation in Hawaii, big island. I'm 6'3 230lb and very active. I work a physical job on the water, and play sports. I consider myself in good shape but maybe not an athlete. 

Yesterday while on vacation the group had the plan to accend the volcano with the observatory on top to watch the sunset. We stopped at the visitor center at 9000 feet for 30 minutes as recommended to climatize to the elevation. I had nothing to drink that day except 1 cup of coffee in the AM, and a few liters of water at the beach during the day. 

After our 30 minutes we started driving up to the 14k foot summit. I made it to 13k feet before shit hit the fan. 

It started with me feeling tingly in the face and hands. A dive (not in the last few months though), and thought it could be a lack of O2, so did a breathing technique where I exhale as much as I could, and then try and force myself to cough to release all the CO2 I can. After doing that a few times I completely lost control of my breathing. I started hyperventilating and my my muscles locked up. My hands were stuck my legs were stuck I got really dizzy, couldn't breath and could barely open my eyes. Thankfully it wasn't me driving. The driver immediately turned around and got us to the visitor center. The park rangers first aid attendant called an ambulance and walked me through breathing and helping me relax. 

Blood pressure was crazy high, 190/100 but my O2 saturation was high, showing 99, then 98, and after about 10 minutes got to 95. That's when things normalized. 

After that time frame I went from having no control over my body, and struggling to breath to feeling almost totally fine. 

Today I feel fatigued. I'm opting out of snorkeling, and just chilling by the pool in shade for the day. 

My theory is that something went wrong with my CO2 at the high elevation. My breathing tequniqe that helps me hold my breath while free diving earlier that week, must have thrown something out of what and made me have a panic attack. 

I am hoping maybe someone can help me understand what I did wrong or what happened to me. 

I work in law enforcement and am considered a very competent and in control person under stress. I just want to know this isn't a normal thing.

It's not as bad as it might sound, everyday I wake up, I put myself together in the usual suit and tie. I commute to work, where I work a standard office job and hope that today won't be more data entry. (It always is.) I come home, take a shower and the rest of my day belongs to me. I think the worst part is always the commute, you have to be vigilant and if you see anything odd, you have to pay attention to it. 

I've had a few days over the weekend to collect myself but I can't sit back and pretend these out of towners don't bother me anymore. You see a sign, you listen to the sign, how is that so damn hard for people? I suppose that I should get on with things and issue my cautionary tale. If for some reason the guy in the black sedan is reading this, hello again. Please never drive through again.

The day started like any other, I woke up, got ready, poured a cup of coffee and got on my way to work. Hitting the main road I was quickly met with two things, one, a brand new road sign off 3 rd street that said “If you see it - Don't make eye contact.” In white reflective letters complete with a little silhouette of an eyeball. This is just how you know the rules that day, no one ever puts these signs up and it's not always an actual sign but there's always something like it around. So I slowed down and started to pay attention to anything out of the ordinary. 

That's when I was met with the second thing, a black sedan that refused to get off my bumper and made it well known he was unhappy that I was going 10 miles under the speed limit. It was clear he was from out of town and that he probably hadn't even seen the sign. I rolled my eyes and went about my business.

We rode like this for a good 10 to 15 minutes before I suddenly stopped, “Don't make eye contact.” Felt like an understatement when out of the corner of my eye I could see an eyeball floating through the fog, and getting ready to pass through the road. So I carefully busied myself pretending something had fallen down by my passenger seat, stealing half glances as the large eye stared down my car. 

Honk! Honk!

The man behind me must not have seen it, I saw the eye twitch white, it must have been looking back toward him.

Hoooooooooooooo-!

He leaned on the horn, the eye disappeared and all at once the honking stopped. 

I could have left. I should have left. People drive through here everyday, ignore warnings and only God knows what happens to them then. But he was right there and before I knew it I was on my way out the car door. In long, panicked strides I walked over to the car window and began beating on the window. When that didn't work, I started beating on the windshield.

“HEY! You got a fuckin’ problem buddy! You fuckin’ look at me when I'm talking!”

I couldn't come out and say it, not with that thing right over both of us but if I could keep his attention, just maybe things would be okay. And as the man rolled his window down, I tried so hard not to be relieved. I turned every inch of fear and panic into anger  and began my own road rage against the man.

“Didn't you see the sign asshole! It's 35 through here!” I shouted at the top of my lungs, I honestly didn't have much to be angry at but had to keep it going. Pretending that I didn't see it. I saw his eyes dart back to the eye and smacked my hand into the windshield once more. “HEY! You look at me when I'm talking!”

I like to think that at that moment we both came to an understanding that I was just as scared as he was, that I knew what I was doing, and that if he listened to me, it would all go away. I had no idea if things would be okay but maybe by following the letter of the warning we could get out of this. 

“It's bad enough I have to make my way to the same shitty job every fucking day without morons like you on the roads! Now I gotta deal with my boss being a fucking asshole over me being late!” And so I screamed at this random man. I started with traffic and moved into work as I could feel the humidity over my shoulder change, the man in front of me with tears welling up in his eyes and I knew. It was right there, it was waiting and it knew that I knew it.

“Don't start fucking crying now! You started this asshole!”

It had to be inches away from me just waiting for us to give up the act and look at it. So I kept going, this man became my personal therapist as I screamed about my life. My job slowly faded into my personal life and when I ran out of things to shout about there I'd just change the topic again, and again, and again. As time went by and people in the town understood, they would simply go around our cars and we would keep pretending that this was normal.

I was there for 3 hours before I could say it had left. I can tell you it was 3 hours because when I arrived at work, I was quickly called into the boss's office for being 3 hours late and when he finally looked at me, I was a disheveled husk of a man. My hair going in wild directions, suit creased and sweat stains all along my shirt. My face worn and tired as I had just been through a great ordeal, all he could ask was.

“What happened?” 

Worry creasing his brow, he wasn't looking for answers for my sake but his own. Hoping that maybe he could avoid this. I sat down in the only available chair and I wept. I could not answer his question but in that moment it truly hit me that it was over and in my relief all I could do was cry. I sat in that office, my boss half-heartedly comforting me, my throat rough and my cry barely a whisper until he told me that I was free to go home. 

The very next day, driving through on my way to work yet again, I saw the same sign post with a black trash bag over the sign and I know that when I drive through tomorrow the sign will be completely gone. It's the only way to truly know that whatever strangeness has passed. ",2,1743885921.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I have a mhw3bomber sniper grinder, as you can see in the video the main centeral shaft is wobbly and not straight, I think it is a common problem among snipers as you can see in hoons coffee review, I have contacted them through IG and their website but they kept telling me that I should go to local retail for repair that such a thing doesn't happen, I've opened my unit and the main problem was where the main shaft attached to the main shaft of gearbox, and it's a manufacturing error (I assume not specific to my unit) 
So my question is:
1. Is it going to produce more fines and affect the taste?
2. Should I fix it in some way, or leave it as it is?
3. Anyone else have the same issue? And any solutions? 
Thanks 🌷

Seems like a relaxing place. Enjoy the malls, halal food, coffee shops, skyline, beaches, Islamic and Arabic cultures and above all safe.

But just looking at the tickets, a family of 5 will easily spend $8K to $10K on airline tickets alone. And that is in economy. Families can only visit when school is out, so either summer break or winter break. Summer is insanely hot, so that leaves winter break only. 

So spend $10K on tickets, and then hotel + food + activities. I am looking at $15K to $20K total. But I am going to spend $0 in Qatar if I don't go to there and instead go to Dubai or Istanbul (which most people consider a better value) 

So who is the tourism aimed at?

I am sure the answer is LOL BRO THEY WANT P30PL3 WHO ARRIVE IN FIRST CLASS AND DROP $5000 PER NIGHT ON RITZ CARLTON AND $500 STEAKS. Take yo p00r family home and visit San Antonio or something.

In my opinion, Qatar should subsidize tickets for visitors coming to Qatar. Tickets in summer should cost $500 per passenger, and in winter they should cost at most $1000. Get the people in, and let them spend. I can see people going to Qatar if the ticket prices are low. ",3,1743885607.0,qatar,10,0.72,False

She treats her husband terribly, calls him lazy, fat, stupid etc. She is constantly on his case, even though he is at retirement age and works a full time job. Nothing he does is good enough, and she expects him to even walk the dogs she wanted, when he gets home in the evening (she is retired at home all day). 

Recently I met her for coffee, she was in one of her rages. Everything I said, she shouted that she didn't understand what I was saying, even though it was part of the conversation. She is utterly obsessed with my sister and her daughter and tries to control everything with fear/anxiety. Like my sister was going to pick up a car and she ranted for half an hour to me that it's not safe to drive in rush hour!

For context, my bf is taking a trip out of state for a week and it seems to have trigger something from my abandonment issues. We’ve had struggles in our relationship because of my BPD, me denying that i have it, my actions/words i’ve made whenever i split, etc. i’m currently accepting that i do in fact have BPD and it’s something that i can manage and work with instead of working against it. i’ve also understood the fact that i’ve hurt my partner with my words and actions and really do want to change for myself, him, and overall for the better. 

i’m hopeful that this time apart will help me if i really do set my mind on fixing things, but i first want to get over the hurdle of knowing that im going to be alone for a while, even if i can’t bare it. any advice on how to manage this loneliness in a healthy way? 
i’ve had a tendency on doing impulsive and risky decisions whenever im alone just to ignore it (drinking, partying, one night stands, etc). obviously i don’t want to fall into the same pattern, but i don’t know the healthy alternatives for them. 

if it helps, i’m actually not a social person at all LOL i really do enjoy staying at home. i like to bake, but just recently made brownies last night and i’m trying to figure out how to finish them 😭 i don’t have friends other than my bf, siblings, and my mom. i have acquaintances but im not entirely close to them to be able to call them my friends. i like going out on my own for a cup of coffee, but i think im more so looking for advice during the times i don’t have anything to do to distract myself (laundry, work, etc).
i don’t know what to do during the times where ill miss him the most, like when its time to go to bed, or having to make meals for one instead of two.

any advice will be appreciated sincerely. this isn’t the first time he’s left out of state, so i know ill be okay. it just doesn’t feel any easier no matter how many times. going to try to watch some hell’s kitchen in the meantime! thanks again <3",1,1743885103.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

We were in a very toxic cycle of emotions, avoiding and just bad at communicating and I was so anxious. We planned our entire lives together and even talked about business.. we broke up due to him going back home, that was the icing on the cake our issues. He sucked at keeping his word and making me feel important but I didn’t see the times he did both things. He always thought I was complaining when I just wanted to fix our problems. I feel like he didn’t notice what I did for him either, he could’ve turned his whole life upside down for me but I didn’t let him because I loved him and could wait until the time was right. Well now, 5 months later, I’m missing him. I want our connection, our memories, our jokes, our laughs, our plans, our future life and kids. We don’t communicate at all but I know I can call him if I ever wanted to as I did before and he answered and we talked. 
I need help because I really don’t want anyone else but met this guy at coffee shop about 1 1/2 month ago and he treats me like a queen. He does everything he says and stuff to make me feel special without me even asking but I can’t help but wish it was my ex… 
I feel so sad, confused and empty. I’m scared I may hurt this new guy and leave and I did tell him I’m scared of emotions, scared of it all and I might run. 
He’s so sweet, we are literally going to NY tmr while I had to beg my ex to go somewhere with me even when he brought it up , even when I said I’ll help pay.. we didn’t go on our first trip until 5 months before our break up. He always made plans with me like Halloween but then would ditch me for his friends. 
Why do I miss him? Why do I want it to be him? Why can’t I get over this? I really want to die. I feel so unworthy of love, love that fulfilled me. Neither of us were perfect and I think we overlooked how much we actually did for each other and now, we aren’t together. 
I think it’s for the best but I can’t help but feel like our time isn’t over yet…

My current favorites: Pumpkin Pie Spectacular, Blueberry Muffin, Black Chocolate, Pumpkin Kiss, Cinderella's Carriage\* (potentially, I think it may be going slightly plastic-ey on me? But I love the concept).

And the ones that did not work for me: Valentine's Day Carnival (too green/bitter), 1518 in Glenfinnan (too much whiskey), Pumpkin Fried Ice Cream (the fried note goes sour on me). 

Notes I like (in general): Pretty much any wood, spice, or nut. Coffee, oats, rice, vanilla, tonka, soft/sweet musks, marshmallow, cake, cream, custard, chocolate. Citrus fruit and berries.

Notes I dislike: Anything fresh, cold, or green. Lavender, lilac, leather, heavy alcohol, figs, dates, tea (besides chai spice), cashmere, beeswax.

so in a months time my youngest son will be turning 1. Culturally, we tend to go an all out to celebrate the 1st year. Now because his birthday will fall in the middle of Autumn, my partner & I have decided to look for pubs which have an indoor play area just incase it rains. We did look at hosting the birthday at children play centres like monkey mania however it was very expensive as from both sides of our family have  30+ children all together and play centres usually charge about $700 for 10 kids with shitty food , a half ass host who would rather do anything else then be there for the 2 hours in the room & every child after the 10th is an and a leg extra. So because the venue is still not decided ,about a week ago I sent out save the date messages just to make sure our families were free. One of these messages was also sent to my mum. My mum & I have a very hot & cold relationship. When we are good , we are great however when we are bad - you know the story . We generally fight like sisters. She can very extremely 2 faced , especially towards her kids (me & my sibling) . About 3 days after she calls me & asks about my sons birthday & venue. It had only been about a day before we decided to most likely have it at this newly built pub as they have a MASSIVE indoor playground & you can book the tables that are in the same room as the playground. I was told to hire any sort of function space the minimum spend is 2 grand. Now please keep in mind the pricing for food and drink at this fancy new pub is in the higher end . So anyways , I let her know that this pub was most likely where we are going to host it , the minimum spend & start time/finish . She then proceeds to ask me about what food options we are buying for everyone. 
So how my man & I have sort of planned it is ,we are going to be paying for kids packs (kids meal, drink , ice cream & lolly bag) & then for the adults, we were looking at getting the platter options which consists of pizzas,pastas,salads , wraps & some hot finger foods like meatballs& spring rolls. That all tallied up to about 1 grand so then I explained to her & for the other grand we were going to be putting a bar tab on . She immediately shut me down & said WHHHYYY ARE YOU PUTTING ALL THAT MONEY BEHIND THE BAR, it’s a child first birthday no one should be drinking . I said YES, I KNOW the bar tab is for jugs of juice , soft drinks, milk shakes , barista made coffees & all that. I also explained this place is pretty pricey so a jug of juice /soft drink alone is $18 & we are having 70 guests ! I did also mention the tab won’t be open to alachol until the final hour (the party is 4 hours long) so if theirs is anything left on the tab , whoever would like a drink could enjoy 1 or 2 . She then tells me instead of putting the money behind the bar , she would rather eat steak & to put steak on the platters . This immediately triggers me because growing up & until tomorrow she will always try to find a way to eat expensively on someone else’s dime / try to manipulate people to use their money on her first before even think about reaching for her card. I said no , it’s finger food only & if she wants to eat steak , BRING HER BIG BACK STEAK MONEY . She continued to yell at me over the phone then said “ so your saying we all have to make our way to the party just to pay for our own meals?” I said there is going to be pizza , pastas , chicken wings & other hot finger foods there but yes if you would like a main meal , you’ll need to pay for it. I felt she was acting as if we’ve invited her to our neighbours child’s birthday- some complete stranger. She then said “ ew how disgusting, I hate pizza & pasta”. I reminded her that she isn’t paying for anything / contributing to anything so your opinion means sweet fuck all. We continue to argue so I ended the call. 
Side note : i have a little sister thats 11 years old that obviously still lives with her. When my aunty stopped by my mums house on a Friday afternoon , my sister was sitting there in the house , by herself , all alone . 
So anyways , after I hang up she proceeds to message me & saying “ wow you’re so rude , your behaviour is unbelievable, please stay away from my daughter (my 11 year old sister) . I don’t want her to turn out like you “ I did message back & remind her that she again isn’t contributing / putting any money in for my sons birthday , so don’t come at me with your “I’d rather eat steak” bullshit & to bring her steak money if that’s what she really wanted . I then messaged her saying “ your daughter was left alone at home yesterday. Maybe she’ll grow up like Casper since that’s who she was there with”  My mum then tried to act confused then said for me to stay away from her. To which I responded NEVVVEEERRRR . She proceeds to call me a dick head & to stay away from her . I responded “ ON MY WAY TO SEE HER RIGHT NOW!” . My mum then responded with telling me to fuck off before she blocked me. 

About a week later , I send out invitations with the venue on it & all those finer details. I send one to my aunty (my mums sister) . She views it & doesn’t respond or react to the post. I then messaged her & said “see you there” to which she responded “we’ll see” . So I call my cousin (her daughter) a few days after that & ask her what’s up . My cousin says her mum has been talking to my mum & doesn’t think it’s worth going if there’s not going to be real food there. My cousin then tells me she called my aunty & mum the big back twins & to stay if there’s the energy she’s bringing. 
Is what I have planned for the adults that disappointing ? 
Would I be the asshole if i retract my invitation from my aunty or should I just make amends with my mum so my little sister can come (she’s still not getting a steak) ",1,1743884532.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

How I Convince My Lazy Ass to Move,"Alright, lazy squad, it’s me—your fellow weekend sloth who somehow manages to convince themselves (occasionally) to put down the snacks and pick up some dumbbells. Weekends are supposed to be for rest, but let’s face it: lying around like a human burrito isn’t exactly doing wonders for our fitness goals.

So here’s how I trick my brain into getting off the couch and staying active on weekends. Spoiler alert: it involves bribery and self-deprecation.

Bribe Yourself with Food

“If I go to the gym, I can eat ALL THE TACOS later.” This is literally my internal dialogue 90% of the time. Guilt-free snacking is the ultimate motivator.

* **Remind Yourself That You’re Old and Fragile Now**
   * “Remember that one time you tried to get up from the couch and almost threw out your back? Yeah, don’t let that happen again. Go move your body, grandma.”
* **Recruit a Gym Buddy (or Accountability Shamer)**
   * Find someone who won’t let you bail. Bonus points if they’ll roast you relentlessly when you try to cancel last minute. “Oh, so you’d rather binge-watch bad TV than crush squats? Cool story, champ.”
* **Set Ridiculously Low Expectations**
   * “I’ll just go for 15 minutes… okay fine, maybe 30… alright FINE, I guess I’ll do an entire workout now.” Sometimes starting small makes the whole thing feel less daunting.
* **Channel Your Inner Athlete (Even If You’re Not One)**
   * Pretend you’re training for the Olympics or something equally ridiculous. Who cares if no one’s watching? You’re a champion in your own mind.
* **Reward Yourself with Something Fun Afterward**
   * Whether it’s buying a fancy coffee, taking a nap, or rewatching your favorite comfort show, give yourself a prize for adulting.

Honestly, I think the hardest part about staying active on weekends is fighting the urge to become one with the couch. 

Any tips for motivating your lazy butt to move on weekends? Or are we all doomed to spend Saturdays horizontal forever? 

TL;DR: Bribe yourself, scare yourself, shame yourself, and reward yourself—all before noon. Repeat weekly until motivated.",1,1743884511.0,FitAfter40,0,1.0,False

but even without coffee I sometimes get really paranoid(which can happen with bpd) that others are watching me or looking at me weird adn theres hidden cameras in places and sometimes possibly hear things(it sounds like a hallucination if i told others but likely not)

im just a hypochondriac and coffee convinces me of worse like possibly dpdr?

so anyone else just self diagnose with things almost but since they aren't a doctor nobody mostly here is they cant obviously say they have it

## The Allure of Cold Brew: Why Bother?

Before diving into the specifics of the KitchenAid cold brew, let's understand why cold brew coffee has captured the hearts (and taste buds) of so many. Unlike customary hot brewing methods, cold brew relies on time, not heat, to extract flavor from coffee grounds. This results in a beverage that's naturally sweeter, less acidic, and incredibly smooth.For those with sensitive stomachs or those who simply prefer a less bitter taste, cold brew is a game-changer. Plus, its concentrated nature allows for versatile dilution, making it perfect for iced coffee, cocktails, or even baking. Making cold brew at home allows for customization of flavor to your specific coffee bean preferences.

## setting Up and Brewing: kitchenaid Cold Brew Instructions

One of the biggest selling points of the KitchenAid cold brew coffee maker is its ease of use. Hear's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Grind Your Coffee:** Use a coarse grind, similar to what you'd use for a French press. This is crucial for preventing over-extraction and a muddy flavor. Start with a coffee bean that you enjoy, as the flavor will only increase with cold brewing methods..
2.  **Fill the Steeper:** Add your ground coffee to the stainless steel steeper. The amount of coffee will depend on your desired concentration, but a general rule of thumb is a 1:8 coffee-to-water ratio.
3.  **add Water:** Slowly pour cold, filtered water over the coffee grounds in the steeper. Ensure all the grounds are saturated.
4.  **Steep:** Place the steeper filled with grounds and water into the glass carafe. Cover and refrigerate for 12-24 hours. The longer you steep, the stronger the concentrate will be. Experiment to find your sweet spot.
5.  **Dispense and Enjoy:** After steeping, remove the steeper. Your cold brew concentrate is now ready to enjoy. Use the tap to dispense the concentrate and dilute with water, milk, or your favorite mixer to taste.

## The Taste Test: Is the KitchenAid Cold Brew Worth It?

The ultimate test of any coffee maker is the taste of the coffee it produces.The KitchenAid cold brew consistently delivers a smooth, balanced, and flavorful concentrate. The lack of acidity is noticeable, making it easy on the stomach. While taste is subjective, the consensus is that this maker produces a high-quality cold brew concentrate that's superior to many store-bought options. The quality of your coffee bean itself, in addition to brew time, both factor into to the ultimate taste of your cold brew.

The market for Cold Brew Coffee Makers is vast and there are other options out there. The KitchenAid Cold Brew Coffee maker holds its own against competitors. Here's how it stacks up:

* **Compared to Oxo:** Oxo is known for user-friendly design. While that's definitely one of the attributes of the KitchenAid device, it can fall short in regard to cleaning when compared to the oxo.
* **Compared to Toddy Cold Brew System:** The Toddy system has a higher volume. So if you're looking to produce mass quantities, the Toddy cold brew system might work for you. The downside of the Toddy Cold Brew System is that it takes up more space.
* **KitchenAid Cold Brew vs French Press:** Using a French Press to make cold brew can be done,but the mess and sediment that remain are not ideal. The KitchenAid system is far simpler, with a built in filter system.

1jscmjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1jscmjp/aitj_for_my_friend_almost_getting_fired/,AITJ for my friend almost getting fired,"I (24M) work at a corporate company at a 9-5. I just graduated college last year and started this job 2 weeks after graduating around June. It’s an internship at a solid company that’s going to help me get better jobs and opportunities later on. In the beginning everything was going great and I made several friends including Chelsea (26F). Chelsea has been my friend since the beginning and we share everything with each other and often go out for coffee and lunch. Just a side note - nothing romantic or sexual between us at all. It’s completely platonic. 

The problem started in November when I got transitioned to a different department under a manager named Ryan (43M). Ryan definetly has a narcissistic personality and loves getting his ego fed. This is pretty well known throughout the office. Ryan loves ragging on the “new guy” and since I’ve been the new guy since November, I’ve been the one who’s getting the brunt of it. Now I have a pretty thick skin so I don’t get bothered by it easily. Ryan noticed this and started really cracking down and started embarrassing me in meetings and giving me busy work so that I have less time to do the real work. After 6 weeks of dealing with Ryan I started looking for new jobs around December. After a long process of job hunting, I got an incredible offer in the beginning of March, but the problem is that my new job doesn’t start until June. Obviously I need to pay the bills so I’m stuck working with Ryan for another 2 months. Since my current job only requires me to give 2 weeks professional notice I decided I’m not gonna inform them until the end of May which is right at the 2 week mark. Until then I’m just playing nice and making sure no issues happen so that Ryan doesn’t try to sabotage my new job. 

Ok, so getting back to Chelsea. Chelsea doesn’t work directly under Ryan but works in an adjacent department so she knows Ryan pretty well. Chelsea is also the only one who knows about my new job. Chelsea has been pressuring me to go to HR about Ryan’s behavior. But I’ve told her than I don’t want any problems and that I’m not going to go to HR. I just want the next two month to go by smoothly and get out of here. Well the other day Chelsea and I were hanging out in her office and Ryan comes in. For the purpose of being anonymous, I’m not going to say what happened next. However, Ryan did something to me that was definetly a fireable offense. 

After that happened, Chelsea told me I HAVE to report Ryan. But I said no and just left. Well it turns out that Chelsea took it upon herself to go to HR directly. HR called me into their office and asked me for my side of the story. I straight up lied and told them nothing happened. HR dropped the issue but word got around and Ryan found out about it. Now he’s trying to go after Chelsea and get her fired for being a “liar”. 

Now Chelsea is mad at me and won’t talk to me. She’s blaming me for her almost getting fired. But it’s MY prerogative whether or not I decide to report. I understand that she thinks that me letting it slide means that it will affect other people too but, to be completely honest, I’m looking out for me and what’s best for my future.

This makes it the worst two days on Wall Street since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stocks dropped almost six percent Friday.

This comes after President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on Wednesday, which sparked a global trade war. JP Morgan is now saying there is about a 60% chance of recession.

Around the globe, some countries slapped the United States with retaliatory tariffs. China is one of the first nations to hit back.

Some nations are pondering their next move, including U.S. allies Canada and the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile, businesses across Louisiana are scrambling and trying to figure out just how much these tariffs will cost them, and how that will impact consumers.

That includes Port NOLA, a huge transportation Hub in New Orleans. It could affect everything from cars to our local coffee industry.

WDSU Reporter Shay O'Connor reached out to Port NOLA who are currently trying to familiarize themselves with new trade policies. They released this statement:

""We are closely monitoring this very dynamic situation. We will continue to work with our customers and partners on adapting to market changes and meeting their supply chain needs.""

This, as many other industries are bracing for the impact of upcoming tariffs, including our local coffee industry, which is getting ready for possible price hikes. Owners with Orleans Coffee roast specialty beans. The beans are mostly imported from places like Brazil, East Africa and several locations in South America.

Bob Arceneaux said paying more for his imports means he will likely have to charge 10% more to his customers. He said he is just trying to stay afloat financially.

Arceneaux said, ""We have never paid this much for coffee. In the 40-plus years of our business. We are all just waiting for the market to come down so we can get some relief.""

Many business owners we have spoken with all week said they will try to absorb as much of the cost as they can, but there's only so much they can do.",21,1743884093.0,NewOrleans,2,0.87,False

1jscg00,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jscg00/my_experience_dating_over_the_last_4_years_30m/,My experience dating over the last 4 years (30M),"I lurk a lot of the dating subs- this is my experience dating the last few years. Some themes and advice you may recognize, others may go against the consensus. I hope it gives some people the recognition and validation of what they're see or could help your approach with dating.

I live in a mid-sized east coast city. I have a steady white collar career and work from home. I own my home- it's a little messy but I'm proud of it. I have a great social life and I enjoy my friends and hobbies. I think I'm fairly conventionally attractive and I see about \~25 people a year, almost exclusively from Hinge. Here's what I've noticed.

* Dumbest ""shoot yourself in foot"" mistake I see people make on profiles is every photo featuring sunglasses or a friend. I've seen plenty of seemingly attractive profiles make this error.
* I generally always ask for a number. I understand some women don't feel comfortable with that- however, I've been unmatched with 5 minutes before a date before multiple times. A number means there's more skin in the game from the other party.
* I've been on at least 70 first dates since I last became single in 2020- despite the reps. I always get the same butterflies and nervousness before every date. Frequency hasn't helped. I guess it's good that I still feel emotions? 
* Drinks is the first date gold standard. I've tried alternatives, coffee, ice cream, cutesy walks... nothing compares to the tone and lowering of inhibitions that drinks at the bar set. I've stopped trying to reinvent the wheel.
* Guys- something that has helped me is finding a light cologne. Do not douse yourself. A pump on the chest and each wrist before I put a shirt on. Women always mention that I smell nice after successful dates. To quote a wise man- the first hole you enter in a woman is her nose. 
* A kiss to cap off the date doesn't guarantee another, but no kiss generally is a terrible sign. I read a lot of people in dating subs say that this is not important, but my experience runs contra to this. I don't ask- generally her body language will let me know if she wants to be kissed or not.
* The most reliable barometer of gauging interest is texting frequency and length. She will work hard to make conversation if she's into it.
* Dating is generally fun. having a crush and texting a crush is a great feeling.
* Second dates are my chokepoint. I see about 20% of my first dates more than once- it is what it is. Some were simply \*not matches\* and it is fine. A hot take I have is that if it's obvious there's no chemistry- ghosting is fine. Most other dates filter into a mushy middle where the connection wasn't perfect, but it was enjoyable. Enjoyable is not good enough however- it never is. Accordingly, I have never gotten a second date I was surprised to hear back from. There is no ""growing into attraction"" from my experience 
* For second dates, I usually invite them to my house for a dinner. I definitely judge the situation and if I don't feel like we've reached a certain closeness, I'll hold that off for the third date.
* To link to the above comment, I feel like I have almost no margin for error. It feels like it just takes one silence, on flat joke, one misjudged arm touch to sink the whole enterprise. A woman would rather see what the next match is up to rather than giving you benefit of the doubt. 
* For the folks I see for longer- sex usually happens by the second date, if not the first. I maintain a flexible approach to this- happy to be patient- this is just what happens.
* I think people become really uncomfortable making the next step after date 5+, and ironically, I see it the most in liberal women that have plenty of war stories about the anxiously attached. This is my cap- something always inevitably happens around this 1-2 month, date 5-10 period, that derails things. 

  
To cap off, I'm having fun, but there are plenty of faults in the system. I think people overrate the possibility of finding ""the one"" and underrate the possibility of spending years and years alone letting great partners go because they aren't perfect, and this informs a lot of thinking. I see it in myself sometimes and it's something I try to mitigate. It's the apps. None of these are new observations. It's funny- I will see the same profiles, the same ""most compatible of the day"" selections, sometimes it's people I've swiped on, occasionally it's people I already dated, as the years pass, and I think, are we all doomed to be on this same ship?
