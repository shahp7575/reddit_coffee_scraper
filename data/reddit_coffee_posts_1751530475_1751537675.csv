I’m not interested in just exchanging a couple of polite messages and fading into the void. I’m looking to genuinely connect, especially with people who feel a little out of step with the expected.

Maybe you're an expat with a strange hobby, someone who reads obscure history for fun, or a creative soul who feels most alive at 2 AM. Maybe you're just someone who doesn’t quite fit the mainstream mold, that’s a plus in my book.

I’m based in Abu Dhabi and would love to meet people for real conversation — the kind that wanders, questions things, and isn’t afraid of silence or absurdity.

Some things I’m into lately:
• Wandering aimlessly in unfamiliar neighborhoods
• Coffee that turns into conversations that turn into rabbit holes
• Niche music genres and underrated movies
• Random facts, speculative fiction, and ideas that don’t always go anywhere but are fun to think about

Whether you’re passing through, newly arrived, or just tired of surface-level chats, feel free to comment or DM. Not trying to build a crowd, just a few real connections.

1lqlucs,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1lqlucs/omad_and_aging_or_at_least_being_middle_aged/,OMAD and aging (or at least being middle aged),"M, 49.

I wanted to share my OMAD journey as I approach my 50th birthday. About two years ago I went for an executive health check and got flagged for fatty liver. I was around 90+ kilos at 179 cms, drifting steadily in the wrong direction. I do the occasional running and lifting and always thought it would cancel out the whatever bad habits (or just habits) but deep down I think I knew I was kidding myself.

The truth is I was still eating and drinking like I was 25 and thinking I could just man up and run it off the next day. But as you get older your metabolism simply does not play along like it used to. My BMR is not what it was in my twenties and exercise alone cannot cover for it anymore.

Switching to OMAD was the biggest shift I made. For me it is not about chasing magical fasting benefits. It is about putting a clear boundary around my daily calories. One meal keeps me honest. No endless snacking. No lunch that makes me sluggish. Just one proper meal in the evening that also doubles as the family meal which makes it feel like an occasion rather than just another refuel stop.

When I started, the first three weeks were rough. I would come home after work in a daze, ready to inhale anything in sight. I would eat like a beast just to feel normal again. But bit by bit my body adjusted. The hunger pangs faded and I realised how much of what I thought was hunger was just a habit or a feeling.

These days I feel sharper and steadier than I did ten years ago. I have more mental space and more energy. My daily routine feels simpler. I am not grazing through the day or reaching for a sugar hit to push through the afternoon. I am more productive and focused. My work involves managing large teams in a global org so my days demand a lot of me. I have become a better professional and manager. Maybe even a better parent and husband.

I run or ruck most mornings, lift a bit when I can, and pay more attention to my recovery than I ever did before. My Garmin watch has become my guide. I look at my sleep, HRV, VO2 max, resting heart rate and daily load so I know when to push and when to pull back. My VO2 max is 50 now which is pretty solid for my age group. My resting heart rate sits around 50 beats per minute and I burn between 2200 and 2500 calories a day depending on training. My daily intake stays around 1500 to 1800 calories so the fat keeps shifting slowly but steadily.

My protein goal is around 120 grams a day. I usually have beef protein with water as a shake when I got home, and before dinner, to break my fast. Sometimes I mix it in with Greek yoghurt and some mixed nuts. As for dinner, I eat mostly clean, try to limit carbs, focus on vegetables and lean protein. Can be anything from chicken soup to steak to lentils. Sometimes some dark chocolate for desert. Window I try to keep to 2-1 hours.

My morning stack is black coffee with creatine before training, soda water with electrolytes, BCAAs, apple cider vinegar (just a splash to settle my gut) and a pinch of salt. I also take L-carnitine, zinc, cod liver oil, phosphatidylserine and tart cherry extract. In the evenings I have magnesium, ashwagandha, l theanine, saffron extract and tart cherry again, all to help switch off and recover properly.

I've got an impedance scale but apart from weight it just throws out guesses, like body fat at 16%. So I booked a DEXA scan to get real numbers. Turns out my scale was off by an order of magnitude. My actual body fat is about 22%. I plan to check again in six months to keep myself honest.

I've done 4 longer water fasts too, always 5 days, usually after holidays when family time means big meals and more drinks. These days I aim for a 5 day fast about once a quarter but only if life allows it. I never force it.

Weekends I relax it a bit. If we are out for lunch I will eat. OMAD is not a prison sentence. I hav cut back alcohol a lot but still enjoy a glass of wine a few times a month. Now and then there is a party and I have more but that is rare.

The main thing for me is that I feel clearer, fitter and stronger now than I did ten years ago. OMAD has given me back control over my intake and my time. It has made space in my day for better sleep, better training and just feeling present for my family.

If anyone reading this is feeling stuck or drifting like I was, maybe this helps you see OMAD for what it really is: a tool for discipline and simplicity that works with you as you get older and your body changes. It is not magic but it works with normal life (for all of life) as opposed to most diets. And for me that is the reason. Add baseline data through a Dexa scan if the mirror isn't enough (and throw out the impedance scale) - the visceral fat you can't see and that is what will give you fatty liver syndrome and other issues. Also get a reading on your day-to-day stats using an Apple Watch or Garmin and track recovery as religiously as you track performance, even if you just aim to increase your daily step count. HRV and resting HR are key metrics for how your body is doing. Don't just go on the mirror.",1,1751537355.0,omad,0,1.0,False

Sidenote on things to consider: 
I am on ashwagandha which lowers my stress levels. I ordered 5-htp in case I would feel depressed but haven't felt the need for it. I also have seroquel for panic attacks but I haven't felt the need for it either. 

My main reason to quit was the numbness and low energy levels. Nicotine made me not feel physical (including hunger) or mental pain, nor did it make me feel happiness, motivation or excitement. INCLUDING LOW SEX DRIVE. Hell no, nothing is worth that. 

I was also on my period when I quit, which historically boosts my confidence and makes me feel unstoppable. BUT NOT ON NICOTINE! Though I suspect under the numbing effect from nicotine that boost in fighting spirit in my body is still there, which may have made withdrawals easier. 

-----

Day 1: felt dizzy but super energetic and active to the point of moving around till I physically couldn't anymore, slept 2hrs. 

Day 2: PAIN from moving around so much the previous day. But the pain didn't deter me from wanting to move around and I couldn't stay still the whole day. Despite feeling so energetic my reaction time was BAD and I didn't move fast at all. (This was easily proven by engaging in a water fight with my niece) Felt like a sloth on uppers. I lowkey felt manic when it came to my mood, switching from blood hungry irritation to happy go lucky and excited. Slept 3hrs but forced myself to stay in bed and managed to sleep an hour at a time. Whole night had a super stiff neck that made me wake up feeling annoyed.

12 hours into day 3: I feel ""normal"". No dizzyness, no manic energy levels (yet), no brain fog. Did wake up to lesions on my gums though which is annoying, since I should avoid drinking coffee but I need SOMETHING for the adhd I'm raw dogging.

-----

People say the first 3 days are the worst, so not having it be bad makes me think it's gonna get worse and I'll get struck down by a mega flu or something. fingers crossed that's not the case (though literally who cares about a damn flu when it comes to doing something beneficial for your health long term)

All in all not a bad time at all. Kinda like a hypomania light if you will. So if anyone's scared about the first 3 days, don't be. These 3 days have been more fun and enjoyable than the last six months honestly. Will update if I get struck by a lightning or the plague. ",1,1751537268.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False
1lqlso5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GatoInary/comments/1lqlso5/how_to_choose_the_best_visual_novel_engine_from/,How to Choose the Best Visual Novel Engine: From Narrative Writer to Pro Developer (Without Losing Your Sanity),"In the world of visual novels, the main question isn’t just “who killed the protagonist?” but also “which engine should I use so my story doesn’t kill me in the process?” Let’s break down which engine is best for a narrative writer, what an ambitious game designer might prefer, and what will make a true developer’s heart sing—with a dose of professional humor and zero headaches.

# For Narrative Writers: Ren’Py – “Write Like You Breathe”

If your strength is crafting dialogue, not debugging code, Ren’Py is your best friend.

* **Pros:**
   * Coding is almost optional—just write your story and let the engine work its magic.
   * More tutorials than Netflix has series.
   * Free, cross-platform, and even your cat could figure it out.
* **Cons:**
   * Want something fancier than “click to continue”? Time to learn Python (or invite a programmer friend for coffee).
   * Complex animations? Only for the patient—or those who love to Google.

# For Ambitious Game Designers: Godot – “Freedom, Baby!”

Love experimenting and not afraid your project might suddenly become a platformer? Welcome to Godot!

* **Pros:**
   * Open source—you can tinker forever (and then some).
   * Great for 2D, easy to add minigames and animations.
   * Free, and no one will ever force you to buy a Pro version.
* **Cons:**
   * Fewer ready-made templates for visual novels than there are weekends in November.
   * Sometimes tech support is just you, your cat, and a forum.

# For Developers: Unity – “When You Want Your Visual Novel to Run on a Fridge”

Dreaming of a visual novel with VR, 3D, minigames, and physics like an AAA action game? Unity is waiting for you.

* **Pros:**
   * Powerful tools, support for everything (maybe even toasters).
   * Easy to integrate complex mechanics and monetization.
   * Huge community and tons of plugins.
* **Cons:**
   * The learning curve is steeper than Ren’Py or Godot—stock up on coffee and patience.
   * Sometimes the engine crashes as suddenly as your motivation on a Monday morning.

# What About You?

1lqlrts,https://i.redd.it/1860e9a0vmaf1.jpeg,Ranking Kof games By voice acting,"15. KOF '94 (The Static Age)
The Game: Where it all started! Voices sounded like they were recorded through a tin can connected to Tokyo by string.
Worst Voice: Kyo. ""YAH YAH YAH OWAAAGHHHH!"" Bro sounded less like a fiery hero, more like someone stubbing their toe mid-sentence. Every. Single. Time.
Best Voice: Rugal. Pure, unadulterated menace. ""GENOCIDE CUTTAH!"" sounded like he meant it. Dude chewed the scenery and spat out diamonds. The only thing not muffled was his ego.
14. KOF '95 (Slightly Less Static, Still Pretty Static)
The Game: Mostly recycled '94 sounds, but hey, new blood!
Worst Voice: Robert. That divekick noise? Pure, uncut gibberish. Sounded like he was trying to swallow his own tongue mid-air. MK1 levels of ""WTF did he just say?!""
Best Voice: Iori. Okay, not his peak performance, but compared to the Kyo-Robert noise pollution? That raspy growl was a breath of smoky, murderous fresh air. ""Aragane!""
13. KOF 2001 (The Great Muffling)
The Game: Everything sounds like it's underwater. In a basement. During a power outage. Even the music phoned it in.
Worst Voice: Heidern. Normally cool and collected, here he sounded... confused? Off-key? Like he forgot why he was even angry? Just off.
Best Voice: Igniz. HOLY CRAP. This poor actor was handed a script full of god-complex nonsense and recorded it in a potato sack, yet somehow delivered pure, silky, arrogant perfection. Made a forgettable boss memorable. Salute!
12. KOF 2003 (The Experimental Phase... It Didn't All Work)
The Game: Trying new things! Some landed like a graceful hop, others like a faceplant.
Worst Voice: Mukai. Dude's supposed to be a primal earth god! Instead, he sounded like a bored accountant. Needed WAY more savage roar, less ""meh.""
Best Voice: Maki & Chizuru (The Duo Boss). Okay, technically not one, but they were a package deal of creepy perfection. Hypnotic, unsettling, perfectly evil Chizuru vibes. Mesmerizing in the best/worst way.
11. KOF XIV (The New Kids on the Block... Mic Check, One Two?)
The Game: Fresh faces! They tried! Bless their hearts. A solid ""first day on the job.""
Worst Voice: Sylvie. Imagine a hyperactive squirrel hooked up to a car battery, fed pure sugar, and told to ""be cute."" Yeah. Annoying doesn't cover it. Like nails on a chalkboard dipped in glitter.
Best Voice: Antonov. ""I AM PRESIDENT!"" The man understood the assignment. Loud, proud, boisterous, and his voice hit like a damn freight train. Pure charisma in vocal form. YOU WIN!
10. KOF 2002 (The Recycled Samples Blues)
The Game: Took the muffled mess of 2001 and said, ""Yeah, run it back!"" Some voices hadn't changed since the 90s (looking at you, Takuma).
Worst Voice: The New Face Team (Yashiro, Shermie, Chris). Oof. Compared to their '97 glory? Shermie sounded like a ditzy valley girl, not a seductive master manipulator. Yashiro lacked swagger, Chris lacked creepy innocence. A collective downgrade. ""We sound... weird?""
Best Voice: Kusanagi. Pure, unfiltered rage. Angry Kyo Best Kyo. ""OROCHI!!!!"" Honorable Mention: Rugal (Cell Voice Actor). Smooth, menacing, powerful. ""You dare challenge me?!"" Chills. Almost made you forget the audio quality.
9. KOF '96 (OST GOAT, Voices... Climbing the Ladder)
The Game: Peacock feathers, amazing tunes, series evolution! Voices? Better than '95, but still finding their footing.
Worst Voice: Leona. The... moaning. Seriously, SNK? Every move sounded like a bad porno outtake. Made fighting her incredibly awkward.  Dude, stop.
Best Voice: Goenitz. ""REPENT!"" This dude sounded like the voice of God Himself decided to smite you personally. Commanding, deep, terrifying. Perfect for the High Priest of Nope.
8. KOF 2000 (The ""End"" with Solid Grunts)
The Game: The supposed finale. Voices mostly solid '98-era stuff, with some nice tweaks
.Best Voice: Kyo (Raw Power) & Striker Shermie (That Laugh!). Kyo sounded fierce and intense. Shermie's striker laugh?  Pure, unadulterated sadistic joy. Said more about her character than any line.
Worst Voice: Takuma. Picking nits here! He wasn't bad, just... exactly the same as '98. Dude needed a new yell or something. ""Rising TACO!"" ...wait.
7. KOF XV (The New Guard Levels Up!)
The Game: VAST improvement over XIV! Guess doing KOF All Stars was like vocal boot camp. They sound comfortable, confident.
Best Voice: B. Jenet. You can hear the actor grinning ear-to-ear. Pure swashbuckling fun, dripping with personality. GOODNIGHHHH
Worst Voice: Kyo. My man sounds like he just took  a nap and couldn't be bothered. Where's the fire?! The passion?! Sounds like he's ordering coffee, not fighting for the fate of the world. ""Meh... Orochi I guess.""
6. KOF '99 (Old Reliables & New Screams)
The Game: Solid '98 foundation, some great new additions.
Best Voice: Kyo. Peak pissed-off Kyo. Sounded like he wanted to murder the entire NESTS cartel personally.  delivered with maximum venom.
Worst Voice: Whip. ""HAAAA HAAAA HAAAA HAAAA HAAAA!"" It never. Stopped. Sounded less like a battle cry, more like she was hyperventilating after running a marathon. Annoying as hell.
5. KOF XI (Shaking Things Up, Vocally)
The Game: Took some swings! Most connected.
Best Voice: Oswald. Cool. Calm. Collected. Utterly lethal. That smooth, deep voice was the character. ""Checkmate."" Perfection.
Worst Voice: Magaki. Okay, maybe nitpicking. Dude sounded weird... but he is a weird teleporting space creep. Just didn't quite land the unsettling vibe he needed. Sounded more like a grouchy hermit.
4. KOF XII (The Pretty But Empty One... With Good Yells?)
The Game: Yeah, yeah, we know. BUT... the voices? Actually pretty damn good! A glimpse of XIII's glory.
Worst Voice: Mature. Just... didn't have the impact. Needed more sultry menace, less... generic villainess?
Best Voice: Shen Woo. ""DORYAAAAAAAA!"" That's the stuff! Pure, raw fighting spirit. One yell said it all. Made you wanna punch a mountain.
3. KOF '97 (The Grunt Heard 'Round the World... Because No Music)
The Game: Iconic story, TERRIBLE in-game music (mostly silent). You heard EVERY grunt, yell, and gasp. Thankfully, the VAs brought their A-game.
Best Voice: The New Face Team (Yashiro, Shermie, Chris). THIS was their PEAK! Yashiro's cocky swagger, Shermie's seductive menace, Chris's terrifyingly innocent creepiness. PERFECT. Iconic.
Worst Voice: Choi. In a game packed with bangers, the average stands out. Still decently annoying, just not legendarily annoying. ""akiiiiiiiii!"" Meh.
2. KOF '98 (The Dream Match Audio Upgrade)
The Game: '97's voice glory, but MORE! Louder! Clearer! With extra sprinkles!
Best Voice: Rugal. The OG menace returned! Utterly sadistic, loving every second of crushing you. HAH AHAHAHAHAHAH
 Honorable Mention: Iori. The definitive raspy, feral perfection.
Worst Voice: Athena. DEAR GOD  HAVE MERCY , make it STOP! That high-pitched squeak wasn't ""kawaii,"" it was a biological weapon designed to liquefy eardrums. ""PSYCHO BALL!"" [Internal Screaming].
1. KOF XIII (The Mic-Drop Finale)
The Game: The old guard's last stand. They knew it. They felt it. THEY ABSOLUTELY NAILED IT.
Best Voice: The Legends (Mr. Karate / EX Kyo / EX Iori). This isn't fair picking one. The returning VAs poured their souls into it. Mr. Karate's stoic power, EX Kyo's unleashed fury, EX Iori's primal scream.. Goosebumps. Every. Time. They went out on top. Respect.
Worst Voice: Billy Kane. ""HAI! HAI! HAI! HAI! HAI! HAI! HAI! HAI! HAI!"" Dude, I get it! You're hitting things! SHUT. UP. It's like a broken robot stuck on ""yes."" Aggressively annoying in a sea of perfection.",5,1751537082.0,kof,0,1.0,False

I'm now looking to upgrade, primarily with the goal of doubling the batch size to a full LB each time. Besides batch size, budget is a hard constraint and I'd like to stay under $800 or so range. I'd like artisan support or proprietary app support to rack and compare roast profiles. Any automation that the roaster provides is a plus but not needed as I'm perfectly happy to spend the 20 minutes every week needed to roast on my own.

Whereas my dad's side has more blood pressure issues (both sides), celiac (both sides), and general things like that not near as bad as moms. This is just background info that I can think of off the top of my head I can provide more if needed I'm not sure what would be relevant.

So I've been having weird issues like a lot of them. I'll stand up sometimes and my vision goes black for a few seconds sometimes longer (not sure exactly how long because I can't time it) never longer then a minute though then of course I get vision back. This has been happening for I can't even really recall how long maybe the past 3 years...? It's becoming more and more frequent in recent years sometimes occurring multiple times in one day. Another thing is I can't stand up still in one spot for too long before I get dizzy and have issues breathing again has been going on for years. Before anyone asks no I'm not morbidly obese I'm the correct weight for my height if not slightly overweight. I do workout at the gym 2-3× a week on top of the 4+ miles I usually walk on school days. I typically drink a good amount of water (sometimes I'm bad about it like when I'm at someone else's house I can get really bad about it). I am chronically tired and have been my entire life (I typically sleep 7-8 hours at night sometimes less on top of usually taking at least 1 nap a day that ranges from 1-2 hours) but that could just be normal. I know my family doesn't eat the healthiest but we do eat veggies and stuff I have had slight EDs in the past but currently I'm pretty good about it and at the very least eat 2 meals a day if not more. All this to say I don't think it's lifestyle. I do bruise really easy and these bruises can last a while some I'm convinced appear out of nowhere (I've been asked if I get abused because of how many bruises I typically have on my leg no I don't play any sports these are just things I get). I'm also get neasous pretty much every day and it typically gets to the point of I feel like I'm going to throw up but can't. I get dizzy really easy (It used to be really difficult to get me dizzy like I'd spin circles in the kitchen as a kid just to flex that I didn't ever get dizzy from it). One day I got so dizzy I had to go home because I was dizzy the entire day even after I took a nap (I had literally just eaten and drank water it was so bad my friends asked if I was drunk because my speech was slurred and I could hardly stand properly) I was on my period that day still dont know what that was about typically I dont get like that. Also I do not drink, smoke or do anything illicit like that. There are more things I just can't think of them off the top of my head sorry this is so long. Does anyone have any idea what could be happening? Should I go to the doctor? If anyone needs more info I can give it.

Edit 1: Forgot to add I have a really bad balance or maybe my ankles are just weak but I'm constantly tripping over myself. Also energy drinks/coffee have a weird effect on me like they don't quite work if I'm like slowly sipping them through the day then yeah kinda but like typically they just male me crash and fall asleep. Maybe it's because I'm not used to it tho I also do like get slurred speech hands becoming shaky things like that. Again that could be normal if it why tf do people drink caffine???",1,1751536404.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I had fought off rogues to save him from bites, endured wolfbane brewed by witches, and even during his in heat, I had even played the role of his mate. 

Even when his new lover was kidnapped by enemies, it was me he sent as the hostage for the exchange.

Everyone thought I was hopelessly in love with Erevan.

After all, our wolves had recognized each other the moment we met. But he loathed such primal instincts and refused to

acknowledge me as his mate. Still, I chose to stay by his side–without a name, without a title.

Even as one lover after another came and went, I remained. My daily job was to manage the chaos they left behind.

And the first time he truly looked at me was when that delicate Omega sobbed.

That was when he ordered me to go in her place for the exchange, tossing out a casual promise that he’ll mark me as

compensation.”

But after I returned, broken and bleeding from seven days and nights of torment, his first words weren’t about my injuries. 

He just ordered me to get back to work.

Erevan stood shirtless, each breath tightening his abs, like something savage and caged just beneath his skin, ready to break

free. 

He was pressing Virelle against the floor–to–ceiling window of his office, whispering the sweet nothings lovers share.

“Sweetheart, I bought you that pink diamond necklace you liked. Just a hundred million–no big deal.”

I stood at the door, face calm. Inside, I felt nothing.

For seven whole days, not even ten million could be scraped together for my ransom.

So it was Erevan deliberately had let the captors torture me longer on purpose.

My knee had only just been reattached by healing magic. The whip marks on my back, the knife scars on my hands–new skin had barely grown over them. They still stung.

But it was fine.

I was about to quietly retreat when I heard his voice, sharp and commanding.

“Stop.”

Erevan glanced at me. 

“There’s a new café downstairs. Virelle wants coffee. Now that you’re back, go get her some. You’ve got ten minutes.”

He gave the order with practiced ease. I nodded with the same mechanical grace.

9 minutes, 42 seconds.

I returned carrying ten different flavors of coffee, pale from the effort.

Virelle had dressed, though her blouse hung open to reveal a trail of hickeys she flaunted with pride.

Chapter 1

And my arm, lifting the coffee bags, showed scabbed–over wounds beneath the sleeve.

“It took you long enough. They’re cold now.”

Virelle pouted.

After I reheated them, she grabbed a cup, pretended to fumble, and spilled it on me–right on my open wounds.

She covered her mouth, gasping in feigned horror.

Erevan rushed over when he heard the commotion. His eyes skimmed over me, then softened with concern for Virelle.

“Did it burn you?”

She nodded pitifully.

And Erevan grabbed the rest of the coffee and poured it over my head.

My white shirt soaked instantly, clinging wetly to my skin.

“You can’t even handle this? Liora, this is your punishment.”

The liquid dripped down my bangs, stinging my eyes, blurring my vision.

That made me could barely make out his furious face.

Two seconds later, I bowed my head actively.

“I’m sorry.”

I’d apologized, but instead of softening, his expression turned colder.

That night, Erevan had a formal banquet.

In the past, I had always been the one to accompany him to these business functions. But this time, he brought Virelle too.

He must’ve really liked her.

When choosing my dress, I picked a long–sleeved gown that covered all my wounds.

Erevan frowned. “Why are you wrapped up like that?”

Before I could explain, he added, “Whatever. You’re just Virelle’s background tonight anyway. I don’t need you making an impression like you used to.”

The banquet hall buzzed with laughter and clinking glasses. Many guests came to toast Erevan.

Virelle shrank into his arms, shy and helpless.

“Erevan, I can’t drink…‘

He caressed her gently. “It’s okay, baby. Someone else can drink for you.”

I said nothing, silently accepting glass after glass of red wine and champagne from his business partners.

Once, I only drank for Erevan. Now, I drank for Virelle too.

My stomach burned, cramps twisting inside me.

I barely winced from the pain, but Erevan sharply noticed.

“What’s the matter? I thought you could handle your liquor. Only a few dozen glasses and you’re already tapping out?”

An older Alpha across the table laughed. “Come on, Liora’s known for her drinking. Don’t tell me you’re disrespecting me?”

Erevan’s gaze was icy.

“Liora, apologize to Mr. Gideon. If he’s not pleased tonight, don’t bother showing your face at the Rosenoir Pack tomorrow.”

Mr. Gideon’s greedy eyes dropped to my chest.

“Erevan, you’ve already got a beauty by your side. Why not lend Liora to me for one night?”",1,1751536313.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

So, picture this about a year ago, I’m standing there, just zoning out in front of the mirror, and I barely recognize the dude looking back at me. Man, it was rough every little flaw was like a neon sign flashing “not good enough.” My crooked smile that never quite lined up, the scars from some dumb moves I’d made, that heavy feeling like life was slipping through my fingers while I just watched it happen. I’d dodge that reflection like it was gonna bite me, turning away because, honestly, I didn’t think I deserved to like what I saw.

 My days were this blurry mess of second-guessing myself, and nights? Ugh, they were the worst lying awake, replaying every time I’d messed up like it was a highlight reel of failure. But then, one night, I’m sitting there, tears streaming down my face yeah, total snotty mess and something hit me. I looked at that tired, worn-out face in the mirror and thought, “Dude, you can’t keep doing this to yourself.” Right there, with tissues everywhere, I decided I was gonna try loving the guy I’d been avoiding, even if it took a lifetime to get there.  

So, I started this weird little morning thing facing that mirror head-on. At first, it felt so awkward, like I was talking to a stranger. I’d mumble stuff like, “Hey, you’re… alright, I guess?” because anything more sounded fake as heck. But I kept going, digging for one thing to appreciate maybe how I’d pushed through a tough day, or that quiet way I’d help a friend out. Over time, those little chats started to stick, turning into this warm little voice in my head that quieted down the mean stuff I used to tell myself. Then I got into this whole unloading thing.

 I grabbed a notebook and dumped all the junk I’d been carrying every regret, every time I’d beat myself up and you know what? I burned those pages one by one. Watching the smoke twist up into the air felt like letting go of a big ol’ chunk of that baggage. It wasn’t some instant magic trick; it was slow, like peeling off layers, and suddenly I had room to breathe again.  

Come nighttime, I started this chill ritual that kinda turned things around. I’d plop down under my lamp, thinking back on the day, hunting for one moment where I’d been brave maybe telling someone no when I usually just went along, or picking myself up after I’d tripped up. Some days, it was as basic as rolling out of bed, but I’d sit there and really let it sink in, like, “Hey, that’s something!” It wasn’t some quick fix more like stumbling through a messy rebuild of who I thought I was, with plenty of faceplants and a few good cries mixed in.

 But you know what? Pride started sneaking in there. I’m still figuring it out some mornings that mirror feels like a showdown but now, amid all the imperfections, I catch a glimpse of a guy I’m starting to cheer for, someone I can actually get behind.  

If you’re out there feeling like I did, stuck in that dark spot where you don’t even like your own shadow, trust me, you’ve got company in this. Take a minute, grab a coffee or whatever, and think what’s one thing about you, buried under all the noise, that you can hold onto today? 

Maybe it’s how you’ve kept going through the crap, the way you make people feel cared for, or just that quiet toughness that gets you up each day. Hang onto it, let it settle in, and drop it in the comments here. Let’s stumble through this together, lifting each other up till we’re all feeling a bit more like the rockstars we are!

For context We’re both single and above 18




So I’ve been going to this class to learn an instrument and I might be starting to like my instructor more than a friend.


To be honest we never had a student-teacher relationship. We always were friends and started the class off as friends. We send eachother memes and reels and it’s always been friendly banter between us. He is just an instructor, not the owner of the institution, so it’s easy for us to have an informal relationship. Anyways I’ve known him for almost three years now and we built great rapport right since the beginning which was like an instant connection.
One bright day I had a dream about how I went on a date with him and I woke up feeling a little ball of butterflies in my stomach for him. Almost a year and a half later here we are.
These are things which he has done which make me feel that there is something there:
	•	We had a thing where we were introducing ourselves and he had a little speech since he is one of the instructors. And during this entire speech he looked right into my eyes and looked away when I caught him looking at me. He also flirted with me when he was clearly tipsy.
	•	Same event a year later he did the same but only this time my friends noticed and ofc I did too but I didn’t look away, I looked at him fondly like a proud mama hen (lol) and he didn’t look away.
	•	At a show he also sort of made eye contact with me from stage (maybe I’m delusional maybe I’m not who knows).
	•	He offered me VIP tickets to this singer (v famous) since he knows the bassist.
	•	He offered me tix for the Backstreet Boys.
	•	He went to another country for a concert and brought back chocolates and gifts for me and told me he was looking for vinyls of my fav singer for me but couldn’t find them (he got chocolates for only his family, close friends and well, me).
	•	He got me this expensive-ish chocolate for my birthday (on the next day since I had class a day after) when he could have one forgotten and two gotten me a normal chocolate.
	•	We went to a big music festival where we went separately but were gonna meet inside. Unfortunately they had jammers inside so he couldn’t find me. Although he knew the stage I was gonna be at so he dragged his friends and came there and shouted out my name in front of 10,000 people idk why but hoping I’d find him. (That was so cute.)
	•	One time I couldn’t stop coughing so he offered to go get coffee for me.
	•	I was at his home studio where he made some coffee for me.
	•	We have gone to get coffee after class multiple times where he refuses to let me pay.
	•	My best friend passed away suddenly and he sort of knew her so the first class I went to he called me up beforehand and asked me if I wanted coffee and when I reached he was sitting in the dark and the lights were out and we ended up talking about everything and nothing for the next two hours amidst which we found out the lights were not gonna be on for another few hours but we still chose to stay and talk. During this he mentioned how he knew what bad happened but didn’t text me because he felt a text is going to do nothing except just remind me of it. And until that day I hadn’t even thought about this but that was exactly how I felt and I myself didn’t know about it but he did.
	•	He has ordered coffee for us multiple times and at this point he doesn’t even ask me since he knows my order.
	•	This one time at his house he was going to order coffee and insisted on paying and he threatened me saying ‘we’re literally ordering on my phone what makes you think you even have a chance to pay?’ He always acts so bewildered when I ask to pay like he gives me that ‘are you stupid?’ look.
	•	The next time he got me coffee I had decided to do something to make sure that it’s just me or that it isn’t in my head because this was making me lose my shit. Last week I asked him on text when he asked whether I wanted coffee that ‘how do you afford this’ and he didn’t reply to me right back on text but asked me what I meant by that once he came into the studio. I said ‘how do you afford getting coffee for all the students.’ Taking a deliberate pause I continued ‘or is it just me?’ I said smirking. To this day I can’t forget the look on his face. It was kind of a sheepish, coy smile/smirk which he was trying to hold back for sure. And then he says ‘actually….. it’s just you’ and I said ‘good. Keep it that way.’ Anyone would’ve known the way I said it was me flirting HARD.
	•	One time he called me to ask if I wanted ice cream and I said ‘aren’t you sick’ cause he was sick and he goes ‘yeah I am but this is for my family’ (parents and siblings) which made me spiral again. If it was for his family then why was he asking me?
	•	He also invited me to his band’s gig at a club which as far as I know he hasn’t invited anyone else to. He showed me the setlist and he’s playing one of my favourite songs. By a band he HATES. So I don’t know what to think.
	•	He also later invited me to pre-game booze with his band which just has me confused as fuck.
We’re both gonna drink and I don’t usually drink so let’s see what happens.



Just yesterday 

And then yesterday 
 I had a class after two weeks. Anyways I came to class and we talked and talked and talked and then he kept saying how he needed to ask me something. But he said that I should get this one specific part right and then he would tell me what it is. Around the end of the class I was like bro cut the suspense and ask me what you have to ask. And then he asked me if I had anything to do after class and then I said no even though I had to go get lunch w my friends. And then he said do you wanna get some coffee and I said yes duh. We walked to our bikes and he’s like do you wanna take two (yours and mine) bikes or we can go on mine and I can drop you back here? I said anything works and then he’s like let’s got tght then. AND I SAT BEHIND HIM AND WE WENT TOGETHER. I held his shoulder while i sat. We reached the coffee shop and he wouldn’t let me pay I tried to push him away but he was trying to block me from the cashiers place. 

We had coffee, talked sm and then left. And then he mentioned how he feels like eating chicken and then I said don’t you dare without me. And then he’s like what do you feel like eating today? and I’m like idk tbh nothing cause I wanna sleep. And he’s like agh same. (I think he wanted to ask me if we could get lunch) And then he’s like I’ll see you Friday for an extra class And I said yeah sure. And then he’s like oh do
You wanna eat pizza this Friday? And I’m like I mean if it’s my treat then yes. And he’s like well why? I’m anyways ordering it why would you pay? I was like cause you’ll be broke if you keep this up? And he dismissed me like ok bro say whatever you know and I know that I’m gonna pay anyways. 


The only problem here is our ages. He’s 7/8 years older than me. But I have never clicked like this with anyone. And romantic or not I for sure know that I’m definitely not making this connection up. I’m just confused on whether I’m delusional that it’s leaning towards romantic because the connection? It’s there and it’s not ignorable. It’s electric.

I hope everyone's doing great and serving up some fantastic brews! I recently stumbled upon something that I thought was really worth sharing with you all. It's a coffee company named **Cohoma Coffee** that I've recently tried out, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my home brewing experience. 

The thing I love is their **Original Custom Roast**. It's got a balanced cup, dark chocolatey, biscuity finish. The beans are 100% Grade A+ Arabica, hand-sourced directly from farmers, and roasted in-house. The aroma is intoxicating and the flavor hits all the right spots. It's a real treat for the senses. 

What's more, they also have a range of flavors like **Cinnamon Hazelnut, Organic Peppermint, and French Vanilla**. The French Vanilla Cold Brew is also a delight to the senses and is ready-to-drink. If you're someone who enjoys branching out and trying new flavors, I highly recommend you give these a shot. 

All-in-all, Cohoma Coffee seems to have nailed the farm-to-cup principle with a focus on quality and flavor, while also making the brew process as convenient as instant with their custom-made filters. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is... I've found a new love in coffee, and I wanted to share it with my barista brothers and sisters here. Anyone else tried these guys? Would love to hear your thoughts.

So, I started this weird little morning thing facing that mirror head-on. At first, it felt so awkward, like I was talking to a stranger. I’d mumble stuff like, “Hey, you’re… alright, I guess?” because anything more sounded fake as heck. But I kept going, digging for one thing to appreciate maybe how I’d pushed through a tough day, or that quiet way I’d help a friend out. Over time, those little chats started to stick, turning into this warm little voice in my head that quieted down the mean stuff I used to tell myself. Then I got into this whole unloading thing.

 I grabbed a notebook and dumped all the junk I’d been carrying every regret, every time I’d beat myself up and you know what? I burned those pages one by one. Watching the smoke twist up into the air felt like letting go of a big ol’ chunk of that baggage. It wasn’t some instant magic trick; it was slow, like peeling off layers, and suddenly I had room to breathe again.  

Come nighttime, I started this chill ritual that kinda turned things around. I’d plop down under my lamp, thinking back on the day, hunting for one moment where I’d been brave maybe telling someone no when I usually just went along, or picking myself up after I’d tripped up. Some days, it was as basic as rolling out of bed, but I’d sit there and really let it sink in, like, “Hey, that’s something!” It wasn’t some quick fix more like stumbling through a messy rebuild of who I thought I was, with plenty of faceplants and a few good cries mixed in.

 But you know what? Pride started sneaking in there. I’m still figuring it out some mornings that mirror feels like a showdown but now, amid all the imperfections, I catch a glimpse of a guy I’m starting to cheer for, someone I can actually get behind.  

If you’re out there feeling like I did, stuck in that dark spot where you don’t even like your own shadow, trust me, you’ve got company in this. Take a minute, grab a coffee or whatever, and think what’s one thing about you, buried under all the noise, that you can hold onto today? 

Maybe it’s how you’ve kept going through the crap, the way you make people feel cared for, or just that quiet toughness that gets you up each day. Hang onto it, let it settle in, and drop it in the comments here. Let’s stumble through this together, lifting each other up till we’re all feeling a bit more like the rockstars we are!

The beans don't necessarily have to be from German roasters, although I've always wanted to try LF. But if the café sells great overseas beans, for example from the US, UK or Scandinavia, that's totally fine too.

1lqlbub,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1lqlbub/parking_and_eloquence/,Parking and eloquence,"I just had an interesting morning. 

To keep it brief, I normally work from one of several small offices in my area. Shortish commutes all within 20 miles. I occasionally - very occasionally - get a day to work from home.

Today was one of those days. Great! Drop the kids to their nursery and back in time to get a coffee and sit at my desk to get on with boring paperworky things (and, ngl, sneak some Civ 6 in while working).

There are two things to know about my house - its mostly suburban, but there are a number of small offices and business nearby, and I opened up the front garden (took the wall half down, paved it a little more) a few years back for easier off street parking, because it was getting difficult due to the businesses on the street outside. Hairdressers, a dentist, corner shops, a few small offices.

I'm turning into my garden and suddenly I'm bumper to bumper with another car. Minor crash missed by inches. The other driver rolls down her window and shouts something. So I get out of my car. Bear in mind we're both basically in my garden, here. 

""This isn't customer parking, you need to move."" She says as I go to her window.

Now, I know we see all these interactions here where people have witty comebacks and snappy rejoinders. Mine was ""Huh?""

""This is parking for my business, you need to move or I'll phone 101."" (101 is police non emergency here).

Again, I'm the height of wit so I say ""What are you on about?"" (Translation: what kind of rubbish are you taking?)

""Move your car! This is my parking space!"" 

This is where I finally realised she thought she was entitled to park in my front garden. I finally had a witty comeback chance!

Me shouting ""what the fuck are you on about, this is my garden, get the fuck out!"" Didn't even phase her.

Witty comeback wasted. Felt good though.

""I've been parking here for 3 months, I got her first, it's mine! I'm calling the police!""

I just ignored her, left my car  and walked inside to put the kettle on. There were a few shouted words I couldn't make out. About 30 minutes later (only an hour ago, now) there are 2 policemen at my door. I invite them in for a cup of tea, and they actually accept. She actually called the police over me parking in my garden.

Then they tell me that they had a call about illegal parking blocking access to a car park, and it took them all of 10 seconds to figure out what had happened and they sent her on her merry way.

The best bit is her business is about 50m away. Why she would think my garden - 50m down the road on the other side of 2 lanes of traffic in front of a private house - is her workplace car park is beyond me.

As an aside, 3 months!? I didn't think it had been that long since I was last working from home but because me and the Mrs are usually gone from 8-6 we obviously completely missed it.

Now I'm wondering if she spent Easter - when I was off - fuming about the fat man with the bushy ginger beard who kept stealing her parking spot.",4,1751535345.0,EntitledPeople,3,1.0,False

I sell a lot of tea brewing glass bottles online, and most of my customers have no issues with it. Except I get a lot of negative feedback from old folks who rather not listen to instructions, pour BOILING WATER instead of hot water around 85c, SEAL the bottle tight, creating immense pressure and stress to the bottle. Then once in a while the cover pops from the internal pressure and boiling water began leaking from the top, sometimes accidentally burning those who are still holding it.

I understand that my products are made of glass and might not have the best resistance against such brewing method, but personally I don't get why would anyone wanted to use boiling water to brew their tea/coffee in a glass bottle that is not thicker than kettle or pot? Those bottles are meant for carrying around, hence they are lighter than typical pots. It's physics yo, if you want to brew teas or coffee with boiling water you need the right gear/setup for it? Maybe boiling water brews faster for some but you are carrying it around anyway, it's meant to be a flexible way to have simple tea/coffee, not a replacement for the entire setup?

Btw I don't really get drinking boiling water, it's a drag to wait for it to cool down slightly to reach the perfect warm taste, and it burns your tongue and mouth pretty bad, plus I heard if you do this in the long run there's a risk to mouth and stomach cancers. Most of my customers who use boiling water to brew tea/coffee expects it to be the faster procedure to get their drink ready to be consumed as early as within 1 minutes.",3,1751535044.0,barista,16,0.8,False

## FAQs Section

Considering chalkboard art for your home, business, or event? Here are some frequently asked questions.

**What type of chalk is best for chalkboard drawings?**
Soft chalk, also known as artist's chalk or pastel chalk, is generally best for chalkboard drawings. It glides smoothly on the chalkboard surface and provides rich, vibrant colors. Avoid using hard chalk,as it can scratch the surface and leave residue.

**How do I prevent chalk from smudging on my chalkboard drawing?**
To minimize smudging, apply a light coat of hairspray or chalkboard sealant to the finished drawing. This will help set the chalk and prevent it from rubbing off easily. Be sure to test the sealant in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage the chalkboard surface.

**How do I clean a chalkboard without leaving streaks?**
Use a damp microfiber cloth to wipe the chalkboard surface. Avoid using excessive water, as it can cause streaks. Wipe in a circular motion, and then use a dry microfiber cloth to buff the surface until it is clean and streak-free.

**Can I use colored chalk on a chalkboard?**
Yes, you can use colored chalk on a chalkboard to create vibrant and eye-catching drawings.Experiment with different colors and blending techniques to achieve the desired effect. Just make sure to test the chalk in a small area first to ensure it doesn't stain the chalkboard surface.

Welcome back to another development update! Today I want to share the story behind Realm of Dungeons and how this project came to life. It's been quite a journey, and I think you'll find it interesting to see how everything started.

# The Spark That Started It All

Like many of you, I spent countless hours playing classic browser RPGs. Games like Shakes & Fidget, Gladiatus, and similar titles completely captured my imagination. There was something magical about these games - the simple yet addictive progression, the community feeling, and that satisfying ""just one more quest"" gameplay loop.

When I started my developer journey, I knew I wanted to create something like this. Those games shaped my understanding of what makes RPGs fun, and I always dreamed of building my own version that could bring that same joy to players.

# First Attempt - The 2023 Prototype

In 2023, I finally decided to turn this dream into reality. I started working on a web browser version of what I called ""Realm of Dungeons."" Looking back, I was excited but also quite inexperienced compared to where I am now.

The original browser version had the basic ideas in place, but it was rough around the edges. You can see in the images below how it looked back then - definitely not as polished as what we have today! Despite its simple appearance, it managed to attract around 140 registered users who believed in the concept.

Here are some screens from that prototype (fun fact it was all made in Canvas with Pixi.js)

[old RoD web version - Character screen](https://preview.redd.it/dk8uj3eilmaf1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=42fbe0d808be8e0588656241c38aeaa6c5c67833)

# The Difficult Decision

After months of development, I made one of the hardest decisions of my developer journey - I abandoned the project. It wasn't an easy choice, but I felt overwhelmed and wasn't sure if I had the skills to make it truly special. Those 140 users trusted me with their time, and I felt like I was letting them down.

For about a year, Realm of Dungeons sat quietly in my project folder. But the idea never really left my mind. I kept thinking about those classic games that inspired me and how there was still room for something new in that space.

# The Second Chance

A year later, I realized I couldn't give up on this dream. I had gained more experience, learned new skills, and most importantly, I had found the motivation and dedication needed to see this through. I decided to give Realm of Dungeons one more chance - but this time, I was going to take it seriously.

This wasn't just about remaking the old browser version. This was about creating something better, something that could really compete with the games that inspired me, but with modern touches and genuine care for the community.

What followed was 10 months of daily development work alongside my full-time job. Every evening after work, and every weekend - I was working on Realm of Dungeons.

This meant:

* Creating hundreds of pixel art items and characters
* Balancing game mechanics over and over again
* Fixing countless bugs (some that kept me up at night!)
* Writing item descriptions and game text
* Trying hundreds of different approaches to make things work just right
* Learning mobile development from scratch

Some days were harder than others. There were moments when I questioned if I was crazy for spending so much time on this project. But every time I saw the game getting better, every time a feature finally worked the way I imagined, I knew it was worth it.

# The Vision Behind It All

What drives me isn't just making another mobile game. I want to create something that brings back that nostalgic feeling we had playing those classic browser RPGs. I want Realm of Dungeons to have that same charm and magic, but with the convenience of modern mobile gaming.

More importantly, I want to build a game where the community actually matters. We've all seen what happens with games from big companies - look at Gladiatus, which hasn't had a real update in years despite having a loyal player base. Players share their ideas and feedback, but nothing changes.

That's not what I want for Realm of Dungeons. I want this to be a game that grows with its community, where player feedback shapes the future, and where everyone feels heard.

# Official Launch

After those 10 months of intense development, the Closed Beta finally launched officially. It's not perfect - no game ever is - but it's something I'm truly proud of. The core systems work, the art has personality, and most importantly, it's fun to play.

The response from our early testers has been incredible. Seeing people enjoy something I've poured my heart into for almost a year is an amazing feeling.

# What Makes This Different

Realm of Dungeons isn't trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead, it's taking the best parts of those classic games we love and making them work perfectly on mobile devices. It's about respecting both your time and your intelligence as a player.

We're not trying to trick you into spending money or keep you glued to your phone for hours. We want you to have fun, make progress, and feel good about the time you spend in our world.

# Looking Forward

This is just the beginning. Every feature we add, every balance change we make, and every new piece of content we create will be shaped by our community's input. We're not just making a game - we're building a world together.

The browser version from 2023 taught me that having a good idea isn't enough. You need dedication, skill, and the willingness to keep improving. Most importantly, you need to listen to your players and never stop caring about their experience.

# A Personal Thank You

To the 140 people who tried that first rough version back in 2023 - thank you for believing in the idea even when it wasn't ready. To everyone who's joined our Closed Beta now - thank you for being part of this journey.

And to anyone reading this who's thinking about joining us - welcome! Whether you're a veteran of classic browser RPGs or someone discovering this style of game for the first time, there's a place for you in Realm of Dungeons.

Until then, keep adventuring!

Curious to know what people think! They're certainly a bit complex, but I figured if we were going to be spending this much time on them, it'd be fun to do it properly, rather than a binary ""drunk/not drunk"" switch being flipped. I must say, having all the characters at different levels of intoxication, only to get jumped by goons on the way back to the hideout led to a very funny combat encounter.

**DRINKING RULES**

Every drink that a character consumes requires them to roll a constitution saving throw with a **DC of 10, +2 for every other drink had in the last 12 hours (with advantage if the player has resistance to poison).** Every time they fail the check, it grants the character **one level of drunkenness.** If they go two hours without drinking any more alcohol, they automatically go down a level. At the DM's discretion, application of coffee, cold showers and healing magic may speed up this process.

1. **Merry**. Advantage on persuasion checks, but disadvantage on insight checks.
2. **Tipsy.** Disadvantage on sleight of hand and insight checks, but advantage on checks made to resist being frightened.
3. **Drunk.** The character has the Poisoned Condition, and their own feet are considered difficult terrain, halving all movement speed. They are immune to the Frightened condition, and even successful attempts to magically read their thoughts have a 50% chance to reveal only incomprehensible rambling, possibly about kebabs or old movie trivia.
4. **Soused.** The character has all the above penalties and bonuses associated with level 3 drunkenness, but in addition, any time they attempt to move more than ten feet in one round, they have a 25% chance to immediately fall prone and lose all remaining movement.
5. **Blackout.** The player falls unconscious for 1d4+1 hours.

**Hangovers:** Once the effects of alcohol wear off completely (i.e., level 0), the player must roll a constitution saving throw with a DC of (5x highest inebriation level reached). If they fail, they are considered Poisoned for 2d4 hours. During that time, they are also Vulnerable to Radiant and Thunder damage.",8,1751533837.0,dndnext,7,1.0,False

1lqkwzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1lqkwzo/looking_for_some_advice_on_my_work_ethic_and/,Looking for some advice on my work ethic and possibly how to get more done.,"I'm working on my own PC game. I'm doing this full time, working from home.

My schedule is a bit complex, because my girlfriend works in shifts and I drive her from/to work. When she has an early shift, she wakes me up at 6am to drive her to work. When she has a late shift, I pick her up from work at 11pm. So when she has an early shift, I'll be back home around 7am, when she has a late shift we sleep until 8-9am. When I get back home or when we wake up, I drink a coffee and immediately start working.

I do a lot of programming, heavy thinking, highly focused. Usually after about 3 hours, when I complete the thing I've been working on, I stop the high focus work.

Currently there's not much else for me to do for my game, since it's in a very early development stage, nearly all the work requires high focus.

Should I try to get in some more work after a break or something? Or is 3-4 hours of high focus work enough for one day?

I sometimes do some more low effort work, like advertise a bit on reddit, make some promo video for the game, talk to some people about my game, help some other developers, ...

Once the game is in a more finished state I'll have plenty more low effort tasks to do, but for now not much.

I feel kinda bad only working 3-4 hours per day, but I'm also completely drained after those few hours. Especially when I didn't get enough sleep.

I've seen a lot of YT videos that say you can slowly build up the time you can stay highly focused, but I'm not sure how healthy that would be for me.

I've struggled really hard in the past with tons of things, to get to this workflow, which I've been consistently doing for about 2 months now. My idea is that consistently working on my game for 3 hours per day, 5-6 days per week, will yield much better results than trying to work more, burning out and then not doing anything for several weeks/months. (Which has happend plenty of times in the past.)

How do I know if I'm lazy or if I'm trying to push myself too hard?

Tips and thoughts are welcome :)

TL/DR:

I currently work highly focused for 3-4 hours per day, and I'm drained after that. Is that enough? Should I try to work more? Why? Why not? How?",1,1751533668.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

The battle lines were drawn.

Erin stared up at her enemy with unwavering brown eyes. Sure, her lip trembled a little, but she hid it well. She wouldn’t cry. Even if he did it, she wouldn’t cry.

But would he? Would he really do it?

Her heart arrested with fear in her chest, Erin watched the boy smirk as his hand wrapped firmly around the head of her treasured woollen doll.

He wouldn’t dare.

That evil glint flickered in his eyes and before Erin could say a thing, he jerked his arm back, ripping off the head of her doll and with no remorse, tossing it across the vast backyard.

Erin was frozen in place, her eyes wide in disbelief.

“Told you I’d do it,” he told her, his mouth curved in that smirk that she despised so much. He scoffed. “What? You gonna cry?”

Erin looked at him, her lip openly trembling now.

“That…” she started. “…was a Christmas present from my mom!” With tearing eyes and an angry scream, she threw herself at him, beating him with all the strength her nine year old fists could muster.

They fell to the ground, tussling upon the green grass of the luxurious estate.

“Get away from me!” the boy snapped, disgusted to have the bratty little girl touch his expensive clothes.

Erin dug her fingers into his thick blonde hair, gripping and tugging as hard as she could until he screamed at the top of his lungs.

“Help!” screamed the boy, but very soon he could no longer form words because Erin’s sharp little teeth had sunk into his cheek and he could do nothing but scream.

“Erin! Braden! What in the world?!”

Strong hands tugged them away from each other and the two children stood, glaring at one another and breathless from their fight.

“He started it!!” screamed Erin, unable to stop the tears from flowing now.

Her mother released their arms and crossed her own as she looked down at her daughter.

“Erin! What did I say—”

“He really started it, mommy!” she cried, embarrassed of her tears but unable to stop crying. Braden really was such a horrible boy. If she’d known that she had to live with him, Erin would have run away to the ocean to live on the beach. “He b-broke my dolly! And it was my Christmas present!”

“You bit me!” Braden retorted, glaring at Erin.

“Both of you stop it,” said Erin’s mother. “Braden, I’ll keep Erin out of your way, so please, you may return to your lessons.”

Erin looked up at her mother in disbelief. “Mom! I told you he started it!”

“Just shut up!” Braden told her, holding his throbbing cheek.

“What’s going on here?”

Erin watched her mom turn around, startled by the voice of her boss.

Walking towards them was Julius Stone, Chairman of Stone Inc. and the owner of the grand estate upon which they stood. A man with millions in his pocket and even more in his bank. His white hair looked bright in the sunlight, the suit he wore from one of the most elite clothing brands. To Erin, he seemed to own the whole world.

And he just happened to be Braden’s grandfather.

“Oh! Good day, Sir!” said Erin’s mother hurriedly. “I wasn’t aware that you’d be home so early.”

“Grandpa!” Braden screamed, his voice pitiful as he ran to his grandfather’s side. He immediately pointed an accusing finger at Erin. “The maid’s daughter bit me! Look!”

Erin’s mother gasped, clutching the front of her uniform. Shaking her head, she raised her hands in a plea. “It was only a mistake, Sir! I promise it will not happen again! Erin…” Reaching back, she tugged Erin forward. “Say sorry to Braden. Go on!”

As silent as a stone, Erin bit her lip as more tears flowed. She would not apologize to Braden Stone even if they promised her a pony!

Silently, Julius tilted his grandson’s face, studying the clear bite marks on his reddened cheek. She’d bitten him alright.

He looked at Erin. “Little girl?”

Slowly raising her eyes to the tall man before her, Erin sniffled and tried to stop crying. “Y-yes, Sir.”

“What happened?”

Swallowing hard and wiping a hand across her cheek, Erin looked up at Braden’s grandpa. “B-braden broke my dolly,” she explained tearfully.

“Did not!” he snapped.

“Did too! You broke off her head and threw it over there!” Erin cried. She looked up at his grandpa with a nod. “He really did! He told me it was s-smelly and old and that my mom was too poor to get me toys like his!”

“Cause it’s true!” snapped Braden.

“Stop it!” Erin flew at him with her fists, caught halfway by her mother’s arms.

“Erin!” chided her mother. “Stop this immediately.” She looked at her boss who remained silent, watching Erin and all her antics. “I’m really sorry, Sir!”

Julius raised a hand, waving away his house help’s apologies.

“Little girl.”

At his addressing her, Erin stopped and stilled, raising her gaze to meet his. “Yes, sir.”

“Do you think it is okay to hit or hurt others?”

The slight rebuke made Erin lower her gaze. “It… it was my Christmas present… my mom made it.”

At the fat tears that rolled down the little girl’s face, Julius sighed.

“It was stinky and ugly anyway,” Braden told her.

“That’s enough!” barked Julius. Startled by his grandfather’s sudden shout, Braden shrunk back. “Not another word out of you, Braden.” Turning back to the little girl, Julius took a gentler tone. “I asked a question, little girl.”

Erin’s shoulders slumped.

Of course. Braden’s grandpa would defend him. And he would probably send her and her mother away because she bit Braden. The thought made Erin’s heart quiver with fear. They’d lived here since Erin was five and her mom would be so sad if they sent them away. They had nowhere else to go.

Erin clenched her fists. “No,” she said quietly. “… it is not okay to hurt others.” Slowly, she raised her gaze to Julius Stone’s. “But it’s also bad to break someone’s dolly.”

“Erin!” scolded her mother.

“I know I bit him, but it was because he made me mad when he broke my dolly! I told him not to! My mom didn’t do anything wrong so you can’t send her away, Sir! Fine!” She looked at Braden angrily. “Sorry I bit you, Braden!” Her teary gaze went back to his grandfather’s. “I said sorry, you can’t send us away! He was wrong to break my dolly!”

Julius raised a hand, silencing her while he looked at Erin with eyes of slight intrigue. The little girl had more spirit than all of his male descendants combined. “That’s true,” Julius calmly agreed, turning to his grandson. “He was wrong. That is why Braden will also apologize.”

Braden’s head snapped up to look at his grandfather. “Grandpa!”

“Immediately, Braden. Or else.”

With his grandfather’s last two words striking fear into him, Braden was left with no choice but to look at Erin. She looked back at him with bold eyes. He clenched his jaw, glaring at her. How dare she? Who was she to get an apology from him?! She was just the maid’s child while he… he was the heir of a billion dollar fortune.

Braden’s teeth clenched tighter. He would make her pay for this. “I’m… sorry.”

Julius set a hand on his grandson’s shoulder. “Good.” He looked at Erin. “He’s apologized and I promise to ensure that your doll is replaced by one identical to it. Is that alright?”

Erin was struck silent by shock. Braden had apologized to her. For the first time ever. She blinked up at his grandfather. He’d get her a new dolly? Slowly, she nodded. “Y-yes. Yes, sir.”

Behind her, her mother released a breath of relief. “I’ll prepare lunch, Sir.”

Julius nodded and turned to lead his grandson away.

“Come in to eat, sweetheart,” said her mother to her, wiping away Erin’s tears and kissing her forehead before she hurried off towards the house.

Erin watched Julius Stone walk away with his grandson and scratched her head in puzzlement.

He’d made Braden say sorry and he was going to get her a new dolly? Erin couldn’t believe it. Braden’s grandpa wasn’t as scary as she’d always believed. The Chairman was someone who owned everything and yet he was… nice.

Halfway to the house, Braden turned back and his sharp, blue-eyed gaze met Erin’s. She felt a chill race over her arms at his cold stare and hugged herself.

That glint flickered in his eyes. He was going to get his revenge.
﻿
Chapter 2
*2 days later*

Erin happily rocked back and forth at the kitchen table where she sat, watching her mother finish up the last of her chores.

“A minute, okay sweetie?” said her mom.

“Okay,” Erin told her, sounding patient, but actually being really anxious to go on to their quarters for the night. Because it wasn’t yet bedtime, her mom had promised to help her assemble the new doll house and have a tea party.

Erin was ecstatic, even if she didn’t show it. She had been shocked to the bone when, besides a woollen doll very much like the one her mom had made her, the Chairman had sent her a whole range of new dollies! They came with clothes, a doll house and pretty brushes for their hair.

Erin couldn’t believe her luck! And it was all thanks to the Chairman. She smiled at the thought of him. He was like Santa.

“Okay, honey, I’m done!”

Grinning, Erin hopped off the chair but quickly came to a halt when, suddenly, Braden appeared in the large kitchen. At the mere sight of him, Erin’s heart deflated like a popped balloon. What did he want?

“Braden,” said her mother with a soft smile. “What’s wrong? You want some water?”

Looking at Erin with his mouth curved in a sardonic smirk, the boy dug his hands into the pockets of his thick bathrobe. He’d been listening at the door. He knew the plans Erin had with her mother and there was no way he’d let such a perfect chance for revenge slip through his fingers.

Clearing his throat, he pulled out a hand and examined his fingernails. “No, I don’t want water, Alicia. I’m hungry.”

Erin frowned, but her mother wasn’t yet bothered.

“Oh?"" Said her mother to Braden. “What would you like? Should I quickly put together a beef sandwich for you?”

Crossing his arms, Braden sighed. “Nope. I don’t think I want a sandwich. I think…” He looked at Erin, smiled. “I want a cheesy macaroni and beef casserole. I also feel like having some chocolate cake… yes.”

Erin’s mouth fell open.

Her mother raised her brows. “A… a casserole? Cake…? At this time of the night, Braden?”

Turning his fierce little blue eyes on her, Braden raised a brow. “Are you refusing? Should I tell my father that the maid refused to make me food?”

Alicia released a breath and quickly shook her head. “No, no… I… I didn’t say no, Braden.”

Erin turned to her mother in surprise. “Mom!”

Alicia immediately raised a hand to silence her daughter. If Erin got herself worked up about this it would end with her fighting Braden and, this time, they might really get kicked out. Alicia had to just do what the boy wanted. After all… he was heir to all of it.

“I’m sorry, honey, mommy’s got to work a little while longer,” she told Erin, putting her apron back on. “You can keep me company or go on to bed if you’re tired, love.”

Speechless, Erin watched her mother turn back to the stoves that she’d just cleaned spotless and begin pulling out clean pots and pans to get cooking.

She couldn’t believe it! Furious, Erin turned to face Braden only to find that he was grinning at her.

“And that,” he said quietly for only her to hear. “…is what you get when you challenge me.”

“What’s your problem, Braden?” Erin asked him, her eyes already pricking with tears again. She hated how she was such a cry baby whenever he was around!

“You made me say sorry!” he muttered darkly. “My dad says all this is going to be mine, so I don’t have to listen to anyone. I can do what I like! But you, the maid’s child, made me apologize!”

Erin’s fists clenched, her heart full of anger at how unfair it all was! “You’re only ten!” she told him angrily. “You don’t have anything! This whole giant house belongs to your grandpa, not you!”

“Erin,” called her mother from the other end of the vast kitchen. “What’s going on?”

Erin glanced at her mom and, pouting, shook her head. “Nothing, mommy. I... I’m just talking to… Braden.”

Alicia looked at them worriedly and nodded. “Okay. Don’t fight, you two. Braden, your aunt’s sleeping and you know she hates noise.”

Braden rolled his eyes. “Whatever, Alicia. She can’t hear us from her room anyway.”

Erin glared at him as her mother went back to her work. “Don’t talk to my mom like that,” she warned. “It’s not nice.”

“I’ll talk how I like. That’s what you get for biting me!” he told her, before smirking and turning on his heel to leave the kitchen. At the exit, he glanced back at her. “You better not have given me rabies or whatever poor people have, or else!”

Ignoring the look of injury in her eyes, he walked off with a triumphant smile. Erin stood staring at the empty exit for a little while, his mean words replaying in her head.

She knew two things now. One: she would not be playing dollies with her mom tonight. Two: she hated Braden Stone.

*******************

It was late into the night and Erin was nodding off on the chair where she’d sat to keep her mom company. A gentle hand touched her shoulder.

“Erin, honey, I’m done. Wake up,” said her mom gently.

Erin blinked her eyes open, her nose twitching at the delicious aromas that filled the kitchen.

“Come on,” said her mom, holding her hand and guiding her off the high chair. “Let’s go to bed.”

Rubbing her eye, Erin let herself be led. Suddenly, her mom came to a stop.

“Oh, Braden, there you are,” she said.

Erin’s eyes flew open. What did he want now?

“Did you make the food?” he asked haughtily.

Alicia pursed her lips and nodded tiredly. “Yes. I’ve set it out on the dining table for you, so you may go ahead and eat.”

Erin glared sleepily at him. The boy truly was evil itself.

Braden sighed and put his hands in his pockets. “Well… now that I think about it… I’m not really hungry anymore.”

Erin’s mouth parted. What? He was no longer hungry? What?!

Alicia only stared at the boy. “But you asked me to—”

“Yes, but now I’m not hungry anymore.” He smiled at them, his handsome face and smile so much like his father’s, and sadly, his evil little heart too. “You may throw it all out.”

“But you wanted to eat!” said Erin furiously. “We couldn’t play dollies because you wanted to eat!!”

Her mother wrapped an arm around her shoulders. “Shh, shh! It’s okay, honey. It’s alright. Calm down.”

Braden looked at her and crossed his arms. “I say if I’m hungry or not. You just do what I say.”

Erin had never been more furious in her life! Even when her best friend, Jackson, ruined her pretty drawings at school she hadn’t been this angry.

“It’s alright,” said her mother, moving to pack everything away.

Erin shook her head, eyes filling with angry tears. It wasn’t alright. It wasn’t alright at all.

When Braden’s mouth curved in that horrid smirk of his, Erin lost it. This time, whether they got kicked out or not, she did not care. She’d rip off this boy’s ears if it was the last thing she did.
 
Chapter 3
Erin leaped for Braden’s throat, furious at how he’d treated her mother, but before she could even reach him, a loud crash echoed through the mansion, making her jump back in alarm.

“What in the world?!” said her mother, startled.

Erin tucked her hands against her chest, staring wide-eyed at her mom. “Mommy, what was that?”

Alicia shook her head at the children’s bewildered expressions. “I have no clue, love.” Slowly, she made her way out of the kitchen, through the dining hall and towards the entrance hall.

“You fool!” the Chairman’s roar suddenly shook the walls. “What have I not done for you, Michael?! What have I not done?!”

Frightened by the angry shouting, Erin hid behind her mother, peeking out as they silently approached the entrance of the home.

The sight was one that made Erin blink in surprise. Sitting against the front door with blood trickling from his nose was Michael Stone, Braden’s father. Around him were the scattered pieces of the antique vase that the Chairman, in his anger, had flung to the floor.

Braden stood, watching them with wide eyes, confused as to what was going on.

The Chairman stood over his son, his grey eyes dark with fury. “When will you grow up, Michael? When?! Do you think I’ll be alive forever?! When will you become responsible?! Partying, drinking, drugs! Is that all you know?!”

The shouting got louder and louder, frightening Erin even more. Her mom laid a hand on her shoulder. “Come on, Erin honey,” she whispered. “We need to go. The Chairman and Mr. Stone are discussing grown up stuff.”

“Ms. Moore?”

Erin’s mom turned around to face the person who’d called her. At the foot of the stairs stood a very sleepy, grumpy looking blonde.

“What’s going on?”

“Oh, Stephanie!” said Erin’s mom. “Woke you up, didn’t they?”

Stephanie Stone tightened the belt of her robe as she approached to peak into the entrance hall and analyse the situation. “Dad and Michael at it again?”

Alicia cringed. “The Chairman’s furious. Michael came home late again. And I think he’s drunk.”

Stephanie rolled her green eyes to the ceiling. “That irresponsible cow.” She sighed heavily. “Let’s talk in the kitchen, Ms. Moore. I’ll make us tea since, clearly, nobody’s going to bed any time soon.”

Alicia nodded. “Come, Erin.”

Erin stood, captivated by the spectacle in the entrance hall, unaware that her mom had left for the kitchen.

“Get off my case, dad,” grumbled Michael Stone in a deep, gruff voice as he wiped at his nose.

“I will when you grow up! You’re thirty-five-years-old, for goodness sake!” barked the Chairman. He looked down at his son with mixed feelings of pity, anger, regret and sorrow. “Single-handedly,” said the Chairman. “Single-handedly, I built my empire up to what it is today and yet, with a fool like you as a son I have no one to leave my fortune to! No one I can trust to be wise enough, smart enough and responsible enough to take the Stone Empire to even greater heights!”

Michael leaned his head back against the front doors, his head spinning from all the Cognac in his veins. “Stephanie—”

“Your sister has no interest in the family business, you know that!” yelled the Chairman. Stepping back, he laid a hand against his chest as a coughing fit suddenly rocked through his chest.

“Grandpa!” exclaimed Braden, rushing forward to grip his grandfather’s elbow, afraid he'd collapse.

“Hey, son!” greeted Michael cheerfully, raising a hand to wave at Braden. Gasping loudly and dramatically, he slapped both hands against his cheeks and looked at his father who was finally breathing well again. “Oh, my God, daddy! I just remembered something!” Raising a hand, Michael pointed at his son. “You’ve got an heir! Right there! Braden! Ha-ha! Okay? So, please…” Pushing against the door, he pulled himself to his feet and stood, swaying, before his father. “Please… take all your damn expectations and all your shitty responsibilities and give them to him! Okay?”

Staring at his son with a tightly clenched jaw, Julius Stone found himself cursing the day he’d had this boy. He’d been nothing… nothing at all but trouble since he was born.

He turned his gaze to Braden’s and the boy looked up at him, eyes full of confidence. He knew it. He knew he was heir and took far too much pride in it.

Julius scoffed. “The son… is just like the father.”

Michael narrowed his eyes at his father. “I’m nothing like you.”

Julius sneered at him. “Damn right, you’re not! You’re the replica of your mother’s father. I meant that this boy…” He looked sadly at Braden. His last hope for an heir. “…is just like you!”

Michael snorted. “Well… tough. Take him or leave him, dad. You’ve got no choice anyway.”

The Chairman felt rage course through him at his son’s careless words. True, Braden was his only choice for an heir, but Julius would be damned if he left his empire in the hands of someone so much like Michael just because he had no choice!

“No choice?” he asked, his voice trembling with fury. “No choice?! I am Julius Stone! I will create a damn choice!”

Looking around him in a frenzy, the Chairman grew more and more frantic until his gaze landed on her.

Erin. The maid’s daughter.

Shrugging his grandson’s hand off his elbow, Julius took a step toward Erin whose eyes grew large.

“You,” said Julius pointing at her.

Erin blinked. “M-me?”

“Yes, you, little girl. Come here.”

So frightened, she looked tiny and mouse-like, Erin looked at Braden who frowned at her, wondering why his grandpa suddenly called her into their private family affairs.

“Come over here, Erin Moore!” commanded the Chairman. “Do not be afraid.”

Swallowing, Erin cautiously walked over to the Chairman and looked up at him.

Nodding in satisfaction with his own idea, Julius Stone looked at his son. Michael looked back at him in puzzlement.

“Okay?” said Michael. “The maid’s kid. And?”

Julius let a smile curve his mouth. This was genius. He should have thought of this before. His son was a fool, but he was a fool who loved the luxury of wealth.

“You, Michael,” began the Chairman, his tone heavy and serious. “Are to, from this day onward, do your utmost… to train your son well so that when he becomes a man… he will be nothing like you.”

Michael Stone narrowed his eyes. “Or what?”

Julius scoffed. “Oh, Michael, boy. You will do as I say.” He looked at Braden, whose face was full of confusion. “Both you and Braden will do exactly as I say, or else… my everything… my all… my empire, every goddamn *penny*… goes to Erin Moore. The maid’s daughter.”
 
Chapter 4
The Stone mansion was in an uproar and with all the eyes on her, Erin could tell she was the cause of it.

She sat on a chair, her mother’s arms wrapped tightly around her as the Stones argued before them.

Stephanie put her hands on her hips as she stepped in between Michael and her father, certain it wouldn’t be long before Michael was punched and sent flying through a window by their father.

When his daughter’s calm face appeared in his vision, Julius Stone huffed and looked down at her.

Stephanie raised a brow. “Dad—”

“No, Stephanie!” the Chairman cut her off, raising a hand. “I’ve made up my mind and none of you can convince me otherwise!”

Michael bared his teeth. “You’ve gone fucking senile!”

Stephanie turned on him. “Shut up, Michael! Don’t you dare talk to dad like that!”

Michael clenched his fists tightly, pressing them against his bloodshot eyes as he growled out in frustration. “Are you kidding me? You fucking kidding me, Steph?! He’s giving away all our money to a goddamn beggar kid!”

“Yes!” said the Chairman. He pointed at Erin. “In the last three years that this child has lived here, she’s always shown far more potential and intelligence than you ever have, Michael! More importantly, she is wise beyond her age and kind and *sincere*. *This* child!” He pointed at Braden. “Is as cruel and manipulative as you are. I’ll die before I leave my empire in the hands of someone like that. I love Braden! I love him very much… and because of that, I am trying to save him from growing to be like you!”

“Dad, are you sure about this? This is your Empire we’re talking about.” Stephanie asked him worriedly.

Julius nodded, looking first at Erin who stared at them with wide eyes full of confusion and then at Braden whose eyes were filled with hatred and focused on Erin’s clueless face.

“I’m positive,” said Julius. He looked back at his son. “By tomorrow, my advocate will draw up a brand new will to state that Erin Moore will be the heir to my entire Empire. Michael…”

Raising his furious gaze, Michael settled it on his father,

“If anything,” continued the Chairman. “…and I mean *anything* happens to this little girl, my wealth immediately goes to charity. Understand?”

“You’re fucking kidding me!” spat Michael.

“Oh, I’m not,” said Julius with a smile. “I know you better than you know yourself, son. Harm her and everything goes to the children’s charity. Try to harm me and everything in my will remains as it is and Erin gets it all.”

Stephanie frowned. “Oh, come on, dad. Michael wouldn’t do that.”

“You clearly don’t know your brother,” said the Chairman. “He is capable of anything he can justify in his own insane mind. Your only choice, Michael, is to ensure that Braden grows to be the perfect heir. Only then, will I give him back the position of heir.”

Ignoring his son’s cursing, Julius Stone kicked a sharp piece of the broken vase out of his way and strode towards the stairs.

Desperately, Erin’s mother hurried after him and grasped his sleeve, stopping the chairman’s exit.

“Sir! Please reconsider!” Alicia pleaded, looking up at her boss with teary eyes. She didn’t know what had brought that idea from the chairman but she would be damned if she let him put her Erin in such a dangerous position. The rich were not called filthy for nothing. Who knew what devious ploys they’d come up with to harm Erin? Alicia couldn’t risk it. The Chairman would just have to find someone else to use to straighten out his grandson. “Please, my Erin’s just a little girl and she’s all I have. Please reconsider.”

Julius pursed his lips and eased Alicia’s hands off his suit. “Forgive me, Ms. Moore, but what I have said is final!”

Turning away, he strode off, leaving Erin’s mother to turn to Stephanie in a panic.

“Stephanie, please talk to your father!” pleaded Alicia, wide-eyed. She could barely look at Michael. His glaring eyes were scary as they furiously assessed her and her daughter.

“Calm down, Ms. Moore,” said Stephanie, patting Alicia’s shoulder and rubbing her back. “Just breathe, alright. I know what you’re thinking. Nothing’s going to happen to Erin, I promise.""

Erin’s small shoulders were tense as she watched her mother plead with Stephanie. Her heart was filled with fear, made tense by the dark atmosphere in the house. What was going on? Her mother looked so scared and sad.

Erin’s gaze went to Braden where he sat as still as a marble statue and her eyes widened.

He was staring at her, his eyes barely blinking as he stared and Erin was frightened by the anger clear in his blue orbs. The hatred Braden stared at her with was darker than any he’d ever shown her before and it terrified Erin.

Slowly, she shook her head. Whatever this was, whatever they were fighting over, Erin didn’t want it. Braden was scary and the look he was giving her right now was the scariest Erin had ever seen. Whatever the chairman wanted to give Erin belonged to Braden.

Erin stood up. She didn’t want it.

She turned for the stairs and immediately took off running for the Chairman’s office. She’d talk to him. She’d make him understand. If he wanted to send her and her mother away, it was fine! They’d just have to look for somewhere else to live.

********************

Julius Stone turned away from his window with a heavy sigh and lowered himself into his chair, more exhausted than he’d ever been in all of his fifty-eight years.

Upon the gleaming surface of his table sat a picture of his beloved late wife besides that of their children and Julius sighed at it. “My dear Clara,” he murmured, gazing at the picture of his late wife. “Am I really doing the right thing?”

All of a sudden, the peaceful quiet of his office was shattered as the doors were thrown wide open. In the doorway stood Erin, breathless as she looked at him.

Julius was stunned. “Little g—”

“I don’t want it!”

He stilled, narrowing his eyes. “Pardon?”

Erin slowly walked into the huge office, her knees wobbling just a little bit but she stood firm. “I… I don’t want it, Sir!”

“And what would ‘it’ be?”

“What belongs to Braden,” said Erin with zero hesitation. “You said you’d give me what was Braden’s and now he hates me even more! He’ll be even more mean to me! And my mom is so scared about it! Please, Sir, I don’t want it!”

Julius studied the child for a moment and then quietly steepled his fingers atop the table. “Little girl. Do you not understand what this will mean for you and your mother?”

Erin swallowed, her fingers clutching at the long skirt of her dress. She had no clue what it meant for her and her mom, but it couldn’t be a good thing when her mom was so scared.

“From now on,” said the Chairman. “…I will make sure that you attend the best schools. Isn’t that great? You’ll go to school where Braden goes and experience the life of a billionaire heiress. Do you not want to have that?”

Erin was shocked. “I have… I have to go to school with Braden?” The thought was terrifying! She immediately rushed up to the Chairman’s table and stood on the tips of her toes so he could clearly see her face over his stacked folders. “Please, don’t send me there! Please!”

Julius was dumbfounded. “What? Why—”

“Braden hates me! And I have my friend, Jackson, at school, I can’t leave him! Please, Sir, just don’t do it.”

Julius was flustered by the child’s tears. She really didn’t understand what a great opportunity this was? Leaning forward, he held up a calming hand. “Now, now, little girl, listen to me. Intelligence like yours must be nurtured! Now just calm down and think about it. Braden’s a really bad child, isn’t he? If you only help me make him become like you… I promise, you can have anything you want!”

Erin shook her head. “No, my mom’s scared!”

“She has nothing to be scared about,” the Chairman assured her, surprised to find himself in actual desperation to convince this little girl to help him. She was literally his last choice. Braden truly did not like her and, because he was as arrogant as his father, he was likely to do all that the Chairman said in order to make sure that Erin never got what was rightfully his. That’s what Julius needed.

“I promise that if you help me make Braden like you… your mom will never be scared like that again.”

Erin stilled and slowly the Chairman nodded. He had her attention. “That’s right. And not just that, but also… she won’t have to be a maid anymore. I’ll give her a beautiful house to live in on this estate and you can live there with her. Everything you need, I will provide. If only you help me.”

Erin stood extremely still, staring at the Chairman. He was… he was serious. Thoughts started rushing through Erin’s mind so fast she could barely focus on one for long before another came whizzing by.

Really? Her mother didn’t have to be a maid anymore? So Braden and his father would never insult her or boss her around again? And she, Erin, could live elsewhere with her mom and not here with Braden?

Would the Chairman really, truly do that? She raised her gaze to meet his and the Chairman nodded, his eyes full of confidence.

“Trust me, little girl,” he said.

Erin’s fingers curled into her palms, the nails digging into her hands. “How…” she began. “How do I make him more like me? We’re so different…”

Julius Stone nearly sighed in relief as some of the anxiousness eased from his heart. “I promise it’ll be easy for you,” he told her. “All you have to do is learn, behave and grow up well enough to become heir to an empire. That will make Braden also behave and grow well. You’ll go to school, have friends, the normal life. But better.”

Erin stared at him. “My mom doesn’t have to be a maid?”

Julius nodded. “That’s correct.”

Suddenly, Alicia appeared frantically in the doorway, her searching eyes landing on Erin and growing wider. “Erin!” She looked at the Chairman as she entered and took a hold of Erin’s hand. “I’m so sorry, Sir!” She hesitated for a moment. “Sir… about your decision, I really cannot allow that you—”

“I’ll do it, mommy!” Erin announced.

Alicia looked down at her daughter in shock. “No, honey! You don’t even understand—”

“I do,” said Erin firmly. “I help Chairman make Braden behave like me and you don’t have to be a maid anymore. I’ll do it.” She looked at the Chairman. “I promise.”
 
Chapter 5
***8 years later***

“Erin?!” came the shout from downstairs.

“Yes, mom?!” she yelled back.

“I’m leaving, honey! I didn’t make breakfast, so come down to the main house to eat before you leave, okay?”

“Okay!”

The sound of the front door slamming closed echoed through the house and Erin sighed.

She stood in her bedroom, before her closet mirror, studying herself in the uniform.

First day of senior year. Whoopie.

She should have been happy, overjoyed even, because this, at least, was the last year of high school, after which she would finally be free!

Sadly, all happy thoughts were killed by the knowledge that once more, Erin had to get through an entire year of being in the same class as Braden bloody Stone and his jackass friends!

Leaning towards the mirror, she added another clip to the high bun she’d twisted her thick chestnut brown hair into and quickly adjusted her bangs. Erin tilted her head, quirking her mouth up on one side to see her single dimple. “Okay, we’re good,” she muttered to herself, smoothing her hands down the front of her blazer.

Three hours. That’s all they had before the school bell rang and the vacation was officially over. Erin bit her lip, blinking back tears at how sad it all was.

Grabbing her bag, she threw it over her shoulder and took a final look in the mirror. This year’s senior uniforms had rather short skirts. Frowning, Erin gave the hem a tug before dusting the shoulder of her green blazer and heading for the door.

The click of her black school heels sounded down the stairs until she reached the front door and stepped out onto the vast green terrain.

Looking, as she always did, at the magnificent view that stretched forth around the Stone estate, Erin drew in a lungful of fresh morning air.

This morning seemed different from others. The air smelled of school and homework and tests and, suddenly, she didn’t want to breathe it in so deeply anymore.

“To hell with school,” were her words. The words Erin would have said if she wasn’t bound by a contract. Tucking her hands into her blazer pockets, Erin started down the stone path that led to the main part of the estate where the glorious Stone mansion stood.

For the past eight years, she had done all that the Chairman had expected of her. She’d taken up all of Braden’s tutorial classes at home with him, she’d gone for the “billionaire” extra-curricular activities they’d told her to go for, not that Erin was complaining. It was nice to ride horses and learn how to play golf and go on vacations to the Stone Hotel Retreats.

That was all good, especially because Erin got to do it with her mother and Stephanie.

What wasn’t great was the amount of work she had to complete for both the academy and their home tutoring. Erin was intelligent, but just barely enough to endure the workload. Most of the time, she was chasing deadlines and gulping down coffee.

Worst of all, however, was what she had to go through being in contact with Braden nearly every single day.

Over the past eight years, there was not one insult, not one threat in all of existence that she had not heard from Braden Stone.

He said whatever he wanted to her and didn’t give a damn whether it hurt her or not.

Thank God Erin had a mouth of her own and Braden got as good as he gave. She would not be a pushover in front of that boy, she refused to allow it! She knew all too well how much he hated her and wanted her gone, but Braden didn’t seem to realize that Erin wasn’t dying to be friends with him either. She hated him just as much.

Reaching the back of the Stone house, Erin slipped in through the back entrance, greeting servants as she went.

“Erin, you’re here!” said Stella, the kind lady who’d replaced her mother as Cook once Alicia had been promoted to a Housekeeping position to oversee the host of servants that Stephanie had decided to hire.

“Morning, Ms. Lee,” greeted Erin sweetly, leaning over the kitchen counter to kiss the lady’s cheek. “Where’s mom?”",1,1751533255.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

# Best Magnet Dancer 2025: Reviews & Top choices

The Magnet Dancer is a interesting piece of kinetic art and a elegant desk toy that provides visual stimulation and stress relief. These devices use magnets to create an illusion of a dancing figure that responds to external stimuli, offering a form of interactive art suitable for offices, homes, and educational settings. The quality of materials, design, and responsiveness to magnetic fields varies across models, making careful evaluation necessary to select the most engaging and durable option.

## Key Features Analysis

The best magnet dancers stand out based on several key features that impact their overall performance and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Quality**

The base and figure materials significantly impact the dancer’s stability, durability, and visual appeal. High-quality dancers often utilize polished hardwoods such as maple or walnut for the base, contributing to a premium look and feel. The figures themselves can be constructed from lightweight metals like aluminum or stainless steel, ensuring longevity and resistance to wear.Lower quality versions may use plastic bases, which can compromise stability and scratch easily.The use of premium materials enhances the product’s lifespan and aesthetic appeal.

**Magnetic Strength and Design**

The strength and arrangement of magnets within the base and figure are crucial for achieving a dynamic and responsive dance. high-performing dancers utilize powerful neodymium magnets precisely positioned to create a balanced magnetic field.This allows for smooth,graceful movements in response to external magnetic forces. the magnetic design should allow for a wide range of motion without causing the figure to detach from the base unintentionally. Accurate magnet placement and quality determine the fluidness and unpredictability that define the experience.

**Base Design and Stability**

The base's dimensions and weight distribution play a critical role in the stability of the magnet dancer. A wider, heavier base provides a lower center of gravity, preventing the dancer from tipping over during more vigorous movements. The base should also feature non-slip padding to prevent it from sliding on smooth surfaces. Intricately designed bases can add an element of visual appeal, harmonizing with the figure's artistic style.

**Figure Articulation and Range of Motion**

The figure's design influences its range of motion and the variety of poses it can achieve, hence the articulation of its limbs. More sophisticated models feature multiple articulation points, allowing for a wider array of dynamic movements compared to simpler designs with limited flexibility. The figure's weight distribution should be optimized to ensure balance and prevent it from collapsing under its own weight.The figure should allow for free-flowing,natural-looking dance movements.

**Sensitivity Tuning**

Some advanced models offer adjustable sensitivity settings that allow users to fine-tune the dancer’s response to magnetic fields. This customization can be achieved through adjustable magnet placement or electronic controls,allowing users to tailor the experience to their preferences. Higher sensitivity settings produce more exaggerated movements,while lower settings provide more subdued responses. Sensitivity tuning ensures versatile experience.

**Power Source and Battery Life (If Applicable)**

Some advanced magnet dancers incorporate electronic components, such as electromagnets. These models require a power source, either in the form of batteries or an AC adapter. For battery-operated models, long battery life is essential for uninterrupted operation. The power source should be easily accessible and the charging process should be convenient. Battery life limitations depend on power demands.

Key features of a top-rated magnet dancer include:

*   Premium materials (wood, metal)
*   Strong neodymium magnets
*   Stable and weighted base
*   Articulated figure
*   sensitivity tuning

## FAQs Section

**Can magnet dancers be used safely around electronic devices?**

While most magnet dancers utilize relatively weak magnetic fields, it's best to keep them a safe distance from sensitive electronic devices such as hard drives, credit cards, and pacemakers. Strong magnets can perhaps interfere with their operation, so it's always best to err on the side of caution. The recommended distance is typically at least 12 inches.

**What types of surfaces are suitable for displaying a magnet dancer?**

The magnet dancer can be displayed on any flat, stable surface. However, it's best to avoid placing it on uneven or vibrating surfaces, as this can disrupt the delicate balance and cause the figure to fall. A smooth, non-slip surface is ideal for optimal performance. Some models include non-slip pads on the bass to avoid unnecessary sliding.

**How durable are magnet dancers?**

The durability of a magnet dancer depends on the quality of materials and construction. High-quality models with metal figures and sturdy bases can withstand years of use with proper care. However, cheaper versions may be more prone to damage, particularly if exposed to excessive force or moisture.Avoid dropping the product from heights or applying excessive forces to minimize risk.

**Can the magnetic field strength be adjusted?**

Some high-end magnet dancers incorporate adjustable magnetic field strength settings that allow users to fine-tune the dancer's responsiveness. These adjustments can be made via controls (electronic or manual), giving users precise control over the magnetic display.

1lqkqhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lqkqhe/my_first_digital_bond_epiphany/,My first digital bond epiphany,"Just thought I’d share some back story.

It’s 1999. I’m working at the BBC (not news) and they send me to Cannes for some festival or other. It’s mid-morning and everyone is either networking or huddled in business “lounges” trying to plug Ethernet cables into their clunky laptops for connection.

And then there’s me with an idea. I left the convention center, crossed the road and ordered a coffee at a cafe on the beach with a gorgeous view of sand and ocean. I took my new Nokia 8110 banana phone (the Matrix had just made it the coolest phone in the world at the time), and placed it alongside a slimline HP laptop. After some fiddling I got the IR port on the phone (infrared, like a remote control) to talk to the laptop at 9.6kps (about as fast as getting a VFS appointment). I needed a security dongle to connect to the BBC’s internal desktop and then voila, I was downloading email headers (no body text or images) a world away from the office and without any wires. 

A million countries and startups later and I still love a nice beach (and 5G). But I don’t do emails any more of course. 

I wonder where and how we’ll all be working in another 25 years… ",2,1751532947.0,digitalnomad,1,1.0,False

It was crowdy but manageable. At noon, I went to the Hiltl restaurant to grab a bite to eat — there was quite a queue and it seemed that restaurant could not keep up with the customer's pace — many of the trays with food on offer were empty. I took what was available (not what I had planned) and at the cash register terminal, I was asked to leave a tip. By the way, at Hiltl Mithenquai, cashiers do not make coffee or drinks.

My high Ne - In addition to the test results - (my Ne has always been higher than Fi, although Si, for example, was third) It is easily noticeable in communication, when I can easily come up with a topic for discussion out of nowhere, come up with my own  theory for fun out of thin air or from words spoken by a person, when I am working on projects (I literally do not write a script and make concepts, characters and lore on the fly) I easily understand the motives of the characters and new concepts and theories on the fly the first time, my brain quickly figures out how and what relates to what and this partially helps me come up with plots and concepts. I am quite a talkative person, and constantly jump from topic to topic, I have a lot to talk about 
I have many ideas and projects, of which I have not done any one - usually I jump from one to another, if not do a new one at all

although I am passive in life and do little physically 

( about my Si ) I remember a lot, I remember many memories from childhood, I have my own sentimental moments not directly related to the situation, I often feel nostalgic and miss my childhood, I remember my past perception very well and how I noticed and perceived incomprehensible moments in childhood, I remember my sensations and feelings that I experienced (by the way, when I experienced fear, I remembered this feeling , I have impressions and my own emotions of lived memories that are detached from an objective view of the past, and I remember what fantasies I had in childhood and what I thought about then, because in principle I have always been a homebody since childhood and thought and dreamed a lot.

And it's also funny how I can systematically do something and get distracted, for example, I was watching a video on YouTube (thinking how I could express this idea in my genre or why I thought about it at all, recalling my thoughts in the past and past ideas that came to me while watching videos) and didn't even notice that I was making dough for PIZZA although I didn't want to make dough at all, I wanted to make another dish, but it was as if I completely switched off - or when I poured water back into the kettle instead of making coffee, because I was thinking about writing my story

I noticed a tendency that when I'm scared or when I'm stressed - I run away, hide, come back - whenever I'm full of doubts or a lot of pressure from the outside - I returned to old YouTubers or hobbies, when teachers pressured me at school, I endured for a long time but eventually ran to the toilets and locked myself there so as not to hear the screams in my direction, when I was in an uncomfortable environment - I literally ran away. 

My Fi - I am not a judgmental person and can understand a person by putting myself in his place, I have personal concepts of morality that many can condemn - but this is simply empathy on a personal level, relating to a specific person and his world, his thoughts, his emotions, and I deeply adhere to this, because I do not want a person to be judged as a shell of his actions and always judged by motives and where they came from and why actions, I take other people's problems close to heart and immediately remember similar states, because I also experienced many experiences in my time

At this moment, I heard cries for help from outside. At first, I ignore them. Probably some kind of prank from some brat around here. But the cries, they get louder and louder! I grumble inwardly but still choose to stand up and go outside. 

What I see is a girl around my age being harassed by some street gang. At first, I want to call my friend, the Don of the bread mafia, but no. I am a barbarian! Why take the long and cumbersome route when you can just bash their heads in! 

I stride forward, nearly leaving afterimages behind. I brace my two sealed artifacts. With one, I let the darkness around me surge and churn, as it's being molded into bats.

*they are not worthy of my attention any longer*. It seems the girl has long fainted due to the... violence.

I was looking this week about doing a trip in the new year on my own. I'm looking at 4-5 nights away. I mentioned my plan to my gf and she said she thinks it's weird that I want to go away on my own when I'm in a relationship.

I pointed out being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to do everything together. She asked what it would mean for our trips and I said it'll just mean we only have one holiday next year. 

She said our trips shouldn't be reduced just because I decide to go away but I just reminded her we haven't even got anything planned for next year so it's not like I'm cancelling already made plans. 

She just said I shouldn't be doing it and that going away on my own isn't something I should be considering when I'm in a relationship.

I've been using my Normcore portafilter (with a wooden handle) for almost a year now and just 2 months ago I noticed my handle came off quite easily. It seems like the glue or whatever is used (to keep the basket and the handle together) no longer works, which makes the handle loosen more easily. I live in Southeast Asia with high humidity, hence I suspect it might be one of the reasons. I also noticed the same thing happened to my coffee stirrer (also from Normcore): the main body (made of walnut) also comes off quite easily.

I will purchase a new handle to replace the current one. Although the wooden handle looks aesthetically pleasing, I will need to switch to a different material just to make sure that it will stay intact for years.

## What is Lucente Nexor?

Lucente Nexor is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and CFDs. The main hook? It uses AI algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf.

In plain English: it’s like hiring a robot to do your trading for you—one that (supposedly) never sleeps, panics, or needs coffee. The idea is to make trading accessible and more efficient, especially for people who don’t have the time or expertise to stare at charts all day.

## Who Created Lucente Nexor?

This is where things get a little vague. There’s **no single founder or team** prominently listed on the official site. That’s usually a red flag, but it’s also pretty common in the world of auto-trading platforms. Most of them, including Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge, operate under a similar shroud of mystery.

That said, based on domain records and some digging, it seems Lucente Nexor is backed by a team of developers and financial analysts who’ve supposedly worked with other trading software. Take that with a grain of salt, but the platform itself seems well-built and operative.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Lucente Nexor Today](https://tinyurl.com/296uosxe)

Once the system identifies a promising trade, it can either notify you or automatically execute the trade—depending on your settings. You can choose between manual trading or full automation, which is great for both beginners and more hands-on traders.

The AI reportedly improves its performance over time, learning from market movements to make smarter decisions. While it’s not magic, it does save a lot of time and emotional stress.

## Lucente Nexor Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down:

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Automated trading** saves time and reduces emotional decisions.

To be honest, I don’t have many friends around yet, and while my colleagues at work are great, I prefer to keep work relationships professional. So I'm hoping to meet like-minded people outside the office!

A little about me:

I’m a big fan of Netflix, from binge-worthy shows to chill movie nights.

 I love reading fiction, getting lost in a good book is my kind of therapy.

I enjoy exploring cafés, whether it’s trying new coffee spots or just hanging out in cozy corners with a book or good conversation.

Concluding if you are also in the same boat as me and wanna meet new people and hangout sometime, feel free to shoot a dm

I live a bit far from her and so when I dropped her off she said to text her when i got home safe. dropped her off at 9:45, texted her i got home at 11pm, she responded to my text at 2am.
