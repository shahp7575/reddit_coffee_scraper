I applied for my mother's subclass 600 since August and finally heard something back from them on 29th of Nov. It's a s57 Natural Justice and I will now have to respond to them.

In my invitation letter, I have mentioned that I have no seen my mother for over six years. Last time I saw her was 2017 back in my country. My mother has never been to Australia. They are saying that this information is false and that the information before the department shows that she has seen me in 2022.

This is completely false and truly confusing. I am not sure where they got this information from. They didn't detail how they got this false information and when I called them, the person on the line said ""I cannot reveal as this is invasion of privacy."" 

I am truly confused, unless I sleepwalked onto a plane, went to my country, met my mom and sleep walked back, there is no way I have seen her in 2022.

In 2022, my mother in fact got her visa rejected to come to my wedding. After this, I went to Singapore for my honeymoon. Are they assuming that my mom and I met in Singapore? Our passports are new and does not have travel proof from 2022. 

I will be replying to this soon and would love some information on how to go about this if you guys have experience. I cannot believe the department has just made this claim without showing me or giving me any solid proof. To add insult to injury, they even added that my mother has made up false claims to help her application look good. 

At this point, I am tempted to find out if I can take legal action against the Department of Home Affairs. 

It is so incredibly frustrating how some people can come in, pour hot coffee on a baby and leave but some people cannot come visit their first new born grandchild for Christmas.

People came up to me and told me about many unfortunate things that he has been doing. One of which included putting hateful comments on my friend‚Äôs posts who I was in that short rebound with. But, I have no way to prove any of these claims, so I take it all with a grain of salt.

**I (38F) have been keeping a secret from my (43F) friend/coworker about her (42M) husband, and it's tearing me apart. How do I navigate this without destroying lives?**

&#x200B;

Hello Reddit. This has been weighing on my conscience for over a year now, and I'm honestly not sure how to handle it. It's long, so settle in, grab a tea/coffee/whiskey and enjoy my mental anguish.

I (38f) met my friend Dave (42m) about 4 years ago in an online gaming forum. During the entire time we talked, I became friends with his wife Brenda (43f), and he became friends with my fianc√© Mikel (38m). I live by the rule in a relationship that if there is conversation that I wouldn't feel comfortable showing my significant other, then I don't need to be having that conversation. At no point did Dave ever cross a line with me, nor was there ever inappropriate conversation. This is important.

About a year and a half ago (summertime) Mikel got a big promotion and we hosted a fun weekend long celebration at our home. We invited Dave and Brenda, who live 5 hours from us, and this was the first time we actually met them in person. I instantly connected with Brenda, as she was so authentic and sweet. We all got along well, and even started talking about doing future get-togethers and vacations. It seemed perfect. At this time my company was doing major layoffs and I was looking for a new career. Brenda has worked at a remote company for over a decade and recommended I apply. After a few intense interviews, I was hired.

Quick side note: Dave had been injured in work related accident that had gone to court, he sued and won. He was permanently disabled because of the accident and can no longer work at his profession. That, along with a large life insurance policy from his parents, he is financially set for life. He stays home and raises their daughter Lia (5), while Brenda does her remote work from the house as well.

So, a little over a year ago (during the fall, a few months after the celebration weekend) Dave and Brenda were getting ready to take their daughter Lia (5) on a vacation. Before they left for the airport, Dave said he needed to talk to me, it was urgent, so I stepped away to take the call. Dave then told me he had literally nobody else to talk to this about, and was deeply depressed, and needed to confide in me as a friend. I.. really wish he hadn't.

He told me that the night before he had gotten into a huge fight with who he calls his best friend, Rachel (41f). I had heard about Rachel but never met her, and didn't know too much about her, to be honest. What I did know: Dave, Brenda and Rachel had been friends in college (approximately 20 year long friendship), she had visited at Dave and Brenda's house several times over the years, and that Rachel allegedly had been in a string of bad relationships of which Dave had had to bail her out financially a few times. That's about it.

Here comes the information that I wish Dave hadn't told me, as it has completely changed how I view my friend: Dave told me that Rachel confessed to him the night before that she knew he was attracted to her. Yes, she is gorgeous. Dave said he has always been attracted to her physically, but mentally her personality (specifically her shallowness) was a huge turnoff for him. Some unkind things were said about Brenda ""letting herself go"" since having Lia, which disgusted me. He then said Rachel confessed that she is frustrated with her never-ending chain of bad relationships and wants to finally settle down. She knows he is wealthy and can give her the life she feels she deserves. She wants him to leave Brenda and Lia, move to Rachel's city, buy her a large house, and let her be his trophy wife. (I choked back a laugh at this because I literally thought it was a joke. Seriously?) She admits to NOT being physically attracted to him (Okay, who says things like that?!), but knows she can satisfy him and he can give her the lifestyle she deserves. She just demands that he has to completely cut off the life he has now, including all friends and family, and be with her. What is worse, Rachel has been planning this for literally YEARS. Sitting in their home, eating their food, drinking their wine, holding Lia, laughing with Brenda, all while planning this.

I was floored. I asked what Brenda thought of all this. He said he didn't tell her. I asked him how Rachel took it when he told her to F- off. He said he didn't. He doesn't want to lose her as a friend and he even considered her proposition. I felt sick.

I told him I was shocked, and to me, even if he decides not to take Rachel up on it, this is a betrayal to Brenda. Dave explained that while his and my conversations consisted of gaming, stupid memes, and planning potential couples vacations, his conversations with Rachel were emotional and raw. They spoke for hours on end, every single day, while he was caring for Lia, and while Brenda was working in the next room. Ok, ewwwww. Stop.

He asked my opinion, and I told him he has 2 options: either leave Brenda, or completely break off all contact with Rachel and focus on his marriage.. but since he asked, in my opinion Brenda needed to know. Especially since she considered Rachel a friend, and knowing that Rachel wants to screw over Brenda and Lia. Seriously typing this disgusts me.

After the call ended I told Mikel about it. He was as shocked as I was, but asked what I was going to do. I just sat there trying to digest what I had just heard.

Dave, Brenda and Lia went on their vacation. During this time we didn't communicate. When he got back he told me that he had cut Rachel off, but refused to tell Brenda about it. Ok, fine whatever. I don't agree with his action to not tell her, but It's not my life, not my relationship. He asked for advice and I gave it. I told him that in my eyes, he had betrayed his wife, whether physically or not, and I still felt that Brenda deserved to know.

Almost immediately I felt myself pulling away from Dave. My image of him was damaged. When I interact with Brenda online for work, I'm professional and friendly, but it's painful keeping this secret. However, as time passed I began to think that perhaps this was over. Dave had just made a stupid mistake and was just thinking about what could be. He didn't actually leave her, right? And most importantly, he cut Rachel out.

Dave and I begin talking a bit more. I actually thought maybe things can go back to the way they were. Since didn't actually physically cheat, maybe it's best that Brenda doesn't know, for her own mental health and happiness. Maybe we can move past this. So many thoughts going through my mind. SO many ways of rationalizing this. The mental gymnastics were Olympics level impressive.

Then about a month ago he drops the bomb. He tells me that Rachel and he are talking again. She allegedly begged him for forgiveness, and cried that she is going through another horrible breakup and needs his friendship, or else she ""doesn't know what she might do"". He said he is going to keep her at arms length, but SHE NEEEEEDS HIM. He will just be there for her a little bit, but it won't be like it was before. Oh holy knight...

To my chagrin (love that word), as the weeks pass he begins to mention her more and more. I tell him I don't want to hear about her, and when he keeps going I finally snap and tell him not to mention her to me at all. I'm so pissed that he is talking to her again, and that he doesn't care about how me knowing this is putting more guilt and strain in my mind especially when I have to interact with HIS WIFE. It's completely unfair that he told me about his ""situationship"" with Rachel, knowing that I consider Brenda a friend, and that we work together EVERY DAY. I've begged him to tell Brenda about it. She has the right to decide if she wants to stay. And most of all that he is actively still friends with a woman who wishes hurt and pain on his wife and little girl. How do you sleep at night sir...

Dave still talks about planning vacations together with Mikel and I, but I don't even respond. Honestly I don't see how I can sit at dinner with them and keep quiet, especially if Rachel were to get brought up in conversation, and especially if wine is involved. and let's be honest, there WILL BE WINE. I have one of those faces that speaks my mind without saying a word, which is why I do better working remote, vs client facing.

I dread the day when/if either Dave or Brenda say that Rachel is coming to visit them again. I can pretend it won't happen, but let's be honest. Dave is a complete moron who managed to somehow miraculously prevent his marriage from going up in flames, only to soak himself in gasoline and open the door to the walking, talking, ""gorgeous yet shallow"" lit match.

Reddit: help me. I want to cut him out completely because I am so disgusted by his actions, but I know Brenda will be upset and drill me about it. Especially since they have been planning a trip to Europe for next year and wanting us to come. Should I just tell her that we had a falling out? Should I find a way to hint to Brenda not to trust Rachel? I didn't even want to know ANY of this, and I'm so pissed that he dumped this on me. We were friends, but not that type of friend.

As for Brenda, I would want to know if I were friends with and playing host to a girl who wanted to steal my husband, and the father of my child. But I'm also concerned about my job, my livelihood. She's been with the company over 10 years and I've only been a year. I've kept this secret from her for so long. If I say something, can it affect my employment? Should I just pull away from them and when asked make some lame excuse like I am too busy?

TLDR: Friend confides in me that he is considering leaving his marriage for mutual friend of theirs. Decides not to and cuts friend out. However, recently started up friendship with this girl again. His wife is a friend and coworker of mine.

EDIT: I wanted to clarify a few things:

When I say ""friend"" I mean we are more than mere acquaintances, but we aren't ""besties"". I've always been closer to Dave than Brenda strictly because he's the one who I game with. However, Dave and I never had deep conversations before he unloaded this secret on me. We talked about LoTR, Harry Potter, going to festivals, and eventually us joining them on vacations (we haven't so far). Money was too tight for us to join them before Mikel's promotion, and before I was given this job opportunity, so vacations were something for the future. We've only ever met once in person, for the promotion weekend last summer, but have continuously made plans to visit, or meet up in the city. Due to funds and other hiccups, the plans always fell through. Our ""friendship"" was something that we had built to get away from the stress of life. Lighthearted and meant to be fun. As for Brenda, she recommended me for the position at her work but I had to earn the position. She isn't my boss, but she definitely has seniority. Before the conversation with Dave, I had high hopes for Brenda and I becoming closer and us all being good friends down the road. Unfortunately since this happened last year, I have kept my distance and didn't nurture my relationship with Brenda.

I have NO proof. The conversation where he told me everything was over the phone, and I didn't record it. Plus I'm in a 2 party state, so I think I could get in trouble for that. If I tell Brenda it will be my word against his. And if she goes to him, he can deny everything, or even try to spin it against me. (This is where I worry it could affect my job)

My job is my biggest concern at this point. I do NOT want to lose my job. I don't want my job to become awkward. I would love to be able to give Brenda a heads up about the situation, but also I can't afford to lose my job. I cannot stress this enough. If I knew I could warn her without harming my own situation, I would.

It may sound like my mind is made up, but it's not. I just wanted to add those for clarification and hopes that there is something that can be done.

**Dear\_Parsnip\_6802**

*You give him 1 week to tell her or you will. Tell him that he is emotionally cheating on his wife and she deserves to know so she can decide if hes worth staying with. You let him know that you gave him the opportunity to make things right by cutting off Rachel and he chose not to. He chose to disrespect his wife by continuing to have a relationship with someone who wants to cause her harm.*

*I'd be honest and let him know the fact that he would even entertain Rachel's offer of a superficial relationship where she'll have sex with him in exchange for money (that's what her offer amounts to) and him abandoning his little girl disgusts you and you have lost respect for him as a person.*

*Time to be firm about it. Either way your friendship with him is over so you may as well be a girls girl and let his wife know what she's married to. At least Rachel will not step foot back in their home.*

>OOP: Thank you! This is exactly how I feel. I think I needed to hear this from someone outside the situation.

**ButterflyWings71**

*great advice & make copies off all online conversations, texts, etc in case he tries to erase or edit them. That way he can‚Äôt twist things or lie about anything and if there is divorce, Brenda will have proof to smoke his a$$ in a divorce. And if he is stupid enough to get his trophy wife, she prob bankrupt him in a few years.*

**Update - 4 days later**

&#x200B;

ÔªøHello Reddit. First of all I want to send a huge thank you to all who took the time to read and comment on my post. I read all of your replies and took most into consideration.

I mentioned that I would wait until after thanksgiving to make my decision as I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the holiday for Brenda and Lia. During that time I decided that if I lose my job then it would suck, but I know I can get another. I have to do what‚Äôs right, and what is also best for my mental health.

Yesterday with Mikel‚Äôs support, I sent out a group message to them both saying ‚ÄúHope you guys had a happy Thanksgiving!‚Äù To my surprise Brenda replied with ‚Äúyeah not so much.‚Äù

I asked what happened, and she said that Rachels mom was in the hospital with pneumonia and Dave went to be with her for moral support, and that she was left hosting alone. Dave didn‚Äôt reply.

Mikel told me that this was the perfect time, and he would support me whatever I chose to do. So I sent ‚ÄúI‚Äôm amazed how forgiving you are Brenda. I don‚Äôt think I could be so chill.‚Äù

Dave replied with ‚Äú?????‚Äù, but Brenda immediately called me and I put her on speaker. She asked what I meant and I said ‚Äúafter what happened last year.. with Dave and Rachel. Before you guys left for vacation.‚Äù

She told me to go on; and that‚Äôs when I knew he had not in fact told her. So I told her EVERYTHING. I also told her I was sorry, and had tried to convince him to tell her, but that I didn‚Äôt know if anything more had happened so maybe there is a chance to fix this.

I told her that since Rachel was back in their lives, I assumed they moved past it, maybe since they‚Äôve been close friends since college. She seemed eerily calm, and said something like ‚Äúuh no, Rachel never went to college. She met Dave online about ten years ago. She‚Äôs never been to college or even had a real job.‚Äù

She asked if there was anything else. Reddit, I started freaking out, lost any remaining confidence I had, and told her that the reason I hadn‚Äôt said anything was because I didn‚Äôt have any proof and since working with her I had been worried to say anything about it because I didn‚Äôt want to risk my job, but not anymore. I was SPIRALING.

Brenda said she had to go and hung up. I just sat there feeling sick.

Two whole hours later Brenda called me back. Some of you called it. When confronting Dave and Rachel, they told her that I had actually propositioned him, and that I was jealous of his and Rachel‚Äôs friendship, and I wanted what Brenda had. I started shaking and crying.

At this point Mikel interrupted her and said he had heard parts of the original conversation. Not all, but enough to know that what I had told him afterward was the truth. She tried interrupting him but he cut her off. He said that this had been tearing me up and he was sick of it, he wished her the best, and hoped she could remain professional at work, but after this call he wants Dave out of our life for good. Then he hung up.

About thirty minutes later I got a text from Brenda. She apologized for us being dragged into this, said she‚Äôs mortified that I know, and says Mikel didn‚Äôt let her finish. She was just telling us what they said, and then she drops this epic bombshell: she already knows what‚Äôs up, and has since last year. She just had no idea until then that I knew. Y‚Äôall get cookies if you called that, btw.

She says the way he acted last year on the vacation, like a heartbroken lovesick puppy, was a HUGE red flag, and she felt deep down something wasn‚Äôt right with him and Rachel.

As soon as they got back home she started digging, looking through his computer, his phone, and iPad. It‚Äôs not just Rachel, there‚Äôs more. She‚Äôs the only one he‚Äôs met up with. None of the others wanted him in person; just his money.

I asked if she‚Äôs okay or if she‚Äôs worried about Dave coming back, but Brenda said she already has a lawyer and has been spending the past several months getting her affairs in order. She was going to give him the divorce papers after Thanksgiving, but with him abandoning them like that, she instead took advantage of his absence to change the locks and start packing his stuff. My information along with their lies just made it easier for her. This chick is SO much more badass than I knew. I don‚Äôt know if changing locks is legal but good for her I guess.

She apologized again for Dave and I told her I was sorry I didn‚Äôt say something earlier. She told me that if she didn‚Äôt already know about Dave, and hadn‚Äôt read a lot of our messages (which she said were pretty boring, ouch lol) she probably wouldn‚Äôt have believed me. It was an impossible situation. I told her that if she needs to talk we are here. If not, then I‚Äôll just be her coworker. Either way, I‚Äôm done with Dave. Fuck Dave.

1h4ocar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDrewCareyShow/comments/1h4ocar/series_restoration_season_6_complete/,Series Restoration: Season 6 complete,"As of this evening, I've completed the reconstruction of season 6, and all the episodes are available for download. I've also gone back and made corrections/adjustments to episodes from previous seasons as well, so depending on when you downloaded, you may want to replace the following episodes with the newer versions:  
**S02E20** \- Removed ABC logo  
**S04E15** \- Added subtitles  
**S05E09** \- Added pre-episode tag

Here are the episodes from season 6 that contain additional footage from older airings:  
**S06E10 - ""Buzzie Wuzzie Liked His Beer""** (52 seconds added from TBS version) Added jokes and extended/alternate takes - Video 8/10, Audio 5/10  
**S06E16 - ""Drew and the Baby""** (55 seconds added from TBS version) - Outtakes only. Video 7/10 & 2/10, Audio 4/10  
**S06E17 - ""Hush Little Baby""** (5 seconds added from TBS version) - One extended moment, and one extra joke. Video 9/10, Audio 8.5/10  
**S06E22 - ""The Easter Show""** (24 seconds added from TBS version) - Additional scene in cold open. Video 7.5/10, Audio 7/10  
**S06E25 - ""Drew and the Activist, Part II""** (57 seconds added from TBS version) - Added jokes and extended/alternate takes. Video 6.5/10, Audio 3/10  
**S06E27 - ""Bananas, Part II""**¬†(37 seconds added from original ABC broadcast) - Extended end credits. Video 6/10, Audio, 7/10

Note on S06E27: It was brought to my attention that S06E26 & S06E27 were originally aired as a single hour-long episode. After being sent a copy of the original broadcast from a VHS rip, I confirmed the only content that was cut for syndication was the announcement of the April Fools contest winner at the end of the episode. The main version I uploaded has this portion added back in. (As usual, I did what I could to enhance the quality of the video, but there's only so much that can be done with a VHS rip.)

It's worth noting that season 6 is the last of the 4:3 (non-widescreen) seasons. I'm looking forward to putting out 16:9 HD content going forward, but I also know that there is no Plex version of S07E01-E03. This means I'll have to use the RewTV widescreen broadcasts to reconstruct the first three episodes of season 7, but correcting the speed & frame rate while also attempting to remove the station logo will be a very tedious, manual process.

Up to this point, I've been completing and uploading multiple episodes every day, but I've known since I started this project that this particular batch of episodes would the most challenging to reconstruct, so your patience is appreciated. I believe the end result will be worth the wait.

Finally, on a personal note: a big part of the reason I've been able to devote so much time and effort to this reconstruction/restoration project is because I was laid off from my job in September. This project is helping to fill my days as I continue searching for my next role, and I hope it brings you all a little joy. If anyone would like to buy me a coffee to keep some fuel in my tank, your kindness is appreciated: [https://ko-fi.com/djpitab](https://ko-fi.com/djpitab)

","**Four Years Ago (Context)**

I (23F) moved to a major city in my country after uni to live with my then-partner, Joel (29M). Two of my uni friends, Emily (23F) and Erin (23F), also moved to the city that same year. I had finished uni and was working full-time. I‚Äôd been in a relationship with Joel for only a few months before moving, and, looking back, it was a terrible decision. There were so many red flags, but I ignored them.

Emily and Erin were both single, and the three of us started hanging out all the time after not seeing each other for a while. (I‚Äôd finished uni via distance.) At the time, I was closer to both of them than they were to each other, though they had met briefly after I left to finish my degree off-campus.

*What Happened with Emily and Joel*

Emily and Erin were over at my place every now and then, and they got to know Joel. They always told me he was great‚Äîgood-looking, successful, and friendly. We all spent a lot of time together. At the time, I felt like they liked him more than I did, which didn‚Äôt surprise me because Joel was charming and had a ton of friends. Women would regularly flirt with him right in front of me, and he was extremely popular in social settings.

One night, Emily and I had planned to go out for dinner, but Joel tagged along. Last minute, something came up, and I had to leave town. Without asking me, Joel messaged Emily and asked if she wanted to go to dinner with him anyway. They texted me from dinner, and honestly, I didn‚Äôt care. By then, I hated Joel, didn‚Äôt trust him, and was praying for the relationship to end so I really didn't care about anything he did. While they were at dinner, they sent me a group message joking about threesomes. I immediately replied, telling Joel not to make Emily uncomfortable, apologised to her, and said I didn‚Äôt know Joel would bring that up. Emily sent back flirty, joking messages saying she‚Äôd be into it if I was. I wasn‚Äôt, so I stopped replying.

Afterward, I was worried about how the situation might affect my friendship with Emily, so I messaged her to apologise again and check if she was okay. We met for coffee soon after and I asked her if she was uncomfortable. She said she wasn‚Äôt‚Äîit was mutual, and she‚Äôd been into it but wasn‚Äôt sure if I would be. I explained that I wasn‚Äôt interested, didn‚Äôt feel comfortable crossing that boundary with a close friend. I also apologized for Joel‚Äôs behavior, saying he shouldn‚Äôt have asked without talking to me first. She reassured me it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and said she‚Äôd have been keen if I was. We laughed it off, and I felt relieved.

Over the following months, Emily occasionally joked about it, but it was always lighthearted. A few months later, I finally ended things with Joel for good.

**Flash Forward to Last Year**

Four years after the breakup, I was thriving. I‚Äôd met my now-fianc√©, my career was taking off, and I‚Äôd lost 20kg of COVID weight. I was healthy, fit, traveling, and finally happy. I‚Äôd moved to a new city for a promotion and started fresh with a housemate to avoid rushing into living with my boyfriend (lesson learned from Joel).

One day, my housemate asked who my ex was. When I told him it was Joel, he said, ‚ÄúUgh, gross. I know him‚Äîhe was really creepy to my friend Sally.‚Äù I apologised and said I wasn‚Äôt surprised, explaining that Joel had been toxic and emotional abusive to me and that I deeply regretted being with him. My housemate treated me differently after that conversation. Although it might have just been that we actually barely saw each other as I practically living at my boyfriends place.

A few months later, I visited Emily in the city and told her about the awkward interaction with my roomy. I explained how ashamed and embarrassed I felt about my relationship with Joel, how it brought back bad memories, and how I hated being associated with him. That‚Äôs when Emily opened up, saying that Joel made her feel uncomfortable that night they went to dinner and that she felt like he wouldn‚Äôt have taken no for an answer if things had escalated.

I told her I was really sorry she felt that way and shared that I experienced the same behavior from Joel regularly. She then told me Joel had shown her naked photos of me as well and it made her uncofortable. She also said that she and Erin had hated Joel from the start, which surpirsed me as they had always gushed about how good-looking, friendly, and successful he was.

Emily also discussed some previous traumatic unwanted sexual experiences from her past. Since then, my friendship with Emily hasn‚Äôt felt the same. It could just be us growing apart.

Erin also cut me off a few months after I broke up with Joel. Although she has done this to other friends and I was never as close to Erin as I was to Emily‚Äîshe‚Äôs very competitive and opinionated, and always treated me as though I was stupid, even though I had always had better grades and a more successful career.

**Feeling really guilty**

I still feel a deep sense of guilt and shame about being with Joel. I regret bringing him into my friends‚Äô lives and exposing them to his behavior. Even though I‚Äôve moved on and am in a much better place now, I sometimes ruminate on this and feel awful about how I let him treat me and how it affected others. I worry it's ruined my relationship with Emily and Erin and feel like I have done something wrong? I guess part of me is hurt to that my friends didn't tell me that my boyfriend was showing naked photos of me with asking. But also I guess I get it because he put her in that awkward situation?

**Six Years Ago (How I Met Joel) - long but context if you want it**

Joel was a walking red flag, but I didn‚Äôt see it at the time. I met him when I was 21 and had never had a serious boyfriend. I was inexperienced in relationships and was immediately infatuated. I‚Äôd moved to a coastal town to live with my sister, who offered me free rent so I could focus on finishing uni via distance while working part-time as a lab assistant. Joel was five years older, extremely charming, and had a high-paying, high-powered career. His confidence and success completely dazzled me.

At first, our connection felt intense and exciting. I found Joel attractive and was drawn to how adventurous and open he was in the bedroom‚Äîit was the first time I‚Äôd felt comfortable exploring things like light choking or spanking. Looking back, I think I was just a 21-year-old craving experiences with someone I found attractive. I'm not even into that stuff anymore and got over it pretty quickly. I mistook infatuation for love, and the power imbalance‚Äîhim being older and much more established‚Äîonly made me idolize him more.

Joel led me on continuously. Whenever I asked for a relationship, he would reject me, insisting he wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious. I accepted it, even though it hurt, and moved on. But as soon as I started dating someone else, Joel popped back into my life, acted jealous and tell me he didn‚Äôt want to lose me, and I‚Äôd fall for it every time.

When he first rejected me, I started dating a guy I‚Äôll call Fred. Fred was kind and wanted to be exclusive after a few weeks of dating, so I told Joel our casual thing was over. Joel acted understanding but surprised and disappointed, saying he‚Äôd made a mistake and wanted to be with me. He even said, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt make the same mistake twice if I had the chance to be your boyfriend again.‚Äù I broke it off with Fred that week and told Joel I was open to giving things another shot‚Äîonly for Joel to gaslight me into thinking I‚Äôd misunderstood him. He denied ever saying he wanted a relationship and made me feel like I was crazy for bringing it up. Joel announced he was moving to the city for work for three months. He suggested we revisit things when he got back, and I, embarrassed and heartbroken, pretended to be fine with it. We spent the day together, and though I didn‚Äôt want to, I let him pressure me into sleeping with him. I felt terrible about myself afterward.

When he came back from the city months later, I hoped for a fresh start but he was even less interested at this point. My life was really not ideal at this point - I was balancing full-time work with full-time studies, my sister was actually charging me rent, and her partner had moved in rent-free and was constantly bullying me. On top of everything, another guy I briefly dated for a few weeks, Liam, was relentlessy stalking me, showing up at my house, and calling me hundreds of times a day for over a year. I was really unhappy, so I decided to leave the coastal town and move back to my hometown to finish uni. Before I left, Joel invited me on a five-day holiday. It was nice but just the same leading me on then dropping me. I moved home the following week.

Over the next year, Joel kept sexting and messaging me daily despite us living hours apart and not seeing each other. It became a chore‚Äîsomething I felt obligated to do for someone who wasn‚Äôt even my boyfriend. Finally, when I finished uni and landed a great graduate job, I told Joel I was done. I said it was strange to keep this up when we weren‚Äôt together and lived so far apart, and I wanted to focus on real relationships.

Joel said he understood but asked if he could visit me one last time to ‚Äúsay goodbye.‚Äù I agreed. When he arrived, we got high (something I rarely do), and he told me how amazing I looked, how stupid he‚Äôd been to overlook me, and how much he wanted to be with me. He even said he now realized ‚Äúit‚Äôs not all about looks,‚Äù which felt like a backhanded compliment since he‚Äôd spent years chasing women he found more attractive.

Stupidly, I let myself believe him. He asked me to be his gf and move to the city with him, and I said no but agreed to try a long-distance relationship first. That‚Äôs when he unloaded all his baggage‚Äîhe told me about a ‚Äúgorgeous‚Äù woman he‚Äôd fallen for in the city who rejected him and cried about an ex who‚Äôd had an abortion (he later claimed it was a different ex).

Despite all this, I still moved to the city a few months later to be with him. He love-bombed me into thinking things would be different, even offering to pay for anything I needed and telling me to quit my job. But the literal moment we packed up the car, his personality flipped.

For example, I asked to borrow a few hundred dollars to pay my car insurance for a few days until my first paycheck (from my new job) came through. He acted uncomfortable and refused, despite having repeatedly offered financial help. I apologized and borrowed from my sister instead, feeling like a burden. His mom was awful to me, belittling me every time we visited her, which was almost every weekend. Joel never stood up for me and said I was ‚Äútoo shy‚Äù to handle her.

I found out he‚Äôd cheated on me with his ex‚Äîthe one he swore was ‚Äújust a close friend.‚Äù He went out of his way to tell me he was seeing her, made me out to be be insecure and jealous all the while actually cheating on me with her. I found the messages on his phone when I saw innapproriate messages flashing up on his computer while he sexted her at work. He admitted it, denied it, then admitted it again when I confronted him with proof. He constantly criticized me, calling me fat when I weighed 52kg instead of 49kg and telling me I‚Äôd be a terrible mother because I was ‚Äútoo shy.‚Äù

He pushed his bimbo kink on me constantly, despite me repeatedly saying no/ im not into anymore. He wanted me to get lip fillers, E-cup breast implants, eat less than 500 calories a day, and let him sleep with other women. He pressured me to be in an open relationship while refusing to let me see anyone else. Whenever I set boundaries, he‚Äôd accuse me of shutting down the conversation or misleading him into thinking I was okay with his demands. I tried breaking up with him multiple times, but he‚Äôd cry, promise to change, and then go back to the same behavior.

After a year, I finally had enough. I called my parents, asked them to drive 14 hours to get me, packed my things, and left.

**TD;LR**  
Years ago, I moved cities for a toxic relationship, ignoring red flags. My ex bf was creepy towards my friend and made her uncomfortable and crossed boundaries, which I didn‚Äôt fully realize at the time. Though I‚Äôve moved on and rebuilt my life, I feel deep guilt for exposing my friends to his behavior and worry it damaged our relationships. Im still struggling with shame over how it all unfolded and wish I could forget about it all.

He acted uncomfortable and refused, despite having repeatedly offered financial help. I apologized and borrowed from my sister instead, feeling like a burden. His mom was awful to me, belittling me every time we visited her, which was almost every weekend. Joel never stood up for me and said I was ‚Äútoo shy‚Äù to handle her.

I found out he‚Äôd cheated on me with his ex‚Äîthe one he swore was ‚Äújust a close friend.‚Äù He went out of his way to tell me he was seeing her, made me out to be be insecure and jealous all the while actually cheating on me with her. I found the messages on his phone when I saw innapproriate messages flashing up on his computer while he sexted her at work. He admitted it, denied it, then admitted it again when I confronted him with proof. He constantly criticized me, calling me fat when I weighed 52kg instead of 49kg and telling me I‚Äôd be a terrible mother because I was ‚Äútoo shy.‚Äù

He pushed his bimbo kink on me constantly, despite me repeatedly saying no/ im not into anymore. He wanted me to get lip fillers, E-cup breast implants, eat less than 500 calories a day, and let him sleep with other women. He pressured me to be in an open relationship while refusing to let me see anyone else. Whenever I set boundaries, he‚Äôd accuse me of shutting down the conversation or misleading him into thinking I was okay with his demands. I tried breaking up with him multiple times, but he‚Äôd cry, promise to change, and then go back to the same behavior.

After a year, I finally had enough. I called my parents, asked them to drive 14 hours to get me, packed my things, and left.

**TD;LR**  
Years ago, I moved cities for a toxic relationship, ignoring red flags. My ex bf was creepy towards my friend and made her uncomfortable and crossed boundaries, which I didn‚Äôt fully realize at the time. Though I‚Äôve moved on and rebuilt my life, I feel deep guilt for exposing my friends to his behavior and worry it damaged our relationships.

39 year old man here that has been separated for the past 2 years.  In looking on reddit and dating apps, everyone seems to love horror, anime and crocheting?

About me:  I have two kids and they both play 3 sports.  I am constantly busy bringing them to their games/practices so I'm not sure what free time is anymore, much less what I like to do when I have it.  I know that I don't like horror movies, never have really gotten into anime, and I am overweight and would love to work on that but would be much easier with a friend to help.  Also, because I am a dad, I have acquired the prerequisite list of dad jokes from orientation and will be more than happy to share them with you if you need a quick laugh.

I do like board/card/video games, although I don't seem to have much time to play them anymore.  I enjoy trying new coffee shops and listening to live music, snuggling under a blanket and watching a movie, pickleball and really any sports in general, and other interest that can't be discussed here, but I am an open book and will happily answer any questions in chat.

It's a tradition started by the Salvation Army where they hang up requests from less fortunate children on a tree in businesses, workplaces, and gathering places like churches; and good Samaritans can take a child's name and Christmas list and fill it for them and turn it in to be donated to the family. 

Only unwrapped presents are accepted so the parents can even wrap the presents themselves and put them under the tree as they see fit, or give Santa the credit if they want. 

For the past couple years my girlfriend and I have chosen to take a kid off the tree at our favorite coffee shop and fill the list for them. We usually end up spending around $120-$150 in clothing and toys. Last year we got a girl who wanted a bike or scooter and needed some warm winter clothes. We managed to get the scooter and nice coat and warm clothes for our budget as well as some toys. 

This year when looking at the tree we started a little late so a lot of the kids had already been taken. I noticed a theme with the remaining kids however that gave me pause. Mostly Teens, and mostly asking for something quite large and pricey as their Christmas gift. Whether it was a new iPhone or a Nintendo Switch. One even requested a new bed and mattress. 

While we want to help out and spread a little holiday cheer, it's not really in our budget to drop $350 on a video game console as well as the needed new shoes or winter coat for donation especially at the holidays.. But I feel awful seeing all these requests being left behind on the tree. I don't wanna take one and then not fill their wish if someone else might but I also don't wanna think of them going without gifts just because someone asked what their biggest wish was and they were honest. 

Any advice to assuage my guilt or give me guidance for next year? We already filled two Christmas lists this year and even went a little over budget to make sure they were great.

During weekends, I usually wake up ng super early like 5 or 6 AM.We are 4 in the house but ako lang lagi nauuna nagigising samin. It's always my body clock to wake up ng maaga during weekends.  nag work out muna ako until 6 then took my coffee after.At 6:24AM lumabas ako kasi It's kindda cool sa labas kasi pag madaling araw super cold yung feeling ng air at mas nafifeel ko yung coffee ko.

My previous post people just wanted to focus on stuff that had nothing to do with the question at hand mostly grammar corrections. 
   Anyway my mom hired a cleaning crew to clean my apartment without telling me. She invited me out for the day. We went out to the country with my daughter got some fresh eggs and milk, saw the animals and went for lunch with my aunt who lives around there. I live right outside the city which I hate sometimes. I live in an apartment which I don't love so it's nice to get out of the hustle and  bustle of the urban like area and enjoy a break in the calm country. 
    Anyway it was a nice day out. I spent more money than I normally spend buying fresh eggs and milk but it was well worth it. My mom treated us to lunch. For some reason my Dad decided to stay behind and he stayed in my apartment. I just figured he wasn't feeling well he's 80 years old and has diabetes. Anyway I get home and they acted weird. First my dad sent nhmmom to the Dollar tree with us. My mom wouldn't explain why but went off on her own once we arrived to get stuff. I bought a couple of things I needed then my dad wanted to take us to dinner which was nice but usually my parents don't go out for lunch and dinner. I thought that was a little alarming but I let it slide because I appreciate it.       
     Then my dad told me he cleaned my apartment which concerned me because of his health issues and told me it's best that I sleep over my mom's and that he slept there which I thought was weird but I went along with it.
      The next day he got weird and told me that he had to throw out some expired food. Now obviously if food is bad that makes sense I kind of prefer to use my own judgment on that. But initially thought no big deal. He might have thrown out a couple of goldfish containers that were a bit past the date that we're probably fine but no biggie. He tells me he would replace any food that he tossed but that's annoying when people say that because he knows very well I would never ask him to do that and it puts me in uncomfortable position. But initially I thought no big deal. I didn't think I had really many foods that were expired. 
    It was more than just food that was thrown away or at the very least moved. I realize the place looked too clean to have been cleaned by my dad. I finally got it out of my parents that they hired someone to clean. My television is Now not working I don't know why or what they did with it. My dad said they moved it to sweep under it but they could have just swept around it they could have just put the broom a little under it I would not have agreed for them to move the TV but even if they did I don't see how that could have broken it but it's completely not working.   
      They tossed all my Thanksgiving leftovers from the fridge all of my Parmesan reggiano which is good cheese that I get from Costco's and some other cheeses that were not even opened. Strangely they kept the foods that I didn't even care about that probably were expired and I highly doubt that they were even looking at the dates anyway. When my mom and I go shopping at Target my mom sometimes goes on shopping sprees and buys a bunch of stuff she doesn't want and then pushes them on other people so I had like some packs of sargenta cheese and crackers packs Which might not even be good anymore I just forgot about it not even that I didn't want to eat it. I probably would have eaten it cuz I eat cheese and crackers but I just forgot it existed because I didn't buy it. I probably didn't need it at the time because I always have a brick of cheese. I just probably didn't even think of it. But that's still there yet the good expensive cheeses I had and unopened perfectly good thing of bacon is not there anymore neither is the leftover turkey that I could have Frozen and made into pot pies and turkey soup like I do every year and look forward to.
   They moved my daughter's light bright to a box but the pegs/ bulbs that were on the coffee table. I got mad at my mom and told her to buy new pegs.  I don't usually do that. I don't usually yell at my mom butI just got so frustrated because earlier today when I tried to talk civil she got defensive and dismissive and yelled at me. I got mad at my mom because I couldn't find fresh new coffee beans that I got as a gift that were expensive but then I found them in another completely different cabinet way high up but that shouldn't have been the case I shouldn't have to play guessing game. 
   If my mom would have told me ahead of time I would have just locked the cabinets with the child safety locks or just tape them if I can't find the child safety locks put a note on that said don't open locked the fridge or just put tape and a note and put away anything that was out maybe stored it away they also went through my closet which I also would have locked. 
   To me I have a big pet peeve about going through my cabinets and closets. I told my mom ahead of time when she mentiomed the cleaning crew that I would have had no problem with cleaning crew coming. What I had a problem was was that she was weird and sneaky about it so I had no chance to get prepared for it then my dad calls and complains that I had clothes in the flow well maybe I wouldn't have if you would have told me it's like almost like they wanted to call me out on something so they could get away with ransacking my home as a matter of speaking.",2,1733117949.0,family,4,1.0,False

I am in search of my next career role in Cloud Architect or SRE Architect in Kochi or Trivandrum. I am ok to step down a lesser role than Architect if the pay is decent and help me to catch up again. I am not looking for People Manager role at this moment, but if I have to build a team from scratch, I am ready to take up this challenge.

I came from Infrastructure background, hence most of my interviews goes in vain after four or five rounds in Big4 or pay masters.

I worked for Cafe Coffee Day, Myntra, Dailyhunt, Lazada (Alibaba Group, China), Cult from Curefit. At this moment I am into freelancing, I lived in Chennai, Bangalore, Singapore and Dubai _(for short time)_ before.

**Why Infrastructure SRE background is crucial in SRE or Platform Engineering?**

Sure, here‚Äôs a more human and balanced version that emphasizes the added value of an Infrastructure SRE background compared to Application SRE skills:

When it comes to the role of an SRE Architect, the distinction between Infrastructure SRE and Application SRE is crucial. Someone with an Infrastructure SRE background, especially with experience in building private clouds from scratch, brings a unique and valuable perspective. They‚Äôve likely dealt with systems at a kernel and hardware level, gaining a deep understanding of how the underlying infrastructure operates, scales, and recovers.

On the other hand, Application SREs often work at the software layer, focusing on service-level objectives, CI/CD pipelines, and application reliability. While these skills are essential, they typically don‚Äôt cover the complexities of hardware-level optimizations, storage, compute, or network configurations that are foundational to reliable systems.

An Infrastructure SRE background complements Application SRE expertise by bridging this gap. It enables architects to design systems that are both robust and scalable, ensuring the infrastructure can support the demands of modern applications. For example, an Infrastructure SRE knows how to fine-tune kernel parameters, optimize resource allocation, and design disaster recovery strategies‚Äîskills that go beyond the scope of most application-focused roles.

In short, a well-rounded SRE Architect needs to bring both perspectives to the table. Infrastructure SRE experience isn‚Äôt just an added value‚Äîit‚Äôs often the missing piece that ensures systems are designed with reliability in mind from the ground up, not just at the application level.

What‚Äôs your take? Can Application SRE skills alone deliver the depth needed for resilient system design, or does the blend of Infrastructure SRE expertise make all the difference?

After my constant bending over to use a dustpan started causing back pain (getting old, I guess), I decided to try these automatic vacuum dustpans. Been using both EyeVac models for the past few months, and honestly, they've transformed my daily cleaning routine.

**EyeVac Pet Touchless Stationary Vacuum (1400W)** This premium model has become the MVP of my kitchen cleaning arsenal. The 1400-watt motor really shows its strength when dealing with everything from fine dust to scattered cereal to stubborn pet hair. What's impressed me most is how it handles different types of debris - from quick kitchen cleanups after dinner to dealing with tracked cat litter near the box (game changer!). The infrared sensors are super reliable, and the large capacity canister means less frequent emptying - I usually go about a week of daily use before the indicator light comes on.

[how it looks :\)](https://preview.redd.it/yd1dbqzxed4e1.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=e19d86667b0de3e7c6e0be8133652c3e67fe826c)

My neighbor Julie, who has three golden retrievers, borrowed mine for a weekend and immediately ordered one - she mentioned it's significantly more powerful than her old central vac dustpan attachment. The sealed HEPA filtration system really makes a difference too - I've noticed less dust settling on surfaces nearby.

Pros:

* Exceptional suction power for all debris types
* High-capacity bagless canister
* Dual HEPA filtration system
* Reliable motion sensors
* Great for pet hair and litter
* Sturdy construction
* Status indicator for full bin

Minor considerations:

* Takes up slightly more floor space
* Premium price point ($199)
* Needs to be near an outlet

**EyeVac Home Touchless Vacuum (1000W)** The standard model is no slouch either. With its 1000-watt motor, it handles everyday messes effectively. I have this one in my mudroom for quick cleanups of tracked-in dirt and debris. It's more compact and lighter than the Pet model, making it perfect for smaller spaces or areas with lighter cleaning needs.

Pros:

* More compact footprint
* Effective for daily debris
* Same reliable sensor technology
* More budget-friendly
* Lightweight design
* Easy maintenance
* Perfect for apartments

Minor considerations:

* Smaller debris container
* Slightly less powerful suction
* May need multiple passes for heavy debris

Both models are incredibly convenient for daily maintenance cleaning - just sweep or brush debris toward them, and their automatic sensors kick in. They're especially helpful for quick kitchen cleanups, pet areas, mudrooms, bathrooms, and anywhere you'd normally use a dustpan. The touchless operation is fantastic when your hands are full or dirty.

For anyone wondering about real-world use: I literally just sweep everything toward it - cookie crumbs, spilled coffee grounds, tracked-in dirt, pet hair, cat litter, kid's craft mess (glitter is no match!), and even small food bits. The bagless design makes emptying simple, and the washable filters help keep maintenance costs down.

If budget allows, I'd definitely recommend the Pet model - the extra power and capacity make it worth the investment, especially if you have pets or kids. But honestly, either unit is miles better than traditional dustpans or constantly pulling out the full vacuum for small messes. They're particularly great for those with back issues, mobility concerns, or anyone who just wants to make daily cleaning more efficient.",4,1733117111.0,MyConsumerReviews,0,1.0,False
1h4nql1,https://i.redd.it/roqmxjlwed4e1.jpeg,"Some might say, ""They aged!"" but here are four imposter replacements that took place within the same movies","Top left is Al Pacino and his imposter replacement in the movie Serpico (1973). I always place the true original on the left and the imposter on the right because that's the way we read and usually how we order one thing after another. In the case of Al Pacino the screenshot of him is taken from later in the movie and the screenshot of the imposter is from one of the earliest scenes.

What they did was get Pacino to grow a full beard before shooting began and they filmed Serpico's scenes in reverse order. As the shoot progressed they would cut his beard until he was clean shaven. When they edited the film they placed the scenes in chronological order, so that as time progresses throughout the movie his beard appears to grow. What they also did was kill Al Pacino and film the earlier scenes with a clean shaven imposter. The beard is also used to disguise the switch. Serpico was filmed between Godfathers I and II, so you've got different actors playing Michael Corleone in those.

Top right is Robert de Niro and his imposter replacement in the movie Taxi Driver (1976). Last year (2023) I said to myself, ""I need to take my mind off this, watch a movie that's got nothing to do with imposter replacements or something."" I've had the dvd for the movie Taxi Driver since around 2006 and I've watched it only about half a dozen times. I put it in my Xbox 360 and sat down to watch it.

Pure escapism from the real world and my investigation, I was watching the film attentively. Then when he slides up to the secret service agent at the political rally at the corner of Central Park and de Niro's face comes on screen I gasped and took a deep intake of breath. ""NO!!"" It was a different guy to the one I'd been watching in the first half of the movie. 

I have experience the same instant recognition before but this was no less shocking. I was reaching out to the screen panting, ""No no wuh? Uh?"" Then the secret service agent said to him, ""What's your name?"" and the Robert de Niro imposter goes, ""Henry Krinkle."" I cried out, ""Aargh! Shit!"" I'd watched the dvd multiple times and I'd watched the film multiple times on television going back to the 80s - never had it occurred to me that it was a different person, and I'm not talking about Henry Krinkle being a different person to Travis Bickle.

That name change in that scene is how they worked magic upon me, cast a spell, in all the previous times I watched the movie. By forcing the viewer to say, ""You're not Henry Krinkle,"" They are forcing the viewer to say, ""You are Robert de Niro"" in kind. What further reinforces the viewer's acceptance of the imposter is that the character of Travis Bickle undergoes a ""descent into madness"" as a narrative hook. I carried on watching the rest of the movie and I think there's a small scene after the one at Central Park back at the apartment that features the true original. Either that scene or the very last scene in the cab with Sybill Shepard is the last time we see the true original.

What was supposed to be a break turned into another investigation. I looked through de Niro's filmography and at screenshots before and after Taxi Driver and the movie after ""1900"" only has the imposter in it. I went to bed and the next day I took my cat for a walk on a disused plot of land near me. There was a pear tree at the edge of a garden with branches hanging over, so I picked a couple and ate one.

I got home and I had to watch The Godfather Part II and 1900. I hadn't seen The Godfather Part II and there's a long single take scene where de Niro  is walking home and when he gets home he gives his wife something. She opens the wrapper and says, ""That's a nice pear."" I looked down at the coffee table and the pear that I'd saved was there. I felt a presence. A few days later I had a dream and young true Robert de Niro is in it. He recognises me and is delighted to see me. I said to him , ""I'm sorry man. I don't know what I'm doing or what I have to do."" He said, ""Don't worry about it. You're doing great.""

Bottom left is John Travolta and his imposter replacement in Urban Cowboy (1980). I don't like this one because it was just too easy to find. I wanted to use Grace Kelly because it took me five years to find out she was replaced during the production of Dial M for Murder (1954) but she looked out of place amongst the male leads of modern cinema. I went with Travolta instead. 

They've used the same methodology as when they replaced Al Pacino only this time the replacement occurs chronologically. He cuts his own beard off and the next scene - in a bar - is the imposter's reveal. I investigated him because I'd found out Olivia Newton John had been replaced around that time. The two imposter replacements of the Grease stars also starred in a movie together in 1983 called ""Two of a Kind."" I actually went to see that at the cinema with a couple of schoolmates at the time because we were bored. I remember us coming out and saying, ""It wasn't that bad."" Fooled again!

Bottom right is Val Kilmer in the movie Heat (1995). I've seen it a few times but this time I was watching it because of the act off between who I now know to be imposter replacements of Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. It still came out of the blue when I saw Val Kilmer had been replaced. No prizes for guessing where it takes place. It's when he pulls up to Ashley Judd's apartment and she waves him off. The imposter doesn't do any scenes with any of the stars, but I think the fake de Niro and Pacino have set him up.

So there you have it. They replace actors during the production of movies and perform dark arts on the silver screen. I know because they've done it to me several times. They know how the human brain work and they have ways of getting our brains to do all the heavy lifting. Our minds and our personalities are none the wiser - we are spellbound.

1h4nn05,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4nn05,Corsican Death-Salamander,"On very rare occasions, nature-lovers are able to quietly watch, as the female  ‚ÄúCorsican Death-Salamander‚Äù trudges to shore and serves tea and biscuits. As in all mating rituals, there is no guarantee that a gentleman Death-Salamander will be there waiting. If he has he will hopefully have prepared for the occasion, having used his beak and whatever else they have at hand, to make the little chairs and coffee-table required.

Once she arrives and the tea-cup is set on the table, the male drops in a sugar cube and a good dollop of cream. They exchange pleasantries and the female quickly tidies up, shoves the cup up her skirt and curtsies, before trudging back into the sea. 

Four years later her tail opens up and a baby Death-Salamander pops out of the top and swims away. The mother then faces the sky, gives a bloodcurdling scream and explodes - providing of floating black glob of sustenance, for the baby to feed on for many years.

The national language of Corsica is French. It is known as le petit pays de la cr√®me - ‚Äúthe little land of cream.‚Äù And with good reason. It is riddled with deep tunnels made of petrified sugar - within which flows some of the most disgusting cream in the world.

The Corsicans mine this cream and export it to gourmet-stores and specialty coffee-shops, where discriminating customers drink it by the gallon and pretend to like it. 

Cream mining is a dangerous process and the miners are very careful not to disturb the male Death-Salamanders, who live in the tunnels and use the sugar and cream in their tea ceremonies.

The evolutionary history of the ceremony is a tragic one.

Millions of years ago, the ancestors of the Death-Salamander were a highly-advanced and genteel, tea-drinking race. Indeed, the religious rite of ‚ÄúHigh Tea‚Äù was the foundation stone upon which their civilisation was built. No milk though, as cows hadn‚Äôt been invented yet. So they were all lactose intolerant. 

When the first cream started to ooze out of the earth and into the tunnels, where they lived, they made the fatal error of putting it in their tea. They soon became addicted to the stuff - despite the god-awful stomach aches. Day and night they would drink ever-increase amounts of the cream and it wasn‚Äôt long before they began swimming in it. 

All intellectual pursuit stopped. Their brains withered and they quickly devolved into carnivorous beasts of the sea - ruled by instinct and nothing more. The tea ceremony is all that remains.

Nevertheless, the life-cycle of the Death-Salamander is all rather beautiful and little-known outside Corsica - mainly because David Attenborough has never been there to tell people about it. This was a conscious decision, based upon some minimal research the BBC did about Corsican government‚Äôs Death-Salamander feeding program.

Those daring adventurers who do go to Corsica, rarely return. This is not-so-much because it is so enchanting and beautiful (which it is) - but more because they couldn‚Äôt be bothered learning French. See post card number 2.

So, if you receive a postcard from Corsica and are considering going there, remember - Corsicans are not very good at English. So make sure you translate the captions first‚Ä¶ ",3,1733116718.0,Absurdism,6,1.0,False

I got out to pump for her, and she hands me her credit card (I didn‚Äôt know it was expired) I tried 3 times to use it and just ended up paying for it myself. She never even acknowledged it. I‚Äôve also given her son his allowance because she couldn‚Äôt be bothered to do it.

When she told me that I was paying half of them, I asked her if I could see the bills so I knew what I was paying. Apparently this was completely unacceptable, as they are private and personal documents that aren‚Äôt any business of mine. She told me she would ‚Äúdo some calculations‚Äù to determine how much I owed her in rent. 

So last night in bed, for one month of rent in subsidized housing, was $3000 dollars. She then told me that I‚Äôm supposed to be paying for everything, and that it was a privilege to be living there with them. (I have a comfortable place of my own.) She said to me today, that it‚Äôs the first of the month and I need to decide if I‚Äôm going to pay or not. I told her I was still thinking, and she immediately told me to leave. So I did.

I ordered my beans the same day that the video about the Decaf Project dropped, and, like many folks here, I am very excited. I have never done a tasting before and did not participate in the previous video - The World's Largest Coffee Tasting. I got into coffee later after I visited Hanoi and Melbourne, then through James's videos.

I want to keep as many of the variables the same as possible for the tasting on December 15th. I went ahead and ordered cupping bowls for this (please don't do this if you don't have the money - I just moved and needed small bowls anyway. Plus I found it fun!) The grinder I plan to use is a Kingrinder P1 which should be good enough. I also have a Rok hand grinder that I could use. Anyways, I'm curious about grind size. I've looked at the [FAQs of the Decaf Project](https://www.thedecafproject.com/faq) and followed up on [how to set up for a coffee tasting](https://www.worldslargestcoffeetasting.com/resources). I didn't get a whole lot of information on [grind size besides ""finer end of medium fine.""](https://youtu.be/cSEgP4VNynQ?t=344) Any further information would be helpful.

[Another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1h26j7i/resting_and_grinding_decaf_project_kit/) had questions on grind size and resting. I'm also wondering if I should rest the decaf for 2 weeks. My order shipped yesterday. I might rest the beans for a week then freeze them. What are your thoughts?

James Hoffmann not only got me into coffee, but now I'm getting into water! I knew I would go down this rabbit hole eventually, however, the Decaf Project gave me the activation energy to get started. How can I best normalize water so the coffee I'm tasting tastes as close to the coffee James will make during the live stream?

I have looked into the [Barista Hustle's recipes](https://www.baristahustle.com/diy-water-recipes-redux/), and I am excited to learn more. I have looked up the TDS and other properties of my water by my zip code (I have pretty soft water at 131 ppm on average at the water treatment plant), filtered with a Britta (I know it doesn't do much - I plan to pick up DI or distilled water tomorrow. If it's worth it to me after that, I will get my own system like ZeroWater), and made my first batch of water.

Are there other variables that I may have missed?

James, if you happen to see this, you opened my eyes to what coffee can be, so I will always be grateful. However, I would never have spent time, money, or energy on this hobby if it wasn't for your videos, so there's that too!",1,1733116064.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

We started at a coffee shop, sat and talked for about an hour . Everything was going great so I asked if she wanted to go on a walk through the neighborhood. Again, super great, good convo and I kept subtly touching her arm along with my best attempt at flirting (very introverted). 

She then asked if I wanted to go to a dinner spot nearby! A noodle place and I happily accepted. 

Here‚Äôs the catch. She told me she was allergic to peanuts but not like crazy allergic. We were eating at a place that often includes peanuts in the dishes. So cross-contamination didn‚Äôt seem like a huge issue. When she ordered she asked the waiter for no peanuts but not just for her but for both of us. We did make eye contact after she said that. But I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. We ate and I walked her to her car. Chitchated, exchanged numbers and hugged goodbye. 

So here‚Äôs my question‚Ä¶ did I miss the signal for a goodnight kiss??? I was honestly so nervous and definitely don‚Äôt have any rizz üòÖthat I‚Äôve blanked out that whole last interaction.

Posting this on my alt because idek what to do anymore im so overwhelmed and just need opinions/advice/help. I think im bi/pansexual and im ok just need a lot of help and someone to talk it through with. A quick summary of my story can be summed bellow

When I was just graduating high school I was your stereotypical jock straight man. I loved sports and just was overall a very masculine man. Over the next year 18-19 looking back there was some small changes but nothing major to pick up on but I started noticing small things like I started to become a bit more timid and to myself and became less of a let‚Äôs hookup and fuck guy and more of let‚Äôs cuddle soft boy who‚Äôd still do the same things just very different personality. Once I turned 19 this is when I started noticing big changes and felt myself becoming more feminine/bi. I had began hating seeing hair on my body/face and pretty much started shaving myself all the time. I started to distance myself from homophobic friends. I began to notice difference in the porn I watched and experimented with trans/femboy stuff and liked it(also still watched straight stuff lol). Then in public I saw me catch myself looking at asses and they weren‚Äôt girls and they were guys and didn‚Äôt feel like I was wrong and slowly thought oh wtv an ass is an ass. Eventually started realizing about 7 months ago that maybe I wasn‚Äôt straight and it wasn‚Äôt some fetish but I didn‚Äôt really have anyone to come out to. At this point in time I was completely in denial and just kept telling myself it was a faze and I was straight. The last 7 months are the real rollercoaster. I‚Äôve still gotten with females but have been more interested in feminine men then ever before. I cut off anyone in my life that‚Äôs homophobic(pretty much every male friend I had) and just tried to be my true self. I tried to accept myself but felt like I was still living a double life until 2 weeks ago this all changed. One of my platonic female friends had some of her friends over 10-15 of us a few guys mostly girls to just chill and watch tv. One of them is a flirt gay (this is important). Night was fine but eventually the girls asked some of the guys to get them coffee and me and him went because I was just trying to be nice and so was he. We got in his car and he pecked my check and I started blushing and he turns to me and says trust me I know you and started laughing. I felt really embarrassed and then he convinced me to hook up with him and I‚Äôm ngl it felt completely normal and I loved it. I asked him to please keep this between us and he agreed and said dw I like the fun of it being my little secret. Ever since then I‚Äôve been thinking I‚Äôm bi but I‚Äôm attracted to femine oriented people and have started to become feminine oriented myself as more habits,behaviours lead towards traditional feminine activity. I don‚Äôt live in an open accepting household and if I came out I‚Äôd get shamed.  I just need people to talk me through this because I‚Äôm really been stressing out over this and is coming my life. Is it so wrong I just want to live a life I‚Äôm scared to win. I just want people to like me for who I am, not who I feel obligated to pretend to be.

If anyone has any comments or just can offer to talk to me it‚Äôd be huge and I‚Äôd love it. More than anything I have lots of weight on me and just want to release it and be myself to someone at least!",2,1733115661.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False
1h4nbiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1h4nbiy/i_bit_my_coworker/,I bit my coworker,"**I bit my coworker** 

**Originally posted to Ask A Manager** 

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Hostile workplace!< 

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/07/i-bit-my-coworker.html)¬† **July 12, 2017** 

So I bit a coworker yesterday. Obviously, I‚Äôm mortified. 

I work in an incredibly dysfunctional office. The tone is set by our office manager. He‚Äôs in his fifties, has always worked in an office setting, and is difficult. Things are right if it‚Äôs in his favor and wrong if anyone else does it. He once cursed at me and called me a child for asking him not to say I‚Äôm prettier if I smile. He then didn‚Äôt speak to me for a year ‚Äî which was a relief.
Well, yesterday, I had a meeting with a coworker. (If it makes a difference, the office manager and I are on the same level, as is the person I was meeting with.) My hands were full of paperwork and a full mug. When I got to the coworker‚Äôs office, the office manager was in the doorway, braced with one arm stretched across the opening. I stopped, said, ‚ÄúExcuse me, I have a meeting.‚Äù Aaaaaand he refused to move. He replied that he didn‚Äôt give a s*** and it wasn‚Äôt his problem. The coworker grimaced but said nothing, as is usual for our office. 

Normally, I‚Äôd sit and argue. Rarely, I‚Äôm able to convince him to move. In those cases, I‚Äôd put down my things in the office and wait for the colleague¬†and him to finish speaking. They don‚Äôt work together or like each other, but they angry-gossip frequently. 

This time ‚Äî this time I bit him. I don‚Äôt know! His arm was in front of my face, my hands were full, I know from experience he almost never moves, and I‚Äôm reaaaaally busy right now. 

In any case, I bit him, over his sleeve, pulled back, and we just sort of stared at each other for a second, because ‚Ä¶ wow. He finally got his feet under him, figuratively, and retaliated by stomping on my feet (I was in ballet flats and he had heeled dress shoes) and shoving me. As I‚Äôm regaining my balance and trying to save my feet, I dropped my mug, which shattered. At that point, he stopped and bent to pick up the shards. I ducked into the office and shut and locked the door. Not helping him pick up the shards angered him more. 

I‚Äôve since apologized. He accepted gracefully, while admitting no fault on his part. 

This office is bad. It‚Äôs warping my perceptions of normal behavior. I know there is no one above us who would address this issue with him and short of quitting, I have to deal with him every day. What is the right way to deal with difficult coworkers in these situations? Just keep arguing? Walk away and reschedule the meeting? There are no magic words to deal with impossible people, but how do I reason with myself mentally to stop myself from going down this road again? 

Thank you for considering my question. I suppose most everything is solved by ‚Äúwalking away,‚Äù but I feel helpless and clearly spiral a bit into wild behavior when at a loss‚Ä¶ 

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/12/update-i-bit-my-coworker.html)¬† **Dec 11, 2017 (5 months later)** 

So I don‚Äôt have an update I think anyone will like. Going through Alison‚Äôs three suggestions: 

#1) Find a new job. I applied to the perfect position the next day, interviewed within the week, aaaaand bombed the interview. Nerves? Lack of practice? I do have Alison‚Äôs book, did research, but just didn‚Äôt click with anyone. Probably going to stay where I am. I like almost every aspect of my job except for my office manager, and not everyone can say that. 

#2) Apologize to witness coworkers. Turns out, as I‚Äôd thought, no one in the office cared that I bit the office manager. I spoke to one person in the office that I find professional and whose opinion I respect. He was confused that I was upset, felt that biting someone wasn‚Äôt that crazy for our office, and in the end he didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal. Actually, the office manager was shoving me a bit the other day and one coworker chimed in, ‚ÄúHey, careful, you know what happens when you do that,‚Äù referring to when I‚Äôd dropped and broken my mug. Everyone was completely confused, had to be reminded, and then lost interest. 

#3) Learn to let it go. I roll my eyes now. I shrug it off. I don‚Äôt stress myself out. I miss a meeting? Oh well. 

Addressing commenter suggestions: 

I really took a step back and examined my high stress levels. It was clear I was having some anxiety issues. I called my doctor looking to talk it out and maybe get meds for the short-term. When I explained I bit someone, I could hear her metal stutter. She thought she‚Äôd misheard me. In the end though, it was decided I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù enough to make office time for. I was referred to a different doctor about an hour and a half trip from my home, which didn‚Äôt help my anxiety or make sense for my schedule. Basically I just had a reaaally horrible few months, but made it out the other side and feel fine now. 

Biting a coworker is obviously crazy behavior and never ok. I certainly haven‚Äôt done it again and don‚Äôt plan to. But in the long run, my office manager is a raging jerk. I‚Äôd like to see how others handle someone, sitting 5 feet away for 50ish hours a week, who constantly calls them a b*tch, tells them they‚Äôre fat, says their mother doesn‚Äôt love them, criticizes clothes and makeup, polices how much they eat, and basically makes everything as difficult as possible. Please, show me you can do better. In the end I feel bad ‚Ä¶ but not that bad. 

The office manager doesn‚Äôt even care. He‚Äôs not angrily holding on to the fact that I bit him. We get coffee. We go on walks. He confides in me and asks for advice regarding work situations. He‚Äôs an ass, and I guess maybe I am too? But at least I‚Äôm an ass with better coping strategies going forward, because now I shrug it off and put on headphones when it gets to be too much. 

I deeply thank everyone for their suggestions. Knowing that I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs broken and lashed out really helped when I was going through that rough patch. 

In the long run, yeah, maybe this is warping my perception of normal. But everyone I talk to with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù office job seems to hate it. They go in, stare at four walls for eight hours, barely talk to anyone, and then go home to complain about how much their work sucks. Do I wish my office manager would quit? Of course. But I‚Äôm not crying myself to sleep over his behavior. I put up with it and the trade off is an active, interesting office culture where we get drinks, have fun, tell jokes, the pay is good, the benefits amazing, and the work interesting. 

Thank you for your thoughts, sympathies, and personal stories. I promise to keep my teeth to myself in the future.

About two years ago I moved to my current house and quickly began to notice a cat around the neighborhood; I‚Äôd come home from bars and sit on my porch with him for a few minutes before heading to bed, and it was a fun little routine. At the time I had gone through mutual but painful breakup that ended with the two cats staying with my partner (a decision I still believe was the correct one), so meeting this cat right at the beginning of this new chapter of my life felt serendipitous. 

Well, it didn‚Äôt take long before things had progressed. I learned his name was Rusty from my neighbor, that his owners were a few houses down, and from there I had become this cat‚Äôs second father. 

Rusty would come over every morning and I‚Äôd let him and drink my coffee with him before clocking in for work; at 5pm Rusty would promptly walk to the front door for me to let him out so he could head home, get dinner, and then head back over. This progressed to the point where Rusty would sleep with me if he stayed over late enough.

On November 19th I learned from my neighbor that Rusty had been hit by a car and put down. I always feared this would happen with his owners letting him be an outdoor cat, as I myself would never do that due to the anxiety it would cause me. Part of me blames myself for his death because at any point I could‚Äôve spoken to his owners about it but it felt inappropriate to tell someone what to do with their seemingly happy pet. 

I don‚Äôt know how to proceed from here. Rusty wasn‚Äôt even my pet but he healed my heart when I thought I would never love anyone again, and now that he‚Äôs gone the void he‚Äôs left feels like it‚Äôs devouring me. I can‚Äôt function normally on a daily basis since he died. Beyond the immediate grief for my furry friend it‚Äôs stirred up a myriad of other things I was already depressed about, and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to navigate through all of this without him. 

I feel broken. I‚Äôm shutting down more as the days pass and the intrusive thoughts just get more deafening. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll be the same person as I was even if I do manage to grieve and heal from this, and that terrifies me. ",3,1733115582.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False

Posting this on my alt because idek what to do anymore im so overwhelmed and just need opinions/advice/help. I think im bi/pansexual and im ok just need a lot of help and someone to talk it through with. A quick summary of my story can be summed bellow

When I was just graduating high school I was your stereotypical jock straight man. I loved sports and just was overall a very masculine man. Over the next year 18-19 looking back there was some small changes but nothing major to pick up on but I started noticing small things like I started to become a bit more timid and to myself and became less of a let‚Äôs hookup and fuck guy and more of let‚Äôs cuddle soft boy who‚Äôd still do the same things just very different personality. Once I turned 19 this is when I started noticing big changes and felt myself becoming more feminine/bi. I had began hating seeing hair on my body/face and pretty much started shaving myself all the time. I started to distance myself from homophobic friends. I began to notice difference in the porn I watched and experimented with trans/femboy stuff and liked it(also still watched straight stuff lol). Then in public I saw me catch myself looking at asses and they weren‚Äôt girls and they were guys and didn‚Äôt feel like I was wrong and slowly thought oh wtv an ass is an ass. Eventually started realizing about 7 months ago that maybe I wasn‚Äôt straight and it wasn‚Äôt some fetish but I didn‚Äôt really have anyone to come out to. At this point in time I was completely in denial and just kept telling myself it was a faze and I was straight. The last 7 months are the real rollercoaster. I‚Äôve still gotten with females but have been more interested in feminine men then ever before. I cut off anyone in my life that‚Äôs homophobic(pretty much every male friend I had) and just tried to be my true self. I tried to accept myself but felt like I was still living a double life until 2 weeks ago this all changed. One of my platonic female friends had some of her friends over 10-15 of us a few guys mostly girls to just chill and watch tv. One of them is a flirt gay (this is important). Night was fine but eventually the girls asked some of the guys to get them coffee and me and him went because I was just trying to be nice and so was he. We got in his car and he pecked my check and I started blushing and he turns to me and says trust me I know you and started laughing. I felt really embarrassed and then he convinced me to hook up with him and I‚Äôm ngl it felt completely normal and I loved it. I asked him to please keep this between us and he agreed and said dw I like the fun of it being my little secret. Ever since then I‚Äôve been thinking I‚Äôm bi but I‚Äôm attracted to femine oriented people and have started to become feminine oriented myself as more habits,behaviours lead towards traditional feminine activity. I don‚Äôt live in an open accepting household and if I came out I‚Äôd get shamed.  I just need people to talk me through this because I‚Äôm really been stressing out over this and is coming my life. Is it so wrong I just want to live a life I‚Äôm scared to win. I just want people to like me for who I am, not who I feel obligated to pretend to be.

If anyone has any comments or just can offer to talk to me it‚Äôd be huge and I‚Äôd love it. More than anything I have lots of weight on me and just want to release it and be myself to someone at least!",3,1733115536.0,AskBiBros,0,1.0,False

Changes are driving me crazy (alternate reality?)

Ok. So I might be out of my mind with this, but really need to get it out. Alternate reality possibly? So a few months ago I had to go out of state for work. Being hard headed I drove. Driving to wasn‚Äôt bad, I left early and got to my destination pretty late. When I left,
I had to leave a little after 12:00 noon, which already put me in a bad situation of being tired. 

Nothing crazy happened the first 8 hours of driving. Then it hit me. 8 started getting tired. I am to the point in my life when it‚Äôs time for bed, it‚Äôs time for bed. I pushed through. After killing a few cans of monster throughout the drive. I was struggling. Around 4:00 in the morning highway hypnotism hit hard. I caught myself a few times getting hit with micro sleep. I stopped and got some coffee, which I‚Äôm not a huge coffee drinker, so I hoped it would help. I was about 2 hours from home or so I felt like I was nodding off. Next thing I know, after feeling myself nodding, I became wide awake. Like I had that final push, but it was like I wasn‚Äôt even tired whatsoever. I figured the coffee kicked in. 

The issue. Ever since I have been back there have been some weird changes. My wife of over 15 years all of a sudden has came at me with us having issues. Things we had previously had issues with, I figured had been figured out. But not it‚Äôs all at once. When I left things were great, but not we aren‚Äôt doing so well. My kids have had some minor changes. Mainly some talent in sports. Things that were never an issue are now major things. Some school stuff is different and things they once liked, they don‚Äôt.

I was watching a YouTube video and they talked about alternate universes. Well, I‚Äôm sitting here thinking ‚Äúwhat are the chances or when I nodded off during my trip, I died and woke up in a different universe?‚Äù Again, like I said, there‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôm crazy. I think I might be and I‚Äôm over thinking this. Glitch in the matrix/alternate reality? What are your thoughts on all of this?",3,1733115535.0,ParallelUniverse,1,0.8,False

\-Xander: Planet Unknown: Time Unknown

Xander slept remarkably that night. The day before had been terrible and he fell asleep almost as soon as he hit the pillow. His roommate didn‚Äôt sleep in the bed with him that night, which was a little strange but he didn‚Äôt question it. It probably had something to do with his attitude towards him.

He felt a lot better, although he was still sore and his allergies were acting up like crazy. He couldn't stop sniffling, trying to free his nasal cavity of whatever junk had built up there overnight. The seething rage he felt a day prior was now more like a nagging annoyance.¬†

The food puzzle had been the final indignity. He felt like a dog in a cage getting a treat for good behavior; insulting. He appreciated that they stopped prodding him after he showed signs of discomfort, but still. The whole situation felt humiliating and demeaning. Though he had to admit, it wasn't as bad as the colbue treatment.

Every time he thought back to that awful experience he got chills. Specifically when one wrapped his gigantic clawed hand around his neck and yanked him off of Amos. He was sure his head would fall off. Unfortunately, Factions 10 and 12 , (The Factions Amos traded with) are made up of mostly gorlomp and rothmodious colbue. The gorlomp race is particularly testy and likes to mess with humans, but they're not too bad if you can ignore them. The roth race is arguably the most terrifying, having sharp serrated fans on their arms and shins, sharp teeth, long fingers, thick claws, and sitting comfortably around 6-7 feet tall. They were thinner than the gorlomp and shorter than the duromondou, meaning they were the most nimble. The rothmodious love a good fight and they were practically foaming at the mouth when they saw how Xander was beating the shit out of Amos. He got the feeling they didn‚Äôt like him either. They were also very good at breaking humans; a little too good for Xander‚Äôs liking.

That was another thing Xander discovered while on the trade ship. Well, first, he found out the colbue talked too much for their own good and they could easily be manipulated into giving away too much information. But he also learned that ‚ÄúBreaking‚Äù a human meant breaking their spirit and making them obedient so they could be sold easily. They kept food and water away unless he was quiet (he didn‚Äôt eat much). They didn‚Äôt allow him to wear clothes, have a mattress, blankets, or any sense of comfort. They kept his ‚Äòcage‚Äô away from the other humans and his was about 6 degrees colder. They allowed him a normal enclosure for 6 hours on the second day to show him what he was missing. He refused to shut up and slept *next* to the mattress just to spite them.

From what he understood, humans were normally bought by people as house servants or something to show off and say, ‚ÄòLook how much money I have!‚Äô Humans were also not allowed to walk freely on Yarmage, they *had* to be owned one way or another. And an unbroken human was considered worthless. Well, Xander had thoroughly gotten on everyone‚Äôs nerves by the end of his trip and he caught one of them talking about keeping him on the trade ship as a janitor. He had successfully brought down his price so much that he wasn‚Äôt even worth selling. He was pretty proud of that.¬†

So yes, all things considered, these fuzzy guys weren‚Äôt so bad. All morning, he was thinking of how he could try to communicate with them, as daunting as that was. Starting with his name was a good idea, he thought. Unfortunately, he didn‚Äôt get the chance, because he was ushered into the vehicle again immediately after breakfast. He was relieved to see they were going in a different direction than the lab. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he could take another day of all that without murdering someone.

His roommate put on some music in the vehicle, which was lovely. It was very similar to Earth's prewar classical music although he rarely heard it. Music players that worked were a rare find. The music he heard was usually from an old guitar and the voices of the colony. He barely remembered the songs his dad taught him, one about sunshine and another about American pie. The tunes came to him randomly but he could never remember all the words.¬†

They pulled up to a bigger house than the one he was staying in. It was made of sharp stone on the outside lined with clay. It looked more like a normal brick house than a dirt hut like the other one. It had a green lawn with strange-looking flowers scattered across it. Vibrant colors and sharp shapes, some big and some tiny. The door was wooden and large. When they approached, it opened, and Xander was relieved to see the tall familiar alien in the doorway. He looked down at Xander with dark ears and then spoke to the roommate.¬†

Immediately after entering the house, Xander could tell something was different. There was a savory smell in the air, symmetrical decorations lined the walls, and music was playing somewhere. He hadn't realized the other place smelled of dust and dander until he walked into this one. The wood floor was clean and polished. It felt good to put his bare feet on something clean. A couple of healthy luscious plants sat on small tables as decoration.¬†

A higher voice echoed in from the other room and when she rounded the corner, everything became clear. This was a woman's home with a woman‚Äôs touch. She was wearing a pink tunic with embroidered flowers along the bottom hem, and actually, she looked quite lovely. She wore gold jewelry that day the same style as before, with three earrings on the top of each ear connected by chains down to one at the bottom. She had two rings on each hand, a long gold necklace with a pink charm at the end, and three chunky bracelets on her left wrist. Her beige fur was laid down on her face and fluffed on her head.¬†

She greeted the roommate warmly and touched palms with him (probably similar to a handshake). Her dress was smoothed out before she bent on her haunches towards Xander, surprising him. She said something and held her palm up to him. The tall alien shifted uncomfortably while the roommate crossed his arms and smiled softly. Xander reached out and touched palms with her. It was nice to be properly welcomed into her home; like a guest.¬†

There was a bit more talk before the two males reluctantly left. The roommate had given the woman his journal before leaving and then he was alone with her. She put all of her arms on her hips and looked down at him. Her demeanor was calming; limbs relaxed, ears perked and beige, lips soft and brought up into a smile. She was content.¬†

Xander quickly realized that the littlest one was there too. It trilled and crawled around the corner of the couch in what he assumed was the living room. The woman turned her attention there and went over to pick them up off the ground. She held the little little thing on her hip looking like a ball of fluff.¬† Xander followed her and the savory smell intensified. Something was cooking in the kitchen, and it wasn‚Äôt oatmeal.¬†

Although he could barely smell it through his snot-stuffed nose, it turned his stomach. He didn‚Äôt feel all that great for some reason. A headache was starting to form, his muscles ached, and he felt a sneezing fit coming on. Just as he suspected, five sneezes back to back exploded from him painfully. He made sure to cover his nose in his tunic. A guttural groan escaped him, like an old man, and he coughed a few times before sighing gruffly. His head was really pounding now. The woman looked down at him curiously and her ears were dark. He hoped she knew what a sneeze was or that must have looked pretty bizarre.¬†

\- Nyam: Planet Xire: Time 0800

Blat had given her the projectile armed with a sedative, but she highly doubted she‚Äôd need it. He seemed pretty calm all things considered, and actually, he looked a bit sickly. His dark complexion was somehow paler and he kept making strange noises and gestures. He sniffed quite a bit, but Sthalsh had told her it didn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything so she ignored it. Soon after he arrived, however, he started‚Ä¶ coughing loudly? Or maybe it was a bark? Hard to say but it was loud and it looked painful. He groaned after every fit of it.

He pretty much followed her anywhere she went and it was adorable. He was very cute actually and she had no idea why Blat thought he was ugly. His small hands, beady eyes, and soft hair made it hard for her not to pet him, but Sthalsh had said he might not like that. He was very interested in everything she did, especially when cooking. She was making slow-cooked vegetable soup for dinner. He did his best to see what was on the counter but he was too short. So cute! She told him what it was and exactly how she made it, down to every last boring detail, and to her surprise, he seemed interested in what she had to say.¬†

Meff was in a good mood and was interested in Creature. She kept reaching out to him, and Creature would wave his hand at her with a smile. An odd gesture to be sure. In fact, everything he did was odd in one way or another. He was an alien after all, but Nyam hadn‚Äôt expected him to be all *that* foreign.¬†

There was one point where he walked over and sat down next to Meff but it looked like he was waiting for permission, the way he looked back at her with raised brows before sitting down. He only sat down after she gave him a nod. Meff immediately waddled over to him and plopped down in his lap, jabbering nonsense. He picked her up with ease even though she was nearly his size. He started making noises at her, gently tossing her in the air and nuzzling noses with her when she came back down. It reminded Nyam of how Blat played with her. Meff trilled and squealed; she was loving it.¬†

\-Xander: Planet Unknown: Time Unknown

He was really enjoying his time with the woman and the small child. They were pleasant to be around. And the woman actually *talked* to him multiple times. Of course, he couldn‚Äôt understand what she was saying but still, it was nice to be acknowledged. The little child was simply precious. It had really taken to him it seemed, and Mom didn‚Äôt mind that he was playing with the little thing. The fur was unbelievably soft almost like it was down fur that would shed once the little tyke got to a certain age. He wasn't sure of its gender only that it was young. He made sure to walk away from them when he thought a sneezing fit was coming on; he really didn‚Äôt want to pass on whatever he was coming down with.¬†

A couple of times the woman tried to feed him but he wasn‚Äôt feeling all that hungry. His stomach felt like it was doing cartwheels and he didn‚Äôt want to push it. Probably the oatmeal he‚Äôd been fed for the past four days catching up with him. Mostly, the woman kept to herself and left Xander to his own devices.¬†

The house was laid out similarly to the other, but it had a separate room for the low-set dining table connected to the kitchen. The living room had two couches in an ‚ÄòL‚Äô pattern on the far wall facing a large stone fireplace. There was a door adjacent to the living room that he assumed was the master bedroom. A strange scratching noise came from that room, most likely some kind of pet like a dog or cat. There was an upstairs but he didn‚Äôt go up there. The steps were huge, almost as tall as his legs. Gosh, everything was big in that house; to a frightening degree. The other house was too cluttered to feel so massive.¬†

After exploring, he went back to the woman and was pleased to find her doing something that looked like knitting with her bare feet propped up on the coffee table. Her four hands moved in unison weaving back and forth with blue string. He couldn‚Äôt even begin to guess what she was making. The radio was playing some kind of talk show or drama, he couldn‚Äôt decide which one was more likely. The child was playing with toys on the floor. Xander crawled up on the couch and sat next to her listening to the radio but not understanding a word of it. The thought of speaking with her had popped up in his head a few times that day, but the desire was particularly strong then.¬†

A bark interrupted his thoughts. Whatever was in the other room was finally tired of being left out. He noticed the woman‚Äôs finger tapping her knitting utensils. *Please don‚Äôt do what I think you‚Äôre going to do*. She looked down at Xander and he instantly knew what she was thinking, but she obviously couldn‚Äôt read *his* thoughts.

She rose from her spot and went over to the big door that wasn‚Äôt all that big next to her. As soon as she opened it a giant monster-looking‚Ä¶*thing* burst out of the room. It was 4-5 feet tall and 5-6 feet long not including its long wiry tail that swung back and forth rapidly. It had a long naked face with a wide maw lined with sharp canines and a slobbering tongue draped over the side. Its body was completely covered in short black fur and had six black eyes, six legs, and two large pointed ears like a rabbit. The two legs in the back were just a touch longer forcing it into a constant predatory stance. The paws were elongated like weird little shoes with long claws on the end. It was like a fucked up dog/spider hybrid from hell.¬†

Xander immediately tensed up and scooted back on the couch as far as he could. Maybe if he stayed still it wouldn‚Äôt notice him. Much to his dismay, it did. After rushing over to the child and nudging it gently, the monster noticed Xander and started growling, quickly becoming a loud bark. Every part of Xander was telling him to get the *fuck* away from it, immediately! Its tongue flailed around in its mouth like it didn‚Äôt have control over it and Xander could have sworn it was forked like a snake. The woman scolded the animal and it sat down quickly stifling its bark. Xander hadn‚Äôt noticed he was white-knuckling the cushion. His heart was racing looking at the weird creature; it was fucking creepy as hell and he hated the woman for letting it out. *Surely* it could survive a few more hours in that room? Preferably *away* from the tasty fleshy human.

The woman sat down next to Xander and called the thing over. It moved way too much like a spider, which he hated with every ounce of his person, and he instinctively said quietly, ‚ÄúFucking hell.‚Äù He flinched and brought up his knees so it wouldn‚Äôt touch him. The woman‚Äôs ears pulsed red and she looked down at him. He knew she had heard him say something but he really didn‚Äôt care. Besides he was planning on talking to her anyway. He wished he knew the words for ‚Äòget that thing the fuck away from me!‚Äô¬†

She didn‚Äôt address that and instead, held out her palm to him. He wasn‚Äôt sure what she wanted so he didn‚Äôt move. She guided his hand over to the thing apparently to pet it, and he pulled it away shaking his head.

‚ÄúFuck no! I‚Äòm not touching that thing.‚Äù It felt weird for him to talk like his tongue had been asleep and wasn‚Äôt moving properly. But the cat was out of the bag now, no need to stay quiet anymore. Although he wished he had started with his name instead of ‚Äòfucking hell.‚Äô What a dumb way to reveal you can talk. Get scared of a demon dog and curse at it. She sniffed and scrunched her nose, he knew what that meant. She again grabbed his hand and brought it over to the animal. He closed his eyes and gave in to whatever she was about to do, trusting that the animal wouldn‚Äôt bite his fingers off. Warm wiry fur hit the palm of his hand and he exhaled hard through his teeth.¬†

He wanted to pet that thing about as much as he wanted to eat glass. As soon as she loosened her grip he roughly pulled his hand away. The animal didn‚Äôt care about him whatsoever. It was very well-trained but that didn‚Äôt make it any less gross. The thing ran off somewhere else apparently losing interest in the two of them. *Good riddance.* He couldn‚Äôt get the image of a giant spider out of his mind and a shiver traveled down his spine. What a disgusting creature. How in the world anyone could keep that as a pet was beyond him.

The woman was watching him and he hadn‚Äôt noticed. She put one of her four hands on his knee and he looked up at her. Another hand went to her chest and said something to him.

\-Nyam: Planet Xire: Time 1146

He definitely said something. If she didn‚Äôt catch it the first time, she caught it the second time. The words were harsh and clearly defined. It reminded her of rain on a metal roof. Or rocks falling down stone stairs. She looked down at him with pulsing ears. He looked terrified of Dopperven. She recalled what Blat had said about his adrenaline production although she didn‚Äôt believe him until that moment. Still, he wasn‚Äôt directing any of that toward her.¬†

Grasping his hand was electrifying; feeling the power in his arm yet the control he had over it. She was trying to show him that Dopperven was nothing to be afraid of however he didn‚Äôt seem convinced. As soon as she let up on her grip he pulled his hand away. He had *allowed* her to grab his hand and there was no doubt about that. Even though he was scared and confused, he hadn‚Äôt hurt her in the slightest, though he easily could if he wanted to.

She placed her bottom left hand on his left knee and he looked up at her. His eyes were so expressive. Little brown galaxies stared back at her. She placed a hand on her chest and said, ‚ÄúNyam.‚Äù She repeated her name trying to make him understand. He wasn‚Äôt quite getting it. She pointed at Meff and said her name to him. Then she pointed at him and called him ‚ÄòCreature‚Äô before pointing at herself again and saying her name. She could almost see the wheels turning in his head. He pointed a fleshy finger at her and tried his best to say her name but it sounded like his mouth was full of cloth. She trilled softly.¬†

‚ÄúNam?‚Äù He said

She shook her head. ‚ÄúNy-am.‚Äù

‚ÄúNyam.‚Äù¬†

She nodded, and he pointed at his chest and smiled so wide he was practically baring his teeth at her. He said something that sounded very foreign and she tried to repeat it. ‚ÄúZand?‚Äù

It was his turn to teach her pronunciation. He enunciated the last part with a hard sound and she found it hard to replicate.

\-Xander: Planet Unknown: Time Unknown

‚ÄúXundeirch?‚Äù

That was a rough one. It was actually worse than the first attempt. He shook his head and really tried to make it sound similar to their flittery language but the ‚ÄòER‚Äô was just too hard. Their language sounded a lot like French, Spanish, and German smooshed together. Every ‚ÄòR‚Äô was rolled and every ‚ÄòL‚Äô was soft. The ‚ÄòCH‚Äô sound was harsh though, like in French. On top of that, everything sounded like a song, each word carved into the next. English was very different.¬†

‚ÄúXandeir?‚Äù

Close enough. He nodded smiling with an open mouth feeling a sense of relief wash over him. She knew his name, and he knew hers. And apparently, the little kid was Meff. Awesome. Well, mission accomplished for the day. It didn‚Äôt quite happen like he had imagined but that‚Äôs okay. When the two men came back he could communicate with them and hopefully start learning their language. Hell, maybe he could find a way back to Earth! The possibilities were endless and the world was his oyster. He felt like a million bucks.

A cough interrupted his thoughts and soon he was hacking up quite a lot of junk. Whatever he was coming down with was slowly getting worse. Nyam‚Äôs expression changed when he coughed so he held up a palm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù he said, and he tried to sniff but found that he couldn‚Äôt. His nose had completely closed up. And now that he was thinking about it, his stomach was starting to turn over, and his throat hurt. He did not feel good at all. He brought his hand up to his forehead and was a little worried to feel a slight temperature increase. *Oh, no.*",18,1733115478.0,HFY,8,0.96,False

","okay some back story, my bf and i have been dating for about two years. we met on tinder and we never really became ""official"" until after knowing each other for a year. the first 9 months i knew him, we were both talking to other people, never exclusive. after knowing him for about a year and a 3 months, we kinda were in that ""exclusive"" state but never really made anything official, he would call me his girlfriend but never asked me to be his girlfriend. at one point, i found out he was still hooking up with another girl and when i asked him about it, i told him i wanted to be exclusive and he said he agreed he didnt want to lose me, blah blah blah. after that, he never really talked to other girls and i never questioned his loyalty. 

we started talking more seriously about our relationship this year as he moved 13 hours away and we are now doing long distance. we talked about how at the end of the year we could see ourselves engaged and me moving to where he is. we discussed what type of ring i would want, what size ring i am, when we'd want the ceremony, how much time/money we would need to plan for it all. i wasnt expecting anything until the end of this year. 

in july, my family went on a beach vacation and he drove down to join us. we talked about possibly having a date night, but it was all depending on how tired we were after the beach, etc. well on the trip i found out he hates the beach, while i love it. he wouldnt come to the beach with me and when he did it would be for maybe 30 minutes. now while i didnt mind this, he would be texting me the whole time wondering when i was coming back to the house. the second night we were there, we had a family game night and it didnt end until like 11. he asked after if i wanted to go on the beach (i thought his intention was to hookup) and we walked about 50 feet from the house and he got down on one knee. he asked if he had to ask the question and when i pushed he finally asked me to marry him. i said yes and we went back to the house. the ring he had gotten was nothing like i had described, didnt fit me, and i was so incredibly shocked. my family didnt find out what he was doing until 5 minutes before it happened. i had previously told him i wanted him to ask both my dad and my mom for ""permission"" to marry because i am extremely close to my family and i wanted my mom to feel included. come to find out, he didnt even talk to my mom about it, she found out through my dad. right after we came inside, everybody kinda shuffled off to bed since it was so late. that whole night i didnt sleep at all because i was filled with anxiety on if he's the right one. the next morning i went and sat on the beach by myself for a few hours, came inside and i had a breakdown with my mom. i started asking my what i should do, if i made a mistake by saying yes, i love him to death but did i make the right decision. i had a talk with him and told him i was disappointed with how the whole situation played out, gave the ring back, and told him i needed to sit with the idea of when we'd want to get married. 

the last few months, we've been in a constant battle between me moving to him or not, in addition to not having much of a physical relationship anymore because we only see each other once a month. he's not happy where he is and i told him im not moving myself around until he finds where he wants to be. i've made it very clear that i always want to move back home when we have kids and he would always be supportive of that, but i found out he told my mom and other close friends that ""once he takes me away from here i'll never want to move back"". i have constantly explained that it's not the place im attached to but my family, i want to raise my kids around my parents, my siblings and their kids. 

now brings in the family aspect. the entire time we've been together, he hasnt loved my family. after the proposal my mom really started disliking him and almost seemed to try to talk me out of being with him. she said she thinks he gaslights me (which i really dont think he does) and doesnt treat me special. i agree, that he doesnt make me feel special, he doesnt ever go out of his way to do something nice for me besides sending me $5 to get a coffee once every few months. he never really ""asked"" me to be his girlfriend, never bought me flowers (or picked me weeds), never really brought me on a proper date night, etc. because of everything that has happened the past couple of months, he refuses to be around my family. he cancelled his plans to come here for thanksgiving because he didnt want to be with my family, but he wants me to take a last minute trip with him this coming weekend to a new city he wants to move to. 

i love this guy to death, he really does have no bad intentions. i feel like a crappy person for thinking he doesnt do enough for me, but i just feel under appreciated?  i'm not sure if this is where i need to end our relationship or just keep living hoping it gets better.

I've been on YouTube since 2010 making videos, and watching videos. I've been through every era. RWJ, Cod Commentators, Casey, etc. And I find myself today only using YouTube to watch NFL coverage and occasionally ""Why Payless shoes became successful"" type videos. No more personalities.

It seems like that has completely gone to the wayside... And I understand the common argument, ""The small creators are still like that, and they're micro niched"" but that's the thing... It's all micro niches, not chill personalities.

All the esoteric YouTubers that I could be watching, make their videos scripted ""cinematic"" and so polished it's unbearable to watch for me. It's not real or raw. I was a professional cinematographer. Paid to shoot videos professionally, and the last thing I want to do is make my videos ""look movie quality.""

I only found one Youtuber that posts whatever the hell she wants and I love it - just she's not exactly catering towards me: Caroline Winkler. She has this Jenna Marbles energy without the star power. She'll post a home decorating video, or a coffee with me, or spilling the tea on some date she had. She's not for me, but I REALLY love to see how no matter what she talks about, she draws in a few hundred thousand viewers.

My videos are very formatted. I posted my first non-formatted video and of course its a 10/10. Same watch time, same like ratio, same ""depth"" to my message, just a less structured topic that's easy to box up in packaging. I understand that I was making a video that would fail, and happy to do it anyway... but it just makes me sad that I don't follow anyone that just posts whatever they want and can be real to the camera.

I get the algorithm is optimized for content buckets, so creators have to stick to repeatable, predictable formats to get ahead. But I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same way I do.",6,1733115429.0,PartneredYoutube,22,0.67,False

So I might be out of my mind with this, but really need to get it out. Alternate reality possibly? So a few months ago I had to go out of state for work. Being hard headed I drove. Driving to wasn‚Äôt bad, I left early and got to my destination pretty late. When I left,
I had to leave a little after 12:00 noon, which already put me in a bad situation of being tired. 

Nothing crazy happened the first 8 hours of driving. Then it hit me. 8 started getting tired. I am to the point in my life when it‚Äôs time for bed, it‚Äôs time for bed. I pushed through. After killing a few cans of monster throughout the drive. I was struggling. Around 4:00 in the morning highway hypnotism hit hard. I caught myself a few times getting hit with micro sleep. I stopped and got some coffee, which I‚Äôm not a huge coffee drinker, so I hoped it would help. I was about 2 hours from home or so I felt like I was nodding off. Next thing I know, after feeling myself nodding, I became wide awake. Like I had that final push, but it was like I wasn‚Äôt even tired whatsoever. I figured the coffee kicked in. 

The issue. Ever since I have been back there have been some weird changes. My wife of over 15 years all of a sudden has came at me with us having issues. Things we had previously had issues with, I figured had been figured out. But not it‚Äôs all at once. When I left things were great, but not we aren‚Äôt doing so well. My kids have had some minor changes. Mainly some talent in sports. Things that were never an issue are now major things. Some school stuff is different and things they once liked, they don‚Äôt.

I was watching a YouTube video and they talked about alternate universes. Well, I‚Äôm sitting here thinking ‚Äúwhat are the chances or when I nodded off during my trip, I died and woke up in a different universe?‚Äù Again, like I said, there‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôm crazy.

He went into the washroom to wash his hands and I took out some cash and put next to him.

Then I went to another subway station and mer a young Muslim person who was panhandling, I gave him some cash and offered to get him coffee but ge politely declined.

I then walked upstairs and met with an elderly who was looking into the moving crowd, so I put cash next to him, a pack of smoke, then offered him three apples, and asked what coffee would he like to have which he said triple triple, meaning three cream three sugar, and I got him a large cup. He repeatedly said God bless you to me, said name is Harvey.

Then I went in the train and immediately saw another unhoused person, I gave him a pack of smoke, a can of beer, two apples and cash. He said his name is Alfonso. He waved bye to me.

I then went to another subway station and met a young indigenous woman smoking in the waiting area, I asked if she wanted a pack and she said that would be awesome, and I gave it, then a can of beer, some cash, but when I took the apples for her she showed me her teeth and said she can't have them, she said her name is Cristina.

1h4n016,https://www.reddit.com/r/ListenToGrow/comments/1h4n016/what_is_the_trick_to_productivity/,What is the trick to productivity?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a wild journey trying to figure out the secret sauce to being more productive, and I thought I'd share what I've learned after years of trial and error.

Let me cut straight to the chase - there's no magic bullet for productivity. But there is something that's completely changed my game: building the right habits.

I used to be that person who'd write endless to-do lists and download every productivity app under the sun. Spoiler alert: none of that stuff really worked long-term. What actually made a difference was understanding how habits work and learning to build them strategically.

I recently stumbled upon this book called ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear, and it honestly blew my mind. The author breaks down exactly how tiny changes can lead to remarkable results. He explains that if you get just 1% better each day, you'll end up 37 times better by the end of the year. Pretty wild, right?

Here's what I've learned about building productive habits:

1. Start ridiculously small
Instead of saying ""I'll work for 3 hours,"" start with ""I'll work for 2 minutes."" It sounds silly, but it works because it removes the resistance to starting.

2. Stack your habits
Attach new habits to existing ones. For example, ""After I pour my morning coffee, I'll write one paragraph.""

3. Make it obvious
Want to read more? Leave a book on your pillow. Want to exercise? Put your workout clothes next to your bed.

4. Track your progress
Use a simple habit tracker (even a paper calendar works great).

The book goes into way more detail about these strategies and provides actual scientific backing for why they work. I've been listening to it on Audible (you can actually get it free with their trial at https://athometouch.com/atomichabits), and it's been super helpful having it in audio format because I can listen while doing other things.

One thing that really stuck with me is how our environment shapes our behavior more than we realize. I used to blame myself for lack of willpower, but now I understand that setting up your environment for success is way more important than motivation.

Some practical tips that have worked for me:

- Creating a dedicated workspace
- Using website blockers during focus time
- Setting up automatic reminders
- Breaking tasks into tiny, manageable chunks
- Celebrating small wins

The real trick to productivity isn't forcing yourself to work harder - it's building systems that make it easier to do the right thing and harder to do the wrong thing.

I've noticed that when I follow these principles, productivity feels less like a struggle and more like a natural flow. It's not about dramatic changes; it's about tiny improvements that compound over time.

Hope this helps some of you who are struggling with productivity like I was. Remember, it's not about being perfect - it's about being slightly better than yesterday.

It is profitable but not by a huge margin, it could definitely use some improvements/trials to improve profits without increasing expenses too much. It completes with Dunkin and their drive thru as well as other small gas stations for coffee & other restaurants for breakfast items. On the other hand we have a completed business plan for an arcade, which in the (hopeful) numbers shows a much larger profit and way lower expenses. And would have no competition for family entertainment within 28 miles. People are absolutely hurting for something to do which is why I wrote the business plan to present to a bank. The coffee shop we wouldn't need to borrow money, but the arcade we would need to borrow a pretty large sum which we would have a down payment and excellent credit to obtain a business loan. The coffee shop would be ours by the first of the year & the arcade would take possibly a few weeks/months to be approved and finalized.

My big question is, what would you do? If any additional information is needed that I forgot to mention, just ask! I am truly at a loss. My heart is in the arcade but my husband's is leaning more towards the coffee shop.",1,1733114068.0,Entrepreneur,14,1.0,False

They were just normal friends, nothing romantic. After we started dating, they stopped hanging out as much, but they still see each other maybe once a month. When they do, it‚Äôs usually to run errands, grab coffee, or for him to help her with things like moving furniture or fixing stuff around her house.

The thing is, he seems to idealize her a lot. For example, if I say something is good, he might dismiss it, but if she later says it‚Äôs good, suddenly, he agrees with her. It feels like he trusts everything she says over me.

Another thing that bothers me is that he doesn‚Äôt tell me what they talk about or message about. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking this or if it‚Äôs something I should be concerned about.

Am I wrong to feel weird about this? Has anyone else experienced something like this? How would you handle it?

Toasters are kitchen staples that transform our mornings with the simple act of turning bread into deliciously crisp slices. Among the myriad of options available, Breville toasters have carved a niche for themselves, blending functionality, style, and innovative technology. This article will delve into the history of Breville, the features that set their toasters apart, a comparison of popular models, maintenance tips, and much more.

# The History of Breville

Breville was founded in 1932 in Melbourne, Australia, by Bill O‚ÄôBrien and his wife, Betty. Initially, the company focused on manufacturing small kitchen appliances, including a sandwich toaster that quickly gained popularity. Over the decades, Breville expanded its product range, gaining a reputation for quality and innovation.

In the 1990s, the company began to make significant strides in international markets, particularly in North America. Today, Breville is known for its premium kitchen appliances, including coffee machines, blenders, and, of course, toasters. Their commitment to design, usability, and performance has made them a favorite among both home cooks and professional chefs.

# Why Choose a Breville Toaster?

# 1. Innovative Technology

Breville toasters are equipped with advanced features that enhance toasting quality. For instance, many models feature ‚ÄúA Bit More‚Äù technology, which allows users to add a little extra toasting time without needing to restart the entire cycle. This is particularly useful for bread types that vary in thickness or moisture content.

# 2. Even Toasting

One of the standout features of Breville toasters is their ability to toast evenly. Many models employ a ‚ÄúSmart Toasting‚Äù technology that ensures each side of the bread is toasted uniformly. This is achieved through a combination of heating elements and sensors that adjust the toasting time based on the bread‚Äôs moisture level.

# 3. Versatile Settings

Breville toasters offer a range of settings to accommodate different types of bread and toasting preferences. From bagels to artisanal breads, the adjustable settings allow users to customize their toasting experience.

# 4. Sleek Design

The aesthetic appeal of Breville toasters is undeniable. With a modern and stylish design, these toasters can complement any kitchen d√©cor. They are available in various finishes, including brushed stainless steel, which adds a touch of elegance.

# Price Range

Breville toasters typically range from around $80 for basic models to over $200 for advanced, high-capacity versions. While the initial investment may be higher than other brands, the quality and longevity often justify the cost.

# Maintenance and Care

# 1. Regular Cleaning

To keep your Breville toaster in top shape, it‚Äôs important to clean it regularly. Remove the crumb tray and empty it after each use. Wipe the exterior with a damp cloth to prevent buildup of grease and crumbs.

# 2. Avoiding Overloading

While it may be tempting to toast multiple slices of thick bread at once, overloading can lead to uneven toasting and potential damage. Always follow the manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines regarding maximum capacity.

# 3. Storing Safely

If you need to store your toaster, make sure it‚Äôs unplugged and completely cool. Avoid wrapping the cord tightly around the toaster, as this can damage the cord over time.

# 4. Checking for Wear and Tear

1h4msu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Photographytales/comments/1h4msu0/capturing_audi_calabasas_a_photoshoot_full_of/,Capturing Audi Calabasas: A Photoshoot Full of Surprises,"Being a photographer, especially for my 9-to-5, comes with its fair share of challenges and unexpected moments. While I usually shoot cars for dealership websites, every now and then, I get assigned something a little more special. On this particular day, my assignment was to photograph the newly renovated Audi Calabasas building. The dealership had just completed a massive renovation, and it looked like an architectural masterpiece‚Äîa sleek, modern structure that felt as luxurious as the cars it housed.

It was late afternoon in October when I arrived, and the building was bathed in the last rays of sunlight. Customers were coming and going, walking through the giant glass doors, while I stood in front of the building, setting up my tripod and camera. The sun was slowly disappearing behind the hills next to the dealership, and I knew I had just a narrow window to capture the perfect shot.

As the sun dipped lower, the light spilling over the top of the building created a magical effect. The hill acted like a shield, blocking the harsh light while still illuminating the upper portion of the dealership. I stood there, waiting for the exact moment when the last bit of sunlight would fade, signaling the start of my photoshoot. The anticipation was building, and I could almost hear that perfect click in my head.

And then‚Ä¶ it happened.

No, not the beautiful golden hour I was expecting‚Äîa car pulled up right in front of my shot. Of course. In my head, I was laughing and pulling my hair out at the same time. Why did this have to happen at *that* moment? I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, no big deal, maybe I can Photoshop it out later.‚Äù I adjusted my camera and got ready for the next shot, trying to remain calm.

But before I could hit the shutter, another car pulled up. And then another. It was like the universe had conspired against me, sending car after car to block my perfectly planned shot. I started to think I must be in some sort of candid camera situation‚Äîwhere was the hidden crew waiting to see my reaction?

At this point, I knew I was running out of time. I had about 30 minutes left to get at least three solid exterior photos, and I hadn‚Äôt even made it inside yet. With each passing car, I was losing hope. And just when I thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse, a fourth and fifth car pulled up. I had to laugh at the absurdity of it all. Sometimes, the only way to deal with these moments is to find the humor in them.

I finally snapped a few shots, knowing they weren‚Äôt going to be perfect, and moved on to another part of the building. Three exposures here, three there‚ÄîI was working as quickly as possible, trying to make the most of the fading light. I moved around to the back of the building and took some shots of the service area, hoping that the interior shoot would be a bit smoother.

But once inside, I realized the challenges weren‚Äôt over. The dealership was buzzing with activity‚Äîcustomers exploring the showroom, admiring the shiny new Audis, and walking through my frames. I knew I had to move fast. The cars on display were stunning‚Äîparticularly a lime green Audi RS3 and an orange SQ8 that seemed to demand attention. They were like the stars of the showroom, ready for their close-up.

Shooting around customers was a bit like playing hide-and-seek. I‚Äôd set up my shot, wait for them to step out of frame, and then quickly snap the picture before anyone else wandered in. It was a game of patience and timing, but I was determined to get those shots. At one point, I found myself crouching behind a couch in the waiting area, trying to capture the perfect angle without being in anyone‚Äôs way. It felt a bit ridiculous, but that‚Äôs the life of a photographer‚Äîyou do what you have to do to get the shot.

I managed to capture five beautiful shots of the showroom, but I still needed one more‚Äîthe main entrance. I set up my camera, ready to take the final image, but of course, just as I was about to shoot, a group of customers sat down right in the middle of the frame. I was so close to being done, and now it looked like I wasn‚Äôt going to get that last crucial shot.

But then, I remembered‚Äîwhen I first arrived, I had taken a few test shots of the showroom. They weren‚Äôt perfect, but one of them was from the exact angle I needed. I smiled to myself, relieved that I had a backup plan. Sometimes, those early test shots end up saving the day.

As the day came to a close, I decided to try one last idea. I set up for a panoramic shot of the entire building, taking six sets of three bracketed images. For those who aren‚Äôt photographers, bracketing is when you take multiple exposures of the same scene to later merge them into a high-dynamic-range (HDR) image. It‚Äôs a bit of a tedious process, but the results can be stunning, especially for a building like this one.

By the time I finished, the light was gone, and the shoot was officially wrapped. But as any photographer knows, the work doesn‚Äôt end when you leave the location. Back at home, I sat down with a hot cup of coffee and opened Lightroom, ready to start the editing process. It‚Äôs always a bit of a thrill going through the images, seeing what worked and what didn‚Äôt.

As I edited, the lime green RS3 and the orange SQ8 looked even better than I remembered‚Äîthese cars were made to be photographed. And then I reached the panoramic shot. It had been a long day, and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had the energy to work on such a complex image, but something told me to go for it. I spent about an hour fine-tuning it, making sure every detail was perfect.

A few days later, I got an email from the dealership asking if I could adjust the aspect ratio of the panoramic shot. I made the changes, sent it back, and crossed my fingers. Then I got the best news: the panoramic shot was going to be the main image on the Audi Calabasas website. It was a moment of pure satisfaction‚Äîafter all the roadblocks, that shot had ended up being the highlight of the shoot.

If you visit the Audi Calabasas website on a desktop, you‚Äôll see the image front and center. On mobile, you‚Äôll have to switch to the web version and turn your phone sideways, but it‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs moments like these that make all the challenges worth it. Photography is about capturing beauty, but it‚Äôs also about resilience‚Äîsticking with it when things don‚Äôt go as planned and finding a way to create something amazing despite the obstacles.",1,1733113824.0,Photographytales,0,1.0,False

Well when I walked into our bathroom to see the tub full with bath water, and two towels and clothes on the floor.. I think the water was still hot though it felt hot but, I don't know I'm not going to touch someone's else's bath water lol.

 Either way I just assumed whoever was bathing probably forgot their stuff and was going to grab it by the time I got back. And trust me it did take awhile because I had to wipe down all the counters and table, stack all the chairs on the table, put dishes into the dishwasher, and finally sweep up. (it was my moms turn to do after dinner cleanup)

 But by the time I got back upstairs everything was still there, I was a little annoyed and I wasn't going to touch someone's else's bath water or clothes that's weird and gross 

 so i reported to the staff that someone's stuff was still in the bathroom and the tub was still full so she told me to bring her upstairs to see herself and immediately she recognized whose stuff was on the ground and went straight to the pregnant woman's room 

The two argued and the pregnant woman yelled that she was going to go back in there to shower. So I awkwardly walk back into our room which keep in mind our room is next to hers and the staff made sure to say ""she wants to bath her brother"" which just made it more great huh?üò≠

Honestly before any of that even happened I did tell the staff that it was okay and I can wait til later to shower him but, she clearly didn't listen to me.

I should probably mention that this isn't the first time this pregnant woman did something like this..my mom told me the other day that herself and another older lady who lives on the senior side was in the kitchen having coffee, and apparently this pregnant woman made toast and put a bunch of maple syrup on it just to end up not liking it and leaves her plate there thinking my mom or the other lady will clean up it up for her. And another bunch of times she never cleans up after she uses the tub, which is a rule to clean up after you use the shower or tub.  For some reason everyone upstairs never really said anything about her leaving a mess after she was done using the tub, but to be fair everyone in the individual rooms that are upstairs with us seem pretty shy/keep to themselves.


My mom told me I shouldn't even have said anything, that I don't know what it's like to be pregnant, and that she's almost due, but I just wanna know aita?üòì",1,1733113674.0,AITAH,4,0.99,False

My stool is extremely loose, and I am not passing any normal stool. In addition, I see undigested pieces of food in my stool too. ugh. I was perfectly fine, but then the antibotics triggered my ibs. also this sounds weird, but I used to have a routine when I would go to the restroom. Like i only needed to go once a day at the same time. but now its like crazy. also, maybe it is something else. cuz junior year has made me drink a lot of caffiene like coffee and have less sleep, but i don't really think this is it cuz i would know yk. any advice?",1,1733113468.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

In my free time, you might find me exploring the world, scuba diving, riding motorcycles, or perfecting a new dish in the kitchen. I‚Äôve even renovated my house entirely on my own! I also love woodworking, boating, catching up on a binge-worthy show, and spending quality time with family. Living a healthy, active lifestyle is important to me, and I‚Äôd love to find someone who shares that same mindset.

I‚Äôm looking for a partner in her 20s or early 30s who‚Äôs kind-hearted, emotionally available, and walking a good path in life. Bonus points if you‚Äôre just as excited about building a loving family as I am!

This machine was recently released from Espresso Outlet and streamed a bit by Hoon coffee on YouTube.

I haven't been able to find more info but from watching the stream and QA with Espresso outlet it seems:
1. PID controlled at steam temp
2. Heat exchange
3. E61 group head

Now emailing the people from Espresso Outlet I wanted info of if this is some new brand or something. I was told their manufacture is Gemilai.

Apparently Gemilai is a manufacturer almost all companies use if they outsource to china (or so l'm told).

Just wanted to know general opinion about this machine since it's so new. Its price is great and it seems like a comparable machine against Lelit Mara X or Pro 400/500?

Any opinions? Is this worth a risk? Like is this a bigger risk as compared to Meraki?

It is all interconnected. Also, I am taking testosterone replacement supplements (Jatenzo 158 mg) a day. So it seems maybe the trt and Prime were not working together. 

So I stopped a few days ago. Third day, he worked like a charm.
