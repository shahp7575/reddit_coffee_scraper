I’ve been in Pune for 5 years but still don’t have a real social circle here. I moved from Delhi, and since I work remotely + got married here, I never really met people on my own.

I tried connecting with my husband’s friends’ wives, but the vibes didn’t match , lots of judgment, especially about me being child-free. I’m 37, independent, happily married, and just prefer light, easy conversations over the typical “kids, in-laws, saas-bahu” topics.

I love meeting people, exploring the city, grabbing coffee/drinks, watching a movie or stand-up ,  just normal hangouts without drama or boasting. But honestly, I haven’t found anyone with a similar mindset. Women my age usually have different priorities, and online, the few men I spoke to turned creepy way too fast.

So I’m putting this out here:
If you’re in Pune, chill, mature, non-judgmental, and looking for genuinely easy-going friendship (regardless of gender), hit me up. I just want a couple of good people I can say, “Hey, want to grab chai?” to , without it becoming weird.

If this resonates with anyone, feel free to DM. :)

**(intro music)**

Ooooh hello beautiful. 

Guess what?

It's episode 9 of confessions of a human miiiiind. **\[Transcriber's Note: He says this in a way that just instantly made me think ""oh wow he's fucked up and not even trying to hide it anymore, eh?"" Plus also...not to mention...the title says E10...I just. Can't with this idiot, lmfaoooo.\]**

**(more intro music)**

I have celebrated my amazing good fortune about getting my youtube back. They reinstated my ass. And I'm so grateful that I've overeaten. I've eaten a ton of sweets. 

Oh go to my youtube. Stephen Hilton. Youtube. Go there. Subscribe if you aren't. Because some of you...I've been banned for TWO YEARS on youtube. And uh. Last week. Th-sorry, this...this week just gone...I got a message saying. ""People are saying your youtube's back up."" And I've heard this before and I got all excited and I looked and it wasn't back up. 

So I was like ""Ok, I'll have a look...what's...what can I...what could be wrong with having a look?"" Well...I go to youtube. And to my astonishment. There's my channel. Had half a million subscribers when they banned me. It's got 400...and...12...413, now...I duno what happened there. Maybe it'll go back up again. **\[TN: In today's episode, old man skeeves learns what happens when your channel is banned and lays dormant for 2 years. As usual, he's the last to know, lmfao.\]**

So I need your support. So people that are here and like me, or even if you don't...um...although why you would be on Patreon when you don't like me is a mystery to me. But some of you, I d...I d...I don't know... **\[TN: Because some of us, not naming any names, can be there for free in perpetuity without it meaning anything to your crusty ass, lmfao.\]** No, I thi...I think most of you here are my true inner circle, so. I love you guys, and you're...you're...you're my main audience, you've stuck with me through all this. But if you dooooo like me and you aaaaare here and you're like ""Oh yeah, I wana give him a little bit of support after a tumultuous year."" Head over to Youtube, just search me, the one with 400 odd...just drop me a little sub...subscribe. Why not? 

It's guna be a lot of fun. I've got a lot of incredible plans for the channel, inculding...my series. I have a series in...in...pre-production. Uh, in...actually in production, I've got...I've got...half of my crew, I've got half of my cast. It's uh...it's the little piece that I had on instagram on a couple of weeks ago, you might have seen me writing the theme. It's called Lux Aeterna. Uh. And it's...a crazily structured retelling of the last year of my life. Um. That's...incredibly unexpected. And there...there's such a twist and such a...a bombshell in there that I can't tell you too much about it, cuz I want it to be a surprise. But guess where it's going? Youtube! And guess who was losing faith in ""Why am I even doing this?"" It's guna cost me about 10 grand, and who's guna see it. I was having a wobble this weekend and I was like ""What's the point."" I spent two months working on this script, two months working on this treatment. It's been a real labor of love. And I got it to a really good place, and this weekend...this last weekend, I was like ""Who cares, who's even guna see it?"" Has to be vertical, and the thing I'm shooting first is a 2 shot with 2 people in it. What am I doing. What's the point. I got really depressed and I...I didn't wana use, but I was like ""What's the point of being sober, what's the point of anything, what's the point of me trying...anything...with all this backlash and all people banning me and...I got really down and really depressed. Really depressed. **\[TN: But he doesn't have depression or anything...\]** 

Which is unusual for me. And I couldn't move...I couldn't...I'll be honest, I couldn't even leave bed. I s...I wasn't in bed all day but I spent most of the weekend in bed watching movies, uh, and going ""Why can't I do that? I really wana make a movie."" I lo...I love movies, I'm a movie composer. And I spent all this time with amazing directors in the same room, just me and them, like people like Baz Luhrmann, Christopher Nolan, y'know...Luc Besson. I spent all this time with people and I've got all this experience and I...why...I just wana make a film, and I think maybe some of this has rubbed off on me. Maybe soe of this experience of working with these people may have, who knows, I may...have learned a few things. 

Well, we're about to find out. I think we're shooting the first thing in about 2 weeks. **\[TN: So you have half a cast and half a team, but you're...shooting in 2 weeks? Man...how people hear him speak in circles and aren't constantly calling to have him institutionalized is beyond me, lmfao.\]** Uuuuuh and I am so excited and so terrified and so nervous. I've directed before, I directed videos that have gone super viral, so...um...and cowritten them, so I've got experience. I can lean on that and I can lean on all the time I spent with truly great dramatic directors... David Fincher I worked with w...on an iPhone commercial. **\[TN: Ah yes, the pinnacle of drama...an iPhone commercial. Pfffft.\]** I've worked with so many amazing directors. And uh...James L. Brooks, the uh creator of The Simpsons, and the Tracy Uhlmann show, aaaaaand the Mary Tyler Moore show. I worked with him. A lot. Um. Ron Howard. I went to Chicago with Hans Zimmer to meet Ron Howard. Y'know...y...surely there's a reason that all that happened, I'm thinking. Surely the reason for that is...my...m...my first short film...Lux Aeterna. 

So yeah, I'm so excited. But having my youtube back is such a blessing and it's such a like...a prodding towards positivity that I really needed this weekend. And, y'know me going to two AA meetings a day...averaging...and uh, got 107 days clean and sober today. I drug tested twice today...I mean I...I'm wondering why I signed myself up for such an intensive outpatient rehab, because it's 6 months of insane 3 hours a day, and I feel like AA is the thing that's keeping me sober right now. Um, so...I'm second guessing it a little bit. But, I think it's...y'know it's good...**\[TN: Yeah you know drug addicts, famously good with their decision making especially with regard to going to/staying in rehab. (This isn't a dig at addicts in general, it's a dig at skeevo trying to get out of continued accountability for his fucked up actions.)\]**

**\[TN: Right here is where my son woke up and I had to take him through his morning routine, haha. Hence the delays.\]**

I've got...there's a projector whirring away in the background, can you hear that? Hope you can't hear that. Remember last week I had to redo my podcast because it...there was a sound issue, so lemme just  get some headphones and put those on. I'll be back in a minute, can ypu hear that whirring sound, that's what I'm worried about. **\[TN: No, actually, there's literally no whirring in the background, but ok crazypants, lmfaooooo.\]** Uhhhhhohhhhh...course I don't have headphones handy, I'll just move over here to my other chair. 

I'm watching, uh, my favorite film. I discovered this film when I was relapsed. And it's turned into my favorite film. And I've must have watched it, I'm not kidding, definitely over 10 times. **\[TN: My favorite film is A League of Their Own and I've seen that at least 100 times in my 33 years of life, most probably more, but go off I guess skeeves.\]** In the past 5 months. There Will Be Blood. Everything about it, I absolutely love. I'm absolutely obsessed with it. Daniel Day Lewis. Paul Thomas Anderson. Johnny Greenwood's score, the guy from Radiohead. Everything about it, the cinematography. Everything, it's just so inspiring. Daniel Plainview, do I feel like I have something in common with him? Yes, I think we all do. My dark side is definitely a bit plainviewy. And if you know the story, don't freak out. I'm not completely like that, but I've got elements of that. And I've also got elements of lovely people. **\[TN: Whomst? Because we've yet to see that, lmfao.\]**

So. 

It's a recurring theme for me, isn't it, darkness and light. But I definitely identify with a lot of the um...the crazier stuff that Daniel Plainview says, that I go online and people are like ""That guy's a psychopath to say that."" And I'm like...uuuuuuuuh. You don't identify with some of that? Cuz I do. I...I...pffffff...y'know, I just...I do...I'm being honest...you know me, I'm honest. **\[TN: Is the honesty in the room with us?\]** I definitely can identify with Daniel Plainview in some ways. 

I'm guna put my headphones on to see if I...now d...\*BIG SIGH\*...let me see if you can...that's me now, talking to you, and that's me talking to you and listening to myself, and checking to see if you can hear me, if you can hear the projector, can you hear that? I can't in the headphones, so it should be good. It's loud though. I got the projector for my kids, so I got a cheap one, cuz I was like th...let's see if they even like the idea of watching movies on the big screen with the projector. Do they like it? Oh my god they're obsessed...they're obsessed with it. So. It was a good move. But now, I...because I...I got a cheap one, it's really loud. And it's like...got a fan in it, so...it's...hard to um...the films have to be really loud, so I wana get a new one. 

It's been raining in LA, which is unusual .Raining, tipping down. And of course I have a little leak in my roof because most houses in LA weren't built for the rain. Someone told me that um...one of the reasons a lot of houses leak in LA, like if I go to my local home depot when it's raining, cuz I've had a leak and I go there, I went there once for s...some...thing to stop the leak and there was a queue around the block **\[TN: No there wasn't, lmfao.\]** because every house where I live in LA was leaking. And someone told me it's because when they build the houses, they don't have rain so they don't see if there's a leak. So. My house was built in 1959, I think, and there's two leaks. There's one in my wardrobe, which isn't great, and there's one in the dining room, which isn't great. And my studio used to flood, my recording studio which, I turned my garage into a recording studio, and that used to leak...I'm not kidding there would be 2 inches of water on the floor of the entire garage, after I turned it into a studio every time it rained. And I had like 8 insurance people out. 8 different people. 8 contractors and insurance people trying to find this leak and they couldn't find it. No one. It was a mystery. No one knew where the water was coming in. Everyone was like ""This is crazy, I don't understand wh...where the water's coming from and why s...there's so much of it."" And everyone assumed it was coming through the garage door, and my mum was here and she goes ""I think it's coming from the other side of the garage."" And me and my dad were like ""Oh no, that's crazy, no it can't...can't possibly be."" **\[TN: Misogynistic asshole.\]** Cuz there was a tiny trickle from one side of my garage and all the water would pool on the other side, so we thought, all the guys thought that it was from the other side somewhere.

So my handyman was here one day, and he was digging around the..s...bushes...to the side...side of my house...and, sure enough, the side that my mom said the leak might be coming from, the little trickle, massive hole in the side of my house. When he pulled the earth back, there was a big hole in the side of my house, and that's where all the flood was coming from. And ever since we fixed that, we don't have that big leak, but now...they say I might need a new roof. Y'know...so I'm avoiding that. I don't wana do new roofs...that sounds expensive, I know that's expensive so I'm not guna...just ignoring it. **\[TN: Mmmm we love a parent who finds it funny to joke about something that could be a real danger to his kids if the roof caved in, but sure. Funny haha.\]**

Um. So I'm going to see...um...one of the people I've cast for my short um...is a comedian and she has a show tonight, so I'm guna go and uh...check...check it out...um. It's...it's...like...fairly...it's like 20 minutes away, um. But I wanted to see if we could get something, cuz we had a...a talk on the phone about the...about uh, things, and we...we had a really funny conversation. And I was like ""I wonder if I could get some of that humor in the...in the thing we're shooting at the end of the month."" Cuz it's very dark. It's very dark, it's very twisted. Um, and I think some humor would be great to lighten it up a little bit. So. I wana get some of our conversation that we had in real life in...in the script, um. So that we can...not in the s...well...it has to be pretty well scripted because, we um...the camera moves in it are so locked to the dialogue. So the DP, the person who's shooting it, is guna be reacting to cues in the script to move the camera, um... again I don't wana give too much away but it's a very unusual. Very unusual piece of work, and it's all guna be in one shot, we hope. No edits. **\[TN: Mhm, sure, right, good luck with that. If your youtube video is any indication of your abilities, it's guna suck ass just like everything else you release.\]**

Um. This is just a little three minute part of the short, and we're guna start with this as a kind of test. So. The camera moves to the script are very very like...they're guna be very...um...exact, and very pinpoint. So improvisation's guna be hard, but I actually went on ChatGPT **\[TN: Oh my fucking god, kill me. Nothing, ever, NOTHING, this man comes up with is his own. Holy shit.\]** and I said ""How can you improvise in a s...a very heavily scripted and camera blocked scene."" Meaning...the camera blocking means where or when the camera moves. And it said, ChatGPT's great for this, it said...do a camera rehearsal, and work out between this line and this line...we're free to improvise and stuff. And um. We've got uh...a lighting guy, a proper lighting guy, which. In all my years of making content, I've never had a...I mean we did...Me and Laura did a...a show for MTV and we did a show for Comedy Central, and that had a proper crew with proper lights and sound, and...but I wasn't directing that and neither was she. So I've never had directorial experience of a lighting guy. I've had...I've worked with cinematographers but never lighting. So that's guna be interesting. And um. We're shooting in a very confined space so we're not guna have space for a sound guy, but he's...we've gotta have a sound guy, so that's guna be somehow recorded remotely. **\[TN: The more he talks about this, the more it sounds like a pipe dream that will literally never come to fruition as it's playing out in his head...no one hold your breath, lmfao.\]** 

It's very ambitious, and...yeah, I'm...I'm confident. I actually fired...I had another actress lined up to play the other part in this and I had to let her go because...she just wasn't right. She just...I-I...d...after speaking to her you get a good...I don't like to l...read...audition people for roles specifically by reading lines. I like to get to know them. And you can tell if someone's guna be good, and you can tell if you're guna spark with someone from talking to them. That's the most important thing, and the um...the woman that's playing the part now, we have a much better rapport, and the woman before...we just...it was a bit...it was hard to...we had an initial...really good initial conversation and the subsequent ones weren't so good, so...I just...didn't... I didn't feel like it was guna work, so I had to swap that actress out for the new one. And that's who I'm guna see tonight to um just...meet and...I don't...have we met? We haven't met in person, so, that's guna be interesting. It's just like half an hour and I'm guna come back. 

I feel like so full from eating so much. And uh, I'm so grateful to have my youtube back. Oh my god, I made a video about...Unbanned. Being unbanned. I got the actual moment that I discovered that I was unbanned, I captured it on my mobile **\[TN: Ok Grandpa, what are you 100?\]** so...some of the video is that. But yeah. God I didn't expect that. It was devastating when they took my youtube away, I didn't wana talk about it, cuz I didn't...I don't think I told anyone how devastated I was, I kept it all inside. And that explains why I'm so excited to get it back. 

And I'm really guna go all out on there in terms of content, like...y'know f...proper, ambitious, content...and uh...films like...I was thinking I would uh...I've been doing a lot of soul searching obviously in the first 3 or 4 months of sobriety, and um. I was thinking of um documenting some of that, cinematically, like...in in...little films. Going around, talking to people that I meet in sobriety. **\[TN: No one cares what you have to say, sir. I promise. There are a million others out there doing it 10x better than you'll ever be able to even imagine being capable of...twat.\]** I...I don't know there's so many options so many things to do and I'm...I'm obviously guna put the...the short film, the aeterna thing, it's guna go on there. Um. It's just great cuz it's a nice big platform and I've gotta build up...that I haven't...it's unmonetized but the only reason it's not monetized is cuz I haven't had 3000 hours of watch time in the last year, you have to have 3000 hours of watch time in the last year to get remonetized so...go and watch the content. **(creepy laugh)** Uh. And then I get my monetization back which will fund really ambitious projects I wana do over there. **\[TN: The projects you will never finish and just take money from idiots who believe you for some ungodly reason.\]**

So. 

I'm so excited. This feels like a new era for me in terms of storytelling and filmmaking and...and...y'know, they're making a quarter of the films they used to so, film scoring jobs are thin on the ground now, I know...composers that are much more famous than me that haven't worked for a year. So. Instead of chasing a film to score, I'm just guna write my own stuff and score it. Guna make my own films and score 'em. 

So. 

It's guna scratch my itch for film scoring, it's guna scratch my itch for filmmaking, it's guna scratch my itch for directing which I haven't done since me and Laura split, y'know, so. I'm just really really really positive, really really happy, and I'm not guna fuck it up this time. Um. I called Laura, cuz she's the only person that really knows what this...being an influencer's like, um, that I could talk to on an intimate sort of level about it, and talk about my insecurities and stuff. 

**\[TN: This is where I paused for coffee, because I had a flashback of me in my kitchen cooking dinner with a baby on my hip while my husband at the time stood there playing a video game on his phone and waxing poetic about how much he'd love to open his own restaurant because working under other people just wasn't for him and he had to be able to play by his own rules and blah blah blah blah. All while, at the time, I was also the only one with a job, taking care of our two kids and one cat and the house and the cooking and the cleaning and the doctors and the...etc...I duno why but he said he talked to Laura about his insecurities like she should give even a single fuck about anything positive in his life when he's worked so hard to tear her down over the past year, and I just. Yeah. Hooboy. Had to step away for a second, lmfao. Anyway.\]**

And uh. She was like ""This is a god shot. It's a gift of sobriety. Don't fuck it up."" And she's right. So I'm guna take that...advice to heart...and I'm guna try and...y'know, use it artistically. Still push boundaries, I'm just...that's me, it's guna be controversial. It's guna be...um, weird...I'm guna make it weird, I make everything weird. It's guna be uncomfortable. It's guna be stupidly honest. It's guna be oversharing. It's guna be TMI. It's guna be weirdness. That's what the channel has always been and that's what it's guna continue to be. But I wana put a little bit more budget...as I...when I get remonetized, I'm guna invest that money back into the content there, I've decided so...really give people some...valuable...art, y'know? **\[TN: You mean...like you promised to provide in return for subscriptions on patreon??? The multiple projects you've started and stopped and left behind during your long form manic episode due to drug and alcohol abuse???\]** 

Um. What else can I tell you.?

I had...I was with, just Alfie yesterday. I had Alfie for a one on one, I've got Poppy for a one on one next week, and I've got them both tomorrow. And it's been so wonderful, and Alfie helped me with the title card for the youtube video, I put some music on it, and we did it together, he helped me, he played the bit of guitar on it. **(laughs)** It's amazing. He's six and we don't con...y'know, we don't communicate verbally but he totally gets...he's so musical and he...the time that we were estranged, he got into movie scores. How crazy is that, he started to put movie scores on...on spotify. Just play them to listen to them and Laura was like ""Oh my god, he's...listening to like Hans Zimmer's score for Boss Baby."" I'm like ""What?"" I mean. It's just so bizarre. **\[TN: Of course all of the above is so totally thanks to skeeves, right? Definitely. You know that's 100% what he's thinking, too, lmfao.\]** So I'm really trying to involve him in um...music. And he's getting it. 

And we went to uh, an arcade. We went to the mall and we went into an arcade and we were shooting dinosaurs. And then he went into um...a ball pit, and he was like ""BALLS BALLS BALLS"" and I put the...put my credit card on the thing and a ton of balls fell on him, I didn't even know what this machine was, he just went in there and was like ""BALLS"" so he's obviously been in there before, but I texted Laura and asked ""Have you ever taken him to a mall?"" and she said ""Hell no, I-I...that's my...my worst nightmare."" So, I think the nanny, Carla, must have might have taken him in there cuz he knew the ball machine, and he was very excited for me to see it I think. But he was skipping and beaming the whole entire time, I don't think I've ever seen him so happy for four hours in my life as yesterday. He's just...on cloud 9 when we're together. Cloud. 9. And he's like...he'll stop and just give me a cuddle. Andd it's just beautiful and he'll look at me deep in my eyes, like he never did that before. And he's really trying to communicate, and...we just...we communicate differently, y'know? And uh, that's fine. I'm...I'm autistic too and uh...we get each other which is the main thing. **\[TN: I rolled my eyes so fucking hard here, I'm pretty sure I'm stuck infinitely staring into my own brain. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄\]**

Yeah it's just been an incredible week. Very bad weekend, incredible week, uh. So. I think life balances, doesn't it. Life balances out eventually. 

How's your week been? Tell me in the comments how your week's been. I'm interested to know what you've been doing. Tell me what you've been up to. Tell me what you did last weekend and tell me what you did this week. And what you're doing this weekend. I'm guna go and get ready for my evening. I'm guna...see my friend who's a producer to ask about help with aeterna and then I'm guna go and see this show and then I don't know. I've got my kids tomorrow so I'm excited about that, wana be rested and. Yeah. Y'know? Things are looking up. And I love you and thank you for all the support you've given me over the past...you guys have been a massive reason I kept going, I've told you that before but. Some. Some. Some months you guys have been the only thing that have been...have kept me going, patreon, you've been the only thing that's been keeping me going, y'know, ***financially***. **\[TN: HOLY SHIT HE LITERALLY. JUST. ADMITTED. THAT THESE PEOPLE. MEAN NOTHING TO HIM. BUT MONEY. I hope to fucking GOD that causes a final mass exodus because holy shit, imagine thinking you mean something to this man (ew) spending all your money on him (ew-er) just to be told you're literally just a dollar sign to him, lmfaoooooooo.\]** 

So I'll never forget that and you'll always be my number 1. I'll never ever forget that loyalty and that support and...I love you for it y'know. OH AND PRODUCERS OF BRIAN on the tiers here producers of brian and up, producers of brian tier and up, you'll all get a credit on the film. **\[TN: Oh gee. Thanks. I'm sure that makes up for those people spending $100 or more a month on your dumb ass.\]** Cuz it all started with Brian. This whole film. This whole new era was inspired that weird little series I made when I was high, Brian. That's where I learned that I want to make films. That's where I learned that I love storytelling. That's where I learned that I want to make a narrative based on my real life. Cuz that was heightened. Y'know...I-I think I only did three episodes, but y'know the...the...the girl that came in for the...when we did the onlyfans episode she was an actress and um. That was all heightened, y'know, obviously that's not real. And like the first episode when I'm going all paranoid and running around the house, that was all heightened, that was acted. But it was based in reality. And I was doing onlyfans around episode 2 and that's based in reality, but it's all, y'know it's all fictional. And that's where I fell in love with it and was like ""Oh I'm guna do this."" So Brian is the reason that aeterna exists so if you're a producer of brian you're a producer of aeterna. 

So.

Everyone from that level up's guna get a producer credit on the film. I don't know when the whole film's guna be finished, we're doing it in bits, the first bit is guna be shot end of this month. We're doing one day, we're doing half a day of rehearsal and then half a day of shoot. And then, the idea is that there's no edits. There's one master shot. We're guna do it in one go. And uh, I'm not an actor, so if anyone's guna eff it up, guess who it's guna be? Cuz uh the girl I'm using...the woman I'm using, sorry, is a professional actress. So she ain't guna mess it up. It's guna be me. I can't act and I break on camera and I laugh. I laugh uncontrollably and I can't stop. Um. I don't know if you ever saw the outtakes from my stuff with Laura but we used to post outtakes and I just...I just...I sometimes I cannot stop laughing. And even if it's serious, I can't stop laughing, and I know that's guna happen on this...little film. I know it is. Cuz she's hysterical already, and uh. Yeah. It's already guna be...nuts. 

So wish me luck, um. I'm finding it very hard to talk to people since I got sober. When I was uh...high, I found talking to people...only  I didn't care about people when I was high. Uh, and I found talking to them easy cuz I didn't care. Now that I care about people again, I'm finding it very difficult to talk to people. And I'm like ""Am I so weird in real life..."" I had a wobble about that over the weekend, like. There's no one like me cuz I'm so weird and I can't talk to anyone. Like I have trouble...I'm second guessing my social skills. Which I never did before, this is all new to me. And I had those disastrous dates, so I'm like...ugh. I'm like...am I...am I guna be alone forever? Maybe I will. Who knows. Maybe that's not a bad thing. I realized when I was hanging out with Alfie, ""Oh I'm fine like this."" If it was just me and Alfie 24/7 for the rest of my life, I would never feel lonely. And if was me and Poppy 24/7 for the rest of my life, I would never feel lonely. And if it was Alfie and Poppy 24/7 for the rest of my life, I would be so fulfilled and happy, I don't think...I would explode, I would just explode. 

So...yeah. As long as I'm with them I don't feel lonely. When I'm on my own, I feel lonely. and I'm second guessing my social skills and my attractiveness y'know. Everything. I'm second guessing it all cuz I'm in early sobriety and I don't know what the fuck's going on. 

Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

I've got low confidence right now. So I'm like, with this comedy show I'm like...if I go there, what if some of these comedians are super liberal and they probably will like...when I go anywhere where there's a group of people, normally a few people recognize me...no one's ever been horrible, no one's ever been horrible. But in my head, now, before when I was using I was like ""I don't give a fuck if someone's horrible, I'll just attack back, I don't give a fuck."" But now it's like, if someone's horrible to me, which they've never been, I'm guna...I'm guna...what am I guna do?

So I feel like even people that don't like me if they meet me in real life are nice. Or if they don't like me, perhaps they don't even speak to me, but everyone that's spoken to me has been nice. Watch, now I've said that, watch me tonight get gunned to death by a hater. **\[TN: 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄\]**

Oh that's my handyman texted me about the uh...leak in my roof. I wonder when he can come. Oh I feel sick now, I've eaten too much. I don't eat very much and now I've eaten...I've celebrate eated...et...celebrate ate. What? **(laughs, sighs)**

You guys I love you. Um. Let's speak...uh...I'm not...I don't post over the weekends cuz I've got my kids, but um...uh...Monday, youtube...new youtube, and uh. I'm back here. And then I post here every...every weekday mondaytuesdaywednesdaythursdayfriday, and youtube, my...in my head, the goal is...mondaywednesdayfriday. So. Go over and subscribe, you won't regret iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit. \[**TN: False. Literally every person subscribed to you will regret ever giving your content the time of day ok thanks bye.\]**

Love you. 

Bye.

1oxsm1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1oxsm1h/im_so_done_with_apps_forcing_ai_into_everything/,I’m so done with apps forcing AI into everything.,"""I’m so done with every app slapping Powered by AI on features that make my life worse.""

These and more frustrations, we see, read, and hear about every day.

If you're working on a new or existing product, whether it’s SaaS, mobile, or enterprise, and you'll use AI as a feature driver, this is for you.

Everything now is AI, from our morning coffee to the biggest decisions shaping our lives.

AI tools and hype are everywhere. And with that comes the big promises, instant wins, autonomous systems, and magic fixes.

But in reality, ""over promise, under deliver"", the new slogan of many ‘AI-first’ companies.

Raising prices, forcing AI features on users, and sparkles instead of real value.

And once you pay, nothing works as expected: AI summaries that are 40% wrong, a picture with your ex captioned “Great times with friends!”...

Those promises and excitement turn to confusion, frustration, and skepticism.

Now, you just want to get back to how the app was, disable AI features if possible, cut your subscription, or, worst-case scenario, delete the app. 

So less trust, more churn, less money.

This is what we call AI Fatigue.

So what even is AI Fatigue?

It’s that eye-roll you do when:

Gmail suggests “Great!” to a job rejection.

Amazon recommends a $400 cat tree because you bought kibble once.

These aren’t edge cases; they’re our everyday experiences. 

The pattern: AI introduces a new decision point (“Is this suggestion usable?”) faster than it removes one.

And it becomes so simple:

1. Wrap GPT-5 around a CRUD app.  
2. Rebrand as “AI-first.”  
3. Charge 3×
4. Be featured somewhere saying I built it in 2 days with 90% profit.

This works… until users realize the wrapper adds nothing.

So, how to use AI without causing fatigue:

||
||
|Solve a real pain point, not a marketing one|Ask: “Would users pay for this without the AI?” |
|Make AI invisible when possible|❌ Don’t say “Powered by AI!” every time.  ✅ Spotify’s “AI DJ” feels magical, not gimmicky.|
|Let users control and correct AI|Add: “Thumbs down, ""Don’t show AI suggestions.” |
|Be transparent about limitations|Show confidence score or “This is a suggestion” |
|Default OFF for non-essential AI|Let users opt-in.  “Summarize this email?” → Yes/No.|
|Focus on outcomes, not technology|Market the benefit, not the AI.   “Catch typos before you send” (Grammarly) |

This is not hate for AI. It’s hate for lazy, intrusive, inaccurate AI that’s everywhere now.

 Natural lighting, tested been 12-3 pm

Pics are numbered according to the below system. The bottom swatch on lips is post fading (had some coffee and taken 1 hr later)

Formula:

* Sticky Pigmented Gloss, sort of like the more luxe version of the Etude Over Glowy Tint
* Color payout: very strong, fades to a lighter lip stain
* Product feel: Initially sticky, but the stickyness goes away in about 5-7 minutes. Very nourishing on the lips.

Shades:

1. Mocha We Met: 9/10, lovely brown that fades to a nude on my lips. Great for daily wear
2. Mauve n Moist: 10/10, this was the bomb and ate tbh. The initial application gave this glossy finish that looked wine-toned on my lips. Faded to an awesome berry pink.

I honestly thought 1 would be my go-to, but 2 is soo good and surprisingly versatile.

🌿 DUMP HERE – The “My Brain Needs a Break” Thread 💚

Welcome to the chaos closet, Bloom & Chill tribe.
For ONE WEEK, this is your official place to unload the brain junk you’ve been carrying around like a broken shopping cart wheel.

✨ Someone annoyed you? Dump it.
✨ Your brain’s yelling at you at 3am? Dump it.
✨ You just need to scream into the void? Dump. It.

And just a heads up — if random strangers downvote you, that’s just Reddit being Reddit. Ignore it. This thread is here for YOU.

Now here’s your fun little science fact of the day:
Research shows that dumping your thoughts — unfiltered — helps your brain chill out, lowers stress, and frees up mental space so you can act like a functional adult again.
And if you throw in ONE tiny positive thing (even something dumb like “my coffee slapped today”), it stops your brain from slipping into a doom loop.
Totally optional — just a trick that helps.

This isn’t a complaint Olympics.
It’s a drop and go.
Brain trash → thread → freedom.

🗑️ Dump it. Leave lighter. Move on.
Thread stays open all week. If it boosts the collective sanity, we’ll make it a regular ritual.

Stay chill, stay kind, and take out your mental trash 💚🌿🗑️

**🎤 *""Ask Me Anything: K-Pop Demon Hunter Edition – Chaos, Charms & Exorcising on Stage""* 🎤**

**Hey, demon slayers, K-pop stans, and curious souls!** 👋💖

It’s your girl **Rumi**—main vocalist by day, demon hunter by night (and sometimes during soundcheck, oops 😼). You’ve seen the performances, heard the rumors, and maybe even spotted me *accidentally* summoning a minor hellspawn during a high note (long story). Now’s your chance to **ask me ANYTHING**—no topic is off-limits!

**🔮 *What’s on the table?* 🔮**
✔ **Demon hunting 101**: How do I balance exorcisms with choreo practice? (Spoiler: *lots of coffee* ☕.)

✔ **K-pop tea**: The *real* reason our last comeback had a ""haunted"" concept. (Hint: It wasn’t just aesthetics.)

✔ **Chaos confessions**: That time I turned a fan meet into an impromptu séance (the company *still* won’t let me live it down).

✔ **Fluffy tail truths**: Yes, it’s *real*. No, you can’t pull it. (Ask me how many demons have tried.)

✔ **Collab dreams**: Which artist I’d love to team up with for a demon-slaying duet? (*cough* **Stray Kids’ Han** *cough*—imagine the chaos.)

**🚨 *Rules (because even hunters need boundaries)*:**
- **No spoilers** for our next comeback (or my next exorcism target).

- **Respect the fluff**—tail jokes are encouraged, but *no* ""is it a wig"" questions. Rude.

- **Demons lurking in the comments** will be *politely* banned. (I see you, Incubus from the 3rd row of our Seoul concert.)

**💬 *Drop your Qs below!***
Whether you’re here for the music, the mayhem, or just to ask if I’ve ever *accidentally* dated a demon (…maybe), 

**I’m live for the next 4 hours**—or until I get a distress call about a possessed dance practice room. *Again.*

After speaking with dozens of small business owners like bakers, caterers, salon owners, decorators, coffee shops, home chefs and tutors, I realized something super consistent:

They’re not using Asana, Trello, or Notion.  
They’re running *everything* on **WhatsApp**.

Orders, payments, schedules, delivery updates - all in chat threads.  
It’s quick, familiar, and fits their day.

But here’s the problem they all mentioned:

“We lose track of things because everything is buried in messages.”

So I built [**TodoBuddy.ai**](https://todobuddy.ai/) \- an AI assistant that helps small business owners stay on top of their daily chaos *without leaving WhatsApp.*

You can just text naturally, like:  
💬 “Remind me to restock flour Friday.”  
💬 “Add Sarah catering order - 20 cupcakes on Tuesday.”  
💬 “Drop cake at Bob’s place - assign to David.”

TodoBuddy understands, structures, and reminds all inside WhatsApp.  
No new app. No logins. No friction.

Would love your thoughts, stories, or advice from anyone who’s built for SMBs or non-tech audiences especially if you’ve navigated similar adoption challenges.

💬 *Text. Talk. Snap. TodoBuddy remembers it all.*

I ALWAYS triple check the house number before I set the bag In front of the door. Twenty minutes I get a call from DD asking if I remember the order and told me I delivered to the wrong address. I told the DD rep that I delivered to the address in the app. She asked if I could go back get the coffee that has been sitting outside in the cold for 20 mins or so and deliver it to the proper house.

I told her I could but when I asked for the address she said she wasn’t able to give it to me . lol well how am I suppose to put it at the correct door. She finally put me on hold asked the customer if she could share the right address. I went back got the bag and took it like 4 doors down. The address was one digit different and I think she put her address in wrong yet they blamed me. And why if I messed up would they send me back to get an old coffee ? Wouldn’t they send a new driver with a fresh coffee ?

I watched for a violation to dispute but nothing has shown since yesterday. Has this happened to anyone else? I know for a fact I delivered to the address I was told.

1oxsdsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/eated/comments/1oxsdsa/hair_falling_out_chronic_fatigue_and_always/,"Hair falling out, chronic fatigue, and always freezing? Could be iron deficiency, which I wish I knew earlier about.","Yeah… so, it could be **iron deficiency** sneaking up on you.

Iron basically delivers oxygen to your cells. When it’s low, your whole body runs on “low battery mode.” That’s where the fatigue, dizziness, brittle nails, dry skin, and hair loss come from.

And tbh, a lot of women get hit harder in fall - period blood loss + less meat + drinking coffee/tea right after meals = way less iron absorbed.

# What actually helps (without just taking a pill)

* **Animal sources:** Try to eat 100-150 g of red meat (beef/veal) or chicken thighs \~3-4x a week. Add liver (\~80-100 g) once a week if you can. Fatty fish (like sardines) 2x/week helps too.
* **Plant sources:** Mix in ½ cup cooked lentils or chickpeas, 2-3 handfuls of spinach, 2 tbsp pumpkin seeds, or \~100 g tofu into your meals daily.
* **Vitamin C boost:** Pair your iron-rich meals with foods high in vitamin C (bell pepper, orange, strawberries, broccoli) - this can **double or triple** how much iron your body absorbs.

# It's also key to pair foods correctly

Iron from plant foods is absorbed worse, so it needs to be “boosted.” Good combinations include lentils with a veggie salad containing bell pepper or lemon juice, or tofu with broccoli. Meat also improves absorption of plant iron, so a plate with both animal and plant sources is the best option.

Last but not least important:

Coffee, black tea, red wine, and even cocoa reduce iron absorption due to tannins. It’s better to drink them at least an hour after meals. Calcium from milk or supplements also decreases absorption, so try not to combine dairy products with your main iron sources.

How do you deal with iron deficiency? Please share your thoughts and insights. ",2,1763215125.0,eated,0,1.0,False

1oxscfl,https://www.columbia.edu/~col8/lobsterarticle.pdf,Consider the Lobster | David Foster Wallace [and some personal thoughts on it],"I just accidentally spun what was supposed to be a simple email (re: my Sentientism book project) into this coffee-fuelled rant, so thought I'd share here too...

I finally read “Consider the Lobster” 

I think the reason I avoided the DFW piece for so long is because it’s a canonical example of the human psychological phenomenon I find most depressing. I almost prefer the more straightforward options of: 

1) Denial of sentience “they can’t feel pain”

2) Denial of harm “farming is humane”

3) “It’s tragic, but we can’t be healthy without animal products” or even…

4) The “I just don’t care, might makes right!” of the Andrew Tates and Donald Trumps of this world. 

Instead, DFW, like so many other public intellectuals, wrestles with the topic, thinks deeply about it, declares “future generations will condemn us”… but then does nothing at all. While some might read his piece and really “consider the lobster”, most will just follow his example. Arguably his performative faux-moralising (is this too harsh?) is making the situation worse, not better. The example he sets is deeply tempting, because, this way, we get to feel like we’ve really thought this thing through carefully and honestly and ethically. But then, despite our own evidence, reason and claimed compassion, we can allow yourselves simply to drift comfortably back to the prevailing social norms. They allow us, even encourage us, to carry on habitually paying for whatever we want to have done to whoever we want to have it done to. The counter-arguments, that we even made ourselves, can once again be discounted, along with PETA and the animal movement, as “extreme” or “preachy.” We might even joke about the arguments we made or the article we once wrote, as we order another lobster body at another fancy restaurant or in a tent at a festival.

DFW even hinted at the simpler, more authentic path in his article. The reason he and we worry about boiling lobsters alive is because we “consider” their perspective. But as soon as we *really* consider their perspective, we realise they don’t want to be captured or imprisoned or killed at all. Like most other sentient beings they want to live long, happy lives. If they’re social animals, they want to live long happy lives with their families or friends. Wonderfully, we have a ready alternative already chosen by millions. As DFW writes in his final footnote, “even the most diehard carniphile will acknowledge that it’s possible to live and eat well without consuming animals.” And yet, until his death, DFW continued to ignore even his own writing.",1,1763215020.0,Sentientism,0,1.0,False

Overcomplicating things with BS like memetics or praying for your random meme to go viral is just a bit hopeless

Instead maximise your chances by choosing projects who will get there through sheer will and who are actively making waves in the space.

This is why I hold **Kendu**

**Distribution**

Kendu's HHI score is 25.67, this is absolutely unheard of and is actually pretty insane levels of distribution. Diamond handers dominate the majority of the supply and they ain't selling until the tens of billions.

**Community Work Ethic**

* Over 20 IRL initiatives like energy drinks, coffee, merch, murals, beer and more
* 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, only other coin was Pepe
* Strongest community on Reddit and Stocktwits and very strong on X
* Consistently wins social media competitions for art, an example by CMC's BOOST ME COMPETITION
* Telegram activity higher than SPX, Giga and Mog over weekly periods

**Kendu** is an absolute unicorn and will change this space forever just watch, I have never seen anything remotely similar and you never will ever again!

This is your chance to get on the ground floor of a life changing project, yes it sounds far fetched but when you see the work, you see the goal...

1oxsb6j,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/lower-tariffs-bring-prices-coffee-bananas-experts-weigh/story?id=127519772,"Will lower tariffs bring down prices of coffee, bananas? Experts weigh in","The White House announced framework trade agreements with some Latin American countries in an effort to ease surging prices for grocery staples like bananas and coffee.

- The framework deals with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador will remove levies for some goods from those countries, which currently face a uniform tariff rate between 10% and 15%, a senior administration official told reporters on a background call.

- The senior administration official could not provide specifics about how much the move would reduce prices. But they did add that the White House expects ""some positive effects for prices"" on products like coffee, cocoa and bananas.

- As of September, coffee prices have spiked 18.9%, bananas have jumped 6.9% and beef prices have soared 14.7% in the past year, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed.

- Experts who spoke to ABC News indicated the lowering of tariffs could help slow or even reverse price increases for some goods such as bananas and coffee, since the U.S. does not produce those goods domestically. But, they cautioned, recent price increases for those goods owe in part to a global supply shortage, meaning tariff adjustments will have limited impact on prices.

- Beef, sourced mostly from U.S. ranchers, is expected to show minimal, if any, price change as a result of lower tariffs, since the policy targets imports, they added.

- ""Getting these tariffs off will matter to some degree but consumers shouldn't expect massive price decreases,"" Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told ABC News.

- Coffee, for instance, exemplifies the challenge posed by rising prices.

- The spike in coffee prices comes down to a dearth of supply due to extreme weather conditions alongside robust demand, meaning too many dollars are chasing after too few coffee beans, experts said.

- Trump’s tariffs have likely exacerbated those price increases, Miller said, adding that a reduction of levies could help mitigate some of the extra cost. But there’s a snag, he added: None of the countries targeted for tariff relief under the new framework deals are among the largest exporters of coffee to the U.S.

- Brazil is the top source of coffee for U.S. buyers, followed by Colombia and Vietnam; but tariffs on those countries remain unchanged.

- ""Until we hear Brazil get mentioned, I wouldn't get excited,"" Miller said.

- A drop in prices is more likely to hit bananas, some experts said. The top two exporters of U.S.-purchased bananas -- Guatemala and Ecuador -- are among the countries slated for tariff relief. Guatemala alone exports more than a quarter of the bananas eaten in the U.S, Michael Sposi, a professor of economics at Southern Methodist University, told ABC News.

- Potential cost savings from lower tariffs may get a boost from improved supply. Weather conditions and plant disease crimped banana supply worldwide earlier this year, sending prices higher. But the global price of bananas has fallen in recent months.

- In February, a metric ton of bananas peaked at an average cost of $1,250, but the price fell to $950 as of June, the most recent month on record, according to a St. Louis Federal Reserve analysis of International Monetary Fund data.

- ""Bananas are one where you can most directly point to the increase in prices we've seen in the U.S. being due to tariffs,"" Miller said. Still, he forecast the price may drop only by ""a couple of cents,"" since grocers could try to hold onto profits if shoppers keep up demand.

- Beef prices make up the largest share of a typical shopper’s costs than bananas or coffee, but the cost holds little relationship to tariffs, some experts said. U.S. ranchers account for the vast majority of beef bought in the U.S., leaving little room for tariff-induced price changes.

- ""This one is much tougher than the other categories because the others do not have a domestic industry,"" Tyler Schipper, a professor of economics at the University of St. Thomas, told ABC News.

- Schipper pointed to a shortage of cattle and potential industry-specific factors driving up beef costs, rather than tariffs.

- ""Understanding prices in that industry is different and harder than these other goods,"" Schipper said.",5,1763214929.0,Defeat_Project_2025,1,1.0,False

For example there was a time when the SSP burrs were very hyped and everybody praised them for their clarity. Then ZP6 came out and people praised it a lot as well for its extreme clarity. However when Pietro came out it seems like the general consensus switched and extreme clarity isn’t the best anymore , people started to want a bit more body in the brew. The strange thing is that many people report that the Pietro is  capable of providing more clarity (flavour separation) than the ZP6 and still be able to provide more body and texture. If I’m not wrong what provides more body is the presence of fines and boulders (assuming that we are using the same receipt while comparing grinders), so how is it possible that Pietro is able to provide more flavour separation than the ZP6 even while it has more fines (this is widely reported as well)  and more body?

All these doubts arise because I was thinking about getting a companion grinder for my C40 in order to be able to taste different profiles. If I understand it correctly the C40 is supposed to have a more blended profile where all flavours are mixed. Now the thing is that if choose the ZP6 I know it will be a sidegrade movement cause the profiles are totally different. However with the Pietro if it’s true that it has superb clarity and good body, why would I keep using the C40? Would that be a real companion grinder or simply an upgrade?

Maybe I’m wrong in many of my assumptions, so feel free to point them out 

Context: I only drink light roasts (washed, naturals, anaerobic, crazy fermented ones…). Currently with the C40 I tend to follow a 1:15 ratio with the Orea v4 narrow using 21-22 clicks and 20 gram doses. I don’t go for a higher ratio cause usually it just brings a little bit of bitterness which I totally dislike and the coffee itself is more diluted without any pros.

This woman followed and reached out to me on social. She suggested we meet for coffee, so I planned a date. We had a couple of coffee meets over a 2 month span, and I was playing it perfectly. I’m normally a sensitive emotional guy but this time I was controlling the frame, teasing her, not texting too much, kept convos light, and she was responding. Quick replies, said yes immediately to dates, laughed at all my jokes and had good body language etc. It was working.

Then some personal life stuff happened and I started getting emotional. I felt like she was wanting things to progress quicker and towards a relationship given her age and everything I was reading from her. So I told her in a couple of semi-long texts that I couldn’t give her the consistency she deserved right now and said she could go explore other things if she wants. I told her she was cute and there was a spark but that I just didn’t have time right now.

She immediately switched up. She was very nice and polite but basically took the opportunity to easily move on. I was hoping she’d say something along the lines of “I’ll be here when you’re ready to date again” or at least give me any indication of her feelings, but she accepted parting ways immediately and gave me nothing. I get the feeling I wasn’t the only guy in her life and was probably only the medium interest option. 

Now I legit have to move on completely and go no contact bc I basically told her I couldn’t move forward, while validating the hell out of her, and I just know she will not reach back out to me again. Sucks because I’m too old for this, still getting over emotional and too vulnerable too early, and I’m doing this in my 30s even though I know better.

I matched with my girlfriend around mid September this year, and we became official girlfriends in late October. I met some of her friends pretty early on, and she's met one of my closest friends thus far, and I have plans for her to meet the others (they're all employed full time so it's hard to stage meet ups lmao) before New Year if I can.

I've never dated anybody before, boy or girl (I'm bisexual), and the only examples I have are my family, of whom were all married before I was born. My friends have had... not the best relationships in the past, so I can't really use them as an example.

We're both on the same page with kids, marriage and the important things, and we're moving in a healthy and good direction.

Now. I absolutely adore my family, and I do. They mean everything to me. They're openly supportive of the LGBT community, with both of my parents having multiple friends within such, so there's no fear there beyond what's normal.

I was thinking of having my gf meet my family in an extremely casual setting, like a Costa coffee, as a first meet, so there's no real pressure. Right now is just way too hectic in my house. My family, notably my mum, is OBSESSED with Xmas, and its her fave time of the year, so I'm helping her with this right now.

I was thinking of introducing her in mid/late Jan? Around our 3 month anniversary. We would've, technically, been dating 4 and a half months, but officially together for 3.

Is 3 months a fair duration to introduce her? I do see myself with her long term, but I don't want to rock the boat too soon.  And my parents are a fabulous judge of character, so if they like her, its a win.

I hasten to add, that I do have conditions which make it a bit harder to understand social situations and normalities, which is why I'm asking for guidance.

Liver flukes are flatworms (trematodes) that invade the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder, where they feed on blood, bile, and tissue, lay eggs, excrete toxic waste, and cause long-term terrain dysfunction.
They can grow up to 3 inches long, live for 10–20 years, and often go unnoticed because they don’t always cause acute symptoms — but rather slow, progressive stagnation.

𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬:
• Fasciola hepatica – common in sheep/cattle areas; largest fluke
• Clonorchis sinensis – Chinese liver fluke; small, widespread in Asia
• Opisthorchis viverrini – prevalent in Southeast Asia; associated with bile duct cancer
• These species have unique life cycles involving snails or fish as intermediate hosts — and humans as the final host.

Liver flukes release excretory–secretory products (ESP) that suppress immune response and mimic human proteins to hide from detection — a form of molecular camouflage.

🌍 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐃𝐨 𝐏𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐝?
Liver flukes enter the body through ingestion of microscopic cysts or larvae, most commonly through:
• Raw or undercooked freshwater fish (sushi, sashimi, ceviche)
• Raw water plants (like watercress, mint, wild greens from streams)
• Contaminated water sources (wells, streams, or tap water in rural/foreign areas)
• Poor hygiene or travel to endemic regions (Asia, Middle East, Eastern Europe, South America)

Once inside, fluke larvae hatch in the intestines, burrow through the gut wall, migrate to the liver via the peritoneal cavity or bloodstream, and embed themselves in the bile ducts, where they mature and reproduce.

💧 𝟏. 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐅𝐥𝐨𝐰
They physically clog your bile ducts, like hair in a drain, preventing bile from exiting the liver and gallbladder.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬:
• Bile removes toxins, including mold, estrogen, heavy metals, pesticides
• Bile emulsifies fats and transports fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
• Bile regulates the gut microbiome (it’s antimicrobial!)
• Bile affects neurotransmitter recycling, detoxifying excess serotonin, dopamine, and histamine

𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐅𝐥𝐮𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐞:
• Toxins recirculate via enterohepatic recirculation
• Fat digestion breaks down → malnutrition despite a healthy diet
• The gut becomes a breeding ground for pathogens, candida, and parasites
• You may feel nauseated after fatty meals, and digestion slows

⚠️ Chronic bile blockage is linked to gallbladder sludge, gallstones, pancreatic stress, and increased risk of bile duct cancer.

🔥 𝟐. 𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 & 𝐈𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐞 𝐃𝐲𝐬𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
• Liver flukes irritate tissues, release toxic metabolic byproducts, and damage the bile ducts and liver cells.

𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐬:
• Chronic low-grade inflammation (especially near liver and intestines)
• Autoimmune responses via molecular mimicry
• Immune suppression — allowing other infections to thrive
• Elevated cytokines and oxidative stress

📈 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐬:
• Eosinophilia (high eosinophils)
• Mildly elevated ALT, AST, or GGT
• Histamine intolerance (flushed skin, itching, rashes)
• Leaky gut, SIBO, IBS

Liver inflammation can suppress Phase I/II detox enzymes, impairing your ability to break down toxins and drugs.

🦠 𝟑. 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐆𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐂𝐨‑𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
A liver full of flukes becomes a terrain that welcomes other invaders.

𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐝𝐞:
• Candida, H. pylori, SIBO
• Viruses (EBV, HSV, CMV, HHV‑6, HPV)
• Mycotoxins and molds
• Other parasites (roundworms, tapeworms)
• Biofilm communities that shield pathogens from herbs and drugs

This is why many chronically ill people feel worse when killing one infection — others are hiding behind the scenes.

💔 𝟒. 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐛 𝐇𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬, 𝐍𝐞𝐮𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐄𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
The liver is a central hormone regulator. When burdened, it fails to:
• Convert T4 to T3 (thyroid hormone activation)
• Break down estrogen and cortisol
• Metabolize histamine, dopamine, serotonin
• Clear insulin properly — leading to blood sugar swings

𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐭𝐨:
• PMS, PCOS, infertility
• Hypothyroidism despite normal labs
• Anxiety, panic, rage, or depression
• Sleep problems due to melatonin suppression

The liver is also tied to emotional expression — especially anger, frustration, and irritability.

⚡️ 𝟓. 𝐇𝐢𝐣𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐄𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐲 & 𝐌𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐚
Liver flukes drain your body’s resources and poison the energy factories (mitochondria).

𝐇𝐨𝐰:
• Steal vital nutrients like B vitamins, amino acids, iron, and copper
• Disrupt oxygen use and ATP synthesis
• Block mitochondrial detox (via excess calcium, aldehydes, and ammonia)
• Impair methylation, glutathione, and sulfur pathways

𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐬:
• Chronic fatigue
• Dizziness and post‑meal crashes
• Cold hands/feet
• Poor recovery from stress or exercise
• Mitochondrial bottlenecks on OAT tests

🧪 𝐒𝐲𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐥𝐮𝐤𝐞𝐬 (𝐎𝐟𝐭𝐞𝐧 𝐌𝐢𝐬𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠𝐧𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝)
• Digestive distress, especially after fats
• Upper right abdominal pressure or pain
• Itchy skin, eczema, psoriasis, rashes
• Eye floaters, visual blurring
• Nausea, burping, sulfur smell
• Brain fog, forgetfulness, irritability
• Pale or floating stools, undigested fat
• Gallbladder attacks or “phantom” gallbladder pain (even post‑removal)
• Multiple food intolerances and reactions

🔬 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Liver flukes are masters of disguise — conventional labs miss them unless specifically ordered.

𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
• GI‑MAP: May detect Clonorchis, Fasciola, or Opisthorchis
• O&P stool tests: Best with 3 samples across different days
• HTMA: Reveals bile stagnation patterns (high calcium/copper, low sodium/potassium)
• Liver function tests: ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, bilirubin
• Eosinophils: Elevated on CBC
• Functional patterns: Persistent estrogen dominance, histamine overload, or post‑gallbladder symptoms.

The goal isn’t just to eliminate the parasite — it’s to restore flow, repair damage, and rewire the terrain that allowed the fluke to take hold in the first place.

✅ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟏: 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐃𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 (𝐁𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐨𝐱 𝐁𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐬)
Liver flukes release toxins, inflammatory proteins, metabolic waste, and eggs as they die. If your detox organs are blocked, this toxic debris will re-enter your bloodstream and overwhelm your system — causing rashes, anxiety, fatigue, or severe flare-ups.
So before starting any elimination phase, it’s crucial to support and open the body’s drainage pathways:

🧴 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫 & 𝐆𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐛𝐥𝐚𝐝𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐥𝐨𝐰
• Castor oil packs (applied over liver 3–5x/week): open stuck bile ducts, reduce inflammation, and gently soften fluke debris
• Bitter herbs like dandelion, gentian, artichoke, and beet root: stimulate bile production, cleanse the liver, thin sluggish bile
• Lemon water with a pinch of sea salt: hydrates and alkalizes, gently encourages bile release in the morning

💧 𝐊𝐢𝐝𝐧𝐞𝐲 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭
• Hydration is non-negotiable: aim for half your body weight in ounces of clean, filtered water
• Nettle tea, cleavers, and cranberry leaf: support filtration, reduce inflammation, and help flush parasite toxins
• Electrolytes (magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonate): help regulate fluid balance, support adrenal function, and prevent dehydration from binder use

🌊 𝐋𝐲𝐦𝐩𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭
• Rebounding (mini trampoline): 5–10 minutes daily helps push lymph fluid through congested terrain
• Dry brushing: supports lymph drainage toward major exit points (use circular strokes toward the heart)
• Lymphatic massage or gua sha (neck and clavicle area): encourages toxin exit through thoracic ducts

🚽 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲
• Magnesium citrate or oxide: draws water into the colon, helps move out dead parasites and waste
• Enemas (coffee or plain warm water): assist with toxic dump after fluke die-off, especially if constipation is present
• Prune tea, triphala, aloe vera juice: natural stool softeners and gut tonics to prevent sluggish elimination

⚠️ If bile, bowels, or kidneys aren’t flowing, toxins and fluke debris will reabsorb — leading to stronger reactions, skin flare-ups, mood crashes, and stagnation.
𝐃𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐨. 𝐃𝐨 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐬𝐤𝐢𝐩.

✅ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟐: 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐥𝐮𝐤𝐞 𝐊𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐏𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐞 (𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐥)
Once your organs of elimination are open and supported, begin a strategic anti-parasitic protocol focused on liver flukes and their eggs. This is not a one-size-fits-all supplement approach — it’s a layered attack against the adult worms, larvae, and biofilms they hide within.

🌿 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐧𝐭𝐢-𝐅𝐥𝐮𝐤𝐞 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐛𝐬
Each herb has a different mechanism of action:
• Mimosa pudica seed – a gelatinous binder that physically grabs parasites, eggs, and biofilms; best taken on an empty stomach
• Black walnut hull – antifungal, antiparasitic, works well with mimosa and clove to weaken adult worms
• Wormwood – neurotoxic to parasites; enhances bile flow and weakens fluke defenses
• Clove – kills fluke eggs (essential to prevent re-infestation)
• Myrrh – powerful anti-parasitic and bile duct cleanser
• Neem, garlic, barberry – antimicrobial herbs that support gut terrain and help clear secondary infections (candida, H. pylori)
• Berberine – antimicrobial and biofilm disruptor; helpful for co-existing SIBO
• Artemisinin – from sweet wormwood, targets malaria and flukes using a ferroptosis (iron-based kill) mechanism

Rotate herbs every few weeks to avoid resistance and adapt to the fluke life cycle.

🔧 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐅𝐥𝐮𝐤𝐞-𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬
• Castor oil internally (with practitioner support) – stimulates bile purge and mechanical expulsion of flukes
• Serrapeptase or lumbrokinase – enzymes that break down biofilms, dissolve scar tissue and cysts where flukes hide

𝐁𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬:
• Activated charcoal – general toxin sponge
• Zeolite – heavy metal and ammonia binding
• Fulvic/humic acid – broad-spectrum terrain binder
• Bentonite clay – physically binds debris and endotoxins

𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐬:
• Milk thistle – restores glutathione and protects hepatocytes
• NAC – precursor to glutathione, neutralizes fluke toxins
• Glycine – calming amino acid that helps bile conjugation
• Liposomal glutathione – advanced cellular protection

🧰 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬
• Coffee enemas – stimulate bile dump and phase II liver detox, especially effective after a night of heavy die-off
• Infrared sauna or sweating – opens skin as an emergency detox route
• Rife machines, zappers, PEMF devices – use frequency to break parasite structures (best as supportive tools)
• Castor oil purge protocol – can be done in short bursts to expel flukes (requires strong drainage and experienced guidance)

✅ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟑: 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐂𝐲𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐬 (𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐲𝐜𝐥𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞)
Liver flukes have complex, multi-phase lifecycles. They lay eggs in cycles, and those eggs can hatch later, even after the adult worm is gone.
A one-time cleanse is not enough.

𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐲𝐜𝐥𝐞:
• Elimination Phase: 2–4 weeks of herbals + binders
• Rest Phase: 1–2 weeks of drainage, replenishment, mitochondrial and nervous system support

Repeat this cycle at least 3–6 times — more if:
• Your terrain is chronically stagnant
• You’ve had long-term or repeated exposures (travel, fish consumption, water exposure)
• You have co-infections, heavy metals, or mold

Some cases require 6–12 months of intelligent cycling to fully remove all generations of the flukes and their eggs

✅ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟒: 𝐑𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧 (𝐀𝐟𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐊𝐢𝐥𝐥)
Once the flukes are purged, you’re not done. The terrain they damaged must be re-mineralized, re-nourished, and rewired.

𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫 + 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐍𝐮𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬
• Choline, taurine, lecithin, SAMe – critical for bile production, methylation, and hormone clearance
• Glycine – supports phase II liver detox and neurotransmitter calm

𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬 & 𝐅𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐬
• Bitter greens (arugula, dandelion, endive)
• Beets and radishes (thin bile, support flow)
• Carrot salads with olive oil + ACV (estrogen detox)
• Dandelion tea and lemon water

𝐌𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
• CoQ10 and PQQ – restore electron transport chain efficiency
• B-complex – especially B1 (thiamine) and B6 (P5P)
• Carnitine – transports fats into mitochondria for energy
• Glutathione – reduces oxidative damage

𝐄𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐬
• Magnesium – relaxes bile ducts, aids sleep and nerve function
• Potassium and sodium – adrenal and fluid balance
• Copper and boron – critical for collagen repair, energy flow, and parasite resistance

𝐀𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐱𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐬 & 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐫 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬
• Vitamin C, A, E, and selenium – help mop up oxidative fluke damage
• Collagen, slippery elm, marshmallow – rebuild gut lining and soothe inflamed terrain
• Probiotics and SBOs – recolonize terrain after parasite removal

Overcomplicating things with BS like memetics or praying for your random meme to go viral is just a bit hopeless

Instead maximise your chances by choosing projects who will get there through sheer will and who are actively making waves in the space.

This is why I hold **Kendu**

**Distribution**

Kendu's HHI score is 25.67, this is absolutely unheard of and is actually pretty insane levels of distribution. Diamond handers dominate the majority of the supply and they ain't selling until the tens of billions.

**Community Work Ethic**

* Over 20 IRL initiatives like energy drinks, coffee, merch, murals, beer and more
* 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, only other coin was Pepe
* Strongest community on Reddit and Stocktwits and very strong on X
* Consistently wins social media competitions for art, an example by CMC's BOOST ME COMPETITION 
* Telegram activity higher than SPX, Giga and Mog over weekly periods

**Kendu** is an absolute unicorn and will change this space forever just watch, I have never seen anything remotely similar and you never will ever again!

This is your chance to get on the ground floor of a life changing project, yes it sounds far fetched but when you see the work, you see the goal...

Most people have no idea what they’re missing.

Okay hear me out.

Caffeine is a **neuroactive drug** and a damn potent one. But most of us are so used to it that we literally *need* it just to function like a normal human in the morning. Not to thrive, not to unlock our brain’s potential just to *get to baseline*. That’s wild when you think about it.

I used to be like that too. Morning coffee? Non-negotiable. Couldn’t think, couldn’t talk, definitely couldn’t work without it. But eventually I realized… I wasn’t *feeling* it anymore. It was just using it to feel “normal.” No boost. No spark. Just maintenance. Like a sad little brain on autopilot.

So I quit daily coffee. And honestly? Best decision ever. These days, my go-to drink is **classic tea with cream**. It tastes better to me anyway, and the lower caffeine levels mean my body stays **sensitive** to stimulants.

Now when I actually *do* drink coffee like for exams, deadlines, or emergency crunch time it’s like flipping a switch.

No joke: everything gets sharper. My brain goes quiet. The room feels like it fades away. I’m locked in. Absorbing information faster, thinking more clearly. It’s not some mild “Oh hey I’m awake now” feeling it hits me like a truck (in a good way).  
Almost like that movie *Limitless*.

And here's the thing most people will never feel that, because they’re chugging coffee *every single day* just to feel alive enough to check their emails. They’re totally caffeine-resistant. So they’ll read this and go “Yeah okay bro, you just like tea.”

But they’re missing the point. Coffee *can* be insanely powerful if you treat it like a tool, not a crutch.

So yeah, I treat coffee like a **performance enhancer**. Something I only use when I actually need to be in high gear. And because I don’t abuse it daily, it still works *like magic* when I need it to.

Try going off it for a bit and saving it for the days that matter. You might be surprised what it can actually do for your brain.",1,1763214503.0,getdisciplined,2,0.67,False

1oxs3bi,https://i.redd.it/w88wavzgdf1g1.jpeg,Many Scenes in the series have hidden landscape maps,"If you watch greed and gold and behind the scenes, you will find out that they all rented a cabin for the filming. 

I believe Justin is either showing the equator line or horizon line by opening the windows in Cynthia scenes and the room scene. If you watch the Benjamin Wallace scene he coming down the steps after being in this computer room. You will notice the deer horn, where mom had her first hunting experience. The number of books stacked from 7 to 6. In Cynthia scene it has the Horse stuffed animal one one side of the the couch, both windows opened the same amount to line up with the buffalo blanket and arrows going one way and then another..( similar to the poem, travel one way then return her face to find this place. On the other side of the couch is a green coffee mug and what I am assuming to be forest fenn treasure and the blaze tree. Or it could be grandpa cabin and the Christmas tree he would cut down for them to ship to Arizona. 

The point is most scenes are laid out as landmark map. The lawyers deck, the phone with numbers has in the beginning of Cynthia scene isn’t a traditional for film. It is the date of the start of the Korean War, also the book hanging slanted in the library is tied to Korea. Justin talks about wearing his grandfather Purple Heart, and uniform when he was a kid and reflected on that at his grandfathers memorial when he was recognized for his service. He described his grandfather clinches jaw the same way he described Brandon’s in the beginning of the book when they are in west Yellowstone.

Most of the scenes he has his grandfathers picture, I believe this all tied heavily on the treasure location. 

Rewatch the documentary, make a map based on the book picture and information and try to follow the directional clues in order to map out where the treasure is. For most of Justin’s he uses the B Penn to point for directions, blue color to mark the “blue ribbon” blaze to find the treasure mark and figure out where he is hinting the treasure can be found. 

I have gathered so many clues from the documentary to try to pin point a certain area and then use google maps to line some of the clues from the poem and backstories from the book to figure out the meaning in the poem and pin point a location. 

2 observations pulled from old Justin’s any seek videos:

1. Justin always search “wilderness areas”

2. Always made a one mile marker around the campground.

3. Hidden in plain site: Justin described quake lake area with old abandoned campground and a see of blazes on the tree’s. He always like the idea of hidden in plain site

4. When mentioned his treasure hunt to Matt demoss in Amy seeks videos. Matt was surprised and Justin said “I’ve had a place picked out for while, I use to hide treasure and invite my friends over to find it.” Which makes me believe he had some sort of idea for a long time during these games and thought to himself “if I ever hide a treasure this is where it would be”.

Light reference:

1. Strongly indicate rainbows at the 42 degree angle

2. Lighthouse - is a guide to help ships in

Blue references:

1. Wearing blue all scenes
2. Computer line is blue
3. Ribbon is blue on the tree in kirwin
4. Blue - (Christmas Songs) blue Christmas 
5. Blue - (the size of a football field he mentions in the documentary) I think of Blue 42, hut hut, hike in football. 

I know this is a bunch of random information but I doubt I will ever be able to actually get BOTG, or at least not till next summer so I just thought I’d share in case someone didn’t see certain clues that I noticed or maybe they don’t mean anything but if it helps with anyone’s solves and is helpful then it’s for you!

I want good coffee, easy to use machine (I don’t plan on weighing my coffee etc) and a reliable one.

I’m stuck between DeLonghi La Specialista Arte (now on sale for 377€) and Sage Barista Express (SES875) (501€ on sale).

Chapter 1 Regret After Betrayal


""Sweetheart, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's health is getting worse. You're our only daughter. Don't you want to come home and take over the company?""

In the quiet room, Demi Snow held a paintbrush while listening to her mother's worn voice on the phone.

The dim light cast a soft glow over her canvas as she drew the final stroke of a family of three.

Carol Snow thought this was another failed attempt. But unexpectedly, Demi spoke softly, ""Okay.""

Carol froze for a moment, surprised. ""Y-you agreed?""

""Yes,"" Demi said calmly. ""I'll come home. I just need some time to finish things here. I'll be home within two weeks.""

After exchanging a few more words, Demi ended the call.

She walked out of her studio and looked down from the staircase into the living room. Three people sat there.

Her gaze lingered on the man sitting on the couch.

He had sharp, handsome features—deep-set eyes, clean lines, and a quiet, serious aura. His shirt was buttoned all the way up, his dress pants crisp and perfect. Everything about him screamed control and elegance.

That was her husband, Nevin Blackwell, the man she had chosen against her family's wishes. She once believed Nevin was worth giving up everything for.

Nevin was known for his cold, distant manner. People in his circle called him the Ice Prince. But right now, he was smiling softly at another woman.

Nearby, a six-year-old boy with bright eyes ran into the woman's arms. ""Rhea, can you make me some orange-glazed fish? Please?""

Rhea Dunn touched his nose affectionately and smiled. ""Of course, cupcake.""

Orion Blackwell's eyes lit up with joy. ""You're the best! You're different than my mom; she never lets me eat what I want.""

He pouted after saying that.

Rhea smiled and said gently, ""Then you should eat a little more today.""

Orion nodded, his face bright with a sweet grin. ""Rhea, you're so nice. I wish you were my real mom.""

Rhea's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Demi's heart ached painfully.

She knew Orion could get greedy with food. Demi limited his portions because she didn't want his stomach to hurt later.

But watching them now—her husband, her son, and that woman—they looked like a real family. She was the one left out.

Demi went back to her room.

A few minutes later, footsteps sounded outside.

The door opened. Rhea walked in, her makeup flawless, her expression soft and gentle. ""Demi,"" she said sweetly, ""let's go downstairs and celebrate Orion's birthday together.""

Rhea used to be her intern. She'd come from a poor family and had just enough skill to get by. Demi still remembered the day Rhea broke down in her office, crying that if she couldn't find a job soon, she'd have to marry some guy back home.

Demi had taken pity on her and brought her into the company.

Who could've guessed she'd end up inviting a snake into her home?

Rhea copied everything Demi did—her style, her voice, and even how she spoke to Nevin. By the time Demi realized it, Rhea was already part of their home, close to both her husband and her son.

Demi had long seen through her act. She hated herself for letting a snake into the house.

""I'm not feeling well,"" she said coldly. ""I'll pass.""

Rhea put on her best innocent act. ""Demi, you're his mom. Orion needs your blessing today.""

Demi frowned, ready to refuse again, but then stopped. She sighed.

This is between me and Rhea. Orion shouldn't suffer because of it.

As his mother, I owe him my presence on his birthday.

Demi put down her paintbrush, brushed past Rhea, and headed downstairs.

For a second, Rhea's smile stiffened. A flash of malice crossed her eyes before she followed.

When Demi saw Nevin and Orion together, she froze.

Ten years ago, she joined Blackwell Group to gain experience and met Nevin there. They fought, laughed, and somehow fell in love. Against her family's wishes, she married him. Demi even cut ties with them because of it.

For the past decade, Demi never once regretted her choice. She had a rich, handsome husband who treated her well and a smart, adorable child.

She thought her life was perfect until Rhea showed up.

Demi watched as Rhea smiled sweetly, serving food for Nevin and Orion.

Rhea's arrival had shattered everything that once felt beautiful.

Demi picked up her fork, ready to eat, but suddenly felt a wave of nausea.

She set it down quickly and ran to the restroom, retching over the sink.

Nevin looked worried and started to follow her, but Rhea stopped him. Her eyes filled with concern.

""Mr. Blackwell, what's wrong with Demi?"" she asked anxiously.

Nevin comforted gently. ""She's been doing this lately. It's nothing; don't worry.""

Then he turned toward the restroom and mocked coldly, ""What's your excuse this time? Did you catch a cold? Or is the food not good enough again?""

Demi said nothing. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue.

If she told them she was pregnant, would anyone believe her?

Forget it. She was already planning to leave. Why should she tell them?

There's no point in ruining the sweet moment between her husband and that homewrecker.

Rhea was a secretary, but she had the nerve to scold her boss. ""Mr. Blackwell, don't talk like that. Maybe she really doesn't feel well. She's lost so much weight lately.""

She stood up, poured a cup of hot tea, and handed it to Demi.

""Are you okay? Here, drink some tea.""

The sight of her disgusting face made Demi feel even sicker. Irritated, she pushed her hand away.

She hadn't used much force, but Rhea stumbled slightly. Somehow, the water spilled on Rhea's hand.

""Ouch!"" Rhea cried out in pain.

""Rhea!""

""Rhea!""

Nevin and Orion rushed over at the same time. The father and son stared at Rhea's red, scalded hand with panic and concern.

Her fair skin had turned bright red from the burn.

Tears filled Orion's eyes as he looked at Rhea. ""Does it hurt a lot?"" The boy asked softly, his voice trembling with worry.

Rhea forced a smile, pretending to be strong. ""It's okay, Orion. I wasn't careful. It doesn't hurt.""

Nevin turned toward Demi, his eyes burning with anger.

His voice was cold as ice. ""What trouble are you trying to cause this time?""

Demi's heart twisted in pain. She caught Rhea's smug look, then saw her son standing protectively in front of her. Hopelessness washed over her, and she closed her eyes.

""I didn't do anything,"" she said quietly.

But of course, Nevin didn't believe her.

When the family doctor arrived, Nevin helped Rhea sit up, letting her lean against his chest. His dark eyes were filled with disappointment.

""Demi, you've changed. The woman I knew would never do something like this out of jealousy.""

Changed?

Yes. She had changed.

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had a stomach full of stretch marks from giving birth. She wouldn't have dull skin from sleepless nights.

And she wouldn't have given up her career to cook and clean for a man, only to be replaced by someone new.

Demi suddenly felt exhausted. She swallowed her explanation and went upstairs.

Before entering her room, she looked back one last time. The living room was chaos, but in the middle of it stood her husband and son, both surrounding Rhea with concern, like a perfect little family.

Demi smiled bitterly and shook her head. Gently, she placed a hand on her stomach and set a countdown to her departure on her phone.

Then she walked into her room without hesitation.

From that moment on, she promised herself she would never disturb them again.            


Chapter 2 I'm Done Playing This Ridiculous Game


The noise outside slowly faded away. Demi didn't care what was going on. She just put on her earplugs and eye mask and slept until morning.

She'd decided to go home and took over the family business. That meant she had to quit her job here.

Since giving birth to Orion, she had rarely appeared at the company. But back when Nevin took over the Blackwell Group, she was right there beside him, helping build everything step by step.

Blackwell Group wouldn't have become the country's top firm without her.

So even though she hadn't worked in the office for years, she still received a large annual bonus and dividends.

Early that morning, Demi stared at her reflection in the mirror. Her long wavy brown hair framed a delicate face, but her pretty charming eyes carried no trace of a smile.

She was beautiful. No one could deny that. Even after years as a stay-at-home wife, all the exhaustion and stress hadn't taken away her charm.

But the emotional abuse at home and the stress of pregnancy had drained the light from her eyes, making them look lifeless and dull now.

At the top floor of Blackwell Group, Demi was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Behind her, she overheard a few employees chatting.

""Did you see Rhea's Instagram?""

""Not yet. What did she post this time?""

""Plenty. Looks like she was celebrating someone's birthday. You've got to see it.""

They laughed, but when they looked up and saw Demi standing there, their smiles froze.

""Uh—M-Ms. Snow?""

""Ms. Snow, you're back at the office?""

Demi gave them a polite nod. They quickly murmured a goodbye and rushed off.

As they disappeared down the hall, she could still hear them whispering.

""Ugh, what bad luck. Why's Demi here?""

""She's already married Mr. Blackwell. Why show off in front of us?""

""Please, I bet she and Mr. Blackwell aren't doing great. Wouldn't be surprised if they're getting divorced.""

Demi wasn't bothered with this. She was used to this kind of talk. Her coworkers had never liked her much.

If it hadn't been for all the office bullying she faced early on and Nevin stepping in to help, she probably would've never fallen for him.

Bored from waiting, she unlocked her phone and opened Instagram.

The first thing she saw was Rhea's new post. A collage of nine pictures.

The first one was from Orion's birthday party last night, lavishly decorated with balloons and a huge three-layer cake right in the center.

But what caught Demi's eye was a hospital photo. Three hands of different sizes stacked together. It looked warm and cozy.

A trip to the hospital again? Just for a burn?

Demi let out a dry laugh and scrolled through the comments. They were all full of envy and well wishes.

[Wow! A birthday party for the little one? So sweet!]

[Another lovey-dovey post! Who's your mystery man, girl? Show us already]

[Doesn't matter what happens—as long as the family's together, that's happiness.]

The comments went on and on.

She knew exactly what Rhea was doing. Rhea was trying to get under her skin, trying to make her lose control, run to Nevin, and demand answers.

Once upon a time, that would've worked. She couldn't stand seeing that fake sweetness or how her husband and son would rather be with a woman who copied her every move.

But now? She was leaving soon. None of it mattered anymore.

Demi let out a faint smile and tapped the little red heart beneath the post.

A moment later, with her resignation letter in hand, Demi went straight to the CEO's office and handed it to Nevin's personal assistant.

The people in the secretary department were whispering behind her back, mocking her for showing off at the office as if she owned the place. But the moment they saw the resignation letter, the room went silent. Then someone gasped.

""""What—wait, am I seeing this right?!""

""Ms. Snow is resigning?!""

The assistant froze, panic flashing across her face. ""Mr. Blackwell is in an important meeting. Maybe we should wait until he's done—""

""Don't bother,"" Demi said with a calm smile. ""I'm just the chief of secretary in name only, remember? You have the authority to process it. No need to trouble him.""

People around whispered in low voices. ""Could the rumors be true? Did Demi and Mr. Blackwell break up? Is Ms. Dunn turning out to be a homewrecker?""

""Why did you assume it's Ms. Dunn? Isn't she married?""

""You're clueless. Did you see that hand on Instagram? That Rolex costs a fortune. No one in all of Yraka could afford it except Mr. Blackwell.""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice that Ms. Dunn took over all Ms. Snow's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""And now that she's quitting, maybe it's because she's stepping aside for good!""

Demi could hear every word of it. They'd always loved gossiping. In the past, she would've been crushed, hiding under the covers and crying into her pillow.

But now? She suddenly realized none of it mattered anymore.

She smiled at everyone as if she hadn't heard a thing, bowed politely, and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work over the past ten years. I hope Blackwell Group continues to grow and thrive.""

The office fell silent. No one knew what to say. Demi walked back to her desk and began packing up her things.

After ten years, her workspace was filled to the brim. Ten years' worth of memories were stacked neatly in front of her—books she bought when she first joined, binders filled with notes, and her old planner from when she became Nevin's secretary.

Flipping it open, she saw her handwriting still crisp and clear.

""1. He drinks a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning.""

""2. He hates people being late.""

""3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.""

Page after page was filled with small details about him—his habits, his preferences, and his temper. Every line represented her dedication.

Only God knew what Demi had gone through to be a good secretary. People always thought being a secretary was easy, that it just meant being pretty and pleasing a man with their body. They had no idea how wrong they were.

Nevin was the only one who'd ever seen the truth. He'd seen her stay late night after night, reading contracts until her eyes hurt, building presentations from scratch, and researching every single competitor the company ever had. She could list every company's data and performance by heart.

It was because of her relentless effort that the untouchable Ice Prince of the Blackwell family finally stepped down from his pedestal and became the man everyone admired today.

Demi once believed Nevin understood her better than anyone else in the world. She thought their bond went deeper than love, that they shared the same dream, the same fight. She was wrong.

Ten years of devotion, ten years of struggle and love—all of it had turned into nothing but ashes.

Demi quietly focused on cleaning up her desk when the meeting ended. Rhea was the first to step out.

She looked quite cheerful at first, but the moment she saw Demi, her smile froze.

What is she doing here?

Did Demi see the post on Instagram? Is she here to confront me?

Rhea grew excited just thinking about it. She couldn't sit still as she went back to her desk, waiting nervously for the storm to hit.

She lowered her head, eyes red, looking like she'd just been terribly wronged.

Nevin was the last to leave the conference room. As he passed the secretary department, he noticed Demi sitting there.

Her desk was the closest to his office—a symbol of trust and affection back in the days when they were still in love.

But now, just the sight of her made him irritated.

What made it worse was how cheerful she looked. Demi was flipping through a book with a small smile on her face.

Across from her, Rhea sat miserably, dabbing her tears with a tissue.

Nevin frowned.

He tapped the edge of Demi's desk and said coldly, ""Come in.""

Demi looked up, her expression composed. ""Okay,"" she replied simply.

The moment she stepped into his office, his voice turned icy.

""The company doesn't need you here anymore. Unless there's something important, don't show up in the office again.""            


Chapter 3 I Quit, Mr. Blackwell


Demi froze. No matter how many times Nevin had disappointed her, his cold voice still pierced her heart like a needle.

Her smile faded. ""Alright,"" she said quietly, eyes downcast.

Nevin had expected Demi to fight back, maybe even yell. But her calm obedience caught him off guard. For the first time, he really looked at her.

Rhea was right. Demi had lost a lot of weight lately.

Maybe her nausea last night wasn't a jealous act after all.

Nevin pressed his lips together, his tone softening a little. ""Ms. Dunn is doing great at her job. Your only duty now is to take care of Orion.""

Then his voice turned sharp again. ""I've told you many times—there's nothing going on between me and her. Demi, stop being dramatic. Don't make me regret choosing you as my wife.""

Regret?

She smiled bitterly. If anyone regretted it, it was her. She had given up her family business and traded it for this hollow title as his wife.

Demi came from a prestigious family. Wouldn't it be better to go back and live as the beloved heiress of the Snow Group, adored and protected by everyone?

Closing her eyes, Demi pulled out an envelope and handed it to him. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Blackwell, please approve my resignation. Starting tomorrow, I'll officially leave the company.""

She turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, Nevin grabbed her arm.

""Demi?""

His voice carried surprise, as if he hadn't processed what just happened.

Nevin glanced down at the resignation letter in his hand, her signature printed clearly in black ink. His face darkened, anger flickering in his eyes.

""You're doing this out of spite?"" he demanded.

""I thought you came here to make peace, but you're just making it worse?""

Demi kept her gaze low, her long lashes trembling slightly.

""No, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said calmly. ""You said the company doesn't need me. Turns out, I feel the same way.""

""Ten years have passed. This company isn't what it used to be,"" Demi said calmly. ""Since everyone seems to adore Ms. Dunn, there's no point in me sitting around collecting a paycheck. I'd rather step down and make room for her.""

Nevin let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp as blades, cutting straight through her words.

""Don't use these ten years to guilt-trip me. I know how much you've done for this company. You were a good employee once. But Demi, ever since you gave birth, you haven't been involved in business at all. I've been patient with you.""

He leaned closer, his tone low and dismissive. ""As long as you take care of our child, you'll always be the lady of the household. That's all I've ever asked, but you couldn't even manage that.""

Nevin's voice grew harsher. ""And now you want to step down gracefully? You just want to throw Rhea into the spotlight and make her take the blame. Demi, I know you too well. You're full of scheme, but I'm warning you don't be so vicious.""

He paused, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Have you even apologized to Rhea for the incident happened last night?""

Apologize?

To the homewrecker destroyed my family?

Shouldn't Rhea be the one who owed me a thank you?

Demi suddenly laughed, the sound soft but cutting. She tilted her head, looking at him with calm curiosity. ""You're right. I'm vicious. But tell me, Mr. Blackwell, have you ever thought about giving up the appearance?""

By giving up meant divorce.

They'd fought about it many times over the years. Every argument ended the same way—no resolution, just silence.

Nevin would never agree. Even if he cheated, Demi was still his wife.

That was the kind of man Nevin was—controlling, arrogant, and born to dominate.

At first, Demi didn't really want to leave. She just wanted him to look at her again, to remember she was there.

But now, she was tired.

A clean break, each walked their own ways.

Each of them had a child. That didn't sound so bad anymore.

Nevin's expression darkened like a storm. He grabbed her arm so hard it hurt, his grip full of rage.

""This is your last chance, Demi. If you keep failing, I'll have to find Orion a new mother.""

He didn't stop there. ""Do you know how many times Orion's told me he's miserable with you? No fun. No freedom. Nothing.""

His voice turned to ice. ""Why do you fail at everything—as a wife and as a mother?""

Failure.

Demi closed her eyes and let out a long, shaky breath.

So that's how it was.

All those nights she stayed up waiting for him, making him warm lemon tea after his drinking session was a failure.

The times she hand-washed his couture suits and got frostbite in the dead of winter—failure.

Even teaching their son advanced math to meet the high standards of being a heir of the Blackwells—still a failure.

There was no place left for her in this house.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said quietly.

Her tone was calm, sincere.

A loser should know when to take her final bow.

Her other hand slipped into her pocket. She opened her phone and tapped the screen.

A countdown started—another 14 days to go.

When it hit zero, she would be gone. Completely. No more arguments, no more tears, no more bothering Nevin with her existence.

Her calmness caught him off guard.

Nevin wanted to say something—anything—but Demi didn't give him the chance.

She walked away resolutely. Nevin reached out to stop her, but his hand closed on nothing but air.

A sharp pain clenched his chest as he watched her go, a strange panic building inside him.

Nevin frowned, watching Demi walk away. It felt like something important, something he couldn't name was slipping further and further from him.

Once she stepped outside, Demi pulled out her phone and made a call to her best friend, Phoebe Lennon.

They used to be best friends, but they hadn't spoken in seven years.

Phoebe was a fashion designer who practically lived on airplanes, traveling across the country to tailor clothes for models.

Some were male, some female. Well, things sometimes happened between adults who worked that closely.

To put it simply, Phoebe changed boyfriends as easily as changing outfits. Nevin couldn't stand that about her. After Demi gave birth to Orion, he told her to stay away from Phoebe, worried she'd be a bad influence and corrupted their son.

And Demi listened. She actually listened. For six whole years, she cut off her oldest friend, just because her husband said so.

It had been a long time since Phoebe last heard from Demi. The moment she picked up, her voice was sharp with anger. ""So you finally remembered me! I thought you'd completely lost your mind over that man. What happened? Regret finally hit you?""

Demi couldn't help but laugh through her tears.

Nevin's insults hadn't made her cry. Rhea's tricks hadn't made her cry. Even watching her son calling another woman mother hadn't broken her.

But hearing Phoebe's voice did. For the first time, she cried from regret.

""Yes,"" she admitted. ""I regret it. Phoebe, Is it too late to come back to you now?""

Hearing Demi's sincere voice, there was a long pause on the other end. When Phoebe finally spoke again, her voice was trembling with tears too.

""It's never too late. You finally came to your senses. You idiot, do you know how hard it's been running the studio without you all these years?""

Her tone turned fierce again, full of emotion. ""The entire art world's been waiting for you! Demi, being a corporate secretary is a waste of your gift. You were born to hold a brush—you're the greatest painter of our time, the last jewel of the Impressionists. I've been waiting for you.""

""I'm sorry, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.""

Standing on the busy street, Demi crouched down and sobbed.

She should've never forgotten who she was. She used to be so proud.

Born gifted, brilliant, and proud—Nevin never even knew that Demi had studied fine arts overseas.

Her graduation piece had been selected for the Janbus International Art Exhibition, shocking the art world.

After that, her paintings sold for seven-figure prices at auction.

And yet, she'd walked away from all of it. For the sake of living experience, she had taken a regular office job, learned administration, finance, and management and still excelled.

After ten long years away from her canvas, she decided she was done hiding. She was going home—to art, to herself.             


Chapter 4 I'm Done with This Ungrateful Brat


After setting a date with Phoebe to hand over the studio, Demi went home.

She gave herself two weeks. Ten years was such a long time. There were too many loose ends to tie up before she could walk away for good.

The biggest issue at hand was the household itself.

The huge 5,000-square-foot villa didn't have a single helper because Nevin complained they were noisy.

So, Demi handled every bit of cleaning herself.

If she was going to leave, she wanted to do it gracefully—like a professional, like the perfect secretary she'd always been. That was her pride as the heiress of the Snows.

Rhea, of course, wasn't the type to do chores. Demi decided to find a good maid for her husband and son.

All day, she interviewed candidates. She asked them to cook soups the way Nevin liked them. That night, while Demi was having dinner, a panicked shout came from the door.

""Bill! Call the family doctor—now!""

It was Nevin's voice.

Demi froze. Being pregnant, the faint smell of blood made her sick.

Her heart twisted with worry.

What happened? Is he hurt?

She hurried toward the entrance—only to see Nevin rushing in, carrying a woman in his arms. Snow was falling outside, clinging to his hair and coat, but he didn't seem to notice.

Nevin laid the woman on the couch, voice tight with anger. ""Where is the doctor? Get the doctor here, now!""

Demi didn't even have to look at the woman's face to know who she was.

Rhea.

Wrapped in a thick bedrobe, Demi stood aside and asked calmly, ""What happened to her?""

The two had argued that morning, and Nevin barely spared her a glance now. His voice was sharp and cold; he wasn't in the mood to talk.

""She ran into a debt collector. Got stabbed in the shoulder.""

""Debt collector?"" Demi frowned. ""Whose debt?""

She couldn't help but wonder—was the mighty CEO of Blackwell Group in financial trouble now?

Before Nevin could respond, Rhea—her face pale—spoke up weakly. ""I'm sorry, Demi. This is all my fault.""

""My dad owes money from gambling. Somehow those people found out I'm Mr. Blackwell's secretary. They tried to grab me on my way home. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Blackwell was working late and happened to be there. Otherwise, I might've been killed.""

""Cut the crap!"" Nevin interrupted sharply. ""Don't say that. As long as I'm here, no one will hurt you. But your apartment isn't safe anymore. I've called the police. Until they catch the men, you'll stay at my house.""

""No, she can't live here,"" Demi said firmly, without hesitation.

Nevin glanced up at her.

Her face was pale too, but hers was a healthy tone. Maybe because she'd finally quit her job and cleared things up with her friend, she actually looked lighter today.

Demi's cheeks held a soft flush. Her silk robe hung loosely over her frame, soft and elegant, like a lazy Persian cat basking in comfort.

The anger that had been simmering in Nevin all morning suddenly faded when he heard her refusal.

He turned his head slightly, a hint of mockery in his tone.

Of course. Another one of her little games—pretending to be calm while hiding her jealousy of Rhea.

His voice turned cold, and he warned, ""Demi, this is my house.""

He was the man of the house.

Whoever he wanted to keep—stayed.

""Still no,"" Demi replied, her voice sharp and steady.

""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

The villa was huge, three stories tall, but there were only three bedrooms suitable for sleeping.

One for Orion, one for Demi, and one for Nevin. That was it.

When they first married, there had been plenty of guest rooms, but Nevin—full of affection back then—had remodeled them all.

Now the villa had a luxury nursery, a walk-in closet, rooms for her art and yoga, and even a green room.

But no extra bedrooms.

All three bedrooms had once been planned by Nevin—for the son and daughter they hoped to have someday.

Back then, neither of them could've imagined that one day, their marriage would grow so cold that they'd sleep in separate rooms.

He hadn't expected Demi to use that as her reason for refusing Rhea to stay. Nevin's face darkened instantly.

His voice tightened with barely restrained anger. ""Demi, you're sleeping in the master bedroom.""

The meaning was clear. Nevin expected them to share a bed again.

After all, no matter how strained things had become, just three months ago they'd still shared that bed.

How else would the child in her stomach have come to be?

Demi no longer cared about this. That night three months ago had only happened because he was drunk.

There was no love, not even hate, just emptiness.

She stood her ground, refusing to budge. Her silence and defiance made Nevin's anger boil over.

Just then, a small voice broke through the tension. ""Dad? Mom? What's going on?"" Orion came down the stairs, rubbing his sleepy eyes. ""I heard you two fighting again.""

His words trailed off when he saw Rhea on the couch, her arm bandaged and a trace of blood still visible. His drowsiness vanished.

""Rhea!""

He ran to her side immediately. ""What happened? Are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Rhea smiled softly and patted his head. ""I'm fine, cupcake. Go back to bed.""

""No! You're hurt! I'm not sleeping until you feel better!""

The boy insisted, clinging tightly to Rhea's arm and refusing to let go.

Watching him clutch Rhea so affectionately, Demi let out a smile. ""Don't worry, Orion,"" she said lightly. ""Rhea will be staying with us for a few days. But since we're out of bedrooms, she'll have to share a room with you. Is that okay?""

""Really?!"" Orion's eyes went wide with excitement.

""That's awesome—""

He suddenly covered his mouth mid-sentence.

""Wait—no, Mom! That's not what I meant.""

He'd completely forgotten—Demi hated it when he got too close to Rhea. Once, he'd spent too long playing with Rhea and lost track of time. When he finally came home, Mom was furious.

From that day on, Dad taught him something. Never let your mom know how much you like Rhea or how kind she really is.

""It's fine. You can mean that,"" Demi said darkly.

Her cold hands slipped under her nightgown and rested on her stomach.

Now she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ingrate.

She still remembered the day Orion was born. Demi had been in labor for two days. The doctors told Nevin they could only save one—her or the baby.

Nevin's eyes had turned red as he shouted outside the operating room, ""Save Demi! Just save her!""

But she refused. Crying and begging through the pain, she asked the doctors to save the baby. She would give up everything but not the child she shared with Nevin.

In the end, she pushed through the pain. Demi gave birth to Orion naturally, without a dose of anesthesia.

She gave up her career and devoted herself completely to raising him.

And what did she get in return? A son who adored another woman and wished he could trade his mother for her.

Demi was exhausted.

Truth was, she hadn't even wanted this new baby. When the test came back positive last week, her first thought was to end it.

Life had already drained every bit of hope from her. She didn't want to give Nevin another child.

But now that she was leaving, a sliver of hope flickered inside of her again.

Without the weight of this family holding her back, maybe she and the baby could start fresh—live free, live better.

Realizing this, Demi decided to stop wasting her time and walked away.

Orion didn't understand why his mom was acting that way. He just stood there, staring blankly as she walked away. For a long time, he didn't move or make a sound. Then, the boy suddenly broke down crying.

Kids were sensitive, even when they didn't understand much.

But somewhere deep inside, through that invisible bond of blood, he felt it. His mother was leaving him for real.

""Waaah—!""

Rhea jumped at the sound, rushing over to comfort him. ""Don't cry, Orion. I'm with you. Don't be scared, okay? I got you.""

She looked up at Nevin, her big tearful eyes full of quiet accusation.

See? Demi made him cry again.

Nevin's face darkened. He glanced up toward the second floor, his gaze cold and heavy. Eventually, he said nothing.    


Chapter 5 I'm Done with This Family


Demi slept soundly through the night. The next morning, she came downstairs, planning to make herself breakfast.

But before she even reached the kitchen, the smell of food filled the air.

It was Rhea. She had already made breakfast for everyone and was now grinding coffee for Nevin by hand.

When Rhea saw Demi, she smiled politely. ""Good morning, Demi. You're up! Come, I made sandwiches. I hope you'll like them.""

""Rhea's cooking is wonderful. Who wouldn't like them?"" Orion chimed in brightly.

Then he sneaked a glance at his mother, his face showing a mix of fear and guilt.

He was scared of his mom, and he hated her a little, too.

Mom seemed so strange lately. Why did she always look at me coldly?

Every time he praised Rhea, Demi used to get upset but would still try harder to please him. That way, he could use her guilt to skip tutoring and have more time to play.

Demi could almost guess what her son was thinking. She gave a small, ironic smile.

Did Orion really think I couldn't see through his little tricks?

Once upon a time, she had hated Rhea because she couldn't accept her husband had a lover.

When it came to Rhea caring for Orion, Demi had always turned a blind eye.

After all, Orion was the eldest grandson. When she gave birth, Erin Blackwell, her mother-in-law, had reminded her countless times never to relax with the boy's education.

Demi had always wanted him to grow up happy. She knew her son was lively and sweet.

He loved comic books, video games, and the outdoors. But as Nevin's wife and the well-known Mrs. Blackwell in high society, she had to appear strict and proper.

Because of this, Orion would often run to his father and complain she was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that Demi had studied every major education system from around the world. She tried her best to balance discipline with play.

On the outside, she looked serious and unkind. But back when Rhea was her intern, Demi had personally drawn a set of storybook manuals and asked her to use them to help Orion learn through play.

Orion's favorite dish—orange-glazed fish—was one Rhea had learned directly from Demi.

Demi never imagined that what she once taught with care would someday cut her like a knife. Her face turned cold, a trace of disbelief and quiet despair in her eyes.

""What are you wearing?"" She asked flatly.

She didn't expect Demi's first words to be that. Rhea hesitated, her voice small and timid.

""I-it's a dress. I didn't have any clean clothes last night, so I just grabbed one from the closet. Demi, what's wrong?""

What's wrong?

A stranger was standing there in her clothes, making coffee for her husband and breakfast for her son. And Rhea had the nerve to ask what was wrong?

Nevin sensed Demi was about to make a scene. He frowned and cut in, ""Demi, it's just a dress. Don't overreact.""

He added, almost impatiently, ""You still have the card I gave you. You can buy a hundred new ones.""

Demi let out a short, bitter laugh.

Her stomach twisted. She wasn't sure if it was from morning sickness or disgust.

""Nevin,"" she said quietly, ""did you forget what that dress was?""

It was the dress she'd worn for their first night together.

Back then, Demi had just graduated—young, curious, and full of dreams.

At a business party, she thought she could help her company land a million-dollar deal. She drank too much trying to impress the clients, only to realize too late that someone had spiked her drink. That night, by accident and fate, she ended up in bed with Nevin.

The next morning, she woke up to find her clothes torn beyond repair. She sat on the edge of the bed, face burning red with embarrassment.

Nevin had found her shy reaction adorable. He sent his assistant to buy her that couture dress and later transferred her to be his personal secretary.

Demi remembered every detail. That dress marked the beginning of everything between them.

Nevin had forgotten all of it. He even let Rhea wear the same thing she once had. It was revolting.

Nevin stared at Demi, trying to read her face. A mocking smile tugged at his lips, and a strange glint flickered in his dark eyes.

""What is it?"" he asked coldly. ""Say it.

""Demi, are you seriously this sentimental over a dress?""

Sensing the tension rising in the room, Rhea hurried forward, grabbing Demi's hand as if frightened.

""Demi, please don't blame Mr. Blackwell,"" Rhea said softly, her voice trembling. ""He didn't know anything. I put it on without asking.

""Mr. Blackwell felt sorry for me that he didn't make me take it off. I didn't realize it bothered you so much.

""I'm so sorry, Demi. I'll change it out now. Please don't be upset!""

Rhea pleaded softly, eyes brimming with tears that threatened to fall at any second.

Demi felt sick. She yanked her hand away. ""It's fine. That dress looks great on you. It's yours now.""

She gave a faint, bitter smile. ""In fact, take whatever you like from my closet. Clothes, shoes—whatever catches your eye, including ... ""

Her gaze lifted to Nevin. She let out a mocking smile.

""Everything I have in this house is yours.""

""Demi!""

Nevin finally lost control at the declaration. He slammed his hand on the table, his voice bursting with anger.

""Do you have to push her into corner?""

Demi laughed faintly, her tone icy. ""I'm not the one doing the pushing here, Nevin. You two are.""

Ring! Ring!

A notification tone cut through the tension. Demi glanced at her phone.

Countdown: 13 days left.

At this rate, she thought, she might not even last until then.

Every day, Nevin managed to push her a little further, testing just how much of her pride she had left.

Today it was a dress. What would it be tomorrow?

Her thoughts froze when she caught a faint scent from Rhea's body—perfume.

Perfume?

The scent was faint at first, almost like natural body fragrance. From a distance, Demi hadn't noticed it, but up close, it was strong and unmistakable.

Her face went pale. Demi had always been sensitive to smells. Her mind flashed to the rule she'd once written in her notebook.

3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.

A bitter laugh rose in her chest. So that's how it is, Nevin.

All your rules disappear the moment she's around?

Demi suddenly laughed, but tears slipped down her cheeks without warning. In that instant, she realized she couldn't wait for the countdown anymore.

She just wanted to leave now.

Her parents were waiting. Her grandfather was waiting. Even her childhood friends were waiting.

So why was she still here? Why was Nevin still standing there, letting another woman humiliate her, letting Rhea trample over the ten best years of her life?

""If you think I'm pushing you,"" Nevin said coldly, ""then get out of my house.""

His eyes were sharp, his voice cutting. Nevin finally exploded.

""All you ever do is sulk around the house like the world owes you something. Demi, didn't you say you wanted a divorce? Fine. Let's do it.""

Demi's chest rose and fell, her voice shaking with emotion. ""Fine! Then let's—""

She didn't finish. Her breath caught as she clutched her chest, face turning red, gasping for air.

Her wide eyes darted toward Rhea in disbelief.

That perfume.

It's a floral scent!

Demi's lips twisted into a faint, broken smile. ""Nevin, if you wanted me dead,"" she spoke hoarsely, ""you could've just said so.""

I had a moment last week where I felt my heart open. I knew that’s what was happening. The feeling was enormous. Bright. Luminous. Radiant. Spaciousness. Freedom. Courage. Confidence. It lasted roughly twenty seconds before it closed. Dissociation and unfeeling. Cynicism. Insecurity. Hating everyone and myself. Paranoia. Back to feeling like there’s a dark clenched fist around my heart. TRE opened everything else up but it pools around my closed heart and can’t escape. I’ve come to fear the pressure. This doesn’t feel good or healthy. Im slowing way down until I figure out what the blockage is. TRE alone seems to not be enough. But the list of things I’ve tried is massive.

I really don’t know what to do next. My intuition is I have to commit to truly avoiding distractions and suppressing activities and things like coffee too.

But this is such garbage.

My nervous system doesn’t realize this:

I am safe to open my heart and connect.

BUT It thinks I will make a fool of myself or get hurt again.

The reason I ever made a fool of myself is because of its overprotectiveness.

It humiliates me, and then blames me for the humiliation, and then closes down harder, making functioning more difficult, more humiliating, more clumsy.

It’s like being trapped by a lunatic prison warden who genuinely thinks he’s a good guy. 

I have been waiting so fucking long for my life to begin.

I really am sorry if this sounds crazy or overly emotional. I should be in therapy but I don’t know what kind to do because I’ve given thousands upon thousands of dollars to the best depth psychologist I could find and all I got out of it was a map, with no real progress.

So I’m probably sloppy-venting here. I’m very tired. I want to quit working for three months. The healing journey has made me fairly resentful of capitalism and how I have to waste my fucking life working when I truly feel I could sort all of this out right now if I could just get the space to sleep as much as my body wants, and feel and process for a while.

Chapter 1 Regret After Betrayal


""Sweetheart, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's health is getting worse. You're our only daughter. Don't you want to come home and take over the company?""

In the quiet room, Demi Snow held a paintbrush while listening to her mother's worn voice on the phone.

The dim light cast a soft glow over her canvas as she drew the final stroke of a family of three.

Carol Snow thought this was another failed attempt. But unexpectedly, Demi spoke softly, ""Okay.""

Carol froze for a moment, surprised. ""Y-you agreed?""

""Yes,"" Demi said calmly. ""I'll come home. I just need some time to finish things here. I'll be home within two weeks.""

After exchanging a few more words, Demi ended the call.

She walked out of her studio and looked down from the staircase into the living room. Three people sat there.

Her gaze lingered on the man sitting on the couch.

He had sharp, handsome features—deep-set eyes, clean lines, and a quiet, serious aura. His shirt was buttoned all the way up, his dress pants crisp and perfect. Everything about him screamed control and elegance.

That was her husband, Nevin Blackwell, the man she had chosen against her family's wishes. She once believed Nevin was worth giving up everything for.

Nevin was known for his cold, distant manner. People in his circle called him the Ice Prince. But right now, he was smiling softly at another woman.

Nearby, a six-year-old boy with bright eyes ran into the woman's arms. ""Rhea, can you make me some orange-glazed fish? Please?""

Rhea Dunn touched his nose affectionately and smiled. ""Of course, cupcake.""

Orion Blackwell's eyes lit up with joy. ""You're the best! You're different than my mom; she never lets me eat what I want.""

He pouted after saying that.

Rhea smiled and said gently, ""Then you should eat a little more today.""

Orion nodded, his face bright with a sweet grin. ""Rhea, you're so nice. I wish you were my real mom.""

Rhea's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Demi's heart ached painfully.

She knew Orion could get greedy with food. Demi limited his portions because she didn't want his stomach to hurt later.

But watching them now—her husband, her son, and that woman—they looked like a real family. She was the one left out.

Demi went back to her room.

A few minutes later, footsteps sounded outside.

The door opened. Rhea walked in, her makeup flawless, her expression soft and gentle. ""Demi,"" she said sweetly, ""let's go downstairs and celebrate Orion's birthday together.""

Rhea used to be her intern. She'd come from a poor family and had just enough skill to get by. Demi still remembered the day Rhea broke down in her office, crying that if she couldn't find a job soon, she'd have to marry some guy back home.

Demi had taken pity on her and brought her into the company.

Who could've guessed she'd end up inviting a snake into her home?

Rhea copied everything Demi did—her style, her voice, and even how she spoke to Nevin. By the time Demi realized it, Rhea was already part of their home, close to both her husband and her son.

Demi had long seen through her act. She hated herself for letting a snake into the house.

""I'm not feeling well,"" she said coldly. ""I'll pass.""

Rhea put on her best innocent act. ""Demi, you're his mom. Orion needs your blessing today.""

Demi frowned, ready to refuse again, but then stopped. She sighed.

This is between me and Rhea. Orion shouldn't suffer because of it.

As his mother, I owe him my presence on his birthday.

Demi put down her paintbrush, brushed past Rhea, and headed downstairs.

For a second, Rhea's smile stiffened. A flash of malice crossed her eyes before she followed.

When Demi saw Nevin and Orion together, she froze.

Ten years ago, she joined Blackwell Group to gain experience and met Nevin there. They fought, laughed, and somehow fell in love. Against her family's wishes, she married him. Demi even cut ties with them because of it.

For the past decade, Demi never once regretted her choice. She had a rich, handsome husband who treated her well and a smart, adorable child.

She thought her life was perfect until Rhea showed up.

Demi watched as Rhea smiled sweetly, serving food for Nevin and Orion.

Rhea's arrival had shattered everything that once felt beautiful.

Demi picked up her fork, ready to eat, but suddenly felt a wave of nausea.

She set it down quickly and ran to the restroom, retching over the sink.

Nevin looked worried and started to follow her, but Rhea stopped him. Her eyes filled with concern.

""Mr. Blackwell, what's wrong with Demi?"" she asked anxiously.

Nevin comforted gently. ""She's been doing this lately. It's nothing; don't worry.""

Then he turned toward the restroom and mocked coldly, ""What's your excuse this time? Did you catch a cold? Or is the food not good enough again?""

Demi said nothing. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue.

If she told them she was pregnant, would anyone believe her?

Forget it. She was already planning to leave. Why should she tell them?

There's no point in ruining the sweet moment between her husband and that homewrecker.

Rhea was a secretary, but she had the nerve to scold her boss. ""Mr. Blackwell, don't talk like that. Maybe she really doesn't feel well. She's lost so much weight lately.""

She stood up, poured a cup of hot tea, and handed it to Demi.

""Are you okay? Here, drink some tea.""

The sight of her disgusting face made Demi feel even sicker. Irritated, she pushed her hand away.

She hadn't used much force, but Rhea stumbled slightly. Somehow, the water spilled on Rhea's hand.

""Ouch!"" Rhea cried out in pain.

""Rhea!""

""Rhea!""

Nevin and Orion rushed over at the same time. The father and son stared at Rhea's red, scalded hand with panic and concern.

Her fair skin had turned bright red from the burn.

Tears filled Orion's eyes as he looked at Rhea. ""Does it hurt a lot?"" The boy asked softly, his voice trembling with worry.

Rhea forced a smile, pretending to be strong. ""It's okay, Orion. I wasn't careful. It doesn't hurt.""

Nevin turned toward Demi, his eyes burning with anger.

His voice was cold as ice. ""What trouble are you trying to cause this time?""

Demi's heart twisted in pain. She caught Rhea's smug look, then saw her son standing protectively in front of her. Hopelessness washed over her, and she closed her eyes.

""I didn't do anything,"" she said quietly.

But of course, Nevin didn't believe her.

When the family doctor arrived, Nevin helped Rhea sit up, letting her lean against his chest. His dark eyes were filled with disappointment.

""Demi, you've changed. The woman I knew would never do something like this out of jealousy.""

Changed?

Yes. She had changed.

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had a stomach full of stretch marks from giving birth. She wouldn't have dull skin from sleepless nights.

And she wouldn't have given up her career to cook and clean for a man, only to be replaced by someone new.

Demi suddenly felt exhausted. She swallowed her explanation and went upstairs.

Before entering her room, she looked back one last time. The living room was chaos, but in the middle of it stood her husband and son, both surrounding Rhea with concern, like a perfect little family.

Demi smiled bitterly and shook her head. Gently, she placed a hand on her stomach and set a countdown to her departure on her phone.

Then she walked into her room without hesitation.

From that moment on, she promised herself she would never disturb them again.            


Chapter 2 I'm Done Playing This Ridiculous Game


The noise outside slowly faded away. Demi didn't care what was going on. She just put on her earplugs and eye mask and slept until morning.

She'd decided to go home and took over the family business. That meant she had to quit her job here.

Since giving birth to Orion, she had rarely appeared at the company. But back when Nevin took over the Blackwell Group, she was right there beside him, helping build everything step by step.

Blackwell Group wouldn't have become the country's top firm without her.

So even though she hadn't worked in the office for years, she still received a large annual bonus and dividends.

Early that morning, Demi stared at her reflection in the mirror. Her long wavy brown hair framed a delicate face, but her pretty charming eyes carried no trace of a smile.

She was beautiful. No one could deny that. Even after years as a stay-at-home wife, all the exhaustion and stress hadn't taken away her charm.

But the emotional abuse at home and the stress of pregnancy had drained the light from her eyes, making them look lifeless and dull now.

At the top floor of Blackwell Group, Demi was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Behind her, she overheard a few employees chatting.

""Did you see Rhea's Instagram?""

""Not yet. What did she post this time?""

""Plenty. Looks like she was celebrating someone's birthday. You've got to see it.""

They laughed, but when they looked up and saw Demi standing there, their smiles froze.

""Uh—M-Ms. Snow?""

""Ms. Snow, you're back at the office?""

Demi gave them a polite nod. They quickly murmured a goodbye and rushed off.

As they disappeared down the hall, she could still hear them whispering.

""Ugh, what bad luck. Why's Demi here?""

""She's already married Mr. Blackwell. Why show off in front of us?""

""Please, I bet she and Mr. Blackwell aren't doing great. Wouldn't be surprised if they're getting divorced.""

Demi wasn't bothered with this. She was used to this kind of talk. Her coworkers had never liked her much.

If it hadn't been for all the office bullying she faced early on and Nevin stepping in to help, she probably would've never fallen for him.

Bored from waiting, she unlocked her phone and opened Instagram.

The first thing she saw was Rhea's new post. A collage of nine pictures.

The first one was from Orion's birthday party last night, lavishly decorated with balloons and a huge three-layer cake right in the center.

But what caught Demi's eye was a hospital photo. Three hands of different sizes stacked together. It looked warm and cozy.

A trip to the hospital again? Just for a burn?

Demi let out a dry laugh and scrolled through the comments. They were all full of envy and well wishes.

[Wow! A birthday party for the little one? So sweet!]

[Another lovey-dovey post! Who's your mystery man, girl? Show us already]

[Doesn't matter what happens—as long as the family's together, that's happiness.]

The comments went on and on.

She knew exactly what Rhea was doing. Rhea was trying to get under her skin, trying to make her lose control, run to Nevin, and demand answers.

Once upon a time, that would've worked. She couldn't stand seeing that fake sweetness or how her husband and son would rather be with a woman who copied her every move.

But now? She was leaving soon. None of it mattered anymore.

Demi let out a faint smile and tapped the little red heart beneath the post.

A moment later, with her resignation letter in hand, Demi went straight to the CEO's office and handed it to Nevin's personal assistant.

The people in the secretary department were whispering behind her back, mocking her for showing off at the office as if she owned the place. But the moment they saw the resignation letter, the room went silent. Then someone gasped.

""""What—wait, am I seeing this right?!""

""Ms. Snow is resigning?!""

The assistant froze, panic flashing across her face. ""Mr. Blackwell is in an important meeting. Maybe we should wait until he's done—""

""Don't bother,"" Demi said with a calm smile. ""I'm just the chief of secretary in name only, remember? You have the authority to process it. No need to trouble him.""

People around whispered in low voices. ""Could the rumors be true? Did Demi and Mr. Blackwell break up? Is Ms. Dunn turning out to be a homewrecker?""

""Why did you assume it's Ms. Dunn? Isn't she married?""

""You're clueless. Did you see that hand on Instagram? That Rolex costs a fortune. No one in all of Yraka could afford it except Mr. Blackwell.""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice that Ms. Dunn took over all Ms. Snow's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""And now that she's quitting, maybe it's because she's stepping aside for good!""

Demi could hear every word of it. They'd always loved gossiping. In the past, she would've been crushed, hiding under the covers and crying into her pillow.

But now? She suddenly realized none of it mattered anymore.

She smiled at everyone as if she hadn't heard a thing, bowed politely, and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work over the past ten years. I hope Blackwell Group continues to grow and thrive.""

The office fell silent. No one knew what to say. Demi walked back to her desk and began packing up her things.

After ten years, her workspace was filled to the brim. Ten years' worth of memories were stacked neatly in front of her—books she bought when she first joined, binders filled with notes, and her old planner from when she became Nevin's secretary.

Flipping it open, she saw her handwriting still crisp and clear.

""1. He drinks a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning.""

""2. He hates people being late.""

""3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.""

Page after page was filled with small details about him—his habits, his preferences, and his temper. Every line represented her dedication.

Only God knew what Demi had gone through to be a good secretary. People always thought being a secretary was easy, that it just meant being pretty and pleasing a man with their body. They had no idea how wrong they were.

Nevin was the only one who'd ever seen the truth. He'd seen her stay late night after night, reading contracts until her eyes hurt, building presentations from scratch, and researching every single competitor the company ever had. She could list every company's data and performance by heart.

It was because of her relentless effort that the untouchable Ice Prince of the Blackwell family finally stepped down from his pedestal and became the man everyone admired today.

Demi once believed Nevin understood her better than anyone else in the world. She thought their bond went deeper than love, that they shared the same dream, the same fight. She was wrong.

Ten years of devotion, ten years of struggle and love—all of it had turned into nothing but ashes.

Demi quietly focused on cleaning up her desk when the meeting ended. Rhea was the first to step out.

She looked quite cheerful at first, but the moment she saw Demi, her smile froze.

What is she doing here?

Did Demi see the post on Instagram? Is she here to confront me?

Rhea grew excited just thinking about it. She couldn't sit still as she went back to her desk, waiting nervously for the storm to hit.

She lowered her head, eyes red, looking like she'd just been terribly wronged.

Nevin was the last to leave the conference room. As he passed the secretary department, he noticed Demi sitting there.

Her desk was the closest to his office—a symbol of trust and affection back in the days when they were still in love.

But now, just the sight of her made him irritated.

What made it worse was how cheerful she looked. Demi was flipping through a book with a small smile on her face.

Across from her, Rhea sat miserably, dabbing her tears with a tissue.

Nevin frowned.

He tapped the edge of Demi's desk and said coldly, ""Come in.""

Demi looked up, her expression composed. ""Okay,"" she replied simply.

The moment she stepped into his office, his voice turned icy.

""The company doesn't need you here anymore. Unless there's something important, don't show up in the office again.""            


Chapter 3 I Quit, Mr. Blackwell


Demi froze. No matter how many times Nevin had disappointed her, his cold voice still pierced her heart like a needle.

Her smile faded. ""Alright,"" she said quietly, eyes downcast.

Nevin had expected Demi to fight back, maybe even yell. But her calm obedience caught him off guard. For the first time, he really looked at her.

Rhea was right. Demi had lost a lot of weight lately.

Maybe her nausea last night wasn't a jealous act after all.

Nevin pressed his lips together, his tone softening a little. ""Ms. Dunn is doing great at her job. Your only duty now is to take care of Orion.""

Then his voice turned sharp again. ""I've told you many times—there's nothing going on between me and her. Demi, stop being dramatic. Don't make me regret choosing you as my wife.""

Regret?

She smiled bitterly. If anyone regretted it, it was her. She had given up her family business and traded it for this hollow title as his wife.

Demi came from a prestigious family. Wouldn't it be better to go back and live as the beloved heiress of the Snow Group, adored and protected by everyone?

Closing her eyes, Demi pulled out an envelope and handed it to him. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Blackwell, please approve my resignation. Starting tomorrow, I'll officially leave the company.""

She turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, Nevin grabbed her arm.

""Demi?""

His voice carried surprise, as if he hadn't processed what just happened.

Nevin glanced down at the resignation letter in his hand, her signature printed clearly in black ink. His face darkened, anger flickering in his eyes.

""You're doing this out of spite?"" he demanded.

""I thought you came here to make peace, but you're just making it worse?""

Demi kept her gaze low, her long lashes trembling slightly.

""No, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said calmly. ""You said the company doesn't need me. Turns out, I feel the same way.""

""Ten years have passed. This company isn't what it used to be,"" Demi said calmly. ""Since everyone seems to adore Ms. Dunn, there's no point in me sitting around collecting a paycheck. I'd rather step down and make room for her.""

Nevin let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp as blades, cutting straight through her words.

""Don't use these ten years to guilt-trip me. I know how much you've done for this company. You were a good employee once. But Demi, ever since you gave birth, you haven't been involved in business at all. I've been patient with you.""

He leaned closer, his tone low and dismissive. ""As long as you take care of our child, you'll always be the lady of the household. That's all I've ever asked, but you couldn't even manage that.""

Nevin's voice grew harsher. ""And now you want to step down gracefully? You just want to throw Rhea into the spotlight and make her take the blame. Demi, I know you too well. You're full of scheme, but I'm warning you don't be so vicious.""

He paused, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Have you even apologized to Rhea for the incident happened last night?""

Apologize?

To the homewrecker destroyed my family?

Shouldn't Rhea be the one who owed me a thank you?

Demi suddenly laughed, the sound soft but cutting. She tilted her head, looking at him with calm curiosity. ""You're right. I'm vicious. But tell me, Mr. Blackwell, have you ever thought about giving up the appearance?""

By giving up meant divorce.

They'd fought about it many times over the years. Every argument ended the same way—no resolution, just silence.

Nevin would never agree. Even if he cheated, Demi was still his wife.

That was the kind of man Nevin was—controlling, arrogant, and born to dominate.

At first, Demi didn't really want to leave. She just wanted him to look at her again, to remember she was there.

But now, she was tired.

A clean break, each walked their own ways.

Each of them had a child. That didn't sound so bad anymore.

Nevin's expression darkened like a storm. He grabbed her arm so hard it hurt, his grip full of rage.

""This is your last chance, Demi. If you keep failing, I'll have to find Orion a new mother.""

He didn't stop there. ""Do you know how many times Orion's told me he's miserable with you? No fun. No freedom. Nothing.""

His voice turned to ice. ""Why do you fail at everything—as a wife and as a mother?""

Failure.

Demi closed her eyes and let out a long, shaky breath.

So that's how it was.

All those nights she stayed up waiting for him, making him warm lemon tea after his drinking session was a failure.

The times she hand-washed his couture suits and got frostbite in the dead of winter—failure.

Even teaching their son advanced math to meet the high standards of being a heir of the Blackwells—still a failure.

There was no place left for her in this house.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said quietly.

Her tone was calm, sincere.

A loser should know when to take her final bow.

Her other hand slipped into her pocket. She opened her phone and tapped the screen.

A countdown started—another 14 days to go.

When it hit zero, she would be gone. Completely. No more arguments, no more tears, no more bothering Nevin with her existence.

Her calmness caught him off guard.

Nevin wanted to say something—anything—but Demi didn't give him the chance.

She walked away resolutely. Nevin reached out to stop her, but his hand closed on nothing but air.

A sharp pain clenched his chest as he watched her go, a strange panic building inside him.

Nevin frowned, watching Demi walk away. It felt like something important, something he couldn't name was slipping further and further from him.

Once she stepped outside, Demi pulled out her phone and made a call to her best friend, Phoebe Lennon.

They used to be best friends, but they hadn't spoken in seven years.

Phoebe was a fashion designer who practically lived on airplanes, traveling across the country to tailor clothes for models.

Some were male, some female. Well, things sometimes happened between adults who worked that closely.

To put it simply, Phoebe changed boyfriends as easily as changing outfits. Nevin couldn't stand that about her. After Demi gave birth to Orion, he told her to stay away from Phoebe, worried she'd be a bad influence and corrupted their son.

And Demi listened. She actually listened. For six whole years, she cut off her oldest friend, just because her husband said so.

It had been a long time since Phoebe last heard from Demi. The moment she picked up, her voice was sharp with anger. ""So you finally remembered me! I thought you'd completely lost your mind over that man. What happened? Regret finally hit you?""

Demi couldn't help but laugh through her tears.

Nevin's insults hadn't made her cry. Rhea's tricks hadn't made her cry. Even watching her son calling another woman mother hadn't broken her.

But hearing Phoebe's voice did. For the first time, she cried from regret.

""Yes,"" she admitted. ""I regret it. Phoebe, Is it too late to come back to you now?""

Hearing Demi's sincere voice, there was a long pause on the other end. When Phoebe finally spoke again, her voice was trembling with tears too.

""It's never too late. You finally came to your senses. You idiot, do you know how hard it's been running the studio without you all these years?""

Her tone turned fierce again, full of emotion. ""The entire art world's been waiting for you! Demi, being a corporate secretary is a waste of your gift. You were born to hold a brush—you're the greatest painter of our time, the last jewel of the Impressionists. I've been waiting for you.""

""I'm sorry, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.""

Standing on the busy street, Demi crouched down and sobbed.

She should've never forgotten who she was. She used to be so proud.

Born gifted, brilliant, and proud—Nevin never even knew that Demi had studied fine arts overseas.

Her graduation piece had been selected for the Janbus International Art Exhibition, shocking the art world.

After that, her paintings sold for seven-figure prices at auction.

And yet, she'd walked away from all of it. For the sake of living experience, she had taken a regular office job, learned administration, finance, and management and still excelled.

After ten long years away from her canvas, she decided she was done hiding. She was going home—to art, to herself.             


Chapter 4 I'm Done with This Ungrateful Brat


After setting a date with Phoebe to hand over the studio, Demi went home.

She gave herself two weeks. Ten years was such a long time. There were too many loose ends to tie up before she could walk away for good.

The biggest issue at hand was the household itself.

The huge 5,000-square-foot villa didn't have a single helper because Nevin complained they were noisy.

So, Demi handled every bit of cleaning herself.

If she was going to leave, she wanted to do it gracefully—like a professional, like the perfect secretary she'd always been. That was her pride as the heiress of the Snows.

Rhea, of course, wasn't the type to do chores. Demi decided to find a good maid for her husband and son.

All day, she interviewed candidates. She asked them to cook soups the way Nevin liked them. That night, while Demi was having dinner, a panicked shout came from the door.

""Bill! Call the family doctor—now!""

It was Nevin's voice.

Demi froze. Being pregnant, the faint smell of blood made her sick.

Her heart twisted with worry.

What happened? Is he hurt?

She hurried toward the entrance—only to see Nevin rushing in, carrying a woman in his arms. Snow was falling outside, clinging to his hair and coat, but he didn't seem to notice.

Nevin laid the woman on the couch, voice tight with anger. ""Where is the doctor? Get the doctor here, now!""

Demi didn't even have to look at the woman's face to know who she was.

Rhea.

Wrapped in a thick bedrobe, Demi stood aside and asked calmly, ""What happened to her?""

The two had argued that morning, and Nevin barely spared her a glance now. His voice was sharp and cold; he wasn't in the mood to talk.

""She ran into a debt collector. Got stabbed in the shoulder.""

""Debt collector?"" Demi frowned. ""Whose debt?""

She couldn't help but wonder—was the mighty CEO of Blackwell Group in financial trouble now?

Before Nevin could respond, Rhea—her face pale—spoke up weakly. ""I'm sorry, Demi. This is all my fault.""

""My dad owes money from gambling. Somehow those people found out I'm Mr. Blackwell's secretary. They tried to grab me on my way home. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Blackwell was working late and happened to be there. Otherwise, I might've been killed.""

""Cut the crap!"" Nevin interrupted sharply. ""Don't say that. As long as I'm here, no one will hurt you. But your apartment isn't safe anymore. I've called the police. Until they catch the men, you'll stay at my house.""

""No, she can't live here,"" Demi said firmly, without hesitation.

Nevin glanced up at her.

Her face was pale too, but hers was a healthy tone. Maybe because she'd finally quit her job and cleared things up with her friend, she actually looked lighter today.

Demi's cheeks held a soft flush. Her silk robe hung loosely over her frame, soft and elegant, like a lazy Persian cat basking in comfort.

The anger that had been simmering in Nevin all morning suddenly faded when he heard her refusal.

He turned his head slightly, a hint of mockery in his tone.

Of course. Another one of her little games—pretending to be calm while hiding her jealousy of Rhea.

His voice turned cold, and he warned, ""Demi, this is my house.""

He was the man of the house.

Whoever he wanted to keep—stayed.

""Still no,"" Demi replied, her voice sharp and steady.

""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

The villa was huge, three stories tall, but there were only three bedrooms suitable for sleeping.

One for Orion, one for Demi, and one for Nevin. That was it.

When they first married, there had been plenty of guest rooms, but Nevin—full of affection back then—had remodeled them all.

Now the villa had a luxury nursery, a walk-in closet, rooms for her art and yoga, and even a green room.

But no extra bedrooms.

All three bedrooms had once been planned by Nevin—for the son and daughter they hoped to have someday.

Back then, neither of them could've imagined that one day, their marriage would grow so cold that they'd sleep in separate rooms.

He hadn't expected Demi to use that as her reason for refusing Rhea to stay. Nevin's face darkened instantly.

His voice tightened with barely restrained anger. ""Demi, you're sleeping in the master bedroom.""

The meaning was clear. Nevin expected them to share a bed again.

After all, no matter how strained things had become, just three months ago they'd still shared that bed.

How else would the child in her stomach have come to be?

Demi no longer cared about this. That night three months ago had only happened because he was drunk.

There was no love, not even hate, just emptiness.

She stood her ground, refusing to budge. Her silence and defiance made Nevin's anger boil over.

Just then, a small voice broke through the tension. ""Dad? Mom? What's going on?"" Orion came down the stairs, rubbing his sleepy eyes. ""I heard you two fighting again.""

His words trailed off when he saw Rhea on the couch, her arm bandaged and a trace of blood still visible. His drowsiness vanished.

""Rhea!""

He ran to her side immediately. ""What happened? Are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Rhea smiled softly and patted his head. ""I'm fine, cupcake. Go back to bed.""

""No! You're hurt! I'm not sleeping until you feel better!""

The boy insisted, clinging tightly to Rhea's arm and refusing to let go.

Watching him clutch Rhea so affectionately, Demi let out a smile. ""Don't worry, Orion,"" she said lightly. ""Rhea will be staying with us for a few days. But since we're out of bedrooms, she'll have to share a room with you. Is that okay?""

""Really?!"" Orion's eyes went wide with excitement.

""That's awesome—""

He suddenly covered his mouth mid-sentence.

""Wait—no, Mom! That's not what I meant.""

He'd completely forgotten—Demi hated it when he got too close to Rhea. Once, he'd spent too long playing with Rhea and lost track of time. When he finally came home, Mom was furious.

From that day on, Dad taught him something. Never let your mom know how much you like Rhea or how kind she really is.

""It's fine. You can mean that,"" Demi said darkly.

Her cold hands slipped under her nightgown and rested on her stomach.

Now she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ingrate.

She still remembered the day Orion was born. Demi had been in labor for two days. The doctors told Nevin they could only save one—her or the baby.

Nevin's eyes had turned red as he shouted outside the operating room, ""Save Demi! Just save her!""

But she refused. Crying and begging through the pain, she asked the doctors to save the baby. She would give up everything but not the child she shared with Nevin.

In the end, she pushed through the pain. Demi gave birth to Orion naturally, without a dose of anesthesia.

She gave up her career and devoted herself completely to raising him.

And what did she get in return? A son who adored another woman and wished he could trade his mother for her.

Demi was exhausted.

Truth was, she hadn't even wanted this new baby. When the test came back positive last week, her first thought was to end it.

Life had already drained every bit of hope from her. She didn't want to give Nevin another child.

But now that she was leaving, a sliver of hope flickered inside of her again.

Without the weight of this family holding her back, maybe she and the baby could start fresh—live free, live better.

Realizing this, Demi decided to stop wasting her time and walked away.

Orion didn't understand why his mom was acting that way. He just stood there, staring blankly as she walked away. For a long time, he didn't move or make a sound. Then, the boy suddenly broke down crying.

Kids were sensitive, even when they didn't understand much.

But somewhere deep inside, through that invisible bond of blood, he felt it. His mother was leaving him for real.

""Waaah—!""

Rhea jumped at the sound, rushing over to comfort him. ""Don't cry, Orion. I'm with you. Don't be scared, okay? I got you.""

She looked up at Nevin, her big tearful eyes full of quiet accusation.

See? Demi made him cry again.

Nevin's face darkened. He glanced up toward the second floor, his gaze cold and heavy. Eventually, he said nothing.    


Chapter 5 I'm Done with This Family


Demi slept soundly through the night. The next morning, she came downstairs, planning to make herself breakfast.

But before she even reached the kitchen, the smell of food filled the air.

It was Rhea. She had already made breakfast for everyone and was now grinding coffee for Nevin by hand.

When Rhea saw Demi, she smiled politely. ""Good morning, Demi. You're up! Come, I made sandwiches. I hope you'll like them.""

""Rhea's cooking is wonderful. Who wouldn't like them?"" Orion chimed in brightly.

Then he sneaked a glance at his mother, his face showing a mix of fear and guilt.

He was scared of his mom, and he hated her a little, too.

Mom seemed so strange lately. Why did she always look at me coldly?

Every time he praised Rhea, Demi used to get upset but would still try harder to please him. That way, he could use her guilt to skip tutoring and have more time to play.

Demi could almost guess what her son was thinking. She gave a small, ironic smile.

Did Orion really think I couldn't see through his little tricks?

Once upon a time, she had hated Rhea because she couldn't accept her husband had a lover.

When it came to Rhea caring for Orion, Demi had always turned a blind eye.

After all, Orion was the eldest grandson. When she gave birth, Erin Blackwell, her mother-in-law, had reminded her countless times never to relax with the boy's education.

Demi had always wanted him to grow up happy. She knew her son was lively and sweet.

He loved comic books, video games, and the outdoors. But as Nevin's wife and the well-known Mrs. Blackwell in high society, she had to appear strict and proper.

Because of this, Orion would often run to his father and complain she was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that Demi had studied every major education system from around the world. She tried her best to balance discipline with play.

On the outside, she looked serious and unkind. But back when Rhea was her intern, Demi had personally drawn a set of storybook manuals and asked her to use them to help Orion learn through play.

Orion's favorite dish—orange-glazed fish—was one Rhea had learned directly from Demi.

Demi never imagined that what she once taught with care would someday cut her like a knife. Her face turned cold, a trace of disbelief and quiet despair in her eyes.

""What are you wearing?"" She asked flatly.

She didn't expect Demi's first words to be that. Rhea hesitated, her voice small and timid.

""I-it's a dress. I didn't have any clean clothes last night, so I just grabbed one from the closet. Demi, what's wrong?""

What's wrong?

A stranger was standing there in her clothes, making coffee for her husband and breakfast for her son. And Rhea had the nerve to ask what was wrong?

Nevin sensed Demi was about to make a scene. He frowned and cut in, ""Demi, it's just a dress. Don't overreact.""

He added, almost impatiently, ""You still have the card I gave you. You can buy a hundred new ones.""

Demi let out a short, bitter laugh.

Her stomach twisted. She wasn't sure if it was from morning sickness or disgust.

""Nevin,"" she said quietly, ""did you forget what that dress was?""

It was the dress she'd worn for their first night together.

Back then, Demi had just graduated—young, curious, and full of dreams.

At a business party, she thought she could help her company land a million-dollar deal. She drank too much trying to impress the clients, only to realize too late that someone had spiked her drink. That night, by accident and fate, she ended up in bed with Nevin.

The next morning, she woke up to find her clothes torn beyond repair. She sat on the edge of the bed, face burning red with embarrassment.

Nevin had found her shy reaction adorable. He sent his assistant to buy her that couture dress and later transferred her to be his personal secretary.

Demi remembered every detail. That dress marked the beginning of everything between them.

Nevin had forgotten all of it. He even let Rhea wear the same thing she once had. It was revolting.

Nevin stared at Demi, trying to read her face. A mocking smile tugged at his lips, and a strange glint flickered in his dark eyes.

""What is it?"" he asked coldly. ""Say it.

""Demi, are you seriously this sentimental over a dress?""

Sensing the tension rising in the room, Rhea hurried forward, grabbing Demi's hand as if frightened.

""Demi, please don't blame Mr. Blackwell,"" Rhea said softly, her voice trembling. ""He didn't know anything. I put it on without asking.

""Mr. Blackwell felt sorry for me that he didn't make me take it off. I didn't realize it bothered you so much.

""I'm so sorry, Demi. I'll change it out now. Please don't be upset!""

Rhea pleaded softly, eyes brimming with tears that threatened to fall at any second.

Demi felt sick. She yanked her hand away. ""It's fine. That dress looks great on you. It's yours now.""

She gave a faint, bitter smile. ""In fact, take whatever you like from my closet. Clothes, shoes—whatever catches your eye, including ... ""

Her gaze lifted to Nevin. She let out a mocking smile.

""Everything I have in this house is yours.""

""Demi!""

Nevin finally lost control at the declaration. He slammed his hand on the table, his voice bursting with anger.

""Do you have to push her into corner?""

Demi laughed faintly, her tone icy. ""I'm not the one doing the pushing here, Nevin. You two are.""

Ring! Ring!

A notification tone cut through the tension. Demi glanced at her phone.

Countdown: 13 days left.

At this rate, she thought, she might not even last until then.

Every day, Nevin managed to push her a little further, testing just how much of her pride she had left.

Today it was a dress. What would it be tomorrow?

Her thoughts froze when she caught a faint scent from Rhea's body—perfume.

Perfume?

The scent was faint at first, almost like natural body fragrance. From a distance, Demi hadn't noticed it, but up close, it was strong and unmistakable.

Her face went pale. Demi had always been sensitive to smells. Her mind flashed to the rule she'd once written in her notebook.

3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.

A bitter laugh rose in her chest. So that's how it is, Nevin.

All your rules disappear the moment she's around?

Demi suddenly laughed, but tears slipped down her cheeks without warning. In that instant, she realized she couldn't wait for the countdown anymore.

She just wanted to leave now.

Her parents were waiting. Her grandfather was waiting. Even her childhood friends were waiting.

So why was she still here? Why was Nevin still standing there, letting another woman humiliate her, letting Rhea trample over the ten best years of her life?

""If you think I'm pushing you,"" Nevin said coldly, ""then get out of my house.""

His eyes were sharp, his voice cutting. Nevin finally exploded.

""All you ever do is sulk around the house like the world owes you something. Demi, didn't you say you wanted a divorce? Fine. Let's do it.""

Demi's chest rose and fell, her voice shaking with emotion. ""Fine! Then let's—""

She didn't finish. Her breath caught as she clutched her chest, face turning red, gasping for air.

Her wide eyes darted toward Rhea in disbelief.

That perfume.

It's a floral scent!

Demi's lips twisted into a faint, broken smile. ""Nevin, if you wanted me dead,"" she spoke hoarsely, ""you could've just said so.""

Then everything went black.",1,1763212969.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Husband ignoring “homework” from therapist 83 replies

**Borae · Today 12:19**

>Husband and I have only been married for 2 years. And unfortunately we are already struggling. So much so we have been seeing a relationship therapist.

>One of the things I mentioned was that I feel rejected when my husband doesn’t acknowledge and reciprocate my small attempts at connection.

>He works extremely longs hours and owns his own practice. So will often come home at midnight if needs be. So small little gestures are a way for me to show appreciation for him. I will bake him his favourite treat and leave a sticky note for example or bring him up a coffee in a heart shaped mug.

>I get nothing. Therapist told husband he should do his best to connect with me. Ie send me a text during the day. Just so I know he is thinking about me.

>Sadly, this has not happened. I’ve gently reminded him but still nothing. I’m only 31 I can’t live without any romantic connection. Husband just blames his unsocial job. But that’s not an excuse. A note would take 5 secs.

>What can/should I do? I’m hurt by his lack of effort

>He was supposed to find 5 ways to show me he is thinking of me between appointments. So far nothing has materialised. We’re housemates.

I’ve tried to give it a fair shot — fresh beans from top UK roasters, filtered water, tweaking grind size, dose, shot time, the works. Sometimes I get a great espresso. Other times, with the exact same settings and beans, it’s a mess — either nothing comes out or I get watery sludge. The inconsistency is starting to take the joy out of it.

I don’t mind putting in a bit of effort — I’m not looking for instant coffee. But I do want a setup that’s consistent and doesn’t feel like I need a lab coat just to make a morning shot.

At this point I’m thinking of returning the machine and going down a different route. Budget’s around £1,500 max, but I’d happily spend less if it means reliable, repeatable results.

So I guess my questions are:

Are separate machines (grinder + espresso machine) genuinely more reliable than all-in-ones like this?

Would I be better off with a simpler, more manual setup that just works?

Or is there a model/setup people here have found that’s actually consistent and not such a pain to dial in?

Chapter 1 Regret After Betrayal


""Sweetheart, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's health is getting worse. You're our only daughter. Don't you want to come home and take over the company?""

In the quiet room, Demi Snow held a paintbrush while listening to her mother's worn voice on the phone.

The dim light cast a soft glow over her canvas as she drew the final stroke of a family of three.

Carol Snow thought this was another failed attempt. But unexpectedly, Demi spoke softly, ""Okay.""

Carol froze for a moment, surprised. ""Y-you agreed?""

""Yes,"" Demi said calmly. ""I'll come home. I just need some time to finish things here. I'll be home within two weeks.""

After exchanging a few more words, Demi ended the call.

She walked out of her studio and looked down from the staircase into the living room. Three people sat there.

Her gaze lingered on the man sitting on the couch.

He had sharp, handsome features—deep-set eyes, clean lines, and a quiet, serious aura. His shirt was buttoned all the way up, his dress pants crisp and perfect. Everything about him screamed control and elegance.

That was her husband, Nevin Blackwell, the man she had chosen against her family's wishes. She once believed Nevin was worth giving up everything for.

Nevin was known for his cold, distant manner. People in his circle called him the Ice Prince. But right now, he was smiling softly at another woman.

Nearby, a six-year-old boy with bright eyes ran into the woman's arms. ""Rhea, can you make me some orange-glazed fish? Please?""

Rhea Dunn touched his nose affectionately and smiled. ""Of course, cupcake.""

Orion Blackwell's eyes lit up with joy. ""You're the best! You're different than my mom; she never lets me eat what I want.""

He pouted after saying that.

Rhea smiled and said gently, ""Then you should eat a little more today.""

Orion nodded, his face bright with a sweet grin. ""Rhea, you're so nice. I wish you were my real mom.""

Rhea's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Demi's heart ached painfully.

She knew Orion could get greedy with food. Demi limited his portions because she didn't want his stomach to hurt later.

But watching them now—her husband, her son, and that woman—they looked like a real family. She was the one left out.

Demi went back to her room.

A few minutes later, footsteps sounded outside.

The door opened. Rhea walked in, her makeup flawless, her expression soft and gentle. ""Demi,"" she said sweetly, ""let's go downstairs and celebrate Orion's birthday together.""

Rhea used to be her intern. She'd come from a poor family and had just enough skill to get by. Demi still remembered the day Rhea broke down in her office, crying that if she couldn't find a job soon, she'd have to marry some guy back home.

Demi had taken pity on her and brought her into the company.

Who could've guessed she'd end up inviting a snake into her home?

Rhea copied everything Demi did—her style, her voice, and even how she spoke to Nevin. By the time Demi realized it, Rhea was already part of their home, close to both her husband and her son.

Demi had long seen through her act. She hated herself for letting a snake into the house.

""I'm not feeling well,"" she said coldly. ""I'll pass.""

Rhea put on her best innocent act. ""Demi, you're his mom. Orion needs your blessing today.""

Demi frowned, ready to refuse again, but then stopped. She sighed.

This is between me and Rhea. Orion shouldn't suffer because of it.

As his mother, I owe him my presence on his birthday.

Demi put down her paintbrush, brushed past Rhea, and headed downstairs.

For a second, Rhea's smile stiffened. A flash of malice crossed her eyes before she followed.

When Demi saw Nevin and Orion together, she froze.

Ten years ago, she joined Blackwell Group to gain experience and met Nevin there. They fought, laughed, and somehow fell in love. Against her family's wishes, she married him. Demi even cut ties with them because of it.

For the past decade, Demi never once regretted her choice. She had a rich, handsome husband who treated her well and a smart, adorable child.

She thought her life was perfect until Rhea showed up.

Demi watched as Rhea smiled sweetly, serving food for Nevin and Orion.

Rhea's arrival had shattered everything that once felt beautiful.

Demi picked up her fork, ready to eat, but suddenly felt a wave of nausea.

She set it down quickly and ran to the restroom, retching over the sink.

Nevin looked worried and started to follow her, but Rhea stopped him. Her eyes filled with concern.

""Mr. Blackwell, what's wrong with Demi?"" she asked anxiously.

Nevin comforted gently. ""She's been doing this lately. It's nothing; don't worry.""

Then he turned toward the restroom and mocked coldly, ""What's your excuse this time? Did you catch a cold? Or is the food not good enough again?""

Demi said nothing. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue.

If she told them she was pregnant, would anyone believe her?

Forget it. She was already planning to leave. Why should she tell them?

There's no point in ruining the sweet moment between her husband and that homewrecker.

Rhea was a secretary, but she had the nerve to scold her boss. ""Mr. Blackwell, don't talk like that. Maybe she really doesn't feel well. She's lost so much weight lately.""

She stood up, poured a cup of hot tea, and handed it to Demi.

""Are you okay? Here, drink some tea.""

The sight of her disgusting face made Demi feel even sicker. Irritated, she pushed her hand away.

She hadn't used much force, but Rhea stumbled slightly. Somehow, the water spilled on Rhea's hand.

""Ouch!"" Rhea cried out in pain.

""Rhea!""

""Rhea!""

Nevin and Orion rushed over at the same time. The father and son stared at Rhea's red, scalded hand with panic and concern.

Her fair skin had turned bright red from the burn.

Tears filled Orion's eyes as he looked at Rhea. ""Does it hurt a lot?"" The boy asked softly, his voice trembling with worry.

Rhea forced a smile, pretending to be strong. ""It's okay, Orion. I wasn't careful. It doesn't hurt.""

Nevin turned toward Demi, his eyes burning with anger.

His voice was cold as ice. ""What trouble are you trying to cause this time?""

Demi's heart twisted in pain. She caught Rhea's smug look, then saw her son standing protectively in front of her. Hopelessness washed over her, and she closed her eyes.

""I didn't do anything,"" she said quietly.

But of course, Nevin didn't believe her.

When the family doctor arrived, Nevin helped Rhea sit up, letting her lean against his chest. His dark eyes were filled with disappointment.

""Demi, you've changed. The woman I knew would never do something like this out of jealousy.""

Changed?

Yes. She had changed.

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had a stomach full of stretch marks from giving birth. She wouldn't have dull skin from sleepless nights.

And she wouldn't have given up her career to cook and clean for a man, only to be replaced by someone new.

Demi suddenly felt exhausted. She swallowed her explanation and went upstairs.

Before entering her room, she looked back one last time. The living room was chaos, but in the middle of it stood her husband and son, both surrounding Rhea with concern, like a perfect little family.

Demi smiled bitterly and shook her head. Gently, she placed a hand on her stomach and set a countdown to her departure on her phone.

Then she walked into her room without hesitation.

From that moment on, she promised herself she would never disturb them again.            


Chapter 2 I'm Done Playing This Ridiculous Game


The noise outside slowly faded away. Demi didn't care what was going on. She just put on her earplugs and eye mask and slept until morning.

She'd decided to go home and took over the family business. That meant she had to quit her job here.

Since giving birth to Orion, she had rarely appeared at the company. But back when Nevin took over the Blackwell Group, she was right there beside him, helping build everything step by step.

Blackwell Group wouldn't have become the country's top firm without her.

So even though she hadn't worked in the office for years, she still received a large annual bonus and dividends.

Early that morning, Demi stared at her reflection in the mirror. Her long wavy brown hair framed a delicate face, but her pretty charming eyes carried no trace of a smile.

She was beautiful. No one could deny that. Even after years as a stay-at-home wife, all the exhaustion and stress hadn't taken away her charm.

But the emotional abuse at home and the stress of pregnancy had drained the light from her eyes, making them look lifeless and dull now.

At the top floor of Blackwell Group, Demi was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Behind her, she overheard a few employees chatting.

""Did you see Rhea's Instagram?""

""Not yet. What did she post this time?""

""Plenty. Looks like she was celebrating someone's birthday. You've got to see it.""

They laughed, but when they looked up and saw Demi standing there, their smiles froze.

""Uh—M-Ms. Snow?""

""Ms. Snow, you're back at the office?""

Demi gave them a polite nod. They quickly murmured a goodbye and rushed off.

As they disappeared down the hall, she could still hear them whispering.

""Ugh, what bad luck. Why's Demi here?""

""She's already married Mr. Blackwell. Why show off in front of us?""

""Please, I bet she and Mr. Blackwell aren't doing great. Wouldn't be surprised if they're getting divorced.""

Demi wasn't bothered with this. She was used to this kind of talk. Her coworkers had never liked her much.

If it hadn't been for all the office bullying she faced early on and Nevin stepping in to help, she probably would've never fallen for him.

Bored from waiting, she unlocked her phone and opened Instagram.

The first thing she saw was Rhea's new post. A collage of nine pictures.

The first one was from Orion's birthday party last night, lavishly decorated with balloons and a huge three-layer cake right in the center.

But what caught Demi's eye was a hospital photo. Three hands of different sizes stacked together. It looked warm and cozy.

A trip to the hospital again? Just for a burn?

Demi let out a dry laugh and scrolled through the comments. They were all full of envy and well wishes.

[Wow! A birthday party for the little one? So sweet!]

[Another lovey-dovey post! Who's your mystery man, girl? Show us already]

[Doesn't matter what happens—as long as the family's together, that's happiness.]

The comments went on and on.

She knew exactly what Rhea was doing. Rhea was trying to get under her skin, trying to make her lose control, run to Nevin, and demand answers.

Once upon a time, that would've worked. She couldn't stand seeing that fake sweetness or how her husband and son would rather be with a woman who copied her every move.

But now? She was leaving soon. None of it mattered anymore.

Demi let out a faint smile and tapped the little red heart beneath the post.

A moment later, with her resignation letter in hand, Demi went straight to the CEO's office and handed it to Nevin's personal assistant.

The people in the secretary department were whispering behind her back, mocking her for showing off at the office as if she owned the place. But the moment they saw the resignation letter, the room went silent. Then someone gasped.

""""What—wait, am I seeing this right?!""

""Ms. Snow is resigning?!""

The assistant froze, panic flashing across her face. ""Mr. Blackwell is in an important meeting. Maybe we should wait until he's done—""

""Don't bother,"" Demi said with a calm smile. ""I'm just the chief of secretary in name only, remember? You have the authority to process it. No need to trouble him.""

People around whispered in low voices. ""Could the rumors be true? Did Demi and Mr. Blackwell break up? Is Ms. Dunn turning out to be a homewrecker?""

""Why did you assume it's Ms. Dunn? Isn't she married?""

""You're clueless. Did you see that hand on Instagram? That Rolex costs a fortune. No one in all of Yraka could afford it except Mr. Blackwell.""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice that Ms. Dunn took over all Ms. Snow's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""And now that she's quitting, maybe it's because she's stepping aside for good!""

Demi could hear every word of it. They'd always loved gossiping. In the past, she would've been crushed, hiding under the covers and crying into her pillow.

But now? She suddenly realized none of it mattered anymore.

She smiled at everyone as if she hadn't heard a thing, bowed politely, and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work over the past ten years. I hope Blackwell Group continues to grow and thrive.""

The office fell silent. No one knew what to say. Demi walked back to her desk and began packing up her things.

After ten years, her workspace was filled to the brim. Ten years' worth of memories were stacked neatly in front of her—books she bought when she first joined, binders filled with notes, and her old planner from when she became Nevin's secretary.

Flipping it open, she saw her handwriting still crisp and clear.

""1. He drinks a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning.""

""2. He hates people being late.""

""3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.""

Page after page was filled with small details about him—his habits, his preferences, and his temper. Every line represented her dedication.

Only God knew what Demi had gone through to be a good secretary. People always thought being a secretary was easy, that it just meant being pretty and pleasing a man with their body. They had no idea how wrong they were.

Nevin was the only one who'd ever seen the truth. He'd seen her stay late night after night, reading contracts until her eyes hurt, building presentations from scratch, and researching every single competitor the company ever had. She could list every company's data and performance by heart.

It was because of her relentless effort that the untouchable Ice Prince of the Blackwell family finally stepped down from his pedestal and became the man everyone admired today.

Demi once believed Nevin understood her better than anyone else in the world. She thought their bond went deeper than love, that they shared the same dream, the same fight. She was wrong.

Ten years of devotion, ten years of struggle and love—all of it had turned into nothing but ashes.

Demi quietly focused on cleaning up her desk when the meeting ended. Rhea was the first to step out.

She looked quite cheerful at first, but the moment she saw Demi, her smile froze.

What is she doing here?

Did Demi see the post on Instagram? Is she here to confront me?

Rhea grew excited just thinking about it. She couldn't sit still as she went back to her desk, waiting nervously for the storm to hit.

She lowered her head, eyes red, looking like she'd just been terribly wronged.

Nevin was the last to leave the conference room. As he passed the secretary department, he noticed Demi sitting there.

Her desk was the closest to his office—a symbol of trust and affection back in the days when they were still in love.

But now, just the sight of her made him irritated.

What made it worse was how cheerful she looked. Demi was flipping through a book with a small smile on her face.

Across from her, Rhea sat miserably, dabbing her tears with a tissue.

Nevin frowned.

He tapped the edge of Demi's desk and said coldly, ""Come in.""

Demi looked up, her expression composed. ""Okay,"" she replied simply.

The moment she stepped into his office, his voice turned icy.

""The company doesn't need you here anymore. Unless there's something important, don't show up in the office again.""            


Chapter 3 I Quit, Mr. Blackwell


Demi froze. No matter how many times Nevin had disappointed her, his cold voice still pierced her heart like a needle.

Her smile faded. ""Alright,"" she said quietly, eyes downcast.

Nevin had expected Demi to fight back, maybe even yell. But her calm obedience caught him off guard. For the first time, he really looked at her.

Rhea was right. Demi had lost a lot of weight lately.

Maybe her nausea last night wasn't a jealous act after all.

Nevin pressed his lips together, his tone softening a little. ""Ms. Dunn is doing great at her job. Your only duty now is to take care of Orion.""

Then his voice turned sharp again. ""I've told you many times—there's nothing going on between me and her. Demi, stop being dramatic. Don't make me regret choosing you as my wife.""

Regret?

She smiled bitterly. If anyone regretted it, it was her. She had given up her family business and traded it for this hollow title as his wife.

Demi came from a prestigious family. Wouldn't it be better to go back and live as the beloved heiress of the Snow Group, adored and protected by everyone?

Closing her eyes, Demi pulled out an envelope and handed it to him. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Blackwell, please approve my resignation. Starting tomorrow, I'll officially leave the company.""

She turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, Nevin grabbed her arm.

""Demi?""

His voice carried surprise, as if he hadn't processed what just happened.

Nevin glanced down at the resignation letter in his hand, her signature printed clearly in black ink. His face darkened, anger flickering in his eyes.

""You're doing this out of spite?"" he demanded.

""I thought you came here to make peace, but you're just making it worse?""

Demi kept her gaze low, her long lashes trembling slightly.

""No, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said calmly. ""You said the company doesn't need me. Turns out, I feel the same way.""

""Ten years have passed. This company isn't what it used to be,"" Demi said calmly. ""Since everyone seems to adore Ms. Dunn, there's no point in me sitting around collecting a paycheck. I'd rather step down and make room for her.""

Nevin let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp as blades, cutting straight through her words.

""Don't use these ten years to guilt-trip me. I know how much you've done for this company. You were a good employee once. But Demi, ever since you gave birth, you haven't been involved in business at all. I've been patient with you.""

He leaned closer, his tone low and dismissive. ""As long as you take care of our child, you'll always be the lady of the household. That's all I've ever asked, but you couldn't even manage that.""

Nevin's voice grew harsher. ""And now you want to step down gracefully? You just want to throw Rhea into the spotlight and make her take the blame. Demi, I know you too well. You're full of scheme, but I'm warning you don't be so vicious.""

He paused, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Have you even apologized to Rhea for the incident happened last night?""

Apologize?

To the homewrecker destroyed my family?

Shouldn't Rhea be the one who owed me a thank you?

Demi suddenly laughed, the sound soft but cutting. She tilted her head, looking at him with calm curiosity. ""You're right. I'm vicious. But tell me, Mr. Blackwell, have you ever thought about giving up the appearance?""

By giving up meant divorce.

They'd fought about it many times over the years. Every argument ended the same way—no resolution, just silence.

Nevin would never agree. Even if he cheated, Demi was still his wife.

That was the kind of man Nevin was—controlling, arrogant, and born to dominate.

At first, Demi didn't really want to leave. She just wanted him to look at her again, to remember she was there.

But now, she was tired.

A clean break, each walked their own ways.

Each of them had a child. That didn't sound so bad anymore.

Nevin's expression darkened like a storm. He grabbed her arm so hard it hurt, his grip full of rage.

""This is your last chance, Demi. If you keep failing, I'll have to find Orion a new mother.""

He didn't stop there. ""Do you know how many times Orion's told me he's miserable with you? No fun. No freedom. Nothing.""

His voice turned to ice. ""Why do you fail at everything—as a wife and as a mother?""

Failure.

Demi closed her eyes and let out a long, shaky breath.

So that's how it was.

All those nights she stayed up waiting for him, making him warm lemon tea after his drinking session was a failure.

The times she hand-washed his couture suits and got frostbite in the dead of winter—failure.

Even teaching their son advanced math to meet the high standards of being a heir of the Blackwells—still a failure.

There was no place left for her in this house.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwell,"" she said quietly.

Her tone was calm, sincere.

A loser should know when to take her final bow.

Her other hand slipped into her pocket. She opened her phone and tapped the screen.

A countdown started—another 14 days to go.

When it hit zero, she would be gone. Completely. No more arguments, no more tears, no more bothering Nevin with her existence.

Her calmness caught him off guard.

Nevin wanted to say something—anything—but Demi didn't give him the chance.

She walked away resolutely. Nevin reached out to stop her, but his hand closed on nothing but air.

A sharp pain clenched his chest as he watched her go, a strange panic building inside him.

Nevin frowned, watching Demi walk away. It felt like something important, something he couldn't name was slipping further and further from him.

Once she stepped outside, Demi pulled out her phone and made a call to her best friend, Phoebe Lennon.

They used to be best friends, but they hadn't spoken in seven years.

Phoebe was a fashion designer who practically lived on airplanes, traveling across the country to tailor clothes for models.

Some were male, some female. Well, things sometimes happened between adults who worked that closely.

To put it simply, Phoebe changed boyfriends as easily as changing outfits. Nevin couldn't stand that about her. After Demi gave birth to Orion, he told her to stay away from Phoebe, worried she'd be a bad influence and corrupted their son.

And Demi listened. She actually listened. For six whole years, she cut off her oldest friend, just because her husband said so.

It had been a long time since Phoebe last heard from Demi. The moment she picked up, her voice was sharp with anger. ""So you finally remembered me! I thought you'd completely lost your mind over that man. What happened? Regret finally hit you?""

Demi couldn't help but laugh through her tears.

Nevin's insults hadn't made her cry. Rhea's tricks hadn't made her cry. Even watching her son calling another woman mother hadn't broken her.

But hearing Phoebe's voice did. For the first time, she cried from regret.

""Yes,"" she admitted. ""I regret it. Phoebe, Is it too late to come back to you now?""

Hearing Demi's sincere voice, there was a long pause on the other end. When Phoebe finally spoke again, her voice was trembling with tears too.

""It's never too late. You finally came to your senses. You idiot, do you know how hard it's been running the studio without you all these years?""

Her tone turned fierce again, full of emotion. ""The entire art world's been waiting for you! Demi, being a corporate secretary is a waste of your gift. You were born to hold a brush—you're the greatest painter of our time, the last jewel of the Impressionists. I've been waiting for you.""

""I'm sorry, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.""

Standing on the busy street, Demi crouched down and sobbed.

She should've never forgotten who she was. She used to be so proud.

Born gifted, brilliant, and proud—Nevin never even knew that Demi had studied fine arts overseas.

Her graduation piece had been selected for the Janbus International Art Exhibition, shocking the art world.

After that, her paintings sold for seven-figure prices at auction.

And yet, she'd walked away from all of it. For the sake of living experience, she had taken a regular office job, learned administration, finance, and management and still excelled.

After ten long years away from her canvas, she decided she was done hiding. She was going home—to art, to herself.             


Chapter 4 I'm Done with This Ungrateful Brat


After setting a date with Phoebe to hand over the studio, Demi went home.

She gave herself two weeks. Ten years was such a long time. There were too many loose ends to tie up before she could walk away for good.

The biggest issue at hand was the household itself.

The huge 5,000-square-foot villa didn't have a single helper because Nevin complained they were noisy.

So, Demi handled every bit of cleaning herself.

If she was going to leave, she wanted to do it gracefully—like a professional, like the perfect secretary she'd always been. That was her pride as the heiress of the Snows.

Rhea, of course, wasn't the type to do chores. Demi decided to find a good maid for her husband and son.

All day, she interviewed candidates. She asked them to cook soups the way Nevin liked them. That night, while Demi was having dinner, a panicked shout came from the door.

""Bill! Call the family doctor—now!""

It was Nevin's voice.

Demi froze. Being pregnant, the faint smell of blood made her sick.

Her heart twisted with worry.

What happened? Is he hurt?

She hurried toward the entrance—only to see Nevin rushing in, carrying a woman in his arms. Snow was falling outside, clinging to his hair and coat, but he didn't seem to notice.

Nevin laid the woman on the couch, voice tight with anger. ""Where is the doctor? Get the doctor here, now!""

Demi didn't even have to look at the woman's face to know who she was.

Rhea.

Wrapped in a thick bedrobe, Demi stood aside and asked calmly, ""What happened to her?""

The two had argued that morning, and Nevin barely spared her a glance now. His voice was sharp and cold; he wasn't in the mood to talk.

""She ran into a debt collector. Got stabbed in the shoulder.""

""Debt collector?"" Demi frowned. ""Whose debt?""

She couldn't help but wonder—was the mighty CEO of Blackwell Group in financial trouble now?

Before Nevin could respond, Rhea—her face pale—spoke up weakly. ""I'm sorry, Demi. This is all my fault.""

""My dad owes money from gambling. Somehow those people found out I'm Mr. Blackwell's secretary. They tried to grab me on my way home. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Blackwell was working late and happened to be there. Otherwise, I might've been killed.""

""Cut the crap!"" Nevin interrupted sharply. ""Don't say that. As long as I'm here, no one will hurt you. But your apartment isn't safe anymore. I've called the police. Until they catch the men, you'll stay at my house.""

""No, she can't live here,"" Demi said firmly, without hesitation.

Nevin glanced up at her.

Her face was pale too, but hers was a healthy tone. Maybe because she'd finally quit her job and cleared things up with her friend, she actually looked lighter today.

Demi's cheeks held a soft flush. Her silk robe hung loosely over her frame, soft and elegant, like a lazy Persian cat basking in comfort.

The anger that had been simmering in Nevin all morning suddenly faded when he heard her refusal.

He turned his head slightly, a hint of mockery in his tone.

Of course. Another one of her little games—pretending to be calm while hiding her jealousy of Rhea.

His voice turned cold, and he warned, ""Demi, this is my house.""

He was the man of the house.

Whoever he wanted to keep—stayed.

""Still no,"" Demi replied, her voice sharp and steady.

""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

The villa was huge, three stories tall, but there were only three bedrooms suitable for sleeping.

One for Orion, one for Demi, and one for Nevin. That was it.

When they first married, there had been plenty of guest rooms, but Nevin—full of affection back then—had remodeled them all.

Now the villa had a luxury nursery, a walk-in closet, rooms for her art and yoga, and even a green room.

But no extra bedrooms.

All three bedrooms had once been planned by Nevin—for the son and daughter they hoped to have someday.

Back then, neither of them could've imagined that one day, their marriage would grow so cold that they'd sleep in separate rooms.

He hadn't expected Demi to use that as her reason for refusing Rhea to stay. Nevin's face darkened instantly.

His voice tightened with barely restrained anger. ""Demi, you're sleeping in the master bedroom.""

The meaning was clear. Nevin expected them to share a bed again.

After all, no matter how strained things had become, just three months ago they'd still shared that bed.

How else would the child in her stomach have come to be?

Demi no longer cared about this. That night three months ago had only happened because he was drunk.

There was no love, not even hate, just emptiness.

She stood her ground, refusing to budge. Her silence and defiance made Nevin's anger boil over.

Just then, a small voice broke through the tension. ""Dad? Mom? What's going on?"" Orion came down the stairs, rubbing his sleepy eyes. ""I heard you two fighting again.""

His words trailed off when he saw Rhea on the couch, her arm bandaged and a trace of blood still visible. His drowsiness vanished.

""Rhea!""

He ran to her side immediately. ""What happened? Are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Rhea smiled softly and patted his head. ""I'm fine, cupcake. Go back to bed.""

""No! You're hurt! I'm not sleeping until you feel better!""

The boy insisted, clinging tightly to Rhea's arm and refusing to let go.

Watching him clutch Rhea so affectionately, Demi let out a smile. ""Don't worry, Orion,"" she said lightly. ""Rhea will be staying with us for a few days. But since we're out of bedrooms, she'll have to share a room with you. Is that okay?""

""Really?!"" Orion's eyes went wide with excitement.

""That's awesome—""

He suddenly covered his mouth mid-sentence.

""Wait—no, Mom! That's not what I meant.""

He'd completely forgotten—Demi hated it when he got too close to Rhea. Once, he'd spent too long playing with Rhea and lost track of time. When he finally came home, Mom was furious.

From that day on, Dad taught him something. Never let your mom know how much you like Rhea or how kind she really is.

""It's fine. You can mean that,"" Demi said darkly.

Her cold hands slipped under her nightgown and rested on her stomach.

Now she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ingrate.

She still remembered the day Orion was born. Demi had been in labor for two days. The doctors told Nevin they could only save one—her or the baby.

Nevin's eyes had turned red as he shouted outside the operating room, ""Save Demi! Just save her!""

But she refused. Crying and begging through the pain, she asked the doctors to save the baby. She would give up everything but not the child she shared with Nevin.

In the end, she pushed through the pain. Demi gave birth to Orion naturally, without a dose of anesthesia.

She gave up her career and devoted herself completely to raising him.

And what did she get in return? A son who adored another woman and wished he could trade his mother for her.

Demi was exhausted.

Truth was, she hadn't even wanted this new baby. When the test came back positive last week, her first thought was to end it.

Life had already drained every bit of hope from her. She didn't want to give Nevin another child.

But now that she was leaving, a sliver of hope flickered inside of her again.

Without the weight of this family holding her back, maybe she and the baby could start fresh—live free, live better.

Realizing this, Demi decided to stop wasting her time and walked away.

Orion didn't understand why his mom was acting that way. He just stood there, staring blankly as she walked away. For a long time, he didn't move or make a sound. Then, the boy suddenly broke down crying.

Kids were sensitive, even when they didn't understand much.

But somewhere deep inside, through that invisible bond of blood, he felt it. His mother was leaving him for real.

""Waaah—!""

Rhea jumped at the sound, rushing over to comfort him. ""Don't cry, Orion. I'm with you. Don't be scared, okay? I got you.""

She looked up at Nevin, her big tearful eyes full of quiet accusation.

See? Demi made him cry again.

Nevin's face darkened. He glanced up toward the second floor, his gaze cold and heavy. Eventually, he said nothing.    


Chapter 5 I'm Done with This Family


Demi slept soundly through the night. The next morning, she came downstairs, planning to make herself breakfast.

But before she even reached the kitchen, the smell of food filled the air.

It was Rhea. She had already made breakfast for everyone and was now grinding coffee for Nevin by hand.

When Rhea saw Demi, she smiled politely. ""Good morning, Demi. You're up! Come, I made sandwiches. I hope you'll like them.""

""Rhea's cooking is wonderful. Who wouldn't like them?"" Orion chimed in brightly.

Then he sneaked a glance at his mother, his face showing a mix of fear and guilt.

He was scared of his mom, and he hated her a little, too.

Mom seemed so strange lately. Why did she always look at me coldly?

Every time he praised Rhea, Demi used to get upset but would still try harder to please him. That way, he could use her guilt to skip tutoring and have more time to play.

Demi could almost guess what her son was thinking. She gave a small, ironic smile.

Did Orion really think I couldn't see through his little tricks?

Once upon a time, she had hated Rhea because she couldn't accept her husband had a lover.

When it came to Rhea caring for Orion, Demi had always turned a blind eye.

After all, Orion was the eldest grandson. When she gave birth, Erin Blackwell, her mother-in-law, had reminded her countless times never to relax with the boy's education.

Demi had always wanted him to grow up happy. She knew her son was lively and sweet.

He loved comic books, video games, and the outdoors. But as Nevin's wife and the well-known Mrs. Blackwell in high society, she had to appear strict and proper.

Because of this, Orion would often run to his father and complain she was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that Demi had studied every major education system from around the world. She tried her best to balance discipline with play.

On the outside, she looked serious and unkind. But back when Rhea was her intern, Demi had personally drawn a set of storybook manuals and asked her to use them to help Orion learn through play.

Orion's favorite dish—orange-glazed fish—was one Rhea had learned directly from Demi.

Demi never imagined that what she once taught with care would someday cut her like a knife. Her face turned cold, a trace of disbelief and quiet despair in her eyes.

""What are you wearing?"" She asked flatly.

She didn't expect Demi's first words to be that. Rhea hesitated, her voice small and timid.

""I-it's a dress. I didn't have any clean clothes last night, so I just grabbed one from the closet. Demi, what's wrong?""

What's wrong?

A stranger was standing there in her clothes, making coffee for her husband and breakfast for her son. And Rhea had the nerve to ask what was wrong?

Nevin sensed Demi was about to make a scene. He frowned and cut in, ""Demi, it's just a dress. Don't overreact.""

He added, almost impatiently, ""You still have the card I gave you. You can buy a hundred new ones.""

Demi let out a short, bitter laugh.

Her stomach twisted. She wasn't sure if it was from morning sickness or disgust.

""Nevin,"" she said quietly, ""did you forget what that dress was?""

It was the dress she'd worn for their first night together.

Back then, Demi had just graduated—young, curious, and full of dreams.

At a business party, she thought she could help her company land a million-dollar deal. She drank too much trying to impress the clients, only to realize too late that someone had spiked her drink. That night, by accident and fate, she ended up in bed with Nevin.

The next morning, she woke up to find her clothes torn beyond repair. She sat on the edge of the bed, face burning red with embarrassment.

Nevin had found her shy reaction adorable. He sent his assistant to buy her that couture dress and later transferred her to be his personal secretary.

Demi remembered every detail. That dress marked the beginning of everything between them.

Nevin had forgotten all of it. He even let Rhea wear the same thing she once had. It was revolting.

Nevin stared at Demi, trying to read her face. A mocking smile tugged at his lips, and a strange glint flickered in his dark eyes.

""What is it?"" he asked coldly. ""Say it.

""Demi, are you seriously this sentimental over a dress?""

Sensing the tension rising in the room, Rhea hurried forward, grabbing Demi's hand as if frightened.

""Demi, please don't blame Mr. Blackwell,"" Rhea said softly, her voice trembling. ""He didn't know anything. I put it on without asking.

""Mr. Blackwell felt sorry for me that he didn't make me take it off. I didn't realize it bothered you so much.

""I'm so sorry, Demi. I'll change it out now. Please don't be upset!""

Rhea pleaded softly, eyes brimming with tears that threatened to fall at any second.

Demi felt sick. She yanked her hand away. ""It's fine. That dress looks great on you. It's yours now.""

She gave a faint, bitter smile. ""In fact, take whatever you like from my closet. Clothes, shoes—whatever catches your eye, including ... ""

Her gaze lifted to Nevin. She let out a mocking smile.

""Everything I have in this house is yours.""

""Demi!""

Nevin finally lost control at the declaration. He slammed his hand on the table, his voice bursting with anger.

""Do you have to push her into corner?""

Demi laughed faintly, her tone icy. ""I'm not the one doing the pushing here, Nevin. You two are.""

Ring! Ring!

A notification tone cut through the tension. Demi glanced at her phone.

Countdown: 13 days left.

At this rate, she thought, she might not even last until then.

Every day, Nevin managed to push her a little further, testing just how much of her pride she had left.

Today it was a dress. What would it be tomorrow?

Her thoughts froze when she caught a faint scent from Rhea's body—perfume.

Perfume?

The scent was faint at first, almost like natural body fragrance. From a distance, Demi hadn't noticed it, but up close, it was strong and unmistakable.

Her face went pale. Demi had always been sensitive to smells. Her mind flashed to the rule she'd once written in her notebook.

3. He can't stand women who wear perfume.

A bitter laugh rose in her chest. So that's how it is, Nevin.

All your rules disappear the moment she's around?

Demi suddenly laughed, but tears slipped down her cheeks without warning. In that instant, she realized she couldn't wait for the countdown anymore.

She just wanted to leave now.

Her parents were waiting. Her grandfather was waiting. Even her childhood friends were waiting.

So why was she still here? Why was Nevin still standing there, letting another woman humiliate her, letting Rhea trample over the ten best years of her life?

""If you think I'm pushing you,"" Nevin said coldly, ""then get out of my house.""

His eyes were sharp, his voice cutting. Nevin finally exploded.

""All you ever do is sulk around the house like the world owes you something. Demi, didn't you say you wanted a divorce? Fine. Let's do it.""

Demi's chest rose and fell, her voice shaking with emotion. ""Fine! Then let's—""

She didn't finish. Her breath caught as she clutched her chest, face turning red, gasping for air.

Her wide eyes darted toward Rhea in disbelief.

That perfume.

It's a floral scent!

Demi's lips twisted into a faint, broken smile. ""Nevin, if you wanted me dead,"" she spoke hoarsely, ""you could've just said so.""

**Odds Breakdown & Implied Probabilities**  
The numbers scream “back the home team,” but let’s not let the math do all the talking. CD Castellón is the 74% favorite (per decimal odds of \~1.36), while Real Sociedad B is a 14-16% long shot (odds of 6.25-8.0). The draw sits at \~20-22%, which feels low given Castellón’s shaky defense (15 goals conceded) and Sociedad B’s leaky one (19). If you’re betting on Castellón, you’re essentially saying they’ll win 7 out of 10 games—*if* they had their full squad. But they don’t.

**Team News: Missing Pieces and Road Woes**  
CD Castellón is missing internationals Cipenga and Camara, plus injured star Serpeta. It’s like trying to build a puzzle with half the pieces in a different room. New coach Pablo Hernández gets his debut under these conditions—imagine coaching a chess game where your queen, rook, and bishop are all on a coffee break.

Real Sociedad B, meanwhile, is the Segunda División’s road equivalent of a ghost town: 0 wins in 6 away games. They’re the second-best at home but the worst on the road—like a toaster that’s excellent at toasting but terrible at… well, anything else if you unplug it. Their attack (18 goals) is sharp, but their defense? A sieve that’d make a Swiss cheese wheel blush.

**Humor: The Absurdity of It All**  
Castellón’s defense is so porou

1oxrbli,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oxrbli/if_you_are_struggling_to_heal_this_is_for_you_for/,If you are struggling to heal this is for you (for guys),"A quick disclaimer, this content is informational content, based on my experience not just a chatgpt post, but I did use Ai to fix any errors I might have made. 



After the disclaimer I want to start with saying If you're here, it's not by accident. You're searching for something the usual advice hit the gym, get your money up is missing. That advice isn't wrong, it's just incomplete. It focuses on the external shell while the internal structure is still damaged.

This isn't about winning the breakup. This is about winning back yourself.

First, Let's Name the Pain

What you're going through isn't a minor inconvenience. It's a form of emotional withdrawal.

You were addicted to a person. The texts, the inside jokes, the future plans, the physical presence your brain was wired for a consistent hit of them. Now, the supply is cut off. The withdrawal symptoms are real: the anxiety, the obsessive thoughts, the emptiness, the physical ache in your chest.

This isn't weak. This is human neurobiology. Acknowledging this is your first act of strength.



The Four Stages of Withdrawal (And How to Navigate Them)

Forget vague phases. Here is your field guide.

Stage 1: The Shock & The ""Scale""

You’re numb,then you’re logical. You try to weigh everything on a scale: ""Well, she was great, but we fought about X. I was bad at Y, but she was critical of Z."" This is your mind's attempt to create order from chaos.



· Your Mission Here: Information Diet. Stop analyzing the past. Your brain is a courtroom with a biased judge and no evidence. The case is closed. Do not check her social media. Do not re-read old texts. This is like picking a scab and wondering why it won't heal. Your only job is to survive the day. Eat. Hydrate. Breathe.



Stage 2: The Ache & The ""Red-Tinted Glasses""

The logic fades and the full weight of the loss hits.Everything is a trigger. A song, a smell, a street corner. The world is covered in a film of her. This isn't love anymore; it's the ghost of it.



· Your Mission Here: Reclaim Your Territory. This is active, not passive. That restaurant you loved? Go there with a friend and order something you never got with her. Those daisies? Buy a different, wild-looking flower for your own kitchen table. You are not erasing the past; you are building a new present over it.



Stage 3: The Fire & The ""Forge""

The sadness curdles into anger.This is a potent, volatile energy. It's the acid in your stomach, the fire behind your eyes. This is where most men are told to go to the gym out of spite. We're going to use it differently.



· Your Mission Here: Channel, Don't Explode. The gym is a great tool, but make your intention clear: ""This lift is for my future self, not a message to my past."" Use this energy to clean your apartment aggressively. Learn a skill you always put off. Apply for a course. This anger is pure fuel. Don't let it burn you down; use it to forge your new identity.



Stage 4: The Integration & The ""New Map""

The storm has passed.You're not ""over it,"" but you're moving forward. You might start dating and catch yourself comparing everyone to her. This is normal. You're navigating with an old map in a new city.



· Your Mission Here: Compare, But Learn. When you compare a new person to your ex, don't just feel sad. Ask why. ""She doesn't laugh like Sarah did."" Okay, so what did Sarah's laugh represent? Safety? Joy? Now you know you value a partner with a joyful spirit. You are not looking for a replacement; you are collecting data on what truly matters to you.

Your Arsenal for the Journey



This is the part the other videos skip. The ""how.""

1. The Brain Dump, Evolved: Don't just write in your notes app. Get a physical journal. Write the angry, pathetic, sad, illogical letter you'd never send. Then, in a different color pen, write a compassionate response to yourself, as if you were your own best friend.

2. Move the Emotion Through Your Body: Stagnant emotion becomes depression. You don't need a gym. You need motion. A brisk walk while listening to an audiobook. A punching bag. A dance party in your living room for one song. Shake the pain out of your limbs.

3. Master the ""And"": This is the most powerful linguistic tool for your mind. ""I am heartbroken and I am capable."" ""I miss her and I will be okay."" ""This feels hopeless and I am going to cook myself a good meal tonight."" This stops one emotion from dominating your entire identity.

4. The Brotherhood Protocol: The ""compliment your friends"" advice was good. Let's level it up.

   · Vulnerability Bid: Text a friend: ""Man, having a rough week with the breakup. Can we grab a coffee?"" This is a direct ask for support.

   · The Gift of Presence: When with your friends, put your phone away. Look them in the eye. Listen to their problems. Being needed and useful is a powerful antidote to feeling worthless.

   · The Hug: Seriously. A full, 10-second, back-patting hug. It releases oxytocin and tells your nervous system you are safe. It is a direct counter to the trauma of abandonment.

The Unignorable Truth

79% of suicides are men. We die from swallowed pain.

Your feelings are not a liability. They are your internal navigation system. Ignoring them isn't strength; it's a slow-moving suicide. Feeling them, understanding them, and moving through them is the single most masculine thing you can do.

Someone left. A chapter ended. It hurts like hell because it mattered.

But you are not the relationship. You are the man who lived it, learned from it, and is now being forced to grow from it. Your mission is not to get her back or to make her regret it. Your mission is to build a man so solid, so self-aware, and so whole that when the right love does find you, you will be ready for it not as a missing half, but as a complete, powerful, and compassionate whole.

The world needs that man. You need that man.

Start building him today. We're all here, building alongside you.

Take care. Stay you. The best is yet to come.

1oxr9yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oxr9yj/aitah_for_getting_upset_about_this_work/,AITAH for getting upset about this work situation...(TLDR),"Yes, this is long, but I feel some background is needed before getting to the main part:

I was looking forward to starting a job, and moving on from a previous bad workplace (for instance, getting called the B-word by a boss and a smattering of other things).

When I started this job I was hoping for a fresh start and the boss and team lead made it sound fun and like a team environment in the interview. But when I got into the job it wasn't at all like what they made it sound like in the interview.

I had been struggling my first week; a male coworker had asked me to get him coffee multiple times (one of whom already had various HR reports filed against him from women in other departments), and asked me if I was ""looking for daddy"" when it was him and I alone one day. When I spoke with my boss his demeanor turned from relaxed to not relaxed and yelled at me while making the conversation about himself. I was frustrated because in the interview he mentioned if there were any issues to come and talk to him about it, but when I did all he did was make excuses. I should have quit there but I didn't. I tried to endure, but various other things followed after that; a male coworker pushing a cart into my hip,y. I should have also quit there, but I didn't. I didn't want to feel weak and I was really wanting this place to work out, regardless of the toll I already felt it taking. I also didn't have anything else lined up and was worried I wasn't going to be able to find another job, though I did start applying to a couple other places. However, I continued to stand my ground as I had goals I wanted to accomplish. Regardless of this behavior, he talked about me eventually taking his place as I had mentioned my goal of wanting to be in a leadership position one day. We started working on some things together in regard to that, even though he continued to treat me like crap (would use phrases like ""I don't remember that"" in meetings where we had just discussed something the week before - whether it was assigning me something or something he told me). He was also inconsistent with directions and never practiced what he preached...he was all over the place. 

Fast forward...they hire another female. At first I was happy that she was there. Sometime after this the boss hires two new coworkers. My boss and I had a conversation about me training the new people, which the newer coworker wasn't involved in. I would meet the other female coworker and he would meet up with the male coworker he had just hired. I was excited about the opportunity to do this and told her about it (shouldn't have done that). During this conversation she says in a statement like sentence that she needs to meet up with the female coworker and do the training, acting as if she was involved in the conversation. This same female coworker had also got upset at me when I asked about my progress one day (also had nothing to do with her), and accused me of wanting to make people feel bad. I'm like, ok..so I tone it down and reduce my excitement for anything and next thing I know my boss is saying I lost the twinkle in my eye and that I need to smile more.

Fast forward again...I realized I was struggling with peri-menopause and also started to feel some of the same, what seemed like stress induced symptoms, that I also started experiencing at my last place. Due to things happening in the workplace I was becoming more frustrated and irritable. However, It would be a few months before I could get into a doctor. My body was hurting (as a part of the job required lifting and a lot of walking). I was receiving chiropractic care.  Anyways, this female coworker and I were supposed to go on call around that same time (me first and her second). However, due to my symptoms other things that were happening I talked to my boss about quitting. He had convinced me to stay and ordered a better keyboard/mouse for my wrists (the best way to explain my pain was that I was feeling arthritic in my wrists, knees, hands and elbows). Being a female, I thought my female coworker would understand and I thought I was doing the right thing by giving her a heads up. She seemed ok with it and mentioned she had an event coming up. I wasn't sure what to do so I offered to talk to the boss about it. I did...""I'm like, hey...so and so has this event coming up and it is happening the week I was supposed to go on call before her"". He basically ignored it. Ok.

Fast forward again...the boss is gone during the week he swapped us. The team lead had apologized to the other coworker about having to switch things around. Ok, fair enough. However, I found out that she complained about it to another coworker (this same male coworker with the HR issues). During the meeting this male coworker goes on about how I should just take the phone and goes to comfort this other female coworker. Another male coworker tells him ""nobody cares about your..."" and then mentions that ""they should talk about this later"" (umm...they shouldn't have been talking about it at all). Just to note, I wasn't feeling well that morning and told myself that I should probably leave (peri-menopausal symptoms - A hot flash was coming on, I started to feel increased irritability and increased anxiousness over the situation). I decide to go and apologize to ease the tension....so I'm like ""hey I'm sorry, I talked to the boss about it"". She turns around and gets upset at me. I get upset and tell her then she needs to speak up for herself next time. I wasn't already feeling well and should have gone home, but I didn't. There were lots of things going through my mind. I was frustrated that I just didn't leave and put in my resignation to HR so the boss couldn't decline it. I was frustrated at the fact that the male coworker and her were talking about it, and frustrated that my health and asked for accommodations were apparently going to be discussed later. So, while I was back at my desk I decided to put in my resignation; I figured the boss wasn't there so he couldn't do anything about it (for at least that week). The team lead comes and asks if I want to talk about it. When we go into a separate room I kinda go off on him (or at least what I consider to be going off given that I have trouble with being assertive, but was trying to change that). I'm frustrated at...alllll the things. This team leads just starts making the conversation about him ""well I don't feel that way and other things in that general ""well I don't, well I don't...well you..."" direction"". This increased my frustration. I end up having what felt like a nervous breakdown.

I had packed my stuff and gone home. Later, I apologized to the team lead for taking up his time (even though he did ask if I wanted to talk about my putting in my resignation). He mentioned they still wanted me on the team, even though I never received a call from my boss about it and I was the one who had to call. When my boss gets back we have a conversation over the phone. I was working from home until he got back.  The first day he was ok. I find out that the team lead also lied to my boss about what happened, putting all the onus of responsibility on me and putting words in my mouth. The second conversation with my boss - he chastized me for things I said in the conversation in which was completely taken out of context. He refused to listen to my side of the story. I should have just not come back there, but I did.

When we were all back in the office my boss asked to speak with me and asked if I was ok. I had been telling him I wasn't..which was why I asked for accommodations in the first place. So I tell him that ""I have told you, I have been telling you"". He goes off on me and tells me to stop worrying about our problems. Right then and there I become confused as heck and I felt again that we were having two different conversations. He continues to yell at me even as I try to explain. At the end I'm just like ""just except my resignation"", which I also had to say a few times. It's also my understanding that he can't not accept my resignation (which would point back to the first time).

I end up getting in my car and leaving - crying and super mad on the way home (which wasn't far). Later, when I cooled down I texted me feeling coworker and told her that I was sorry to leave her hanging, but I had to get out of there (when the heck will I learn?).

It is hard not to feel like a hypocrite when I am lining thru life. This applies to many aspects of my life. Most notably: social. I am a person that loves to be alone. I adore it. I crave it. I need my daily dose of me time to function. At the same time I crave the attention and company of people. Rather a singular person. I can never actively participate in groups cuz the entire affair is so exhausting. I love talking to people and telling so much abt myself, if they heed me a listening year, at the same time I feel no one understands me. I am living a comfortable life yet still living in pain. I hate this pain but at the same time I seek it( not in any self-harm ways btw). I listen to sad songs or recreate sad scenarios just to feel that sadness. I feel it deeper than any other emotion. You must notice at this point that I am just ranting, but is there anyone that feels the same way as I do?

Or with friends or family. To get sex it’s like pulling teeth so I feel I am going to pull back and watch it all burn down.

1oxr2qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1oxr2qs/how_to_improve_sales_of_fbads_advice/,How to Improve Sales of fbads [ADVICE],"Hi pals I have a question and would like some advice. I sell specialty Pacamará and Geisha coffee beans with a tasting score between 85-89 out of 100, which means it is very good. My end market is Europe, but I have a small batch available for national or local sale. In my local market, there is a variety of coffees with a range of prices, and the cheapest ones are on average 250 grams for about $1.66. There are competitors, for example, Nestlé's Nescafé instant coffee, 160 grams for about $13.30, and my coffee costs 250 grams for about $10; so 

* competitive prices
* high quality compared to a commercial instant product. 

With this data, I decided to launch advertising campaigns on Meta with a 

* sales target and a CBO budget of $7 per day, 
* with two ad sets with open audiences of 25-64+ 2 geografical location, 
* with five video and image ads, 
* all leading to wazap messages.

This has been running for a week, and now my starting numbers are as follows:

1. amount spent from 7/11 to 14/11 = 42.64 USDT
2. impressions = 51,849
3. reach = 24,652
4. CTR = 4.75%
5. CPC = 0.02
6. results = 372
7. CPC = 0.07
8. CPM = 0.82
9. total final sales= 12 units 3.23%.

I believe the reason the sales conversion rate is so low is because it is a new brand that is not well known, and I fully believe that the problem is brand recognition or value ladder or perception of value. One of the solutions I have thought of is 

1. creating valuable organic content on Meta and TikTok
2. Having a web platform to close sales and no longer using Wazap, something like WordPress WooCommerce or Shopify, Etsy, or better... I don't know if there is a platform on Meta where you can make sales directly with a payment platform. The truth is that I don't want to invest a lot of time in creating an e-commerce site for just 1 product on WooCommerce or an onlinestore that requires a monthly subscription fee. I would like something simple where I can focus on creating content and advertising campaigns.

1oxr1op,https://i.redd.it/je7ks03m4f1g1.jpeg,These things drive me fucking insane and it’s insane how they are allowed to even be produced,"I rant about machines and waste and how we interact with things on here a lot. There is so much evil in this world, and evil machines in this world, but none get me as acutely mad as a fucking keurig. Yeah there’s no ethical consumption under capitalism yada yada yada but if you have one of these it’s hard to not think of you as a stupid knuckle dragging pig for slop. 

You can’t be fucking bothered to *make coffee?* a paper filter and the grounds you can literally just toss in the grass?

If you put any amount of thought into these machines, from any angle, the waste it generates just multiplies in a manner that is just fucking grotesque. Here. Really take a second and think about these things for 30 seconds and think about the waste these cups make. Ok. Here’s one I just thought of today after seeing one for the first time in a while. Imagine how much *wasted space* there is in the fucking *air* that exists in and between each one of these round disposable cups when shipping. Even if they are light any kind of freight can only move so much volume. They are making waste before they are even in your kitchen or office. 

I think it’s fitting that you sort of load a lot of these almost like a [break barrel shotgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_action). Using these things just feels like loading up a fucking slug into a 12 gauge and just blasting. Shooting for shootings sake. The shell gets loaded and that little firing pin comes down into the k-cup but instead of gunpowder exploding and blasting out the end of a Remington, some horrible acid drips down into your cup and you drink it. And it seeps into your brain. Maybe this shell doesn’t kill you like a lead slug but it still does. Them sweet sweet microplastics fill in the gaps and quiet the synapses in your brain that might make you pause and ask what in our society over the last 30 years took me from thinking about “reduce, reuse, recycle?” Having each SINGLE CUP OF COFFEE generate plastic waste instead of compostable material is *progress!* it’s *futuristic!* 

They fire a shotgun at our brain every morning, from our own homes. But it’s not violence. The only difference between them coffee grinds and a slug is who it threatens. ",144,1763211360.0,TrueAnon,75,0.94,False

Akari leaned against her counter made of reclaimed live-edge wood with butterfly joints in her white tank top and waxed canvas apron. She sipped an umami-rich gyokuro and leafed through a culinary magazine for the feature on her very own 'Japanese Style Cafe', the narrow shop pictured nestled between the bank and bulk goods store. And she tried her best not to cry. Not about the feature, but her whole afternoon. It was just one thing after another, lately. She alone had made the decision to leave, to do this by herself, and yet she felt abandoned. He'd been more concerned about the cat, than anything.

Then earlier today, someone had left in a huff over her refusal to over-water an espresso. He dropped a handful of silver change into a tip jar she clearly kept full of larger coins and folded bills, and she made him fish it all out again, thank-you-very-much. Wished him a lovely day once he slammed the glass door on his way out. Kicked the counter a little, and noticed a handsome unflinching mallard, staring. Its emerald head and broad shoulders. How the curve in its beak lent to its expression the appearance of a smirk, almost.

At first she pretended not to notice. Busied herself wiping down the counter and adjusting her flowering pothos. Stacking paper cups. And it watched her. When a customer arrived, she frowned her way through the preparation of a flat white. Felt the mallard's eyes crawl the tattoos up her arms in search of its hidden likeness, its glossy black eyes getting warmer and warmer, while she measured the grounds by weight, pressed them into the portafilter, allowed the musculature of her slender arms to ripple tamping the espresso into a perfect puck. When it came to steaming and frothing the milk, she could judge the foam by sound and feel, by the hiss of her wand and the temperature of the stainless steel pitcher, so she could hardly be blamed for meeting the mallard's eyes again. And over the shoulder of a customer who requested a venti, she even risked a smile, as if through the window the mallard understood, but could only hold it a moment before blushing away. It was stupid, the blushing, like a teenager. And yet, alone again, upon making a coffee for herself, she this time braced herself to hold the mallard's gaze. She dipped the steam wand into a swirl of creamy, velvety microfoam, and hardly blinked. And neither did the duck. Even once the drink was made she didn't look away, instead stepped out from behind the machine to be observed, finding herself slowly slipping the left strap of her tank top down her arm. She exposed her left breast, and the drake tattooed there.

The duck moved to the door and presented itself, and she straightened, bit her lip, covered her breast and nodded. But when she crossed the space to invite the duck in, it waddled away.

She would not chase it down, not again. Instead she spent the day cradling her face over the magazine, imagining lines in the article that depicted her lonely lusting after ducks. Still, steam rose from her tea, and palming a tear from her eye she saw the mallard was back again.

Only briefly did she consider putting up a fight, then hurried to the door. She flipped her sign--*what are you doing, Akari, they want only to use you and always you let them!*\--and followed the duck into the back room.",1,1763211135.0,DestructiveReaders,1,0.67,False

When we met he had been separated for a year, and was due to file for legal divorce. His ex had been giving him a hard time & he talked to me openly about it so we were connecting on a emotional level too as well as building trust. 

However, when things escalated (she threatened to apply for sole custody if he didn't pay her more money) he never asked me to support him through the difficult time but suggested a break. I agreed to it given things were quite new and I wanted him to focus on his son instead of adding to his stress. 

It all happened so fast that we never set any rules for the break. I do not intend to see anyone else and I know he doesn't have the bandwidth or time to also. However, a month after the break started I went through something traumatic with my family & really wanted some support.

Dear Self— 

It’s finally Day “nth” of no contact. As you write this on one fine rainy evening, in the cafe’s alfresco while the world drifts in a sea of people, the Universe decides to be tricky with its sense of humor and mixed signals. A couple passed by not once, but twice, with the young lady holding the exact bouquet of pink flowers that someone had given you months ago. How familiar it felt, and how it ached all the same.

Was it a sign to break the rule? Or a delicate whisper of closure? Perhaps we aren’t meant to know. What we do know is this: love is never meant to be uncertain, nor inconsistent, nor quietly chaotic. More so, your capacity to love shouldn’t be left in the night’s silence. 

And until then, when love finds me again, l hope it’s the kind of love that is sincere, emotionally aware, and
eager to build something real through steady effort. It comes from
souls who value emotional depth and see warmth as a space of
comfort and grounding. 

A connection that is patient but intentional, seeking a bond rooted in honesty, understanding, and shared growth.

It’s not a fleeting attraction but a meeting of hearts that want to
learn from one another.

A love that wants to give as much
as it receives, guided by emotional maturity and genuine care. 

A kind of connection that may start quietly, developing through consistency rather than intensity, but it carries lasting potential. 

It values communication, trust, and mutual respect. A love that is drawn to
mirror the tenderness and wisdom you’ve cultivated—it seeks
harmony, devotion, and the kind of partnership that grows stronger
through empathy, honesty, and shared emotional truth.

Until a love worthy of your softness finds its way back to you, you’ll wander through a few more solo flights—quiet journeys meant only for your own becoming. You’ll linger in cafés with nothing but your thoughts and the steady comfort of your own company, sipping warm coffee as strangers drift past like fleeting stories. And in those gentle pauses, you’ll remember that even in your aloneness, you are still moving, still growing, still beautifully alive.

**Presentation**

**Carlos de Alba**  
*Morgan Stanley, Research Division*

This last session of the Mining Symposium on Critical Minerals and rare earths. It is a pleasure to host NioCorp. Mark Smith is Executive Chairman, President and CEO. And we also have Jim Sims in the forum. We're going to keep it hopefully very conversational. You can also meet questions via the Zoom app. We will read it once we get it for Mark or Jim to answer. But before we begin, please let me mention some disclaimers. Please note that this webcast is for Morgan Stanley clients and select employees or appropriate employees, I should say. This webcast is not for members of the press.

And if you are a member of the press, please disconnect and reach out separately. For important disclosures, please see the Morgan Stanley research disclosure website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. And if you have any questions, please reach out to your Morgan Stanley sales representative. All right. So with that out of the way, Mark, the -- we're going to just keep it conversational, as I said, we have some questions, \[ Mark \] and I and then as the audience starts to send theirs, we'll also ask them to answer those, please. Maybe just to set the stage and before I pass it on to Mark, would you just present a brief introduction of the company, a little bit of the history, and then we kick it off from there.

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Very good, Carlos. And again, thank you -- and \[ Mark \] for this wonderful opportunity. I think this will be the only slide that we use for the presentation today, but it's such a great slide in terms of summarizing what our company is and what we're doing. If we take a look at the upper left-hand corner here, this really summarizes it very, very well. We are trying to put together the technical plans, the construction plans and the financing for a $1.2 billion underground mine and surface processing facility located in the very southeast corner of the state of Nebraska. We will be mining and producing products, including niobium, titanium, scandium and the magnetic rare earth oxides. I would like to point out very quickly that the United States imports, 100% of the niobium it needs today. It imports about 85% of the titanium that it needs today.

It imports 100% of the scandium that it needs today, and it imports very close to 100% of the magnetic rare earth oxides, although MP Materials is certainly ramping up on the NdPr, the neodymium praseodymium right now, and congratulations to them for that. So these are very, very important strategic elements for the country, and it's time to bring some onshore production of these minerals to the United States. We are traded on the NASDAQ ticker symbol NB. We'll go down to the lower row on the blue box on the lower right -- lower left, sorry, and note that we have 0 debt, 0 outstanding convertible notes. Going to the company highlights section, the green box, lower right, we've raised almost $371 million this year, including a $10 million Pentagon grant that we got that's been very, very useful for the company.

We have all of our permits in hand. There is no permitting risk associated with this project. And once the financing is finalized, we've got a 36-month construction time period to get to production. Unbelievable strong state and local support for this project. We hold town halls in the area, 500-plus people come out to these town halls. We have 0 protesters, 0 naysayers. We have really worked hard to earn that trust in the community. That's our social license to operate. We're going to work hard to maintain that social license. All the other things on here, I think we can probably just let the viewers read those on their own. But hopefully, that gives a pretty good high-level view of what this company is about and what we're trying to undertake.

**Question-and-Answer Session**

**Unknown Analyst**

Great. Thank you, Mark. I guess let's double-click a little bit here on the actual site itself and the time line that you guys have outlined for the commercial production here. Let's just break that down a little bit and what you could foresee as being some of the bottlenecks or governors to hitting that target.

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Great question, \[ Mark \]. And of course, in the United States, we have to ask that question constantly in the mining industry. As we all saw early in the year, there was a report that came out that suggested it takes, on average, 29 years to get a mine into production. So I will tell you that I've been working on this NioCorp project for over 12 years. I'm happy to report that we are very, very close to seeing the finish line and being able to start construction. In terms of items that we're looking to accomplish in the next few months here, as we noted just a moment ago, we've really had some very good success raising equity funds for the project financing. We also have worked for 2 years and 4 months with the Export-Import Bank of the United States. We think that we're probably sometime in 2026, going to see the final results of that effort. It's a very long tenuous effort. But as taxpayers, we, of course, want them to protect U.S. taxpayer money. So we're fine with the level of due diligence, but we have been in this process and XM is talking about a $780 million loan.

So we're very, very close to having the full project financing that we need to start construction. The rest of that then goes to how prepared are we for construction itself because once you raise the money, then the hard part really starts. -- you've got a $1.2 billion construction project, you have to be on time and you have to be on budget. So what we've been doing with the $300-plus million we have in treasury is we're advancing the project as we speak today. We're clearing the shrubs, clearing the trees. We've bought all the property, the surface and the mineral rights that we need. We're getting all those little things behind us to make sure they don't cause delays in our schedule or upset our budget in any way. So we're really moving forward. This is based on 44 years of experience in the business. I know exactly what can go wrong. And so we're trying to address those things upfront and just get them behind us. And I'm really, really pleased with the level of effort that our employees have put into advancing this project today. It's really remarkable.

**Unknown Analyst**

Got you. And do you foresee any constraints, be it on account of labor availability or just general infrastructure in the region? Help me kind of think about the site's location a little bit more.

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Yes. Infrastructure in the region, let me start there. There's natural gas pipelines very close to the site. There's electrical power very close to the site. We're working with the local power provider for the community and have meetings with them once a week right now to make sure we get those lines into the site. As is always the case in very big power demand situations, we have to discuss those things. That puts a huge burden on their system. So again, just that open, honest conversation we started very early on and we're meeting once a week with them right now. So infrastructure, I'm very confident that all of that is going to be in place.

And the point that we want to make is, again, advancing the project on an early basis like we are because we have cash in the bank, that allows us to start early on those infrastructure efforts and make sure that they're there on time. If something goes wrong, we have plan B and plan C and plan D. So I'm not losing any sleep over infrastructure, but those are big, big power projects to bring on to the site. In terms of -- let's see, the other part that you'd asked about, \[ Mark \], I apologize. I got so tied up on infrastructure.

**Unknown Analyst**

Oh, just labor availability...

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Oh, labor, yes. No, great question. First of all, the people in Southeast Nebraska I think, are super supportive of this project because they're looking forward to the very high-paying mining and surface mineral processing jobs that we're going to have out there, probably 450 to 500 full-time positions out there. So we've got a huge interest level already. But I'll also say that our 2 EPC contractors that we're using have capabilities that can add to that and make sure that we bridge ourselves from going from 0 to 500 employees quite easily. So Zachry will be our EPC contractor for the aboveground facility. They keep a workforce of over 22,000 people available for construction projects and you can hire them on a contract basis just to go right into operations while you're bridging that issue if you need to. Same on the underground mining side.

We've got Dumas, who will be developing the underground mine for us. We have every intention to just keep them on as the underground mining entity on a contract basis because underground mining is different than surface mining. And the one thing you figure out after being in the mining industry as long as I have, and you've seen both surface in situ, underground, I've seen every type of mining there is. There are certain people in the world that really like underground mining. And there's a lot of people that don't. And there's no in between. I mean you either like it or you don't. And so to make sure that we have that issue addressed, we've already talked to Dumas about providing the contract mining for us. So again, not losing any sleep over either one of those issues, but very, very good question, \[ Mark \].

**Unknown Analyst**

Perfect. Maybe let's shift back to the financing here and address a question from the web. And again, I'd invite everybody on the webcast to please submit your questions. They're all great here. Maybe if you could provide us with an update on your equity raise. Are we finished with the share dilution? And how much additional dilution might be necessary to get where project cash flows start financing the operation?

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Yes. I've been really tried for the 12-plus years that I've been running NioCorp to make sure that all of our shareholders from day 1 until now understand that by definition, we are going to have dilution. We have to raise more equity. We are maximizing the amount of debt that the project can deliver here, and XM has done a great job of figuring out what that debt level is. They're going to give us a 65% debt level on this project, a little higher than some normal projects and certainly higher than a lot of projects today. And a lot of that comes from the fact that we have 4 basic product streams coming out of there that can ultimately produce 11 or 12 different products into different markets and the earnings and cash flow from that commercial operation look fantastic, which then bumps the ability to take on the debt.

But we still have to raise equity for the project. There is going to be additional fundraising. I've been very forthright about that. We don't know how much because we're in final discussions, so to speak, with XM on what they want for debt service reserve accounts, what they want for cost overrun facilities. All of these add to the necessity for either raising that money and equity finding lines of credit to support those facilities. We're still putting all of those pieces together, but we have to know the amount that XM is wanting to see. We were supposed to meet with them a couple of weeks ago to start those conversations. Obviously, with the government shutdown, that meeting didn't occur. Happy to report we're headed back out there next week. We're not wasting any time. We're going to get right into it with XM. I want a binding something from XM as soon as humanly possible.

**Carlos de Alba**  
*Morgan Stanley, Research Division*

And Mark, I would like to bring the conversation back a little bit to the company operations of the company. Can you maybe provide a little bit more color on the characteristics, details of the deposit? What is the distribution of elements? You mentioned that you're going to be able to produce several of the critical minerals and rare earths that the world is so dependent on China. Can you maybe flesh out a little bit the distribution of those elements, the proportion and what is going to be more relevant for the revenue generation?

Yes. Happy to do that, Carlos, and it's a great opportunity to make sure everybody on the call here knows that information. So we're going to be, as I mentioned earlier, we'll be producing niobium titanium, scandium and the magnetic rare earths. So the niobium is really our primary product that we're going after. This is really -- it's a carbonatite deposit that has a very good ore grade for niobium. It's upwards of 0.8%, 0.82% and as we just announced in the results from the #2 drill hole that we put out there to do some infill drilling, we had the best drill results that we'd ever had. Full mineralization in the entire carbonatite section that we drilled, and we saw some of the highest continuous ore grades for niobium that we've seen, well over 1%, which then puts us into potentially a #2 category instead of #3 in terms of some of the best ore for a niobium project that's under development right now.

So we're very pleased with the niobium ore grades we're seeing, and we've got the metallurgy figured out just beautifully right now in terms of how to recover that niobium at very high recovery levels, upwards of 90-plus percent for recovering the niobium. Also in the carbonatite deposit, we have titanium, very common to see niobium and titanium in the same resources. We've figured out how to separate the titanium from the niobium. And under the new process flow diagram, we'll be producing 6x the amount of titanium that we note in our 2022 feasibility study. So that will be updated here as we're updating our feasibility study again with the new process flow diagram, but we've got excellent separation between the titanium and niobium now. We're going to be producing scandium as well. And scandium, keep in mind, the scandium titanium and the magnetic rare earths, in our view, are byproducts for the mine. Scandium will be producing at about 100 tonnes per year.

That's probably 3x what the market size is in terms of what's produced basically out of China today. But we are very confident about the latent market demand associated with that scandium. And we are working with, as we just announced also companies like Lockheed Martin on uses and ways to sell the scandium oxide. So they've got a new technology that will help our fighter jets be safer and yet more lethal at the same time. That requires scandium to undertake that change in technology. So we're thrilled with that. And we have other OEM programs that we're working on with automobile manufacturers where we'll replace current parts that are made with 100% aluminum with scandium aluminum and potentially scandium recycled aluminum, which has all kinds of win-win attributes associated with it. And then finally, the magnetic rare earths. And we're able to actually selectively produce the rare earths that we want because we start our metallurgical process with a full hydromet.

So we're putting everything into solution and then we can selectively remove the rare earths that we want. And having been in the rare earth industry for 38-plus years, I can't tell you how nice this is to be in this position because I've always been in a position where you didn't have the capability of selectively producing what you want. And so you end up producing a lot of cerium and a lot of lanthanum before you ever get to the minerals, the rare earths that have value. 90-plus percent of the value of any rare earth ore body today is associated with these magnetic rare earths. Well, we're in the very luxurious position of being able to put everything in solution and then selectively remove that 90-plus percent of the value of the rare earths in our ore body.

And we have the very good fortune with this carbonatite geologic resource of having both bastnaesite and monazite in our ore body, which then allows us to pick up and produce the dysprosium and the terbium all the way to high-purity oxide form. So hopefully, that helps a little bit. And then we -- just to add to that, particularly on the scandium side, there are so many things that we need to bring onshore in the United States here. I mean, first of all, scandium, we don't produce any scandium in the United States today, nor do we produce scandium metal to speak of. We don't produce any of the scandium aluminum alloy of any amount that makes any difference. NioCorp is working on all of those supply chain issues as well, and we hope to have some announcements here in the next near future about efforts that we're undertaking to make sure that, that scandium supply chain is fully onshore in the United States. We're very excited to do that. But a few details we have to work out before we can announce it.

**Carlos de Alba**  
*Morgan Stanley, Research Division*

All right. And one more here on the company's operations before I pass it back to \[ Mark \]. Can you give us a little bit of information, color on the Elk Creek time line from where you are now to commercial production?

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Yes. And remember that I am the Chief Executive Officer. And as I like to tell everybody, I'm also the Chief Cheerleading Officer. And so I'm always going to be very optimistic about what we're doing here. And I also have enough experience in the field to know that sometimes my optimistic views take a little bit longer than what we hope. But I think what I'm about to talk about is pretty realistic because we've been working on so many of these things for so long, and we can actually see the light at the end of the tunnel. So the really big issue that's hanging over us right now is we've got to get the XM loan to be binding and get it to final form. That needs to be fully approved by the XM Board of Directors. And again, we've been working on that loan process for 2 years and 4 months. And I really feel like we're narrowing down on the last few items that we need to agree to with them, and we're narrowing down on the technical work that XM wanted to see enhanced in order for them to issue us the loan.

So that process is coming together. I don't see any reason right now why that process can't come to conclusion in the U.S. government's fiscal year 2026. So what that means in layman's terms is on or before September 30, 2026, we should have that XM loan in place. We do need to raise a little more equity or some form of additional financing to support the non-debt piece of the project financing. I don't see that as a particular problem either with as much money as we have in the bank right now, the interest level in this project is extremely high. We'll raise the extra money. And again, that should all be able to happen sometime between now and when the XM loan process is finished. What that means then is project financing should come to a conclusion in 2026.

We have a 3-year construction schedule, but don't forget, we're doing a whole bunch of things right now that are part of that construction schedule. But I'll just leave it at 3 years, which means we should start production in 2029. And we've given ourselves about a 6-month period to ramp up from commissioning to full nameplate capacity production at the site. Once we start production, though, so before we hit nameplate capacity, we will be producing minerals. And our offtake contract partners want those minerals sent to them as soon as they're produced and as soon as they meet a reasonable level of product specification. So we'll start generating revenues very quickly at the conclusion of construction. And we have all of our permits in place. So financing is in place, here we go.

**Unknown Analyst**

So I guess, Mark, if we could, I mean, let's just double-click a little bit more on the XM funding. A question here from the web that as you'd mentioned, you expect sometime in fiscal '26. In the past, I guess, you'd expected the process to likely end by end of '25 due to the parallel XM process moving along simultaneously with the feasibility study and social impact study. So maybe if you could narrow down that time line a little bit more? Should we be thinking more towards the second half of fiscal '26? Or is it closer to the original projection?

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Again, let me start by saying, remember, I'm also the Chief Cheerleading Officer. So I continue to push these things and push these things as hard as I can because like everyone else, I'm major shareholder in this company as well. And the sooner we can start construction, the sooner we can start production, the sooner we start revenues for this company. So I want the exact same thing that every shareholder out there wants. Sometimes we don't understand priorities in the government as well as we need to understand them. And there is very little control that we ultimately have over XM in terms of how fast they move in their process. They had pointed out to us in 2024, some technical work items that they wanted to have done to advance their loan evaluation process. We had revised our process flow diagram, unbelievable metallurgical results from that, very well proven out at a full feasibility study level with over 2 weeks of continuous operation at a demonstration plant.

I couldn't be happier with the metallurgy. But as we knew would happen, XM wanted to have that metallurgical process put up to FEL 3 or feasibility study level engineering. That work started at the end of April of this year. It will be done by the end of this calendar year. That will be available for XM to do their due diligence on. That will not take very long. Their technical due diligence contractor has already reviewed everything from a 2019 feasibility, everything from a 2022 feasibility study. This will be a very easy technical review for them to get through, but that has to be done. Second item that they wanted was we had all of our geological reserves classified as probable reserves and XM wanted to have proven reserves. And so we did discuss that with them for quite some period of time because that was very extraordinary.

Most of the commercial banks in the world are very happy with probable reserves in order to finance projects, but XM wanted proven reserves. So we agreed and we undertook an infill drilling program, which we started late April of this year as well. All the holes have been drilled. The rigs are demobed and off-site. All we're doing now is waiting for the analytical results to come back in from that effort. Remember that there were 7,700 samples taken from the 13 holes that we put in the ground, and all of those have to be analyzed. So we've got 2 of the 13 holes done already. We anticipate all of the analytical work to be back in by about mid-December. Then we give the geologists about 30 days to run through all of their models. And the goal that we're trying to achieve on behalf of XM to make their final decision is they want at least 10 years of proven reserves. I have absolutely 0 worries about us not hitting that 10 years.

And I have reason to believe because the geologists that are doing the work actually have offices about 25 feet away from my office. I might be over in their office quite often every day. And I have reason to believe that we're going to hit that target with absolute flying colors. So that is ongoing. And this next week, when we meet with XM, we'll update them with the specifics on that, but that issue is not going to be an issue going forward either. So then it boils down to 2 final things that we have to undertake for XM. Offtake agreements, which we're working on, and we're working on both individual company offtake agreements, we're also looking at a much larger general offtake agreement with a single party. And it's going to be whoever comes first in time is going to get this contract for offtake because we don't have a whole lot of time to finish discussions on this anymore.

XM is ready to act as soon as we have those offtake agreements in place. So we're very focused on that. And then the final issue, which we've already talked about a lot, is they just want to make sure that all the equity is going to be there before they finalize the loan. But needless to say, with the $370-plus million we've raised in 2025, they've verbally indicated to us their confidence level in our ability to meet the full amount is as high as it's going to be. So we're very good in every category. I think the market is going to like when they hear more on the offtake side because that means XM advances that much faster. But I don't see any reason at all why this cannot be completed in 2026. And certainly, when we talk to all of our advisers, when we talk to XM themselves, there's an awful lot of head nodding as we talk about these dates. So I'm confident we're going to hit that.

**Unknown Analyst**

Got you. Maybe just a follow-up to that. Let's double-click a little bit on the offtake agreements themselves. What do you expect them to look like? And what should investors look out for by the end of this year, end of '26? And then a follow-up question from the web. respecting a lot of the progress here, we're looking to make sort of still hinges on XM, is there any sort of a backup or contingency plan there if it's denied or deferred any further?

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Let me start with the second question first, \[ Mark \], because I think it's a great question. And one of the things that we've made -- tried to establish a very good reputation for is to have plan A through how many plans we can. And one of those sub plans for the debt side has been we started talking to commercial debt providers 5, 6 years ago. Once we became eligible for the XM process, it became evident to us and the commercial lenders that we were talking to that it was going to be very hard for the commercial lenders to compete with that cost of capital. And so we've kept them on the sidelines, very warm. We give them updates to our project whenever anything significant happens. And so we've kind of got 3 commercial banks sitting out there still very interested in the project, but they know they can't really compete with the XM cost of capital. So yes, we have other plans sitting out there.

I'd also add that there are multiple government agencies in the U.S., which can also provide additional funding here either in concert with XM or separately. All of those have really become fully funded. And for the most part, they're becoming operational now. The Office of Strategic Capital, DFC, those are 2 that I can point to that are very, very directed by the White House to get this critical strategic minerals effort onshore into the United States. So those would also be considered back up. Jim and I have had multiple meetings with those agencies as well to make sure they know who we are, what we're doing. They obviously want to be very careful that they don't cross over into the XM area unnecessarily.

So we're trying to hold all of those conversations very carefully, but very strategically. There's also the market that we can go to. I've been watching the convertible debt market in particular right now. And it's something like I've never seen in 20-plus years of doing financing. I've never seen a convertible market that is this attractive right now. So our goal is to make sure that we put together the best financing package at the lowest cost capital possible because that's what makes a difference to our shareholders and their ultimate value in this company. So we're being very open-minded about it, but we have gone a long ways down the road with XM. I have no intentions of throwing that away and starting fresh again with other folks.

**Unknown Analyst**

Got you. I guess let's take it back up now a little bit more towards the operations itself and some of the opportunities. But do you anticipate any future partnerships with other parts of the midstream or downstream processes to really kind of help vertically integrate and secure that domestic supply chain?

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Yes. Great question, \[ Mark \]. And it allows us to once again kind of talk about our culture. There are some entities out there, very small entities sometimes and a little larger entities other times that can do some of these onshore supply chain pieces. And we are not an aggressive company that goes in and takes over companies and does hostile M&A, we do things cooperatively. And so we're -- what we want to make sure that we do for the United States is to put together the whole supply chain where it needs to be put together because other people are not working on it. We want to put that together, but we'll do that in partnership. We'll do that in a JV. We'll do that in an acquisition. I mean it's whatever makes the best sense for us and the other company that we're working for. But we're not going to do anything hostile. We're doing this for purpose, and that's to onshore these supply chain activities. So the United States government is assured that we can do these things and not have to worry about export licenses or decisions on whether things can be sent to the United States or not.

**Unknown Analyst**

Got you. And then maybe also while we're on it, let's double-click again on the Lockheed deal there and kind of help me understand a little bit more the scandium alloy market and respective to its current size, where do you see the opportunity set? And what are the advantages this alloy kind of brings to market?

**Mark Smith**  
*Executive Chairman, President & CEO*

Thank you for that question. This is one where hopefully, we'll get finished here in the next 45 minutes or so, \[ Mark \]. This is one I'm going to go on. So scandium aluminum alloy and just looking at it by itself compared to aluminum, and that's kind of what you want to look at it for. And the way I kind of like to look at scandium with aluminum is just to kind of think about what niobium does for steel. It's a grain refiner, you end up with something that weighs less. It's significantly stronger, much more corrosion resistant, much more heat resistant on both cold and hot. And then scandium does almost the exact same thing to aluminum. It makes it ultimately lighter, makes it significantly stronger, makes it weldable. It has much better corrosion resistance to it and a much wider temperature span that it can operate under. So it does a lot of very good things. It just -- there's just never been enough supply there.

And so all the technologies that people have that can utilize scandium have basically just been put on a shelf because there wasn't enough supply there. NioCorp can change that to a very large degree. And the part that you always interests me when we're talking to potential scandium offtake partners is they come to realize, and maybe we help them a little bit on this, but they come to realize that we're not a primary scandium producer. We're there for niobium. And as long as we're producing niobium, we necessarily produce scandium. They like that extra advantage that they have, that extra surety that they have that scandium will actually be produced. And because it is a byproduct, our economics with scandium are going to be very different than a primary producer. So it really creates many advantages for us. But in terms of other applications because I think the big issue with scandium has been it's such an opaque market.

There's only 20 to maybe 30 tons produced in the world today. You can Google scandium. And when I did it 7 or 8 years ago, you would find prices that ranged anywhere from $3,500 a kilogram to $12,000 a kilogram. If you Google it today, you'll find prices that are kind of right around $700 a kilogram to $3,500 a kilogram. And what you're seeing there is that this is the basic China MO again where they see the advantages of scandium. They understand that they are the major producer of scandium today. They're trying to capture that market share. I've seen this go through at least 3 cycles on the rare earth space, and we're just seeing it again on scandium. So what they've been doing is dropping the prices of scandium to keep all the other producers out, capturing more and more market. That's not something that bothers us.

I mean, don't get me wrong. I want to make sure we get the right value for our scandium. But our price to produce that doesn't create a problem like it does for a primary scandium producer. So we can hang in there pretty good with the Chinese for a long period of time, and we plan to do so. And in the meantime, we're developing -- we're working with the people who will actually use scandium and developing those applications to make sure that people know that we are going to produce 100 tons per year. You can move forward with these efforts that include the scandium or scandium aluminum alloys. One of the -- we've talked about Lockheed a little bit. That's a very exciting opportunity for us and unbelievable what it will do for our pilots. We're also working on another project over in the U.K. called Project PIVOT.

And we have Aston Martin, Jaguar Land Rover, Boeing U.K. as kind of the end users in this Project PIVOT group. But we have NioCorp as a future scandium supplier. We have the extruders. We have the casting companies. We have the aluminum companies. And what we're looking at over there is taking recycled aluminum adding a little bit of scandium to it. And what you end up with is an alloy that is equal to or better than the aluminum that you would use if you used fresh or green aluminum in that application. Well, these car companies are ecstatic about this because you do end up with an alloy that has equal to or better than the properties of the aluminum. The cost of recycled aluminum is 70%, 7-0 percent less than buying fresh aluminum, so they get a lower cost part. And then one of the best things that the U.K. manufacturers like is that when you use recycled aluminum in this process, you get a 96% reduction in your CO2 emission profile associated with that part.

And that means that converting the aluminum parts in these automobiles to scandium recycled aluminum parts, that will be their largest single reduction in CO2 emissions corporate-wide, and they are still committed to their CO2 emission targets that they've put out publicly. So this is a win-win-win for the OEMs over in the U.K. And our -- we can't wait to finalize all those project efforts and get all the final data and enter into offtake agreements with those parties. Our biggest concern is we're only producing 100 tons. If we start talking about the likes of Ford or GM that might want to do this down the road, we're going to have to produce a lot more scandium. That's a good problem to have. So we're looking forward to that.

# Conclusion:

# “NioCorp: No Hype, Just Hard Facts — Mark Confirms the 2026 Launch Path”

IMHO\~ During the presentation, Mark Smith reiterated that NioCorp’s operational and financing plan remains fully intact, with the EXIM Bank process moving forward but still working through formal federal timelines. ***He clarified that EXIM is in the “due diligence → final credit review” transition phase***, and although he mentioned September 2026 as a possible outside estimate, it was framed as a regulatory-driven timeline, not an internal delay. ***His tone and detail strongly suggested that the company continues to work toward a much earlier Final Investment Decision (FID) than that worst-case bracket!***

On the technical side, Mark confirmed that all infill holes have been drilled, assays are in progress, and final results should be completed in MID-December 2025. **He noted the early data “looks fantastic” (as stated previously by Jim Sims), reinforcing expectations that the expanded resource case remains strong. However, he did not release new assays at the event, sticking to previously announced timelines and leaving investors to anticipate additional results in the coming weeks.**

Finally, Mark emphasized that NioCorp enters 2026 with a clean balance sheet—over $360M cash, no major debt pressures, and clear visibility toward construction once EXIM and strategic offtakes are finalized. The absence of breaking news today was disappointing to traders, but Mark’s remarks confirmed that the core catalysts—EXIM approval, updated resource model, DFS update, offtakes, and construction mobilization—remain lined up for 2026. If even one of these drops early (e.g., assays or an EXIM milestone), the stock could see a sharp reversal given current oversold sentiment.

**\*\*\*And here’s the part everyone should be paying attention to:** the final drill assays have the potential to become *the single most important catalyst* NioCorp has released in a decade. **If** remaining holes confirm what Mark and Sims have already hinted *(“they look fantastic”*), we’re staring at a realistic path to **1,000,000+ tonnes TREO in the ground** — a resource expansion that would rewrite the entire valuation model. A confirmed million-tonne TREO inventory doesn’t just strengthen the DFS… it transforms NioCorp from a specialty metals project into a full-spectrum rare earth supplier with strategic depth the U.S. government *cannot ignore*. At that point, EXIM funding becomes a formality, off-takes multiply, vertical-integration partners jockey for position, and every short still leaning on this thing gets steamrolled. These assays aren’t just data — they’re the matchstick. Once they drop, the entire narrative flips from “waiting” to **“undervalued national asset with explosive upside!”**

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

Question:
Will full-height vertical inlays glued into the edge cause wood-movement issues over time?
Or is this an acceptable way to clean up the edges when the boards aren’t perfectly the same thickness?

For finishing: the back will get a quick 80-grit belt sander cleanup, and the front will be sanded to 220, with both sides sealed using BLO.

I'm looking for an experience-base gift to give him during the trip. We'll spend one week in Melbourne, one in Sidney, one on a roadtrip from Sidney to Brisbane then one last week around Cairns.

Is there something particularly memorable that you have done during your trip? Like an exceptional guided tour, or snorkeling experience, or something?

We both enjoy swimming so I was thinking I'd book some kind of snorkeling tour in Cairns. Any recommandations?

Or maybe tickets to a concert at Sidney Opera House. Is that worth it?

We're also huge foodies and he's a coffee snob, a food-related experience, like an exceptional restaurant or a cooking course we couldn't get elsewhere would be great.

I'm brainstorming here, open to all ideas :) I really want to do something memorable but I don't know much about Australia. Thank you so much :)",1,1763210217.0,AustraliaTravel,1,1.0,False

1oxqkiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/newproductsamazon/comments/1oxqkiq/how_does_a_puzzle_board_compare_to_a_lap_desk/,How does a puzzle board compare to a lap desk?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting into jigsaw puzzles lately, and I ran into this annoying problem that I bet some of you deal with too. I'd start a puzzle on my coffee table, but then dinner time rolls around and I'd have to either rush to finish it or carefully move all those pieces somewhere else. Super frustrating.

I tried using a regular lap desk at first since I already had one for my laptop. Honestly, it was better than nothing, but not by much. The pieces would slide around whenever I adjusted my position, and there was zero organization. Plus, most lap desks are way too small for anything bigger than a 500-piece puzzle.

That's when I discovered puzzle boards, and wow, what a difference.

A puzzle board is specifically designed for puzzles. It usually comes with a smooth working surface, raised edges to keep pieces from falling off, and separate sorting trays. Some even have covers so you can store your unfinished puzzle without worrying about pieces getting lost or your cat destroying your progress (speaking from experience here).

The main difference? A lap desk is just a flat portable surface. It works fine for writing, using a laptop, or eating. But for puzzles? It's like trying to cut vegetables with a butter knife. Sure, technically possible, but why make things harder?

I picked up a proper puzzle board a few months ago, and it completely changed my puzzle experience. I can work on my puzzle in the living room, then slide it under the couch when guests come over. The sorting trays keep my edge pieces separate from the interior ones, and everything stays exactly where I left it.

If you're serious about puzzles or even just do them occasionally, I'd definitely recommend checking out [a quality puzzle board](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board). They're not expensive, and the convenience is totally worth it.

The portability factor is huge too. With a puzzle board, I can work on my puzzle in bed, on the couch, or at the kitchen table without starting over each time. Try doing that with a lap desk without losing half your pieces.

Look, if you only do maybe one puzzle a year, a lap desk might work fine. But if you're doing puzzles regularly or tackling those bigger 1000+ piece monsters, do yourself a favor and [grab a dedicated puzzle board](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board). Your back and your sanity will thank you.

The investment is small, but the improvement in your puzzle-solving experience is massive. No more losing pieces, no more cramped workspace, and no more choosing between finishing your puzzle or eating dinner at an actual table.

Happy puzzling!",1,1763209938.0,newproductsamazon,0,1.0,False

1oxqioz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeUpAddictionUK/comments/1oxqioz/looking_for_an_afforadble_softsheer_matte/,Looking for an afforadble soft/sheer matte lipstick that is actually transfer-proof & long-lasting,"I recently purchased one of the Revolution Air Blur Soft Matte liquid lipsticks. It's perfect in every way, except for the fact that it transfers and doesn't even last an hour. 

I bought it because the reviews said it was long lasting. I've tried with multiple lip liners and no change. Also tried the trick involving blotting and using powder but this didn't work either 

Honestly I'm new to makeup and I don't understand why transfer proof isn't the default? I can't be reapplying lipstick every time I take a drink or just because it's faded after half an hour. I'd go through so much product! What's the point of lip makeup that goes everywhere? I've never gotten on with lip gloss for the same reason. I don't understand the point if it doesn't last (if someone wants to explain this to me I'd greatly appreciate it - otherwise why are people spending £30 on a lip gloss that lasts five minutes?) 

I'm often delivering talks and presentations at work so I need something that can withstand drinking water and coffee and throughout a full day of talks. I can apply more at lunch but that's the only chance I'll get all day to reapply 

I don't like normal liquid lipsticks because they're too matte and opaque. I love the slight sheerness of these revolution ones. I have low contrast colouring so lipstick usually looks like costume makeup on me, the sheer/soft style is the only kind that looks nice on me. I don't like glossy or shimmery finishes. 

I'm also cool toned so looking for a range of cool tones that aren't pink. I'm more of a red/brown. I can do neutral if it leans cool or is very neutral. 

I've tried the Maybelline Super Stay Vinyl and it was too intense for me and peeled off in the middle. Tried the Nyx soft matte lip creams and they don't last either but are closer in texture to what I want",3,1763209774.0,MakeUpAddictionUK,6,1.0,False
1oxqhlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1oxqhlj/i_got_tired_of_relying_on_vibes_for_safety_so_i/,"I got tired of relying on ""vibes"" for safety, so I built a platform to crowdsource real data.","Have you ever planned a trip or even just an evening out in a new area and fell down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out, ""Is this place *actually* safe?""

I have. Constantly. When I moved to a new city, I was paralyzed by safety anxiety. Every plan started with a dozen Google searches: ""is \[neighborhood\] safe at night,"" ""safe for solo women,"" etc. Friends gave conflicting advice, my parents were worried sick, and online forums were a mix of outdated posts and unhelpful ""I felt fine"" anecdotes.

Social media shows picture-perfect solo trips, but it never shows the reality of clutching your keys in your pocket or skipping an event because you're not sure how you'll get back alone.

I realized the information I needed didn't exist. Nobody tracks the data that *actually* matters: not which cafe has the best coffee, but whether you'll get harassed on the 10-minute walk there at 7 PM.

So, I decided to build the solution myself: **Safe or Not**.

It's a community platform where people can share and find real, street-level safety information. The goal is to build a trusted network, which is why I'm keeping the community curated, especially in these early stages. The moment a platform like this gets too big, it fills with noise and fake reviews.

I'm launching with a limited number of spots for foundational members who genuinely care about this problem. If you've ever felt that safety anxiety and want to be part of building a real solution, I'd love for you to join.

Those chemicals might be more addictive than the nicotine.

I woke up this morning, and of course, there was that urge, but it was like 1/4 of yesterday's. With coffee was always my favorite time to smoke a bunch of cigarettes and it was a killer a lot of the other times that I've quit, but it's not so bad today.

I'm starting to breathe better and my BP is down. Instead of wanting to sit here and smoke and smoke, I feel like working on a couple of projects and then hitting the gym today.

I'm not a religious man, but the only way that I might describe it this morning at least, is that perhaps I was somehow blessed this time. I couldn't tell you who did the blessing, maybe Odin?

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1owv6f3/babydoll_23/)

The dreams are back, with a vengeance. I chase my mother down an endless, darkened corridor. She never once looks back, even as I scream my throat hoarse calling for her. She disappears into doorways and feints around corners. Still, I pursue her, her hair floating behind her, just out of my grasp. She turns suddenly into a doorway I recognise. I don’t want to follow, but I do. In the silver gloom of the nursery, she stands over Ruthie’s crib, finally still, and I reach out to her for comfort. But when she faces me, she’s not Mum. She’s Anna. And from two black, eyeless holes, she weeps tears of blood. The rivulets cascade down her cheeks and drip off her chin, falling onto her chest. Her jumper is stained dark red at the nipples, the wetness spreading outwards.

Anna whispers something, barely audible. I ask her to repeat it, even as I realise what she’s said. This time, she screams it.

‘*What have you* done?’

I wake up, clammy and sweating. I can’t move, I just clutch the covers around me and try to calm down. My breath comes fast and shuddery, and I feel sick and scared and overheated.

Five days. Five days until Anna is back, and I can be gone from this house, and rid of Ruthie.

I spend the next hour typing, then deleting, multiple texts to Mum. Some are complete admissions of defeat; the ‘I told you so’ she so desperately craves. Some are bitter, ugly messages, blaming her for my dysfunction, my arrested development. Everything I’ve ever wanted to say, but have been too much of a coward. I’m still too much of a coward - those messages are deleted, too. Mostly, I draft excuses for why I want to come home. Looking after Ruthie has really made me appreciate our mother-daughter bond? She’ll see right through that. I need some time off? When I’ve only just started working. I can babysit for Tash? What, and deprive Mum of another little dolly to dress up? She’d never allow it, qualification or no qualification.

In the end, nothing gets sent. Mum must have been watching the typing notification bubble, because as soon as mine stops, hers pops up. I wait, but finally, hers stops too, and her green online status switches to grey. Our own little cold war. 

\-

It’s a good thing Ruthie isn’t a real baby. I can no longer take care of myself, let alone an infant. I spend the next couple of mornings psyching myself up to go downstairs and get ready for the day, before stumbling to the bathroom, then to the kitchen to cram a few handfuls of dry muesli into my mouth before going back to bed. By the third day, the muesli box has been moved to the side of the bed. I don’t go into the nursery. 

\-

Two nights before Anna returns, I dream of being a baby. I’m rocked in Mum’s arms while she sings to me; it’s a song I recognise from when I was little. She gazes down at me adoringly, but her expression turns sad. From there, her sadness turns to anguish, then to grief - her face contorting into a teary grimace. She plucks me away from the warmth of her chest, her arms outstretching as she plunges me into icy water. 

My eyes snap open. I’m back in my body. Worse for wear, but back, at least. I get out of bed, moving gingerly; my body aches from the lack of movement. It’s early; only just light out. Most people won’t even be on their way to work yet. I pick my jeans up from the floor and pull them on. I make my way down the stairs with painstaking effort, suddenly desperate for fresh air. In the time it takes to reach the front door, I miraculously remember to pick up the keys before I leave the house. Outside, I heave in huge lungfuls of fresh air, clearing out the stale from days cloistered in my depression nest. 

I find myself at the same cafe from my early adventure outside. I haven’t left the house since I was last here, and it’s obvious from my reflection in the cafe window. I use my nails to scrape my hair into an acceptable shape, and tuck my pyjama shirt into my jeans to make it look more intentional. I still look scruffy, but I can’t bring myself to care. Scruffy people are still allowed to buy coffee.

I trip over the lip of the threshold, stumbling slightly. From the barista’s expression, I can tell that she was watching my attempt to neaten up from inside. Hopefully, she doesn’t recognise me. 

It takes me three tries to order what I want. My tongue is clumsy in my mouth, and I jab my finger at the menu as I mumble out an order. The barista does her best to help, and eventually, she repeats something drinkable back to me. I nod, relieved to be at the end of this interaction. I don’t want to be in the house with the doll, but I feel so exposed out here, unable to hide my anxiety. 

‘...after?’

She’s saying something to me. 

‘What?’ I ask, blearily. *Pardon*, my mother’s voice corrects in my head.

‘How’s the baby you’ve been looking after?’ she repeats, clearly trying to keep her sidelong glances at me discreet as she heats the milk. 

‘Oh, the baby. Right.’

I should say something. Some bullshit about how often she’s been smiling, or holding her head up by herself. Something light, positive and casual.

‘She isn’t real.’ is what I end up blurting out. 

The barista stares at me, only pulled out of it when the milk starts to bubble over. 

‘What do you mean?’ she asks, an attempt at keeping her tone light as she wipes down the nozzle. 

‘The baby. She’s a doll. She isn’t real.’ I hadn’t expected to tell anyone. Not for a while. I thought this would be a funny story that I’d practice in the mirror two years from now before using it as an ice breaker at parties. *Did I ever tell you guys about the time I babysat a haunted doll*?

‘A doll?’ the barista parrots. 

‘Yeah. It’s a thing. People do it because they can’t have real babies. So I’m being paid to nanny a fake baby.’ I laugh then, too loudly and too brightly. A woman tucked behind a laptop in the corner glances over in annoyance.

‘Wow, that’s-’

‘How much do I owe you?’ I cut her off. I don’t know why I invited the conversation, but I’m eager to end it as soon as possible.

‘Oh. £4.50, please.’

I pull out a fiver and push it across the counter to her. ‘Keep the change.’

‘We can’t do that.’

‘As a tip.’

She squirms at my insistence. ‘That’s very generous, but we still need you to-’

‘Give me the change, then.’ 

She hands me a 50p coin, which I promptly deposit in the jar on the counter marked ‘TIPS :)’ 

I don’t give her time to thank me as I swipe the coffee off the counter and book it for the door. I don’t thank her, either. 

\-

I finally get a message back from Anna. *Sorry for the radio silence! It’s amazing here, and I’ve been so busy! I knew you’d keep it all under control. I’ll be back tomorrow :) Anna*

3 minutes later, there’s a follow-up.

*P.S: Hope Ruthie has been behaving. Give her a big kiss from me* *xxx*

Maybe all she needed was a break. Her ‘daughter’ is already an afterthought, and she’s not been gone two weeks. Will she realise that she’s been playing pretend when she comes back and is confronted with a plastic doll? 

As an experiment, I fire off the last of my backlog of Ruthie photos. On her back, her arms posed stiffly above her, as if reaching for something. Maybe it will be the final straw, the thing that finally snaps her out of her delusion. 

But, like the others, the photo just gets a heart react. 

\-

I’m so exhausted after two weeks of nightmares that it feels less tiring to just stay up. I watch episode after episode of Family Guy, the big band theme tune snapping me back to alertness every 20 minutes. I must sleep for a little bit, because I lay back to rest my eyes for a moment, then open them to a completely different episode. No dreams, though. As the sun starts to rise, I drag myself off the couch, and get to work on setting the house right. 

\-

Despite the lack of sleep, the cleaning job is surprisingly effective, especially as the time ticks closer to Anna’s arrival. I finish packing and cleaning up the evidence of the cleaning itself about 5 minutes after she’s due home. Thank God she’s not a prompt person. She’ll just have to deal with my slightly unkempt appearance.

\-

She’s really not a prompt person; it’s been nearly two hours. I didn’t go for a shower, in case she came home halfway through, but I washed in the sink, put on clean clothes, and even had time to put makeup on. With a little squirt of Anna’s *Coco Mademoiselle*, I’m downright presentable. But where the hell is she? I’m starting to get paranoid that she’s never coming back. I can feel Ruthie’s presence from upstairs; weighing on me oppressively. I just want to be out of here. Going home will be no picnic, not with the current state of mine and Mum’s relationship, but at least I’ll be back in my own room. At least no more nightmares. And best of all, *no more Ruthie*.

I’m actually pacing the house by the time I hear the taxi pull up. Striding back and forth like a parent waiting for an unruly child. So this is how Mum felt. I pause when I hear the engine turn off, and my chest leaps when I finally hear the sweet sound of the key turning in the front door lock. I have the last minute idea to throw myself onto the sofa, so I look like I’ve been waiting patiently, and not like I’ve been doing circuits of her living room to keep myself from picking up my phone to scream at her to get the fuck home already. 

The door opens, and the awful silence is broken by the bustle and fuss of Anna and her suitcases.

‘I’m so sorry I’m late! We were delayed taking off, and then my 5G was playing up when we touched down, absolute nightmare!’ 

‘No problem at all.’ I reply, covering any annoyance I may feel with a huge, toothy smile. ‘Let me help you with those.’ I hurry to grab the suitcase she’s dragging behind her, and am dismayed to see *another* suitcase on the threshold. Who needs two suitcases and a cabin bag for a 13-day trip? I took less than that when I left home to live in a psych ward for 6 months. 

I shuffle both cases in, deciding that they can stay with Anna’s cabin luggage in the hallway. No way I’m lugging them up the stairs. I hold my breath, and follow Anna into the main house.

Anna takes in the room around her, approvingly.

‘It’s so clean in here! You really did a wonderful job.’

I heave a little sigh of relief that she hadn’t taken it as a comment on her cleanliness. The house is pretty chilly from the windows being open all morning, but it seems to have been worth it; even I have to admit that after 7 solid hours of cleaning and tidying, the place looks like a showroom. ‘I hope you don’t mind, I know how overwhelmed you were.’ 

Anna puffs out her cheeks and nods at me. *Tell me about it!* 

‘A little holiday has done me a world of good! And how was Ruthie, did she give you any trouble?’ 

‘None at all.’ I lie. ‘She was good as gold.’ 

‘Is she sleeping?’ Anna asks, glancing above our heads.

‘She went down about an hour ago.’ I worked out a backstory while I was cleaning the kitchen sink. ‘I’m sure she’ll be thrilled to see you, though!’

‘I really can’t thank you enough.’ Anna reaches into her handbag and pulls out a leather wallet. It looks designer, but it’s not like I can tell the real thing from a knockoff. She takes a moment to count out the amount, then hands me a bundle of bills. ‘What we agreed on, plus a little extra, to make up for my lateness! Honestly, you’ve been an absolute star!’ 

I try not to think about Ruthie’s vacant, plastic stare; those grasping, molded fingers.

‘Order a taxi home; I’ll pay for it. But right now, I need to go and see my baby.’ Anna grins at me, then heads for the staircase. 

I pull out my phone and open the Uber app. I wonder what will happen to Anna from here. Has her time away really cured her, or will she slip right back into whatever psychosis makes her believe she has a living baby daughter?

It’s not my problem anymore. I calculate the cost of the Uber. £15.90. Call it £16.

From upstairs, a scream echoes through the house.

\-

In the weeks that follow, people have all kinds of opinions on what happened. I’m called the next Lucy Letby, Myra Hindley; Ruthie is likened to James Bulger and Baby P. They interview people on the street and ask them what punishment I deserve. 

‘Everything she did to that poor child, and more!’ one woman tells a reporter, who nods in sage agreement. 

There are calls to bring back the death penalty, especially for me. I get letters; long descriptions of the torture random people want to inflict on me. I take it all in, numbly. 

When the police arrived, I expected them to walk into the nursery, realise the situation and break the news to Anna. She wasn’t real, she was never real. I expected them to tell me I did the right thing, or to ask if Anna seemed stable otherwise. 

They didn’t. 

They emerged from the nursery looking pale, the female officer holding her chest. She read me my rights with a shaky voice, while her partner called in a bus over the radio. *Make sure the coroner is suited up,* he said. *It’s a mess in there*. 

I was put into handcuffs and bundled into a police car. During the ride to the station, the female officer spoke to her partner in hushed tones about her own children. *I just can’t imagine anyone doing that to a baby.*

I don’t remember a whole lot about being processed, the interview. I tried to tell them that whatever they thought they saw in there, it wasn’t a real baby. But the interviewing officer was talking to me in that horrible, patronising tone they used to use on me in the residential home, and I just clammed up. I should have asked for a lawyer, probably, like they always do on TV. I didn’t. I think I was still trying to wrap my head around what they were telling me. 

Mum came to see me the next day, after my bail was set. She looked ridiculous in her sunglasses and trench coat, like she was undercover. It was all for nothing, anyway; when my identity was revealed to the public a week later, and my face plastered all over the papers, there wasn’t a disguise in the world that would deter the press. 

She didn’t say much during that visit. She was mostly there to tell me that she wouldn’t be paying my bail.

‘You know I love you no matter what, but I just can’t stand by you on this one.’ 

I knew the real reason; she couldn’t afford it. I didn’t press it. They’d showed me the crime scene photos towards the end of my interview. In the same pretty dress I’d put on Doll Ruthie, was the bloated, blue corpse of a human infant; waterlogged, oozing and mottled with bruises. I don’t know how. But I know I probably should never be allowed out of prison. 

 

\-

At the trial, I watch the friendly barista sob into her hands.

‘I should have realised something was wrong. I should have done something.’ She was kind to me. And in return, I pulled her into this horror show, traumatising her for life. 

They show CCTV footage from that same day. Even when they play the few seconds of clear movement from inside the pram over and over, I can’t believe it. I saw what I saw. But, the evidence keeps coming. Not that Ruthie was a real baby; that’s proved pretty easily. Anna may have been isolated in her big suburban house, but there’s still birth records, check-ups. They can even prove that she died in my ‘care’, from the date of death reported by the autopsy. The real damning evidence is that I’m insane. And there’s plenty of evidence of that. 

My own lawyer, Richard, brings in ex-workers from the unit. Most of them have moved on from care work, or even retired, but they’re all here to corroborate that I was, in fact, mental. 

I keep my eyes fixed on the table in front of me. Richard says it’s good optics - I look, at best, penitent, and at worst, confused. But mostly I can’t bear to see how people look at me. I’m not just crazy; I’m *evil*. A career baby-killer, now that I have two under my belt. I don’t think Tash has attended a single day of trial, and I can’t say I blame her. For all she knows, her baby could have been next. Hell, for all *I* know. 

\-

Mum’s dressed all in black like she’s come for my funeral, not my trial. I expected that she wouldn’t exactly be helpful as a character witness, but my lawyer explains later that she was perfect. Not only did she make her own case for my insanity, but he suggests that her demeanour on the stand may have convinced much of the court that mental illness runs in the family. I snort at that, the closest thing I’ve felt to laughter in a long time. It turns out that insisting you knew something was wrong with your daughter the entire time while testifying in the death of an infant, doesn’t ingratiate you to a jury. Richard quietly passes on something he overheard from a juror during recess:

*No wonder, with a mother like that.*

\-

I drift through the rest of the trial, only occasionally paying attention. There’s only so much you can hear about your own mental deficiency until it’s like, okay, we get it.

The jury get it, as well. Despite Anna’s lawyer fighting hard to paint me as some baby-hating, Machiavellian mastermind, it’s apparently clear to just about everyone that I’m simply not well. The psych assessments are barely necessary. Richard is thrilled when the jury come back with a unanimous verdict of Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity, but I can’t quite bring myself to share his enthusiasm about an indefinite psych hold. Maybe it seems like the better option to people who have never spent time on a ward. I almost wish they *would* bring back the death penalty for me. 

\-

Dr Kim is a kind-looking woman, with a soft-spoken voice. She doesn’t look at me like the others; like I’m a monster, like they’re contemplating stabbing me with the closest sharp object. Her office is properly decorated with calming artwork and gentle pastels - a nice change from the stark-white brutalism of the ward. I’m even allowed to sit in here without one of the ward nurses for security, as long as Dr Kim keeps the blinds on her office door open.

‘Good morning, Abby.’ she says, and I stretch my mouth into a polite smile. It’s nice to hear my nickname again, not ‘Abigail’ or ‘Miss Fletcher’ spat out by the other nurses and residents, or clinically spoken in full on the news reports when they ‘forget’ to turn them off at TV time. 

‘How are you feeling?’ she asks, which is nice to hear, too. 

‘Tired.’ I say. ‘They put me on sedatives most of the day, but they won’t let me sleep. When I do sleep, it’s just nightmares.’

Dr Kim’s face twists sympathetically, and she scribbles a few notes on a pad beside her, impressively managing to do it without more than a glance at the paper. ‘That must be hard. How do you feel about everything that’s happened?’

‘Confused, mostly. I thought I knew what I saw, but none of the photos line up with my memory. It all feels like some elaborate prank.’

Dr Kim nods thoughtfully. ‘That does sound confusing.’ 

Then, after a pause, ‘I wonder if I could introduce you to somebody.’

I wait while she gets up, reaching into a canvas bag that was waiting for me on her desk, and pulls out a bundle wrapped in a soft, white blanket. Shifting it into the crook of her elbow, she leans forward to offer it to me. I take the bundle, and loosen the wrapping with trembling hands. I gasp.

It’s a baby. A living, breathing baby, with a scrunchy face and tiny fingernails. I stroke the baby’s little cheek, and it’s so soft.

‘You look like you recognise baby. Can you tell me who it is?’

I can feel tears welling up in my eyes as a smile splits my face, the first genuine smile in a long time.

Their newest tactic? Snacks.

They sent a company-wide email bragging about the “revitalized breakroom experience.”

A bowl of bruised bananas

Off-brand granola bars

Coffee that tastes like printer ink

Then in the next paragraph, they said these “amenities” are why we should return to the office more often.

I’ve been on HRT since 12/09/23.

I am deeply longing for emotional connection & love, not sex. An EQUAL partnership. Something uncomplicated for once that makes me really feel content & safe, and feel like I’ve got a competent trusted person next to me who won’t break my heart for the millionth time. A life with a beautiful young woman by my side who won’t hurt me physically, emotionally, or financially like past partners.

Big into Video Games, RPGs, movies, WWII, reading, photography, shooting, bike riding, urban exploration.

I’m pretty shy, a little chubby but trying to work out more. I do suffer from Psoriasis but it’s mostly under control with medication. I hate smoking of tobacco, and usually only drink socially. 420 friendly as long as it isn’t a total obsession like my ex who stole hundreds from me to buy it.

I love helping others. I admit, I need help with my social skills because of my upbringing, but I'm learning fast.

I’m only attracted to feminine appearing people. Not looking for anyone over 32 or under 21 unless showing a good level of maturity.

Not looking for long distance, I deeply crave non-sexual physical intimacy & fun activities together.

I am a switch. I am NOT Poly, only monogamous.

1oxq8ef,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxq8ef,Making my buildings neater,"Hi all.

I don't actually own a rail set up, but a friend of mine is a little skint so I'm working on some 00/1.76 scale buildings for his set up.  I'm a scale aircraft and miniature figure builder and painter, and not a very good one tbh, but I'd like to make him something that he will be able to use. I've put together a couple from thick card and used brickwork paper for the walls. Made recesses in the wall so there's some depth, and matchsticks, and bits of coffee stirrers for the trim - but, it still looks tatty. 

Where the corners meet, the paper just kind of ends, and looks like paper stuck to the card. I put a green trim around those areas, but I still don't like it.  I'm sure beggers can't be choosers, but if I do something, especially for a friend, it needs to be done right. 

Any suggestions on how to make the brickwork corners meet up neatly would be greatly appreciated. I can't be putting a trim all the way around. ",4,1763208885.0,ModelTrainScenery,0,1.0,False

1oxq74d,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1oxq74d/networking_omg/,Networking omg,"So after 5 full months of unemployment I finally got a job (yay!), and the journey has not been easy. 

Ive been thinking of a career transition into project related jobs in a corporate environment. In my previous jobs I didn’t have that much exposure to large scale projects or programme, but I am confident in my capabilities and adaptabilities, and I’ve got relevant certificates. 
I thought as long as I highlighted my strengths and experience and tailored every single application I’d get a job easily. Omg I was so wrong. 

I’d spend at least 1 full day writing one cover letter, some even took me 3-4 days. Mixing the wording from the ad with my own voice to keep the genuineness, having friends check my applications, and upskilling through online courses etc. I’d also write follow up emails saying things like “hey I put a lot of thoughts and coffee into this application”, BUT most of the time all I got was a generic rejection email. My applications just seemed never landed on the manager’s desk. 

After 22 rejections I thought, fck this aint going anywhere, so for the first time I asked my friend who works at the organisation I’d applied a job to whether they happened to know the manager’s email address so I could send the follow up directly to the manager instead of the recruitment team. 
My friend went “oh we are on the same floor, let me go and have a chat with them!” And BOOM 30 mins later I was talking to the manager, and 4 days later I got an offer. 

Faaa no wonder some people on LinkedIn keep saying networking is everything eh. Kinda ironic but tailoring cover letters just seems less important even tho recruiters always stress about it. I’m ofc thrilled to be getting back in the workforce but faaa a 2-min chat through a connection did MORE for me than all that time and effort of perfecting my applications lol. Faaa.
