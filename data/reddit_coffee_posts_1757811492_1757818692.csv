Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the Serie A spectacle that had statisticians clutching their calculators like a toddler clutches a half-eaten gelato—Napoli’s 3-1 trouncing of Fiorentina. If this match had a soundtrack, it’d be a one-man band: *drumroll* for Napoli’s dominance, *cymbal crash* for Fiorentina’s despair. Let’s dissect this like a particularly enthusiastic chef filleting a fish.

**Parsing the Odds: Why Your Bookie Probably Cried**  
Pre-match, the odds suggested Fiorentina had a 1.61 coefficient for a home win and a 0-0 draw. Translating from Bookmakerese: “Hey, maybe the home team pulls off a miracle… or we’ll just take your money and cry in a corner.” Implied probability? Around 62% for Fiorentina to win. A number so bold it makes a tightrope walker over Niagara Falls feel safe. But Napoli, the defending champions with a 9-point lead after three games, were the statistical equivalent of a loaded cannon pointed at Fiorentina’s defense.

**Digesting the News: Paladino’s Pizza and Conte’s Coffee**  
Fiorentina, fresh off a coaching change that brought Paladino from Monza like a pizza delivery man racing against time, had the consistency of a Neapolitan accent—*meh*. They drew with Cagliari and Torino, proving they’re as likely to lose to a vending machine as a soccer team. Their lone goal from Luka Ranjieri? A valiant effort, like trying to win a race on a tricycle while everyone else has a Tesla.

Napoli, meanwhile, are living the dream under Conte, who’s turned their season into a rollercoaster with only upside. Kevin De Bruyne (yes, *that* De Bruyne—apparently Napoli’s transfer team watches the same flea-market deals as everyone else) opened the scoring with a penalty so clinical, it made a Swiss watchmaker weep into his espresso. Then there’s Rasmus Højlund, the new kid from Manchester United, who scored on his debut like he’d been there all season. If debuts were job interviews, Højlund would’ve gotten a 10-year contract and a company car.

**Humorous Spin: Soccer as a Metaphor for Life**  
Fiorentina’s defense? A sieve that would make a sieve blush. Naples’ attack, meanwhile, is so potent, they could score against a brick wall if the wall stood still. De Bruyne’s penalty? The definition of “easy button.” Højlund’s goal? As smooth as a *cappuccino* in a Florentine café—except Napoli’s coffee is better.

And let’s not forget Fiorentina’s “strategy” of drawing games, which is soccer’s version of a screensaver: visually present, but accomplish nothing. Their coach Paladino? He’s building a legacy as fast as a snail in a sauna.

**Prediction: The Verdict from the Crystal (And Very Confident) Ball**  
So, who wins? Well, the math says Fiorentina had a 62% chance. The reality? Napoli won 3-1, making the odds about as reliable as a fashion sense from 2015. The lesson here? Never trust a bookie who thinks a 0-0 draw is Fiorentina’s best move. Napoli, with their title-winning swagger and attack line that could power a small country, are the kings of Serie A—unless they’re challenged by a team with a functional defense.

In conclusion, bet on the champions. Unless you enjoy watching Fiorentina try to win, in which case, maybe bet on *how* they’ll lose. Spoiler: It’ll be dramatic, confusing, and involve at least one player tripping over their own ambition. *Again.*

*Final Score: Napoli 3, Fiorentina 1. Implied Probability of Fiorentina Winning: 62%. Actual Probability of Fiorentina Winning: 0%. Math is hard. Soccer is harder.*

1ngg3bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bidets/comments/1ngg3bw/the_bidet_has_simultaneously_improved_yet/,The bidet has simultaneously improved yet destroyed my life,"Before you start hating, keep reading. This is a bidet-positive post. 

My husband bought a bidet in 2019. Yes, we did it before it was cool. The 2020 toilet paper shortage was not an issue for us, and we were laughing all the way to the crapper. 

We have separate bathrooms because we are those people, and when he started seeing the praises of the bidet, I decided to try one out myself. I used his and immediately knew that purchasing my own was no longer a want but a need. 

Admittedly, I’m more of an American than I thought because I was a little hesitant at first. To be fair, the thought of a mini fire hose going up and/ or near your butt is a little alarming if you’ve never experienced it. 

Once you start, you cannot stop. There is no going back. 

There lies the problem. The bidet has completely spoiled me. I know I am not alone in this. Pooping has essentially become the main focus of my day. I seriously won’t leave the house until I’ve pooped. Sometimes, this doesn’t always work in my favor. 

I will not shit in public. Realistically, I know that when you have to shit, you have to shit. Have I since participated in this plebeian act since I was so forth blessed by the bidet? Of course. As someone who regularly consumes Fiber One bars and coffee (not necessarily at the same time), this is inevitable. 

I hate the thought of going without it. Yes, I have a travel bidet. It’s better than nothing. 

When I’ve been in the office working, pooping on the job was the equivalent of a Clive Barker-induced nightmare. While the Reddit famous adage of “boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that’s why I poop on company time”  is accurate, it’s not something that the bidet kids want to face. 

Luckily, I work at home, so this isn’t an issue for me. However, I feel for everyone else who doesn’t and has to use toilet paper like a peasant.

I sing the praises of the bidet as much as I can, but not without this warning. 

There is part of me that wishes I had never experienced it so I wouldn’t know what I was missing. Now that I do know what I’m missing, I am poop-doomed.

I'm looking for a hint from the community. I would like to develop my coffee roasting skills to the next level and start selling coffee. The issue is I'm living in apartments, and they don't allow any venue. So I can't apply for a cottage food license.

I know that the area I'm living in has a certified kitchen. I think that leasing time at this kitchen could be a possible solution to roast coffee for sale, but I can't find any information on what type of license I should apply for to have the right to sell coffee at the local farmers market, for example.

I'll be glad if someone can point me in the right direction for future investigation.

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

I have been looking for a book since my teenage years.  It was one of those teen romance from the 80s/90s.

The story was about a girl named Lori (maybe Laurie) who was dating a popular boy named Bob.  She gave up her entire life to watch him at football practice and support him at his games and help him with his homework.  He was rich, she was poor.  A new girl comes to town and Bob stops hanging out with Laurie.  It culminates in Laurie throwing herself a birthday party.  Her mom made her a homemade burgundy or mulberry colored pantsuit to wear.  She had a friend come help her decorate for the party and they talked about having dim lighting because her house was pretty rundown.  Bob wasn't there at the beginning of the party, and ends up coming in late with the new girl who is now his girlfriend.  He didn't say a word to Lori/Laurie about the change.  

She wakes up the next morning and sees a huge mess, someone left a piece of half eaten cake on the coffee table.  She decides these people were never her friends and she wants to start doing stuff for herself.  She tries out for the school choir, and while she isn't the best singer her teacher praises her for having perfect pitch, which they tell her is very rare.  She also joins another club, either biking or running.  I think it's a biking club because I seem to remember her dad helping her get his bicycle back in working order.  There she meets a guy named Greg and he doesn't seem to like her at first.  There are some situations I don't remember but I do believe they get together in the end.  
 
This is all I remember.  I can't remember the name of the book.  The cover had a girl with dark brown hair I want to say, and maybe a blue background, but I think the artwork on those teen romances were interchangeable.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about?  I would love to read this book again!  I have thought of it often in the last 30+ years.

I don't know how to describe my situation so I figure I'll start from the beginning. Some would say I had it all. I married my high school sweet heart right after graduation, he worked to let me explore what ever my heart desired, and, hell, the sex was amazing. Then things began to dry up. He no longer had the sex drive, seemed less interested, lost his smile when he was around me. I tried to make things right, I did everything I could but it wasn't enough. I knew a divorce was coming. Two decades of my life with someone I wanted to love was now behind me. I survived, I rebranded myself. Spent my portion on a new body, tummy tuck, lipo, bbl, fresh tatas and a gym membership to keep everything in its place. I made enough to get by but I have off the hungry cougar which had my fair share of one offs and failed relationships but everything failed.

 That is, until, I received a random dm on my social media platform of choice. At first, I thought it was a scam at all had that stink of it but the next day, a follow up message came in. The account was from one of the many different ""bop"" accounts or ""Oh F"" girls that had side projects. Her text had prefect punctuation and came from their main. If it was a scam, it was the most technological and had the most effort put into it. So I replied, taking the bait, with a curt hello and how are you. They took some time after reading my message before responding with excitement. Thus began our conversation and it was somewhat anxiety inducing to have someone latch on to me. Then came the kicker, ""I want to meet up. I'll be at XYZ club in their vip space. You should come and hangout with Me and my friends,"" was the message I received. Then a picture of you with your friends and significant others. All of them were around your age and scantily clad. It made my heart flutter like I remembered from back in high school. 

 I knew the club, I hadn't been to it but I knew the price of the vip rooms. It was incredibly expensive and being right on the beach, the security also made it one of the safest in the city. She then said to come in swimwear and just come right to the vip area through the side entrance which I hadn't known about. Apparently you had to be invited to even know about it. The party wasn't going to happen for a week or so and she had no hard feelings when I said I'd think about it. She said my name would be on the list if I decided to come or not. 

 The week leading up to the party was the most stressful thing I had gone through since my divorce. The idea of someone's daughter hitting on me like a horny teen made me feel things I haven't felt in forever. Worst yet, it all seemed genuine. The anxiety never left as I searched through my bikinis and realized that I'd be just as scantily clad as the girls there. My face flushed as I got dressed and through fishnet designer robe over top with a small hand bag with the essentials before having an Uber ferry me to the club. 

 It was only 7pm and the club had a line stretching around the block but the driver seemed to know which side to park on. What looked like an employee entrance, had two men in suits standing, one with a clipboard in hand. When I approached they politely asked for my ID and after looking it over and seemingly mark off a name on the paper, they knocked on the door which opened near immediately. Another man was on the other side who offered his arm to escort Me out to a shuttle bus which drove out to a covered pavilion. The deck was screened in and every entrance had a guard. Music blasted, voices laughed, and talked as I approached. 

You burst out of the pavilion and sprinted into my arms.  You were more gorgeous in person and I nearly toppled over when you left and wrapped your arms and thick legs around me. I had to carry you inside which began an entire night of partying and living it up. I had partied before and I've kissed girls but it all paled in comparison to this. I had experimented but I had never been with a woman let alone someone half my age. That night, I had twerked on, been humped by, got motorboated, sucked shots off of, and French kissed every girl in the party. The guys who were seemingly the boyfriends of the girls didn't interact. They seemingly stayed in their place as if they would be beaten if they engaged. I only regained consciousness when the sun was high in the sky and with a massive hang over. I was back home and my bikini was still on with the knots I tied. My phone had a single message from you. It was a question asking if I wanted to privately meet since we had such a good time. 

 I agreed and it was there in the coffee shop in a tucked away corner when you popped the question. I was going to be your sugar baby and I'd be by your side wherever you went. When I asked about your supposed boyfriend, you scoffed and said he was just a tool to keep the thirsty guys paying for your pics or vids online. She preferred girls but there was something about older women that drove you wild. You even suggested a trial run. Spend a week with you and if I liked it, we would become a thing. If not, you'd disappear and I'd never hear or be bothered by you again. 


 So here I am, standing infront of a massive house in a gated community with a week's worth of clothes knowing exactly why I was here. My phone had buzzed and the sum of money you had stated you pay for me had been cleared and was now sitting in my account. I gulped as the door knob turned.

I did a ton of research online before scheduling my first IPL photofacial with a highly rated NYC dermatologist who did a great job at electrocautery with my moles.  I said going in I wanted to treat sunspots, freckles, signs of aging but asked if they could go a little conservative so I didn't get burned or bruised like I saw some redditors experienced. They said it was $650 for the full face, and said ""multiple treatments recommended"" but I wanted to see how 1 would go.

I get in and talk about sunspots and the derm goes ""oh just the cheeks then!"" and I'm like... no, I want the whole face. That's what I'm paying for.  And I asked to not be burned but also I wanted to see visible results.

It didn't really hurt, the 2nd pass was a little spicier than the first pass, and I had redness but no swelling or darkening of any of the spots on my face.

It's the next day, and there's like a smattering of tiny tiny coffee ground like darkness - BARELY ANY, which not what I was expecting for $650.  Did the derm go too light in an effort to make more money?  I'm kind of pissed, I took off work for a week for recovery.  Or will more dark coffee grinds develop over the next few days? I feel like he also completely missed my mouth and chin.

TLDR: Did my derm screw me over, or does this take time to see 'coffee grinds' results?  photos taken before and next day, they look basically identical

1ngfpoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1ngfpoo/how_to_cope_recover_after_a_binge/,How to cope & recover after a binge?,"TL;DR:

What strategies or methods do you use to mentally cope after a binge and keep it together without falling into the pit of self-loathing and regret? Are there any good bits of data that are relieving to know about regarding how the human body reacts after an episode, like if it’s all water weight and how long it takes until we’re back to normal weight? And is there anything you do to detox your body after consuming so much food and sugar/salt/fat?

Long version:

26M here. I’ve bounced between EDs, starting with BED, which turned into AN, and currently a form of BN. I’m the lowest weight ever w/o being underweight and I finally like my appearance. Before, I could restrict and resist urges to binge and even incorporate my cravings into the calorie budget. Now, I’m in binge/restrict cycles that are incredibly mentally/physically taxing. I “purge” after binges by not eating for days and overexercising. I recognize the self-fulfilling prophecy of all this, too.

I’ve found triggers and try to avoid them, plus binges have gotten a bit better (less calories, more controlled, throwing out foods that weren’t tasty), but I have work ahead of me. My PCP and therapist have pointed out my ED, but neither have been helpful or understanding. I’m looking for a dual-Dietician/Therapist specialized in EDs now because I’m not well, despite the “progress” I’ve made in going from morbidly obese to a healthy BMI in just 1 year.

My biggest struggle isn’t even the binge itself, which is bad and needs to be avoided; it’s what comes after that concerns me most.

Feelings of extreme guilt, regret, self-loathing, drug abuse, restricting until the calories are “paid back.” Rarely, I might get thoughts that I shouldn’t be here anymore. I can get really low, worried that I’ve destroyed the image I worked hard to achieve. I’m sure these are familiar to most of us here.

I’m trying to get better at coping when a binge happens and be gentler on myself and those around me (who I often take my negative feelings out on).

Yesterday, I went to the State Fair. I haven’t been in years, because until now, I was so self-conscious of my looks that I didn’t want to be in public. I recognized ahead of time that I’d probably eat some calorie-dense things, and I did. I enjoyed them, and right now, I don’t feel regret for having ate them. It was a special occasion, you know?

I read a quote in an article about BED that most people “binge” or overeat in some way every once in a while, like on holidays or at events, and how it isn’t disordered until it is a recurring issue. That helped ease my mind a little.

After the fair, I engaged in a trigger (smoking weed—munchies anyone?) and bought snacks at the gas station to eat that I knew was excessive after the fair food. Then went to a late-night restaurant and shared 3 different dishes with my friend and GF. Then went home and helped myself to an assortment of snacks like sour candy, dubai chocolate, flavored Cheez Its, snack cakes, Oreos, etc. I threw out snacks that I thought were mid instead of forcing myself to eat them, which was progress. All-in-all, I went over my maintenance by ~4.7k calories, with a total of ~7.1k calories for the whole day.

I told myself that I’d just go back to eating normal today, staying within my deficit, and getting some nutrition instead of restricting. But here I am, restricting. And plan to continue tomorrow, or longer, until that calorie “debt” is paid. I know it’s wrong, but I’m struggling to avoid it. It eases my mind to repent for those sins and get rid of the excess weight faster than slower. I have an image to maintain, am I right? Ugh.

How do you guys cope the day after a severe binge? I’m curious of both the mental and physical side of things. Are there strategies you implement to calm those thoughts of self-loathing or avoid falling into restriction? Are there any supplements you take or methods to detox (other than hydration) and de-bloat? Are there any helpful tidbits of knowledge regarding the weight we put on afterwards, and how to get rid of it safely and efficiently? Do you exercise, drink black coffee, go back to eating normal, eat specific things, etc.? I just really need some advice from people who know the struggle.

Two eight-foot tables had been rolled into my open garage at 6:15 a.m. while I was showering. My car was parked inside. Boxes were stacked along the wall. Our permit lists setup as 8 to noon. Last year the committee staged at the organizer’s driveway. I asked them to use that plan again. They said the curb would look cleaner without stacks and kept moving deeper into my space. I slid the tables back out, closed the garage, and sent a message to the group that my property was not a staging area. I lined the tables by the cones on the curb so they were ready at street level.

The schedule slipped and the story became that I blew up the timeline. My phone filled with complaints while I made coffee. I like the party and usually help, so the pile-on stung. I pointed to the permit hours and quiet hours, and added that my insurance does not cover other people’s equipment inside my garage. The organizer cooled off later, few committee members stayed irritated though. 



I tried to keep the event moving anyway. I ran an extension cord across my front lawn, bought ice, and helped set chairs in the street once the clock hit eight. My garage stayed closed. I just don't wanna let a crowd treat my garage as free storage before sunrise is a bad precedent.

On the palate blackberry and figs up front, plums, leather, herbal notes, rich and ripe still with a smooth mouth feel. Probably not much time left. Cork was barely saturated. 

1996 Similar nose to the 99, slight barnyard that blew off into more straw. Over ripe strawberries and blackberries, stewed plums. Cork didn't make it out in one piece 

1973 decent ulage but signs of seepage but no mold growth. Just a few scrappings to clean it off. Fully saturated cork came out whole with a poor man's durand. Lots of barnyard on the nose but hints of clay and forest floor, coffee and black fruit. Tastes of black fruit compote, straw, coffee and coco, creme de cassis notes. Definitely past it's prime but you could get hints of what it used to be. As it opened that rusty nail/soy character and barnyard didn't blow off. Drank a few glasses and let it sit for awhile. Hours later it didn't improve but glad I got to taste one of my older syrahs. Second photo. 

All in all, stags leap from this era isn't the stags' leap of today, they have lost their vibe. Treasurey is sadly created a mass produced mid range wine vs something that felt more exclusive. More wine but less soul. Including their events compared to other wineries just feel too corporate. Recently, had tickets to one event that ended up being cancelled extremely last minute when I reached out as to why it took weeks to get a response and they said they haven't cancelled an event since 2023. Sadly, I see some of the same things happening at Etude and Frank family. Standards have slipped into massly over produced fruit bombs that need 5 hours to open or 10 years time in my opinion.

I own a small coffee shop and recently got contacted by a company called Quick Access Capital. They offered me a “working capital advance” that seems faster and less complicated than going through a traditional bank.

I haven’t used this type of funding before, so I’m trying to understand if it’s a smart option or if there are things I should watch out for. The rep mentioned quick approval and flexible repayment, but I know there can sometimes be fine print with alternative lenders.

Has anyone here worked with them (or similar companies)?

•	Anything in the process that surprised you (good or bad)?
•	Would you recommend them, or should I stick to more traditional financing?

Doing it good it's just on another level.

After days, months, years (and centuries for the elves programmer out there) of writing code you probably stop complimenting yourself for spaghettoing your way up to kinda-working solutions and start searching ways to improve the quality of what you're doing and how you're doing it.

It’s hard because he was SO kind, always present and definitely loved and cared for me. But, it was like he wasn’t capable of physically taking care of me ever. Not that I needed it often, but the usual amount. The when your sick amount.  For context:

I got food poisoning while he was over, and he spent the night. He did not get out of bed once to help me, not even to get water. No staying up to talk, hold my hair, make sure I’m okay. He went to work in the morning, and my friends offered to bring me food. I cried about him and told him I was upset he didn’t help, and he brought some soup on his lunch break. That was kind, but it took my asking explicitly for it. 

This summer, I had a cystectomy, and was out for the count for a bit. He was awesome and came to the surgery and he spent the second night with me after, my mom came in town the weekend of to make sure I was okay. The night he slept over, I could not get him to wake up. Talking loud, shoving, shaking. I think he was awake, he talked and turned over, he just felt like sleeping. I wasn’t supposed to engage my core at all, but I had to because he wouldn’t help. 

More context: boyfriend and I share(d) a cat. After my surgery, there was no help with feeding the cat, scooping litter, cleaning, laundry, carrying groceries, nothing. He kept asking me to carry things that I wasn’t allowed to per doctor orders. I kept reminding him, but he made me feel like a burden, so I stopped. 

I tried to break up with him then, but he said I wasn’t giving him the chance to fix anything. 

I would help him. He crashed at my place between renting apartments, I’d grocery shopped for him, picked up food, ran errands, offered to buy medicine or bring him food when he’s sick, brought him food or things he’d forgotten at work. 

I got sick right before our final breakup, and I asked if he would come hang out and help me out. We had talked about how I needed to ask explicitly when I wanted help or anything from him, so I did. He came over with chipotle only for himself and sat down on my couch watching a show by himself on his phone. I ate chips for dinner, and then we went to bed. I woke up and did classes online because I wasn’t well. It was about 9, and I offered to make him coffee and food because I was hungry, he said no. And then he said he was heading out. And I cried. And then we broke up. His only contestation was that he needs to be told over and over again. I just can’t do that.  

Am I crazy for wanting someone who’s there not only physically, but is willing to help me when I need it? I loved that he would always show up. But he’d show up to just get his affection he wanted and then leave. I can’t even imagine how having kids in the future would have been like with him. But I love him, and I wish he could’ve been the guy to hold my hair back when I’m sick or make me a cup of coffee ONCE. Maybe I’m crazy, and that’s really why I wrote this. Was I asking too much? Am I just never gonna meet someone who’s able to do that?",1,1757816101.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

“No problem, bud,” the voice shot back, teasing as always.

I couldn’t help but crack a smile as I hung up. I grabbed my hiking bag, gave it a quick once-over to make sure nothing was missing, then slung it on my back, locked the door, and headed outside.

James was waiting on the curb in his Tacoma. As I approached the truck, I noticed an open can of Monster Energy sitting in the cupholder. Knowing him, he’d already drained half of it.

“Hey there young man,” James called with a wicked grin as I got closer. “How much do you charge for an hour?”

After tossing my bag in the back and climbing into the passenger seat, I smirked and shot back, “Fuck off.”

Satisfied, we began the long four-hour drive to the Sunshine Coast Trail.

I was born and raised in British Columbia, Canada. The Pacific Northwest has always been my home—a place of towering evergreens, mist curling through the valleys, and the kind of crisp, resin-scented air that clears your lungs with every breath. For as long as I can remember, those deep woodland greens have given me comfort.

It wasn’t until a few years ago, though, that I began to explore the land more deliberately. Hiking started small: modest 6 km (3.7 mile) trails like Jugg Island and Buzzsaw Falls, the kind you can finish in a morning and still be home in time for lunch. Gradually, my ambitions stretched farther. I found myself drawn to more demanding treks—like Black Tusk, with its jagged silhouette stabbing the skyline, one of the first that truly tested me.

Each year, I raised the stakes a little higher. Each trail left me hungry for the next. This trip was no exception. We had planned it months in advance.

The longest trail in Canada, the Sunshine Coast Trail stretches a whopping 180 km (112 miles), winding through a remarkable variety of landscapes—ancient rainforests thick with moss, rugged alpine ridges, quiet coastlines, and hushed streams tucked into shadowed valleys. What sets this trail apart is its hut-to-hut system. Scattered along the route are roughly sixteen backcountry huts, each offering weary hikers a roof and a place to rest before continuing their journey. It was the beginning of September, where the weather was just starting to cool, and summer relented to fall.

The goal was to complete the hike in ten days. It should have gone off without a hitch—*should have been* the key word.

The Tacoma rumbled onto the highway, its tires drumming a steady rhythm against the asphalt. Morning light spilled through the windshield in golden bands, flickering as we passed stands of evergreens. The city fell away behind us, its concrete and noise replaced by winding roads, mist-hung valleys, and the occasional glimpse of ocean winking silver through the trees.

We rolled the windows down, letting the air rush in—cool and damp, carrying the faint tang of salt from the coast. James nursed his drink, one hand on the wheel, while I leaned back against the seat, letting the hum of the engine and the blur of passing scenery pull me into a quiet calm. The farther we drove, the more the world seemed to loosen its grip: no emails, no buzzing phones, no deadlines. Just the open road and the promise of what lay ahead.

“How’s Kelly?” I asked after a few moments of comfortable silence.

“She’s great!” James lit up instantly, his voice warm and unguarded. “We’re still figuring out when to hold the wedding. And she’s only a year away from finishing her master’s in engineering. I swear, man, she’s the smartest person on the planet.”

I could hear the pride in his voice, and I was genuinely happy for him. Still, a flicker of envy stirred in my chest. He was engaged; I was still single. He owned his apartment, I rented mine.

I know they say comparison is the thief of joy, but I couldn’t help myself. James had always seemed a step ahead. In the last couple of years, I could feel him drifting further from me, which is part of why I leapt at the chance to do this long-ass hike together.

He immigrated to BC from Newfoundland when he was seven. On his first day of elementary school, I saw him sitting alone, absorbed in a set of plastic dinosaurs. I walked over, asked if the T-Rex could beat the Triceratops, and just like that, we hit it off. Nearly twenty years later, we’re still best friends.

At 6’5 and nearly 230 pounds, James was hard to miss. A true Newfoundlander through and through, with thick brown hair covering most of his body and a beard that seemed to grow faster than he could shave, he looked less like a man and more like some wild thing dragged in from the woods. Though he was on the bigger side, a near decade of playing rugby ensured his cardio was on par, if not better, then mine.

The rest of the drive passed in an easy blur. James and I talked about everything and nothing—the newest video games, ridiculous animal facts, half-baked political takes. The conversation wandered without direction, the way it always did, but that was the comfort of it. With James, nothing was ever off the table.

About an hour from the trailhead, we rolled into a lonely gas station off the highway. The neon sign buzzed faintly in the morning haze, promising fuel, coffee, and sugar in equal measure.

“Want anything?” I asked as I unbuckled my seatbelt.

“Another Monster and some beef jerky would be great,” James said.

I snorted. “With a diet like yours, how are you still alive?”

He didn’t even blink. “Spite.”

I shook my head and pushed open the door while James stayed behind to fill up the truck. Inside, the air smelled faintly of burnt coffee and cleaning solution. I grabbed a Monster, jerky, a couple protein bars, candy, and two muffins, piling them into my arms before dropping everything onto the counter.

The cashier looked ancient, her face a map of deep lines, her thinning gray hair twisted into a bun at the back of her head. She moved slowly, methodically, scanning each item one at a time. While she worked, I let my eyes wander. Behind her, tacked to the wall, was a cluttered community board, its surface crowded with fading flyers and curling papers. One of them caught my eye—a missing-person poster, tacked crookedly to the corkboard. Unlike the faded garage-sale ads and yellowing church notices, this one looked fresh, the paper still crisp, the ink dark. Two faces stared back at me.

 One was a man, he looked to be in his early fifties, shaggy black hair streaked with gray and stuffed beneath a baseball cap. The photo had been snapped mid-laugh, probably at some game—his wide grin a frozen moment of joy.

Beside him was a younger boy, maybe eighteen. His photo seemed more candid, taken at a beach. Shirtless, slightly pudgy, his ghost-pale skin stood out against the sunlit backdrop, a sharp contrast to his shoulder-length black hair that clung damply to his neck. His eyes were wide, unguarded, brimming with an innocence that felt almost out of place against the somber context of the poster. There was something unfinished in his gaze, like the promise of a life that had barely begun.

Beneath their photos, bold block letters read:

**MISSING**  
Ronald Varg (52) and son, Steven Varg (18).  
Last seen: July, traveling Sunshine Coast trail  
If you have any information, please contact—

“Such a shame,” came a withered feminine voice, jolting me out of my thoughts.

I looked up. The cashier had paused mid-scan, her wrinkled hands hovering over the register. “They came in here a couple months ago,” she said, shaking her head slowly. “Seemed like such nice folks. Damn shame about that bear attack.”

My eyes narrowed, refocusing on her. “You think a bear got them?”

“That’s what they’re saying.” She leaned forward slightly, as if letting me in on a secret. “They found their camp about three-quarters of the way up the trail. Tent ripped wide open—huge hole in the side. Bits of bone, clothing, dried blood… scattered all over the place, but no bodies.”

There was a strange lilt to her tone, a spark of excitement threading through the horror. Out here, I guessed, stories like this were currency. Company was rare, and tragedy—even second-hand—was something to talk about.

She straightened up, shaking her head again. “If it wasn’t a bear,” she said, her voice trailing off into something almost gleeful, “then I don’t know what could’ve done that kind of damage.”

“I guess I’ll keep my bear spray close by at all times,” I said with a half-hearted chuckle, eager to steer us away from the topic.

The old woman gave me a knowing nod, her expression unreadable. She slid the last muffin across the scanner, the machine beeping sharply in the quiet store. “That’ll be twenty-six seventy-eight,” she said.

I pulled a couple crumpled bills from my wallet, trading it for a thin paper bag that sagged under the weight of caffeine and sugar. The cashier handed me my change with papery fingers, her eyes lingering on me just a moment too long, as if she wanted to say more but thought better of it.

“Have a good hike,” she finally said, the words carrying a weight that felt more like warning than farewell.

As I stepped back into the morning light, James was just sliding the fuel hose into its holster. He noticed me coming and lifted his brows in a quick, wordless greeting.

“Got everything?” he asked once I tossed the bag of food onto the back seat.

“Yeah,” I said, shutting the door. Then, after a pause: “Oh, by the way… we have bear spray, right?”

James gave me a look—head tilted, brow furrowed, like he was trying to figure out if I was joking. We climbed into the truck.

“Of course. Picked up a brand new can a couple weeks ago,” he said. “Why?”

I told him about the cashier, the missing persons poster, and her story of the shredded campsite halfway up the trail. As I spoke, James kept his eyes on the road, his usual smirk fading into a more thoughtful line.

When I finished, he let out a long breath through his nose, then glanced at me, one hand tightening slightly on the wheel. “Sounds like a hell of a way to go, doesn’t it?”

The rest of the drive we tried to outdo each other with tales of the worst ways to die—being eaten alive by swarms of insects, flayed and left in the desert, boiled alive in some ancient bronze cauldron. Each story got darker, more grotesque, but we laughed anyway, the way people laugh when they know the subject should be off-limits. The truck groaned as James threw it into park. We had made it.

James hopped out of the truck and began rummaging through his bag.  
“Two seconds, buddy,” he muttered, digging around with the focus of a man who had buried treasure in there. “Promised I’d give the old battleaxe a call when we got to the trailhead.”

With a small grunt of triumph, he pulled out a satellite phone. It wasn’t anything fancy—scuffed casing, bulky antenna, the kind of tech built for utility, not looks. He began thumbing the buttons before stepping a few paces away for reception.

James stepped a few paces away, holding the bulky satellite phone like it was some sacred relic. He jabbed at a few buttons, waited, then spoke, his voice low and clipped so I couldn’t make out every word.

“What are you wearing?” he growled, a shit eating grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Yup, all good so far, no issues. Yep… yep, we’ve got the food, the gear… everything’s set.” He paused, listening, then nodded. “Don’t worry babe, we’ll check in every couple day. Love you too.”

He ended the call, sliding the phone back into his bag with a satisfied nod.

I watched him, noting the faint tension in his shoulders as he exhaled. It was the kind of precaution that reminded me we weren’t just heading into a normal hike. Out here, the wilderness had its own rules. Then we set off.

When planning a long, multi-day hike, every ounce counts. Too much weight on your back and every step becomes a slog. James and I had tried to plan for everything, weighing each item against its necessity.

My pack was a carefully curated collection of essentials: food—mostly canned, dried, smoked, or bagged goods like trail mix and candy—water bottles, a couple changes of clothes, lightweight tent, sleeping bag, flashlight, first aid kit, small hatchet, can opener, and bug spray, and a water filter bladder.

It was a simple yet brilliant design: fill the bladder with water, hang it from a tree, connect the tube to your bottle, and in ten or fifteen minutes, you had clean, safe drinking water. The thing was almost magical in its simplicity, a little slice of civilization in the middle of the wild.

James’s pack told a different story. Where mine was organized and precise, his seemed to reflect his personality: big, bulky, a little chaotic, but somehow perfectly functional. He had his own food stash—energy bars, beef jerky, a half-empty bag of chips he insisted “was essential”—plus a tangle of ropes, a small cooking skillet, and a sleeping bag stuffed into a compression sack that looked like it had seen better days.

Despite the differences, it worked. Our packs balanced out in weight, and more importantly, they reflected the balance between us—my meticulous caution, his laid-back confidence.

Together, we were ready to take on the trail. After about an hour of walking, we arrived at Sarah Point Shack, the first of the shelters offered along the route. Perched atop a rocky ridge, it overlooked the Salish Sea, the water stretching out in endless silver-blue waves. I could already imagine the sunset painting the sky in shades of gold and crimson, though that moment was still hours away.

The shack itself was small but sturdy—weathered wood, a tin roof, and a simple porch that jutted over the cliff’s edge. It was quiet here, almost reverent, the kind of silence that made you hyper-aware of every creak in the floorboards and whisper of the wind through the pines.

James set down his pack with a grunt and stretched his arms above his head. “Not a bad spot for a first stop,” he said, scanning the horizon with a grin. We stopped for a quick sip from our water bottles, the forest quiet around us. That’s when I noticed James’s eyes light up.

“Oh! I completely forgot to show you!” he said, nearly bouncing with excitement. He dove back into his bag like a kid on Christmas morning and pulled out a flare gun.

“Where the hell did you get that?” I asked, a wide grin spreading across my face.

“Cabela’s,” he said, almost shyly, as if admitting it was a guilty pleasure.

The flare gun was a striking sight: a bright blood-red barrel, a warm brown stock, and a bright shade of yellow on the hammer.

James held it carefully in both hands, his grin never fading. “It’s already loaded,” he explained, as if reading my mind. “For emergencies.”

“That safe?” I asked, one eyebrow arched. “What if it goes off in your bag?”

James shrugged casually. “Then I’ll probably burst into flames,” he said, deadpan.

I stared at him for a moment, half horrified, half amused. “Alrighty then,” I muttered, shaking my head with a grin.

He just laughed, tucking the flare gun back into his pack like it was the most normal thing in the world. The forest around us remained quiet, oblivious to us. We set off down the trail once more. It was nearly 10am, and we wanted to cover a good distance before nightfall. Most of the time, we walked in silence, letting the forest speak for itself.

Birdsong drifted down from high in the canopy, bright and melodic, though the dense mossy trees often hid the singers from view, though the moss-draped trees often hid the singers from sight. Sunlight filtered through the leaves in shifting patterns, warming patches of the trail while leaving others in cool shadow. We lost the path more than once—the trailhead wasn’t always clear—and had to double back in search of it. The thick, trees made navigation difficult, every direction looking much the same. I could imagine a less experienced hiker getting turned around in here. The earthy scent of damp soil and pine filled the air, grounding us in the rhythm of the hike. Around 1 p.m., we passed Bliss Portage Hut, eight kilometers behind us, and by 4 p.m., we had reached Manzanita Bluff, another eight kilometers further. We were making solid progress, the miles accumulating steadily beneath our boots.

Just after 6 p.m., as darkness began to settle over the forest, we decided it was time to make camp for the night. Although it had rained only a few days before, a fire ban was still in effect, so we set up our tents quietly, the wet earth soft beneath our feet.

Dinner was simple—muffins and cold chili—but it filled the void. My body was completely drained, every muscle aching, and I used a splash of water to rinse the sweat from my forehead. The cool trickle was a small mercy against the heat that still clung to me from the day’s climb. Around us, the forest grew hushed as the last light thinned, shadows stretching long between the trees. Night was coming quickly, and tomorrow’s trail would demand every ounce of strength we could gather.

We passed the time with cards under the soft glow of James’s electric lantern. After he threw a half-serious fit about losing every round, we finally surrendered the game and called it a night.

Outside, the moon hung in its third quarter—a perfect balance of light and shadow. Its pale silver glow spilled across the forest, tracing the canopy in delicate highlights while the valleys below sank into darkness. It looked serene, like the skys own lantern suspended in the vast black, steady and unhurried. The stars around it glittered brighter in the absence of its full light, together casting the night in quiet, tender beauty—half moonlight, half mystery.

With groggy goodnights, we slipped into our tents, the forest breathing softly around us.

I lay there in the dark for a while, the fabric of the tent pressing softly against me, my thoughts drifting to the two missing hikers from the poster. Their faces, frozen in photographs, mingled with the quiet sounds of the forest outside—rustling leaves, the occasional distant call of an owl.

I clutched my hatchet tightly, feeling its familiar weight against my side, a small comfort in the vast unknown around us. Slowly, the exhaustion of the day tugged at my consciousness, and I drifted off to sleep, the shadow of unease lingering just at the edge of my dreams. Hours passed, and I slept fitfully, half in dreams, half in the quiet awareness of the forest around me. Then I woke.

At first, it was just a faint rustling, almost like the wind brushing against the tent, but it carried a rhythm that didn’t belong to the trees. A pause. A shuffle. Another pause. My heart rate quickened, and I clutched my hatchet tighter, every nerve alert.

Outside, shadows shifted across the tent walls. A low, almost imperceptible snap of a twig made me freeze. I strained my ears, trying to tell if it was an animal—or something else. The forest, which had seemed peaceful and welcoming by day, now felt vast and unknowable, every sound amplified in the darkness.

I told myself it was nothing—a raccoon, a deer, maybe even my imagination—but a small, persistent chill threaded down my spine. Sleep didn’t come easily again that night, and the memory of the missing hikers haunted the edges of my mind, mingling with every creak and whisper of the forest. After wheat seemed like an eternity of sitting there, straining my senses, I herd nothing. Eventually I succumbed to exhaustion and lapsed into blissful unconsciousness.

I awoke just after sunrise and stepped out of my tent, greeted by the sight of James relieving himself onto a nearby bush.

“How’d you sleep?” he asked, craning his neck toward me, urine still streaming between his legs.

“Alright,” I replied, my body still heavy with sleep. I stretched my arms and back, muscles aching from the day before. “Did you hear anything last night?”

James shook his head. “Nothing at all,” he said, finally finishing and zipping up. Then, with his usual grin, he added, “Let’s grab some grub, then hit the trail.”

The next couple of days on the trail passed in a steady, almost meditative rhythm. Step after step, the forest unfolded around us—towering evergreens dusted with moss, ferns brushing against our legs, sunlight filtering through the canopy in shifting patterns. We walked, talked, and paused at intervals to drink and snack, letting the world slow down to the pace of our boots on the trail.

Each day we covered roughly thirty kilometres, our legs aching but our spirits buoyed by the sheer beauty around us. Streams tumbled across the path, their water crystal clear, and we often stopped to fill the water filter, then fill the bottles. Birds called from hidden perches, their songs punctuating the quiet of the forest, while distant waterfalls added a soft, constant hum to the background.

Despite the physical toll, the days felt almost peaceful, the kind of immersion that only long hikes through untouched wilderness can bring. Conversation drifted freely—jokes, memories, speculations about the trail, and plans for the nights ahead.

By the end of the third day, our progress had brought us to Elk Lake Hut. Nestled beside the still, reflective waters of the lake, the hut looked even smaller and more inviting after the long hours of walking. The lake mirrored the surrounding peaks and trees, creating a perfect, almost surreal frame around the simple wooden structure.

We dropped our packs with a collective sigh of relief, the tension of the trail momentarily slipping from our shoulders. For a moment, all that existed was the gentle lapping of the water, the croaking of frogs, the rustle of leaves in the breeze, and the quiet satisfaction of making it this far. Elk Lake Hut would be our home for the night, a small sanctuary in the heart of the wilderness before we pushed onward.

The inside it was simple, but it carried the kind of rugged charm that only backcountry shelters have. The walls were raw timber, their knots and grains catching the light like scars in old skin. In the center, a small wood-burning stove squatted on a metal plate, its surface blackened from years of use. A half-empty box of matches and a bent fire poker lay on top. Along two walls were wooden bunks, one next to the other. Each was fitted with a thin foam pad, the kind that made sleep possible but never luxurious. Carved initials, dates, and little messages were scrawled into the wood next to the beds—testaments to the people who had passed through before. *“2017 – Mike was here”* sat beside *“Cold as hell but worth it”*, and beneath that, a crudely drawn moose.

The windows were streaked with dirt and condensation, but through it you could catch the glimmer of water, still and dark under the fading light.

“Not bad, not bad,” I muttered, more to myself than to James, running my hand along the rough timber wall. “Why don’t we start a fire in the stove and have ourselves a cooked meal?”

“Sounds good to me,” James replied without hesitation, his stomach giving a dramatic growl at the mention of food. He smirked, patting his gut. “If you wanna chop up some wood, I’ll cook it up. First, though, I gotta call my girl.”

I wandered toward the treeline, scanning for dry sticks, while James ambled down toward a small dock that jutted out over the pond. The dock was old—boards gray and splintering, nailed together more with stubbornness than integrity. I watched him idly from the corner of my eye as I hacked at a branch, the sharp crack of wood splitting filling the still air. James pressed the phone to his ear and started pacing the dock, muttering something under his breath, probably waiting for a signal.

Then it happened. Without warning, one of the boards gave way with a sickening crack. His leg plunged straight through the rotten timber.

“Fuck!” James bellowed, lurching sideways. The satellite phone flew out of his grip, arcing just long enough for both of us to realize what was happening before it splashed into the dark water below.

“Shit!” I dropped the sticks and sprinted toward him, but James had already wrenched his leg free with a savage tug. Before I could tell him to leave it, he leapt straight into the pond after the phone.

The water came up to his chest, sending ripples racing across the surface. He froze for a second, sucking in a huge breath, then plunged his head and shoulders under. Bubbles foamed up where he disappeared.

“James!” I shouted, skidding to the pond’s edge, heart hammering.

Seconds later, he erupted from the water, gasping and sputtering, hair plastered to his face. In one dripping fist, he held the satellite phone triumphantly above his head like some absurd prize.

“Got it!” he croaked between coughs, water streaming from his beard and clothes.

“You good, man?” I asked, trying—and failing—to stifle the laugh bubbling up in my throat.

“Yeah, I’m good,” James grumbled, dragging himself out of the pond, boots squelching in the mud. He held the dripping satellite phone like it had personally betrayed him. “But I think this thing is fucked. Waste of three hundred bucks.”

“Let me handle dinner tonight,” I said, trying to soften the sting of his embarrassment. “I don’t have any rice to put it in, but I do have oatmeal. Maybe it’ll suffice?”

James barked out a laugh, shaking his head. “Yeah, maybe. Worth a shot.” He sloshed past me toward the hut, leaving a trail of muddy footprints. I clapped him on the back as he went, his wet clothes squishing with every step, and he gave me a sheepish grin before disappearing inside.

I turned back to the dock, hatchet still dangling loosely in my hand. That’s when I froze.

Across the pond, half-hidden in the trees, a figure was watching us.

It stood unnaturally still, its skin pale as bleached paper, like it hadn’t seen sunlight in years. From where I stood, the distance blurred its features into something unsettling—like a face you know is human but can’t quite recognize. My stomach tightened, a cold ripple running through me.

The figure then turned abruptly, vanishing into the dense treeline with a hurried shuffle.

I stood there for a long moment, the forest suddenly too quiet. The ripples on the pond smoothed into glass. Only the distant call of a raven broke the silence.

I got the fire going in the stove, the first lights of flame crackling to life before spreading into a steady warmth that filled the tiny shelter. James had stripped down and draped his wet clothes—pants, shirt, socks, and boots—across a chair beside the stove, Hopefully, it wouldn’t be long till the fabric dried. He sat slouched on one of the bunks, the battered satellite phone in his hands, poking at it with the kind of stubbornness only born from pure frustration.

“She’s going to be so pissed,” James muttered. “She probably thinks I was attacked by Bigfoot or something.”

“That’s a good way to go,” I teased, stirring a can of pork and beans on the stove until the edges bubbled. “Ripped apart by a mystical beast. Beats dying of old age.”

James snorted but didn’t look up. I poured a portion into a dented tin bowl and handed it to him. He accepted it with a grumble of thanks before digging in.

“Leave it in the oatmeal for a couple days, might do the trick,” I said, half-joking, half-serious, nodding toward the phone.

James gave me a sidelong glance. “Oatmeal resurrection, huh? Worth a shot.”

I cracked the stove door open, tossed another stick onto the fire, and listened to the wood snap and hiss. The hut was warm now, almost cozy, but my eyes kept flicking back toward the window—out into the darkening trees where the pale figure had been.

Later that night, after we’d eaten and James had finally given up on the phone, it lay in a baggy of oatmeal next to his cot. We lay in our bunks listening to the stove’s steady crackle. Sleep came slow.

Somewhere outside, a twig snapped.

My eyes snapped open. The sound was sharp, deliberate, too heavy for the usual night creatures.

For a long moment, nothing followed. Then came the rustle of underbrush, faint but deliberate, circling the hut. I held my breath, straining to hear, heart thumping so loud I swore it would wake James. A low creak groaned against the outer wall, like something brushing past the logs. I lay still in my bed, still as a corpse. Eyes glued on the window on the other side of the hut.

Then slowly, impossibly, a pale face appeared at the glass.

It wasn’t sudden—it eased into view, like someone pressing forward out of the shadows. The skin was chalk white, almost glowing against the black of the forest behind it. No hair. No eyebrows. Just large sunken eyes.

It didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

It looked unreal, like something pasted onto the night itself. My body screamed to wake James, to shout, to run, but all I could do was stare. Then, slowly, the face drifted away from the window.

And did something worse.

The door rattled. Someone—*something*—was trying to get in.

That broke me. I tore free of the sleeping bag, hatchet in one hand, flashlight in the other. My voice cracked the silence: “James! Wake up!”

James jolted upright, confused, as I charged the door like a madman. I wrenched the lock free and threw it open, the beam of my flashlight cutting through the dark. James stumbled up beside me, wearing nothing but his boxers, wielding the fire poker in one hand, lantern in the other, looking like a half-asleep caveman. “Jesus, man,” he muttered, rubbing his face. “What the *fuck* are you doing?”

“The door,” I hissed, pointing at it with the hatchet. “Someone tried to open the door. I saw—” My words faltered, my chest tightening. How could I even explain what that face looked like? It didn’t feel human.

James squinted into the trees, holding up the lantern in front of him, unimpressed. “I don’t see shit. Probably a raccoon or something.”

I didn’t answer. My grip on the flashlight trembled, the circle of light jittering across the treeline.

Then, faint—so faint I almost thought I imagined it—came the sound of *something* retreating deeper into the woods. Not the four-legged scramble of an animal. Two feet, crunching over leaves.

I didn’t sleep much the rest of the night. Every crack, every creak, every branch scratching against the hut’s walls set my nerves on edge. My eyes remained glued to the window, waiting for the visitor to return.

“Damn it!” I woke with a start. Beams of morning light were bleeding in through the windows. James sat on his bed, satellite phone in hand, frown etched across his face.

“Come on, you piece of shit, work!” he muttered, glancing in my direction.

“Oh… morning,” he added distractedly, not noticing my tension. “Sleep okay?”

I tried, and failed, to shake the last vestiges of sleep from my head. “Not really,” I admitted, rubbing my eyes.

I nodded toward the satellite phone. “Still not working, huh?”

“Nope. Might need to be put more in the oatmeal,” he muttered, glancing up at me with a hard look. “We… going to talk about last night?”

Heat rose to my face. Embarrassment hit hard, but I knew I couldn’t let it slide. If I stayed quiet, I’d look like a lunatic.

“Look, man,” I said with a heavy sigh, running a hand through my hair, something I did when stressed, “I’m not crazy. I saw something.”

James stared at me skeptically, eyes locked on mine, searching for any sign that this was some elaborate prank at his expense. After a long beat, he nodded. “Okay… so what was it you saw?”

I hesitated; grateful he was at least listening. “Not exactly sure,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “But it was… skinny. Pale.”

James cracked a wicked grin. “Very original.”

“I’m serious, dude,” I snapped, irritation starting to flare.

James wiggled his fingers at me and pulled a ridiculous face. “It was Slenderman, huh?”

I threw my hands in the air. “I know how crazy it sounds—I’m not making this shit up.”

James put a finger to his ear, mimicking a microphone, and in a mock-reporter voice said, “This just in: local hikers found fucked to death by cliché monster.”

I groaned, running a hand over my face. “You *do* realize this isn’t funny, right?”

James shrugged,

 “I’m serious, James. I saw it. It was *there*.”

James leaned back against the bunk, still smirking, but the humor in his eyes faltered slightly.

I just roll my eyes, “whatever dude, lets just get going” and began gathering up my belongings.

The next couple of kilometers were slow and exhausting. Not only was I sleep-deprived, but every few feet I found myself glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that pale figure lurking behind the trees. Each time, there was nothing—just the swaying of branches and the occasional rustle of unseen wildlife.

By the time the sun was beginning to tilt toward the horizon, around 5 p.m., we were still eight or nine kilometers shy of the next hut. My muscles ached, my pack felt heavier than ever, and yet a small sense of relief began to creep in.

Maybe I hadn’t seen anything at all. Maybe last night had been a trick of shadows and fatigue. For the first time all day, I allowed myself to relax, telling myself this

It felt like just another uneventful stretch of the trail. We set up camp and made do with a simple dinner of protein bars and ketchup chips. Later, we played cards under the weak glow of the lantern. James gloated with every win, his laughter echoing faintly in the stillness, but my mind was elsewhere.

As the shadows stretched long and thick around our small campsite, a creeping unease settled over me. The forest, which had seemed quiet and familiar all day, now felt alive with unseen eyes. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sent a shiver crawling up my spine. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

“Are you going to be okay?” James asked, genuine concern flickering across his face.

“Yeah… yeah, I think so,” I replied, though the tremor in my voice betrayed my unease.

“Well… I’m hitting the hay. If you get eaten alive by this monster, try not to scream too loud—I don’t want my beauty sleep interrupted,” he joked, lightly jabbing me in the arm.

I forced a weak smile, but my eyes drifted to the dark forest surrounding us. The shadows seemed alive, the trees shifting just enough to suggest movement. It felt like the eyes were everywhere, watching my every move, waiting for a moment of weakness to strike. My guard felt impossibly thin, and the night stretched out ahead like a living thing. I slipped into my sleeping bag, trying to convince myself I was just being paranoid. The forest outside seemed impossibly still, but every so often a branch would crack, a leaf would scrape against another, and my pulse would spike. James’ even breathing soon reminded me that he had already dozed off. I envied him, or at least the illusion of peace he seemed to have. I tried to close my eyes, to block out the feeling of eyes pressing in from the darkness.

A few sleepless hours later, the urge to piss became impossible to ignore. I tried to push it down, telling myself to wait, not wanting to step outside into the dark, watching woods. But it was a losing battle.

I muttered a curse under my breath and quietly unzipped my tent flap. Heart thudding, I peeked out, sweeping the flashlight beam across the forest. Shadows stretched and twisted, but nothing moved.

The waning gibbous moon sagged in the sky like a bruised eye, its swollen face leaking pale light across the forest. The glow wasn’t comforting—it was sickly, strained, as though the moon itself were wasting away. Shadows stretched long and crooked under its watch, twisting the trees into warped silhouettes. Every patch of silver light felt like exposure, like being dragged under its gaze, while the darkness between seemed to crawl closer, eager to swallow what the moon abandoned.

Slowly, I stepped out of the safety of my tent, every nerve on edge, and moved to relieve myself, ears straining for the slightest sound. The forest felt impossibly still, yet every instinct screamed that I wasn’t truly alone. After I finished, I turned to head back to my tent—and froze. The beam of my flashlight caught it, partially hidden behind a tree. Its bald, egg-shaped head tilted slightly, pale and wide eyed, staring straight at me.

“Fuck!” I shouted, the flashlight shaking in my hands. My grip tightened around the hatchet, every muscle coiled, ready to charge if it stepped closer. The forest seemed to hold its breath, the usual night sounds fading into an unnatural silence.

I could feel my pulse hammering in my ears, each heartbeat a deafening drum. The figure didn’t move—just watched, impossibly still, as if assessing whether I was a threat.

Then, a bony hand emerged from behind the tree, followed by a weak, quivering voice: “Please… I’m lost.”

If I hadn’t just peed, I probably would have soiled myself right then.

By now, James was emerging from his tent, lantern in hand, rubbing sleep from his eyes. His gaze fell on the figure, and he staggered back in terror. “Fucking hell!” he screamed. “What the fuck is that?”

“Please don’t hurt me,” the creature said, its voice fragile. “I haven’t seen another person in so long… please. I mean you no harm.”

My pulse still racing, I forced myself to take a step forward. Summoning every ounce of courage, I shouted, “Come out where we can see you!”

Ever so slowly, it emerged from behind the tree, pale features fully revealed, its movements deliberate and cautious. It looked like a walking skeleton, skin stretched taut over bone, caked in dirt and mud. Its body was completely hairless—no hair on its head, face, or body, not even eyebrows. like Cormac McCarthy’s infamous character, the Judge, if he was liberated from Auschwitz.

I noticed, uncomfortably, that it had no clothes, leaving its thin, frail form fully exposed. The sight made my stomach churn, but I forced myself to focus, trying to understand whether it truly meant any harm. “Who… who are you?” I asked, voice steadier than I felt.

It gestured to itself, long, bony fingers curling awkwardly, and rasped. “My name… is David Varg,”",3,1757815765.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

We have talked about marriage but really, i dont have any special want to get married again. I am extremely active and take a few supplements, one of which has the side effect of making your bowel movements hard, dense, and ball like.
This is not normally something i would even think about, honestly, when i go, its clean, quick, and requires very little wipeing. However, i eat a high fiber/bulk diet, so....I make a lot of poop. Twice every morning.
I stay the night with my boyfriend a couple times a month. He gets up early and so do I. Here lies the problem. His toilet, for whatever reason, has a very small,...flush hole. It is like the diameter of a half cup measuring cup. My shit will NOT go down. The bedoom we sleep in is adjoined to the bathroom, so my cursings and struggles with the plunger are obvious. So look, im an adult, hes an adult, but for fucks sake, i stop his toilet up EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME. Its so goddamed irritating. Like,  yes we love each other but some things are better left to the imagination.So, my solution has been, to catch my shit in a gigantic wat of tp i have wrapped around my hand, throwing it in a plastic bag, then taking it to the neighborhood dumpster. 
This has worked fine, kind of gross and awkward, but hey, it beats having to make your partner plunge the toilet for 5 min to free your shit at 5am, when you gotta get up at 6.
One weekend, his son from his previous marriage was spending the night with him, i love the kid, he is cool and really needs an adult female figure. 
I had gotten up early (430ish), and was maki g coffee. The kid gets up and goes into the bathroom, then back to bed. Soon, i have to go, and it was...a lot.  Sone went down, but most didnt.Definitely needed the bag treatment.  Just as i was making the plan, my partner gets up and is REALLY needing to use the bathroom, i guess something he ate the night before wasn't agreeing with him. I panicked and said "" yes, im in here, but ..i just came to pee and there's some poop in the toilet and it seems to be stopped up""
*Insert childs name here* was just in here, i guess he stopped it up"". 
After like 20 fucking min of plunging, it finially was unclogged. Of course he wasn't mad at his kid, but later that day i heard him telling him that ""if you poop and it doesn't go down, you need to tell one of us"". ....""Dad i didnt poop""....

For context (for anyone new):
I met this woman at my gym a while back. She’s married, living with her husband and kid, and she gave me her number. Out of the blue, she told me she’s “going through a divorce.” But she hasn’t filed anything, still lives with him, has no solid income (just part-time work), and at one point claimed she didn’t want alimony or child support, which sounded like total BS.

We even went on a coffee date once, and honestly, I kept getting hints that she wanted more. But after thinking it through (and some advice here), I decided not to pursue anything. Too many red flags, way too much drama.

Now for the update:
I ran into her outside the gym today. She asked where I’d been, and I told her I injured my foot and stayed away. We caught up, and she said she’s *already started her moving process* and found a spot **100 miles away**.

Here’s where I’m confused:

* I last saw her Monday. Four days later she’s magically found a place and started moving?
* She hasn’t filed for divorce.
* She works part-time with no real income.
* She keeps repeating she doesn’t want alimony or child support, which makes no sense.

So, my theory: is she just telling me these things to bait me in? Like, if I ever hooked up with her, could she flip it later and claim something wild like I got her pregnant, or worse?

It feels like she’s constantly lying and shifting her story. She grew up in the city, and part of me wonders if she knows how to play people.

What do you guys think? Am I being paranoid, or is there some “endgame” with all these lies that I should be wary of?

1ngf45o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ngf45o/am_i_overreacting_because_someone_pssed_all_over/,Am I Overreacting because someone p*ssed all over my seat and nobody's confessing.,"I, 20f live in an apartment with three men 26M, 29M and UnknownM (I'm assuming 26-29 though) I'm just gonna call him UM because that's fitting. And a 22F woman. Me and the girl have our rooms on the far left side of the apartment, and the boys rooms are in the far right side, while there's a small kitchen, and two bathrooms in the middle. The bigger one the boys share, and the girls share the smaller one. In our contract it was stated that nobody would use the others bathrooms, and that's been followed specifically until today. 

I'm closest with 26M as we've had the most conversations and a few furniture or outside the house trips, and then kinda close with 22F because of the fact that I found her as a roommate so, we talked before we moved in. And have a neutral, but decent relationship with 29M.

I woke up this morning at 9:15 am and I go to the bathroom only to find that the whole entire seat was absolutely covered in urine. It was sprayed all over and had even gotten on the lid of my trashcan next to the seat. 

I immediately text 22F and since she doesn't respond I text 26M. 26M comes out and states that he had just gotten out of the shower about 5 minutes prior and his hair is wet to confirm that. He looks at the toilet and is absolutely appalled. I explain that I suspect that someone needed to use the bathroom while 26M was in the shower, and went in and used the girls, and decided to supersoak it and not flush. The pee in the toilet is still foamy and bubbly, and the seat is actively wet, making me think it was recent. There's no toilet paper in the toilet, making me pretty confident it was a man and not a woman. 

26M also states that the boys bathroom doesn't ever get that bad and agrees with me that whoever did use the bathroom seemed to have intentionally hit the seats and trashcan, and that it looks like more than just splatter or dribble. 

I'm a slight germaphobe when it comes to things that aren't mine. And cleaning up someone elses urine is like, number one thing I do not ever want to do. And I have three brothers so, I grew up litterally bombarding them into sitting, the ""who p\*ssed on the seat"" game is not unfamiliar to me. 

After about an hour, 22F has still not responded, and I don't want this p\*ss to keep sitting there, so I decide to text the groupchat, I text ""hey guys, did any of the boys use the girls bathroom?"" I get no response but I coincidentally walk into the kitchen where 29M and UM both are, and I decide I might as well ask them right then. I ask

""Hey did either of you use the girls bathroom this morning?"" UM responds a huffy ""No"" and then leaves the apartment. 29M responds ""No"" as well, but is continuing to do stuff in the kitchen. So I ask, ""Like at 9 this morning?"" to which he responds ""I was in the shower at 9."" Which I'm skeptical of because I did in fact see 26M with wet hair. 

At around 1pm 22F finally get's back to me, stating she left at 7:30 this morning and did not have anybody over last night, and that the p\*ss was not there when she left, further confirming my theory that it happened between 9-9:18. Now I am really upset because now I know somebody has lied to me. 

I'm pretty confident it's not 26M as he was litterally there during the whole thing pretty much, and in the shower when I suspect it happened, and as 29M is the next one I'm closest with I text him. ""Hey can you confirm to me what time you woke up this morning? I'm just trying to figure out what happened with this whole thing"" 

We then talk in the kitchen and it seems like he's upset with me in a way, saying I'm accusing people of using the bathroom when ""the men don't do that"" and that everyone was respecting eachothers spaces. When I explain to him that it was definitely a man who p\*ssed on the seat and everybody is saying they didn't, and showed him the picture to show it was not in fact like a dribble but arson with p\*ss, I think he understood a litle better why I was upset, but then continued to talk about how I'm talking to everybody privately and how we need to all get together as a group and have a conversation about how the whole living area has been disgusting lately in general. 

He then goes on to say that he has been having problem's with someone peeing on the seat since 26M moved in, and that I may be accusing the wrong person. He also says that he is pretty sure he took a shower after 26M and talked about how he did see the water on the floor and stuff I mentioned in my theory of the shower. So I think 29M took a shower at around 9:35 after I had already gone to my room, and I know that's about when because I called 22F. 

My main suspect is UM because UM refuses to talk to me, he's a conservative man, and I suspect that he might believe that if he speaks to me, it would be going against his girlfriend or something. But that's just my assumptions. 26M has also been seeing UM take my cups for his coffee, when I have already said that I am not sharing my dishes, and only my pots and pans. When I texted the groupchat reminding them that my dishes weren't for sharing, everyone responded to me except for UM. As well as everytime I run into UM and try to make small talk he straight up ignores me. He also constantly moves other peoples stuff onto my space, and claims people are moving things onto his space which is the ONE counter in our whole kitchen, he's taken up the whole thing with his air fryer, coffee machine, and rice cooker. I bought another counter/cabinet thing to try and make more space and have stated people can use the space for cooking but not for storage, and I keep all my stuff in that space. 26M has also had some problems with UM knocking on the bathroom door asking if ""he's done"" while he's in the middle of showering. And 26M takes short showers too. And that's why I suspect UM the most. 

29M then stated that the same things I say about UM, UM says about me, that I don't say hi to him and that I seem cold, and that I move things on ""his space"" (the ONE SHARED COUNTER) But I say that regardless of everything I have already asked everybody and everybody has said it wasn't them, and so now someone is definitely lying and that's what I'm mad about. It's then that I start to get extremely like, aware of the situation I am in, being the youngest woman in a household of men who have been adulting for a whole decade already, and start to feel like I'm maybe being talked down to or manipulated. Needless to say 29M agrees to text the groupchat to discuss group duties.

About an hour later 22F comes home and everyone's here except UM, and everyones agreed to have a meeting except UM, and we all have a meeting except UM, about chores and stuff. 29M tells us the stove is disgusting, tells 26M that his hair get's everywhere in the bathroom, and it results in us creating a chore chart and 26M going and cleaning the mens bathroom. I am now annoyed with this chore chart as, my old roommates and I functioned fine without a chore chart just cleaning up after ourselves, and now having to clean up after men, especially if it's a big mess I have not created, I can already tell I'm going to get tense. 

Plus I am already pretty confident most of the mess is from UM, he's the one with the rice cooker, and there's rice in the sink, rice on the stove, and he's also the only one who consistently cooks, 22F doesn't cook at ALL, and 29M and I mainly cook eggs. And I just don't think it's fair that we had this whole group discussion without UM. 

I wound up cleaning up the p\*ss myself.

I've texted 26M and he confirmed that UM has come home now and made no effort of course to respond to the groupchat. 22F is gone all night and we were going to talk to UM together, and I don't want to bring this situation up again but it was really gross. I don't have a problem with someone using my bathroom if they really need to, but to pee everywhere, and not flush, and then not even admit to it? I'm debating texting my realtor. But I have no way to confirm who it was. 

I want to ask UM again if he used the bathroom this morning, but considering he already said no, I don't know if it's going to do anything.

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Desperation**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in Sweden, math doesn’t lie (unless you’re trying to calculate why meatballs are the only food group). The odds for this match paint a clear picture: Östers IF is the favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **47%** (based on decimal odds of 2.1–2.2). IFK Värnamo? They’re the underdog, with a **26–33%** chance to win, depending on the bookmaker. The draw? A tidy **28–29%**, which feels about right for a game where both teams are fighting for survival.

The spread is a half-goal in Östers’ favor (-0.25), meaning bookmakers think they’ll win or at least avoid a loss. The totals? A lukewarm **2.75 goals**, with slightly better odds on the Under. This isn’t a fireworks show—it’s more of a tense chess match between two teams who’d settle for a tie if it keeps them from falling into the abyss.

**Digesting the News: Stale Breads and Long-Dormant Volcanoes**  
Now, let’s unpack the context. Östers IF is in a relegation battle that feels like a game of Jenga. They’re just **one point ahead of Öster**, and with a win here, they could create a buffer. Meanwhile, IFK Värnamo is clinging to hope like a Swede clings to their coffee during a polar vortex. Their recent form? Well, they’ve been about as consistent as a Swedish summer—unpredictable, but at least it’s not snowing.

Meanwhile, Örebro SK’s recent two-game winning streak (after 314 days of futility) proves that even the most cursed teams can find their groove. Could IFK Värnamo be next? Possibly. But let’s not get ah

If board games are more your style, we’ll have favorites like Monopoly, Scrabble, Connect 4, Uno, Jenga, Sorry!, and Guess Who. Whether you want something competitive, silly, or lighthearted, there will be plenty of options to join in.

Later in the night, we’ll turn things up with karaoke! It’s a chance to grab the mic, sing your heart out, and share some laughs. Karaoke is totally optional, so you can perform or just cheer on friends.

We’ll also have pizza and soft drinks available. A $2 food fee covers pizza and soda but isn’t required. Admission is $5 per person, which helps cover the rental of the coffee shop space from the owner of Marine Park Coffee. Pizza will also be available for $2 a slice.

Between the games, karaoke, food, and community vibe, this event has something for everyone and is a great way to connect with other young adults in southern Brooklyn.

My wife (34F) and I (30M) just moved to Charlotte (Waxhaw) with our 5-month-old daughter in July to be closer to my parents. As you can imagine, nobody wants their only friends to be their parents, but also hard to do activities with a newborn.

Huge sports fan - started watching when I was a kid with my parents. Celtics fan, sad Yankees fan. Also love UFC and Boxing.

Big foodie. My wife and I love exploring different restaurants, it’s how we bond. I also like to cook and grill. Seafood, Indian, Thai, southern…down for everything.

Love the idea of outdoor concerts, especially in the fall. Starting to get into country music. 

Also love the gym, although it’s been harder since my daughter was born. Used to lift 5-6 times a week.

Down for a beer? Coffee? Watch the (any) game? Grab a bite? I’m down

Dream setup kumbaga.

Pero after 3 months, eto napansin ko:

Environment – sobrang tahimik na minsan nawawalan ako ng gana. Sanay ako sa ingay ng coffee shops sa Manila.

Family expectations – dahil nasa bahay lang ako, iniisip ng mga magulang ko na pwede akong utusan anytime “Pakidala nga nito kay tita”, “Ikaw na magsundo sa pamangkin” 🤦‍♂️

Work-life balance – ironically, mas nararamdaman ko na halos 24/7 ako naka-online dito, kasi wala nang clear separation ng bahay at trabaho.

Ang weird lang kasi nung nasa Manila ako, kahit may traffic at stress, parang mas driven ako. Ngayon, kahit may “ideal setup,” parang mas nakaka-burnout pa.

Today was day 2 of 300mg (up from 150mg). The initial nausea had subsided but is back with a vengeance and the jittery/restless/anxious/on-edge feeling is horrible. Even on 150mg, I felt like my body was buzzing, and now it’s (understandably) worse. It’s 9:40pm and my heart is pounding. To note, this doesn’t start in the morning with my coffee, but hours afterwards when I’ve switched to non-caffeinated beverages. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

1ngerav,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngerav,Trying Every Zoologist Fragrance- Day 12,"The wheel has chosen Chameleon and Civet as my day 12 test.
After spraying on my skin(one in the morning and one in the evening) and letting it settle for 3 hours, here is my review.

Morning: Chameleon

What it smells like:
You’re on the beach in a tropical destination. You’re sipping on a Pina Colada, surrounded by palms and tropical flora. (I can’t do better for this one I’m sorry)

My opinion: 
I REALLY wanted to like this one. It sounds like something I would love. I just don’t think it fit with my skin chemistry well. At first I got another strong cat pee smell, it then mellowed out into a nice tropical coconut mango mix. Later on it smelled a bit woody. I based my description on the part with the tropical coconut which is what I wish it smelled like the entire time :( this one was unfortunately a disappointment. 

BF’s opinion: 
Smells like a diaper. (I asked him for more info and he said he can’t give me any more info)

Would we wear it: No

Rated: 3.5/10


Evening: Civet

What it smells like:
You are visiting an old coffee house in your town. The rugs are outdated and the booths are worn down. An old looking cat sits in the window watching you from afar. You order a hot coffee, black. The smell of the beans being roasted fill up the room, inviting you to a warm evening.

My opinion:
Imagine my surprise when I actually enjoyed the scent that I despised in the other fragrances that included it. Civet is a spicy warm cup of coffee. It stinks in the way that an old antique shop would. After it dried down for a few hours it smelled exactly like my cat does. A little stinky but also very comforting. I liked the smell but would not prefer it on a person.

BF’s opinion: 
Smells like cinnamon. He likes it.

Would we wear it: No

Rated: 6/10

We’re renting an Airbnb in the Alto Vista area. I asked ChatGPT to create an Itinerary for me. What do you Aruba vets think of it? 

Here’s a 6-day Aruba itinerary that balances relaxation at your Alto Vista Airbnb with sightseeing, beach time, and a touch of adventure. Since you have a car, you’ll be able to explore at your own pace without overdoing it.

⸻

🌴 Day 1 – Arrival & Settle In
	•	Arrive in Aruba, pick up rental car.
	•	Stop at a supermarket (Super Food Plaza or Ling & Sons) for basics/snacks for the Airbnb.
	•	Unwind at your Alto Vista Airbnb pool.
	•	Sunset dinner nearby: Barefoot Restaurant (beachfront, casual but romantic).

⸻

🏖️ Day 2 – Palm Beach & California Lighthouse 
	•	Easy morning by the pool.
	•	Late morning: Palm Beach – rent chairs/umbrella, try paddleboarding or just float in the calm water.
	•	Lunch on Palm Beach: Eduardo’s Beach Shack (fresh bowls/smoothies).
	•	Afternoon drive to the California Lighthouse – explore dunes and take in views.
	•	Dinner: The Pelican Nest (on a pier, great seafood).

⸻

🌊 Day 3 – Catamaran Sail & Eagle Beach 
	•	Morning/early afternoon: Catamaran snorkel & sail excursion (many depart from Palm Beach; 4-hour sails usually include snorkeling at Antilla shipwreck & Malmok).
	•	After sail: relax on Eagle Beach (wide, soft sand, famous divi divi trees).
	•	Dinner: Yemanja Woodfired Grill in Oranjestad (reservation recommended).

⸻

🏜️ Day 4 – Natural Wonders & Relaxation 
	•	Morning drive to Arikok National Park.
	•	Stop at Guadirikiri Cave & Fontein Cave (rock formations & cave paintings).
	•	Optional: detour to Natural Bridge ruins or Dos Playa beach for a look.
	•	Head back mid-afternoon for pool downtime.
	•	Casual dinner near Alto Vista or Noord – Local Store (burgers & wings, laid-back vibe).

⸻

🍷 Day 5 – Winery & Hidden Beach 
	•	Sleep in, enjoy coffee at the pool.
	•	Midday visit to Aruba Ostrich Farm or head straight to Aruba Wine & Dine’s The Wine Room (Oranjestad – wine tasting experience).
	•	Afternoon beach stop: Arashi Beach (quieter, good snorkeling).
	•	Sunset cocktails at Moomba Beach Bar.
	•	Dinner: Driftwood (authentic local seafood, Oranjestad).

⸻

☀️ Day 6 – Your Way + Farewell 
	•	Flex day for favorites:

She seemed totally normal in person — we hung out a couple of times and she’s even been to my apartment. But online, her behavior has been extremely strange.

Over the past few days, I noticed more and more people I know — even old friends from high school back in the U.S. — suddenly following her. At first, I thought it was just because I had posted her on my story, but when I asked her about it, she denied having followed anyone first and said they must’ve just found her through me.

After asking around, I learned that wasn’t true. She had actually gone through my followers, followed them first, and then unfollowed after she got follow backs. I checked more closely and realized she had followed over 600 people tied to me within a week. She also spam-liked posts while doing this.

On top of that, I had casually mentioned to her that I have an Amazon wishlist and a Buy Me a Coffee page — both of which are linked on my Instagram. Now she has both of those exact things in her Linktree as well.

The whole situation feels invasive and unsettling, like she combed through my profile heavily and is intentionally trying to insert herself into my social space. I confronted her once about the old friends following her, and she denied it, which just made me feel worse.

I don’t even know what to think. Is this just really desperate clout-chasing? Or could this indicate deeper issues like instability or poor boundaries? Has anyone experienced anything similar, and how seriously would you take it?

1ngejp2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngejp2,Anthropic just dropped a feature that lets Claude connect to all the apps on your phone.  It works and it's awesome!  Here are some top use cases and pro tips on using this feature,"**TLDR:** Claude can now directly connect to your phone's apps including calendar, messaging, maps, and task managers. This means you can have Claude schedule meetings, draft messages, find locations, and organize your tasks without switching apps. Currently appears to be rolling out on mobile (iOS/Android).  We're moving from ""Claude, what should I do?"" to ""Claude, please do it.""

# Claude's App Integration is Here - Everything You Need to Know

Claude just dropped what might be the most practical AI update of 2025. Your AI assistant can now directly connect to and control your phone's native apps. No more copy-pasting between apps or manual data entry.

**What This Actually Means:**

Instead of Claude just giving you text responses, it can now:

* Directly add events to your calendar
* Send draft messages to your messaging apps
* Find locations and integrate with maps
* Create and manage task lists in your preferred app
* Access and organize your existing data across apps

You can do it for multiple things at once like this and it works perfectly  
Schedule a focus time block over the next work week that avoids conflicts with existing meetings. Show me some nearby coffee shops – and remind me to take my headphones!

This set a meeting on my calendar, set a reminder for me, and told me the best nearby coffee shops perfectly.  I just had to allow access to each of the apps the first time.  

# Top Use Cases That Will Change Your Workflow:

**1. Meeting Scheduling on Steroids**

* ""Check my calendar for next Tuesday and schedule a 30-minute call with John at any free slot after 2 PM""
* Claude checks availability, creates the event, and can even draft the invite message

**2. Intelligent Daily Planning**

* ""Look at my calendar for today and create a prioritized task list based on my meetings""
* ""Find a coffee shop near my 3 PM meeting location where I can work for an hour before""

**3. Context-Aware Communication**

* ""Draft a message to Mom about Sunday dinner, check my calendar for conflicts""
* ""Write a birthday message for Sarah and remind me to send it on her birthday""

**4. Travel Coordination**

* ""I have a dentist appointment at 2 PM on Main Street. Find parking nearby and add a reminder 30 minutes before with driving directions""

**5. Life Admin Automation**

* ""Every Friday, check my completed tasks for the week and draft a status update email""
* ""When I add a dinner reservation to my calendar, automatically add 'Book babysitter' to my task list""

# How to Set It Up:

1. Update to the latest Claude mobile app
2. Go to Settings > App Connections
3. Grant permissions for the apps you want to integrate
4. You'll see available app actions when you start typing relevant requests

# Pro Tips from Early Testing:

**Be Specific with Permissions:** Only connect apps you actively want Claude to access. Start with calendar and tasks, then expand.

**Use Natural Language:** ""Add coffee with Jamie next Thursday at 3 PM at that place downtown we went last time"" actually works

**Chain Commands:** ""Check my calendar for tomorrow, find gaps longer than an hour, and suggest times I could go to the gym""

**Set Up Recurring Patterns:** ""Every Monday morning, look at my week and identify the three most important tasks""

**Review Before Executing:** Claude shows you what it's about to do before making changes. Always review, especially for messages and calendar invites.

# Current Limitations to Know:

* Cannot delete existing entries (only add/modify)
* Limited to certain app types (calendar, messages, maps, tasks currently)
* Requires explicit permission for each app
* Cannot access app-specific features (like Instagram stories or Spotify playlists)
* Message sending requires final user confirmation
* No access to banking or payment apps (by design, for security)

# Privacy & Security Notes:

* All app connections are opt-in
* You can revoke access anytime
* Claude doesn't store your app data on their servers
* Each action requires confirmation before execution
* Audit log available for all actions taken

# Availability:

From what I can determine, this appears to be rolling out to mobile users first. I'd recommend checking your app for updates. The exact tier availability (free vs. paid) isn't clear from the announcement, but historically Claude has made major features available to all users with some limitations for free accounts.

This isn't just another AI feature. It's the difference between an AI that gives advice and one that actually helps you implement it. We're moving from ""Claude, what should I do?"" to ""Claude, please do it.""

The rest of the day had been a bit of a blur to me. I was exhausted after a sleepless night fueled by the Terran's ""coffee"". When Gothlir announced to the crew that most ship functions (except for life support thankfully) would have to be taken offline so he could run a full system diagnostic it mercifully gave me the opportunity to retreat to my cozy quarters and try and catch up on some sleep.

When the crew dispersed from the materials lab I had made a straight shot for my room, eager to rest my weary brain. Science and stimulants could only keep a Dossur going for so long after all! When I was finally back into the secluded safety of my room I climbed into my hammock and finally closed my eyes.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

When I finally woke up I wasn't sure how much time had passed. In the seclusion of space it was impossible to tell. But as expected the light in my room sprang to life as soon as I sat up, stretching my stiff limbs. I slowly crawled my way out of the hammock and into the shower.

After a few minutes below the warm water I was finally awake. After a quick dry off under the fur dryer mounted to my wall I made my way out into the hallway. I couldn't hear any noise coming from the common's room, signifying that either it was very late and everyone was asleep or it was very early and nobody else was up yet. I considered my options for a moment before deciding to head to the bridge and see if anyone was up there.

A short elevator ride later and I found myself at the central hub of the ship. As I walked through the automatic doors to the bridge I reached up and wiped my eyes, unsuccessfully fighting a yawn. To my satisfaction I found the bridge wasn't entirely unoccupied. Sitting in her typical seat I could just make out the figure of Captain Reynolds, little more than her gray hair and arms visible from my position behind her chair.

My eyes immediately focused on a small photograph in her hand. The captain, seemingly oblivious to my presence, seemed to be focused intently on the photo in her hand. I slowly inched my way closed to where she set, carefully avoiding making any noise as my curiosity grew. I slowly made my way towards the back of the chair, suddenly happy for my diminutive size in comparison to other races, enabling me to move silently enough to avoid her attention.

After a few moments of holding my breath I was close enough to see the photo in her hand. It featured four figures standing in front of what looked like some enormous mechanical wheel with the ocean and the setting sun filling up the background. I squinted as I struggled to make out the figures in the photo. I could see two adult Terrans, one on either side of the frame. On the left I could see a man with bright red hair that I quickly recognized as Officer Monahan. His hair had certainly grayed quite a bit since whenever this photo was taken but his grinning face was unmistakable. On the right side was a woman with short, black hair who looked equally happy. This one took a moment longer to dawn on me. It was Captain Reynolds! The worn worry wrinkles on her face and the complete lack of gray hair through me off for a second but it was unmistakably her! She had her arms linked with Monahan around another pair of figures in the center of the photo.

One of the two central figures was a much younger human with long, black hair pouring over his shoulders in an unkempt mane. He held a similar, tooth filled look of happiness as the two older figures, albeit his teeth appeared to have some sort of metal frames attached to them. It was…. An odd appearance to say the least. Next to him was a young Venlil pup with light gray wool that looked far too overgrown, almost to the point that it covered her face. Where the younger human had seemed quite happy in the photo the Venlil seemed much more subdued and shy, her face clearly blooming a noticeable shade of orange. I stared for a minute longer, unable to pick out who the two younger figures were.

Before I could think much longer on the subject the captain's seat swiveled about and Reynold's was face to face with me, her binocular eyes locking onto my small form from where she perched.

""Is there something you need Dr. Zotta?"" She asked, her face the ever calm, statuesque placidity that I had come to know. I let out a squeak of surprise as she suddenly announced that she was aware of my presence.

""I… I apologize ma'am."" I stammered out in shock, my tail bristling at the sudden movement, ""I didn't mean to spy. I just woke up and was wondering where everyone was!"" I quickly answered, melting a bit under her stern gaze.

""Well you did sleep for quiet a bit."" Reynolds replied, letting out a sigh as she took the photo in her hand and slid it quietly into the pocket of her synthetic hides. ""After Ensign Gothlir finished his system diagnostics I ordered a hiatus on any further analysis of the unusual data device. Once Gothlir cleared our systems of any potential hazardous code I decided we would head deeper into the system to investigate the inner two planets."" She explained, turning her swiveling chair back towards the viewport ahead of her. I silently took a moment to look out it myself. Even from here I could make out the random chunks of debris that seemed to fill the system.

""Since the ship's auto-pilot would refuse to enter such a material dense area of space we will have to fly in on manual in sub light."" She continued, not bothering to wait for any commentary, ""Thus it will take a few days for us to move from the edge of the system to there. In the meantime I told everyone to go ahead and get some rest. I'm well aware that half my crew was awake all night."" She finished, a soft hint of amusement tinting her speech, ""I need everyone in peak performance when we start to move in. The last thing we want is someone being sleepy and missing some piece of debris heading towards us on the sensor readout. I'll probably wake them up here in a couple of hours.""

I stood there silently for a moment, hesitating to ask what was on my mind. The Human seemed to pick up on it without me having to voice the thought however.

""Go head and ask whatever it is on your mind Dr. Zotta."" She insisted, her voice sounding defeated and melancholy through the translator, though I wasn't yet certain as to why.

""I…. I was just wondering ma'am…"" I began, trying my best to broach the subject in as gentle a manner as I could, ""What that photo you were looking at was?"" There was a moment of silence after that, the quiet so thick that it felt like one of the impenetrable fogs that fell over the lowland forests of Mileau.

""Come here."" Captain Reynolds spoke at last, visibly patting one of the arms of her chair. I tentatively made my way over, pausing at the base of her seat for a moment. ""Come on Dr. Zotta,"" She insisted. Leaning her head down to train those predatory eyes on me, ""I'd prefer to have you at eye level for this."" I gave a silent flick of my ears in confirmation before scampering up the side of her swiveling seat and onto the arm rest she had indicated.

""Can I trust this stays between the two of us?"" She asked, the deep wrinkles on her flat face looking more pronounced than ever. Her voice left no doubt that my discretion was an absolute requirement before I was going to learn whatever secret she was holding onto.

""Of course Captain."" I replied, starting to feel more and more nervous about whatever it was she had to tell me. Clearly it was something that was weighing on our stalwart captain. The difference between her normal, stoic expression and the weighted, trepidation filled look on her face now only served to make me more anxious in return.

""That's a picture from years ago,"" She began, her eyes drifting off towards the viewport but seemingly a thousand light years away, ""It was the first time I convinced Leo's mom to let him spend the summer with me on Earth. Of course he insisted that I bring Vakks with him. It was… one of my happier memories."" She explained, making me cock my head in confusion.

""Why did you bring Leo to stay with you on Earth?"" I asked uncertainly, squinting my eyes up at her. I wasn't very familiar with Terran family structure but it struck me as odd that anyone, regardless of species, would allow their child to spend a season with a total stranger.

""Because he's my nephew."" Captain Reynolds explained with a weary groan, ""We don't typically tell people on the crew that because he's worried they'll think I'm going to give him some sort of preferential treatment."" She explained, waving one dexterous hand dismissively, ""But it isn't like half of them don't already know that.""

""HE IS?!?!"" I squeaked out in surprise, completely taken aback by the revelation. In my head different things I had heard around the ship began to rattle around my brain, the pieces slowly clicking into place. Captain Reynolds just laughed at my shocked response.

""Well maybe we're doing a better of being discreet than I thought!"" The elder Terran laughed, a sad grin on her face, ""But seriously I'm certain that most of the crew know. We do about as well a job of hiding that as we do the fact that he and Vakks are together.""

I had to cock my head to the side once again, finding myself at a loss or what our ship's commander was talking about. ""What do you mean together?"" I pressed, staring up at the captain as she seemed to look me over uncertainly.

""You… didn't pick up on that yet?"" She quizzed back, cocking one of her eye ridges in that typical, human look of confusion.

""Pick up on what?"" I insisted, increasingly feeling foolish that I hadn't latched onto whatever she seemed to find so obvious.

""So Leo and Vakks are… shit… how do you former feds label it…. Mates?"" She suggested. The comment shocked me so much I nearly fell off of the armrest upon which I sat, reeling at the revelation.

""I had no idea!"" I squeaked back in shock, grabbing hold of her arm to steady myself, ""Why did nobody tell me?"" I whined, ""I feel like an idiot! I thought they were just really close friends!"" Even as I struggled to collect myself from that revelation I could tell that Captain Reynolds was fighting off laughter at my reaction.

""This may not be a military ship,"" She explained, ""But the SC still highly discourages crew on their joint venture ships from fraternizing. We've all just agreed not to mention it out loud and the brass just sort of looks the other way."" She admitted, her free hand coming over to gently brush over the top of my head. ""Don't feel too bad. It took Dr. Mok'lil a whole 2 months to realize it."" She added, clearly trying to make me feel better for my own social blindness. Still, thinking back on it this made a whole lot of things make so much more sense. I leaned myself over against the captain's arm.

""Well that was certainly a lot to process at once."" I gasped.

I sighed, looking over at the ball of gray fluff laying next to me. There wasn't a whole hell of a lot of room on these SC supplied beds but being forced to lay tight against Vakks certainly didn't bother me. The captain's suggestion for some rest before we continue into the system wouldn't be wasted on us.  We'd snuck off to my quarters to lay down and nap together. Still I hadn't been able to fall asleep, so I'd just laid there, watching the Skalgan next to me breathe. She looked so peaceful with her eyes closed, her face just inches from mine.

""What are you staring at?"" She asked without opening her eyes, those big ears flicking in amusement as I realized she was awake now.

""Nothing much."" I replied with a grin, ""Just thinking how I'm the luckiest guy in the galaxy."" The Skalgan chuckled slightly at that, those side facing eyes opening as she looked back at me with what I could only describe as the most loving glance imaginable.

""Hey Leo I've been thinking…"" She said after a moment of silence, ""Are you sure about this?"" I had to pause at that, my mind taking a moment to catch up to what she meant.

""Sure about what?"" I shot back, ""That I'm the luckiest guy in the galaxy? I mean I haven't won the Skalgan lottery yet or anything but I still feel pretty lucky."" I could see her try to mimic the typical Terran eye roll but it just looked downright goofy on her face and I was forced to stifle a chuckle.

""That's not what I meant and you know it."" She sighed, her long tail curling around to slap me playfully on the back. Sometimes it still got to me how close we were in height. I could still remember how small her parents seemed, even when I was only a young teenager. But the uncuring had gone a long way towards giving the Vinlil their size and strength back. Granted I knew I was a pretty runty human but still…

I reached a hand gently into the thick tuft of wool around her chest, grabbing for the bottom piece to that silver chain she had decided to wear around her neck. At last I felt the small, metal hoop buried in that fluffy abyss and pulled it out, revealing the gold band adorned with diamonds I had given her.

""This is what you meant right?"" I answered with a relenting sigh of my own, eyeing the piece of Terran jewelry that had once belonged to my mother. It had been one of the few things I had been able to save after Vakks and I returned from Earth. Even back then I don't know I f I could have ever imagined giving it to someone else.

""Yes."" She answered simply, her amber colored, horizontal eyes looking over to me with more uncertainty than I was used to seeing in them. Vakks was usually the confident one. Since we were kids she'd always been the one sticking up for me. Always been the one helping me stand up to the bullies. It was almost unnerving to see that usual confidence and bravado slip away. ""You know if we really do this that we're going to spend the rest of our lives being looked at as freaks right?""

""I don't know."" I mused hopefully, ""Remember governor Tarva and ambassador Noah?"" I suggested, doing my best to be hopeful, ""People thought they were freaks too but now nobody bats an eye at it.""

""That's because they're celebrities Leo."" She insisted with a gentle shake of her head, taking the small golden band into her own hand, ""Those kind of people get a pass. They live in a totally different world from us. Me and you? People are going to judge.""

I scowled at that, feeling a lump forming in my chest, ""Vakks…"" I stammered out, afraid to even ask the question, ""Did… did you change your mind?"" I managed to finish, only to feel that tail of hers slap into my back with a great deal more force than before.

""Of course not you idiot!"" She growled, as though the very suggestion was disgusting to her, ""But… I don't want to drag you down. I don't want you to be… unhappy."" She finished. I could see a look of vulnerability and indecision on her face that seemed totally alien to every memory of the strong Skalgan woman I had in my head. Without a word I buried my face in the tuft of wool atop her head.

""The only way I'd ever be unhappy is a life without you."" I quickly assured her, planting a kiss on top of her fluff, ""I love you Vakks. I don't care what anyone thinks or says about us. There's no other woman for me in the universe except you."" She seemed t finally cheer up at that, her ear and tail movements letting me know how happy she was. Even still she attempted to force out a version of the more human smile for my sake. I couldn't help but laugh. Even after all these years practicing it still looked so awkward on her face.

""Don't laugh!"" She hissed, giving me a playful shove, knowing full well what I was laughing at, ""I can't help it if your weird primate face gestures don't work on Skalgan faces!""

""I told Aunt Am by the way."" I threw out, making her pause, eyeing me curiously.

""And she said?""

""You know her."" I replied with a shrug, ""She gave me a real official sounding 'congratulations' and a hand shake.""

""Ah."" Vakks replied, looking away.

""What?"" I asked, noticing the momentary lull in her mood.

""I don't know."" She answered, turning her eyes back towards me, ""I just was hoping that maybe she would be more… excited?""

""I'm sure she is."" I assured her with a confident grin, ""She's never been the emotional type. Can't expect her to go bouncing around the room and showering us with hugs like your parents did.""

""Fair."" Vakks replied with a chuckle, ""I thought dad was going to start crying on me. He really loved your dad and I think he feels like us getting married is… I don't know…. Fate or something like that?""

""I know."" I said with a nod, feeling a tinge of nostalgia as I thought back on my parents for the first time in a while. After so long… I could barely remember their faces it felt like. ""Sometimes I think your dad misses them more than even I do.""

I looked up, feeling Vakk's rough paw pad pressed against my cheek, forcing me to look back into her eyes once more.

""You know they would be proud of you right?"" She asked, her voice coming off more as a command than a question.

""I do. Thanks babe."" I responded, leaning in and planting another kiss on her snout. As we lay there in blissful silence for a moment the door nearby opened and a single, floating maintenance drone hovered into the room.

""I didn't think those things were supposed to come into the rooms while they're occupied?"" Vakks said, sitting up and eyeing the machine curiously as it made a slow pass around the room. Strangely it didn't stop to blow dust off of my nearby desk nor to extend one of its jointed arms down to pick up the shirt I had taken off and tossed onto the chair before we laid down. Instead it simply kept moving, making a slow pass around the room until it got to the bed. Once its single, red lensed eye had reached us it simply paused, hovering there silently as it gazed at us.

""Ok…"" I noted, looking at the drone uncertainly, ""This is getting kinda creepy.""

""What the dayside is it doing?"" Vaaks chimed in, tilting her head to look at it, ""Do you think it's broken or something?""

""Goth did say he was running some automated system tests while everyone was sleeping. Maybe the drone routine functions are getting messed up because of that?"" I suggested, attempting to find some rational explanation for the automaton's behavior.

""Well it's creeping me out."" Vakks hissed, taking one powerful leg and slamming her rear paw directly into the drone's face. The floating device was sent spiraling into the far wall of the room, very nearly slamming into the small, private TV mounted there.

""Damn Vakks!"" I gasped, taken aback by the sudden violent outburst, ""Try not to break SC property too much!"" The Venlil just shrugged in reply as if her action was perfectly rational and justified.

""I'll bring it up to Gothlir when everybody goes up to the bridge."" I suggested. Before either of us could speak again the door opened once more as another drone hovered into the room.

""Ok what the fuck is going on?"" Vakks hissed, glaring at the drone like it was a venomous sunslip from back on Skalga. The drone made a quick turn to look at the previous one that now lay on the floor, completely inoperable before turning back towards us and resuming the first drone's creepy stare.

""He's fucking with us."" I laughed, suddenly realizing what was going on, ""That's gotta be what it is! He's fucking with us to get revenge for last year!""

""Revenge?"" Vakks repeated, slowly starting to come to the same conclusion based on the sound of her voice, ""You mean for that time you put all that liquor in his sleeping meds?""

""Don't make it sound like I was the only person involved!"" I shot back with a laugh, ""You overrode his whole room's AI controls and blasted that stupid song over his TV!""

""Yeah but you deciding to drug him was the reason he went nuts!""

""How was I supposed to know that mixing alcohol with that stuff would cause a reaction?"" I exclaimed, turning my gaze back towards the drone as it continued to stare at us, ""Hey Goth! I know you're seeing this! Joke's over! I already had to pay for the TV in your room after you threw a whole nightstand through it. Enough."" The drone didn't budge. It simply continued to hover there. Staring…

""That's it!"" Vakks spat, rolling over top of me to practically throw herself out of the bed and onto the floor. ""You wanna play games you creepy vouyer?!?!"" She growled, paws curling into fists as she pushed her way past the still staring drone and headed for the door. I hurriedly jumped out o bed myself, grabbing my shirt off the nearby chair and throwing it on before rushing out the door after her.

  
""Vakks don't start swinging just yet!"" I exclaimed, knowing all too well how her temper could get the better of her reasoning. Like most of the new generation of uncured Venlil, Vakks had a short fuse. Hell the average uncured Venlil made even the most hotheaded Terran look calm and reasonable by comparison!

I rushed down the hall as quick as I could but in short bursts my Skalgan fiancé was far faster than any human could be and by the time I reached her she was already slamming her fist on Gothlir's door.

""Open up you creep!"" She yelled, loud enough that everyone in the hallway was sure to wake up and hear it, ""What's wrong with you? Trying to spy on us? What were you hoping to see you freak!?!"" She shouted, continuing to hammer her fist into the Gojid's door.

""Awesome…"" I groaned as I made her way beside her, ""Cause I wanted everyone on the whole ship to hear what's going on…""

As if on cue the door next to Gothlir's opened and an exhausted looking Monahan stuck his head out.

""I sure hope someone is on fire cause I don't know why else you'd be out here screaming at the top of your lungs…"" Earl groaned, wiping the sleep out of his eyes as he looked over at us.

""Gothlir's being a fucking creep and sending drones into Leo's room to spy on us!"" Vakks hissed, her anger still going strong.

""And why were you in Leo's quarters?"" Earl shot back, a knowing smirk on his face. Instantly Vakks's face went from its usual slate gray to a deep shade of orange.

""That… that's not the point!"" She bleated back, her tail tucking in a bit from embarrassment. Before Earl could continue his fun Gothlir's door opened and the half awake Gojid looked up at us.

""What in the stars are you screaming about out here?"" He yawned, eyes half open. Vakks and I stood there for a moment, studying the Gojid's face, trying to determine if he was messing with us still.

""You… you were asleep?"" Vakks stammered out, looking between myself and the very confused Gojid.

""Well I was TRYING to be."" Gothlir grumbled, ""What are you all worked up about? ""

""We just had a pair of maintenance drones come in my room and just… stare at us.""

""Gonna ignore the obvious implications with that statement and just move on to the drone issue."" Gothlir sighed, walking back into his quarters and picking up his holopad from his nightstand. The old bristleback wiped at his eyes, trying to wake himself up before tapping a few things into his pad. ""According to the ship's logs there aren't even any active drones on this whole floor."" He yawned, walking back towards the hallway.

""Well there was just a minute ago."" Vakks insisted, pointing down the hall towards my quarters. Gothlir let out a sigh, looking over to Monahan who had made his way out into the hall to join us. The old soldier was wearing little more than a pair of boxers I knew but he at least had a bathrobe wrapped around him to hide it.

""I'll check."" He sighed, starting to walk down towards my quarters. I followed quickly behind him to let him in, the door opening as I approached. Sure enough the drone in question was still hovering inside, though now its gaze had turned towards the door. Monahan paused, looking down to the drone Vakks had kicked laying broken in the floor. ""Ok. Well there's definitely a couple of drones in here.""

""What the…?"" Gothlir grumbled, waddling his way down behind us and peering into the room, ""Why is that one not showing up on the ship's active drone registry?"" He mused, looking down at his holopad before walking over and flicking a small switch on the rear of the floating, metallic orb. Instantly the device fell to the floor and the Gojid grunted, using both hands to pick it up. ""Care to grab the other one Earl?"" He growled, heading back towards his room, ""I'll  run a diagnostic on them and see what's gotten into these things.""

 

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Captain Hult, Republic/UN Joint Operations

**Date:** \[Standardized Human Time\]: January 28, 2158

 

I stood at attention by the door, my rifle held at the ready. Although I couldn't tell if the Colonel knew I was watching him, my wide field of vision gave me a good look at the face my commander was making as he sat expectantly at his desk. One of utter distaste.

""Captain?"" Colonel Lin sighed, ""Go ahead and speak what's on your mind. I know you're staring at me."" I coughed sheepishly, a little embarrassed he had realized. The good colonel had certainly become quite accustomed to leading Venlil it seemed.

""I was just wondering Sir,"" replied, making sure to keep to the strict formality that Lin and the other Terran instructors had drilled into us over the last year, ""If this Jones woman is as bad as you say?"" The colonel turned his binocular eyes to face me directly.

""Yes captain."" He replied bluntly, ""She is as bad as I have said and worse."" I could practically feel the venom dripping from his voice. ""Humanity has spent the better part of 30 years trying to convince the rest of the galaxy that we're a civilized and honorable race. She is the absolute counter point to those arguments.""

""I can scarcely believe the UN would employ someone like that Sir."" I responded, finding it unthinkable that the government that I had come to look up to would employ an absolute shadstalker like the woman he was describing.

""She is an unpleasant necessity I'm afraid."" Colonel Lin growled, ""I for one find the all this spying and subterfuge most dishonorable."" I nodded my head in agreement. Especially knowing that, from what the colonel had said, that subterfuge wasn't just reserved for the UN's enemies. A sudden buzz from the colonel's holopad ended the conversation there though.

""She's here."" He muttered, sitting up straight in the bare looking wooden chair. A moment later the door to his office slid open as another human walked in. This one was clearly female from what I knew of the primate's physiology. Despite her obvious age her head fur hadn't grayed like most of her species and remained a soft blonde in color. She wore a grin across her face that seemed fake to my untrained eye, no more meaningful to determining her true emotions than those visors the government had once forced the human's to wear. The worst part was her eyes. As relatively at ease as I had become around humans those eyes sent a chill up my spine. Those were the eyes of an honest to goodness predator.

""Colonel!"" She greeted, hurrying her way over to the chair opposite him by the desk, ""How's your little project teaching the Venlil how to grow a spine?"" The comment made me fume but I held my composure.

""I find that the Venlil are every bit as determined and courageous as any human."" Lin fired back, keeping his voice calm despite the anger I knew that comment had festered in him. It was no secret that a lot of the UN's high command had viewed the idea of training Venlil as ground troops to be a waste of time. My species had a hard mold to break since everyone had always seen us as the galaxy's biggest pushovers. Colonel Lin had not seen it that way. When he had arrived on Skalga he had treated us the same as he would any human troops. Or, in his own words he had been even harder on us.

""I'm sure."" Jones laughed, shooting a sidelong glance at where I stood in the corner. ""Is there some reason this one is here?""

""That is Captain Hult."" Lin explained, the very model of discipline as he withheld the vitriol I knew he wanted to spill onto Jones at that moment, ""He is my head officer with the Venlil troops and my second in command. He will be acting as proxy for the Republic's own military in this briefing.""

""Fine."" Jones replied, waving her hand dismissively, ""The Venlil Republic has already been notified of everything anyways. Not like we can so much as wipe our own nose without making sure the little sheep people are notified of it."" Despite the belittlement I kept my cool, standing at attention in my little corner. I wouldn't give this bitch the pleasure of seeing me react. Colonel Lin had trained us better than that.

""Speaking of,"" Lin interjected, trying to steer the conversation towards something more productive, ""What is the current state of affairs involving this 'Directorate' issue?"" Jone's phony smile seemed to fade at that.

""We've jumped through hoops trying to keep this under wraps. Don't want to start a panic in the SC ranks. God knows the damned Yotul are almost certainly already aware. Snoopy little bastards have ears everywhere."" She growled, ""Only leaf munchers I can really respect. Not that they wouldn't have known even IF they hadn't been spying on us. Another probe from showed up near Leirn.""

Both the colonel and I noticeably stiffened up at that revelation.

""I'm sure you can imagine the reaction the Technocracy had when some unmanned vehicle showed up in their space and suddenly disabled a whole space station."" Jones added with a satisfied chuckle, ""Same modus operandi. Did a scan of the station then hacked into their systems and jacked a shit ton of data.""

""Have the Yotul's government made any comment?"" Lin pressed, furrowing his brow ridges in a look I'd come to recognize as concern.

""They reached out to the UN. Basically admitted they'd already been aware of this new player and agreed to keep things under wraps."" Jones sighed, crossing her legs and leaning back in the uncomfortable wooden chair she occupied, ""Nobody wants to be the first to let the public know there's some unknown group running around with the capacity to shut down military installations at a whim.""

""What does the UN plan to do about this?"" Lin continued, looking more concerned by the minute.

""Well we've already started scanning the region of space the probes are bolting off to. We can see that whoever this Directorate group is they have a sizable force mustering in a small star cluster a short shot outside SC space.""

""How big of a force?""

""Well scans at that range aren't exactly super accurate,"" Jones explained before answering, ""But best we can tell? At least a couple million ships.""

There was a long silence after that. That number of vessels, even assuming the vast majority were drones like the ones we had seen already, was completely unthinkable.

""Then they're planning an assault?"" Lin gasped finally, sitting back in his own chair with a look of disbelief.

""Not sure."" Jones said with a shrug, ""They have enough firepower gathered in that one system to steamroll the whole SC and it's doubtful that's even the full scale of their forces, but they haven't made a move. More than that though… they've sent a communication to UN high command.""

My ears perked up at that and, had he the ability to perk his ears up, I dare say Colonel Lin would have done the same.

""What sort of communication?"" Lin questioned, leaning forward now with intense interest, ""And how was the UN able to keep THAT a secret?""

""They want to meet."" Jones explained, ""They sent a set of coordinates for an uninhabited star system on the edge of UN space. As for how they kept it a secret? Well these Directorate assholes hijacked the whole communication network and sent the message directly to Secretary General Kuemper's office. For fuck's sake they left it as a voicemail on her personal holopad."" Every new detail that Jones gave only made the situation seem more and more dire. ""I'm putting this one in your lap by the way. Good chance to see how your little soldiers do under stress."" She added with a smile that felt more predatory than anything I'd ever seen from humanity up until that point. ""Also I want you to take along that little crew that made the first contact. Before you ask why I'll go ahead and explain. One: they can confirm if whoever you end up meeting there is the same group that they encountered before. More importantly however it means I can keep them under watch. Can't risk them running their mouths on social media or something.""

""I understand."" Lin said with a nod, still biting his oral appendage and holding back from saying what he felt, ""I will go ahead and give the order to get ready and ship out.""

""Good boy."" Jones laughed, that demeaning comment making my blood boil more than anything she had said so far. I was thoroughly convinced at this point that all the negative things the colonel had said about this sadistic sociopath were true.

At last Jones stood up, looking directly at me with that same, revolting smirk on her flat face.

""Good luck soldier."" She told me, leaning uncomfortably close to me, ""I hope that you don't disappoint. Despite what the good colonel over here might think I really am rooting for you. It would be nice to have another species in the SC that wasn't a complete dead weight on us."" Finally, as I felt my patience stretching to its very limit, she excused herself and walked out of Lin's office.

""Cunt."" The colonel muttered under his breath. The image the translator pulled for that particular phrase making my ears bloom orange. I wasn't sure why he had thought that sort of thing about that vile creature but I was hoping that it was some cultural context the translator had failed to pick up on. Lin turned towards me, studying me as he often did. I could tell that he was about to give me another test of my tactical thinking.

""What do you make of that information captain?"" He asked, ""A fleet that could absolutely overrun the SC and the offer to meet?""

""Intimidation tactics Sir."" I replied quickly, not missing a beat, ""These Directorate people clearly have the technological know-how to hide their forces if they want to. They don't. They're purposely parking their fleet on our doorstep to let us know they COULD be a threat if they want to. Secondly I would add that their probe to Leirn was a tactical decision as well.""

""Oh?"" Lin replied, barely hiding the approval I could tell he felt, ""And why would that be?""

""These people took a hefty amount of data from that scout ship pertaining to SC member races."" I explained, ""After the UN the next biggest threat to any potential hostile action they may take against us is the Technocracy. The probe was meant as an evaluation of their systems and to gauge how much of a threat they might pose.""

""Astute as always captain."" The colonel remarked with a satisfied nod, ""These are not the actions of a party wanting a peaceful first contact. These are the hallmarks of an aggressor. They're probing our systems. Gauging how much of a threat we are to them. I would almost guarantee that the information they stole from the Yotul was mostly militant in nature. Enemy ship numbers and their capabilities. That sort of thing. And as much as the Yotul like to dig into everyone else's business I dread to think what sort of information they were able to get their hands on.""",7,1757813523.0,NatureofPredators,0,1.0,False

Surprise battle was loso vs Pass. Loso 30. Pass sounded uninspired and had a whack ass angle about loso being gay that he stretched for two rounds.


Official was on her way to a 30 even before she knocked coffee's titties loose. Im glad TBL handled it the way they did and didnt have to shut the event down.


Ars 2-1. Jaz was dope but ars was RAPPING. He messed up a little bit I believe in his 3rd. Jaz was surprisingly underwhelming. Great performance from ars though. 


Rex 2-1. He got the 1st and 2nd. Ave was dope but Rex was way more entertaining. Rex came out with a banger ""Nigga i wanted to kill geechi so bad I almost killed myself"" 🔥🔥


Swamp 2-1 maybe 30. Hollow just continues to be disappointing. If this is really swamps last battle he's going out on a high note.


Nitty 2-1. 1st and 3rd. I might've gave him the 2nd too but someone passed out and it messed the round up a little bit. This battle was amazing. Definitely BOTN so far. Definitely a BOTY contender. Cal was amazing. Nitty was amazing. Nitty just was rapping longer and bombing. He had this shit in his 3rd ""NO FACE NO CASE ITS A BURNT CD 👽🔥"" I cant wait to watch this again.

1ngef7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1ngef7h/i_was_debt_free_but_i_got_myself_back_into_debt/,I was debt free but I got myself back into debt again,"I was debt free in January. Paid around 10k off of my credit cards. I did this using back pay from disability when I got accepted. They gave me 12k. I ended up spending a bit more on my cards and had to use the last 2k... I didn't change my habits. Unfortunately. I'm back at 10k. This time I'm going to have to really work for it. Actually take the time and pay it off with discipline. I'm going to try and save at the same time. 
I'm aiming for around $500 per month put towards my credit cards. The minimums (2 cards) are around $100 each. I'm just going to be saving very small amounts. Microsaving. Debt is my number one priority right now but I only have 88 cents in savings so I need something there too. 

My first step is to stop buying iced coffees and treats for my daughter every single time I'm out. (Should save me 100-280). This money will be going to savings. 

My second step is to stop paying for the bus via credit card and instead get a bus pass. With a bus pass it's around $135 without one, it's over $280. (Saving 145). These savings will go to credit. 

My third step (really this one should probably be first) is treating my OCD because my main compulsion is very expensive. Idk how much I spend on this one but let's say it's like $100 per week. So $400 a month. These savings will also go to credit. 

My fourth step is trying to remember to actually pay my phone, internet, etc... that are automatically paid for via credit. It's just adding up and I'm not moving the money over to cover it. I don't want to remove the automatic payments because I have ADHD and I don't want to ruin my credit with missed payments. 

I'm going to shop my pantry and try to spend less on groceries. Avoid buying new clothes for me and my daughter if I can. Learn to be bored.

1ngef4r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngef4r,AIO for thinking my mom is emotionally abusing me here?,"  So my (27F) Mom (55F) was emotionally and verbally abusive throughout my childhood. Things like making fun of me and treating me bad for being overweight, mocking me when I cried, constantly comparing our looks and finding ways to put me down for my appearance, things of that nature. I’ve done my best to move past it and forgive her because you only get one mom and I don’t have any other friends or family I can go to for support. I only have my husband, my mom and my sister. That’s it. She has gotten better over the years with comments she makes to me and passive aggressive things she does especially once I had a daughter of my own. I’m expecting another little girl here in 10 days or less, I’m 38 weeks pregnant.


  Things have been stressful between my husband and I lately. I had actually made a post yesterday or the day before about an argument him and I had over coffee. We have been trying to communicate and figure out ways to ease the tension and one of them was that we would take some space away from each other once a week whether that be me staying elsewhere for a night or him. 


  I texted my mom asking if I could stay for a night and she said yes but being 38 weeks pregnant, my willingness to get out and do things is subject to change anytime. Today though I cancelled because I live in Florida and it’s constantly raining but today was nice so I wanted me, my husband and our daughter to go swimming. I couldn’t do this anyways though breakfast made me nauseous. 


  Anyways, mom has a bad habit of guilt tripping when I do something that disappoints her so to prevent conflict I asked if I could let her know in the morning and what I meant by that is let her know whether I’d still be coming or not. I thought It was clear but I’m thinking now maybe it wasn’t. She has either been ignoring me or being short with me all day, she didn’t even tell me she loved me back when I told her I loved her which is something she has done before when she’s been disappointed. I feel like even if I wasn’t totally clear with her that I don’t deserve treatment like this. 


  I’m definitely overly sensitive at this point in my life, a lot of it is hormones and some personal stressors but this has really upset me a lot and I feel like this is borderline emotional abuse. AIO for thinking this? I want opinions on it and also some advice on how to move forward and what I should say to her next would be appreciated because I don’t know how to even respond at this point.

I’ve heard of comphet and read into it and honestly it didn’t help. I’ve always been confused about my sexuality and just identify as Bi because it’s easy to identify that way. But the more I start paying attention to the people around me the more I start to realize i don’t know if I’m into men. I’ve primarily dated men but not because I was interested in them first. It’s always been that someone develops feelings for me, pursues me, and I already had an emotional connection with them because usually they were a friend of mine or I knew them by association and then ended up friends and then more. I even think I’ve been in love before but sex always became an issue. I never really enjoyed it sexually. It’d feel good and then I’d want it to be over. My mind would wander. I didn’t like feeling lusted over by them. And I’d have to play along and think about the right way to act when it came to our sex life. In any relationship I’ve had with a man. It even got to a point I couldn’t have sex sober. I’d always get drunk or high first. I’ve never had crushes on men. Not even as a kid. Not even celebrities. But I have women. I get crushes on women. I think about them. About kissing them and holding them. But I’ve had boyfriends and I’ve cared about them, and been hurt by them. And even got cheated on and it broke my heart. But I’d always think about girls in every single one. That’s why I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Why am I this way? Am I repulsed by men sexually because of the sexual trauma in my past ( I’ve been raped ) or am I just gay? I’m talking to someone right now and he’s amazing. I love him a lot because he was my friend for multiple years. But I keep trying to break things off because I need to think. It feels like I’m leading someone on and I don’t want to hurt him. But each time I do he gets visibly hurt and shows up with flowers or coffee or to talk. And it breaks my heart. I don’t know what to do ",3,1757813257.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Plus this is my first time actually dating a guy so I feel a little like I'm in the deep end over here.

I was thinking of doing a hiking date together. My idea was to pick him up and then we'd drive about an hour to a nearby mountain and do a hike together. The hike is about 5 miles long but easy, and I know he likes hiking as much as me. I'd pack lunch and drinks and we'd just spend the day out there. But I'm not sure if the hour drive is a bit too long to be in the car with someone else like that? Also does it have the potential to get awkward? We were friends before we started dating so its not like he's a random person, but I am a little stressed.

The whole microbrew craze was barely starting and I wanted to be a part of it both as a way to make cheaper beer myself, but mostly to create my own recipes to share with friends and family. 

Like the good little perfectionist I am, I got started on my research. Books from the library, internet blogs and rare youtube videos on the subject. I read everything I could get my hands on and after litteral months of research, I finaly settled on a few pieces of equipment that should let me brew a decent beer. 

And then the doubts started settling in. I got my equipment and set it aside to do a little more research. Did I get the right stuff? Would that be good enough to get what I wanted to do?

I was scared of not being clean enough. A big part of brewing beer is making sure things are clean and sanitised. Did I get the right cleaning products? Most people use what I got but some dude online swears by another pink stuff that apparently works better, I'd better look into that. 

Time flew by. I was still waiting, perfecting my recipes, even though I had never even brewed once yet. I wanted my first time to go perfectly. After all, I know how I am, if the first cook is a failure, I might end up never using my kit again!

About a year passed by after buying my kit and I still hadn't fired up the thing. I still needed some reasurance. Just to be safe, I asked around and found one of my friend that had an old roommate that brewed his own beer. 

PERFECT! Put me in contact, I'll ask him some questions and see if he can help me understand how to do it.

I call the guy and he tells me he's planning on brewing that very weekend. So I go to his house to meet him. 

I get there with my notepad, and a list of questions. What temperature do you use? I hear higher temp gets you a better grain yield. Do you use a bag or just filter after boiling? Oh and how do you sanitise your equipments between steps? 

And that's when I looked up. This guy was mixing his brew, a big ol' smile on his face, having the time of his life.... with his pet rat resting on his shoulder!!!

At  that very second, something just clicked in my brain. My notes, my research, blogs, books, videos. None of this matters if I don't ever do it. All this time wasted worrying about doing the best, when I could have been on my tenth brew by now, getting better and better by trial and error instead. 

While I had been worrying about cleaning equipment, this guy had been brewing this whole time in the worse conditions imaginable. The worst part was, he's the only one of us who could claim that he had homebrew beer (it tasted like the bottom of an ashtray filled with coffee grounds btw). 

So I thanked him for his time and left. I did my first batch as soon as I could after that. It was far from perfect, but it was drinkable, and a good starting point to build up on. 

Now, whenever I start spirraling and over preparing for something, I think about that rat taunting me and remember that although some preparation might be required, nothing beats the experience of just starting something new and learning as you go. ",2,1757812512.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

I quite literally missed a class (my weakest one) because I was overworked and in a half-conscious, dream like trance while studying and I blinked and 1 hour was over. Did not have the energy to stand up, or anything. 

I hate the culture, I hate networking, I hate socializing, i hate coffee chats, I hate business in general, I hate large corporations. The only reason why I went for business was because of money and I “liked” marketing, my asian mom and my school’s business courses were pretty easy. I’m an introvert and quite literally diagnosed autistic.

The mental health cost of BBA on my already awful mental state is not worth it. First week here and I’m already considering transferring into education (eventual psych minor), which was my original plan. 

Like I’m thinking. Why the hell did I work myself to death in highschool trying to get a high grade if I was going to hate it in this “competitive” major anyways. If I went for education at the start, I would’ve gone for con-ed somewhere else. 

From what I see, the culture in education is much more appealing, the people seem better matched to me. I’ve worked with kids many times before, and it was all decently enjoyable, and felt very meaningful and aligned with me personally.

The only enjoyable elective I have is communication in a Canadian context, and I’m very intuitive regarding sociology & psychology in general. Even psychology isn’t very enjoyable to me anymore. It’s just so much memorization. 

there’s nothing I enjoy in my mandatory business course: microecon? Simple, useful, but boring as hell. BU111? Simple, pretty understandable but again… feels like a chore. BU127? This is the class I missed. Every chapter feels like reading ancient script. MA129? Calculus is literally a foreign language to me. I crammed in my HS finals, forgot it within days of completing the exam.

I know this is the consequences of my own actions but my mom quite literally threatened to disown me if I didn’t go for BBA, and she has my college savings. God. Please. She’s been somewhat more lenient since she found out I blacked out from overworking myself. So I’m hoping that I’ll be able to transfer to education next year. ",15,1757812430.0,wlu,12,0.89,False

Once you see these patterns, you can't unsee them.

**1. People say yes to those they like.** Seems obvious, but watch how salespeople mirror your body language, find common ground, or give genuine compliments before asking for anything. Works every single time.

**2. We feel obligated to return favors.** Someone gives you something small and free? You suddenly feel like you owe them. This is why car dealerships offer free coffee and real estate agents bring cookies to open houses.

**3. Social proof runs everything.** ""Most popular item,"" ""4.8 stars,"" ""other customers also bought"" - we look to others to decide what's normal or right. Even fake reviews work because our brains default to following the crowd.

**4. Authority makes us compliance machines.** Put someone in a uniform, give them a title, or mention their credentials and people will follow almost any instruction. It's scary how much we shut off critical thinking around perceived experts.

**5. Scarcity creates instant desire.** ""Limited time offer,"" ""only 3 left in stock,"" ""exclusive access"" suddenly you want something you didn't care about 5 minutes ago. Our brains are wired to want what we might lose.

**6. Commitment and consistency trap us.** Once you agree to something small, you'll do almost anything to stay consistent with that identity. This is how cults work, but also how gym memberships and political campaigns get you hooked.

**7. Reciprocation works even when you don't want the initial favor.** Someone does something ""nice"" for you that you never asked for? You still feel obligated to return it. Manipulative people exploit this constantly.

Once I learned this stuff, I started noticing it everywhere. Marketing emails, political ads, even friends and family use these tactics (probably without realizing it).

You become basically immune to most manipulation once you recognize the patterns. Haven't fallen for a sales pitch in months.

1nge179,https://www.statepulse.me/,"I created StatePulse — a free, open source platform to track bills and what your reps are actually doing (50 states + Congress)","Disclaimer: I know this might break a rule, but given the current environment of polarization and mis/disinformation, I feel like it's important for everyone to be informed of stuff that's actually happening. Also, who doesn't like FOSS (free & open source software)?

* Website: [https://www.statepulse.me/](https://www.statepulse.me/)

I spent the last three months creating StatePulse as a side/summer project! StatePulse updates every day and fetches the latest legislation across different jurisdictions. Uses Gemini's API to summarize bills in 100 words, with official source documents attached. Organizes information quickly and intuitively, allowing you to learn what bills your reps are passing (for all fifty states + Congress), and even what your reps voted for (Congress).

If you make a free account, you can enter as many topics/reps you want to subscribe to as possible (i.e. redistricting) and StatePulse will send updates at 9:00 AM PST on bills introduced with that description if they come up.

You can also search for your representatives and view cool visualizations with the interactive dashboard.

StatePulse's purpose is to serve as a place for organized, easily accessible content. The summaries generated by Gemini come directly from the bill text whenever possible, then the human written abstracts.

Everyone should have access to what's actually being passed in legislative chambers, especially considering how polarized the environment has become. As an incoming college freshman majoring in Computer Science, I think technology is a great aid in helping regular folks like me be more civically engaged.

I said I'd do that with my friends if I couldn't make an important life event (birthday/bachelorette) etc and he just said I don't have social skills which is why I think that it's fine.  
I stopped the convo since I didn't want to get into an argument but honestly it left me a little heated how patronizing he sounded lol. AIO?

Today I’m out in the garden, tackling weeds and planning for an herb garden, and thought - why not invite some company? If you’re up for a text chat or want to swap voice notes, I’d love to meet someone curious, thoughtful, a little flirty, witty and grounded enough to hold a conversation. 

Tell me a bit about yourself — age, location, what your weekend looks like, or your latest hyperfocus. If you’d like, share a voice clip or a photo so I know who I’m chatting with. Let’s see if we can have an interesting conversation to while away the hours.

Also currently waiting for a table for 1 at the Cheesecake Factory. My life can get a bit hectic with my job, and I sometimes suck at texting during the week. But I'm off work for a week and have some time to get to know someone.

Born and raised throughout the South and have lived all over, both domestically and internationally. Currently living in DC, at least through the end of the year until I get told where I'm going to next. 

I love Jesus, America, my dog, coffee, being active, history, reading, crafting, going to the movies, and road trips (non-work related ones). My faith and my career are a large part of my life. I love sports and cheered during college. I've had an adventurous life and am just missing someone to share it with... Especially if I get sent back to Europe. 

Physically, I'm your typical basic white girl. Blonde, blue eyed, kinda short, semi athletic. 

I'm looking for someone who also enjoys being active and healthy (or can at least do a 5k or hike with me), wants a family, slightly crazy like me, can tolerate country music, and wants to spend their retirement in Tennessee. 

Location doesn't matter to me, as long as you're in the US and ok with relocating to me, as I don't have the freedom to just move wherever. PM me if interested!",0,1757811570.0,r4r,1,0.5,False
