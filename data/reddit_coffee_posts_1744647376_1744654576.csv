Going to be staying around Central Park. I would love your recommendations on where to find the best bagels in Manhattan. I checked the last post here that said Absolute Bagels, but that seems to be permanently closed. 

If you have any other recs of good street food - where to find the best hotdog, falafel, coffee, etc. - absolutely local things, I would really appreciate it! Thanks a heap!",1,1744654457.0,FoodNYC,0,1.0,False

1jz5ppv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jz5ppv,Montecito Minimalist Mondays recap! Privacy Tour drop (Inspired by the most public pursuit of privacy in modern history) and after an IG poll I’m  working on a Recollections May Vary collection! (See last slide) Also some additional info below for Sinners in and around the EU!,"The Privacy Tour collection launched last week and the coffee cup was the bestseller! 

After a 100% yes vote on my Instagram account (see last slide) I’ve decided to work on a “Recollections May Vary” line, honoring foggy memories and flexible truths—coming soon to a timeline near you. Any suggestions or requests please place them in the comments below! 

And for our chic friends in and around the EU: the Privacy Tour Tote and both Aprons (flower sprinkles and “Oy vey Crudite”) are now printed in Germany—less VAT, more vicarious drama. I’m going to see if I can find a tee printer as well! 

Recollections May Vary will drop on this week’s “Title Free Thursdays” email! (So sign up if you haven’t on montecitominimalist.com) 

Always feel free to DM me here or email me at montecitominimalist@gmail.com 

Have a great week sinners!!

Hello! As the title says, looking for someone that can talk literally the whole night with. Can literally be about anything or if you need an ear to vent about something or just wanting a friend I’m here! 

A bit about me is, I teach, I gym almost everyday, and I like to cook! I love listening to Jazz music and I really enjoy a nice coffee conversation with music in the background. I listen to everything and I will take any options you’re willing to share and I’ll listen! 

If you’re interested shoot me a DM! Tell me your age and a bit about yourself! Don’t worry I don’t bite! Haha, can’t wait to hear from you! ",1,1744654170.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

The stove kept popping off the tank, everything together weighed a ton, and sand kept flying into my eyes and all over the setup. As the tide crept up, waves started reaching the stove and even soaked Adam Savage’s bedroll.

Oh—and when I was tamping, the coffee kept sticking to the tamper base and messing up the tamp (pretty sure it was the humidity). And because the bedroll was soaked and full of sand, it added like 10 extra pounds on the way back. Then came the one-hour trek home to clean all the salt off my gear. I left the bedroll dirty… that’s tomorrow’s problem.

And the sunset? Completely hidden behind thick clouds—not even a sliver of sun. Classic.

Even with all that, it was an awesome, fun experience—and one I’d totally do again. Next time, I’ll prep better… and bring stronger help!

The good, the bad, the ugly, the ups, the downs, and even the dark stuff inside that we all have but not everyone confesses. I appreciate witty banter, deep conversations, silliness, good humor, intellectual stimulation, and mutual vulnerability (which I understand takes time and trust). I'm respectful and I'm not here for sexting. I wouldn't speak to you in any way that might embarrass or offend our mothers, if you know what I mean. I'm a divorced man (married for 16 years, ended three years ago), I work two jobs, I take care of my elderly and ill mother, and I love things like books and rain and coffee and cats and being a homebody. I have a BA in history and will possibly be going back to school in the fall to pursue a psychology degree. I'm an old school hipster (in the 1940s sense of the word, not the 2010s sense), quite introverted and hermitic, artsy, brooding at times, tatted, well-read, personable and laid back and down to earth, and just really dealing with some bad loneliness in life right now. I don't care where you're from, how old you are, what you look like, or how much you weigh, so long as you do identify as female, can hold a good conversation, aren't selfie shy (because I'm not; it makes things more personal, and we know from *You've Got Mail* that whatever anything is it ought to begin by being personal).

1jz5j87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jz5j87/how_to_deal_with_my_friendship_first_love/,How to deal with my friendship first love?,"Hi everyone, I haven't made a post like this before so hopefully I do it right.

I'm from a pretty small town, less than 20,000 people live here. On top of that the elementary school that I went to was very small and was a ""feeder"" school for one of our towns high schools. That being said, when I started to date my now EX (20 M) in high school, I knew him and essentially grew up with him since elementary school and had a huge crush on him since I was around 12 years old.

I had one other boyfriend before him who I dated for a short period of time (maybe like 6 months) but myself and my now EX dated for close to 3 years. We ended up breaking up before graduating high school as we were both going to university. I initially wanted to do long distance (because I truly loved him so much) but, the topic brought up a lot of disagreements for us and we had a very dramatic break up.

It is important for me to note that we had what I consider to be a very beautiful and healthy relationship, I have never felt that connected to anybody before and for the most part we are extremely compatible people. He is also (I know that everyone says this) very different from any men I have ever known, in the best way possible.

After high school, he moved to the city to start school and I decided to move abroad and travel for the year. During this period we did not speak, the break up was very difficult for me but I do think that no-contact and moving abroad helped me to heal a significant amount.

After travelling, I ended up moving to the same city that he did to attend a different university (they are only about 30mins apart though). I didn't know if he was aware of this because we were still in no contact and after noticing that he listened to some of my playlists online, I got the confidence to reach out to him and ask to meet up for a coffee.

Seeing each other again was really incredible, after coming home the first night we met my roommate told me that she has ""never seen anybody look so happy before"" and that I was ''glowing"". So, we started meeting up once a month to grab coffee and catch up, we even exchanged books with each other like we have in the past. When we were both in our hometown for Christmas break he invited me to his new year’s party and overall the friendship was really positive for me.

Until it wasn't. I began to realize that I was possibly catching feelings for him again and it made me freak out so, I took some space away from the friendship and we didn't speak for a few months. About two weeks ago, I felt ready to reach out again and we met up for coffee. It was genuinely really nice but in the way that is a little painful. That same week, I ran into him (which has never happened before because we live in a very large city) and he was with some of his friends + a girl that he seems to be dating casually/hooking up with.

This definitely hurt me because although I know he owes me nothing and it has been about two years since our break up I was really shocked that he was dating someone. I guess I assumed that he wouldn't be seeing anyone even semi-seriously if he was still close friends with me because of the nature of our friendship. I now realize that I may have been reading too deep into our friendship and that he probably does not feel like it is as significant as I do (I thought us trading books was romantic LOL).

It is also important for me to note that I have always had a slight hope that we would get back together (in the very far future, like 5-10 years) which is probably a big sign that I am not as healed from this relationship as he is or that I thought I was.

I guess my question for you all is, how do you think I should navigate this? I truly appreciate him so much and don't want to cut him out of my life completely but I feel confused by our friendship. I sometimes hope that he still has similar feelings for me.....

Are there any guys that could explain his motivations for keeping a friendship with me, a lot of my friends say that it is odd to be friends with your EX, especially your first love.

I would also appreciate any advice from people who have been in a similar situation to me as most of my friends have not and I feel like they may not fully understand how I'm feeling.

Any advice/opinions are appreciated, thank you all !!!!",1,1744653933.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Lets assume you already know how to read/write and even speak abit but if some speaks to you in french there is 99% chance your brain wont even pick up cause its uncommon to you

what would you do?

1.Doing sessions where you close your eyes and put headphones and just listen 1min over and over till you write everything said?  
2.brute forcing through a video with no subtitles just trying to piece together and after 30 of those videos slowly improve?  
3.Would you start with really basic and slow stuff like peppa pig or coffee break french?  
4. watch something and shadow the words after the podcaster?(Sub titles on ofcourse)  
5. just watch a ton of content with subtitles before you move to no sub titles?

I can never get my idea on whats better so many conversations on it in the internet and theories like stephen krashen etc

We are fast food. 

We are fast food masquerading as 'high end' it's only 'high end' because it's expensive. Its not actually better. It's not healthy, the quality keeps going down, there's no consistency in quality control, and most of us have drive thrus! Have you ever seen a fancy coffee shop with a drive thru? The nicest coffee shop I know imports everything from France, bakes everything themselves, and still hand tamps their espresso.

 Shit, our refreshers don't even contain the juices they're supposed to! It's all white grapefruit juice! Giving a strict dress code doesn't at all fix ANY of the actual issues we actually have on the daily. Nor does it help the customers in ANY way. The best coffee shops I've ever been to had 10x more personality, and the baristas actually LIKED their jobs! I would much quicker trust a tatted pierced barista in quirky clothes than someone dressed 'business casual'. I would much rather see change in our product quality. Coming from someone who worked here when we could only wear black and still chooses to wear all or mostly black daily, even with a lax dress code. My store was literally gutted of its personality and made 'drive thru friendly' just so we'd be more efficient. We had comfortable reading chairs, we had a coffee farm mural on our wall, and a chalkboard we used to put beautiful hand drawn messages and pictures on. We had blue wall tiles behind the bar and black accents. Stained wood in front of our POS. We used to have people that came in every single day and spent their entire work day in our store. We could play (work appropriate) whatever music we wished, and it was easier to hold partners to the standards the company had set for us. 

This is a fucking joke. I used to absolutely love my job. I recommended it to anyone who was looking, and I went out of my way to work more; I even did my homework at my store. Now it literally feels like a joke. I don't even have opportunities to share coffee master knowledge with anyone anymore. That was my favorite part. I love coffee. I love coffee culture, REAL coffee culture, not whatever rushed ass fast food bullcrap this is. Wtf is making our dresscode stricter going to do besides make more baristas quit and even less people apply? People quit/back out over NAILS, do they really think it won't happen over body art, piercings, hair color, and whatever else they try and force on us?

I'm from a pretty small town, less than 20,000 people live here. On top of that the elementary school that I went to was very small and was a ""feeder"" school for one of our towns high schools. That being said, when I started to date my now EX (20 M) in high school, I knew him and essentially grew up with him since elementary school and had a huge crush on him since I was around 12 years old.

I had one other boyfriend before him who I dated for a short period of time (maybe like 6 months) but myself and my now EX dated for close to 3 years. We ended up breaking up before graduating high school as we were both going to university. I initially wanted to do long distance (because I truly loved him so much) but, the topic brought up a lot of disagreements for us and we had a very dramatic break up.

It is important for me to note that we had what I consider to be a very beautiful and healthy relationship, I have never felt that connected to anybody before and for the most part we are extremely compatible people. He is also (I know that everyone says this) very different from any men I have ever known, in the best way possible.

After high school, he moved to the city to start school and I decided to move abroad and travel for the year. During this period we did not speak, the break up was very difficult for me but I do think that no-contact and moving abroad helped me to heal a significant amount.

After travelling, I ended up moving to the same city that he did to attend a different university (they are only about 30mins apart though). I didn't know if he was aware of this because we were still in no contact and after noticing that he listened to some of my playlists online, I got the confidence to reach out to him and ask to meet up for a coffee.

Seeing each other again was really incredible, after coming home the first night we met my roommate told me that she has ""never seen anybody look so happy before"" and that I was ''glowing"". So, we started meeting up once a month to grab coffee and catch up, we even exchanged books with each other like we have in the past. When we were both in our hometown for Christmas break he invited me to his new year’s party and overall the friendship was really positive for me.

Until it wasn't. I began to realize that I was possibly catching feelings for him again and it made me freak out so, I took some space away from the friendship and we didn't speak for a few months. About two weeks ago, I felt ready to reach out again and we met up for coffee. It was genuinely really nice but in the way that is a little painful. That same week, I ran into him (which has never happened before because we live in a very large city) and he was with some of his friends + a girl that he seems to be dating casually/hooking up with. 

This definitely hurt me because although I know he owes me nothing and it has been about two years since our break up I was really shocked that he was dating someone. I guess I assumed that he wouldn't be seeing anyone even semi-seriously if he was still close friends with me because of the nature of our friendship. I now realize that I may have been reading too deep into our friendship and that he probably does not feel like it is as significant as I do (I thought us trading books was romantic LOL).

It is also important for me to note that I have always had a slight hope that we would get back together (in the very far future, like 5-10 years) which is probably a big sign that I am not as healed from this relationship as he is or that I thought I was.

I guess my question for you all is, how do you think I should navigate this? I truly appreciate him so much and don't want to cut him out of my life completely but I feel confused by our friendship. I sometimes hope that he still has similar feelings for me.....

Are there any guys that could explain his motivations for keeping a friendship with me, a lot of my friends say that it is odd to be friends with your EX, especially your first love.

I would also appreciate any advice from people who have been in a similar situation to me as most of my friends have not and I feel like they may not fully understand how I'm feeling.

Any advice/opinions are appreciated, thank you all !!!!",2,1744653480.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

So I called her and we really hit it off.  Talked for hours, and at the end she again suggested we meet. I know why but I said yes, I will call you about that rather than just setting it up then

  
I called her a few days later and asked to meet, and she said she had surgery in a couple days and will be laid up for a while after that.  (why did SHE suggest meeting in the first place if this as the case?

Seemed a different tone than all the communication before where she seemed so enthusiastic and eager even to get to know me.

The day before her surgery I texted her best wishes for it, she texted back a short thank you . A few days later I texted her again asking how it went, she said well, still on pain meds

Then a couple days later texted her saying I know she cannot meet in person now due to recovering from her surgery, but I would like to call her and could she suggest a time that is convenient.  Radio silence I Kind of wish if she just lost interest she would tell me that

I feel it has gone from her making all the initiatives and being enthusiastic to me doing that. How can she change so fast?  My plan of course is to not text her anymore, let her make the next move if she makes one at all.  

A friend suggested she probably got tired of her being enthusiastic and me being reticent, and just moved on, but now I have made clear to her I am very interested.  I dont get it

# Best Water Filter for Hard Water in 2025: Reviews, Ratings & Comparisons

Are you tired of dealing with the frustrating effects of hard water? Scale buildup around your faucets, dry and itchy skin, dull hair, and appliances that seem to be constantly breaking down are all signs of hard water problems. luckily, you're not alone, and high quality water filter for hard water can be the answer! In this extensive guide, we'll explore the best water filter for hard water options available in 2025, providing reviews, ratings, comparisons, and actionable insights to help you choose the ideal solution for your home or business. Whether you're a homeowner, small business owner, or plumbing professional, this article will equip you with the knowledge you need to combat hard water effectively.

## Understanding Hard Water and Its Impact

Before diving into the specifics of water filter for hard water solutions, it's essential to understand what causes hard water and how it affects your life.Water hardness level is resolute by the concentration of dissolved minerals, primarily calcium and magnesium. These minerals are picked up as water travels thru soil and rock. While these minerals aren't inherently harmful to drink, their presence leads to a multitude of problems.

   **Scale Buildup:** one of the most noticeable effects of hard water is the formation of scale, a chalky white deposit that accumulates on faucets, showerheads, pipes, and appliances like water heaters and coffee makers. This scale buildup can reduce water flow,decrease the efficiency of appliances,and eventually lead to costly repairs or replacements. Scale buildup prevention is crucial for maintaining the longevity of your plumbing and appliances.
   **Dry Skin and hair:** Hard water can make it difficult for soap to lather properly. The soap reacts with the minerals, forming a curd that clings to your skin and hair. This can leave your skin feeling dry, itchy, and irritated, and your hair looking dull and lifeless. The effect of hard water on skin and hair is a common complaint among those living in areas with high mineral content in water.
   **Reduced Soap Effectiveness:** The mineral content in water interferes with the ability of soap and detergents to clean effectively. You may find yourself using more soap than usual to achieve the same level of cleanliness, leading to increased costs. Hard water soap scum is a common byproduct of this reaction, leaving unsightly residue on surfaces.
   **Plumbing Damage:** Over time, the accumulation of scale in your pipes can restrict water flow and increase water pressure.This can put a strain on your plumbing system and eventually lead to leaks or bursts, resulting in expensive repairs. Hard water plumbing damage can be a significant concern for homeowners.

## Identifying Your Hard Water Problems: A Water Quality Test

The first step in finding the best water filter for hard water is to determine the severity of your hard water problems.You can do this by conducting a water quality test. A water quality test can reveal the specific mineral content in your water and the TDS in water. You can purchase a DIY test kit at most home improvement stores, or you can hire a professional water testing service.The results of your test will help you determine the appropriate type of water filter for hard water.

## Exploring Different Water Filtration Methods for Hard Water Solutions

There are several different filtration methods available for treating hard water. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's significant to choose the one that best suits your specific needs and budget. Here's an overview of some of the most common hard water solutions:

### 1. Water Softeners: Ion Exchange

Ion exchange water softener systems are the most conventional and effective way to remove hard water minerals. These systems use a process called ion exchange,where calcium and magnesium ions are replaced with sodium or potassium ions,effectively softening the water.

   **Salt-Based Water Softener:** Salt based water softener systems are the most common type of ion exchange softener. They use salt to regenerate the resin beads that facilitate the ion exchange process. These systems are highly effective at removing hardness minerals,but they do require regular salt replenishment.
   **Salt-free Water Softener:** Despite the name, salt free water softener systems are actually water conditioners, not softeners. They don't remove hardness minerals but instead alter their chemical structure to prevent them from forming scale. These systems are generally less effective than salt-based softeners, but they require less maintenance and don't add sodium to the water. These are also known as water conditioner option options. Citric acid water softener and EDTA water softener options fall into this category.

### 2. Water Filters: A Variety of Approaches

While water softeners are the gold standard for removing hardness minerals, certain types of water filters can also help to mitigate the effects of hard water. It's critically important to understand water softener vs filter, as they are not interchangeable in their function.Filters are best at removing sediment and other contaminants, not necessarily calcium and magnesium.

   **Reverse Osmosis (RO) for Hard Water:** Reverse osmosis systems use a semi-permeable membrane to filter out contaminants, including dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium. While RO systems can reduce water hardness, they are primarily designed to remove other contaminants like lead, arsenic, and fluoride. RO systems can be used as a point of use water filter for hard water under the sink or as part of a whole home solution.
   **Sediment Filter:** Sediment filters are designed to remove particulate matter like sand, silt, and rust from water. While they don't directly address hard water minerals, they can help to prevent scale buildup and protect your plumbing and appliances. This serves as hard water sediment filter pretreatment.
   **Carbon Filter:** Carbon filters remove chlorine, taste, and odor from water. They don't soften water, but can make it more palatable and improve the overall drinking experience.
   **KDF Filter for Hard Water:** KDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion) filters use a copper-zinc alloy to remove chlorine, heavy metals, and other contaminants from water. They can also help to inhibit scale buildup and extend the lifespan of your plumbing and appliances. These filters can also reduce some heavy metals.
   **Descaler filters:** Descaler filters use a variety of media, such as polyphosphate, to bind to hardness minerals and prevent them from forming scale. Polyphosphate is also available in a filter format. These filters are effective for relatively small quantities of water, and are commonly used in low.
   **Water Softener Filter Cartridge:** The best water filter for hard water utilizes multiple stages and is easily replaceable.

### 3.Water Softener Alternatives: Exploring Other Options

In addition to traditional water softeners and filters, there are also several water softener alternative methods available for treating hard water. These methods may not be as effective as ion exchange softeners,but they can offer a more convenient or environmentally pleasant solution.

   **electromagnetic Water Conditioners:** These devices use electromagnetic fields to alter the structure of hard water minerals, preventing them from forming scale.They are easy to install and require no maintenance, but their effectiveness is still debated.
   **Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC):** TAC systems use a special media to convert hardness minerals into harmless crystals that don't stick to surfaces. They are salt-free and require no backwashing,making them a low-maintenance option.

## Choosing the Right Water Filter for Hard Water: factors to Consider

Selecting the best water filter for hard water depends on several factors, including:

   **Water Hardness Level:** If your water is only slightly hard, a filter or water softener alternative may be sufficient. However, if your water is extremely hard, you'll likely need a traditional water softener.
   **Water usage:** Consider how much water your household or business uses. For high-demand applications, a whole house water filter for hard water or a commercial-grade water softener may be necessary. For smaller households or point of use applications, a countertop water filter for hard water or under sink water filter for hard water may be sufficient.
   **Budget:** Water softeners can be expensive, both to purchase and to maintain. Filters and water softener alternatives are generally more affordable, but they may not be as effective. Consider hard water filter price when comparing hard water filter options..
   **Maintenance Requirements:** Salt-based water softeners require regular salt replenishment, while filters need to be replaced periodically. Water softener alternatives typically require less maintenance.   **Installation:** Some water filtration systems are easy to install yourself, while others require professional installation. Consider water filter installation costs when making your decision. DIY projects are possible for some systems.
   **Space Constraints:** Point-of-use filters are more compact and suitable for apartments or small spaces, whereas whole-house systems require more room.

## Top Water Filter for Hard Water Reviews and Comparisons (2025)

While individual product recommendations require current market research and testing, let's outline key features to look for in top-rated water filter for hard water solutions in 2025.

   **Brand Reputation:** Look for brands with a proven track record of producing high-quality, reliable water filtration systems. Read water filter for hard water reviews from other customers to get an idea of their experiences.

* **Medium roast:** It provides a balanced flavor with moderate acidity. It’s the most popular choice.
* **Dark roast:** Known for its bold and rich flavor. Less coffee is needed as the beans are already strong.

When measuring coffee, use the following guideline:

|Coffee Type|Tablespoons per 12 Cups|
|:-|:-|
|Light Roast|24-28 tablespoons|
|Medium Roast|20-24 tablespoons|
|Dark Roast|16-20 tablespoons|

Always adjust to your taste preference. Start with the recommended amount and modify as needed.

# Brewing Methods

The brewing method also impacts the amount of coffee used. Each method extracts flavors differently, requiring specific measurements.

**Common brewing methods include:**

* **Drip coffee maker:** The most common method. Use 1-2 tablespoons of coffee per cup, totaling 12-24 tablespoons for 12 cups.
* **French press:** Known for its strong and bold flavor. Use 2 tablespoons of coffee per cup, totaling 24 tablespoons for 12 cups.
* **Pour-over:** This method gives control over brewing time and water temperature. Use 1.5-2 tablespoons per cup, totaling 18-24 tablespoons for 12 cups.

Here’s a quick reference table for brewing methods:

|Brewing Method|Tablespoons per 12 Cups|
|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee Maker|12-24 tablespoons|
|French Press|24 tablespoons|
|Pour-over|18-24 tablespoons|

Experiment with different measurements to find your perfect brew. A well-measured coffee can enhance your coffee experience.

# Standard Coffee Ratios

Brewing the perfect pot of coffee can be a bit of an art. Understanding the right coffee-to-water ratio is key to achieving that perfect cup. For 12 cups, the standard coffee ratios can help guide you. This ensures you have the right strength and flavor every time.

Using tablespoons to measure coffee grounds is common and convenient. It’s essential to get the right amount for consistent taste. For 12 cups of coffee, the general rule is to use 2 tablespoons of coffee per cup of water.

Here’s a simple breakdown:

* 1 cup of coffee = 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds
* 12 cups of coffee = 24 tablespoons of coffee grounds

To put it into perspective, 24 tablespoons equals 1.5 cups of coffee grounds. This measurement ensures your coffee is neither too strong nor too weak. Some people prefer a slightly different ratio. Adjust the tablespoons slightly to match your taste preference.

Using the correct tablespoon measurement is crucial. It ensures the coffee is balanced and flavorful. A heaping tablespoon can make a big difference. Always use level tablespoons for accuracy.

Remember, consistency is key. Use the same tablespoon each time you measure. This helps maintain the same great taste with every brew.

# Cup Sizes

Understanding cup sizes is important in coffee making. Not all cups are created equal. A standard coffee cup size is typically 6 ounces. However, many coffee makers use 5-ounce cups as a standard measure.

Here’s a quick reference for different cup sizes:

|Cup Size|Ounces|
|:-|:-|
|Standard Cup|6 ounces|
|Small Coffee Maker Cup|5 ounces|
|Large Mug|8-12 ounces|

For 12 cups of coffee using a standard 6-ounce cup, you will need 72 ounces of water. If your coffee maker uses 5-ounce cups, you will need 60 ounces of water.

It’s also important to note that some coffee makers have different cup size settings. Always check your coffee maker’s instructions. This helps ensure you use the right amount of water and coffee grounds.

Understanding these cup sizes helps in making perfect coffee. It ensures you use the correct water-to-coffee ratio every time. This results in a consistent and delicious pot of coffee.

# Calculating For 12 Cups

Making coffee for a crowd can be tricky, especially when you need to brew 12 cups. The right coffee-to-water ratio is key to ensuring your coffee tastes just right. Let’s delve into how to calculate the amount of coffee needed for 12 cups.

# General Rule

When brewing coffee, a general rule of thumb is to use 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of water. This translates well to larger quantities. Here’s a simple way to calculate:

* 1 cup of coffee typically equals 6 ounces of water.
* 12 cups of coffee equals 72 ounces of water.
* For 12 cups, you need between 12 to 24 tablespoons of coffee.

Here’s a quick reference table to help you:

|Number of Cups|Ounces of Water|Tablespoons of Coffee|
|:-|:-|:-|
|4|24|4 – 8|
|8|48|8 – 16|
|12|72|12 – 24|

Using these guidelines ensures a well-balanced brew. But remember, personal preferences may vary.

# Adjusting For Taste

Everyone’s taste for coffee is different. Some prefer a strong brew, while others like it milder. Here’s how you can adjust:

* **For a stronger coffee:** Use 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water. This means for 12 cups, use 24 tablespoons (or 1.5 cups) of coffee.
* **For a milder coffee:** Use 1 tablespoon per 6 ounces of water. For 12 cups, use 12 tablespoons (or 3/4 cup) of coffee.

Another method to adjust the strength is by experimenting with the grind size:

* **Finer grind:** Stronger and more intense flavor.
* **Coarser grind:** Milder and less intense flavor.

It’s also essential to consider the coffee brand and roast type, as these factors influence the final taste. Darker roasts tend to be stronger, while lighter roasts are milder.

Keep tweaking until you find your perfect balance. Happy brewing!

# Tools For Measurement

Brewing the perfect cup of coffee requires precision. Knowing how many tablespoons of coffee for 12 cups is key. The right tools for measurement help achieve consistency and taste. Let’s explore two common methods: using a scale and coffee scoops.

# Using A Scale

Using a scale ensures accuracy. This method is popular among coffee enthusiasts. It measures coffee beans or grounds by weight, providing consistent results. Here are some tips for using a scale:

* **Choose a digital scale**: A scale with a tare function is best. It allows you to subtract the weight of the container.
* **Measure in grams**: Coffee is often measured in grams for precision. For 12 cups, you need about 72 grams of coffee.
* **Use a container**: Place your container on the scale and reset it to zero. Add coffee until you reach the desired weight.
* **Consistency is key**: Using a scale ensures you use the same amount every time. This helps maintain the flavor of your coffee.

Here’s a quick reference for measuring coffee:

|Cups of Coffee|Grams of Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|4|24|
|8|48|
|12|72|

Using a scale might seem complex at first. But it guarantees the same great taste every time you brew.

# Coffee Scoops

**Coffee scoops** are a simpler tool. They are widely used in households. Scoops measure coffee by volume. Here’s how you can use coffee scoops for 12 cups:

* **Standard coffee scoop**: One scoop equals about 2 tablespoons of coffee.
* **Measure accurately**: For 12 cups, use 12 scoops. This equals approximately 24 tablespoons.
* **Level your scoop**: Ensure each scoop is level. This prevents using too much or too little coffee.
* **Consistency**: Like a scale, consistent scoops help maintain the desired flavor.

A visual guide can help:

|Cups of Coffee|Scoops of Coffee|Tablespoons of Coffee|
|:-|:-|:-|
|4|4|8|
|8|8|16|
|12|12|24|

Using coffee scoops is straightforward. It is ideal for those who prefer a quick method. Both tools ensure you get the right amount of coffee for 12 cups. Choose the one that fits your style and enjoy a perfect brew every time.

# Brewing Techniques

Are you wondering how many tablespoons of coffee you need for 12 cups? It’s important to get the measurement right to ensure a perfect brew. Different brewing techniques can affect how much coffee you use. Let’s explore some popular methods.

# Drip Coffee Makers

Drip coffee makers are common in households and offices. They are easy to use and produce consistent results. For 12 cups of coffee, the general rule is to use 1-2 tablespoons of coffee per cup. Here’s a simple guide:

* Light coffee: 12 tablespoons (3/4 cup)
* Medium coffee: 18 tablespoons (1 cup + 2 tablespoons)
* Strong coffee: 24 tablespoons (1.5 cups)

Using a standard coffee scoop, which holds about 2 tablespoons, can make measuring easier. Here’s a table for quick reference:

|Strength|Tablespoons|Cups|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Light|12|3/4 cup|
|Medium|18|1 cup + 2 tbsp|
|Strong|24|1.5 cups|

Drip coffee makers often come with a built-in filter basket. Ensure the coffee grounds are evenly spread. Use fresh cold water for the best taste. Cleaning your coffee maker regularly also helps maintain the flavor.

# French Press

The French press method is known for its rich and full-bodied coffee. For 12 cups using a French press, you will need coarsely ground coffee. The ratio of coffee to water is different from drip makers. Generally, use 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of water. Here’s a simple calculation:

* 12 cups = 96 ounces
* 96 ounces / 6 = 16
* 16 servings x 2 tablespoons = 32 tablespoons (2 cups)

For a French press, follow these steps:

1. Measure 32 tablespoons of coarsely ground coffee.
2. Boil water and let it cool for a minute.
3. Add coffee grounds to the French press.
4. Pour hot water over the grounds.
5. Stir gently and place the lid on.
6. Let it steep for 4 minutes.
7. Press the plunger down slowly.

French press coffee requires more attention to timing and grind size. Using too fine grounds can make the coffee bitter. Ensure even stirring to mix the grounds well. Enjoy the robust flavor that a French press offers.

# Common Mistakes

Brewing the perfect cup of coffee is an art. Knowing how many tablespoons of coffee to use for 12 cups is crucial. But many people make common mistakes that affect the taste and quality of their coffee. Let’s explore these common mistakes to help you avoid them.

# Over Or Under Measuring

One of the most common mistakes is over or under measuring coffee. Accurate measurement is key to a great cup of coffee. The standard ratio is 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water. For 12 cups, you need:

* 24 tablespoons for a stronger brew
* 12 tablespoons for a milder taste

Some mistakes people make include:

1. Using a heaping tablespoon instead of a level tablespoon.
2. Eyeballing the amount instead of measuring it.
3. Not adjusting the amount based on the coffee type.

Here’s a simple table to help:

|Cups|Tablespoons|
|:-|:-|
|6|6-12|
|12|12-24|

Always use a level tablespoon. If you prefer a stronger flavor, use more. For a lighter taste, use less. Consistency is key.

# Water Temperature Issues

Water temperature also plays a vital role. The ideal temperature for brewing coffee is between 195°F and 205°F. Common water temperature issues include:

* Using boiling water, which can scorch the coffee.
* Using water that is too cold, leading to under-extraction.
* Not preheating the water, causing inconsistent results.

Here are some tips:

1. Use a thermometer to check water temperature.
2. Boil water and let it sit for 30 seconds before brewing.
3. Preheat your coffee maker for consistent results.

Maintaining the right water temperature ensures a balanced and flavorful cup of coffee. It’s worth the extra effort to get it right.

# Flavor Profiles

Finding the right balance of coffee for 12 cups can be a challenge. Understanding flavor profiles helps. The flavor of your coffee changes based on factors like roast type and origin. Knowing these can help you make a perfect cup every time.

# Light Vs. Dark Roasts

Choosing between light and dark roasts affects the taste of your coffee. Light roasts have a **mild flavor**. They often have fruity or floral notes. Dark roasts are **bolder** with a deeper, richer taste.

Here are some key differences:

* **Light Roasts:**
   * More acidic
   * Higher caffeine content
   * Retains original flavors of the bean
* **Dark Roasts:**
   * Less acidic
   * Lower caffeine content
   * More bitter, smoky taste

To make 12 cups of coffee:

|Roast Type|Tablespoons of Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|Light Roast|24 tablespoons|
|Dark Roast|22 tablespoons|

Light roasts need more coffee to achieve the same strength as dark roasts. This is because light roasts are denser and have more moisture.

# Single Origin Vs. Blends

Single origin coffees come from one specific region. They have unique flavors. Blends mix beans from different places. This creates a balanced flavor profile.

**Single origin:**

* Distinctive taste
* Traceable to a specific region
* Often more expensive

**Blends:**

* Consistent flavor
* Combines the best qualities of different beans
* Usually more affordable

Here’s a comparison for 12 cups:

|Type|Tablespoons of Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|Single Origin|25 tablespoons|
|Blends|24 tablespoons|

Single origin coffees often need more coffee to showcase their unique flavors. Blends are designed to be consistent, so they require less adjustment.

# Adjusting For Preferences

When brewing coffee, the number of tablespoons you use is crucial for achieving your desired strength. For 12 cups, the standard measure is typically around 24 tablespoons. Adjusting this amount allows you to tailor the coffee to your preferences, whether you like it stronger or milder.

# Stronger Coffee

If you prefer a more robust flavor, you can increase the amount of coffee grounds. A stronger brew intensifies the taste and aroma, which many coffee lovers enjoy. Here are some tips to achieve stronger coffee:

* **Increase the coffee grounds:** Instead of 24 tablespoons, try using 30 to 36 tablespoons.
* **Use finer grounds:** Finer grounds extract more flavor, making the coffee taste stronger.
* **Consider dark roast:** Dark roast coffee beans naturally have a stronger flavor.

The table below shows the recommended measurements for a stronger brew:

|Strength|Tablespoons|
|:-|:-|
|Standard|24|
|Strong|30|
|Extra Strong|36|

Experimenting with these adjustments can help you find the perfect balance for your taste.

# Milder Coffee

If a milder coffee is what you prefer, reducing the amount of coffee grounds will help. A milder brew has a softer taste, which can be more enjoyable for those sensitive to strong flavors. Here are some suggestions:

* **Reduce the coffee grounds:** Instead of 24 tablespoons, try using 18 to 20 tablespoons.
* **Use coarser grounds:** Coarser grounds extract less flavor, resulting in a milder taste.
* **Consider light roast:** Light roast beans typically produce a milder flavor.

The table below shows the recommended measurements for a milder brew:

|Strength|Tablespoons|
|:-|:-|
|Standard|24|
|Mild|20|
|Extra Mild|18|

Adjusting the coffee grounds and experimenting with different roasts can help you achieve the perfect mild coffee flavor.

1jz580r,https://i.redd.it/zefgjpuj9uue1.png,Landed My Consulting Role at Bain After MIT Sloan MBA,"Hello Everyone !!!!

I’m beyond excited (and a little emotional) to share that I’ve just landed a Consultant Role at Bain & Company!  

When I applied to Sloan with 4 years of work experience in product and strategy roles in India, I wasn’t sure if I was experienced enough for a top MBA. I also applied with a GMAT waiver, which made me even more nervous but I trusted my story, my intent, and the clarity I had around what I wanted to do post-MBA. Sloan saw that, and gave me a shot. That changed everything.

The last two years have been nothing short of life changing. Sloan is rigorous. The kind of place where your classmates will stay up late helping you prep for case interviews, and then drag you to a C-Function to make sure you don’t take life too seriously. My cohort was brilliant, people from all over the world, with stories and journeys so different from mine, but somehow we all clicked. We learned from each other, and challenged each other too.

Consulting was always the goal, but it wasn’t easy. There were rejections, frustrating days, and a lot of self-doubt. But the Sloan support system (shoutout to my career coach and the alumni who never said no to a coffee chat) really carried me through.

Now, as I wrap up this chapter, I just feel incredibly grateful for the growth, the friendships, and the fact that I get to take all of this into a role I’ve dreamed of. Post-MBA life feels like a fresh start with a stronger voice, a global network, and a full heart 

If you’re someone who’s thinking about applying with only 4 years of experience, or worried about waiving the GMAT, I see you. And I hope my story reminds you that your journey is valid, and your dreams are more than possible  

From Bangalore to Bain. I have come a long way

Alright, so I finally gave in and tried out the [Bialetti](https://www.bialetti.com/it_en/) electric espresso maker - and I’ve gotta say, I’m actually kinda obsessed

I’d been using pod machines (mostly ~~Nescafe~~) for a while because yeah they’re convenient. But I always felt like the flavor was a bit lacking. Made me think back to the oldschool stovetop moka pots I used to mess with ages ago - loved the coffee, but hated babysitting the thing to avoid burning it.

This electric version? Way less stress. There’s even a little chime when the coffee’s done (sounds a bit like some meditational tune), which is way better than guessing.

**Bonus**: it keeps the coffee warm for a bit after brewing. No rush if you’re not slamming it down immediately.

What I really love is how you can set a timer. Seriously, **waking up to the smell of fresh coffee** already waiting? Game changer. Totally addictive. (Took me two mornings to get hooked)

Also, a nice bonus for anyone who cares about this stuff: Bialetti actually **manufactures in Italy, Romania, and Turkey**. So it’s not just designed in Europe, but produced here too. Makes it feel like a proper EU alternative to the typical pod machines from big global brands.

Small heads-up though - this thing isn’t cheap. Even second-hand ones. Also, it’s built well enough, but some of the plastic parts feel a bit budget. Oh, and the ""6 cups""(on the label) is more like 6 espresso shots - so don’t expect full mugs unless you top it up with hot water.

But honestly? **Totally worth it** if you love good coffee and want that old-school espresso flavor without messing around on the stove every morning.

Anyone else using [Bialetti](https://www.bialetti.com/it_en/)?

# Key Features to Compare: What Matters Most?

# 1. Sound Quality

* **My Take**: Sound is king, right? The **Sony WH-1000XM5** edges out the pack with its hi-res audio and balanced profile—perfect for picking out every detail in a song. **Bose QuietComfort Ultra** nails immersion with spatial audio, while **Beats Studio Pro** leans hard into bass, which I love for hip-hop but less for classical. **Apple AirPods Max** shines with Spatial Audio and clarity, especially if you’re in Apple’s world. **Logitech G Astro A50 X** is a gaming champ with precise directional sound, though it’s less versatile for music.

I will be moving to the Isle of Wight some time in mid to late June to live with my boyfriend and all of our fur babies (1 big dog, and 3 cats)! I'm a female in my late 20s and my boyfriend is in his early 30s.

What are some good ways to make friends on the island? 

I love to walk/hike/be outside in general, live music (of many genres), love animals, food, coffee, beer, tattoos, thrifting/vintage shopping, skating, paddleboarding to name a few things. I also just love staying in with movies and building Lego or doing other cozy things. We also are going to attend the IOW Festival.",3,1744653118.0,isleofwight,2,1.0,False

Can anyone recommend if there's places to chill at and work in Dubai mall with charger ports? I'll probably be at a cafe for 2 hours but would wanna move around after.

I'm a 27F and have been with my 28M boyfriend for three years now. Things have mostly been good between us, but there's always been a lingering issue involving his ex.

Even before we got together, she was a presence in his life. They had dated for nearly two years before she broke up with him for ""personal reasons."" However, she kept him close as a ""best friend"" for about a year afterwards, occasionally giving him false hope of rekindling the relationship. Meanwhile, she had other flings and situationships, and he was still very much in love with her and struggling to move on.

When he finally met me and told her he was interested in someone new, she made him choose between her and me. At that time, we barely knew each other, and he chose her. I was hurt, and we stopped talking after that. Apparently, after he told her that he is willing to try again with her, she became distant started cancelling plans and dismissing him. One thing led to another, and we ended up giving it a real try. We’ve now been together for three years.

During that time, she reached out to him twice, once on his birthday, trying to start a conversation (which he shut down and then deleted her from social media), and again after his graduation, when she asked him out for coffee ""to explain some things."" He obv declined.

The current issue is... complicated. She’s now become really good friends with one of *my* friends; let’s call her Gill. Ever since, Gill has grown distant from me and now hangs out with my boyfriend’s ex every other day. I can't help but feel uncomfortable about it. It feels like this girl is slowly inserting herself into my life again after all those years.

Recently, my boyfriend’s friend group planned a board game night. Gill wanted to bring the ex along and even “warned” my boyfriend that she would be there. She told him it would be ""awkward"" if he showed up (essentially uninviting him). The rest of the friend group seems to like her a lot and dismissed his discomfort completely. When he tried to explain how hurtful the situation was, especially given their history, Gill told him to “get over it” because “it’s been years.” and that if he truly feels that uncomfortable around her, he needs to work on himself.

I feel betrayed by Gill. It’s like she’s allowing this person (who hurt both me and my boyfriend) to wedge herself into our circle. And somehow, I feel like history is repeating itself. I worked really hard to overcome retroactive jealousy and insecurity, even went to therapy for it. But now, I feel like I’m back at square one. It feels like she’s taking over my space and stealing the people in my life, just like before.

I don’t know what to do. I feel excluded, anxious, and incredibly sad. On top of everything, I live abroad and can't have a face to face conversation with them. No one seems to take it seriously. I’m questioning all of my friendships and wondering if I’m just being too sensitive, or if I should go back to therapy to work through these feelings again.

Any advice would be appreciated. Has anyone been through something similar? Am I missing something obvious here?

But also maybe move around a couple hours. So not like limited to just one cafe, but also I don't drink so much coffee lol, so can't be going on a Russian roulette to try every coffee at every store.

Can anyone recommend if there's places to chill at and work in Dubai mall with charger ports? I'll probably be at a cafe for 2 hours but would wanna move around after.

And if not Dubai mall, I'm open to suggestions.

Size & Design

* **My Take**: I hate when a plug hogs both outlets—looking at you, old WeMo. The [Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091699Z3W?tag=gadgetcompare-20) is my design darling: tiny and unobtrusive. The [Govee Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X448XHR?tag=gadgetcompare-20) and [EIGHTREE Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLNPQBGQ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) get bulky points, though—sometimes I can’t fit two side-by-side. The [Philips Hue Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XD578LD?tag=gadgetcompare-20) blends in stylishly, which I adore for my minimalist vibe.
* **Table**:

|Product|Size (inches)|Design Notes|User Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Amazon Smart Plug|3.2 x 1.5 x 2.2|Compact, blocks 2nd outlet|“Larger than I thought—plan your spot!” – Mike Mass|
|GHome Smart Plug|2.1 x 2.1 x 1.1|Small but round|“Small but can block the other outlet.” – Cindy R.|
|Govee Smart Plug|1.96 x 1.96 x 2.36|Compact, covers 2nd outlet|“Size covers both outlets—annoying!” – Matthew Willis|
|Philips Hue Smart Plug|2.7 x 1.5 x 2.1|Sleek, unobtrusive|“Blends into my decor perfectly!” – Brandon|
|Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini|2.36 x 2.03 x 1.5|Ultra-mini, outlet-friendly|“Small size leaves the other outlet free!” – Kindle Customer|
|EIGHTREE Smart Plug|1 x 1 x 1 (approx.)|Round, potentially bulky|“Bulky round design interferes with adjacent outlet.” – DivaJe|

* **Gripe**: Govee and EIGHTREE—slim down a bit, please!

# 5. App Experience

* **My Take**: A clunky app can ruin the fun. The [Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091699Z3W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)’s Kasa app is a delight—intuitive, with extras like “Away” mode that I’ve used to fake presence on trips. The [Govee Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X448XHR?tag=gadgetcompare-20)’s app is sleek too, though some find it laggy. I’m less thrilled with Smart Life (used by [GHome](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7ZXYPRL?tag=gadgetcompare-20) and [EIGHTREE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLNPQBGQ?tag=gadgetcompare-20))—it’s functional but feels generic.
* **Table**:

|Product|App|App Features|User Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Amazon Smart Plug|Alexa|Basic control, routines|“Alexa app is simple but does the job.” – T. Vello|
|GHome Smart Plug|Smart Life|Timers, group control|“App’s easy but not fancy.” – Cindy R.|
|Govee Smart Plug|Govee Home|Schedules, group control|“App’s intuitive—love the options!” – dragonlord|
|Philips Hue Smart Plug|Hue|Advanced lighting control|“Hue app is top-notch with Bridge!” – Tom Tomato|
|Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini|Kasa Smart|Timers, Away mode, stats|“Kasa app is great—tons of features!” – Josh F|
|EIGHTREE Smart Plug|Smart Life|Timers, scenes, sharing|“App’s overcomplicated for one fan.” – S. R. Nassif|

* **Dream**: Smart Life could use a glow-up—less clutter, more charm.

# 6. Price vs. Value

* **My Take**: I’m all about getting my money’s worth. The [Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091699Z3W?tag=gadgetcompare-20) at $7.98 feels like a steal for its features. The [EIGHTREE Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLNPQBGQ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) and [GHome Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7ZXYPRL?tag=gadgetcompare-20) are wallet-friendly too, especially in packs. The [Philips Hue Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XD578LD?tag=gadgetcompare-20) at $34.99 stings unless you’re Hue-obsessed—I’d rather grab two Kasas.
* **Table**:

|Product|Price (1-Pack)|Value Notes|User Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Amazon Smart Plug|$24.99|High for Alexa-only|“Too pricey for one plug—I’d try cheaper brands.” – Diana|
|GHome Smart Plug|$9.99|Great budget buy|“Cheap and easy—5 stars!” – BD|
|Govee Smart Plug|$12.99|Solid mid-range value|“Worth it for reliability!” – Reviewer|
|Philips Hue Smart Plug|$34.99|Premium for Hue users|“Pricey, but seamless with Hue!” – CDV|
|Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini|$7.98 (deal)|Best bang for buck|“Great value—cheaper than WeMo and better!” – TechPicky|
|EIGHTREE Smart Plug|$7.99|Awesome 4-pack deal|“Fantastic price for 4—game-changer!” – Onahunch|

# 7. Special Features

* **My Take**: Timers are my jam—I’ve got my fan humming before I stumble out of bed. All these plugs offer them, but [Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091699Z3W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)’s Away mode adds a security twist I adore. The [Philips Hue Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XD578LD?tag=gadgetcompare-20) flexes with Hue’s lighting magic (if you’ve got the Bridge). None have energy monitoring, though—missed chance to geek out on watts.

|Amazon Smart Plug|Routines via Alexa|“Morning routine with coffee maker—magic!” – Brianna|

* **Quibble**: Philips could ditch the Bridge dependency for basic use—feels like a cash grab.

# 3. Connectivity

* **My Take**: Nothing’s worse than a plug that drops the ball mid-vacation. The [Govee Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X448XHR?tag=gadgetcompare-20)’s WiFi + Bluetooth combo feels like a safety net—I’ve had zero hiccups even during a storm-induced outage. The [Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091699Z3W?tag=gadgetcompare-20) auto-reconnects like a champ too. The [Philips Hue Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XD578LD?tag=gadgetcompare-20) leans on Zigbee with a Bridge, which is rock-solid but overkill for solo use. Some [GHome Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7ZXYPRL?tag=gadgetcompare-20) users gripe about occasional drops, which worries me for remote control.

Alright, so I finally gave in and tried out the [Bialetti](https://www.bialetti.com/it_en/) electric espresso maker - and I’ve gotta say, I’m actually kinda obsessed

I’d been using pod machines (mostly ~~Nescafe~~) for a while because yeah they’re convenient. But I always felt like the flavor was a bit lacking. Made me think back to the oldschool stovetop moka pots I used to mess with ages ago - loved the coffee, but hated babysitting the thing to avoid burning it.

This electric version? Way less stress. There’s even a little chime when the coffee’s done (sounds a bit like some meditational tune), which is way better than guessing.

**Bonus**: it keeps the coffee warm for a bit after brewing. No rush if you’re not slamming it down immediately.

What I really love is how you can set a timer. Seriously, **waking up to the smell of fresh coffee** already waiting? Game changer. Totally addictive. (Took me two mornings to get hooked)

Also, a nice bonus for anyone who cares about this stuff: Bialetti actually **manufactures in Italy, Romania, and Turkey**. So it’s not just designed in Europe, but produced here too. Makes it feel like a proper EU alternative to the typical pod machines from big global brands.

Small heads-up though - this thing isn’t cheap. Even second-hand ones. Also, it’s built well enough, but some of the plastic parts feel a bit budget. Oh, and the ""6 cups""(on the label) is more like 6 espresso shots - so don’t expect full mugs unless you top it up with hot water.

But honestly? **Totally worth it** if you love good coffee and want that old-school espresso flavor without messing around on the stove every morning.

# Key Features

# 1. Video Quality

**Subjective Winner**: [Hiseeu C90-SP-V](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGNFRS5X?tag=gadgetcompare-20)  
Why? Its 4MP resolution edges out the 2K competitors, delivering sharper details—crucial for identifying faces or license plates from a distance. I imagine peering at footage of a late-night raccoon raid; with Hiseeu, I’d spot every whisker.

Why? Its 4MP resolution edges out the 2K competitors, delivering sharper details—crucial for identifying faces or license plates from a distance. I imagine peering at footage of a late-night raccoon raid; with Hiseeu, I’d spot every whisker.

# 2. Coverage & Motion Tracking

# 3. Power & Battery Life

**Subjective Winner**: [Cinnado B6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFBQNGTX?tag=gadgetcompare-20)  
Why? Its 5000mAh battery and solar efficiency impressed me most. One user ran it unplugged for 19 days at 100%—perfect for a cloudy winter week when I’d rather stay cozy indoors.

**Subjective Winner**: [eufy Security T8134](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ55JZ4S?tag=gadgetcompare-20)

I was on 20mg previously and even tried adderall again which was just a flop altogether. I had no issues with adderrall when I first got diagnosed but this time around it made me extremely drowsy and I felt almost comatose (apparently that can happen if your symptoms have gotten more severe?). Currently the 30mg of Vyvanse just isn’t giving me any relief, it’s basically the equivalent of having a shot of espresso for me. I even still drink coffee with it just to get that extra boost of energy. I’m curious what were your experiences when you had the right dose? Could it be time to call up my doctor?

1jz501q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jz501q/is_it_wrong_to_expect_more_from_my_boyfriend_of/,Is it wrong to expect more from my boyfriend of three years after he cheated? (Long),"My(23) bf(24)of three years cheated on me a year ago. We are still dealing with the after effects as I do bring it up, sometimes when we are arguing. After he cheated I stated I’m going to expect more and have higher expectations. I moved in with him for 5 months to work and go to school and he was cheating the whole time(Nothing physical, but it was multiple girls he was talking to and receiving nudes). Now, It’s going to be a year since he graduated, and had a job. I’ve been begging him to do more, at least for our relationship. I want to wake up to breakfast, my coffee made. Be served while I’m playing games. I envy him be able to have a break. I share a room with two people, I don’t have a car or license, and he doesn’t have a car as it got totaled, but seeing each other (we’re 40 mins away) is on me. My family is kind enough to constantly take me there and back. I always surprise him with meals I’ve made, snacks, lingerie. I’m a super clean person as well. The past year, he had been doing nothing but playing games, watching shows and having a messed up sleeping schedule. I’m a full time student. I stopped working and only go to school since last semester. When I started going at him, because he’s technically still in school, he needs to take a few more tests to become an AMT, he said he was burnt out. But it’s been a year. And none of my needs are being met. When I bring it up, how I feel he’s not appreciating me and everything I do, he says doesn’t he do what he can. But it’s no longer consistent. I’m lucky if he cleans his room for me when I go over. And it’s super messy, or wash my towels. And this past time I brought up how I envied him relaxing, he snapped and said “You envy me? Do you have a dad? I have to live with everyday. Don’t ever ask me why I don’t open up”. (He lost his dad around 4 years old) But how was I supposed to respond to that? I said that’s not what I meant and would never say or do that, that I just envy the current things he’s doing. He stated “When I want to do something sometimes, yes you show gratitude. But then you want more. You always want more it’s never good enough. You want a lot of things. So that’s why I stopped doing things as often. It’s never enough. You’re always trying to change me” in response to everything I’ve been asking for. When I don’t think asking him to match my actions is too much. I feel he’s currently not doing anything, so why can’t you organize a ride to come see me? Or even ask my parents to pick you up as a surprise? Clean before I go, study at least twice a week, make me food, surprise me with snacks or coffee in the morning, just all the things I do. He’s even using all our streaming services that I secretly gave him. I recently started posting clips of me gaming. A random guy sent me a code for 10 bucks on my gaming account. My face or body isn’t shown on there. I accepted and shouted him out. That’s was it. I told him and he ghosted me two days. When I called, I said how are you okay with not talking to your partner of three years over this? That he didn’t give me the opportunity to apologize or even speak on it. That even after he cheated, I call the next day to discuss my feelings. He said I know why he’s upset and he doesn’t have to explain anything. That I always think it’s funny and “did you think I would laugh with you?”. I snapped. And I said “a random guy sends me 10 bucks, and I’m completely transparent about it. Girls would send you nudes that you would seek out, but oh this is horrible and worth ghosting me over”. I shouldn’t have brought it up as it was supposed to be about one topic. But he went off saying how, despite me never giving him a reason, he doesn’t trust me. I’m going to LA in November for a concert, and he said even though I invited him he’s not going to. But he’s worried I’m going to be flirty, accept drinks from guys and one thing will lead to another. I was stunned as this is not my personality. I’m a home body, have social anxiety, don’t drink often, and have never spoken or flirted with another man. He said he’s been feeling depressed, anxiety, and burnt out because it all goes back to him cheating. That he has to live with it and deals with it day and night. And that I don’t help as when he tries to talk to me about it, I get upset, and I’ve been asking for all these things making him constantly feel like he’s not good enough. And I do. Because I do feel, how are you the one who’s hurt and wanting comfort when you made the choice to cheat on me? I comforted him and babied him after I found out more than he ever comforted me, and I’m still upset about that too. I even asked if he could talk to a therapist as talking to the person he cheated who hasn’t healed completely isn’t helping him heal. But he didn’t go. And right now we’re in a toxic environment with each other, as he’s not meeting my expectations and needs when it comes to visiting me, and doing things for me, and I’m not meeting his emotional needs. How do I listen better and understand his side? And is it wrong of me to expect more and ask for the things I’m asking for? How do I avoid bringing it up as after this, I do realize I made a choice to stay so I can’t bring it up every time I get mad as now that’s on me. It’s been a year we’ve dealing with this, and in all honestly, I feel that since he cheated, he should be treating me better and listening when I’m saying I’m not happy and this is what I need. But I feel he’s treated me worse and just went downhill, not only because of the guilt, but because of me reacting bad whenever he brings it up. He can’t open up to me about it because I get triggered and now I feel childish about it. But I also feel I am not asking for the world. I understand he’s going through it with his mental health, but again, it’s been a year. I feel like I’ve waited long enough for things to get better and they haven’t. But I truly love him and think this is a rough patch. But now I don’t know. I’m not healed and he’s not healed. And we’re battling opposites sides. Any advice and if we can survive this?

# Key Features to Compare in Wireless Earbuds

# 1. Sound Quality

* **Subjective Winner**: [JBL Vibe Beam Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQPNMXQV?tag=gadgetcompare-20) JBL’s reputation shines here with a balanced sound profile—deep bass that doesn’t drown out mids and highs. I’d pick these for jamming to rock or hip-hop in my backyard, where clarity matters as much as punch.
* **Comparison Table**:

|Product|Driver Size|Sound Features|User Comment Example|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[HUIFU Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTHWYM8W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|13mm|Deep bass, clear treble|“The bass had me think the couch was shaking” – Tom Throckmorton|
|[TOZO A1 Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FT58QQP?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|6mm|Wide sound range, OrigX tech|“The bass isn’t the best but they are noise-cancelling” – NotYourAbuela|
|[JBL Vibe Beam Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQPNMXQV?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|8mm|Deep bass, balanced response|“A more balanced frequency response than out of the box” – P. Dobrinen|
|[Soundcore by Anker P20i Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTYCRJSS?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|10mm|Big bass, detailed sound|“Sound is neutral and clean – not bass heavy or trebly” – MDuck|
|[TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|10mm|Stereo bass, OrigX 2.0 tech|“The sound quality is crisp and clear, with a rich bass” – John D. Robinson|

* **My Take**: HUIFU and TOZO Hybrid ANC pack bigger drivers for bass lovers, but JBL’s tuning feels more refined. TOZO A1’s smaller driver struggles with depth—fine for podcasts, less so for music.

# 2. Battery Life

* **Subjective Winner**: [TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) At 59 hours total (ANC off), these outlast the rest. I could use them for a week-long road trip without worrying about a charger.
* **Comparison Table**:

|Product|Earbud Life|Total w/ Case|Fast Charge|User Comment Example|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[HUIFU Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTHWYM8W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|8H|40H|15min = 90min|“You won’t believe how long the charge lasts” – Kade Nilsson|

|[TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|14H (ANC off)|59H (ANC off)|2H full charge|“I get a solid 5 hours on a single charge” – John D. Robinson|

* **My Take**: Soundcore P20i’s 10-hour single charge is clutch for long flights, but TOZO Hybrid ANC’s total playtime is unbeatable. HUIFU’s fast charge is a lifesaver for quick gym sessions.

# 3. Comfort and Fit

* **Subjective Winner**: [TOZO A1 Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FT58QQP?tag=gadgetcompare-20) Weighing just 3.7g each, these feel like nothing—perfect for my sensitive ears during long Zoom calls.
* **Comparison Table**:

|Product|Weight (per bud)|Ear Tip Sizes|User Comment Example|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[HUIFU Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTHWYM8W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|4.4g|S/M/L|“They fit right in my ears!!!” – Marcos Albuquerque|
|[TOZO A1 Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FT58QQP?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|3.7g|XS/S/M/XL/XXL|“Their small size and light weight make them the most comfortable” – Kenatug|
|[JBL Vibe Beam Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQPNMXQV?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Not specified|S/M/L|“Slight discomfort at the top of my ear canal” – Andy M|
|[Soundcore by Anker P20i Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTYCRJSS?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Not specified|S/M/L|“These fit perfectly in my ears, and the tips are comfortable” – Hunter|
|[TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Not specified|XS/S/M/L/XL/XXL|“Comfortable enough to wear for about 3 hours” – Grace Caple|

* **My Take**: TOZO A1’s featherlight design and extra sizes win for comfort. JBL’s stick-closed fit might not suit everyone—I’d tweak it with aftermarket tips.

# 4. Water Resistance

* **Subjective Winner**: [TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) IPX8 is top-tier—great for rainy runs or sweaty HIIT sessions without a second thought.
* **Comparison Table**:

|Product|Rating|User Comment Example|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[HUIFU Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTHWYM8W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|IPX7|“Worry free to run without batteries” – Marcos Albuquerque|
|[TOZO A1 Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FT58QQP?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|IPX5|“Not for sweaty workouts” – R Parker (implied limitation)|
|[JBL Vibe Beam Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQPNMXQV?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|IP54|“They never have \[fallen out\] under the most aggressive workouts” – R Ryan|
|[Soundcore by Anker P20i Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTYCRJSS?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Water-resistant (not specified)|“They fell in the cat’s water bowl once, dried off + worked just fine!” – Cherie|
|[TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|IPX8|“Perfect for outdoor activities” – aristarc091|

* **My Take**: TOZO Hybrid ANC’s IPX8 is overkill in a good way. HUIFU’s IPX7 is close behind, while JBL’s IP54 feels more limited for heavy sweat.

# 5. Noise Cancellation

* **Subjective Winner**: [TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) Hybrid ANC up to 45dB quiets a noisy coffee shop better than the rest—I’d use these on a loud bus.
* **Comparison Table**:

|Product|Noise Cancellation|User Comment Example|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[HUIFU Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTHWYM8W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|None|“No mention of noise cancellation” – General observation|
|[TOZO A1 Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FT58QQP?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Passive (sound isolation)|“They are noise-cancelling, which I was surprised to see” – NotYourAbuela|
|[JBL Vibe Beam Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQPNMXQV?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Passive (closed design)|“Not noise-cancelling but snug fit helps” – R Parker|
|[Soundcore by Anker P20i Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTYCRJSS?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Passive (sound isolation)|“Noise isolation is good even at low volumes” – Hunter|
|[TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Hybrid ANC (45dB)|“The Noise Cancelling is so perfect” – Mimi|

# Let’s Stir the Pot: Discussion Topics

1. **ANC Worth It Under $50?** TOZO Hybrid ANC brings noise cancellation to the table, but is it worth $20 more than passive options like Soundcore P20i? I say yes for noisy commutes—what’s your take?
2. **Brand vs. Budget: JBL Overkill?** JBL’s $49.95 price tag is steep here. Does the brand name justify it, or are you better off with HUIFU’s $19.99 bang-for-buck?
3. **Bass vs. Balance: What’s Your Priority?** HUIFU and Soundcore lean into bass, while JBL balances it out. Which matters more to you—thumping lows or crisp all-around sound?

Drop your thoughts below—I’d love to hear how these play out in your world!

# Final Thoughts and Where to Buy

This comparison shows there’s no one-size-fits-all winner—each earbud shines in its niche. I’m torn between TOZO Hybrid ANC for its ANC and battery life and TOZO A1 for its crazy-low price and comfort. If I could tweak one thing, I’d boost TOZO A1’s bass a tad for music-heavy days.

* **My Take**: Soundcore P20i’s 10-hour single charge is clutch for long flights, but TOZO Hybrid ANC’s total playtime is unbeatable. HUIFU’s fast charge is a lifesaver for quick gym sessions.

# 3. Comfort and Fit

* **Subjective Winner**: [TOZO A1 Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FT58QQP?tag=gadgetcompare-20) Weighing just 3.7g each, these feel like nothing—perfect for my sensitive ears during long Zoom calls.

* **My Take**: TOZO A1’s featherlight design and extra sizes win for comfort. JBL’s stick-closed fit might not suit everyone—I’d tweak it with aftermarket tips.

# 4. Water Resistance

* **Subjective Winner**: [TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) IPX8 is top-tier—great for rainy runs or sweaty HIIT sessions without a second thought.
* **Comparison Table**:

|Product|Rating|User Comment Example|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[HUIFU Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTHWYM8W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|IPX7|“Worry free to run without batteries” – Marcos Albuquerque|
|[TOZO A1 Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FT58QQP?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|IPX5|“Not for sweaty workouts” – R Parker (implied limitation)|
|[JBL Vibe Beam Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQPNMXQV?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|IP54|“They never have \[fallen out\] under the most aggressive workouts” – R Ryan|
|[Soundcore by Anker P20i Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTYCRJSS?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Water-resistant (not specified)|“They fell in the cat’s water bowl once, dried off + worked just fine!” – Cherie|

* **My Take**: TOZO Hybrid ANC’s IPX8 is overkill in a good way. HUIFU’s IPX7 is close behind, while JBL’s IP54 feels more limited for heavy sweat.

# 5. Noise Cancellation

* **Subjective Winner**: [TOZO NC9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) [Hybrid ANC Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD41G2NZ?tag=gadgetcompare-20) Hybrid ANC up to 45dB quiets a noisy coffee shop better than the rest—I’d use these on a loud bus.
* **Comparison Table**:

|Product|Noise Cancellation|User Comment Example|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[HUIFU Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTHWYM8W?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|None|“No mention of noise cancellation” – General observation|

|[Soundcore by Anker P20i Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTYCRJSS?tag=gadgetcompare-20)|Passive (sound isolation)|“Noise isolation is good even at low volumes” – Hunter|

* **My Take**: Only TOZO Hybrid ANC offers true ANC. Others rely on passive isolation—decent, but not enough for loud environments.

# 6. Connectivity and App Support

* **My Take**: TOZO Hybrid ANC’s IPX8 is overkill in a good way. HUIFU’s IPX7 is close behind, while JBL’s IP54 feels more limited for heavy sweat.

# Let’s Stir the Pot: Discussion Topics

1. **ANC Worth It Under $50?** TOZO Hybrid ANC brings noise cancellation to the table, but is it worth $20 more than passive options like Soundcore P20i? I say yes for noisy commutes—what’s your take?
2. **Brand vs. Budget: JBL Overkill?** JBL’s $49.95 price tag is steep here. Does the brand name justify it, or are you better off with HUIFU’s $19.99 bang-for-buck?
3. **Bass vs. Balance: What’s Your Priority?** HUIFU and Soundcore lean into bass, while JBL balances it out. Which matters more to you—thumping lows or crisp all-around sound?

Drop your thoughts below—I’d love to hear how these play out in your world!

# Final Thoughts and Where to Buy

This comparison shows there’s no one-size-fits-all winner—each earbud shines in its niche. I’m torn between TOZO Hybrid ANC for its ANC and battery life and TOZO A1 for its crazy-low price and comfort. If I could tweak one thing, I’d boost TOZO A1’s bass a tad for music-heavy days.

1jz4ygz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jz4ygz/my_dad_died_and_left_behind_halfsiblings_i_feel/,My dad died and left behind half-siblings. I feel chained to them,"I (32F) was a teenage pregnancy. My mom and dad never married and called it quits when I was 7 due to dad's raging alcoholism and Xanax abuse. When I was 17, my dad had a surprise baby with a off-and-on girlfriend, and another with her when I was 19. Go figure that months after the second one was born, she skipped out on everything - I'm not 100% if she relinquished parental rights completely, but she's never seen them since. Never found her social media and the only evidence is old arrest records for battery. 

Well, dad died of cancer a few years ago. It was hard because we had a complex relationship where I was low- to no-contact for most of my teen years and adulthood. He spent his last coherent words apologizing to me.

Nowadays my two teenage half-siblings (15F and 13M) are with our paternal grandfather who has custody of them. He seems to be in very early dementia, so I got pulled into a big group chat by our aunts and uncles, like an intervention, asking if I wanted to take them in and adopt them.

I don't. And I said as much. I'm childfree, struggle a lot with mental health behind the scenes, and am constantly playing financial catchup to survive. The last thing I want is to be a surprise parent to my addict dad's surprise kids - especially the boy. I hate to say that. 

The older sister I could - if it came down between me and a random foster - handle. I was actually very emotionally attached to her when she was born until I distanced myself from dad. She's always been calm and collected, but hilarious and unafraid to be candid about her feelings. 

However the younger brother is a totally different story. He has BPD and autism diagnoses and is apparently ""not safe around small children"" - MY AUNTS AND UNCLES WOULDN'T TELL ME WHAT THAT MEANT. Even when I demanded it before continuing the conversation. He also struggles with extreme depression and has been Baker Acted three times.  

At the end of this ""intervention"", they said it's my choice, but I could feel their disdain and they haven't spoken to me much since. My grandfather doesn't answer the phone much nowadays, lives 2 hours away, and my only reliable way of knowing (for the past few months) that they're not in fosters is my half-sister who reliably sends me TikToks... and my half-brother who just absolutely spams me. 

That's my other gripe. I've tried setting boundaries in a tween-friendly way about what's appropriate, but again he doesn't seem to understand that. I work a lot and am already really overwhelmed easily because I have my own little crises to work through - and he messages me nonstop. If I don't answer he will text ""Hello?"" ""????"" ""(My name)"" ""(My name)?????"" and call me. He wants to talk on the phone every day, multiple times a day, and when I've done so he  walks away from the phone have the time or just sits repeating the same questions over and over. He wants to Facetime every day for me to watch and comment on his games. 

The times in past years I've taken them on a group activity (aquarium, arcade, park, mall, botanical garden, etc.) the sister is a peach but the brother typically has a meltdown, especially if sister and I are doing an activity. We spent the afternoon at an arcade where I played with both evenly, and a few tjings with the brother, and as soon as I played one game with the sister he disappeared. I had to find him and he was crying in a game booth saying this was too much and he needed to go. The arcade was empty and he had been overtly having a blast. For his birthday, he wanted to do the aquarium and I made sure it was about him that day and he was fine. On his sister's birthday, we had to leave her historu museum trip early because he started shaking and crying on the benches, saying that ""the vibes are bad, this is a bad place"" (I am not making that up, but I think that verbiage is normal with this wave of tweens). I tried finding a chill quiet space, water, and snack for him and he just repeated ""I need to go home"" over and over. We went home but when I tried to take his sister back out for a coffee/drink/etc he said something like ""I want (sister) to stay with me and play games, I'll feel better""

...

So you can see where I'm at. I strongly suspect the brother is manipulative, but don't want to project my frustrations and outright believe that. 

I'm frankly sick of hearing from him, sick of being around him. It's just a reminder of the mess my dad left behind. I feel horrible for them both, especially him. They were thrown into a really crappy life circumstance. They have their own issues, likely because the mom was continuously smoking, drinking, and also abusing Xanax to my knowledge. 

But it's not my problem. They're not my kids. There's a huge age gap and I have difficulty really connecting, and totally at a loss for navigating how to handle my brother. Yet the brother, my grandfather, and my aunts and uncles project a strong sense of ""you're obligated to be with them just as much as a regular sibling"". I only hear from my grandpa if it's asking when I can pick them up and do something fun with them. 

I don't know. This is a super long vent but I just feel chained to them on so many levels. ",6,1744652539.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,1.0,False

1jz4xi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jz4xi0/the_quiet_house_on_witch_hazel_lane/,The Quiet House on Witch Hazel Lane,"An odd serenity often lingers in the air in the wake of violence. Morbid as it may be, I have always found peace in the various ambient sounds present at such scenes and learned to appreciate the poetic absurdity of their persistence. The sound of a trickling faucet left running by a woman now dead on the kitchen floor, the hollow tones of a wind chime hung from a rafter just as its owner had done to himself -- near flawless juxtapositions that might have drawn the envy of the Old Masters themselves had they witnessed them. Fittingly, just as an artist might use different shades for aesthetic means, they are not only useful for that purpose but can be used to tell a story, to draw focus to an overarching theme that could not be easily gleaned without their consideration.

Of the countless scenes I have been called to over the years, there was one where this rule did not apply.

My phone rang around 11:40 pm that night. Sergeant Nichols had been flagged down by a group of three shaken boys who reported that they had found a body in the abandoned house on Witch Hazel Ln. The youngest of the three had been dared to go into the residence and wave at the remaining two from a second-story window. Once on the second floor, he found the body and ran down to tell his pals. The boys were taken to the station and their parents were called in order to obtain statements while Nichols and three others went to the address where they found a decomposing body in one of the second-story closets.

Hanging up the phone, I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and put on a pot of coffee while I dressed for what would likely be a long night.

The gravel drive was fairly short, but it wound through the trees in such a manner that it seemed much longer than it was. At the end rose a decrepit, two-story home that had been long since abandoned. It was surrounded by ancient oaks constricted by vines that intertwined, obstructing any view of the property from beyond the perimeter. The front of the structure was fitted with a sagging and rotten porch whose roof bore much of the same qualities, while unintelligible graffiti adorned the exterior in places, accentuating the chipping paint, broken windows, and all other derelict qualities of the once beautiful home. The only sources of illumination that night emitted from the headlights and rotating blues of the patrol cars, which had carried Nichols and the others to the scene earlier that evening.

I exited my car, placing my flashlight in the back pocket of my pants, and hung my camera around my neck before approaching the trio. The two younger officers appeared a bit shaken, which was to be expected, but it was the unease I detected on Nichols' grizzled face that gave me some concern. Nicholes was a seasoned veteran who had responded to some of the more gruesome scenes I had been a part of and never showed an ounce of trepidation. Telling the others to remain at the cars, Nicholes motioned for me to follow him to the front of the residence as he glanced at the half-open front door.

""Something's not right here, Teddy..."" he said once we were out of earshot of the patrolmen.

""Foul play?"" I asked with an inquisitive look.

""Dunno... It's something about this place. It's like it plays tricks with you.""

I let out a breathy chuckle. ""Halloween was two weeks ago, Nicholes. Maybe it's a case of residual spooks?""

He didn't laugh.

""I'm not playin' around here, Teddy. Something's off. Not sure how to explain it, but..."" he trailed off seeming to try and form a coherent explanation.

Confusion and concern were what I was feeling at the moment but the combination of the two states must have manifested themselves in an impatient or mocking expression.

""... You think this is fuckin' funny?"" Nicholes snapped.

""Easy... Alright, I'll cut the shit."" I said raising my hands in surrender. I nodded to the door. ""Let's take a look.""

Removing the flashlight from my pocket, I clicked it on, trained the amber beam at the doorway, and began to make my way toward it, Nicholes hesitantly trailing behind.

I didn't expect there to be any overt noises in such a house given its abandoned state, but one would imagine the sounds of creaking floors or rafters, or the faint sounds of rats clawing about in the walls, but there was nothing. Once I crossed the threshold, the sounds of the officer's radios and the persistent chirping of crickets ceased as though the door had been closed behind me. I looked back to see Nicholes standing on the front porch just on the other side of the open door, trying and failing to mask his dread. I shot him a quick smile and motioned with my head for him to come in. After a moment and a deep breath, he joined me in the silence.

It was an oppressive quietness. My ears were popping and began to ring as I stepped further into the foyer. If I hadn't seen Nicholes step in behind me, I would not have known he was there. We stood still a moment while I listened intently for anything, but the only new sound I detected was the faint thumping of my heart and the unsettling whooshing sound of the blood it was pushing through my veins with progressive intensity.

""See what I mean?"" came what seemed like a whisper from behind me.

Nicholes moved to my side as we looked around.

""Is this place soundproofed?"" I asked, half startled by the relative volume of my own voice resonating in my skull.

""Not that I can tell. Even if it were, you'd think those broken windows would let somethin' in.""

I moved my light towards the windows in the adjoined living room to see nearly all of them had been shattered at one point or another.

""This isn't even the half of it..."" he said, pointing his light to the wooden staircase ahead.

Wondering what could possibly be stranger than the silence, I made my way to the staircase and began my absurdly quiet ascent. The stairs were old but mostly intact. I could feel the old boards flexing under my weight but, now expectedly, there was no groaning of wood against wood. I stopped halfway up the stairs upon noticing the absence of something else.

""Didn't you say the body was in decomp?"" I asked.

""What?"" Nicholes responded in what seemed like a whisper.

I turned to face him ""Decomp. Didn't you say the body was in decomp? I don't smell shit.""

""Yeah, noticed that too.""

Once we were at the second-floor landing, I moved my light to the left down the hallway to see several doors in varying states of openness and a few small piles of refuse left by trespassers. Looking to the right, I saw it several feet from the top of the stairs -- leaning against the wall in a sitting position was the subject of my being in that strange home. The skin had begun to turn a brownish black, the hair on its head was beginning to sluff off, and it wasn't as bloated as I thought it should be, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Although its features were not very evident, I could tell by its lack of clothing that it was most definitely the body of a male. I set my flashlight on the banister ensuring the beam remained trained on the body, raised my camera, and snapped a photo of the gruesome scene.

I saw Nicholes's light coalesce with mine and I turned to ask a question.

""Fuck me..."" he said, all of the color drained from his face.

I looked at the body and then back to Nicholes.

""You told me on the phone that he was in a closet,"" I said in a near-scolding tone.

He stood silent, light and eyes trained on the rotting corpse.

""If you're about to tell me --""

""It was, Ted. It fucking was.""

""Was? What do you mean it 'was'?""

""I mean it was in the closet two doors down on the left from the stairs when I last fuckin' saw it..."" he said, panic now rising in his voice.

I shined my light to the left to see the closet door standing open. Scanning the dirty, wooden floor between it and the body, I saw a damp trail leading between the two. I drew my pistol.

""Nicholes, did you and your boys clear th --""

""Yes, we cleared the fuckin' house, Teddy! No one's here and no one's come in.""

""Unless one of you moved it, we have someone else in here!"" I snapped, now scanning each doorway for movement.

""I'll hold here. You go get the others and clear the first floor. Meet me back here once you're done."" I said without looking, Nicholes's light moving from the body being the only confirmation he had heard me.

""Get a few other units out here to set up a perimeter too!"" I yelled, the internal volume hurting my ears. I wasn't sure he had heard me but I didn't want to turn and check.

I had been in hairy situations before but this was most definitely the strangest. I scanned left and right again, half expecting to see a head poking out from one of the rooms. Sensing that I needed to calm down, I took a few deep breaths and moved my light back to the corpse. I knew that I had a few minutes before the three patrolmen cleared the first floor and made it back to me, so I decided to use that time to try and deduce the location of our intruder. Looking at the floor in front of each doorway I couldn't see any sign of recent disturbance save for the boot prints from the patrolmen's boots and damp drag marks consisting of a reddish-yellow fluid. Surprisingly, the second-story windows were all mostly intact with a few sporting various cracks and chips from decades of neglect. All of them were closed, however, and appeared to have been so for some time given the cobwebs and dust built up around the edges. Unless there was a way off of the second story from inside one of the rooms, someone had to be up there with me. I looked at the body, specifically the arms and legs. If someone had drug it from its previous location, the desiccated skin would be torn by the pressure but, from my position, I couldn't tell if that were the case. From what I could see, there wasn't a rug, blanket, or any other item that could have been used to pull it along the floor either. The cadaver was sitting on the floor with nothing underneath it, rotting flesh to hardwood.

Minutes passed as I stood at the top of the stairs. The relatively light weight of my pistol and light seemed to increase as my arms and shoulders began to tire. I couldn't hear where the patrolmen were in the house or if they were inside at all. Despite how scared he may have been, I knew Nicholes would be back inside as quickly as he could. It was the younger men I feared might refuse to come back inside if they knew what had transpired. Another two minutes passed and I spared a look behind me. No sound as I expected, but no lights either. The thought crossed my mind that the sicko had made it down to the first floor at some point and Nicholes and his men were needing help.

Checking both ends of the hallway one last time, I backed down the stairs, keeping an eye on the landing. Still no noise. I took each step carefully as to not fall, keeping one foot planted firm on one step and sliding the other down to the next. I kept waiting to hear the sounds of a scuffle or gunshots but heard nothing but my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I took a few more steps, feeling that I should be close to the bottom, and turned my head to look behind me. Nicholes and the other two officers stood at the bottom of the stairs, guns and lights in hand.

""Jesus!"" I exclaimed, startled by their appearance behind me. ""Where the fuck have you been?""

""We found some more rooms towards the back here that we hadn't checked yet. Took us a bit longer. Any signs up there?""

""Nah, no signs. It was just me and John fucking Doe up there catching up. Let's go clear the second floor."" I said, more than a bit agitated.

The four of us made our way back up the stairs, myself at point. With backup behind me, I felt a bit braver and took the steps much quicker than I had before. I had hoped that by my leaving and the absence of noise of our return, we would catch the bastard trying to move the body again. Approaching the final steps before coming back into view of the body, I slowed my pace, steadied my breath, and prepared for a fight. I felt a hand on my shoulder, reassuring me I wouldn't be in it alone. As my head broke the threshold, I shined my light into the hallway.

The corpse was gone.

""Fuck!"" I exclaimed, rushing onto the landing and looking down both ends of the hallway.

All at once, the sound returned like a tidal wave. Footsteps sounded like thunder, and the creaking of the floorboards sounded as though the house was about to give way. I looked around to see Nicholes and the other officers now on the landing and shining their lights wildly around the area.

Nicholes and I took the right side of the hallway, and the other two took the left. We cleared each room and closet, nook, and cranny. Nothing.

Additional officers arrived on the scene and searched the house as thoroughly as possible. Aside from trash and debris, we found absolutely nothing.

There was a brief internal investigation into all of us who were at the scene that night. We were subjected to interviews, polygraph examinations, and psychological evaluations before we were cleared to return to regular duties. It seemed ridiculous to me that they would even think that any of us would or could have hidden or destroyed that body, but, in all fairness, what other explanation could there be? If it weren't for the picture I took of the damn thing, they might have thought we were experiencing a mass delusion or under the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. I wonder if there wasn't anything of the sort going on at that time. I mean, no sound? No smell? Did someone or something take the corpse and get away?

One of the younger officers from that night decided to quit after the internal investigation concluded, and I don't blame him. I stayed with it, though and have been working the case since but I've found absolutely no leads. I plan on returning to Witch Hazel Lane in the near future.

I wanted to share something that happened and get some advice or perspective.

I was taking care of a patient, lung transplant, kidney transplant, diabetic, with glucose all over the place (sometimes 340 at night, 100 in the morning). He was going to be NPO at midnight for a bronchoscopy scheduled for today.

Yesterday, the APRN increased his nightly NPH insulin from 6 units to 10 units. I was running late, and when I went to give the 10 units of NPH around 9:50 PM, Epic gave me a warning that the patient was marked NPO. It asked me to override if I still wanted to give it. I backed up, re read the parameters, and saw it said “give half the insulin dose if patient is NPO.”
Even though technically the patient wasn’t NPO yet (it was 9:50 PM), he wasn’t eating after 9 PM, and I got nervous. I didn’t want to override without thinking it through because insulin scares me, especially in this super unstable patient. I ended up giving 5 units (half the dose).

Today morning during shift change, the APRN put the whole nursing team in the Epic patient chat and asked, “Who gave the half the insulin dose yesterday? That was silly.” He said I should have used “critical thinking” and called the doctor to clarify instead of just adjusting the dose.

I didn’t want to argue on the Epic chat, so I just explained briefly that I didn’t want to override Epic warning. Later, I emailed the APRN, apologized, and said that next time I would try to be more confident in overriding Epic warnings. I know not every Epic warning is a stop sign, but insulin genuinely makes me anxious because of the risks.

My manager told me, “Every situation is different. You have to use your gut.”
And honestly, my gut said to be cautious with this patient. His glucose swings wildly. One time he went from 340 to 96 overnight. Three days ago his house was 340, I called the doctor he ordered 7units when I went to his room he was drinking a Starbucks ice coffee and his wife told me, I gave him 13 units. I notified the doctor I didn’t give the 7 units because his wife gave 13u insteady. 



I’m trying to learn from this. I get that I should have called to clarify. I just didn’t feel confident enough in that moment.

Any advice? How do you build that confidence to override when appropriate, especially with insulin? 

Thanks for reading.

Not posting on bad roommates because it isn’t a current issue. 
I’m going to break this story down in a sequence of events otherwise it would be a novel. Very curious to know if anyone else went through something similar. 


I was 21F and roommate was 20F. I didn’t know her outside of class in highschool but she always seemed super nice. I was working 3 jobs so she decided to look at places for us. 


- we sign lease and move in to first place, it’s $875 a month. I move my stuff in and 3 days later get a random text from her dad, who I hadn’t met or spoken to up until this point, saying he got us out of the lease and was moving our stuff to a friends garage for the time being. The reasoning was that the apartment had “code violations.” What he actually did was bully the landlord into breaking the lease and not returning our deposit. He simply didn’t approve of a shitty apartment. However, he lied to me at this point and said he got the deposit back. He wrote me a check from his personal account. 


- I freak out because we can’t find any other affordable places and I didn’t have a place to go. She still had a comfy spot with her dad. He finds us a place for $950 and says he’ll put the utility bill in his name and pay that for us to make up the difference in price from the last place. I’m not really okay with it but was out of options. 


- We move into this new place and everything is fine for about 2 weeks. My roommate was out of work on unemployment and was milking the fuck out of it, I was working 3 jobs still and commuting an hour for one. I was also in a very toxic relationship. My roommate was mid spiral from a breakup. We were both in bad places. We were hanging out too often and I noticed little ways in which she’d drop her nice facade. The more I got to know her the more it read like narcissism. She had nothing nice to say about any of the people she introduced me to. She took over conversation when we were out together or had company. She’d break things around the apartment just being careless. Would do some sort of stomping exercise indoors that our downstairs neighbor repeatedly complained about. She’d smoke weed inside despite having a nosy and strict landlord. The list goes on. 


- The next issue is her dads involvement. He inserted himself into my life, too. He let himself into the apartment on several occasions because my roommate gave him a key, even after i explicitly asked her not to. He took it upon himself to paint an accent wall, throw out one of my chairs, and paint my hard wood antique coffee table. He even took my laundry and did it for me when I asked him not to and to not enter my room. Roommate claims up and down she’s doing nothing to enable this behavior but I start to become suspicious the more intrusive he gets. 


- She injected herself into my life and kind of preyed on the fact I was in a vulnerable place. It was like she had a hero complex. She’d ask me how I was doing and would therapy speak me often. It’s hard to explain but it’s the same vibe you get from a hippie on drugs at a music festival when they walk up and grab your face and say they can see your inner child. You know?? Like grabbing my hand, talking in a soft voice, preaching about self care and shit. Just really putting on this front that she’s a safe person, very manipulative. So I confide in her often. 


- I start to get more and more uneasy with her weird behavior. We go out together and she spills my drink and doesn’t even bat an eye. Actually fully walks away. We go to a party together where I don’t know anyone and she leaves me alone as soon as we walk in. The other things I already mentioned. She even once took my seat and took over my bluetooth when we had company because I got up to pre. One day, I confront her about her weird self centered behavior and how it’s making me feel really shitty on top of the 3 jobs and crappy boyfriend. I said she wasn’t being a great friend and she decides to leave the apartment.


- I go off on her about how shitty it is to just leave to her parents because we are having a conflict. I tell her that she has an obligation to me as my roommate and cannot just disappear a week before rent is due. This is the part where I definitely was acting like an asshole, but I was reacting out of paranoia as I knew what the plan was the minute she left. I blew her up for two days before i decided to call her dad directly. She ignored probably 50 texts. I was definitely crashing out but given they’d already gotten me kicked out of one place - I was scared. 


- Important to note - dad was also clearly a raging narcissist. Apple doesn’t fall far. I call him after roommate hasn’t answered me for 3 days and rent is now due in 4 days. He answers the phone in a sing songy “i’m grinning ear to ear to fake a happy tone” kind of voice. Gaslights me about my concerns of my roommates radio silence days before rent is due. I keep pushing because he keeps deflecting and trying to put it on me, acting like I’m worried about nothing. He then snaps and blows up on me about how I am “mentally insane” and “bad for his daughter” and he wanted us out of the apartment in 24 hours. I hung up. 
- 
- 
- 
- I call the landlord and explain the situation. She says I can either stay on the lease alone, find another roommate, or leave and just lose my deposit. She was pretty sympathetic and I understood that was the best she could offer. We’d only been there a month for fucks sake. So I entertain the idea of a roommate for about a day and ditch it. I decide to find another place and end up renting it in time. $850 two bed at the beach and I was moving in with one of the chillest dudes I knew. Felt like the calm after the storm. 


- Moving out was of course not simple. The dad tried to spin it on me. A day before rent was due he texted me saying since my roommates unemployment was ending suddenly (? lol) she wouldn’t be able to pay rent. I told him that, per our last conversation, I was well aware she intended to move out and already made my arrangements. He then tried to use this as some kinda admission of blame for the move out. Saying I initiated it so I should be solely financially responsible. I kinda just ignored it because she had the same options I did, so the claims that she “had” to move out because I “told the landlord she wanted to” were such nonsense they weren’t worth entertaining. 



- I move out and the drama is over. I’m living my life. Two months later, I get a text from the landlord that she sent me part of our deposit back. But the check had to be cashed by both of us. I emailed my ex roommate, as she was blocked in my phone, and told her the days and times I was available to meet at the bank. I get an extortion email back in response from her father. It details every expense he feels I owe them reimbursement for. Again, because “I” told the landlord that “she” wanted to move when she allegedly had every intention to stay. Bullshit. He claims I owe them for all kinds of things. Including the initial deposit he gave me out of his own account after forcefully removing my items from a property I signed a lease for without my permission. He wanted me to pay for her uhaul, the entire utilities bill, her application fees, her side of the deposit (no, not meet at the bank to cash the existing check, just pay it out of my own pocket), amongst other ridiculous things. He includes a long winded personal letter about how he and his family “did so much for me” and how he feels “so used.” He states they have lawyers in the family and will sue if I don’t send him what amounted to $2000. At the bottom of this email was also a letter from my roommate that was equally as ridiculous stating how much she was “there” for me and feels betrayed. 




The end of the story is that I ignored them. I knew they had no leg to stand on and if they wanted to take me to court they’d lose. I went about my life and heard through the grapevine that my ex roommate is going around telling people I traumatized her and was an abuser. Mind you - over one argument. I was in a notably shitty place at the time and it was really awful to experience someone pretending to be there for you later using everything you confided in them about against you. She claimed I emotionally abused her. She claimed I put her at risk having my crap boyfriend over when he was not physically abusive. Just an asshole with a cheating problem. Only risk he posed was to me. She also claimed she tried to “save me” from him but I wouldn’t let her. Again, no one asked her to insert herself that hard. 


It was also shitty because all we had to do was have a conversation. We could’ve tabled it for another time, but she didn’t need to run off. Even if she decided to run off she could’ve given me a heads up and assured me it was just temporary. We could’ve decided to be adults about it and move out a month later, as our lease specified to get our deposit back. It was month to month. But she took the most petty and selfish route possible. Still, it is what is is. My life got a lot better after that. 


To this day one of the wildest things I’ve ever experienced and I’m amazed I survived it so well. Really impressive what you’re capable of in a survival situation lol.

He’s technically second in command now, which is hilarious, because nothing about this man screams “authority.”

The first time I heard him speak, I honestly thought it was a joke. Like, full-on valley girl voice—high-pitched, exaggerated, every sentence dripping with vocal fry and sounding like it ends in a question. At first, I thought, “Okay, he’s being silly, whatever.” Nope. That’s just how he talks.

Now let me be clear—I have zero issues with valley accents. I’ve been around people who talk like that and I don’t bat an eye. But Mickey’s voice? It grates. It’s the way he uses it that gets me. Every sentence sounds sarcastic, like he’s mocking you mid-conversation. He’ll come up to talk business—about serious tasks that affect the store—and I can’t even focus because it sounds like he’s narrating a reality show.

But hey, voice aside, you’d think a manager—especially one trying to be taken seriously—would at least look the part. Right? Wrong.

It’s like this man shows up in the same tired pair of skinny jeans every single day. Skinny. Like vacuum-sealed tight. Paired with a plain white T-shirt, not even a button-down, just the kind of shirt you’d wear to bed or under a hoodie. And on top of that? A sports coat that looks like it got lost on its way to a different outfit. It doesn’t go. It doesn’t match. It just… exists. You ever see someone dressed like they’re in a Target catalog from 2012? That’s Mickey. Except less styled, more confused. It’s giving: “first day of work at an off-brand tech startup,” but make it retail.

He’s got the audacity to lecture us—the department actually keeping things together—about how we’re in a “rich community” and need to dress the store up to match the clientele. Meanwhile, we’re out here in slacks, button-downs, and suit jackets, looking like we’re heading to a business conference, and he looks like he’s hosting open mic night at a coffee shop.

To make it worse, he once gave me a dirty look for absolutely no reason. Like sir, please—you look like you borrowed your little brother’s jeans and threw on a thrifted blazer last minute. Like, you’re gonna look me up and down while you look like a human clearance rack? Okay. Maybe don’t when your outfit screams “Retail: The Parody.”

I want to take him seriously, I really do. But every time he opens his mouth or walks past me in that plain T-shirt and wannabe power blazer, my soul quietly exits my body.

Retail’s hard enough. I don’t need Mickey adding an unintentional comedy routine on top of it.

It’s giving: “I’m interviewing for a job at Best Buy but I also might DJ at a dive bar after this.”
It’s giving: “I want to look important but my laundry day said ‘not today.’”

1jz4n8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/1jz4n8t/stuck_at_139_wait_for_the_whoosh_or_just_crack/,stuck at 139; wait for the whoosh or just crack down? (i know i know...),"i'm 37, 5'2"", and currently stuck at 139 down from probably 155-160 (though i'm not entirely sure) last fall. the bulk of the loss happened between january and early march, when i hit 139 for the first time. 

my last, post-period weigh-in was yet again 139.5. i'm going out of my mind. i think my NEAT kind of leveled off due to work and stress and the relapse from spring into second winter, but **i'm maintaining 139.5 at the following routine:** 

\-1400-1600 calories per day. TDEE calc puts my maintenance calories at \~1900.   
\-8-10K steps per day, sometimes more, sometimes less, but my average across the last couple months is roughly 10k/day   
\-4 days weightlifting in progressive overload per week, following an upper/lower body split hypertrophy program; my lifts have stayed consistent or improved across the board.   
\-my steady state/HIIT cardio has been a little more limited, either running or spinning, again, sometimes SS sometimes HIIT, but mostly 1-2 days per week because i've been focused on straight step count and getting my lifts in. if there's a place to increase activity, it seems like i could trade out some of my walk time for more intense cardio, but i'm kind of topping out on my energy and time constraints with work and working out.   
\-salsa classes one hour/week + dancing on the weekends ;) i don't drink. 

my waist measurement stays steady at around 29 inches, sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on bloating and menstruation. i feel like sometimes i look so shredded, but then i take my measurement or step on the scale and nothing changes. 

i did take a 2-week break from mid-march to the start of april because i was already plateauing and i just needed a mental break from the deficit. but i stayed consistent on my workouts and i still can't get the scale to tick downward. 

**potential problems i can see:**   
\-not weighing every single thing. i have done this long enough (more than the just the current moment), so i will eyeball some foods or use cup measurements instead of throwing things on the scale. maybe this is fucking me up? i measure out oil and i do track everything, even if i go to the higher end of my deficit.   
\-not doing enough higher/high intensity cardio   
\-needing to increase NEAT across the day; i do sit at my computer for work and while i try to get up enough, maybe i need to really hustle to get these last pounds of fat off? i don't want to spend $ for a walking pad because i'm not good at moving and typing and i frequently leave the house to work in coffee shops and libraries, so it's like... eh, not my bag.   
\-stress........? :| 

the high 130s are such a hobgoblin for me. i've always been muscular, and that's great, but i can see very clearly that i have fat to cut, and i want to cut it and actually see the muscle that's underneath. i know this is impossible to diagnose over reddit, but i'm wondering if anyone has a similar experience and if, based on your experiences, you would suggest sticking with the same deficit, increasing cardio more aggressively or something else. i do feel fine just staying the course and slowly recomping or whatever, but i don't want to lose out on potential fat loss by going back to maintenance calories. but if i can't progress past this point, i don't want to mentally burn out in the deficit, either. 

if you have any inspiration, motivation, relevant experience, or anything else, i'd love to hear it. 

**if you want to tell me to forget about the scale/not worry about the number, i hear you, i see you, but just save yourself the typing time and skip the comment. i'm using scale/waist measurement as my tools and i don't care about ""not worrying about the scale."" 😘**  i say this with love and all the body neutrality in the world!

# Key Features

# 1. Odor Control

* **Subjective Winner**: [PetSafe ScoopFree Crystal Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WZPJ2LW?tag=gadgetcompare-20). Its crystal litter is a standout, sucking up urine and drying waste fast. My living room stayed fresh even with my cat’s notorious stinkers.
* **Analysis**: Crystal litter edges out clumping options for odor neutralization, but the app-controlled models offer deodorizing extras. [Cumrige](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM4Z71X?tag=gadgetcompare-20) and [BCHARYA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4DFYB71?tag=gadgetcompare-20) shine with built-in systems, though user reviews show mixed results.

**Personal Take**: I adore [PetSafe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WZPJ2LW?tag=gadgetcompare-20) for its simplicity, but [Cumrige](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM4Z71X?tag=gadgetcompare-20)’s fragrance box could be a lifesaver during a heatwave.

# 2. Ease of Maintenance

* **Subjective Winner**: [PetPivot Autoscooper 11 (White)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRC7Y76D?tag=gadgetcompare-20). No app or special litter—just plug it in, and it works. Cleaning the bin is a breeze with included bags.
* **Analysis**: [PetSafe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WZPJ2LW?tag=gadgetcompare-20) excels with disposable trays, but you’re locked into their system. App models like [Cumrige](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM4Z71X?tag=gadgetcompare-20) add complexity but save time for frequent travelers.

**Personal Take**: I’d pick [PetPivot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRC7Y76D?tag=gadgetcompare-20) for its no-nonsense approach, though [PetSafe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WZPJ2LW?tag=gadgetcompare-20)’s tray swaps are tempting when I’m lazy.

# 3. Safety Features

* **Subjective Winner**: [BCHARYA Self Cleaning Cat Litter Box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4DFYB71?tag=gadgetcompare-20). Its sensors and delay mechanism feel like a safety net for my curious kitten.
* **Analysis**: Open-top designs like [PetPivot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRC7Y76D?tag=gadgetcompare-20) and [Autoscooper](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT9CDD8W?tag=gadgetcompare-20) reduce entrapment risks, but enclosed models with sensors win for active cats.

**Personal Take**: [BCHARYA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4DFYB71?tag=gadgetcompare-20) feels safest, but I wish [PetSafe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WZPJ2LW?tag=gadgetcompare-20) had an open-top option for extra reassurance.

# 4. Capacity for Multiple Cats

* **Subjective Winner**: [Cumrige Self Cleaning Litter Box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM4Z71X?tag=gadgetcompare-20). Its 95L roller and 15L bin handled my friend’s three-cat chaos like a champ.

We're desperate for answers and guidance (using AI to summarize due to length):

**Demographics:** 23-year-old female, anemic (taking iron supplements)

**Medications:** Gabapentin, Methocarbamol as needed, Lidocaine patches, Methylprednisone depot (DEPO-MEDROL) injection in upper right quadrant of glute helps relieve symptoms for a few weeks

**Main symptoms during episodes (last \~45 minutes each):**

* Complete or near inability to move
* Eye flickering/twitching and facial twitching
* Involuntary hand gripping/clenching
* Speech difficulties (stuttering, repeating words)
* Right leg becomes completely non-functional (""as if cut off"") - can't bend it
* Numbness/tingling in right foot/toes
* Sometimes experiences urinary incontinence during episodes (important?)
* After episodes end, she feels tired and dizzy

**Pain description:**

* Severe lower right back pain
* ""Magnet in lower back"" sensation
* ""Pulsing in ovaries"" feeling
* Tailbone pain ""like falling hard on tailbone""
* Pain in lower right abdominal/ovary area
* Interestingly, she often doesn't feel the pain until AFTER the neurological episode resolves

**Episode pattern:**

* Can happen multiple times per day or as infrequently as once per month
* If she has one episode, she'll likely have multiple that same day and in the next morning/day too
* Between episodes, she's completely normal with no symptoms
* We have multiple videos documenting these episodes

**Known triggers:**

* ""Intimate"" physical activity involving extended movement (I apologize for crudeness, simply a fact unfortunately)
* Sitting in certain chairs (especially bar-stool type seats)
* Car rides (though inconsistent)
* Straightening legs and lifting her head helps resolve symptoms (sometimes)
* Moving to a couch/different position helps

**Medical evaluations so far:**

* Multiple ER visits - no diagnosis, discharged when symptoms resolved
* Brain MRI - normal
* Ovarian ultrasound - normal, no cysts
* Appendix removed (did not resolve symptoms)
* Insurance keeps denying spine MRI requests
* One non-specialist doctor suggested possible cauda equina syndrome (possibly due to urinary incontinence (sometimes/rarely during episode))

**Recent developments (today):**

* Woke with severe lower right back pain and twitching
* Took Gabapentin at 8:40 AM
* Also took magnesium and iron supplements
* Started shaking again at work around 11:15 AM
* Yesterday had multiple episodes (after ""physical activity"" at noon, at coffee shop at 6 PM (resolved by moving from bar stool to couch at coffee shop), and after car ride (10 minutes long) at 10 PM taking gf home, walking her up her stairs, inside her house)

Her chiropractor told us that the urinary incontinence during episodes is especially concerning and warrants an immediate ER visit.

**Questions:**

1. Could this be cauda equina syndrome despite the episodic nature and full recovery between episodes?
2. What could explain the combination of lower back/right-sided pain with the widespread neurological symptoms affecting speech, facial muscles, and hand control?
3. What specific tests or imaging should we be advocating for?
4. How concerning is the urinary incontinence during episodes?
5. Should she go to the ER immediately given today's symptoms?

We're at our wits' end with doctors dismissing her when symptoms resolve. Any guidance would be deeply appreciated. We've been to 8 different hospital ER's, admitted twice, she had a kidney infection one of the times 8 months ago, and allegedly had appendicitis and had an appendectomy 10 months ago, but none of these things resolved her issues and she continued to have episodes and pain in the lower right quadrant.",1,1744651046.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

 A few disclaimers, sorry for any formatting errors. Due to me doing this on mobile all images have to be in slideshow format and will follow the post in order Also I wanna say thanks to all the homies hearing me out on this over the last couple of months and bullying Me (with love) into finally getting this completed. You've been warned, this is a long read an there will be no TLDR. All of this was found during an attempt to dissect Lyrics which led to some fantastic connections, I'm going to attempt line all the key players I have found so far to be working together to bring a greater truth to the general public, an effort that spans over  the last 13 years (at least) and involves efforts by artist across genres and mediums. What they are leading us to I can't be sure, but I can say (with a fair amount of confidence) is that these common themes are not coincidences.

1. WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD

Here is a link to my previous post The BIG picture part 1

https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/s/CiRoodKLC4

In the begginning I made a point to say that it's important to look at Drake as being the mask that needs to be taken off, in order to expose the concerning systems pulling the strings. At the time I had no idea how on the nose that statement would be. 

And here's why, when researching Drskes plane Air Drake I noticed that it had been redesigned by the late great designer Virgil Abloh in 2020

https://www.designboom.com/design/virgil-abloh-customizes-drake-boeing-private-jet-white-clouds-03-30-2020/

The first thing that caught my eye was this design on one the wings
 
PICTURE 1

The mask felt very on the nose so I decided to look more into Virgil as I honestly knew very little about him but knew he was behind the design for the Mercedes Maybach used in Drakes Sticky music video.

 PICTURE 2

https://robbreport.com/motors/cars/drake-virgil-ablohs-mercedes-maybach-concept-1234733679/

This was done by virgils brand off-white which had some thinking it may have to do with the glove in the cover art for 6:16 in LA

PICTURE 3

So I did some more digging and discovered what I believe points straight to Virgil and his connections to Drake

I believe he is key to the Off-White Sunseeker at the Marina

Off-white being Virgils brand

Sunseeker which is a visual album by Tyler the Creator in 2022 for Louis Vuitton creatively directed by Virgil Abloh before his passing in 2021

https://youtu.be/XKXX0BFDmPI?si=1vm0hzGNLNyq0sqo

I highly encourage watching because there are so many layers in this as well

At the Marina

Virgils send off show after his passing was held  in miami at the Maritime Marina in 2021

https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2021/12/01/virgil-ablohs-artistic-genius-takes-over-the-miami-marine-stadium/#:~:text=MIAMI%20%E2%80%93%20Virgil%20Abloh's%20genius%20took%20over,Badu%20were%20among%20the%20celebrities%20in%20attendance.

Virgil even redesigned the logo for a Yacht dubbed ""Scott free"" before his passing

https://www.superyachttimes.com/yacht-news/virgil-abloh-rebranded-60m-yacht-scott-free

""I like to buy yachts when I get the fever??""

Okay so this all could be a stretch right? right?!?

How close were Virgil and Drake anyway?

Well.. close enough for Drake to have a monument of Virgil during his it's all a blur tour and to get a tattoo of the same monument

PICTURES 4 & 5

https://pagesix.com/2021/12/23/drake-honors-late-virgil-abloh-with-new-tattoo/


Before Virgils passing he also designed a pair of matching emerald encrusted Phillipe Patek watches for he and drake

PICTURE 6

https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/drake-virgil-abloh-patek-philippe-watch/

When Good Credit dropped this immediately came to mind

PICTURE 7

Also funny because honestly this does imply Kendrick is calling the boy a bitch by saying the emerald cuffs for his and hers


But the patek is flooded?!?

Interestingly the killer researcher u/War-General-NLU found that this watch is now in fact for sale

https://centerluxury.vn/patek-philippe-nautilus-5726-1a-001-40mm-green-gemstone-dial/

https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkKenny/s/es6lzRkRAw

Also sidebar and not necessarily important but interesting to note, at one time it appears Patek and made a clock/wiretapping device

https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/behold-the-patek-philippe-wiretapping-device-that-just-sold-at-antiquorum-geneva

Okay so obviously Virgil and Drake had a pretty close working relationship but why does Kendrick care??

Well I found that not only did Kendrick wear a suit designed by Virgil duringnhis first super bowl performance but also one of the first Louis Vuitton show since Virgils passing was performed by none other than Mr Morale himself.

https://www.gq.com/story/kendrick-lamar-louis-vuitton-paris-fashion-week-virgil-abloh

""Lamar performed an orchestral-backed medley of tracks from his latest album, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, including “N95,” as well as “Savior,” “Rich Spirit” and “Count Me Out,” closing out the rendition with a repeated mantra of “Long live Virgil.”""

Seems like those songs choice were very intentional.. Virgil putting a mask on Air Drake.. N95 which we all know is full of Drake references annnd an entendre for an N95 mask.. 

But wait this is where it become interesting

""As Lamar soundtracked the show’s finale, models carried a huge rainbow banner down the runway, which resembled a looping roller coaster of a yellow brick road. (Abloh’s earliest Vuitton collections paid homage to The Wizard of Oz and The Wiz.) In Abloh’s stead, the entire LV men’s team eased on down the yellow runway to close out the show.""

The yellow brick road.. wizard of oz...

Where else have I seen these references??

The begginning sample on Euphoria is  from the Wiz with Richard Pryor's ""Everything they say about me is true"" with Richard Pryor himself being cast as the Wiz

(Quick sidebar, Nipsey Russell played the tin man in the Wiz and later on inspired Nipsey Hussels stage name)

We also have the infamous Squabble up belt pins..


Are we still in Kansas?
 
PICTURE 8

Follow the yellow brick road

For those of you that may not be familiar with the movie or story of the Wizard of Oz. It follows the story of Dorothy a young girl in the gray prairies of Kansas who is picked up by a great cyclone (Tornado) and transported in the magically colorful land of oz. The movie most of us know was the first movie to introduce technicolor to film as we know it with the transition happening as steps out of the door of her sepia tone home and into the vibrant land of oz. She kills the wicked witch of the north due to her house landing on the witch and is given the witches magic slippers as a thank you for saving the munchkins of oz. She's seeks the way home and is told to follow the yellow brick road to the wizard of oz in the emerald city so he may grant her wish. With her loyal dog Toto in arm she sets of and meets her friends the scarecrow, the tinman and the lion along the way who also seek things from the wizard such as a brain, a heart and courage, but once they arrive and after defeating the wicked witch of the west they find the great wizard is nothing but a phony. But alas grants their wishes and dorothy si transported home on a hot air balloon.. in the book the great wizard shares that before coming to oz he was a famous balloonist..

Ballonists do it better?

Now I'm curious about Virgil and the wizard of oz because there seem to be a lot of overlap here.. such as the Emerald faced watch thay Virgil designed for drake..
Face of a watch.. mask??

Here is a look at some of his work prior to his death

PICTURE 11

In the movie and the books one of the obstacle dorothy and crew face just before reaching the emerald city was a vast field of magical poppy's that basically drugged them and made them fall asleep forgetting all about their journey until they are pulled out of the fields.. which also made me think of the red flowers and perfume in blink twice.. but we will get to that

""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain"" 

Which is what the great wizard states when they discover he is not the great image of oz that he projected but is actually just a man behind the curtain pretending..

Hmm sound familiar??

In the word of Tyler... I hope you take your mask offffff

Also of important note is in the send off show for Virgil in miami was the giant hot air balloon in the back ground with Virgils monument holding what appears to be a door.. like the door dorothy entered??

PICTURE 13

If you're interested I highly encourage taking a look at virgils websites and initiatives.. they honestly have the same type of vibes as File Systems of Coffee and pgLang and would definitely recommend poking around to see what things you might find in the code even.. even steg possibly as researched by team deeper picture u/rabbitholegoesdeeper with 6:16 in LA 

https://virgilabloh.com/

Specifically on the website free game all the way at the bottom I noticed an interview with none other than MFDOOM

PICTURE 14

What makes this inetresting is the fact that not inly is the website eeirly similar to file systems of coffee which has ties to Donald glover (please see linked post above to part one for full context)
 
But Donalds glovers show Atlanta had an episode in season 4 episode one where Paperboi was led on a scaevenger hunt thru bkue bloods music to bluebloods funeral. Donald mentioned in articles the episode was a tribute to MFDOOM and the puzzles and scavenger hunts he was also known for but upon rewatching i felt like this couldve have described virgil too.

Poking around Virgils IG I also took note of his use of the same flag that EP and Kendrick have featured prominently

PICTURE 15

I then did more googling to see who else he was close to.. not only did he help Tyler the Creator with Golf Wang but he was also close with Frank Ocean and helped him with the company Homer

Due to How long this post is becoming, I'm going to stop here and leave you with a cliff hanger.. part 3 is next and I promise it will be good.. We haven't even reach the emerald city but I promise it will be a ""Chromakopia"" of info

2 weeks into 16:8 IF and some initial benefits:

*Food tastes 10x better

*I don’t feel compelled to eat so fast, I was having a problem with inhaling food for no good reason

*I think my stomach shrinks during the 16 so the subsequent small meals feel very satisfying and anything above a small meal feels “too full” and overwhelming.

*I wake up fresh as a daisy and naturally much earlier

*I fast 4pm - 8am bc a little food w black coffee is essential for me in the morning. While I usually go to bed “starving to death”, I almost always wake up without much hungry at all

*The 8 hour window isn’t even long enough for 3 full meals so it’s definitely not long enough to get hungry enough to crave a snack

*I find myself taking on chores with glee in the evenings while trying not to eat

some cons:

*heartburn, maybe im doing something wrong

*I feel a bit more edgy and prone to happy-crying during the fasting time

*There are many nights I want to just go to bed at 830 so I don’t cave and eat something. I dont, but I want to. The nights feel long

*I crave diet coke

Those 4 years were rough. Constantly being poor, not being sure if you are even going to have health insurance the next month (both bc of politics when I was going to college around 2014 and also my stepmom wanting to kick me off her plan), etc. Some of the courses at a 4 year university are super difficult. Especially if it is not in your interest area. For example I went and got a BSW and later entered the social work field. I loved being a social worker but I almost did not graduate because I had to take a statistics course. My mind literally CANNOT comprehend math above certain levels. Statistics and my brain do not work and that is why I never would major in math. I literally almost did not graduate even after having to pour in 3X as much work as the average student in the classroom. I begged the professor to raise my grade to a ""C"" so I could pass and they said because I showed up every single day and worked hard I'ld get a ""C"". 

Living in the dorms was a pain. My first 2 years I had to have a roommate even though I was willing to pay 2X as much to get both bed spaces to myself. Year 1 roommate was awful. A slob and snored super loud. Year 2 roommate was a religious fanatic and I did not even like being in the room. I finally got a single room the last 2 years and it was actually more like 2.5X the rate for a regular 1 rate because they know if you really want a single room you'll pay more than double. 

I have worked as a social worker in prisons (multiple ones at different security levels) and also as many other things like therapist. My BEST days of my life have always been after leaving college. Give me my worst days of my life and they were all in my college years with having to study like mad before midterms or finals. 

So no - your college years are not your best or easiest days of your life. Getting into a good paying job when you are still under the age of 40 with good job security and a good boss ARE the best days of your life. Going on multiple vacations when you have lots of money in the bank as a fully grown adult ARE the best days of your life. Being retired at age 65 and not having to ever work again and just sipping on coffee and walking in the park whenever you want ARE the best days of your life. ",9,1744650879.0,offmychest,7,0.91,False

1jz47ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThriftGrift/comments/1jz47ce/unique_thrift_union_city_nj_serious/,Unique Thrift - Union City NJ - serious,"Using a throwaway as I am not sure how far I am going to take this legally.  I was shaking for hours after I left the store and I'm still very upset and crying.  The last time I had an issue in a store, any store, was probably 1990. I just don't have those kinds of problems. I'm on the chill side and non-reactive. 

I'm hoping someone here was either in this location on Saturday April 12th or knows the name of the store manager or whoever this person was.  From what happened, I'm 100% positive this isn't the first time she's done something like this because of the severity of what happened.  You don't just wake up one day and do or say what she did.  The person I now believe to be the manager was female, short, African-American, middle-age, on the heavy side for her height and her hairstyle looked kind of like the swirl you do with frosting a cupcake, except it was swirled on the side of her head.  It was distinctive.  Both employees I asked after the incident refused to identify her, one pretending to not speak english and the other just pretending not to hear.  

Background;  I'm an older woman.  I am very polite, I don't cause problems, I have a very happy home life but I do have a serious health issue.  Because of this, I do not feel safe leaving the house alone and I only leave the house on Saturday when a very good friend takes me shopping, on errands, etc.   

This past Saturday, my friend had to complete a job farther out in NJ so I rode along, then we went to Hudson County to finish up our taxes, got coffee, went to the bakery, grocery shopping etc.  I love going to thrift shops because I have been restoring my home and I've found some awesome pieces over the years.  We almost always visit a thrift shop in whatever town/county we are in that day right before we head home.

My friend picked Unique Thrift in Union City.  We hadn't been there in at least a year and I probably hadn't been in there for 5 or 6 years before that.  

We go in together but he went to look for things he likes and I headed over to the 1st aisle to scope out the housewares/decor.  There is another customer ahead of me in the aisle and she's on her phone talking to someone while she's shopping.  I'm just going through the items in hanging bags and the shelves below, doing my thing and not really paying attention.  Eventually we are both about 75% done with the aisle and I see her pick up a chip dish/tray or something and I hear her say (on her phone, not to anyone else) something about the prices being so high and that that tray for 12.99 in this store would be 5.99 in the Union store.  I was thinking the exact same thing about the prices (they were ridiculous, there was a vintage S&P set I was looking at and it was broken and $11 something) so that's probably why her comment registered with me because I remember nothing else she said.  

Then out of nowhere, all Hell broke loose.  At first I thought it was another customer because they were throwing a tantrum like a 14 year old Taylor Swift stan overhearing someone say Taylor Swift sucks.  The woman I now believe to be a manager started shouting at the customer who was on her phone and would not stop shouting.  She was going on and on and on that she (other customer) can't shop there any more and needs to go to the Union store, she's sick of customers, and railing on and on and on.  The customer yelled back that she was having a private conversation on her phone, she shops all the stores, will shop where she pleases and tells the tantrum thrower that she was not a part of the phone conversation she was having and needs to mind her own business.  Then she goes over to the next aisle.  They are still going back and forth for a few minutes, but the other customer stops participating in the mess and I don't know if she checked out or just left.  In any case, I thought it was over.

But the tantrum thrower won't stop shouting.  I'm still minding my own business shopping but it's been a good 7 or 8 minutes with no response to her from the other customer and she's still railing non-stop vitrol about ""these customers"", it's ""her store"", she not allowing this and that.  Every time she stopped to breathe, I thought that was the end of it, but then she would start up again.  Looking back,  I probably should have just left, but it was one of those situations that you reasonably believe will wind down any second because how long could this possibly go on for ... but then it doesn't.  It's also important  to note that I was probably 7 to 10 feet away from her at all times and at no time did I approach her or engage with her.  I barely even looked at her while it was all going on. 

Finally, I have a headache from the shouting by this point so I turn around to look at her and put up my hand (Spock style, no pointing or gestures) and say ""Stop.  Please stop shouting.  The situation is over, no one is responding.  It's done.  It's over with now.  There is no reason to keep going on and on.  This has been very upsetting to listen to.  Please stop it"".  I was firm but not rude. 

So now she's shouting AT me (very) clearly.  What she said was **You're not a Christian.  You don't belong here.  Only Christians can shop here.  This is my store.  This is a Christian store.  You need to get out**. Internally, I'm thinking this can't be real and she can't possibly work here but it very much was.  She walks away and when I finally look up she's with other employees and security farther down the aisle and they are looking at me.  I walk to the next aisle because I'm done with the crazy and part of me still thinks this isn't happening.

I didn't visibly react to her or her statements but I am trying to calm myself down and staring at a picture trying to decide if I should say something or just let it go when she and another woman that had been popping up once in a while to agree with her during her tirade are suddenly right next to me.  It dawns on me that I am probably being thrown out but ... that's not what happened.  She wants to fight. 

She's being very combative and shouting at me, saying I ""wasn't there"" and ""had no right to interfere"", demanding I answer personal questions, none of which I respond to.  I manage to say I was behind the other customer the entire time so yes I was there and I wasn't interfering with anything because it was just her still shouting long after their altercation ended and it was very uncomfortable to listen to and experience.  Basically, she made it my business.  Then she says I came after her.  I'm thinking maybe John Quinones is going to step out at any second with a camera crew because he's filming a flipped version of WWYD with a non-actor being done unto to see what they would do.  I say ""Ma'am, I was at least 7 to 10 feet away from you at all times, never approached you and I am not going to fight you.""  She still claims I did, and that I'm ""rude and disrespectful"".  I say ""I asked you to please stop shouting while I was trying to shop in peace.  I was not rude or disrespectful"".  She keeps ratcheting this up, saying I still didn't answer her questions, more vitrol, I don't understand what it's like (like what exactly?  How it feels to be told ""**Only Christians can shop here**""?) and the other woman is joining in and can't stop nodding her head every time she speaks.   I think the last time I got into a fight or even tried to get into a fight I was 11.  I point out that I am sure store cameras will show otherwise and not only am I not going to fight her, I am not going to argue with her either.   She responds with ""I have a degree in criminal justice"" (um, ok), more vitrol  and keeps ranting and raving.  I'm literally afraid to make a move or try to walk away because all I can think of is the optics, I'm going to be the racist Karen who attacked two black thrift store workers if I make a wrong move and I'm starting to really panic on the inside.  I feel trapped.  

I tell them I feel threatened and unsafe and if anyone was being attacked, it's me and her response was to look at her cohort and announce that ""**These people always want to stir up drama**"" like they are in the know and on and on.  At this point I think my hearing went out and I was shaking.  No, I'm boxed in by a crazy religionist and her minion and I am in real danger.  I got such a bad feeling that this wasn't going to end well and I need to GTFO without further incident and I need to throw her off or disarm her somehow so what I ended up do was saying ""I meant no disrespect, God Bless you"" as sincerely as I possibly could while leaving my planned purchases behind and walking away quickly.  She literally responds with ""God Bless you too"".  I find my friend, he's asking me what's wrong and try to give him a 10 second version of WTF just happened and tell him we need to get out of here.  

I can't even describe what I was feeling and how shaken up I was, and still am.  I started the process of filing a Civil Rights complaint with the NJ Bias Investigation Unit.

I am just hoping that someone here had a similar experience at this store because there is absolutely no way this was her first time saying the things she said and doing the things she did or maybe knows who she is so I can name her in the complaint and don't have to go there again just to get a photo of her.   

Sorry it's so long. Thanks.  Also, Im posting in the NJ subreddit also just in case.

1jz473o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jz473o,Behind the Scenes of Our Surrogacy Mission,"Hi everyone,

I just wanted to share a bit about my recent business trip to Uzhhorod and Lviv, Ukraine, where I had the opportunity to meet wonderful new couples and guide them through their surrogacy journeys. Alongside this, my colleague and founder of Ave Fertility, Anastasia, and I made it our mission to visit several clinics in the region. We’re always striving to expand our reproductive network and offer our clients the best options, so this trip was all about finding new possibilities.

It was a challenging, whirlwind week. The trip happened on short notice and was intense at times, but we made it a point to fit in as many meetings as possible. However, being on the ground highlighted some of the realities within the industry.

I’m often asked what sets us apart or why to choose us, and these experiences really underline those answers. I won’t name names, but here’s what we encountered in some clinics during our visits.

Some clinics chose not to meet with us altogether. At one, the reception team claimed they would “pass on” our inquiries to the directors, but later we discovered the information never made it to the people in charge. At another clinic, our visit turned into an unexpected moment of shock when we noticed cockroach traps in the restroom – yes, in a clinic with a reproductive laboratory. The level of care was questionable, to say the least.

Then there was a clinic where the director sent someone else to meet us. This person couldn’t answer any of our questions but was more than willing to badmouth competitors and spread rumors. It was unprofessional behavior that felt disrespectful to everyone involved in this important field.

In yet another facility, while the setup was impressive and the clinic positioned itself as a high-end option, small details like charging visitors for coffee painted a different picture. When we bring our clients to a clinic, we want them to feel as comfortable and cared for as possible. Our hope is that they can set aside their worries and trust the people they’re relying on for something so personal and momentous.

But here’s the silver lining. Amid the less-than-ideal experiences, we found two clinics that truly stood out. These clinics not only shared our dedication to Intended Parents’ support but also aligned with our vision for what a reproductive clinic should represent. Their hospitality, professionalism, and attention to detail showed us that there are amazing teams out there who prioritize families in the same way that we do.

This trip taught us a lot. It reinforced the high standards we hold, not just for ourselves but for the partners we collaborate with. I’m incredibly proud of the progress we made during this week, despite the hurdles. And most importantly, I’m thrilled to know that we’ve identified partners who will offer our clients the care, attention, and respect they deserve.

At the end of the day, it’s about creating a space where families can feel supported and confident in what lies ahead. That’s the vision we’re building, and this trip brought us closer to making it a reality for even more Intended Parents.

I just got this machine a week ago. It’s my second machine, I’m still fairly a noob, but I cannot get this thing to pull a decent shot for the life of me. I have watched soo many videos, I understand the variables and how to dial in coffee. I have tried every grind size, every dosage in both the pressurized and unpressurized baskets, darker then lighter beans, my puck prep is on point and none of it seems to matter. I am getting nothing but watery, sour shots that are pulling way too fast, around 15 seconds, including a 5 second pre-infusion for a 1:2 ratio, with not enough pressure it seems. The pressurized basket helps a little, but still barely any crema. No crema at all in the unpressurized. The pressurized basket is also giving me extremely hard pucks at the end. Like I said, I’ve lessened the dosage, I’ve done a range of grinds. 
I don’t see many people having these issues with this machine. They’re pulling perfect shots right off the bat, saying this thing is on point for its price. I’m wondering if I need to upgrade my grinder, or if I should just return it now and not miss my window.

What I really want is to be able to truly know someone and create a real connection. I've found that just spending time talking, enjoying each other, laughing, and letting the day take us where it takes us.  I'd call myself whimsical, but grounded.  Deep, but appreciative of the absurd. 

I've never been married, no kids. I'm 5'2, brown hair, brown eyes, curvy with an hourglass shape. Really looking forward to getting to know someone amazing.",2,1744650210.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1jz3xc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jz3xc3/my_27f_ex_26m_dumped_me_in_january_after_9_years/,My (27f) ex (26m) dumped me in January after 9 years together because he didn’t think i was wife material now he reached out wanting to talk because he needs to get something off his chest I don’t know why he doing this or if I should met him? UPDATE,"So we ended up meeting and no I didn’t go to him 

I had told the receptionist at my work if he came looking for just say I’m out for the day after he showed up once I didn’t want the drama of him around my job. 

So nate just kept going to my usual places like the grocery store I go every Saturday evening or the park I ran at Sunday mornings (his words) till he would eventually run into me 

And he did yesterday he was waiting at the coffee shop I go to after my morning run. When I saw him I tried to do turn around and leave but he kept calling me so I thought to myself if everything went pear shaped a coffee shop would be safer than my walk home 

So I just sat down and asked him what he wanted 
He gave an apology that wasn’t an apology you know the type with “I’m sorry but” and “pity me” he blamed his mental health ,his job his parents,his friends everyone but himself 

I took someone’s adivce on here and said “cut the crap I already know everything” he genuinely looked shocked and stared at me for a second I guess he thought his coworker already told me everything so he couldn’t lie 

Here’s what really happened he fell for a girl in his office when he told me her name I knew her immediately I’ve met her a few times. He told for the last two years he idolised her (to be fair she’s beautiful with an amazing personality) and he hated me because I was the one stopping them from being together because his coworker was too classy to be a side piece. 
When he broke up with me he confessed to her that he was madly in love with her and he ended a 9 year relationship to be with her 

Well here’s were it gets funny she doesn’t even like him lol she called him a piece of trash and told him if he ever spoke to her outside work she’d report him to HR. So I asked him what has any of this got to do with me like we are over I clearly cut ties there’s no reason for us to speak? 

He wants to try again promised we’d get married before the year ends that we belong together, I told him no I’m nobodies second choice he threw me away after 9 years and said some pretty cruel things to me and now he thinks if he snaps his fingers I’ll come running back, he tried to beg and fake tears bringing the good times in our relationship 

I told him please leave me alone as he wasted too much of my time already. I texted my cousin to meet me at the coffee shop he kept saying nonsense even suggested if I went to couples counselling for a few months he’d leave me alone the 20 minutes it took for my cousin to arrive felt like 20 years 

In the end I just stopped listening and stood at the counter making small talk with baristas till my cousin arrived, she told him to fuck off and if he tried to follow us she’d call her brothers 

He stayed in the coffee shop as far as I know and we just went  home that’s it 

It’s only been a day but I feel like it’s over and I’m free of him

1jz3wsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jz3wsh/rf_fine/,"[RF] ""Fine.""","He didn’t want to be here anymore.  
Not in a suicidal way—at least, not the kind they talk about.  
Just in the way a man might walk into the sea, in hopes it might swallow him wholly.  
To be at one with the nothingness that asks for nothing in return.  
No note. No drama. Just silence.

The thing is, he looked alright. Chiseled jaw. Clean haircut. Said thanks, mate to the barista. Probably held doors open for old ladies.  
He knew the rules. Played the part. His smile was practiced, an automated reflex when the situation demands it. The kind of smile that didn’t quite reach the eyes, but it was enough to get through the motions. Enough to blend in.  
But inside, most days, he was flatlining.  
No ups and downs, just slowly dying and rarely living.

He wanted to cry but hadn’t in years.  
They never seem to come, and God only knows he’s tried. It’s like trying to catch a breeze in your hands. 

There was a time, maybe, when he thought it would be different. But those moments were distant. He figured the tears dried up around the same time his ambition did.  
Now he just carried this dull ache—like a splinter in his soul, too deep to pull but too persistent to ignore. Every time he thought about it, it just burrowed in deeper, occupying the spaces where he’d once thought life might be.

He’d go to the gym, swipe through dating apps, reply to emails, eat chicken and rice. Laugh at memes, double-tap a pretty girl’s story, maybe repost a reel of some shredded guru preaching discipline like it could save him. It all blurred into static.  
Everything was on autopilot. 

He didn’t need to think about it anymore. 

The gym was just a place to break a sweat, dating apps were distractions, and the food was fuel—nothing more. He couldn’t remember the last time he cooked something for the love of it. He just went through the motions like clockwork, ticking off boxes.  
Men aren’t allowed to feel anything except rage and ridicule.  
And he didn’t feel like raging.  
Didn’t feel like laughing either.  
So what was left?

“Fine.”  
That was the word. That’s all he ever said.  
“Yeah man, all good.”  
Which translates too: I’m barely holding it together, but you’re not really asking.  
He was always one bad week away.  
And lately, every week had been flirting with the line.  
But you don’t call that depression, do you?  
Not when you're paying rent, lifting weights, eating clean.  
Not when your suffering isn’t dressed for the part.  
You get told to be grateful. And if you can’t muster up the gratitude, there’s something wrong with you.

He didn’t want to die.  
He just didn’t want to do this.  
The endless loop of Get better. Be better. Do more.  
The world sold it like purpose, but it tasted like punishment.

We laugh at the wrong things.  
Make heroes of the worst people.  
Let clowns sell us dreams.

He watched another talking head online, weaponising insecurity and sell it as ‘motivation.’  
Put his phone on charge.  
Stared at the ceiling.

He remembered being a kid.  
Back when the world still felt wide enough to disappear into.  
Back when no dream felt out of reach and you could pick them out the air like dandelions.  
Before it got narrowed down to debt, deadlines, and dopamine fixes.  
Back then, the future seemed full of possibility. He missed the freedom of not knowing how to fail.

Men aren’t allowed to feel anything except rage and ridicule.  
So he chose neither.  
He chose stillness.  
Silence.  
Survival.  
A new day dawns.

He got up at six. Gym, check. Cold shower, check. Black coffee, check.  
Business as usual.

No one checked in.  
No one noticed.  
Why would they?  
He was doing “fine.”",1,1744649996.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1jz3tho,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jz3tho,Snow Peak Campfield Long Beach - April trip report and tips!,"Thanks for the help from this sub on helping prepare for this trip! We had a great time enjoying the campfield. Sharing a report in case it helps future visitors.

**Day 1 (Friday)**

Left from Seattle around 2pm. Traffic was really bad, a 3.5 hr drive turned into a ~5 hr drive. Arrived around 7pm. (** Watch your speed once you get to the town of Raymond! ** Lots of cops around handing out speeding tickets) Location is interesting as it’s right in a random residential neighborhood, but once you walk into the camp field it feels like you’re in an exclusive resort.

Check in was quick and the carts provided for wheeling gear to the campsite were very easy to use. The **Landlock **shelter and tent was already set up, along with IGT kitchen and dining table. We added on an **Alpha Breeze **tent, which was not set up, so we still had to put that one together ourselves. 

We picked **tent site 1 **based on some reviews from this sub. It was a great spot with a lot of privacy and far away from other tents/campers but you still feel right in the middle of everything. 

The entire place felt at about 1/2 capacity when we arrived, not too crowded.

The first night we just made tacos for dinner and a fire and then went to bed. It was super cold! 

**Day 2 (Saturday)**

Made breakfast and then went to check out the **camp store cafe**. It’s super cozy and nice. They have pastries and some drinks like coffee or hot chocolate and tea. We brought our own board game there and played it. The store portion has some Snow Peak gear but nothing really on sale. Actually more of the store was focused more on food/snacks/amenity items. 

They also have** Garden Unit tables **outside, we asked the staff if we could use it with the IGT flat burner from our campsite, and they were ok with it. So for lunch we cooked sukiyaki on the garden table. 

After lunch we went out to explore** Long Beach. **Honestly, the beach itself and the town was not that interesting. We also did a bit of hiking around **Cape Disappointment State Park** which was nice. But if you don’t end up leaving the campfield during the entire stay, I don’t think you’re missing out on much. If we had more time I’d want to sit in the cafe for an afternoon and read a book. Or just sit outside our tent and take a nap. 

We returned to the camp field and went to the **Ofuro Spa **at 5pm. Other reviewers have mentioned the bath water is not super hot which is true. It’s more like a heated pool. Still really nice architecture and view to enjoy. The sauna gets decently toasty. There were maybe 15-20 people total sharing the facility during our visit, so it didn’t feel as serene and relaxing as it could have been, but everyone was respectful and the pool and sauna are large enough. Note that kids are allowed in the spa (there are some adult only hours as well, I think in the morning and evening).

For dinner we rented the** Takibi grill **and made yakitori and yakiniku. We brought our own tongs which is good because the one provided is super heavy. This was one of the highlights of the trip. The takibi grill is so much fun to cook on and makes delicious food! 

**Day 3 (Sunday)**

After breakfast at the campsite we went back to **Ofuro Spa **around 10am. It was much less crowded this time (I think because many people are trying to check out by 11am and need time to pack). So I highly recommend booking the 9-11am slot and go from 10-11am. 

We checked out at around 11am. The drive back didn’t have traffic but still took around 4 hrs since we had to stop at Costco for gas, bathroom and a snack. 

Overall it was a really great, relaxing weekend retreat. I appreciate how clean and well designed the entire campground and experience is. You can tell they really pay attention to details. I do think going during the weekend is nice since the camp store is open for longer hours, and they usually have some free music events on the weekend. All the other people there were friendly and respectful of sharing the amenities. Would highly recommend going!

**Tips**
- April is a nice time to camp (though weather could be hit or miss - we had mostly sun but it did rain in the middle of the night). It was not too crowded yet. 
- Booking the Tent Suite is pretty straightforward and I think best value since it includes an entire kitchen setup and a dining table. We did the Landlock which is the lighter colored shelter. There’s also Rigel Pro that is a darker colored shelter, and it’s larger. For 4 adults the Landlock was cozy but enough space to share the shelter for cooking and meals. We decided to add another tent so we could sleep separately. 
- If you’re looking for privacy then I think site 1 is the best, all the other sites are going to be next to other people. 
- For the Jyukabo suites, number 9 imo had the nicest privacy and view. Number 8 is pretty good as well but you might get a little bit of noise and traffic from being right next to the spa 
- The neighboring yard right next to the camp store has two dogs that bark loudly in the morning. You can hear it from most of the campsite but the further away you are it gets more muffled. Bring earplugs. 
- Bring your own lighting because the ones provided are not super bright.
- Read the kitchen/utensil list carefully and don’t forget to pack extras needed for cooking. But also don’t bother bringing stuff they already provide. 
- For the Ofuro Spa you can make one reservation per day for up to 4 guests. I recommend the 9-11 slot and going at

However the amount of reprogramming I’ve had to do, to unlearn this terms and conditions god that the lds church teaches is insane. For so many years I’ve instilled so much religious shame and guilt within myself. Never angry at god, but myself. I never felt worthy. Obviously there are things that you should never do which is self explanatory no kind person would. However, Everytime I’d turn around there was a new term and condition to gods love that I was taught. No coffee, no this , no that. That’s just it though, when you read the Bible and you’re not going off of purely what others are telling you, you will see that god is a forgiving god. He’s loving and kind. He’s not judging and shameful. He makes the best lessons out of the most imperfect people to show that it’s okay to not be perfect but to be willing to love and forgive and learn from your mistakes. I just get so frustrated because the Mormon church my whole life has been telling me ways that I wouldn’t be worthy, that not choosing the perfect worthy life would end me up in a different kingdom when apparently families are forever? It makes no sense, how people who aren’t paying 10% aren’t “worthy” of the temple or blessings from the church. I will forever and ever vouch for the nondenominational Christian community. Simply because you can go in as you are, there’s offerings if you choose to. If you don’t you’re not worth any less. a homeless person would be stared down and dogged in a lds church where as a nondenominational Christian church would accept them and offer them to come back again. I don’t know, I’ve done a lot of healing and self love work and it just makes me sad that there’s people out there that think they’re just this horrible person because they are human. Many times people end up completely straying away from god because of the shame.

Somewhere where we can be together, in some unknown place where life was fair to both of us, where the outcome and reality of us matched our desires. I’ve built this place from the ground up, but it only exists in my head.  

We wake up here together, the sun is always beautiful in the mornings here.  Most days I wake up before you and watch you sleep, the outline of your beautiful body with the single white sheet covering up your curves.  I lay there for a while every time, happy to just be next to you.  

You sleep well here, we both do.   We sit on our balcony and sip coffee as we watch the town below us start to come to life.  We gather our thoughts and plan our day of work, though it never feels overwhelming here.  All the struggles we have in the real world aren’t hard to overcome when we are together.  

We leave together, I’m ready first but I’m not mad I have to wait for you, I know you’re worth it.   We smile and laugh on the way to our first meeting.  They aren’t happy, but you smooth things over perfectly before lunch.  

We go out for lunch some days, others we go back home and you make me something, though I always offer to, you like to do it for me.   We are happy, spending our days together watching our business grow, smiling and laughing at how easy it is with one another.  

Afternoons are filled with busywork and flirting.  I don’t know how we get the work done everyday with the constant distraction of you, but we always seem to.   

We go to the gym before dinner, work hard to stay in shape for each other, push each other when needed.  We both sweat and shower together when we get home.   I’ll grill some food while you make the sides and pour us a drink.  You come outside and give me a gentle squeeze while I’m cooking and hand me the glass.  We kiss, and savor the moment as the sun is setting.  

We lay on the couch inside after dinner, both doing what we want,  you’re reading a book while I watch a show,  your legs draped over my lap.  Sometimes you catch me staring at you, that’s just me still being struck by your beauty.   

Our life isn’t always perfect, sometimes we disagree, but we love each other and words are never used as weapons.  We somehow get along, different opinions and thoughts are welcomed and discussed openly.  They are never an indictment on our character.  We have harder days, but they are always brighter than they could be if we weren’t together.

Our eyes meet at some point, hungry at the same time.  It doesn’t matter who makes the first move, we are both thinking the same thing.   A devilish smile crosses your face, as I suddenly wake back up.  We feel like teenagers every night and as we fall asleep we are both exited for what the next day holds.   

Though I know in my alternate reality there is so many mundane things unspoken, they don’t matter.  They are insignificant and a minor annoyance at best.  The truth is that cleaning up a small mess, doing the laundry, washing the dishes, all the trivial little tasks are enjoyable with you in my life.  

I love the life we’ve built, I think about it often as I miss you.   I love you so much.

I don’t even know how to begin this without sounding like a cliché, fake or something, but here it goes. This isn’t some wild fantasy or twisted drama. this is really happening, and I’m still trying to process it.

I started being a sugar baby last year. I was drowning in tuition debt, student bills, living costs, and just... life. A friend (who’d been doing this longer than I had) introduced me to a reputable agency. One that actually has policies in place for safety and professionalism, like supervised first dates and 6-month contract renewals. It felt weird and scary at first, but I was desperate, and compared to some of the horror stories I’d heard, this one felt safe. Professional.
It only took about a month and a half before someone chose me. Let's just call him Greg. He’s 71. And yes, I know how that sounds. But bear with me.

Our first date was under management supervision like the agency required. We went out to a quiet high end restaurant. He was tall....like, 6'1 towering over me (I'm only 4'11. Asian did me dirty with my height lol). Silver hair, very well put together, and honestly in better shape than most guys my age. I found myself laughing and smiling way more than I thought I would. He was a total gentleman. He didn’t try to impress me with money or flashy things. He asked questions about me. He listened.

He told me upfront he had been with a few sugar babies before, but never renewed their contracts because he found them... obnoxious, his word. But he picked me because he saw my traits in my profile. I'm submissive, quiet, respectful. Not in a doormat way. Just... softspoken, I guess? 
He also admitted he gets lonely. His kids and grandkids are busy with their own lives, and while he doesn't resent them for it, he said the silence in his big house can be deafening sometimes. He wanted company. Intimacy. Affection.

It felt strange at first, but he was never pushy. He told me to be myself. To tell him if anything made me uncomfortable. He covered my school bills, tuition, helped me with my living expenses. After a while, he asked me to move in, saying it’d be easier and safer than living in a dorm or struggling to pay rent. (Yes, this is allowed under the agency policy as long as the agency is informed)

He even assigned a driver to take me to and from university so I wouldn’t stress about transportation. Over time, I got used to the arrangement. The closeness. The consistency.

Yes, we’ve been intimate. But even then, he’s always been gentle and respectful. He always asked first. Always made sure I was okay. And if I said no? He’d just kiss my forehead or cheek, hold me, and say “okay, sweet girl.” He never pressured me. Never made me feel like I owed him something. We’d cuddle, he really like to hold me on his lap while we watched old movies or while he worked in his home office. He liked being close. I didn’t mind it. I... liked it, actually.
Last night, after we were done being intimate and had cleaned up, we were lying there, cuddling like always. Then out of nowhere, he said it:
“I love you”

He’s said it before, but always in the moment, while we're doing it. I never took it seriously. I figured it was just... ""heat of the moment"" stuff. But this time, it was different. He said it quietly. Clearly. While looking me right in the eye.

Then he asked me to marry him.

Not in a grand way. No ring. No speech. Just... softly. Like he’d been thinking about it for a while. He told me he knows it’s a big ask. That he doesn’t want me to rush. That he loves me. not as a sugar baby, but as a woman. That our connection feels real to him.
I didn’t say anything. I just curled into his chest and we eventually fell asleep.

It’s morning now. I’m typing this in his guest room, while he’s downstairs making coffee like nothing happened. I feel... conflicted.

I like him. Maybe even more than I want to admit. But I’ve always thought of him as a “job.” As someone I’m supposed to stay professional with. And now, everything feels blurry. I don’t know what to feel. Also it's a lot to ask. It's marriage for godsake😭

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Because my heart is all over the place right now, and I don’t know who to talk to. ",136,1744648923.0,TrueOffMyChest,155,0.72,False

Kenny was sitting two stools down, also with luggage. he made some joke about how the universe must really want us to appreciate small town America, I laughed. we got to talking, found out we were both heading to the same general area. he was interviewing for some position and i told him I worked in logistics. after a few hours of talking, and a couple beers, we exchanged numbers.

For example, while I was in school, I had to tell my physical exercise teacher that some movements were hard for me to do, especially up and down movements, and I felt a little worried to tell her because I didn't have an exact diagnosis yet. I remember my jaw was shaking a little and my body felt super light. 

A few days ago, about a year and a half being diagnosed with pots, I had this realization that little moments that might have just barely caught my attention a couple years ago make by body react out of control. It's hard to explain so I'm doing the best that I can, but yesterday I was in a coffee shop and noticed this guy acting a little strangely. I've only started to do things on my own in public recently, trying to not let pots affect my whole life. I guess this man wasn't something to be completely concerned about, but his mannerisms just made me want to stay away. I was taking some notes and out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw him coming towards me. It felt like my blood pressure had dropped drastically and I started getting really dizzy. My nervousness shot through the roof until he walked past me. 

For the rest of the day I felt on edge and shaky. I had to put my compression socks back on also. I'm not sure if these types of moments are pots related, but its just so surprising how out of control I react. I forget to breathe sometimes too lol, but I don't know why it happens.

I'm interested in getting a group toogether of 4-5 play3rs at enchanted grounds down in Littleton. Eventually running it at my home if all goes well and i get a good coffee table. I've mostly ran online but I'm hoping to make some irl friends and build a bit of a community. 

Im a 27 year old DM with seven years of experience running games. Most of that is with fifth edition D&D, but I have a few other systems under my belt as well such as; Shadow of the Demon Lord, Morkborg, and Dungeon Crawl Classics. 

Time wise I'd prefer to run games on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays. Starting at 6pm and ending at 10pm as that's when enchanted grounds closes for the night. I'd likely run 5e, a module, unless players agree on something else. New players welcome but please be over 18.

Once the bed is exposed after the final pour, I've been letting it continue to drip until dripping slows, for 30 seconds or so, and when I remove the filter I've been squeezing out some of the last bits of liquid. 

I watched a Lance Hedrick video about sour and bitter flavours and how they're stronger in the early and late parts of extraction and it got me wondering, am I adding a dose of extra-bitter coffee with this end-of-brew technique?

1jz33rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlderGenZ/comments/1jz33rv/i_quit_online_dating_and_i_feel_better/,I quit online dating and I feel better.,"If anyone remembers, about 3 weeks ago, I posted on this subreddit about my problems with dating. Here is the link if anyone wants a refresher on what I was talking about. [https://www.reddit.com/r/OlderGenZ/comments/1jjj1p5/dating\_in\_2025/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OlderGenZ/comments/1jjj1p5/dating_in_2025/)

So after taking the advice of some helpful commenters, I realise the best way to stop feeling shitty about myself was to quit dating apps. I quit the apps almost 2 weeks ago. 

It happened because I was supposed to go on a date with a girl older than me, but she couldn't come as she was busy at work. She then asked if we could reschedule, and I said sure. But I couldn't take the disappointment and the burnout of the dating apps anymore. I texted, ""I'm sorry, but I'm tired of dating apps."" I promptly deleted the apps. I drank some hot chocolate and ate some cheesecake to swallow the pain down my throat. As I left the coffee shop we were supposed to meet at, I kept seeing and bumping into people who were in love, in relationships, and in couples. This only made me angrier and more bitter.

 I decided to delete the apps and stay off of it for a bit. Ever since then, I don't feel as bitter or miserable looking at couples or feeling super lonely as before. I just feel like moving on with my life and just focusing on my goals and the things I wanted to do. 

But as the days go by, I'm wondering how long of a break I should take before I can go back on the apps. A month? Six? A year? I haven't taken a break from the apps for longer than 5 minutes a day in the last three and a half years. I feel good, I don't feel lonely when I wake up, and I don't think about my ex as much as I used to. 

I just would like to hear of some other people's experiences of taking breaks from dating apps my age and how it affected them.

Pt 12,"Elle reached into her pocket and pulled out a flash drive. She placed it gently on the coffee table in front of me. I registered Nichole’s rigidity as the thing was presented. What was she afraid of? I suspected the contents were important but felt a stab of annoyance because we had no way of digging into it. I hadn’t packed a computer on this trip. Elle had an expectant look – as if waiting for praise. 

Unsure of what else to say, I blandly replied, “Um…thank you, Elle.” She gave an appreciative smile and gestured for me to pick it up, so I did. I sat there for a moment feeling foolish just holding the drive. “How did you get this? How did you get the picture you sent to the police? Or the DVD?” I meant to ask only the first part, but the follow-ups spilled out before conscious thought could filter them. Elle was undeterred.

“From…hos..pit..al. Lab had…files. No one…to stop…me. Took many…things…put into…bag,” Elle rested her throat for a moment, then continued. “Just…in case. Wanted…proof.” I should have thought of that, I scolded myself. She killed everyone that could have prevented her (or me) from rifling through that underground prison and taking whatever they had. Even if they intended to let us escape, I don’t think Elle’s fatal rampage was expected. 

I held up the drive and looked at Nichole, the question evident without speaking. She vacillated, but then nodded, resignedly. She stood up and walked out of the room, finally holstering the gun. 

She walked back into the living room after a couple of minutes. She was carrying a thin, sleek, silver laptop in her left hand, and a long black charging cord in her right. She motioned to Aaron to sit on the floor next to the table, silently inviting him into the world she had wanted to hide from him. She connected the cord to the laptop, then plugged it into the wall. She reclaimed her seat, placing the computer in front of herself and opening it. It took only a minute or so for the thing to power on and then she held out her hand for the drive. She took a deep breath, inserted the drive into a USB port on the side of the laptop, and then opened its folder. There was a single video file. It had no title. Nichole shifted the screen to allow all of us to see and then double-clicked the file.

The video displayed four different angles of the same thing simultaneously. There was a man, his hands and feet tied to a chair. There was a black bag over his head. A moment later, two men walked into the room. One of the men was tall and wiry. His frame looked abnormal as though each section had been stretched slightly too long. His narrow, ice blue eyes were too close together under heavy brown eyebrows, which seemed to be the only hair he had. His skin was eerily pale, and the light made him look jaundiced. The other man was stalky with a muscular build, like a boxer. His eyes were light brown, which contrasted greatly with his deep brown skin. His demeanor felt both reassuring and menacing, like having a loaded gun under your pillow. They spoke for a moment, apparently discussing the bound man.

“We knock him around a bit; he’ll talk. He’s got no training. Just some Joe Blow scientist – a lowly lab rat that worked under the doc,” one of the men suggested to the other. He had a New York accent; his tone was grating with a nasal quality.

“No,” a deep, smooth voice said quite calmly. “We give him to Kata. There’s no time for the regular approach. He’s not just a scientist. He’s THE scientist. The whole project is based on his research. Dr. Braun knows someone talked. If this guy is the one trying to expose us, everything falls on top of us. And I don’t want to go to jail, do you?” The other man said nothing.

The bigger of the two men laid his large hand on the prisoner’s head, and, in one swift motion, ripped off the bag, revealing a petrified face. His hand reached down and jerked the poor man’s chin upward, looked into his eyes, as if questioning his captive’s alertness. The door closed with a creaking thump and the men looked toward it.

“He’s ready,” the tall one said.

We could see the man now struggling with the zip ties binding his hands. His wrists were fastened so tightly that his fingers were red and probably numb. His eye was puffed and purpled. He was breathing ragged, shallow breaths, as he looked up to see a woman. She walked in and dismissed her two compatriots with a simple wave of her hand. She started toying with instruments on the surgical tray in front of her. Sweat dripped with an incessant and steady tempo from the man’s brow. He looked on the verge of collapse. He was strapped into a stiff wooden chair with a wobbly leg. It was subtle psychological torture.

“Don’t fret now, sweetie. You have something I want, something I need,” the woman purred. There was an accent in her voice, but not one I recognized. She was thoroughly enjoying herself. She brushed the metal tools with her fingertips, pausing for just a sliver of a breath on each. She treated each piece with reverence. She was a blushing bride at Tiffany’s with her pick of the rings. Her features were rough hewn from years in harsh weather and bad lighting. Her hairstyle was short with a blunt edge angled at the face, pitch black, and well groomed. She wore no makeup, save for barely noticeable lip gloss. The lip gloss distracted me momentarily; it seemed out of place, even slightly lurid set against its otherwise baren canvas. The flickering fluorescent bulbs threw her severe features into sharp relief, and it did nothing to alleviate the tone of fear and panic.

“I have been waiting to play with you. We have been watching you for some time. Do you know the value of your little secrets? You must, since you tell me nothing, professor.” She picked a wicked contraption from the tray, something a sadistic dentist would wield. Phillip seemed hypnotized by the object, paralyzed. Her dull brown eyes reluctantly shifted from the object to his face, relishing the panic there. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes, pushing forth unbidden, making tracks in the blood and dirt, and betraying his fright. He made a face that said he wanted to scream, beg for mercy, but for all his vocal efforts, all he could manage was a muffled whimper through the duct tape across his mouth. This pleased the woman; she nearly giggled.

I saw him looking around desperately, possibly hoping to find some escape. His shaky chair was placed in the center of the small room. It had yellowed paint that may once have been white peeling from the walls, exposed pipes running from floor to ceiling, and cold concrete beneath his feet. An interminable plop and splash sound from the leaking pipes was becoming more irritating than was rational.

“I said not to fret. And look! You cry. I thought you were a big, tough man! You sure put up a fight when they caught you. You broke poor Andrew’s nose. And now, with little old me, you cry? What would your father say?” She leaned toward him, brandishing the shiny, silver device.

“Oh, Phillip, I will not kill you – not yet, not unless you make me.” She traced her finger around his bloody, sweaty face, wrinkled her nose at the filth, and wiped her hand with a cloth draped across her lap. “I really admire your work – studied all your research, but I still have a job to do. You understand. Who have you told about us?” She glared at him, waiting. “We know you have been talking. A file from the genetics lab was copied using your credentials. We found a burned-up computer and cell phone in your home. What were you trying to hide from us? You think that your work belongs to you? No. Everything inside your beautiful brain belongs to US.”

She placed the gadget back on the tray. “I think we’ll start with something a little…simpler. Hmm?”
I could see the tension in his body, by no means gone, eased ever so slightly in his shoulders. The woman stood, strolled to the other side of the room, her hands hovering inches above a table by the heavy metal door, and retrieved a small pouch. She was unexpectedly graceful. I looked on with a growing morbid curiosity.

“I have always loved how the most basic methods can provide remarkable results. Take bamboo,” she mused while picking a bamboo shoot from the pouch. She looked at it, fascinated. The man looked at it, too, horrified. “Bamboo is such a basic thing, but if I remove your shoe, and wedge this tiny thing under your toenail. Well, the possibilities number the stars, really.”

The man, Phillip, screamed through his gag.
“Now, now. I can see you don’t believe me. Let me show you. It is really something. I promise.” She smiled as she slipped off his shoes.

She continued the torture for some time. The woman did not ask him more questions. She grinned each time the man shrieked or cried out. Who was this man? What was his research? Was he really trying to expose them?

The video (all angles) went to black, and for several seconds nothing appeared, then it showed two different men dragging “Phillip” down a corridor and tossing him into what could only be described as a prison cell. There were no windows in this room, but it might have been on an exterior wall because I could hear a raging storm thrashing against the building. The floor was bare. The similar concrete walls were also bare except one. Bolted on the back wall, opposite the door, there was a set of menacing iron shackles.

They had untied his hands and feet – which were grotesque with some of the toenails gone completely after the woman had finished with him. He crumpled into a sobbing, bloody mass in one corner of his cell. She has broken him physically, but he had not given up whatever secret they wanted from him.

We heard footsteps nearing the bulky wooden door that had him sealed. The man lifted his head slightly to listen and froze. The heavy tread approached the door then continued without pause. He then rested his head once more on the concrete floor. His whole body shivered and shuddered, most likely from cold but also from the shock of torture.

There was just a constant yellow light that crept in under the door. The video captured a long portion of him curled into a fetal position. Nichole opted to scroll through the footage until we saw the man finally stir. He sat up with his knees pulled up to his chin. Gingerly, he inspected his feet. The toes were almost black from bruising, jagged shards of toenail clinging to skin. 

Eventually, he laid back down on his side and drifted into sleep. Nichole fast forwarded again.
Until we saw the man jump as the metallic clanking of the door being unlocked jarred him awake. He drew himself up, first into a sitting position, then, awkwardly to a semi standing one. The door groaned open. A man, silhouetted in the doorframe loomed over him. He closed his eyes against the dazzling light from the corridor behind the door.

“Turn around. Face the wall and put your hands behind your back.” This wasn’t one of the two from the interrogation room – another new anonymous bad guy. The man’s hands were once again being zip tied. Then we heard a wretched appeal coming from Phillip, repeating a single word to his jailor, “Please. Please. Please….”

The man grabbed the back of Phillip’s head and knocked it into the wall. “Shut up. You had your time to talk. We don’t need you anymore.”
As he was led out the door, dragging his hobbled feet, we heard a horrible, chilling scream. Aaron gasped, pressing his hand over his mouth, eyes glued to the screen. Then the video ended, leaving the four of us in stunned and silent contemplation. Why didn’t they need him anymore? Did they kill him?

Nichole cleared her throat and said, “I… I knew him. Not personally… but I knew of him. Everyone did. Dr. Phillip Elkan. He was the primary scientist for the project. Dr. Braun was his supervisor and military counterpart. They said he died in a car wreck. I didn’t even think about questioning that.” Nichole’s face was drained of all color.

When we would go out to eat (as friends), he would always pay for our food together. At first, I didn't question it because he would say it was a way of paying me back (I used to help in school assignments, etc). I thought, cool, free food. But now it's like a reoccurring thing. On Saturday, we went to Philly and got boba from a boba shop. I offered to pay for his drink with mine, but he said no need and pulled out his card, tapping it on the card machine before I could say okay or not.

A little background, he comes from a wealthy family. His family has their own business in construction. He always had a large allowance, and he works for his family sometimes, so they pay him too. I have a weekend job, now as a cashier. I don't make as much as him, but I have enough to treat him out for something. But he never really accepts it, telling me I should just save my money. He said it's also a waste for me to buy him lunch, since my parents check my receipts and statements anyway.

I just feel really bad. I've kinda stopped ordering drinks or lunches when we go out together. I don't want him to pay for everything. A few of my friends don't think there's anything wrong with it. The rest of my friends think that if I let him keep doing this, I'll be a 'gold digger' or something. I appreciate the things he does, but I don't want him to think that I'm taking advantage of him.

Today at school (my school has a student coffee shop) he wanted to buy me some coffee or food there, but I said no. He looked kinda sad when I said that, and now I feel even worse for rejecting it. My friends (the ones who didn't see a problem with it) said that I was a bit of an a-hole for that. ",2,1744647389.0,AITA_Relationships,12,1.0,False
