# THE HIVE HAS FALLEN — AND THE STARS SHINE AGAIN!

**Monroe Confesses. Presley Roars. Sinatra Returns. America Rediscovers Its Heart.**

*By Eloise Harland, Senior Editor-at-Large*

Los Angeles — They called it “The Silence.”  
For nearly a decade, the voices that once defined American life — the crooners, the dreamers, the screen sirens — were muted under a regime that insisted order was art, and art was obedience.

But on a warm April night in 1966, at the newly restored Paramount Grand Pavilion, the silence broke for good. Marilyn Monroe stepped onto the stage in a dress of pale gold and spoke into a single standing microphone.

“I used to think perfection was beauty,” she said softly, “but now I know beauty is being alive — and allowed to speak.”

The crowd, packed with figures who had vanished into blacklists and rumors, erupted into applause. Sinatra stood from his seat, tears visible even under the spotlights. Elvis Presley, hair longer and voice rougher than before, lit a cigarette and nodded slowly, mouthing the words *“Welcome home.”*

# THE REBIRTH OF A CULTURE

It has been one year since California Governor Ursula K. Le Guin signed the Artistic Rehabilitation Act, lifting the bans placed on thousands of artists during the Formicist era. California remains untouched as the center of American popular culture and entertainment. Hollywood has since become a symbol of national recovery — a glimmering city rising from ideological ashes.

Studios once requisitioned by the “Bureau of Collective Image” are now privately owned again, though many still bear the scars of surveillance. At MGM, workers claim they can still see the outline of the old state emblem — a stylized ant — beneath a new mural of Monroe’s smiling face.

Everywhere, there is a feverish mix of guilt, joy, and disbelief. Reporters describe America’s pop culture revival as a “psychological exhale.” Jazz clubs that had gone underground now overflow onto the streets. Broadway is sold out for the first time since 1957. Theaters run newsreels titled *The Stars Return*, chronicling the restoration of the blacklisted generation.

But not everyone is celebrating without unease. As one anonymous studio executive told *Revue*,

“It feels like we’re waking from a nightmare — but we’re not sure if the dream’s over, or just beginning again.”

[Governor Guin's obsession of the arts and craft has certain given her supporters across the entertainment industry.](https://preview.redd.it/ugsb2zb8f0zf1.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=60692be20ee99c269e3a8fbb578fb2196cc5a0f1)

# MONROE’S SECOND LIFE

No return has been more symbolic — or more controversial — than that of Marilyn Monroe, the “Last Muse of the Ant Age.”

Once the radiant face of the Haskins administration’s “Cultural Harmony Program,” Monroe was seen in stylized propaganda reels, smiling serenely beneath banners that read *“Beauty Through Unity.”* In 1962, her likeness appeared on state-printed posters extolling “discipline in desire.”

Now, she calls it her greatest regret.

In her new memoir, *The Eyes and I*, Monroe, turned 40 this June, describes being manipulated into becoming “the goddess of obedience” for a regime that saw emotion as weakness. She writes of late-night visits from the Bureau of Aesthetic Order, of scripts rewritten by bureaucrats, of weeks spent in isolation when she asked for creative control.

Her confession has ignited both fascination and forgiveness. *Life*, *The Republic Journal*, and *The Voice Weekly* have all featured her on their covers — but only *Revue ’66* secured her first full interview since her reinstatement.

“I believed in order,” Monroe told us, “because chaos was all I’d known. I wanted peace — I didn’t know peace could become a prison.”

She now plans to star in *The Mirror Queen*, a film by director Stanley Kubrick, rumored to be a surreal dramatization of her years inside the propaganda machine. Sources say the production was nearly blocked by remnants of the old Cultural Bureau — and only survived after the President himself intervened.

[Ms. Monroe has been called the pinnacle of American beauty and splendor from people across the world.](https://preview.redd.it/2g3p766jf0zf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa7596017b99c887e6a698afbfcec2b7285637cf)

# SINATRA’S SONG OF THE REPUBLIC

From exile to encore, Frank Sinatra has returned with the defiance of a man who never learned silence. His album *Songs for Happier Days*, released last month, has already sold two million copies — a phenomenon critics are calling “The Second Swing Age.”

At a private press gathering, Sinatra lit a cigar and smirked,

“I used to sing for the system. Then I sang against it. Now I just sing because they can’t shut me up.”

His track *“Loud Times Inbound”* — a smoky, aching ballad about the years of censorship — has become an unofficial anthem of the Seasongood era. Rumor has it that even the President requested it be played at his inaugural dinner.

“‘Cause brighter days are comin’, ‘o the loud days inbound! Jump for joy and take a knee, for new days are coming for you and me…”, Sinatra sang. 

Yet Sinatra remains a divisive figure. Declassified files revealed his brief detention in 1960 for “moral subversion,” which he jokes about now in interviews. “You haven’t lived,” he quipped to reporters last week, “until you’ve been told you become a national threat.”

[Everyone in America has heard the low, soothing voice of Mr. Sinatra.](https://preview.redd.it/imrzrd5qf0zf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a85a6fd0af7dd3e0724eb4b45b40f37fdad8323)

# THE NEW FRONTIER OF SOUND

Across the country, jukeboxes hum again. Presley’s *Ant Hill Blues* and Nina Simone’s *Freedom Train* dominate radio charts. Record stores display posters reading “Music is Resistance.” The old culture of idol worship has given way to something more raw — almost spiritual.

The people do not want perfection anymore; they want presence.

One critic in *The Republic Review* put it bluntly:

“The new America doesn’t dream of stars. It listens to the cast of survivors.”

# PART II: “THE REBELS RETURN — THE SOUND, THE SCREEN, THE SOUL”

*By Eloise Harland, continued from page 1*

# ELVIS RETURNS TO THE AIRWAVES — “THE ELECTRIC PROPHET” IS BACK

Memphis — On the night of March 12th, every television set from Boston to San Francisco flickered to life. A single spotlight cut across a marble hall — the Capitol Rotunda, reclaimed as a stage. Out stepped Elvis Presley, hair untamed, guitar scarred, jacket stitched from the denim of a thousand laborers.

He didn’t salute. He didn’t smile. He simply said:

“They took my voice. I took it back.”

Then came the opening chords of *“Ant Hill Blues,”* which once placed Presley on a government blacklist. For fourteen minutes the nation watched a once-taped man sing the end of obedience. Crowds gathered outside appliance-store windows; soldiers in distant bases tuned their camp radios. When he finished, the applause lasted five full minutes — even Congress, we’re told, stood.

Since that broadcast, the record has sold faster than any in living memory. The phrase *“Shake the Rotunda”* is now graffiti shorthand for youthful defiance. The government tolerates the slogan — barely. A few senior ministers mutter that “rock breeds anarchy,” but President Seasongood, when asked, only smiled:

“After so many years of silence, I’ll take a lil’ noise.”

[Mr. Presley has been called both a heartthrob and a pixie.](https://preview.redd.it/k9esz0qbg0zf1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=57085b674e462b55ae487302fe14cda383c63a8a)

# AUDREY HEPBURN — “THE SAINT IN EXILE” COMES HOME

New York City — The crowd outside the St. Regis Hotel was hushed, almost reverent. After seven years in voluntary exile, Audrey Hepburn stepped out of a cab clutching nothing but a script and a single red rose. The script: *The Still Garden*, an independent film about a woman rebuilding her life after the collapse of an unnamed “order.” The rose, she told reporters, was “for every friend who didn’t come back.”

Hepburn’s quiet dignity has become a balm to the republic’s raw conscience. During the Weber term, she refused to perform in the Bureau’s “Harmony Dramas,” choosing exile in Canada over compliance. Her return has made her a living symbol of grace without submission.

Critics who previewed *The Still Garden* call it “a miracle of restraint” — a film with almost no dialogue, where silence itself becomes rebellion. Its premiere next month is already sold out, proceeds pledged to rebuild bomb-damaged libraries in Detroit Sector Nine.

Rumor insists that Hepburn will soon address the Senate Cultural Committee about the need for “moral memory in art.” If true, it would make her the first actress ever to testify not as a defendant, but as a conscience.

[Ms. Hepburn's charm has been said to exceed even Aphrodite.](https://preview.redd.it/i5yj3j2xg0zf1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab037f1cf57fc2bc430a972af7909f109b98e5e)

# KUBRICK’S NEW VISION — “THE MAN WHO FILMED THE MACHINE”

London — While America applauds its singers, one of its strangest sons prepares to confront its ghosts on screen. Stanley Kubrick, returning from exile after agreeing to emigrate under President Haskins’s “social parasite” plan, has resurfaced with a project so audacious that even his former censors whisper admiration: *2001: An Space Odyssey.*

Leaked production stills show glass corridors, faceless drones, and a single human astronaut drifting toward a colossal hive-world. Insiders say the film asks whether mankind, in seeking perfect order, becomes its own insect.

Kubrick himself, reached by telephone, said only:

“It’s not about some random hive in space. It’s about us — when we forget how to be alone.”

Back in 1962, authorities had granted him conditional clearance to release the picture in an indeterminate amount of time provided “edits for civic sensitivity.” Friends say he laughed at that phrase for an hour. Thankfully for Mr. Kubrick, the Seasongood administration has given their full support in releasing the project. New Mexico Governor Joseph Montoya has even expressed interest in Kubrick’s film to be shot in the desert scenery of New Mexico.

[With the Space Age in full swing, Mr. Kubrick seems to be capitalizing as much as he can.](https://preview.redd.it/f4x2gp9bh0zf1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc7a0df3902c864dd9b5d1317e0dfa8369c42c10)

# THE PEOPLE’S CINEMA AND THE NEW AMERICAN DREAM

From Hollywood to Harlem, a new generation of artists is rewriting the nation’s story. Students paint murals of shattered ant-emblems beside portraits of jazz musicians. Poets perform verses about “machines with human hearts.” Theaters host *Midnight Circle*, a talk show where comedians trade punchlines with senators under the banner “Freedom Is Funny Again.”

Box offices report record crowds, but audiences behave differently now. They clap longer, cry harder, linger after credits roll. Many leave flowers at theater doors — tributes to those lost to censorship and political violence. Fame has become ritual, and ritual a form of healing.

Sociologist Dr. Leonora Bright describes it best:

“Pop culture is the only church left that everyone still attends.”

# THE COST OF GLAMOUR

Yet beneath the neon revival runs a pulse of guilt. Former informants, producers who cooperated with the Bureau, and actors who starred in Formicist films all walk among the reborn elite. Some whisper of quiet blacklists still circulating — not from the state this time, but from the public itself.

The question hangs in every studio bar and nightclub: *Can art forgive itself?*

Monroe says yes. Presley shrugs. Hepburn weeps. Sinatra drinks to forget. Kubrick doesn’t answer.

And America — beautiful, fractured America — keeps watching.



# PART III: “CULTURE & SOCIETY — THE FUTURE IS BEAUTIFUL (AND STRANGE)”

*By Harriet Dorne, Culture Editor*

# THE NEW AMERICANS LOOK TO THE STARS

You can tell what a country dreams of by the posters on its bedroom walls — and lately, they’re all of rockets.

Since President Seasongood’s “Declaration of Wonder” last June, America has entered what the press calls the Second Space Fever. The government’s *Celestial Initiative* promises “the first civilian voyage beyond the stratosphere” by 1968 — but it’s the culture, not the policy, that’s truly taken flight.

* “Cosmic Vogue”: Metallic skirts and silver-thread coats are this spring’s must-have. Designers call it *astro-chic*. Men’s ties now sparkle with embroidered constellations. Even Monroe was spotted wearing a ring shaped like Saturn.  
* “Zero-G Jazz”: Miles Davis’s latest experiment — music recorded in the *near-weightless training chamber* of the Air Force’s “Project Ascend.” The result? Notes that shimmer and slide, as if gravity itself had lost discipline.  
* “Sky Dwellers”: NBC’s newest drama follows a family running a gas station on the edge of the stratosphere. It’s equal parts soap opera and sermon about ambition. Critics adore it; scientists roll their eyes; viewers can’t look away.  

And then there’s the rumor no one can confirm: that a private consortium of wealthy exiles — artists, scientists, even a few repentant Formicists — are funding something called Project Eden, a “creative colony in orbit.” The President’s office refuses to comment. For now.

# THE NEW AGE OF NEW AGE

After years of rigid collectivism, Americans are hungry for the mystical — and the marketplace delivers. Astrology pamphlets sell faster than Bibles; “aura photographers” set up in department stores; communes bloom in the deserts of Nevada, promising “Freedom through Vibration.”

The most fashionable sect? The Transcendental Republic Movement — a spiritual offshoot of the old resistance, teaching that “to rebuild a nation, one must first rebuild the soul’s frequency.” Half the Hollywood elite attend its Sunday meditations at Griffith Observatory, where telescopes double as prayer altars.

Even the President reportedly keeps a quartz sphere on his desk, “for clarity.”

# FASHION AFTER UNIFORMITY

No more gray tunics, no more symmetry codes. The rigid Formicist aesthetic is out of vogue — and the designers are having a riot.

* The Monroe Cut — loose, unpatterned fabric that defies geometric order — is this year’s rebellion.  
* “Hivewreck Chic” — torn metallics and structured jackets purposefully frayed — mocks the old bureaucratic aesthetic.  
* Eyeshadow in “Freedom Blue” sold out nationwide within a week after Monroe wore it on her return broadcast.  

One tabloid quipped:

“After ten years of telling us what to wear, the Bureau should’ve expected we’d come out naked.”

[The Avant-Garde is no longer Avant-Garde.](https://preview.redd.it/10d6dacqh0zf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdf2375473cbd93291f899f2bb77575f1992bc8b)

**SMALL SCREEN, BIG IDEAS**

Television, once the voice of the state, now plays the role of therapist. Every evening, millions tune in not for politics, but for *comfort*.

* **“The Morning Colony”** — a breakfast variety show featuring comedians who mock the old slogans (“Work Is Joy! Joy Is Work!”). Viewers write in with their own rewritten versions, the best earning a week’s worth of coffee rations.  
* **“Children of the Stars”** — PBS’s most-watched educational program. Hosted by astrophysicist Dr. Carl Sagan, it teaches kids to think freely — a dangerous novelty, once upon a time.  
* **“The Late Orbit”** — America’s first televised philosophical salon, where thinkers debate the ethics of machines, memory, and mankind. Last week’s guest: a roboticist who claimed the Formicists were “the first artificial intelligence — just without the hardware.”  

# CINEMA SHORTS: GOSSIP FROM THE LOTS

* Kubrick’s *The Mirror Queen* — starring Monroe — is reportedly shooting scenes in the Mojave under “complete secrecy.” Locals say the set glows at night with strange blue light.  
* Elvis to appear in *Rebel Satellite* — a space musical directed by Nicholas Ray. The plot? A rock band accidentally launches themselves into orbit and discovers the remains of an abandoned lunar colony labeled “Property of the United States, 1932.”  
* Hepburn and Gregory Peck rumored to reunite for *The Still Garden* sequel, *The Silent Orchard*, set in a society that communicates only through music.  

Hollywood’s favorite new word is “weightless.”

# AMERICANA: WEIRD AND WONDERFUL

* In Phoenix, Arizona, a retired Formiscist engineer unveiled the first “personal flight suit”, promising “civilian levitation within five years.” The press calls it a hoax; Elvis wants one anyway.  
* The city of Seattle declared April 1st “Day of Imagination,” mandating all schools hold “creative play hours” — an idea adapted from a preschool curriculum once banned for “individualist tendencies.”  
* A record number of citizens report “cosmic dreams” — vivid visions of orbiting cities, crystal hives, and “voices from the upper atmosphere.” The Bureau of Health has declined to investigate.  
* ""King of Comedy"" Jerry Lewis opens show with ""King of Cool"" Dean Lewis sporting all-pink flashy garments and a giant plastic sword, declaring himself ""King of the Galaxy"".

# EDITORIAL: “AFTER ORDER, WONDER”

No one knows what comes next. America is dizzy with freedom — half in love with the stars, half afraid of the fall. But perhaps that’s the point.

We’ve built monuments to efficiency, and they crumbled. We silenced beauty, and it grew teeth. Now, from the ruins, rises a stranger, softer kind of nation — one that dreams of galaxies instead of governments.

As one young fan scrawled outside the Revue offices last night, in glitter paint and defiance:

“We were told to work like ants. Now we dance like comets.”  


# PART IV: “CAPITOL CONFIDENTIAL — POWER, SCANDAL, AND THE POST-FORMICIST HANGOVER”

*By Rex Waverly, Senior Political Correspondent*

# “IS HE TOO OLD FOR THE STARS?” — PRESIDENT SEASONGOOD FACES THE CLOCK

Washington whispers are getting louder: at 87, President **Murray Seasongood** may be America’s oldest optimist.  
His sweeping “Restoration Agenda” is adored by centrists but lampooned by the young press corps as *“governing by grandfather clock.”*

During his last televised address, the President briefly lost his train of thought while quoting Emerson — and the clip looped endlessly on late-night shows, one comedian dubbing it *“The Pause Heard Around the Nation.”*  
  
Insiders claim he tires quickly and delegates most foreign policy to Secretary of State J. William Fulbright, who has quietly become the de facto architect of the administration’s space and peace programs. Reports say that President Seasongood and Secretary Fulbright have crafted a close personal relationship, despite them hailing from two significantly different political factions. 

Still, Seasongood’s approval remains buoyed by nostalgia — he’s seen as the man who “brought daylight back after the Haskins Eclipse.”  
But as one aide told *Revue* under promise of anonymity:

“Daylight fades, even for the sunniest man.”

[At 88, President Seasongood has certainly seen better days.](https://preview.redd.it/zq71kwvmi0zf1.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=365fe7412cc660ff1907cdeaff1c3e388197753d)

# THE LAROUCHE ORACLE: FROM PROHIBITION TO PROPHECY

Representative Lyndon LaRouche, the self-proclaimed “Prohibitionist Prophet,” continues his campaign against what he calls “The Eco-Conspiracy.”  
  
In a marathon speech lasting nearly seven hours, he claimed that environmentalism is “a pagan cult engineered by Hellenic usurpers and secret financiers to dethrone man as the image of God.”

LaRouche’s fixation on “secret cabals” has alarmed colleagues, though his baroque oratory — peppered with Latin declamations and references to *Plato’s Republic* — has earned him cult-like devotion among a small but loud faction of populists who call themselves *The Athenian League.* 

Last week, the Congressman introduced a bill banning the teaching of ecology in public schools, calling it “antithetical to civic virtue.”  
The bill is unlikely to pass, but it has sparked what one journalist dubbed *“America’s strangest culture war.”*

[Representative La Rouche always was one of Washington's most colorful politicians.](https://preview.redd.it/2yqei7xyi0zf1.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ad74f90387ff05e657bf5deeb3390d7be5da933)

# CAPITOL GOSSIP: POWELL’S TROUBLED ALLY

A political thunderclap hit the capital’s social circuit this month when Representative Roy Cohn accused Mrs. Yvette Powell, wife of Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., of accepting “foreign luxury gifts” in exchange for “favorable moral advocacy” in Harlem redevelopment projects.

Cohn claims he has “photostatic proof” — though none has surfaced — and insiders believe it’s less about corruption and more about Cohn’s vendetta against Powell’s growing influence in President Seasongood’s coalition. Observers have speculated Mr. Powell Jr. would experience a dramatic fall from grace if these accusations were true, as many have seen him as a rising star in the Seasongood camp.

Powell Jr., known for his fiery charisma, support for President Seasongood, and impeccable suits, has dismissed the charge as “gutter theatrics from a man allergic to sunlight.”  
Yvette Powell, in turn, has become a symbol of defiant grace — photographed this week leaving a congressional luncheon in a silver gown, telling reporters,

“A woman’s success will always be called scandal by those who fear it.""

[Representation Powell has been described as quite the charismatic figure.](https://preview.redd.it/88ssalj6j0zf1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a07b9d5cd7a1870269b672b64d53b33160db697)

# THE BOBBY BAKER AFFAIR: SEX, BRIBES, AND A TELEVISED TRIAL

The nation can’t look away from the ongoing trial of Bobby Baker, former Senate aide and Washington’s best-connected “fixer.”

Charged with bribery, influence peddling, and arranging sexual favors for legislators in exchange for defense contracts, Baker’s downfall reads like a pulp thriller. His secret “hospitality suite,” reportedly stocked with bourbon and hidden cameras, has become the talk of every D.C. salon.

Rumor says Baker kept a little red ledger titled “The Hive Book” — a jab at the Formiscist slogan *“All work belongs to the hive.”*  
If true, it may reveal names the capital would rather stay buried.

Networks are scrambling to secure rights for a televised dramatization; CBS is reportedly negotiating with Jack Lemmon to play Baker.

[Mr. Baker's scandal has gone sensational.](https://preview.redd.it/79t4wwshj0zf1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2628ac8a2082341320b3ada584617aab3f4e69)

# THE RETURN OF THE HIVE? THE “NEO-FORMICISTS” TAKE THE STAGE

While the government dismantles the last of the Formicist propaganda remnants, a strange mutation has emerged: Neo-Formicism.  
Led by biologist and author Paul R. Ehrlich, this new “intellectual reform movement” claims to “extract the rational order from the moral rot” of the old regime.

Ehrlich’s upcoming book, *The Perfect Colony*, argues that “Formiscism was not wrong in seeing harmony in cooperation, only in punishing dissent.”  
His followers — many of them young academics disillusioned with postwar consumerism — meet in what they call “Collective Cafés,” where they discuss “evolutionary ethics” over espresso.

Critics, however, warn that it’s a sanitized gateway to authoritarian nostalgia. One newspaper columnist called it *“totalitarianism with a conscience.”*  
The White House remains publicly silent, though a leaked memo suggests President Seasongood privately calls Ehrlich “a dangerous idealist with a microscope.”

[With Neo-Formicism being formed, Mr. Ehrlich leads as one of its central developers.](https://preview.redd.it/jenvgn6nk0zf1.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=008fff15c659ced5f8625e639628d72b73abf694)

**JOSEPH HANSEN’S RADICAL ROADSHOW**

On the other side of the spectrum, former Popular Front leader Joseph Hansen has returned from his defeat in the 1964 presidential election with renewed fire.  
His *Freedom Vanguard Tour* has drawn thousands of students and workers, calling for “an America built on cooperative radicalism, not capitalist pacifism.”

His slogans — *“No Masters, No Hives, No Presidents”* — appear spray-painted on college walls from Berkeley to Boston.  
Despite being banned from national television, Hansen’s speeches circulate via underground recordings called “Red Reels.”

One reel, played during a protest at Columbia University, included Hansen’s voice declaring:

“Seasongood freed us from the ants, but he left us the anthill.”

The Secret Service reportedly monitors Hansen’s followers, labeling them *“nonviolent subversives.”*

[Representative Hansen continued on his crusade against capitalism.](https://preview.redd.it/a1cxgpgvk0zf1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b91fa28d78ca1b73cc5f7dbc9b6004246af1951)

# AND IN OTHER RUMORS…

* Vice President Berenberg is rumored to be quietly preparing a succession plan should the President step down for health reasons. His staff denies it, but his schedule of private “defense coordination meetings” grows suspiciously dense.  
* Winthrop Rockefeller, the reclusive tycoon, is said to be bankrolling Project Eden, the alleged orbital colony effort. He’s reportedly purchased exclusive rights to all titanium shipments out of Nevada.  
* Senator Barry Goldwater, long presumed politically dead, was spotted dining with Air Force officials and discussing “private satellite security.” No one knows what that means — yet.  
* A mysterious pamphlet titled “The Queen Lives” appeared in several Los Angeles cafés last week, bearing a picture of Monroe surrounded by bees. Authorities suspect Neo-Formicist pranksters.  



# EDITORIAL: “THE COST OF DAWN”

For all its glitter, post-Formicist America remains haunted by its own reflection.  
A nation once ruled by the creed of the ant now feasts on the scandal of the man.  
 We whisper of corruption, faith, and betrayal not because they are new — but because, after decades of silence, we finally can.

Maybe this is what freedom sounds like: messy, rumor-filled, and gloriously human.

“The hive is gone,” wrote columnist Clare Boothe Luce last week.  
“But the buzz remains.”

# “FROM THE HIVE TO HOLLYWOOD” — NEWLY UNSEALED SECRETS FROM THE ARCHIVES

The *National Archive of Civic Purity* released another batch of declassified documents this week, exposing just how strange life was under the Haskins-Weber years:

* A memo reveals that Caryl Parker Haskins personally approved a project to broadcast “behavioral harmonics” through radio jingles — including one suspiciously similar to the old Lucky Strike jingle.  
* A 1959 propaganda cartoon titled *The Little Worker Who Cried* was found locked in a vault. Disney animators now claim it was *commissioned under duress*; it depicts an ant colony executing a lazy grasshopper.  
* Records suggest the “Worker’s Food Plan” once mandated *standardized chewing rhythm* in public cafeterias. (Editor’s note: “Try enforcing that in Brooklyn.”)  
* One unverified report lists Elvis Presley as a “potential dissident influencer,” citing “unnatural hip oscillations.” (Editor’s note: “Are they serious?”)  



# STUDIO WHISPERS & CELLULOID RUMORS

**DISNEY’S TOMORROWDOMES:**  
Walt Disney himself unveiled plans for “Tomorrowdomes” — sealed entertainment pavilions meant to “simulate the first Martian cities.” The first is set to open in Orlando by 1970 within the greater ""Tommorowland"" area. The government quietly offered “consultation.”

**COLUMBIA CONFIDENTIAL:**  
A *Revue* source says Stanley Kubrick demanded an actual space capsule for his new production *2001: A Space Requiem*, a direct sequel to his coming *2001: A Space Odyssey*. He allegedly told engineers, “If NASA won’t lend me the moon, I’ll build a better one.”

**PARAMOUNT PLANS A MUSICAL OF HISTORY:**  
Rumor has it that Rodgers and Hammerstein (yes, still collaborating through letters) are developing *“We the People: An American Opera”*, tracing the nation from the Revolution to the Reformation — the fall of Formiscism included. Early lyrics leak:

“We marched in lines / till lines became chains / now we’ll waltz again / in the dust of our pains.”

**AND OVER AT MGM…**  
A remake of *It’s a Wonderful Life* is underway — rewritten to imagine a man who *did* live under the Formiscists and wakes up in 1966 to find the world free. Cary Grant may star; Frank Capra Jr. will direct.

Quick story time and a cry for help lol,"I have been messing with TikTok Shop since the summer. First, I tried random stuff, then I switched to simple creator-style TikTok merch like hoodies with short, punchy text and cute phone cases. The content side is fine. I can get views if I go hard on daily short clips. But when I flip to live shopping, I get people hanging out and commenting, but not clicking buy. Live peaks around 80 to 120 viewers on a good night, then drops when I pitch the offer. My conversion on lives is like 0.5 percent. On regular shoppable vids, it is a bit better, but still meh

How do you structure the live? I have tried a timer, I have tried a tiny wheel of prizes, and I have tried limited stock, only ten left tactics. People still vibe, but do not buy

Long story:
I have a Yamaha YTX 125, it's a very cheap motorcycle from yamaha. it's all analog with CDI, drum brakes front and back, etc. I changed the speedometer to a digital one, added Mini driving lights,USB charger,  and voltmeter to check the battery voltage which is around 14v. I also connected the turn signal into my mini driving light which has a ""parking light"" which acts as my turn signals. It's working fine and all but I want to change the stock handle bar to a longer one. because of this i need to extend the wires and cables. I got pretty impatient and excited and disconnected all the wires and cables and set the new handle bar. 

Now here is the start of the problem, since I impatiently disconnected the wires I forgot to label them. I even remove their plugs to save space in the headlight housing since all wires are just tucked there. I spent hours figuring out which wire is for which and I manage to make the thing turn ON and run.

Here is my problem. The bike starts and runs, but my voltmeter which is parallel with my usb charger and power for the digital speedometer shows only an IDLE voltage of 10.6v and a RUNNING voltage of around 12.6v. since my turn signal is LED it doesn't turn on when im on IDLE. the worst part is that I noticed that the battery is getting hot, too hot to uncomfortably hold. it's like holding a coffee in a mug, you can hold it but it's uncomfortable.

Can I get your suggestions on what and how to check, specially on the wiring, and what do I need to do to have it properly wired? 

Here are some info that may help.
1) The motorcycle is Yamaha YTX 125
2) The only wires I disconnected are for:
- Left handle switch(turn signals, horn, passing light, low and high beam)
- Clutch lever switch
- Right handle switch(push start switch)
- USB charger
- Voltmeter
- Brake lever switch
- Entire universal digital speedometer
- Wires from motorcycle harness(turn signal, Old Speedometer wires)
- Ignition wires
3) All functions are working
4) Manually checking the battery voltage using a multimeter shows around 13v
5) The only problem is the voltage and battery heating

My first guess is that I have a short somewhere that is why my battery is getting hot but I don't know how to check and find that.

1onclly,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1onclly/rf_the_price_of_the_ticket_feedback_please/,[RF] The Price Of The Ticket (feedback please?),"By the time the train slid out of Manchester Central, I could no longer tell where the city ended and the screen began. The last of the glass towers flashed by like a closing advertisement—another digital colossus selling futures none of us dare dream afford—and then the countryside arrived, polite and curated, piped through the window’s smart display system. Out there, I knew, was a scatter of wind farms and derelict terraces, but what we saw was the state’s projection: rolling green serenity, cows grazing as if debt-free. It was 2040, and even the landscape was a lie.

I’d just filed my report on the North Premier Super League fixture—CityLink United versus Amazon Albion—and felt no satisfaction. There’d been four goals, all reviewed and authorised by the Predictive Fairness Algorithm, yet nothing remotely human. The players were the same genetically enhanced specimens that filled every broadcast feed: flawless, indistinguishable, sustained by nanotherapy and sponsorship clauses that outlawed fatigue. Their smiles were rehearsed; their tackles risk-free. The terraces, once the pulsing heart of northern cities, had been replaced by spectator pods—hermetically sealed cells where viewers watched on a wall-sized screen with pre-approved chants piped in via neural headset.

And me? I was there to write “colour.” But colour had gone the way of dissent.

I switched off my pad and stared through the shimmering projection of fields. Somewhere in the static of memory, I could still hear the old grounds: the raw bellow of a working man who’d paid a tenner to forget the week’s humiliation, the rattle of plastic seats, the electricity of a match that might turn savage or sublime without warning. Those were the days when a game could make or break your mood for a month. Now, the crowd’s reactions were market-tested; a half-time advert could tell you exactly how to feel.

I’d been on the circuit too long to pretend it was only the sport that had changed. The eradication of the working class had begun as a slogan—“Levelling for Progress”—but in truth it was an extermination by credit rating. The poor had simply been priced out of existence. The state had no need for builders or binmen when drones could do it all without complaint. Those who couldn’t “transition to digital competency” were quietly relocated to “Rural Reassignment Zones.” No one knew what happened there. Some said they’d been given land. Others whispered of mass re-education camps hidden beyond the old industrial belts. All I knew was that every year there were fewer familiar faces in the press rooms, fewer voices with the accent of the terraces.

I was heading south to cover the big one: the Global Heavyweight Showcase at the Barclays Arena, London Sector 1. Two men, both unbeaten, both algorithmically approved for maximum market compatibility. The bout was the first to be sanctioned by BetLife, the new AI bookmaker that allowed punters to stake their own life expectancy on the result. Lose badly enough, and your biometric licence would deactivate. Heart stopped. Account closed. “Risk adds thrill,” the slogan went. The government claimed no involvement and the death rate was deemed “negligible.”

A steward came down the aisle, his uniform impossibly crisp. “Travel ID, please.”

I flashed my card; it glowed blue. “Press,” I said, out of habit.

He scanned the chip and frowned. “You’re one point off premium clearance. You’ll need a social refresh before entering the capital.”

“I’m just covering the fight.”

He gave me the kind of look reserved for anyone still using verbs like covering. “Understood, sir. You’ll find refresh pods in carriage seven.”

He moved on, leaving me to my thoughts and the low hum of the train’s conscience.

social refresh. Once, we used to worry about missing deadlines; now, a journalist could be barred from cities for insufficient positivity. The algorithm measured it all—tone, compliance, enthusiasm. Write too bleakly about a game and your score dropped. Criticise policy and your access revoked. The great columnists of the past would have lasted a week. The great writers of a past era would have been flagged as “emotionally subversive” before the second paragraph.

I rose and made my way through the carriages. Most passengers were watching the match replay on their visors, re-living a pre-approved highlight reel where no foul or fury could intrude. In the refresh pod, I inserted the neural key and waited. A soothing female voice asked: “Would you like to affirm today’s positive experiences?”

“Not especially.”

“Negative response detected. Please restate.”

I sighed. “Fine. The football was… efficient.”

A pause. Then the voice softened. “You may proceed.”

When I emerged, my card glowed green again. The machine had done its work. I was re-admitted to the human race.

The Hyperlink coasted into London without a shudder. Outside, the skyline had become a vertical farm of privilege: glass towers fed by invisible pipelines of data and energy, guarded by drones that pulsed how the wasps used to. The streets beneath were empty, except for delivery bots humming between neon shopfronts. Advertising drones painted the air with holographic slogans: BetLife Tonight — One Will Fall. Maybe You.

I took the metro to the arena. Along the way, I passed a mural of the last “organic” heavyweight champion—a thick-necked brute from Liverpool who’d refused gene therapy and died in a warehouse brawl. The mural had been digitised now; passers-by could swipe for a subscription. Everything had a price tag, especially nostalgia.

Outside the arena, a queue moved polite and orderly, every spectator required to pass a biometric gate. Above each turnstile, a display showed your Social Score. Those below 600 were diverted to the Viewing Zone—an outdoor enclosure where you could watch on a giant screen if you agreed to real-time mood monitoring. Those above 800 entered through gold-lit doors into the air-conditioned sanctum where champagne flowed and drones hovered with hors d’oeuvres. I was on 702—enough for the press tier, but only just.

Inside, the place was blinding. Every seat had a screen, every aisle a sponsor. There was no smell of sweat, no sound of struggle, only the antiseptic buzz of commerce. I took my place among the accredited scribes—most of them virtual avatars operated by media AIs. A few real faces remained: old men with hollow eyes, women who typed out of muscle memory. We’d once been the conscience of sport. Now we were its stenographers.

The undercard flickered by like an assembly line. Each fight lasted precisely the number of rounds predicted by BetLife’s odds. No one cheered. The crowd responded only when prompted by the Emotion Cue lights that pulsed around the ring: blue for awe, red for excitement, gold for victory. We’d become extras in a simulation of passion.

Between bouts, I checked my pad. My article from Manchester had already been auto-edited by the paper’s compliance software. The headline now read: CityLink’s Triumph Highlights National Efficiency. Every trace of my criticism—the sterile crowd, the lifeless play—had been rewritten into celebration. The byline still carried my name, but I barely recognised the man beneath it.

I ordered a coffee—£18, soy-based, ethically neutral—and waited for the main event.

The fighters entered to orchestral drones and AI-composed anthems. In one corner stood Max Titan, a government prototype marketed as “The Pride of Progress.” In the other, Ezekiel Rhodes, an ex-miner’s grandson from one of the few remaining “Heritage Zones.” The official story said Rhodes had been discovered on an old underground circuit, where the dispossessed fought for food tokens. His following among the poor made him dangerous—a populist, the pundits whispered—but the authorities had packaged him in the classic underdog narrative, a throwback to sell pay-per-view to the masses.

As the bell rang, I felt a shiver of something dangerously close to excitement. Rhodes moved with the rugged rhythm of an old fighter—awkward and unpredictable. Titan, by contrast, was pure design: his movements pre-calculated to minimise risk and maximise spectacle. In the first round, Rhodes landed a right hand that wasn’t supposed to connect. Titan staggered. The crowd gasped—unprompted, un-programmed. For a moment, chaos returned.

Then I saw the BetLife feed flicker. Across the screens, odds spasmed. Millions of life-credits swung between victory and death. Somewhere, out there, a poor man’s heart must have skipped as the algorithm recalculated his lifespan.

By the third round, the fix was visible. Titan’s gloves glowed faintly—a microcharge pulsing beneath the leather. Every punch he threw hummed with precision. Rhodes kept swinging, but the air seemed to repel his blows. When Titan landed a left hook, Rhodes fell like a man unmade.

The referee didn’t count. He looked up, waiting for the BetLife confirmation. Across the arena, the screen blinked red: BetLife Decision: Rhodes — LOSS VERIFIED. CONTRACT EXECUTION IMMINENT.

For a moment, I thought it was another gimmick. Then the drone descended. A small, black sphere, humming with authority. It hovered above Rhodes’s body, scanned his iris, and emitted a brief, almost polite flash. When it lifted, he was gone.

No one screamed. The crowd, dulled by years of conditioning, applauded the spectacle as if it were a special effect. Titan raised his arms, the national anthem played, and the Emotion Cue lights turned gold.

I sat frozen, notebook untouched. In that instant, I knew we’d reached the end of the old bargain. Sport had once been a mirror of society’s struggles, a place where working men could dream of grace. Now it was the regime’s theatre of euthanasia—discipline disguised as entertainment.

The press feed buzzed. All journalists please submit positive coverage within the next ten minutes to validate access credits.

I looked at the screen, at the words I was supposed to type: Titan’s Victory Showcases BetLife’s Transparency. My fingers hovered. Around me, the avatars were already filing their immaculate prose. I felt the weight of my pass, my card glowing faintly on the table. Green, for now.

Then I wrote the truth. Every word of it. About the drone, the death, the crowd’s indifference. About how the sport had been sterilised into fascism with a marketing budget. I filed it, knowing what it meant.

The system reacted immediately. My pad blinked red: Non-compliant submission detected. Social score adjustment in progress. I stood, heart pounding, and made for the exit. But the arena’s glass doors had sealed. My card had turned black.

A voice came through the intercom, calm as a weather report. “Thank you for your contribution to national discourse. Please remain seated for your feedback resolution.”

I ran. Down the corridor, past the holographic adverts, into the concourse where the crowd still basked in the afterglow of authorised emotion. Drones tracked me overhead. I reached the street, gasping, and saw the skyline burning gold in the distance. Somewhere, the train back north would be leaving. I thought of the terraces, the chants, the men who’d once shouted themselves hoarse for pride that cost a fiver and could feed a soul for days.

My wristband buzzed. Final Warning: Termination Pending.

I ducked into an alley. The city was quiet here, almost human. Posters peeled from walls: old fight bills, forgotten faces. I tore one down and stared at the image—two men mid-punch, sweat flying, their expressions fierce and alive. For the first time in years, I wept.

A shadow fell across me. The same drone, its lens fixed, patient. “Please remain still,” it said.

I looked straight into it. “He was a fighter,” I said. “You can’t digitise that.”

The light pulsed once, a brief, clinical mercy.

They’ll say I died for non-compliance. They’ll tidy my name from the archives, adjust the feed to suggest I’d retired or relocated. The paper will run my obituary as an act of algorithmic compassion. But somewhere, maybe in the forgotten zones beyond the wind farms, a few will remember that there was once a journalist who tried to write the truth about the games we played.

I hope they keep playing, even in secret.I hope they remember the roar that used to lift the sky.

And if they ever rebuild the old grounds, if they ever lace gloves in a cold gym for the sheer, stubborn love of it, maybe they’ll raise a glass for the vanished class that once made sport human.

Because in the end, that’s what they killed. Not the losers, not the fighters. Us. The crowd. The voice. The bloody pulse that made it all worth watching.

1oncl1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1oncl1r/would_like_suggestions_with_teeth_anxiety/,would like suggestions with teeth (anxiety),"hi all,

I noticed some gum recession on a couple of teeth, also recently, some very minor tooth sensitivity; I think this was due to overbrushing my gums with a regular toothbrush for 3-4 years. I am in my early 20s, dont drink, smoke, drugs, etc. 

I have now started gentle brushing with soft bristles using an electric toothbrush 2x a day after breakfast, Listerine alcohol free mouthwash before eating breakfast, floss after dinner, and waterpik after each meal. I also wait 30 minutes before brushing after breakfast and dinners. I’ve also been drinking coffee with a metal straw and avoiding acidic/sweet foods and trying xylitol gum.

I have three questions: 

1. do I need to go see a periodontist?
   1. If so, are initial consultations free or how much does it cost with insurance in California?
2. What are some other ways I can prevent gum recession?

It’s been causing me some anxiety - so I would love to have some reassurance that the plan forward is correct.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

But I don't know about the other guys, but if I want something for my birthday, I tend to buy it myself. What I mean by that, I never thought of someone giving me something for my birthday.

1onchsr,https://www.politico.eu/article/us-accused-threats-eu-diplomats-bid-to-kill-green-shipping-rules-negotiations-personal-intimidation/,US accused of threatening EU diplomats during bid to kill green shipping rules,"European negotiators were personally targeted by their American counterparts during a brutal negotiation over green shipping rules, European Commission officials told POLITICO — a highly unusual gambit that left diplomats shaken after the meeting. 

The threats were made last month, as the U.S. maneuvered to block a new effort to tax pollution at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization in London.

Eight envoys, officials and civil society observers from Europe, granted anonymity to describe the fractious closed-door discussions and protect their relationships with those involved, confirmed national delegates had reported they had been threatened with personal consequences if they went against Washington.

“Our negotiators had never seen this before in any international talks,” said one European official, who had spoken to negotiators. “People being summoned to the U.S. Embassy in London — intimidation, threats of cessation of business, threats of family members losing visas.”

Another European Commission official added that diplomats returned home rattled after the meetings: “We had feedback from a number of people involved in the negotiations about the pressure they faced.”

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, the administration has sought to undermine global climate policy and promote U.S. fossil fuel interests. The president has called efforts to combat global warming a “con job.” He was particularly enraged about the maritime emissions effort, saying it would hit American shippers with unwarranted taxes.

The U.S. strategy was laid out publicly ahead of the meeting, with a press release signed by the U.S. secretaries of state, transportation and energy. On top of threats of tariffs, port fees and visa restrictions on crews, the U.S. said it would also look at “sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.”

Only two EU members broke from the bloc: major maritime countries Cyprus and Greece, with the latter claiming its choice had nothing to do with U.S. pressure.

The deployment of personal threats in an international negotiation represents another departure by the Trump administration from diplomatic norms and signals further tension in relations between the U.S. and EU.

The threats were not limited to European delegations, according to officials and attendees briefed on the events in London.

Delegates exposed to the intimidation campaign were unwilling to speak on the record for fear the U.S. would make good on its ultimatums. The Financial Times first reported the personal threats to delegates.

In a close vote, the summit chose to delay the emissions tax for a year — a feat viewed by many as a near-death blow to the measure and a major victory for Trump. Dozens of countries from Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia agreed to the delay.

Other officials who spoke to the delegates said they were astonished at how strongly the Americans were prepared to pressure delegations.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had personally called more than 20 countries to pressure them. A senior Western diplomat confirmed the U.S. threatened Caribbean countries with tariffs if they did not agree to postpone the shipping emissions decision.

During the week-long IMO meeting, the “process was ongoing,” said the observer. In at least one case U.S delegates approached another delegation on the floor of the plenary and issued a similar set of ultimatums. “There was quite a bit of upset among the delegates.” 

At a coffee break during the meeting, Vanuatu Climate Minister Ralph Regenvanu told POLITICO that other island nations had been subjected to “relentless pressure” from the U.S.. “There’s bullshit going on,” he said.

Although tough tactics are nothing new in international talks, the bare-knuckle approach of the U.S. in London was seen as extraordinary.

“U.S. pressure created an atmosphere of fear, which in turn created chaos that ultimately led to the adoption to be delayed,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in climate and maritime transport policies at the University of Melbourne, who was present at the talks in an observer capacity.

""Once you go around threatening countries, you undermine the design and functioning of multilateralism as it emerged since the Second World War,” he added.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment on what they called “private diplomatic conversations.” But in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the effort against the carbon price.

“Our coalition-building efforts paid off, proving that real diplomacy based on national interest — ours and theirs — can thwart unaccountable bureaucratic schemes. Should this initiative or any other similar one emerge from the U.N. bureaucracy again, our coalition against it will be ready—and larger,” said Rubio.",1,1762178409.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,1,1.0,False

I've been a silent follower and upvoter of the community for some time, here my first post.

I have just created a tool that overlaps maps, that serves to compare custom areas i.e. two neighbourhoods, countries with their real sizes,... and wanted to share it with you, as geography lovers, you might have some interest in playing with it. [www.mapoverlap.com](http://www.mapoverlap.com)

Feel free to use it!

A bit of the story on why I created the tool:

\---

I have recently moved to Barcelona, and I was discussing with some friends the feeling of the city compared to Madrid. I was telling them that I found the centre being quite large and dense, with many different areas to explore. They argued that Madrid was much larger.

I was defending that Madrid, as a metropolis, it might be larger, but the size of the centric area should be similar. By centric I mean the area where a newcomer would like to live in, in order to feel the vibrancy of the city. Basically, for me, what lays within the M-30 road in Madrid. And in the case of Barcelona, what lays in between the Collserola natural park and the sea in Barcelona, excluding Sta Coloma de Gramanet and L'hospitalet. (I know the rest might be very livable! I'm talking from the viewpoint of someone coming to enjoy the big city).

\---

From these conversations, I started creating a tool to overlap maps and compare sizes of areas of countries. Even though there might be tools that would calculate this for me (for example Google Earth has area calculator) but I wanted to craft something as a personal project to make it custom to what I wanted.

It turned out to be a fun project, and here (plus in the comments) some results

Note: Hopefully it doesn't get discarded as self-promoting post as I don't do it in a lucrative way, but rather sharing as an interesting tool. It's free use!

I noticed some gum recession on a couple of teeth, also recently, some very minor tooth sensitivity; I think this was due to overbrushing my gums with a regular toothbrush for 4 years.

I have now started gentle brushing with soft bristles using an electric toothbrush 2x a day, mouthwash before eating, floss after dinner, and waterpik after each meal. I also wait 30 minutes before brushing after breakfast and dinners. I’ve also been drinking coffee with a metal straw and avoiding acidic/sweet foods.

I have three questions: 

1. I just wanted to ask, if I need to go see a periodontist? If so, are initial consultations free or how much does it cost with insurance?
2. What are some other ways I can prevent gum recession?

She rolled her eyes and whispered to another coworker, “Petty much?”

Right now we've got that money divided up with names, new car, vacation, electronic replacement (phones, computer, tablets, etc), kitchen replace (blender, food processor, microwave, coffee maker, crock-pot, etc etc) outdoor replacement (grill, mower, chainsaw, blower, etc etc) 

Obviously if there was a job loss we would just raid all of those lines but keeping them separate helps me see that money is available when something small breaks 

I was curious if anybody else used a similar system or could help me make some minor improvements to it... I feel like keeping enough money to individually replace all of those is probably excessive, but it's basically a full sinking fund, if I project something to last 5 years and I put 20% of the money into it each year it fills up but I'll keep using the thing until it actually breaks 

Do you all calculate the lifespan of that stuff divided up and save the money, do you round some fraction of the replacement cost of everything all together and just save it every year like a person might save a couple percentage of the value of the house set aside for maintenance? 

How do you balance stuff like mowers and cars and appliances which will be immediately repaired or replaced if broken versus stuff that can be delayed, like a person won't replace all of their linens at once some of it will he tossed and then some more will be tossed and then at that point everything is replaced

1oncc7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMCareers/comments/1oncc7t/my_honest_prepcast_experience_with_pmiacp_exam/,My Honest PrepCast Experience with PMI-ACP Exam Simulator,"I am happy to share that I passed the PMI-ACP exam on my first attempt on October 22, 2025, with results of AT/AT/T/T. PrepCast played a major role in my success, but my experience with it was bittersweet. Here is why.

Before purchasing the simulator, I did a lot of online research. Most reviews were positive, but many users mentioned that the PrepCast questions were very difficult and that the simulator sometimes crashed their confidence. I thought: that won’t be a problem for me — I’ve done dozens of mock exams and usually score 70–75%. So, I went ahead and bought it, ready for a challenge. Well… the journey turned out to be much tougher than I expected.

My First Impressions

I started with the Premium Quizzes feature, which I found very practical. You can choose short sets of 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 questions, perfect for quick study sessions during coffee breaks, at train stations, or even while waiting in line at the grocery store. I chose not to include “exam” questions in my quizzes so I could save those for full-length mock exams later.

However, to my surprise, I was getting more wrong answers than I expected. At first, I ignored it, but over time it started to bother me. My confidence dropped sharply, even though I had already studied thousands of questions and multiple PMI-ACP books.

At one point, I was so frustrated that I considered quitting. I even thought of writing a review titled: Do you really have to make the questions this difficult?

Changing My Strategy

After taking a one-day break, I looked up more reviews. Again, most people said the same thing: PrepCast is tough, but worth it.

That gave me hope. I decided to continue, but this time with a new approach. After every quiz, I started reading every single question, answer choice, and explanation, carefully analyzing why each option was correct or wrong. I did this even for the questions I got right.

This turned out to be a game-changer. It was no longer just about testing my knowledge, it became another layer of learning.

I refused to take the next quiz until I had fully reviewed all the explanations from the previous one. Gradually, my understanding deepened, and my quiz scores started improving.

After finishing all the quiz questions, I retook them, this time focusing only on the ones I had answered incorrectly. (The system allows you to do that, which is great.)

Full Mock Exams

Then came the full-length mock exams. My scores were: 65%, 66.7%, and 66.7%. Not exactly high, right. But I didn’t panic, and here’s why.

Scoring: PMI vs. PrepCast

PMI uses a psychometric scoring model, not a fixed passing score. Your result depends on the difficulty level of the questions you answer correctly.

PrepCast, like most simulators, uses a simple percentage-based system. Based on my research and discussions with others, I believe you can add about 4–6 percentage points to your PrepCast mock scores to estimate your real PMI exam performance. That’s just my theory,  take it as you wish, but it matched my experience pretty well.

The Key is Mindset.

The most important factor in passing PMI exams is your mindset. PMI exams do not test memorization, they test how you think. You will never see identical questions, even if they look similar. I have taken several PMI exams and practiced over 10,000 questions  and I have never seen two that were the [same.So](http://same.So), focus on building the right mindset, not chasing high mock exam scores.

Final Thoughts

Even though my PrepCast experience was challenging and sometimes discouraging, I strongly recommend it.

Are there easier simulators out there? Probably. But PrepCast was, in my opinion, the best tool to truly prepare me for the real PMI-ACP exam. It forced me to think like PMI wants you to think and that made all the difference.

As for the PMI-ACP exam itself; yes, it was tough. In fact, some questions were harder than PrepCast’s. But if you build a strong mindset through deep understanding, you wiil be fine, no matter what your mock test scores say.

So, do not let PrepCast’s difficulty discourage [you.Read](http://you.Read) the explanations carefully, learn from every mistake, and treat every question as an opportunity to think deeper. Over time, you will notice yourself improving and when exam day comes, you will be ready.",1,1762178025.0,PMCareers,1,1.0,False

1oncald,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oncald,First Nevermo wedding (+ lifelong dream),"This weekend, as a woman in my mid-30s, I attended my first EVER fully Nevermo wedding and in the process, fulfilled a long-held and personal dream. 

I grew up outside Morridor, in a state with a high temp and humidity climate. 95% of my friends were Nevermos. I was constantly exposed to and surrounded by shoulders and stomachs and high hems. Bikinis at the lake and thigh-high slits for prom. My friends were all so beautiful. And I was always so bummed I couldn’t embrace those same things, bask in that same kind beauty. I didn’t believe showing skin was wrong or immoral or immodest. Not for them. I simply (and erroneously) believed I was held to a higher standard. Therefore, I couldn’t participate. I had to cover up. Because I’d been told to. Because I believed such sacrificial acts of obedience were spiritual tools meant to bring me closer to Christ and prepare me for eternal salvation. 

Since leaving the church early 2024, I’ve done many of the traditional baby-exmo things: coffee, swearing, alcohol, extra piercings, garment unfriendly clothing, etc etc. But this? I used to fucking dream about this. Wearing dresses like this inside venues like these where I could dance my fucking heart out and feel every bit as beautiful as I’ve always wanted to in clothes I’ve long since admired.  

Our weekend was spent with 200+ other people, cheering and dancing and loving on and celebrating our newly-married friends for a solid 48 hours straight. People flew in from not only all over the country, but all over the world. To celebrate NOW. TODAY. THESE EXACT MOMENTS. No subdued celebration in hopes for a brighter, more fulfilling eternity. No stuffy temple full of quiet restrictions and repressed sensations. There *was* a temple, but it teemed with color and music and loud laughter. Bare feet and cheeky games, where sacrality was bonded with a teasing charm. And I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed that my children were able to experience this. All of it. That they were able to witness THIS kind of love. THIS kind of joy. Leaving them with the grander knowledge that today is just as important as tomorrow and that the present is always worthy of celebration. 

As for my outfits: 

To all the women who want to wear the strapless dress, the tank top, the shorter shorts, the bikini set, but aren’t quite there yet—when you’re ready, I will be here, cheering you on. When you’re ready, I will celebrate with you. Because our bodies are ours and they are meant for us and us alone and no fucking decrepit old men pretending to speak for an apathetic and gluttonous god will ever again dictate the way forward in how we choose to glorify our ourselves, in whatever spheres we deem worthy of our patronage.

I used to buy huge online courses and never finish them. I’d get through two lessons, life would get busy, and I’d forget everything. Sound familiar? Then I discovered a better way.

[Top Microlearning Apps ](https://preview.redd.it/b34wn2alr1zf1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=975b314334049e5dd45020ad8c0f8c3af969acb5)

It’s called microlearning. Instead of hour-long classes, you learn in tiny, bite-sized pieces. Think of it like eating M&Ms instead of a whole giant cake. It’s easier, more fun, and you actually remember it. This is how people are learning new skills now. To help you get started, I’ve put together a list of the [**best microlearning apps for 2025**](https://www.biglivetrends.com/child-development-learning/best-microlearning-apps).

These are the apps that fit into your day, not the other way around.

# What is Microlearning, Anyway? (And Why You’ll Love It)

Let’s keep it simple. Microlearning is learning in small, focused chunks.

Imagine you want to learn how to fix a leaky faucet. You could read a giant plumbing textbook. Or, you could watch a two-minute video that shows you the exact steps. That video is microlearning. It gives you one piece of information, right when you need it.

Our brains love this. It’s less scary than a big course, and you’re more likely to stick with it. You can do a lesson while waiting for your coffee, standing in line, or during a TV commercial break.

My friend Tom used to say he had ""no time"" to learn Spanish. Now, he uses a microlearning app for five minutes each morning on the bus. After three months, he can already hold a basic conversation. It really works.

# What Makes a Great Microlearning Training App?

Not all learning apps are created equal. A great microlearning app feels like a helpful friend, not a strict teacher. Here’s what I looked for:

* **Short and Sweet:** Lessons should be five minutes or less.
* **Fun to Use:** It should feel like a game, not a chore.
* **Fits Your Life:** You can use it without clearing your schedule.
* **Actually Works:** It helps you remember what you learned.

Now, let’s get to the good stuff.

# The Best Microlearning Apps for 2025

Here are my top picks for apps that will help you learn something new this year.

# 1. Duolingo: The Game That Teaches You Languages

You’ve probably heard of the friendly (or persistent) green owl. Duolingo is the perfect example of a great microlearning app.

* **How it Works:** You spend about five minutes a day completing little language lessons. You match words, speak phrases, and unlock levels. It feels like playing a game.
* **Why It’s Great:** It’s incredibly fun and addictive. The short lessons make it easy to be consistent. You don’t have to think about ""studying,"" you just show up and play for a few minutes.
* **Best For:** Anyone who wants to start learning a new language without any pressure.

# 2. Blinkist: Big Ideas in Small Packages

What if you could read a full book in 15 minutes? That’s Blinkist’s promise. It takes the key ideas from thousands of non-fiction books and turns them into short ""blinks"" you can read or listen to.

* **How it Works:** You pick a book, and Blinkist gives you a series of short text or audio summaries that explain the main concepts.
* **Why It’s Great:** It’s a lifesaver for busy people. You can get the main points from a business or self-help book during your commute. It helps you learn a lot about many different topics very quickly.
* **Best For:** Curious people who love learning but don’t have time to read every book.

# 3. Quizlet: Flashcards on Steroids

Remember using paper flashcards in school? Quizlet is the modern, smarter version. It’s one of the most powerful **microlearning training app** tools out there.

* **How it Works:** You create digital flashcards with questions on one side and answers on the other. Then, Quizlet turns them into little games and tests to help you memorize the information.
* **Why It’s Great:** It’s perfect for memorizing anything—vocabulary, historical dates, scientific terms. You can also use flashcards made by millions of other users. It’s simple, fast, and extremely effective.
* **Best For:** Students or anyone who needs to memorize and recall information quickly.

# Finding a Blended Microlearning Solution

Sometimes, you need more than just an app. A **blended microlearning solution** mixes short, app-based lessons with other types of learning. This is common in companies where employees need to practice new skills.

For example, a sales team might use an app for daily 3-minute lessons on new product features. Then, once a week, they meet for a role-playing session to practice what they learned in the app. The app teaches the ""what,"" and the practice session reinforces the ""how.""

This blended approach is often the most effective way to make new skills stick.

# How to Pick the Right App for You

With so many options, how do you choose? Ask yourself these two questions:

1. **What do I actually want to learn?** Be specific. ""Get better at my job"" is vague. ""Learn basic Excel formulas"" is specific and much easier to find an app for.
2. **When will I use it?** If you know you’ll only ever use it during your lunch break, pick an app that works well for that.

The best app is the one you’ll actually open every day. Don’t be afraid to try a few. Most have free versions so you can see which one feels right.

# Your New Skills Are Waiting

You don’t need a lot of time to learn something new. You just need the right method. Microlearning takes the pressure off and makes building a new skill feel possible.

These apps are like having a pocket-sized tutor. They break down big, scary topics into tiny, manageable steps. Why not download one this week and try it for just five minutes a day? You might surprise yourself.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**What is microlearning in simple words?**  
It’s learning big things in very small pieces. Instead of sitting through a long class, you learn for just a few minutes at a time using an app on your phone. It’s like learning one new guitar chord each day instead of trying to learn a whole song at once.

**Is microlearning good for kids?**  
Yes, it’s great for kids! Their attention spans are often short. Microlearning apps that feel like games can help them learn math, spelling, or a new language without getting bored. It turns learning into a fun activity, not homework.

**How is microlearning different from a normal online course?**  
A normal online course is like a full meal—it can take an hour or more to finish. Microlearning is like a snack. It’s a five-minute lesson you can do anywhere. It’s easier to fit into a busy day and easier to remember.

**Are these microlearning apps free?**  
Most of the apps on this list have a free version that lets you do a lot. Sometimes, the free version has ads or limits how much you can learn each day. Paying for the full app usually removes these limits, but you can start learning without spending any money.

**Can I really learn a skill from my phone?**  
You absolutely can. You won’t become a brain surgeon from an app, but you can learn the basics of many useful things. You can learn new words in a language, how to code a simple website, or how to manage your money better. It’s a fantastic way to start.",1,1762177904.0,biglivetrends,0,1.0,False

1onc98k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1onc98k/night_of_fright/,Night of Fright...,"So ive struggled on an and off with this my whole life. I have learned triggers, warnings, and some control methods. 

 Last night however was very chilling... I struggled immensely to sleep, tossing and turning. Around 230AM, the ringing of my ears began, followed by the thundering sound that seems to resemble eardrums shaking.  I was so fatigued that I thought i would drift asleep and not be bothered with paralysis... wrong... the air grew cold, my body became covered in goosebumps and suddenly... it happened. The lighting in the room will always change without my noticing. Its instantaneous and always a different color. I have my living room dimly lit with christmas lights (insomnia) and usually fall asleep on couch early hours. When I realized I was in sleep paralysis, I began to hear plates and silverware in the kitchen being scuttled around loudly in the pitch black darkness, as if someone was doing dishes. Terrified, I ""stood up rapidly, and fell flat on my face stuck staring into the darkness of the kitchen""? I could feel an entity approaching, a precense of some sort coming from the kitchen. ""On the floor, I yelled HELP ME, HELP ME!!!! hoping the misses or son would hear and shake me out of it. No... as it grew closer I suddenly realized I was laying on the couch, starting at the ceiling and not on the floor... so had i really been on the floor to begin with?

The second paralysis event occurred around 330. I was finally drifting when the ringing and thundering began followed by the cold chills. This time, I heard a man speaking to me, and he reached for me, and I started to panic, help me help me.. the room always grows much bigger than what it is, ceilings very tall and spacious surrounding. I shook myself out of that one

The third paralysis event however was mind blowing. It occurred immediately after the second when I came back to my senses. I was so terrified to go back to sleep that I ""stood up to go make me a cup of coffee"". I began walking to the kitchen, everything fine and dandy, knowing I was giving up the night. As I reached to flip the switch, I noticed the room was glowing orange, as if a candle was lit. I didnt think much of it as I reached to turn on the kitchen light. As I did so, I saw sparks of color emit from to switch, but no light! Wtf i said, as suddenly my body felt extremely numb, tingling and I realized omg this is another paralysis state. I knew it was a ""dream?"" So i jumped and for 2 seconds I floated, before snapping back to my body on the couch where once more i was staring at the ceiling. 

These incidents feels so real that I question whether they are real... for hours afterwards I can't tell if im awake or dreaming, as im so confused I cannot differentiate between the two. 

Worst ever last night and most frequent of my life. Heres what I've learned to help others.

How for me it happens-Sleep Deprivation/dimly lit room. Living rooms are even more susceptible because they are thourofairs of energy/traffic. Things travel thruout the house, but rooms are more still and steady in an energy sense, meaning less chance of paralysis. So, If you toss and turn a lot and cannot fall asleep, but keep trying into the wee hours of the morning, you are likely to hit sleep paralysis state. 

Warning signs of impending paralysis-very loud ringing of ears, thundering sound that one could relate to ear drums shaking or moving best way to describe. Feeling of cold, tingling all over the body, numbness. Strange sounds, such as the dishes I mentioned earlier. No one is gonna ne washing dishes at 300am in darkness lol... 

Breakouts-according to this forum which claims no religious or mystical definitions allowed (pretty dumb tbh considering fringe topic but what TF ever yall) i call a name (dont want to offend the MODs...) and it works usually within 5-10 seconds. In fact, I feel the energy subside after calling, as if the energy were walking away from me and I feel it less and less. Very powerful name, I find darkness runs from Him. Regardless, you will still run into these states if you try going to sleep again. Get up and do something such as take a shower, drink a glass of milk.. something different then go back to bed and you'll ne okay. If you try to go back to sleep immediately after, it will just continue repeatings itself

How to tell if your in the dream or not. Jump. If you float or fly, your dreaming. If not you are indeed awake. Also look in a mirror. This has been so crazy last night was craziest ever ",1,1762177814.0,Sleepparalysis,0,1.0,False

1onc78h,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1onc78h/suggestions_for_everything/,Suggestions for EVERYTHING,"Hey guys, I'm moving rapidly in the direction of the insufferable coffee snob at the table, and I think it's only going downhill from here so I'm open to every suggestion for someone who is elitist in the coffee tasting department but also occasionally has flies flying out of my wallet. 
Currently, I'm on a Bialetti 3-cup aluminium moka pot(I used the cheapest, most off-brand silly one to prove to my parents this isn't one of my temporary fixations for months, I have just upgraded to the fancy one) and I just get pre-ground small packs of 75g coffee from Blue Tokai in the moka grind so I can get the closest to ""freshly"" ground coffee before running out. 
[I need the extraction to be pressurized, as close to a watered-down espresso shot as possible without the machinery, so the equipment unfortunately is not open for negotiation. Also, I just spent money on the new moka pot so I will be exiled for another equipment purchase.]

The other day I went down a deep rabbit hole about local coffee plantations giving away their batches of fresh beans to roast, and now I want to just get roasted beans and a grinder. I've went through this thread so I know the usual recs: Timecore 2CS and (3CS but I don't have that kind of money), and QAir, so here's my open discussion for fellow moka addicts: 

1. Should I add to my parents' financial liabilities by investing in a grinder or is pre-ground okay for now? 
1.5. If pre-ground is okay, what is your must-try? Brand and estate? 
2. If I do make the leap, what is your go-to bean recommendation? 
3. Is there any local seller selling batches of beans that you swear by? I'm trying to support smaller coffee farms as best as I can, so that would be good to try.

[Side-note: I'm a transitioning vegan, so mixing milk/cream is simply not a factor to consider.]
Flavour profiles I enjoy for reference: low acidity, bitterness medium, fruity is nice but I adore the caramel/butterscotch notes the most, I do however have a very soft spot for dark chocolate-orange blends. Usually prefer a heavier body over lighter. I like to have all three roasts on hand because I need the kick of a light roast somedays but taste wise I love a medium-dark roast. 

Throw every suggestion you have about anything at me, I'm open to trying as much as I can without organ selling requiring budgets. Thanks!

dato che lurko qui da parecchio tempo, approfitto della mia pausa pranzo per condividere con voi un progetto a cui mi ero dedicato 2 anni fa e avevo già postato su r/espresso.

Si tratta di un macinacaffè Gaggia MDF (modello originale, quello prodotto dal 1979 ai primi anni 2000) modificato per permettere una regolazione ""stepless"" (non usare i click predefiniti del macinacaffè, ma fare modifiche più precise) e per essere usato in ""singola dose"", cioè evitare di usare la campana per conservare i chicchi, ma inserire ogni volta la quantità che si desidera macinare. Questa modifica mi ha permesso di sperimentare diversi pacchi di caffè diversi, dosando ogni volta la quantità giusta. È un progetto abbastanza diffuso nella community dell'espresso, se cercate ""gaggia mdf single dose"" troverete diversi progetti simili.

Ho realizzato questo progetto insieme a mio papà, che è sempre stato fissato con l'espresso (ovviamente non in accezione specialty) e le macchinette casalinghe, in particolare le Gaggia, e negli anni ne ha accumulate parecchie, insieme ai loro macinacaffè abbinati. Il macinacaffè sacrificale l'ho acquistato su eBay per una ventina di euro a inizio 2023, anche se alla fine abbiamo usato un altro telaio bianco più rovinato che era già in suo possesso.

Inizialmente l'avevo progettato per utilizzarlo sporadicamente a lavoro per quando avevo bisogno di un colpetto extra di caffeina al pomeriggio (dato che principalmente mi faccio un solo V60 con l'Hario Switch durante la mia pausa mattutina) o per far provare qualche caffè particolare a qualche collega curioso. Considerate che la macchinetta aziendale è una Saeco automatica che non viene pulita praticamente mai e dove il caffè al suo interno è un simil-Borbone di colore tendente al nero.

Dal 2024 ho acquistato con la mia compagna una casa decisamente più ampia del bilocale dove vivevamo prima, per cui ho deciso di portarlo a casa e utilizzarlo per prepararmi il caffè la mattina.  
Nella foto qui sopra è affiancato da una Gaggia Classic, classe 2002, restaurata sempre da mio padre. Da questa foto si può anche vedere una modifica ulteriore che gli ho fatto quest'anno: ho aggiunto un soffietto per tentare di ridurre la retention di caffè (che nell'MDF è mostruosa) stampando in 3D un coperchio superiore con un foro da 7 cm. Ho anche sostituito le macine stock con un ricambio compatibile dell'Eureka Mignon.

""Perché non ne hai comprato direttamente uno nuovo?"" (come mi commentò uno su Imgur) Boh, perché non mi andava. Sono molto orientato al making/DIY e volevo vedere se sarei riuscito a replicare questa mod che vedevo circolare da tempo, ho risparmiato qualche soldo, salvato un rifiuto dalla discarica e passato del tempo con mio papà.   
Ad ogni modo, è molto probabile che l'anno prossimo faccia l'investimento in un macinacaffè moderno (soprattutto per retention e facilità di pulizia). Il mio sogno sarebbe il Niche Zero, dato che esteticamente si sposerebbe benissimo con la mia cucina, ma, dato che importarlo dal UK costa decisamente troppo, sto pensando di optare per il DF64.

My relationship with my in-laws has always been complicated. There is a lot of history over more than a decade. At the core, I think it's because they think I'm not good for them and that their kid (and sibling) could have done better. Over the years, they’ve developed a pattern of subtle, backhanded behaviors—usually not outright hostility, but covert, psychological slights that accumulate over time and just wear on me. My spouse is aware of this dynamic. Given all this, I typically try to limit our interactions: we live over 7 hours away, and I’d say things are civil, mostly for the sake of the kids and their cousins.

I have a severe allergy that is serious enough that smelling certain dishes can trigger a reaction. I’ve had it all my life, and had one life-threatening incident in the past, so I'm very familiar with it coming on. Everyone *should* be aware of it, atleast my MIL is definitely aware.  We had a recent get-together at the ILs, with their extended family—three generations, and relatives we haven't seen in a long time. As soon as we walked in, I could smell it cooking. To avoid escalating into a full reaction, I grabbed a quick bite, I said a few quick hellos, and then stepped outside and took my allergy medication in the car. I do travel with it, and I was fortunate I have it on hand. My spouse and kids remained inside, while I spent the next three hours outdoors. At some point during that time, everyone stepped out for the family photoshoot (its fall here). Since I was still on the driveway, I was part of the photos, and they all went back in. Some of them asked, and I explained again about the allergy. I got some coffee nearby and caught up on work, and waited until my family was ready to leave. I drove up when it was time to go, kept things polite at the goodbyes, and we left together. 

No one brought up the situation or even acknowledged how awkward it was, and no one apologized. Its really getting to me and I don;t know if my feelings are justified. They absolutely knew I was outside the entire time. Was I actively excluded? Was this a social set-up? Was this a genuine mistake, or am I just overthinking everything?

1onbwsr,https://exapass.org/,I accidentally built a course for procrastinators who only study the night before.,"Last semester was a circus.

I was working full time, skipping lectures because “I’ll watch them later,” and - surprise - never watching them later. Then exam week hit, and I had *five* exams lined up, one per day.

No notes. No summaries. No time. Just a very strong coffee and mild panic.

The first night, I did what any responsible adult would do: stared at my notes for 20 minutes, freaked out, and started searching “how to pass an exam with no studying.”  
Spoiler: no one on the internet had a real answer.

So I built my own.

I started reverse-engineering everything - figuring out which topics professors love, which ones never show up, how to use AI to summarize and explain things I didn’t understand. I used Perplexity to generate ultra-specific mini-quizzes and literally just taught myself what I needed to survive the next day.  
By the fifth, I was somehow… calm?

I passed all five exams. With good grades.  
Meanwhile, some people who’d been studying for a week were still panicking.

That week completely changed how I see studying.  
I realized most of us don’t fail because we’re lazy - we fail because the system assumes we have unlimited time and focus.

Afterwards, I cleaned up my chaotic notes and built a proper version of my “one-day prep” system. That eventually turned into something called Exapass - an AI-assisted method that helps you prep in 24 hours (it even includes a Perplexity Pro sub so you don’t have to keep switching tabs at 3 a.m.). 

But honestly, it all started because I was just trying not to fail.

Yes - this is a promo, but I really believe it can help anyone cramming right now.  
I even dropped the price to $10, mostly so it’s affordable for other broke students (and so I can still afford to live outside my parents' house:D).

If you're not interested in the guide, please provide feedback on the website and what could be improved.

1onbvx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1onbvx0/i_feel_an_urge_to_impulsively_block_online/,I feel an urge to impulsively block online friends out of the blue. Is this justified?,"This particularly happens when I get blocked by someone else (usually an online acquaintance/friend), but can also happen without that - if I'm really in a mental funk at that point. When this happens after getting blocked by someone, I block back not only that person but also am tempted to block more unrelated people as a form of ""getting even"". Blocking back the blocker only isn't cathartic enough, because they still blocked first. 

I already have a consistent tendency to channel/spread my anger/misery outwards by letting everyone know that I'm feeling bad, and sometimes radiate negativity to others. But sometimes I go a step further by actually taking action. I usually randomly/indiscriminately pick people (usually among online friends/acquaintances) who were completely unrelated to the original situation to suddenly block when I decide to do this. The way I view it, they're just the unfortunate targets of my pent up vitriol/rage that I need to release for catharsis. Nothing personal at all against them, as I make these choices randomly. I've done this before with one long-time (4-5 years) online friend just because I happened to be emotionally crashing out about something completely unrelated that day and wanted to outwardly manifest my misery. Fortunately, I unblocked and apologized several months later and we're good friends again.  

I'm also prone to impulsively blocking people if I feel ignored/ghosted by them. In fact, at the very moment of typing this, I am very tempted to, but haven't gone through with, blocking this online friend who tends to go through long periods of not responding to me (i mean 3 weeks or more). The first such period of inactivity from them, I was just about to block them when they happened to return and talk to me some more. (insert that one meme template about a cave miner missing diamonds by giving up just a tad too early) 

Using an analogy, I'd connect my friendships with a coffee mug filled with coffee to the very rim just before the point where liquid will spill out - i.e. only meta-stable. At any point a slight disturbance occurs, such as the table the mug sits on being nudged just a bit, coffee will spill out. ",2,1762176855.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1onbtgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1onbtgm/beware_the_pbear/,Beware the P-Bear,"There’s a point in every camping trip where you realize you’ve gone farther than you should have. For us, it came somewhere along a washed out fire road in the Colville National Forest when my truck bottomed out on a rut and everyone inside went dead quiet.

Then my friend Sam clapped the dashboard and said, “That’s why we brought the truck, right?”  
He was grinning. I was not, driving white knuckled the whole way.

I told him, “Good thing we packed a spare.” That got a laugh from one of the Joshes in the back seat.

There were four of us. Me, Sam, Josh, and Joshua who together we called J&J to save time. We’d been doing this since high school. This is our annual camping trip where we act like idiots in the woods and pretend we hadn’t grown up. Now we were adults with bills and hangovers, but for five days a year we came back to drink, smoke, and roast marshmallows under the stars.

This time Sam had a new spot picked out and he said it was deeper than we’d ever gone before. A statement J&J made sure to repeat over and over again as a crass joke. 

Sam said where we were going used to be part of an old fire-prone zone that was closed years ago. Parks department cuts meant no one patrolled it anymore, which was Sam-speak for: we can drink and not pay for a campsite. So we pushed on.

By the afternoon we reached a small clearing surrounded by thick pine and fern. No road noise. No distant campers. Just us and the wind. We set up a single big tent, got the fire going, and unloaded the cooler. The air smelled like resin and dirt and had that forest smell that tricks you into thinking nothing bad could ever happen out here because nothing is out here. We were alone or so we hoped.

Dinner was hot dogs on sticks and half-burned burgers. The kind of food that tastes better in the woods. J&J passed a joint around while Sam explained how he’d found the place on some old map forum.

“Rangers don’t even bother coming this far anymore,” he said proudly, like that was a good thing. When the sun started dropping, the forest changed. The air got colder, quieter.  
That’s when Sam said, “We should hike before it gets dark. Stretch our legs.”

We hiked maybe an hour, no phones, no service, just flashlights and a worn trail that narrowed the deeper we went. Josh started shouting to hear the echo, “YEEEEAAAHHHH!” His cry bounced back, distant and hollow.

Joshua joined in. “WOOOOO BABY!”

Sam belted out a solid imitation of Mario’s ‘Yahoo.’ Joshua yelled out something from an anime and Josh joined him. Even I yelled out once, just to hear my voice ricochet through the trees.

Then…something screamed back.

It was not an echo. Not even close. It was a deep, angry roar and it came from deeper in the forest and was long enough that by the time it ended, none of us were breathing.

Sam froze on the trail. “What the hell was that?” he asked nonchalantly.

“Cougar?” Josh said, voice cracking.

“That sounded like a person.” I said what the others didn’t want to say.

Sam nodded, but he didn’t look convinced. “All the way out here? Really?”

“Whoever it is, he probably just thinks we’re dumb kids and is trying to scare us.” Joshua said.

With that statement made, I belted out a roar of my own. It was admittedly weak, but out here, it was more than loud enough to travel back the stranger’s way. J&J and Sam joined, giving much better roars of their own. We didn’t get anything back and decided it was time to return to camp, it was getting dark after all.

The campsite felt like home to return to. No one mentioned the scream for the rest of the night and no one wanted to. J&J put on music from a tiny Bluetooth speaker and Sam threw some brats on our makeshift campfire grill and we forgot about the whole thing.

We turned in early that night, all four of us crammed into the tent like sardines. It was warm, loud with breathing and shuffling, but at least it felt safe. That was until I woke up in the middle of the night. The forest was absolutely still. There was no wind, no bugs, no sounds at all. I rolled onto my side and looked toward the mesh screen near my head.

Out past the tree line, maybe twenty yards away, something was standing. A shape. Tall. Wide. Motionless. For a second I thought it was just a tree I hadn’t noticed before, but as my eyes adjusted, it looked off… like it was breathing.  
I blinked, and it was gone. I lay there, listening to my own heartbeat. Told myself I was overtired. That it was the dark playing tricks. Eventually, somehow, I was able to fall back asleep.

I didn’t say anything about the figure I saw in the woods that night. I should have, but I didn’t. Maybe I was afraid of getting laughed at. Maybe part of me already knew it wasn’t something that could be explained. Or maybe I just didn’t want to admit that something was wrong.  
The next morning, everything felt normal again. The sun was bright, the air had that crisp pine scent, and someone had left the fire pit still smoldering. We made coffee and oatmeal. Sam passed around beef jerky like it was communion and J&J argued about sports cars. I almost let myself believe that nothing had happened.

We set out for a long hike after breakfast. Sam had marked out a loop on an old topographic map and said it would take us past an abandoned lookout tower about four miles out, then circle back toward camp.  
It was a good hike. It was just hard enough to wake us up, but not so tough that we couldn't smoke weed the whole way. 

Josh kept narrating like we were on a nature show and Joshua pointed out every pile of scat like they were landmines. Sam led us, as always, cutting through undergrowth like he’d done it a thousand times. Every now and then, he’d stop, look at the trees, then check the map like he was keeping something to himself. We never did find that lookout tower.

About three hours in, the trail narrowed, and the forest started to feel... tight. The kind of tight where you realize you haven’t had an inch to yourself you weren’t sharing with an especially prickly tree. The trees out here were so tall and thick, they blocked out half the sky. That’s when we wisely chose to turn around. No one said it out loud, but we all felt it. We had gone too deep.

We got back to camp and ate grilled corn on the cob and chicken burgers. The smell was absolutely divine and I had said something about attracting bears. That's when one of Joshes, I can’t remember which one, mentioned him for the first time on this trip.

“The only bear I’m worried we’ll attract out here is the P-Bear.” There it was, the first mention of the P-Bear. We couldn’t go one fucking camping trip without this stupid running joke we’ve had going since high school from coming up.

The P-Bear is a bear that is attracted to the smell of pee and loves to drink it and will maul you if you waste it by peeing onto the dirt. We made him up as a way to tease each other when we had to go out to piss at night and we all decided unanimously that the P-Bear sounded like Barney the Dinosaur and always did the Barney voice when we’d ‘quote’ The P-Bear.

“Beware the P-Bear.” One of them would always say in that sing-song cartoonish cadence whenever I had to pee at night. I won’t lie. It did bug me. Not because of the P-Bear, but, you know, actual bears that could be out there.

I got them to shut up about the P-Bear while we were eating  and settled into my high as we sat around the fire and drank beers. Someone threw on music from Joshua’s phone, which was only what he’d downloaded, so it was a mix of anime songs, classic rock, and SpongeBob sea shanties, and we watched the fire burn down to embers as we drank and smoked the night away. It was thankfully before we all got too crossed when Sam pulled out his travel-size dice bag and notebook.

“D&D?” He asked.

“D&D.” We all roared back in approval.

This was our ritual. Our one and only thing that made these trips feel like the old days again. Even now, fully grown, there was something about the rattle of the dice and Sam’s DM voice that made us act like high schoolers again.

He always started with the same line: “You are standing in a torchlit dungeon. It smells like goblin piss and troll shit…” Sam liked his grimey grimdark settings and this session was no different.

I was playing a barbarian, Joshua was a rogue, and Josh was a druid named Moss Daddy, which he insisted we call him every time we spoke to him in game. The session ran longer than usual. We were stuck in a crumbling ruin, trying to escape a collapsing ceiling when Josh’s character, for no reason other than chaos, tried to pull a lever he wasn’t supposed to.

That’s when Sam, not knowing what to do as a result of the party's chaotic energy, decided to lean into the chaos. “Fuck it, you’ve summoned the P-Bear.” 

I groaned as the avalanche of P-Bear quotes began.

“Heeeyyy booooy… why do you pee so close to the fire when you could be peeing in my mouth?”

“That pee better be for me!”

“Gotta go potty? Not without feeding the P-Bear!”

I even got in on it with a half hearted, “Beware the P-Bear.” Before we got TPK’d by the piss loving beast.

We packed up the game, crawled into the tent, and called it a night after that. I remember lying in my sleeping bag, hearing the others breathing around me, those deep, quiet exhales that meant they were already out cold. I wasn’t. I was always the last one to fall asleep.

I stared at the top of the tent for a while, watching the moonlight shift and flicker through the nylon as the trees swayed overhead. At some point, I thought I saw something again. A shape. A figure. Just beyond the treeline. But when I blinked, it was gone and I told myself it was just the weed and beer. My mind would eventually settle and sleep would overtake me.

I woke up groggy, mouth dry, and slightly chilled. It was the kind of morning where the tent feels colder than the outside air. J&J were already rustling around, groaning about their hangovers and complaining about the uneven ground they slept on.

We grilled up the last of the sausages for breakfast as Sam handed out water bottles like peace offerings after last night’s TPK. Spirits were weirdly high this morning. I think it was the clear weather, bright sun slicing through the fog, and the sound of birds singing in the air. We figured a short morning hike would shake our hangovers off and get us recharged. Sam led the way, a Lewis and Clark looking ass map in hand, pointing us toward an old trail that wound up into higher elevations. He said if we got to higher ground, we could find that fire watchtower that had eluded us.

About twenty minutes in, I lagged behind to piss. I said nothing to the others to avoid the barrage of P-Bear jokes. They were too swept up in their conversation anyway to notice me ducking off trail behind some thick pines. I started to relieve myself into the dirt and listened to my friends chatter fade away as they got farther and farther away. And that’s when I heard it.

“For me?” I heard a man say in a silly sounding voice right behind me.

I didn’t bother zipping up as I spun around. If it was one of my friends trying to fuck with me, then they were getting an eye full of my dick as punishment.

But there was nothing behind me. Just wind pushing through the trees. I zipped up and ran as fast as I could toward my friends.

When I caught back up to the group, I didn’t even try to play it cool. “Okay, you guys ain’t screwing around, right? I heard someone behind me speak like P-Bear while I was pissing.”

Immediately I was hit with P-Bear joke after P-Bear joke.

“Oh, did you make sure to feed him so we’ll be safe tonight, Paul.”

“Rule 1, Paul, is to never pee alone when the P-Bear is about. You should have brought a pee buddy.”

“But then you’d just die too.”

“Guys, I’m serious right now.”

“Are you Paul, are you super cereal right now?” They all started doing Al Gore impressions from South Park.

“Are you saying P-Bear is real? Are you cereal, Paul?”

“I’m serious. The laugh. It was right next to me. I was peeing and…”

They were already moving on, dismissing me, but I was still shaken. Someone was out here with us and I was the only one who believed it. I didn’t let them get ahead of me again. I clung to the group and watched our backs like ambush could come at any moment. I was jumpy and that made the others laugh.

“You really aren’t joking, huh?” Sam asked.

“We all heard that yell,” I said. “We’re not alone out here.”

“You think we’re being followed?”

“Out here, how could we know for certain?”

As if to answer my question, the trail ahead of us turned as we entered a stretch of forest that had clearly burned rather recently. The trees were blackened skeletons, stripped of life, creaking when the wind touched them. Charred trunks like rotten teeth jutted out in every direction, and the underbrush was brittle and quiet. The sun turned weird here, filtered through gray ash and skeletal branches. It gave everything that hollow vibe you get from looking at WW1 battlefield photos.

“Dude,” Josh whispered. “This place looks like a Fallout game.”

We all cracked up but there was something undeniably eerie about being here. So much so, no one argued when I suggested we head back. Something about that dead forest just rubbed us wrong. It felt like if we kept going, we’d just… get lost in it. Forever.

Things would only get worse from there. When we got back to camp, Sam found something on a tree closest to our tent. It was a carving. Fresh. Still bleeding sap. Letters gouged into the bark like someone had taken a hunting knife and had just gone to town.

“BEWARE THE P-BEAR!” Joshua read aloud.

We all just stared at it for a minute confused. It hadn’t been there that morning. Not when we made breakfast. Certainly not the night before. And it wasn’t just scratched on. This thing was carved deep into the wood. It would’ve taken real time and force.

No one moved. J&J looked at each other, then at me. “Okay, Paul,” Josh said. “Nice touch. Creepy font. Love it.”

“I didn’t do that,” I said, voice shaking.

Joshua laughed. “Come on, you woke up early or something and did it.”

“I didn’t. Do. That.”

Sam brought his hand across the carved letters and took a step back. “We were all together,” Sam said quietly. “On the hike. No one stayed back and this is fresh.”

“Someone could be following us,” I blurted out.

Josh rolled his eyes. “To play into a joke only we make? Nice try, Paul.” He looked at Sam and shook his head. “You in on this too?” He mockingly asked as he went to start a fire to cook because what the fuck else was there to do now.

I turned to Sam and whispered, “We need to leave here tonight.” I jingled my keys for emphasis.

Sam seemed to consider my plan to get the fuck out for a moment, but then the smell of grilled onions ended any debate we were about to have. “You sure you don’t wanna go home early like you always do?”

“Excuse me?” I said, doing my best to keep my voice diplomatic.

“Woah man, I’m not trying to be mean here, but we pranked you plenty in the past by making up cryptids and scaring the shit out of you with them. You remember the Ferry Lake Freak? You wouldn’t get near the water, let alone in it, after we told you about him and we made him up that night just to fuck with you.” Sam pointed at the carving. “This feels like you trying to get back at us for that.”

“Sam, I’m not making this up.” I pleaded with him to believe me, but he gave me a shrug as if that somehow sufficed as a response and walked away.

I considered taking my truck and leaving them all right then and there. The P-Bear could kill and eat them for all I cared. But a voice in my head, one I often confused for my rationality, convinced me that I had yet to witness something definitively menacing and that I should just have a beer and chill the fuck out.

That night, we built the fire high. The air was colder and windier and the trees swayed like they were whispering secrets to each other. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone out there anymore, but I did my best to drown that feeling with booze and weed. If I was gonna get randomly murdered, I might as well be so fucked up I won’t even realize it.

Dinner was quieter. J&J still cracked jokes, but not as loud. Not as often. Sam barely ate. He kept staring at the tree with the carving, like it might change if he watched it long enough. We didn’t play D&D that night. No one had the energy. We just sat around the fire and drank.

Finally, toward the end of the night, I had to break the seal and stood up. The second I stepped past the light of the fire, I hesitated. “Need a flashlight?” Sam asked, noticing my hesitation.

I nodded. He tossed me one and I walked about twenty feet into the brush, just past the log we’d set up as a bench. Unzipped. And then…I heard it.

Another. Fucking. Chuckle.

This one was low, raspy and then weirdly high-pitched at the end.

“Huh-huh-huhhhh…”

I froze mid-stream. Shined the light toward the sound and prayed it was one of the Joshes playing a prank, but there was nothing. Just trees.

Then, behind me, maybe ten feet away, I heard it again. Closer this time.

“Huh-huh-huhhhh…”

My mouth went dry. The flashlight flickered once. I zipped up fast and walked back toward camp without saying a word.

“Everything alright?” Joshua asked when I sat back down.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t want to believe what I just heard. I was too drunk is what I told myself. They were just fucking with me. Everyone was just fucking with me. I told myself those lies over and over again in my head as the others said nothing.

That night, we locked the bear bag, doused the fire, and zipped the tent tight. The four of us crammed in shoulder to shoulder. No one was laughing anymore. Sam laid with his back to the tent wall, facing me. He whispered, “We leave tomorrow.”

“But we’ve got three days left,” I whispered back.

“I don’t like this place,” he said. “I’ve camped in this forest a dozen times. But I’ve never been this deep. Things don't feel right out here.”

I didn’t argue. I laid awake most of that night, flashlight gripped in one hand.

At some point, I must’ve drifted off. But before I did, I heard something from the trees again. It wasn’t laughter this time. It was humming. Just a few bars. Slow. Childlike. Then silence.

We should’ve left that morning. Sam said we would. He was serious, too. I saw it in his face when he unzipped the tent at dawn and looked out like he was expecting something to be waiting there. But when we stepped outside, everything looked… normal. The carving was still there. Still raw. But the fire pit was undisturbed, the bear bag untouched. No sign of animals, or people, or anything at all. Just quiet.

We spent the morning packing slowly. We were dragging our feet more than we’d admit. Sam double-checked our route, but none of us were in a rush. I think we were waiting to feel safe again. To laugh about it. To let the weirdness fade into something explainable. That’s what we always do when the woods get spooky.

By noon, it felt like maybe we’d just psyched ourselves out. Sam agreed to stay one more night. We’d leave at sunrise, hike out early before the sun got too high. That was the plan. The rest of the day after that was mostly uneventful. We hiked a short loop, filtered water from a nearby stream, and sat around the fire killing the last of the whiskey. J&J were back to joking again, not as loud, not as wild, but trying to bring joy back into the air.

Around dusk, I wandered out to take a piss again. Even though the last time had been… bad, I told myself it was probably an animal. Or my imagination. Or both. I stepped behind the same log and unzipped. The forest was golden in that late summer glow. The light leaked sideways through branches like stained glass. It almost put me at ease. And then, somewhere far to the left, I heard a sound.

“Hey Paul…” It was my name. Said softly. Too softly.

I turned. “Sam?”

No answer.

Then again, from the right this time, “Paaaul…” Drawn out. Like a kid trying to be spooky.

I zipped up. “Who’s there?”

No response… I turned back toward camp and stopped when I heard it from behind me, this time louder, much louder, “Paul….Heeey… Paul. Don’t you dare walk away without feeding the P-Bear.” There was no attempt at a cadence to the voice at the end. It was a grown man speaking in a deep bass that I know none of the others voices could produce.

I ran back to camp as fast as I could and told the others what just happened. This time, they didn’t laugh. Even J&J went quiet.

“You sure it wasn’t one of us? Please tell me it was one of you guys?” Joshua asked, but he didn’t sound confident as he looked at the faces of the others.

Sam shook his head. “This place echoes weirdly. Could’ve been anything.”

But I saw the way he kept glancing at the trees. He was starting to believe me. They were all starting to believe me.

We stood there for a while in silence. All four of us were staring at that carved warning like we were waiting for the punchline to come bouncing out of the dark to chase us.

Then Sam suddenly cupped his hands around his mouth and bellowed into the trees and yelled, “Fuck off, P-Bear! You’re freaking out our driver!” His voice bounced through the woods and disappeared. “Are you happy now, Paul?” He said as he turned to me.

J&J cracked up. “Dude,” Josh wheezed through a puff of his dab pen. “What if the trees are the ones talking?""

“We are starting fires and smoking hella weed, so maybe they trying to get us to fuck off.” J&J began to laugh and once they were both laughing, there was no getting through.

I got to my feet and yelled “I know what I heard!” That shut them up.

Sam studied me. The smirk faded. I could see the wheels turning. “Look,” he finally said, “if you really think something’s out here, you can leave. You’re not chained to us. The truck's yours, right?”

He knew I wouldn’t abandon them out here. But the worst part was that I think he believed his own bullshit, that he could just hike them out if anything went wrong. Like some D&D ranger leading his clueless party through the woods. He’d get them all killed.

Sam clapped me on the back. “Or… we stay one more night. Grill up the last of the food. Tell more stories and we promise to make no more P-Bear jokes.” I looked at each of them to gauge if this was them subtly revealing that they were fucking with me the whole time. J&J were looking at me, grinning like dopes, while Sam seemed partly sincere and partly just trying to get me to stay out here another night.

“Fine,” I said. “One more night.” This would be my greatest regret and if I’m being honest, at that point, I think it was already too late.

That night, none of us could sleep, least of all me. The forest around our tent felt like it was waiting for something. We laid in silence for a long time, all of us awake. You could tell by the stillness in the air that would otherwise be filled with the sound of J&J snoring.

Then something started making sounds. At first, they were small ones, like twigs snapping under their feet as they circled the tent.

Then a new sound…A crying baby.

It was not a recording. It was real and it was trying to sound like a baby. It came from deep in the woods. Then from the other side of camp. Then close. Too close.

Josh whispered, “No fucking way…”

Then, from outside the tent, clear as day, “Heyyy guys…” It was the voice from before. It sounded like someone doing a bad impression of us. Like, they had heard us all talk and were now trying to mock us. “Heeey… guys… you in there? It’s me the P-bear huh-huh-huhhhh…Lemme in…” at the end he dropped the Barney voice and went deep just like he did before.

Sam sat up. “We need to go now.”

“We can’t go in the dark,” I said. “That’s exactly what it wants.”

Sam didn’t argue. No one said anything else. But we felt his presence outside, just beyond the nylon. Waiting for us to make a run for it.

When we took too long it began to drag something across the tent wall. A stick maybe. Or claws.

The sound sliced from one side to the other. It was slow and deliberate. J&J huddled together. I gripped the flashlight in my hand, white-knuckled and ready to fight for my life. Then silence. Nothing but silence for hours.

We sat like that until dawn. When the light finally started creeping through the mesh, I dared to peek out. The forest looked the same. But the air felt wrong. Something smelled awful.

I unzipped the flap and that’s when I saw it. On the outside of the tent, just above where I had been lying, was a streak of piss. A thick, yellow line. Still wet. Someone had pissed on our tent.

Sam was the first one out. He didn’t say anything, just stared at the mark for a long beat, then went straight to work packing his gear. No jokes. No theories. Just motioned for us to follow suit. No breakfast. No fire. No words, really. We were all running on fumes from the night before, and the piss stain said more than any of us could.

But things got worse. We reached the truck and that’s when I noticed it. One tire was flat. Then two. Then all four. Slashed. Not clean slashes either. They were jagged tears, as if someone had gone at them with a hunting knife or a rock.

Josh knelt to check the damage and recoiled. “Oh fuck!”

The underside of the truck reeked like gasoline and something bitter. That’s when we noticed the puddle. Hidden just behind the front wheel well, a slow seep of fuel was spreading out in the pine needles and dirt.

Sam popped the hood. “No way,” he muttered. The fuel line had been cut clean through along with the brake lines.

I realized, then, why I hadn’t smelled gas earlier. The piss. It had been sprayed on the tent, all around the base. Enough to sting the air, to mask the chemical scent that should’ve tipped us off.

I usually always locked the truck. Always. Except…Except when I went camping. Who the hell would break into a locked car all the way out here? I had gotten my answer. The spares? Gone. The car jack and tire iron? Also missing.

Sam kicked the bumper hard enough to limp. Josh was pacing. Joshua sat down on a rock and just kept repeating, “No way. No way. No way.”

That’s when Sam made the call. “We hike out.” He pulled the old topo map from his backpack, the one he’d been so smug about when we planned this trip. Said it had trails on it no one knew about anymore. Said we could follow an old fire road west and loop back to a main trailhead that connected to Highway 20. Said it was easy. “We’ll be out by lunch,” he told us.

We left just after 8 a.m. But by noon… we were back at camp.

Sam’s trail, the one he swore existed, was a dead end. The path marked on the map had vanished, buried under decades of deadfall and washed out slopes. What might’ve once been a road was now a mess of tangled roots, blackened stumps, and twisted trees. Maybe the fire that closed this area years ago had altered the terrain. Maybe Sam’s map was out of date. Or maybe something didn’t want us leaving that way.

We looped for hours. Drained our water. Reached the same creek twice. The second time, Josh didn’t even pretend to laugh about it. Sam tore up the map in frustration. That’s when it hit me: we weren’t just lost. We were being herded. Back to the campsite. Back to our abandoned, piss-stained tent… Back to the bleeding tree that said, BEWARE THE P-BEAR.

“No one else is out here,” Sam whispered again and again to himself.

J&J were standing shoulder to shoulder, silent for once. Joshua was shaking. Josh kept muttering, “Who the fuck does this… who the fuck…”

We stood around the truck for a long time, like it might apologize. Like we could will the tires back to life. Then we heard it again.

From the woods. First the cry of a dying deer. Then the voice of someone calling out:

“Saaaam…Paul? Help…” The tone was off. Flat. Like someone reciting the idea of words. Then it was right back to P-Bear. “You tinkle I’ll lick your sprinkles…” followed by more laughter.

Sam kept the hatchet by his side. I clutched the flashlight like a weapon. J&J had rocks in their hands. We then heard something knock gently on the tree with the carving.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

And then…“Bewaaare… the Peeeee-Bearrrrrr…” It was drawn out like a song. Echoing. Mocking us as he laughed.

I did what I dared not to till now and shined the flashlight at the source of the laughter. When I did all I could make was a large shape cowering behind a tree, but one thing was clear, it looked like a bear.

I don’t remember who screamed first, but the moment they did, the rest of us were already moving. We left everything that might slow us down and it’s a good thing we did, because it began to chase after us.

“What do you want?!” I shouted into the blackness as we fled, heart in my throat, flashlight trembling in my hand. I meant it as a challenge. A scream into the void.

But then he answered, “You know what I want!”

We didn’t stop. We just kept running until we heard his heavy footfalls fade in the distance behind us. And even then, it wasn’t until Josh nearly collapsed from exhaustion, did we finally slow down.

Sam led us from there. He had the best sense of direction, even in the dark. The moon did give us just enough light to see the trail, but it wasn’t much of one. We had made decent time for a while as the adrenaline carried us, that was until we hit the ridge.

The path thinned and tilted dangerously, the dirt sloping toward a long drop into thick brush and rotted trunks. On the other side was the tree line, just rows of bark and shadow like silent sentries watching from the dark. Sam raised his hand to stop us. That’s when we saw him.

At first I thought it was a tree. Then it moved. It was a large figure, tall and bulky, stooped low just beyond the edge of our flashlights. Its face along with much of its body was wrapped in something. It didn’t speak. It didn’t run at us. It just watched us.

Then, it took a single step closer. Slow. Deliberate.

“Back up,” Sam whispered.

“No,” I said, louder than I meant to. “No, we’re not going back. It’s what he wants.”

“Then what?” he snapped. “We can’t go forward!”

“I’ll go and you guys run,” said Joshua, voice shaking.

Josh grabbed him. “No you fucking won’t.”

It took another step forward and was now illuminated by our flashlights. At first, I thought it was a rotted old bear carcass walking on its own, then I realized someone was wearing it and puppeted the dead bear’s arm to give us a wave hello.

It was at that moment, Joshua pissed himself. The breeze shifted and the thing’s head turned toward the smell. Not the bear’s head, the real one. The human head underneath. His face was visible just past the mouth of the rotting bear mask. His eyes were too wide, his skin too pale, and his mouth streaked with dried blood and dirt. He screamed at the top of his lungs, “Ohhh boy…my favorite.”

Josh bolted back down the trail, crashing through brush like an animal.

“Josh!” Sam yelled, but it was too late.

Joshua chased after him as I turned to Sam, “Come on,” I said. “We have to go.”

“No, you go…” Sam held out his hatchet and took a firm stance, “I’ll hold him off.”

I didn’t argue. I wish I could have told you I did. That I said some shit about not leaving without him behind, but no, I didn’t say any of that, I just turned and ran. I don’t remember for how long. I think I blacked out at some point. I remember crashing through ferns, my legs bleeding, my ears ringing from my own heartbeat.

Eventually I stopped, collapsed, and hid behind a dead log. My arms were shaking so hard I could barely breathe. And then I heard him. Not footsteps. Just talking. From maybe twenty feet away. From the trees. Behind me.

“Paul…Heeyyyy, Paul…You want to top me off?” The voice moved in circles around me, like a predator circling his prey.

I squeezed my eyes shut and felt a warm streak of piss run down my leg. I couldn’t help myself. I thought I was gonna die. That’s when I heard him…right next to me… drink up the piss pooling in the dirt by my legs. He just drank it like a dog. He smelled so awful that I wanted to vomit, but I dared not make a sound. I kept my eyes shut and my body as still as my shivering would allow.

“You’re a good boy, Paul.” Is the last thing I heard before everything fell silent.

I don’t remember how they found me. When I came to, I was in the back of a Search and Rescue vehicle.

An older guy gave me a blanket and said, “You’re safe now.”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t believe him at first. They found J&J two ridgelines over. They were disoriented and dehydrated, but alive.

Sam was never found. The only sign of him they could find was a pile of piss-stained scraps of clothing, including one they think was Sam’s shirt hung up on a tree like a trophy.

But they never found a body.

When the cops later asked me what had happened, I told them the truth. I said, “We mocked the dark and something in the dark mocked us back.”

“What does that mean?” One of the cops asked, confused by my bizarre wording.

My answer certainly didn’t help, “Beware The P-Bear.” is all I had to say in response.

Cutting out gluten completely really helped with bloating, huge difference. Gluten is not our friend.
And helped with gas 

I also cut out most processed foods, but they are creeping back in. So got to get back on track with those. 

But the heavy blood flow I don't think has improved. I did have acupuncture at the start and that helped with blood flow about 20%. Was 50 super plus tampons, now it's about 35. 

I just cut out coffee for a month, can't say I noticed a massive distance in the symptoms but I was drinking wine, and probably too much. 

So this month I'm going to do the following
1. Avoid red meat
2. Only eat organic chicken or turkey, if I can't find it I wont eat it
3. Only organic eggs
4. Avoid alcohol and coffee - I am still going to drink black tea
5. Zero dairy 
6. More dark leafy greens, 3 x a day 
7. More flaxseed and walnuts and lentils
8. No gluten
9. No processed foods
10. More fermented foods
11. Quinoa, oats ok. 
12. Ensure my water intake is good
13. Walk daily at least 30 minutes

And I'm buying the following supplements - 
1. DIM with Vit D - helps the liver get rid of excess estrogen
2. Fish oils 
3. Probiotics with a probiotic 
4. Iron chelate supplement with b vitamins 

I'm also substituting tampons for a menstrual disc - it holds 6 super plus tampons with of blood. BPA free, no suction like the moon cup

I'll give everyone an update in just over a month, once my next period has finished.

Yes, many mornings I actually do hunt, but sometimes I just need to decompress dammit! It’s dawn and dusk, so it doesn’t interfere with most of our weekend sports. I’m home mid day. Don’t like heights? You can sit in a tent on the ground. Have no interest in hunting? Just lie and say you didn’t see any deer and chill with an audiobook, blanket, and snacks. 

My husband likes it because he can sleep in and be lazy with the kids or eat a garbage dinner on the couch (no “chores” from me), and he likes the idea of a free years worth of meat. The one grandparent who lives near us has been helping out because he also wants free meat to smoke.

It’s no-questions asked alone time. Spent the hunt listening to ACOTAR audiobook, took a nap, and ate cheeseballs all morning? For all anyone else thinks you’re just a bad hunter and didn’t bag a deer. They’re never going to know…",22,1762176462.0,breakingmom,8,0.87,False

No drinks Saturday and hydrated. But proudest moment of the weekend was putting my foot down and not getting a mimosa/cocktail/Irish coffee at brunch yesterday.

1onbmo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1onbmo4/aitah_for_not_having_strict_rules_when_it_comes/,AITAH for not having strict rules when it comes to my baby and making my SIL feel bad about it?,"Husband and I have a baby boy who is 6 months. My SIL and BIL have a 1,5 years old girl. SIL and I have very different rules when it comes to our children and I guess this is what created this issue. 

SIL is what husband calls a helicopter parent. She has 100 rules when it comes to her daughter and it's honestly too much sometimes. Some examples: no one in the family was allowed to see the kid until she turned 3 months old, each time we see her we get slapped with her set of rules (no kissing, no hugging, no picking up without her approval, no visiting without being invited etc). The rules are valid, however it's her way of imposing them meaning that everytime we meet she gives us a 10 minutes lecture on what we are not allowed to do. Once we were all in the same room and my MIL looked her daughter's way and made the sound of a kiss towards her. It was just the gesture of a kiss from afar, not a real kiss, however SIL spent 15 minutes explaining us why we are not allowed to kiss her. I was not allowed to hold her daughter until recently because of my nails. I normally have medium nails, not extremely long, not pointy, but somehow she acted like I would stab her kid with my nails. Whatever. 

Husband and I are very relaxed when it comes to our parents. Everytime they come by we use the chance to do things that we don't have time to do any other time or just go out for a coffee just the 2 of us. Honestly, even having my MIL watching the baby while husband and I go outside to smoke a cigarette is very relaxing and seems like an adventure for us. My in laws are coming this end of the week to stay with our son because husband and I need to sort some paperwork for a property. When SIL found out about this she got mad and she sent me a text last evening complaining about all the things that I do to spite her. Main things are: 

1. I had to recover fast after my c section just to spite her and show everybody I am better than her. Which of course is not true. She needed 1 month to recover after her surgery, I was able to clean the house, take care of my baby and be functional 5 days after my surgery but it's just my body. I recover well after surgeries. Also I kind of developed a cleaning obsession after I got back from the hospital so it was a mental thing, not that I wanted to prove something. I just couldn't stop for a while. 

2. I don't impose too many rules to my in laws just to show them I am better than her. Not true. I have a set of rules but if they want to hold the baby they are free to do it without asking if they are allowed. If they want to cuddle the baby, they are free to do it. I don't mind, my husband doesn't mind. 

3. Because of me not imposing the same rules as her, I get help while she doesn't. The thing is one of her rules is that we don't go to visit her without being invited and she rarely invites us so how is she supposed to get help if we can't go to her place? 

Anyways, my husband says she is crazy but I keep wondering, is there anything I am doing to make her feel this way? I am not competing with her in any way, I don't want to gain points or anything, it's just the way I choose to raise my child. So AITAH? Am I doing something wrong here?

I (23F) have been seeing a guy (25M) for 3 weeks. He’s genuinely a wonderful person: kind, respectful, thoughtful, treats me really well. But there are a few things that have been weighing on me, and I’d love to hear if people think a relationship like this could realistically work long-term.

He’s very religious, and a part of a community in London. I do believe in God too, deeply, but I’m not comfortable being part of a religious community that I feel can be restrictive or judgmental. I just prefer a more personal faith, without all the institutional rules and guilt.

On a coffee date, he had some behaviors that made me feel hurted, and I’ve been thinking about that. And after we discussed the religious part, he grew distant for a few days, which made me insecure. Later, he apologized sincerely about those situations and I know he really meant it.

He’s said that we could find a “middle ground,” but I still sense that deep down he expects me to participate in his church. I’m scared that in the future (if we had kids) I’d feel like an outsider in my own family for not sharing that same level of involvement.

I don’t know what to do and I feel guilty, he’s a genuinely good man, and I keep wondering if I’ll make a mistake if I choose to move on. 

Am I overthinking this? Could something like this actually work long-term? ",1,1762176190.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

My wife and I are looking for someone to stay in our apartment and help with the running rent while we travel abroad, anytime between **November and January** (flexible dates). About the place:

* 1-bedroom apartment - cozy, welcoming, and spotless clean
* Located right next to a beautiful park with laptop-friendly spots and in a fancier area of Bucharest; plenty of cafes, restaurants, hypermarkets, other parks, anything you can imagine in walking distance.
* Fully equipped kitchen
* specialty coffee shop setup
* 1 GB/s fiber internet, 5GHz reliable WiFi
* dual-monitor setup with a height adjustable desk and ergonomic chair
* Netflix, Youtube Premium, and Plex
* Great mattress and pillows
* Washing machine, air purifier, PlayStation, home cinema soundbar, and others...

It’s a warm, homey space with everything you need to feel comfortable and productive.

The rent per night would, of course, be much lower than any Airbnb, with better comfort and amenities, since we travel often and know what makes a place feel right.

Ideally, we'd be having a call or two to get to know each other and discuss anything that comes to mind.

For us, it's very important to host the right person(s), someone reasonable, decent and caring.  
We're also trying Kindred, but just registered and don't know how much time their onboarding will take.

Romania and Bucharest is an extremely safe place, lesser known but very much underrated. You can come for the festive Christmas markets, cozy cafés, winter lights, cultural events, and the chance to experience Romanian holiday traditions in a vibrant, less-crowded city.",1,1762176156.0,digitalnomad,0,1.0,False

Tired of monotonous visualizing and boring affirmations? Totally understandable... I'd also love to just wave my magic wand a few times, spin around in a circle three times, and poof—all my wishes come true. 🧙‍♂️🪄

But what if I told you there's a new manifestation technique that even actors often use to perform better in their roles? This technique is inspired by the famous actor Heath Ledger, who immersed himself so deeply in his role that he never came out of it again and mentally became the Joker.

Oh, by the way: he went insane, like the Joker. Nevertheless, you can use the technique I'm about to introduce to YOU to slip into the role of your manifestation and manifest your dream life 🌈⭐️

Application: For example, if you want to be rich and have a lot of money, from now on you'll take on the role of a wealthy person. The next time you go shopping and the price tags hit you harder than Mike Tyson in his prime, think about how a rich person would think instead—""I don't have to buy it, but if I WANT to, I could afford it."" Or treat yourself once a month to an expensive coffee in a 5-star restaurant—that will definitely make you feel rich, and that's a good thing, because such confirmations are very important in manifesting.

They trick your critical conscious mind, which makes your subconscious more receptive to these things. Just play your role like you used to play pirate as a kid, and over time you'll notice that you're no longer playing a role but LIVING it. 🩷

'Vehicles have been as central to the James Bond cinematic world as the man himself. Whether car, boat, motorbike, or plane, it is not just a machine but a character in its own right.'

\- Chris Corbould, SFX Supervisor, the James Bond films

Taking a cue from Assouline's own long-held sense of high-end luxury, culture and travel, JAMES BOND CARS is the third bespoke 007 coffee table treat from the stylish publishing house. With the first-hand insight from author Chris Corbould (SKYFALL, FORD VS FERRARI), this new 007 chapter for Assouline marks a new vehicular history of a spy - including fresh insight into Aston Martin, Lotus and BMW and the historical specs of some of cinema's most famous wheels, wings and boats

However, all of Bond's modes of transport are in the forecourt of this publication. The more eccentric and memorable modes of Bond transport are also passengers in this work - including a gondola, a motorbike or five,  a gyro-copter, a jetpack and at least one airship.

As he turns himself to directing and writing (having optioned THE CLOUD GARDEN), Chris Corbould is the perfect voice for JAMES BOND CARS. As a long time Bond production veteran, Corbould has steered many a Bond action sequence, stunt and visual effect. He also knows his cars.

With behind-the-scenes production stills, a deep archival drive and lesser seen proofs, insights and original photographs, JAMES BOND CARS is a shining metallic alloy of a book and a great addition to the 007 car library.

1onb9oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1onb9oq/going_to_interlagos_this_weekend_this_guide_may/,Going to Interlagos this weekend? This guide may help you,"Hi, it's me, a redditor from Brazil who got to see F1 at Interlagos a few years ago and decided to help anyone outside my country who come to see this weekend race. So sit here and come with me to understand how to watch the race without too much complication.

First things first. **What you can have at the racetrack**

Brazilian race organization are not friends with fun. So here's what you can have with you:

* a non professional digital camera (basically a camera that you can't replace the lens);
* 3 foods with the original package (personally I like to have with me a huge pack of Ruffles/Doritos/etc. Or fried bananas (have you ever tried one? Its lovely). It's salty, but stops you of getting hungry if you're on a budget) and fruits must be cut and on a zip lock pack;
* flags up to 2mx1,5m;
* bags up to 25cmx25cmx25cm;
* sunscreen up to 100ml;
* a cap/hat;
* rain cape;
* an acrylic or plastic cup (the event will have free water available).

Usually the food rule is subject to be gone as soon as the line for the gates becomes too huge. Lets say that you arrive after 10am, you can try to bring with you more food than it's allowed. The Interlagos team values a speedy line more than a safe race.

Anyway, eat as much food as you can at your breakfast. This will allow you to avoid the lines at the food places inside the track for a few hours.

Now: **What you can't have at the racetrack**

* cans;
* umbrella;
* helmets;
* guns (this is not COTA/Vegas/Miami);
* professional cameras (the ones where you can take the lens) and drones;
* selfie/flag sticks;
* water bottles.

The full list of what you can and cannot have at the track can the found here. This link will also shows how to enter with kids above 5 and bellow 18: [https://help.eventim.com.br/hc/pt-br/article\_attachments/35123315160983](https://help.eventim.com.br/hc/pt-br/article_attachments/35123315160983)

Next: **What you need to have with you at the racetrack**

It's a typical Brazilian GP. So you probably gonna have all the tropical country experience. Try to have with you:

* a raincoat (buy a basically one before the event, because during the weekend you will have to pay a lot more, if possible away from the track). It gets you warm and dry and a raincape can get your body a little warm too, so it's a win win;
* a powerbank (you don't wanna see your batery runs dry)
* a sunscreen protector (use a personal one so you can pass by the gates without problems);
* sunglasses (you will need one, trust me);
* a cap (you will need one, trust me);
* a shirt for a windy day (some parts of the track can get really cold with the wind).

And now: **How to get there**

São Paulo have something that a lot of brazillians don't have: a huge and usually clean metro system. So get a maps app, find the nearest train station and remember the best way to get to the linha Amarela (Yellow line) so you can jump to the linha Esmeralda (Emerald line) at the Pinheiros station and just leave the train when you arrive at the Autódromo station (Racetrack station, for those who don't understand Portuguese). If you arrive at Osasco station, you got the wrong way. Buy your tickets for the weekend at your first trip to the track so you can avoid the lines on your way back.

You can always get a Uber, a taxi or a bus. But the train it's the most used way and also the most convenient.

Remember to check you way from the metro to the track. It's not hard, but you can get in trouble if you get the wrong street. In case of any doubts, just look around, find someone with F1 merch and follow them. Worked for me everytime I've gone to Interlagos.

Also, at the saturday and sunday, try to arrive as early as possible because the track and the lines will be huge after 10 am. Use the jet-lag at your favor.

That being said, the race organization have made a nice work this year with public transport. You should know, before going to the track:

* for R$ 35 you can get an exclusive train called **Expresso GPSP** (GP SP Express). It get passengers at the Pinheiros and Morumbi Claro train stations and leaves you at the Cidade Dutra station in approximately 25m.

**Use the first day to find the best spot** at your grandstand.

At the sector G, you can see all the reta oposta, but only at the end you can see other parts of the race. So lurk around to have some place to be at the weekend when the race starts.

All the food and beverages will be paid by a cashless card. More info here. I recommend to try to buy and recharge before the event: [http://f1saopaulo.com.br/cashless](http://f1saopaulo.com.br/cashless)

There will music shows during the event, at the fanzone. One saturday. The other, sunday. The full weekend schedule is here [https://f1saopaulo.com.br/en/schedule/](https://f1saopaulo.com.br/en/schedule/)

If you have some time to visit São Paulo and the city, It's aways worth to try some coffee shops, a good pão de queijo (will not be really good because it's a pão de queijo made in São Paulo, but will be good), some Minas Gerais cheese (I like Serro more than Canastra, but you should have both), some brazillian churrasco and, if you like some LGBT+ themed bar, go to the Dentro Bar. Its the best one.

It reminded me that when I stepped into the store, I saw a guy holding his drink and ask the clerk to make another one. It probably wasn’t the first time she had made a mistake.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Ever caught yourself saying, “Tomorrow’s the day,” and then… it never is? That slow drag of procrastination can drain your focus, mood, and even your sense of self-worth. You feel guilty for doing nothing yet too tired to change it. If that sounds familiar, [Challenge Life – Explore – Give – Enjoy](https://tetra-links.com/bookfunnel-ba000-official) might just pull you out of that loop and into something brighter.

It’s short, warm, and refreshingly honest. Written by **Raj Pal Singh Kharabanda**, a man who swapped burnout for balance, this book focuses on **how to transform pain into motivation** in ways that actually make sense.



# 📘 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Challenge Life – Explore – Give – Enjoy  
**Category:** Self-Help & Personal Growth ➜ Motivation & Taking Action  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.6/5

Clocking in at about 150 pages, it’s both compact and surprisingly full of practical ideas. The author’s backstory feels familiar - overworked, exhausted, and searching for purpose. Instead of just talking about positivity, he teaches how to **turn challenges into personal growth** through his signature idea: “painuation” (pain + situation).

Each section encourages movement over mood. It’s not your typical “think happy thoughts” manual - it’s an **action plan for mind, body, and soul** that focuses on doing, not just dreaming.



# ✍️ About the Author

**Raj Pal Singh Kharabanda** once managed a busy hotel in Frankfurt until his body said, “Nope.” After years of exhaustion, he shifted his focus and began writing about action-based growth. That lived experience gives his work authenticity.

He doesn’t lecture; he shares. [His writing has the energy](https://tetra-links.com/bookfunnel-ba000-official) of someone who understands what it means to **find motivation after burnout** and gently helps you do the same. My yoga instructor friend **Olivia H**, said it best: “He writes like someone who’s fallen apart, cleaned up the pieces, and found a way to laugh about it.”



# 💡 What Makes It Different

Instead of sugarcoating discomfort, Kharabanda shows how to **use pain and adversity as motivation**. The concept of “painuation” reframes hardship into usable energy. Think of it as emotional recycling - turning your worst days into creative fuel.

His tone is friendly and sometimes witty, making the book feel personal. You’re guided to face setbacks instead of running from them. This method helps with **rebuilding confidence after setbacks** because it normalizes failure as part of progress.



# 📖 Content & Reading Experience

This book reads like a chat with a self-aware friend who’s over self-help clichés. It’s quick, conversational, and filled with lightbulb moments. The **short motivational audiobook for self-improvement** version feels natural, like someone talking you through your thoughts.

Each chapter ends with reflection prompts and **personal development worksheets for daily habits**, which are simple but surprisingly effective. You’ll find yourself writing more than reading at times, which is the point - it’s [active self-reflection](https://tetra-links.com/bookfunnel-ba000-official).



# 🧠 Practical Takeaways & Tools

The best part? It’s built around habit-forming action. Instead of complex plans, you’ll learn to **take consistent action every day** through tiny, repeatable steps. The exercises help you pause, reflect, and act - without overthinking.

You’ll start noticing moments where frustration becomes focus. That’s what makes it a **practical guide for self-improvement** rather than a pep talk in book form. It’s clear, it’s doable, and it feels grounded.



# 👥 Who It’s For

If you’re burned out, second-guessing yourself, or staring at the ceiling at 2 a.m. wondering what happened to your drive, this one’s for you. It’s especially good if you’ve been trying to **overcome burnout through reflection and action** instead of sheer willpower.

It’s ideal for busy professionals, students, or anyone wanting a gentle but real approach to personal growth. Olivia said she found it “like a life coach in paperback - minus the judgment and hourly rate.”



# 💬 Personal Experience (Told by My Friend, Olivia H)

My friend **Olivia** is a yoga instructor and part-time wellness coach I met during a retreat in Big Sur a few years back. She’s the kind of person who radiates calm - until she’s stuck in her own head, which, ironically, happens a lot. Between managing clients, teaching classes, and keeping her online wellness blog alive, she’d been feeling totally drained and confessed she’d lost her spark. That’s when I suggested she try [Challenge Life – Explore – Give – Enjoy](https://tetra-links.com/bookfunnel-ba000-official).

A week later, she texted me, “I think this book just called me out.” She told me that Kharabanda’s idea of **using pain and adversity as motivation** made her rethink how she’d been running from discomfort. Instead of avoiding her burnout, she started journaling through the “painuation” exercises, turning those restless thoughts into clarity.

She said her favourite part was how the book encourages small but consistent steps  -  things she could do between teaching classes. “It’s like therapy without the clipboard,” she joked. Her only tiny gripe was that some exercises felt repetitive after a while, but she shrugged it off: “Maybe I just needed to hear it twice.”

Two weeks later, Olivia told me she’d revived her blog with a new post titled *‘How I Stopped Letting Burnout Boss Me Around.’* And honestly? That alone felt like proof that the book’s lessons really do work.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I’m not sure if I’m allowed to post this here so take it down if not, so sorry. 

Black Bean Coffee is looking for a new team! I am the current manager, and my two roommates are the baristas. Our lease is ending and we’re all having to move away, but we are really going to miss this job and want it to be in good hands! 

I opened the business with the owner in may, and my focus has been on high quality, craft coffee. I have made all the recipes for our unique house made syrups, and I believe that’s what sets us apart from other local shops. The business is still getting up and running, so we’re slow at the moment, but I have a lot of hope! Black Bean is a safe space that is black owned, and it needs a team of kind self starters who have a passion for coffee! We love our regulars, so we would like a team who can appreciate them as well. 

If this seems like a decent fit pm me or drop off your resume at the shop. Baristas make $16.25-$18 and managers make salary 50-60k with pto and health benefits. 

Usually it is 2 part time baristas, 1 working Monday and Tuesday and the other working Wednesday-Friday, and these shifts alternate weekly. This can be changed to fit the team. Tips daily for one barista are $25-$60! Weekly pay!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

If you're reading this, don't go to Älvskog","I know this sounds like every creepypasta opening ever, but I swear on everything I hold dear this really happened. I'm posting because I need answers. Maybe someone here knows this place.

My girlfriend Sarah and I have been serious hikers for eight years. We've done winter sections of the Appalachian Trail, the Tour du Mont Blanc in November, countless cold-weather trips across Europe. We're not beginners who get spooked by every shadow or scared off by harsh conditions.

Three weeks ago, Sarah came home from work looking frustrated.

""My coworker Magnus is such an ass,"" she said, dropping her bag by the door. ""Spent the whole lunch break bragging about his 'secret hiking spots' in Sweden.""

Magnus was this pretentious guy from Sarah's office. Swedish expat who never missed a chance to remind everyone how much better things were back home. Always going on about authentic experiences and how tourists ruined everything.

""What did he say this time?"" I asked.

""Oh, the usual. How we Americans only know the touristy trails. How there are places in northern Sweden that foreigners will never find because they're not on any maps."" She rolled her eyes. ""Then he goes, 'There's this village called Älvskog where my grandmother used to live. Coordinates 67.2456°N, 20.1832°E. But you'd never survive the real winter wilderness up there.'""

I looked up from my laptop. ""He actually gave you coordinates?""

""Yeah, probably figured I'd never bother checking. Asshole was practically daring me to prove him wrong.""

That's Sarah for you. Tell her she can't do something, and she'll move mountains to prove you wrong. It's what I love about her, though it occasionally gets us into trouble.

We checked Google Maps. Nothing at those coordinates except green space marked as forest. I searched ""Älvskog Sweden"" but got no results. Even Swedish tourism websites had never heard of it.

""Magnus is probably full of shit,"" I said. ""Making up coordinates to mess with you.""

But Sarah wasn't convinced. Over the next few days, she kept bringing it up. ""What if he's telling the truth? What if there really are places that haven't been discovered by tourism yet?""

She had a point. Our last three winter hiking trips had been exercises in frustration. Overcrowded trails, reserved mountain huts, tourists in designer winter gear who had no business being in serious backcountry.

""Look,"" Sarah said one evening, ""worst case scenario, we drive up there and find nothing. Then at least I can tell Magnus his coordinates were bogus and wipe that smug look off his face.""

""And best case?""

""Best case, we find an amazing winter hiking area that nobody knows about.""

Two weeks later, Sarah had convinced me. We booked time off work and planned a three-day winter trek to those coordinates. Late October in northern Sweden meant snow, sub-zero temperatures, and only a few hours of daylight. But we had proper gear: four-season tent, winter sleeping bags rated to -20°C, snowshoes, crampons, enough food for five days.

""You sure about this?"" I asked as we loaded our car. ""Eight hours to potentially nowhere for a winter camping trip based on some office gossip?""

Sarah grinned, her breath misting in the cold morning air. ""Come on, when's the last time we had a real winter adventure? Not knowing what we'll find is half the fun.""

October 23rd, we drove north from Stockholm. Eight hours to Luleå, then smaller roads heading into Norrbotten county. The landscape changed gradually. Forests became denser, houses more scattered, roads narrower. Snow started falling around noon, thick flakes that stuck to our windshield. After Luleå, we were essentially driving through winter wilderness.

My phone lost signal around 2 PM. Sarah's GPS kept recalculating our route, trying to redirect us back to the E4 highway. But we followed her printed coordinates, using compass bearings when the road signs disappeared entirely under accumulating snow.

""This is insane,"" I muttered, navigating another hairpin turn on the narrow road that was now more ice than gravel. ""We're in the middle of a snowstorm.""

""That's the point,"" Sarah replied, but I noticed she'd stopped looking excited and started gripping the door handle.

The further north we went, the more primal everything felt. The trees were massive, ancient pines and spruces laden with snow that must have been growing for centuries. Their trunks were thick as car bodies, bark deeply grooved and blackened. Between them, snow had accumulated in deep drifts, creating a pristine white carpet that muffled all sound except our engine.

The silence was what struck me most. Our car engine sounded obscenely loud, like we were violating something sacred. No bird calls, no wind through branches despite the falling snow. Just oppressive quiet broken only by our tires crunching through snow and ice.

""It's too quiet,"" Sarah said, voicing my thoughts. ""Even in winter, there should be some animal sounds.""

""Maybe we're just not used to real wilderness,"" I replied, but even I didn't believe it.

Around 4 PM, with daylight already fading, we crested a small hill and saw it: a hand-carved wooden sign nearly buried in snow, weathered gray with age. We had to brush off the snow to read it. ""Älvskog 2 km."" The letters were cut deep, filled with what looked like old pitch to make them stand out.

""Holy shit,"" Sarah whispered, her breath forming a cloud in the frigid air. ""Magnus wasn't lying.""

""I hate that guy, but I'm impressed,"" I admitted.

The final two kilometers wound through the thickest forest yet. Snow-laden branches hung so low they scraped our car roof. Twice I had to stop and clear fallen branches that blocked the road. The snow was getting deeper, and I was starting to worry about getting stuck.

""This doesn't feel like a road people use regularly,"" Sarah observed.

""Maybe they don't get visitors often. Especially not in winter.""

Then the trees opened up, and we were there.

Älvskog sat in a white clearing like something from a fairy tale. Maybe fifteen buildings scattered around a rough circle, all nearly buried under snow. Traditional Swedish architecture, red wooden houses with white trim, steep metal roofs designed to shed snow loads. But everything was old. The wood weathered to deep burgundy, the metal roofs showing rust stains where they weren't covered by snow, and several buildings had icicles hanging like teeth from their eaves.

What bothered me immediately was how quiet it was. No cars, no machinery, no voices. But thin streams of smoke rose from several chimneys, so people were definitely home, keeping warm against the bitter cold.

Sarah parked in front of the largest building, our tires crunching in snow that had to be knee-deep. A wooden sign read ""Värdshus,"" Swedish for inn. Below it, in smaller letters: ""Björnklo.""

""Should we go in?"" she asked, already shivering despite our winter gear.

""We drove eight hours through a snowstorm. We need somewhere warm to sleep.""

The inn's windows were small and set deep in thick walls, glowing with warm light. Candles or oil lamps, not electricity. The front door was heavy timber reinforced with iron bands, clearly built to keep out the cold.

We sat in the car for a moment, engine ticking as it cooled in the frigid air.

""This feels wrong,"" I said quietly, watching our breath fog the windows.

""Like we're intruding on something private,"" Sarah agreed, pulling her winter hat down over her ears.

But we'd come this far, and the temperature was dropping fast as night fell. Sarah took a deep breath of the sharp, cold air and opened her door.

The innkeeper who greeted us was maybe sixty-five, stocky build, wearing thick wool and fur. His face was weathered like old leather, with pale blue eyes that seemed to look right through us. Most unsettling was his expression. Not unfriendly, but resigned. Like he'd been expecting us but wasn't happy about it.

""English?"" he asked with a heavy accent, stamping snow off his boots.

""Yes,"" Sarah replied through chattering teeth. ""American. We're looking for a place to stay.""

His eyebrows rose slightly. ""American. Long way from home. In winter."" He studied us for a moment, taking in our proper winter gear. ""How you find Älvskog?""

Sarah and I exchanged glances. ""A friend gave us coordinates,"" she said carefully.

""Friend."" The word seemed to leave a bad taste in his mouth. ""What friend know about Älvskog?""

""Someone who said his grandmother used to live here,"" I explained, grateful to get inside where it was warm.

The innkeeper's expression darkened. ""Many grandmothers used to live here. Not so many now. Winter takes them."" He stepped aside reluctantly. ""Come inside. Very cold tonight. Maybe thirty below.""

The inn's interior was like stepping into another century. Low ceilings with exposed beams, thick stone walls, furniture that looked handmade. Oil lamps provided warm, flickering light. A massive stone hearth dominated one wall, fire crackling and radiating blessed heat. Everything smelled of wood smoke and age.

""I am Gunnar,"" the innkeeper said, helping us out of our snow-covered gear. ""You want rooms, yes?""

""Two rooms for two nights,"" Sarah said, already warming up near the fire. ""Actually, we're planning to hike north from here. Three days in the winter forest. We'll need somewhere to leave our car.""

Gunnar went very still. ""North. In winter.""

""Yes. We're experienced winter hikers. We have proper cold-weather equipment.""

""North is..."" he paused, searching for words. ""North is not good. Old forest. Very old. In winter..."" He shook his head. ""People freeze. People..."" He made a gesture with his hands, fingers spreading apart. ""Gone.""

I felt Sarah tense beside me. ""What do you mean, gone?""

Gunnar went to a wooden cabinet and pulled out a hand-drawn map. The village was marked as a small cluster of squares. Around it, wavy lines indicated hills and streams. But to the north was simply blank parchment.

""Here is safe,"" he said, pointing to areas west and south of the village. ""Trails marked with poles. Shelters every few kilometers. People go, people come back.""

His finger moved to the empty northern section. ""Here is gammal skog. Old forest. No trails. No shelters. In winter, trees crack like gunshots. Ice falls like knives."" He looked directly at us. ""Skogsrå lives there. Feeds in winter.""

""What's Skogsrå?"" I asked.

Gunnar struggled with the translation. ""Forest... spirit? Guardian? In summer, maybe just watches. In winter..."" He shivered despite the warm room. ""In winter, it hunts. Calls people into the cold. They follow and freeze.""

""Look,"" Sarah said, ""we appreciate the warning, but we're still interested in exploring north. We'll be very careful.""

Gunnar stared at her for a long moment. Then he sighed, a sound that seemed to carry centuries of weariness.

""I give you rooms. You eat, you rest. Tomorrow... maybe you think different when you see real cold.""

After he showed us to our rooms, Sarah and I met in the hallway. The rooms were small but wonderfully warm, with thick walls and heavy quilts on the beds.

""This place gives me the creeps,"" I whispered.

""The innkeeper's just trying to scare us,"" Sarah replied, but uncertainty flickered in her voice. ""Probably wants to keep winter hikers on the marked trails.""

""What if he's right? What if people really have frozen to death up there?""

Sarah was quiet for a moment. ""Then we'll be extra careful. But we didn't come all this way to hike the tourist trails.""

Through my small window I watched the village as the short afternoon faded to early winter darkness. A few people emerged from houses, bundled in heavy furs, carrying firewood or hauling sleds. But when they noticed us watching, they quickly went back inside.

""Did you see that?"" I called to Sarah in the next room.

""See what?""

""The way people react when they spot us. Like we're already dead.""

At dinner, Gunnar served thick reindeer stew with root vegetables and dense bread. The food was excellent, hearty and warming, perfect for the brutal cold outside. Other villagers joined us. A middle-aged woman named Astrid bundled in wool who nodded politely but spoke no English, and an elderly man called Erik who communicated entirely in Swedish and gestures.

Sarah tried making conversation about the village, how they survived the harsh winters, what they did when the snow got deep. Gunnar translated reluctantly, but the responses were vague. Yes, their families had lived here for generations. Yes, they were prepared for winter. No, they didn't get visitors in the cold months.

""How many winter visitors do you get?"" I asked.

Gunnar considered this. ""In summer, maybe five, six people each year. In winter..."" He shook his head. ""Very few. Most have sense.""

""And they all want to hike north?"" Sarah pressed.

The table went silent. Astrid and Erik exchanged meaningful looks. Gunnar stared into his stew bowl.

""Some do,"" he said quietly. ""Not all come back same way they go in. Winter changes people.""

""What does that mean?"" I asked.

Gunnar stood and began clearing dishes. ""Some places... in winter, some places should stay alone.""

After dinner we walked around the village, our boots crunching in the deep snow. Most houses were dark except for candlelight in windows. No electric lines that I could see, no satellite dishes, no modern conveniences visible anywhere. Icicles hung from every roof like prison bars.

""It really is like stepping into the past,"" Sarah mused, her breath forming clouds.

But it wasn't charming. There was an undercurrent of tension, of watchfulness. I kept feeling like we were being observed, but every time I turned around, the windows were empty except for flickering candlelight.

The forest surrounded the village completely except for the single road we'd arrived on. In daylight it had seemed merely dense. Now, in the bitter darkness, it looked impenetrable. The snow-laden trees formed a solid white and black wall perhaps fifty meters from the nearest houses, their tops invisible against the star-filled sky.

""Notice how all the houses face inward?"" Sarah pointed out, stamping her feet to keep warm.

She was right. The buildings were arranged in a rough circle, all facing the central clearing. Like they were turning their backs on the forest.

""It's like they're afraid of it,"" I said.

""Or protecting themselves from it.""

Back at the inn, Gunnar was banking the fire for the night.

""Early morning tomorrow,"" he suggested. ""I show you safe winter trails. Good skiing west to frozen lake.""

""Thank you,"" Sarah said. ""But we've planned our route north.""

Gunnar's shoulders sagged. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small carved object. A wooden pendant on a leather cord. The carving was intricate but weathered, depicting what looked like intertwined branches covered in frost.

""Old protection,"" he said, offering it to Sarah. ""My grandmother made. From birch that grew in blessed ground.""

Sarah accepted it, clearly moved. ""Thank you. This is beautiful.""

""Keep close,"" Gunnar said seriously. ""If you go north in winter... keep very close. Cold takes people fast.""

In my room that night, sleep wouldn't come despite the warmth. Outside, the wind had picked up, howling around the building and rattling the windows. Through my small pane I could see snow falling harder now, thick flakes that caught the light from the village before disappearing into the black forest beyond.

Around midnight, I thought I heard something over the wind. Voices calling, faint and distant. But when I pressed my ear to the cold window, there was only the storm.

""You awake?"" Sarah's voice came through the thin wall.

""Yeah. Can't sleep.""

""Me neither. That wind sounds like screaming.""

""We could leave in the morning. Find those western trails Gunnar mentioned.""

Sarah was quiet for a long moment. ""No. We came here for winter adventure. I'm not letting some creepy village folklore scare us off.""

""What if it's not just folklore?""

""Then we'll find out tomorrow.""

At dawn, we packed our winter gear and met for breakfast. Everything we'd need for three days in sub-zero conditions. Four-season tent, sleeping bags rated to -20°C, winter clothing layers, snowshoes, ice axes, enough food for four days in case of delays. Both our phones were fully charged, though neither had signal. My GPS unit showed our location but surrounding areas remained gray. ""Map data unavailable.""

Outside, the storm had passed, leaving the world buried under fresh powder. The temperature had to be -25°C or colder. Our breath formed instant clouds that froze and fell like tiny snow.

Gunnar served us hot coffee and porridge in silence. When we finished, he walked us to the northern edge of the village, snow crunching under our boots.

The forest began abruptly. One moment we stood in the cleared space around the houses, the next we faced a wall of snow-laden ancient trees. Massive pines and spruces, their trunks easily three meters in diameter, rising until their tops disappeared into a canopy so heavy with snow it blocked most of the pale morning light.

""No trail,"" Gunnar observed, his breath steaming.

""We don't need a trail,"" I replied, checking my compass through my mittens. ""Northeast bearing, three kilometers, then camp.""

Gunnar nodded slowly. In the harsh morning light, he looked older, more fragile. ""Remember the blessing,"" he said to Sarah, touching the pendant now hanging around her neck under her winter jacket.

We shouldered our heavy packs and strapped on snowshoes. At the very edge of the village, I turned back. The red houses looked small and vulnerable in their clearing, bright spots of color against the overwhelming white of snow and the black of the surrounding forest.

Gunnar raised his mittened hand in what might have been farewell or blessing.

We entered the winter forest.

The cold hit us immediately, despite our layers. The kind of cold that makes your lungs ache and your face go numb in seconds. Under the canopy, snow had drifted into deep banks, some reaching our waists even with snowshoes. The silence was absolute except for the crunch of our footsteps and the occasional crack of a tree contracting in the cold.

After maybe fifty meters, I looked back. The village had vanished. Not gradually obscured by trees, but simply gone, as if it had never existed.

""GPS?"" Sarah asked, her voice muffled by her balaclava.

I checked my unit with numb fingers. ""Searching for satellites,"" it read. Then: ""Position unavailable.""

""Shit,"" I muttered. ""We're completely cut off.""

Sarah pulled out her phone. ""No signal either. We're on our own.""

When I was a kid my mom made sweet tea and I drank that daily and never drank water. As I got older I lived for soda and would drink almost an entire 2 liter daily. Sometimes I would drink that plus energy drinks. Then I decided to improve my health and cut sugar and started to drink a ton of coffee instead of soda. For years now, coffee has been my vice. Anytime I leave the house I need to have coffee or I need to stop for coffee. I dont drink alcohol much anymore and I have replaced a social drink with a social cup of coffee. On top of all this caffeine I take 25mg adderall xr and sometimes a 10mg ir booster. I also take 10mg lexapro for GAD. 

Last night I had significantly less caffeine than I would normally drink and woke up this morning feeling like I was going to die. I had to take a shot of my preworkout drink with my advisor just so I could feel normal to drive into work. This is clearly a problem. The issue is I've tried to stop or switch the decaf and somehow I always end up right back to drinking excessive amounts of fully caffeinated coffee. 

I need advice on how to combat this. What I've done in the past is slowly cut the regular coffee with decaf and that has worked before but I need to make sure I can actually stick to it. Im tired of being dependent on this level of caffeine and the amount of anxiety it gives me. I love love love the taste of coffee and the routine of it so it feels so hard to want to give up. I don't have any other vices except for this. ",6,1762174720.0,adhdwomen,6,0.88,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1onb0o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1onb0o4/the_heart_tree_part_1/,THE HEART TREE - Part 1,"""You alright, Jake?"" I asked. 

I found Jake standing by the kitchen sink with his fingers digging into his scalp. This wasn't the first time I had seen him get worked up, but it was unusual for him to get this way during a house party - I had known Jake long enough that I could set my watch to when one of his screaming panic attacks would follow the day after a big social event. So whatever it was that was causing Jake such intense stress was beyond the normal self-loathing he felt as a consequence of performing as the life of the party, which some part of himself must have felt deeply compelled to do.  

""Ian,"" said Jake, looking at me as if he had just found the solution to his problem. 

He noticed me noticing the blood under his fingernails. Muttering to himself, he turned on his heel and washed his hands at the sink. 

His hands washed, he cleared his throat and turned back to face me and smiled his signature 'everything's great' smile that had no real authenticity behind it. 

""Mate,"" I said, ""What's wrong? Has something happened?"" 

Jake's eyes shot to the left, then flitted back to me. 

""I can't talk about it here,"" he said in a whisper, ""I was getting Phillip a glass of water. I'll meet you in the upstairs bathroom in a minute, okay?"" 

After I gave a slow nod to affirm that I would, Jake finished filling a glass with cold tap water and hurried back to the adjacent living room where the party was in full swing. 

I made my way upstairs, and entered the bathroom, closing the door until it was slightly ajar. 

There was slippery sweat under my armpits, and my eyes felt slightly swollen in the dark  and warm confines of the bathroom. 

I felt on edge, and overwhelmed. All I wanted to do was retreat to my bedroom at the other end of the hallway and spend the rest of the night on my own. 

With nothing but the darkness and the muffled cacophony of laughter and music rising up through the house from the downstairs living room, my thoughts began to wander. 

It had only been a week since I had returned to my university house accommodation at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and the recent events of Christmas back home in South-East London were playing on my mind. Other than spending Christmas with my family, which was always a highlight of the year, I also had an unexpected catch up with my former best friend Ewan. 

And it was the thought of Ewan, and our last encounter, that had prompted me to offer to host the house party for my university friends. Besides Jake, Ellie, and Mark, the other 'friends' of mine that were currently partying downstairs were hardly more than friendly acquaintances, who I either knew because I lived with them at my current accommodation, or because they were part of the university's board game society which I had joined in my third year. 

Ewan wasn't one of the friends at the party. He was a friend from back home who I had known since around the end of secondary school, and all throughout Sixth Form college. 

Three years ago, just before I left home for university at the relatively late age of twenty-one, Ewan had told me about his plan to go to China in order to become an English teacher there. 

I remembered asking him how long he intended to go to China for. He told me: three years. 

*Don't do that*, I had said to him, *you'll become a robot*. *You can't just up and go and leave your friends and family like that. Besides, is China really the best place you could go?*

But Ewan had made his mind up.

We hadn't spoken again until he came back to England to visit his family over the Christmas holidays that had just come and gone. Ewan had reached out and messaged me, offering to meet up and hang out, and I had jumped at the offer. 

When I saw Ewan for the first time since he had left for China, he was noticeably fatter. 

He had always been short but stocky, and because of that he had played rugby throughout his teens (which subsequently had riddled his back with unfixable spinal injuries that left him in constant mild discomfort.) But when we had met at a local restaurant, and he had waddled inside, he was noticeably overweight without any athletic stockiness to compensate. 

That had been the first sign something was majorly wrong with him. 

After an awkward hug, he joined me at the table. And then, bit by bit, he told me what had happened to him during his stay in China. 

I remembered complaining to my Mum, the only person who I could really talk to about this sort of thing back home, about all the things Ewan had told me. 

""He almost died,"" I had said to Mum, ""Because the air in China is so polluted, he ended up getting a blood clot in his nose. He got rushed to the hospital and the doctors had to take out a clot the size of a slug out of his nose.""

Mum hadn't enjoyed the grizzly details. 

""And,"" I had said, ""Because the doctors had to remove the blood clot, Ewan's completely lost his sense of smell, and he can barely breathe through his nose. The slightest bit of dust in the air anywhere he goes is unbearable for him now."" 

I had walked around with Ewan after the dinner, and any time we stopped at a bench to sit down, he would become agitated, and would sniff and twitch, and he would eventually admit defeat and we would need to carry on our way. And during all this he would bend his back to pop and crack his spine to get some relief. And between each stop and start I had to walk much slower to compensate for his congested waddling pace.

And not once during the whole conversation during our day hanging out together did he admit or make any sign of regretting having gone to China. 

Not even after having to leave behind the cat he had spent three years treating as family, only for that same cat to be abandoned by the owners whose care Ewan had entrusted it in. His Chinese girlfriend who he met at the university where he taught English had given his cat to her parents, who had promptly abandoned the cat to the streets and lied about doing so whenever the topic was brought up during phone calls.) 

That meeting with Ewan had been our friendship on fumes, and more of a reunion in honor of the good friends we once were.

*But him leaving for China hadn't been what had ended the real friendship, had it?* I thought, still sitting in the dark of the upstairs bathroom with my brooding thoughts.

*The friendship ended because he got sick of me,* I thought. 

He had said as much during our latest hang out. 

He had mentioned how he had a full week of catching up with other friends from school, all of whom I had never managed to befriend myself. 

""It's funny,"" I had said to Ewan, ""How you have so many other friends and I never got to know them.""

I had said this in a somewhat whimsical way, because I knew how much of a social outcast I had been throughout most of my school life.

""I guess people don't like feeling like they're being judged,"" Ewan had said in response. 

And that comment, more than anything else Ewan had said, had really been the final nail in the coffin for our friendship. 

It wasn't because I had noticed the self-importance with which he had made that comment. Ewan had always had an easy time making and keeping friends at school. He did so by playing the clown, and otherwise being blandly affable in any social situation. Something I knew he didn't like about himself because he had told me so. Our friendship had seemed unique in comparison, because when we talked, back in the early years of our friendship, it was hard for us to stop talking about life, the universe, and everything. 

What pissed me off about Ewan's comment was the dismissal of the idea that *judging* in and of itself was wrong. That, because I had my own point of view that differed from his that I was somehow the *judgemental one.* 

*Because I care about you?* I had thought, *Because I give a shit enough about you to try and stop you from making mistakes you'll regret for the rest of your life?* 

I imagined myself saying\*, If you had listened to me you wouldn't have had that blood cot, you wouldn't have to abandon that cat, and you wouldn't have to order the absolute hottest possible curry your local Indian takeaway because you can't taste anything with a Scoville score less than three-hundred-thousand.\* 

But I had bit my tongue and kept things as polite as I could manage, because I had figured out that as far as Ewan was concerned, my advice was worthless. 

Jake was the closest friend I had made since Ewan. 

We had met during our first year at University because we shared the same campus accommodation. Separate rooms, but the same shared living space. 

Jake was his own can of worms, perhaps more riddled with problems than Ewan. 

Jake's light thumping footsteps met my ears above the unbroken sound of laughter and shouting from the others downstairs. 

""Hello?"" said Jake.

His smiling face emerged at the ajar doorway. 

""Hey,"" I whispered.

Jake moved in, brushed by me, and moved over to the toilet. He set the lid down and sat.

""Mate, what's wrong?"" I said in a whisper.

""I can't say,"" said Jake.

""You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, mate,"" I said, ""I just want to know if you're in any kind of trouble.""

""No, it's not like that,"" said Jake, pitifully, ""It's…it's just…ugh, I can't say.""

My cheeks were fuzzy from the two large cans of energy drink I had imbibed and followed up with two regular bottles of vodka-and-lemonade. The alcohol content from the vodka-and-lemonade was so minimal there was no chance that I was drunk. But considering I rarely drank, and was therefore a major lightweight when it came to alcohol, I still felt noticeably tipsy.

Jake on the other hand had finished half a bottle of vodka on his own, and had shown very little sign of slowing down.

""Ugh,"" Jake groaned, ""I think I'm going to have a panic attack.""

""Is there anything I can do?"" I said.

Jake shook his head slowly from side to side. Muffled laughter rose and fell again from downstairs.

""Sounds like they're having fun,"" I said.

Two things happened then.

The first, was Jake began to let out an increasingly agonised whine that would soon become uncontrolled sobbing.

The second, was the sudden all-at-once arrival of a golden light so bright the only thing I thought it could be was the beginning of a nuclear bomb blast.

I had checked my phone a few minutes prior to inviting Jake to go upstairs to the bathroom with me to talk, and it had been close to 9PM around that time. It had gotten dark around 4PM, and we weren't on the side of the house which would have streetlights shining in from outside.

The new light pouring in from the bathroom window was brighter than peak daylight to the point I had to look away and shield my eyes.

Screams from the others downstairs broke out too.

And then just as Jake's sobbing reached its peak, a sound, like an explosion, reached my ears.

And it was so loud I was certain it was a bomb. It had to be. What else could make such noise? It drowned every other sound out and made it impossible to think of anything else.

Unable to see anything but bright burning gold light, and ears pierced with the catastrophically thunderous and unrelenting noise; I wondered if this was how I was going to die.

If it was a nuclear bomb, or some similar doomsday device unleashed on the populace of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England, the shockwave blast hadn't yet reached us.

One second passed after another and still the near blinding gold light and the terrible noise like thousands of drums being played right outside the house continued.

I had already pocketed my phone into my right jeans pocket, which left me with my hands free to stuff my index fingers into my ears to muffle some of the painful thundering.

The sheer unfamiliarity of what was happening had forced Jake out of his panic attack. He had his hands to his ears and his face was squinting and bathed in gold as he shouted something at me that I couldn't hear. At a guess I figured he was shouting my name.

As much as it hurt to do so, I removed the finger from my left ear and pulled down the bathroom door handle. The second I had the door open I put the finger right back because it felt as if a screwdriver were being dug into my ear canal during that brief lapse.

I inched out of the bathroom and made sure Jake was following me before continuing on. With me leading, we both inched our way down the stairs.

The house hallway was similarly bathed in gold from the biblical levels of light.

Is the house going to catch fire? I wondered.

The light was hot, like standing outside during a heatwave, which only worsened my fears that I was right – that there really had been a nuclear bomb that had gone off.

But it had been maybe thirty seconds since the light and noise had started. Would it take that long for the nuclear bomb's shockwave to reach us? And wouldn't the radiation from the light cook us all alive way before the final destructive force?

Afterimages, like negative coloured splotches, hovered over my field of vision. Even with my eyelids closed for as long as I dared to keep them shut whilst continuing down the hallway, it felt as if I had many hot lightbulbs shining in front of my face.

I reached the living room at the back of the house and saw the bulk of the others standing near the sliding glass door. There were more than a dozen of them standing there, the light making them like scorched silhouettes.

And then all at once the light stopped, as if a switch had been flicked. My vision went dark, and the splotches in front of my eyes continued to bob and roam and block me from making out much of anything around me.

Several seconds later the thundering noise stopped too. In its absence was silence pierced by a continuing shriek that I was sure was the aftermath of my eardrums suffering such brutal noise for so long, and not an actual sound to be heard.

Over the course of a few minutes the best I could do was remain off to one side of the room hoping that I wasn't going to be near deaf and blind for the rest of my life.

My hearing normalised first. The panicked crying and whimpers from some of the others in the living room met my ears. And soon after my vision adjusted to the darkness of the room, which was lit by a dim bulb light hanging from the ceiling.

I knew, because I was the one hosting the house party, that there were fifteen of us including myself in the house.

""It's a nuclear bomb!"" someone shouted.

It was Tyler.

He was very tall and gangly, with long sandy-blonde hair tied back into a ponytail. The most distinctive items Tyler had worn for this evening were white and red-striped arm warmers that matched with his red and white converse shoes, on top of his overall effeminate grunge style.

""If it's a nuclear bomb the shockwave would have hit us by now,"" I said.

""I bet you France is cooked!"" said someone else.

It was Jack. About as tall as me at five foot seven. Unlike me, he was Pakistani-Asian, whereas I was White-British.

Also like me, Jack wasn't dressed effeminately, only three other guys at the party liked to dress in a girl-ish way, and neither Jack nor I were one of them. Instead I was dressed in a button down checkered shirt and blue jeans, and Jack in a simple dark green shirt and blue jeans.

""What do you mean?"" I said.

""Isn't it obvious?"" said Jack, ""France just got bombed and that was the blast!""

""There's no way,"" came a monotone voice.

It was Ben, the other tall guy of the group. Dressed in a shabby hoodie and blue jeans, with messy short hair.

""If it was a nuclear bomb we'd all be dead.""

""So what was it?"" said Jake.

He was standing close to me, and his face, no longer bathed in gold from the light, nor the darkness from the bathroom, was instead a natural bronze from his Malaysian heritage. His scrawny body was clad in tight blue jeans and a bright pink sweater with an anime-style teddy bear depicted across the chest.

Nobody had an answer. Over on the leather couch against the rear wall two of the girls, Georgia and Megan, were sitting and holding each other's hands for support.

I found myself grinning despite the horrible pit of dread gnawing in my stomach, perhaps because this was by far the most exciting thing to ever happen in my life.

""Maybe it's an alien invasion,"" I said, half-joking.

""Ian, that ain't funny,"" said another voice.

I saw Jake whip round to look at him first. Standing at the doorway, blocking most of it with his bulk, was Mark. He was about the same height as me, but much broader on account of his dedication in the last half year or so lifting weights and eating the right foods to bulk up. He did, however, look like he had just wandered out of his bedroom because he was wearing a simple tan t-shirt and brown three-quarter-length shorts, and he was wearing his usual dorky sandals.

""Maybe it was a solar flare,"" came another voice.

Over on the couch, next to Megan, his girlfriend, was Eddie. He was a bit shorter than me, with a square-ish head and his frame drowned in an oversized hoodie. I couldn't remember what it was he was currently studying at university, but I knew it was something that required a lot of brains.

""If it was a solar flare all our phones wouldn't be working,"" said Georgia.

She was a very rotund girl with a head of long curly hair, and she also happened to be Tyler's girlfriend. Her eyes were wide open, as if she were on drugs. Her hands, still holding onto Megan's, were trembling.

Because of Georgia mentioning our phones, everyone in the room retrieved their phones to take a look. The light from all the screens filled the dimly lit living space some more.

""My phone's still working but I don't have internet,"" said Jack next to me with his phone in his hand.

Tyler let out an aggravated rasp.

""Yeah I got no internet either,"" he said.

Several of the others in the room mumbled they also had no internet on their phones. I checked my phone and, like the rest, I didn't have any internet.

""Maybe we should check outside?"" came another voice.

It was Dave, Mark's younger brother. He looked a lot like Mark except a year or so younger and without any of the benefit of having lifted weights.

""No, you're not going outside,"" said Mark, in a way that left no room for debate.

Dave listened to his brother without further rebuttal.

""So it wasn't a solar flare, probably,"" I said, ""Because the lights are still on and our phones are still working. And it wasn't a–""

I had to stop speaking to swallow, my mouth feeling incredibly parched all of a sudden, and the fear which gripped me was making it hard to catch my breath.

""--and,"" I said, once I took a moment to breathe, ""it wasn't a nuclear blast because we're all still alive. Even if it hit France or wherever I bet we'd all be dead right now.""

""What if it was something stupid?"" said Phillip from a chair in the corner of the room. Philip, like Jake, was very scrawny and even more effeminate in his mannerisms. Unlike Jake, he was also mixed-raced African.

""Like,"" he said, ""What if it was like a big firework or something?""

""That wasn't a firework,"" said Ben.

""Then what was it?"" said Georgia, and then she pointed at me, ""And don't say aliens.""

I threw my hands up mock guiltily to help lighten the serious mood. This earned a few forced laughs from some of the others in the room, if only so they could let themselves feel something other than terrible dread about whatever had happened, and perhaps was still happening.

""I don't have any signal,"" said another boy who was sitting in the large green leather armchair in the corner of the room, adjacent to where Megan and Georgia were sitting together.

It was Oscar, a portly boy with a head of balding hair despite being only around eighteen years of age.

""I don't think we can even call the police,"" he said.

Besides Oscar, was Gary, who, out of everyone in the room, seemed to be paying the least amount of attention to what had just happened. Instead, as was typical for him, he had a beer can in his hand which he contentedly drank from until the can was empty. And then he promptly started on what was likely his tenth (conservatively speaking) can of beer for the evening (any morning or afternoon drinks he might have had not included.)

I decided to walk over to the sliding glass door which, were I to open it, led to the back garden. I saw my reflection in the glass and some of the faces of the others watching me from over by the couches around the coffee table (which was swamped in both opened and unopened bottles and cans of alcohol, with plenty of mixers too.)

The living room was humid, sweaty, and stunk of alcohol. What I wanted was fresh air, but I didn't dare open the sliding glass door yet.

Instead I raised my phone to the glass and used the phone's torchlight function to see further into the veil of darkness.

Out in the back garden was the large leafless tree which must have been there for decades. Besides the tree I could see the patchy garden grass, and thorny bushes, but nothing out of the ordinary.

""Do you see anything?"" said Mark from the doorway on the other side of the room.

""Nothing abnormal,"" I said.

I put my hand on the glass, and it was then I noticed I had spoken too soon.

Something was falling in heaps outside.

Because I was shining the torchlight the others caught a glimpse of the same falling stuff before I could call it out.

Some of the guys raced to the sliding glass door and peered out, using the torchlight functions of their phones to add to mine to see what was happening outside.

""Is it ash?"" said Jack.

""It looks like ash,"" said Ben, ""But it's not.""

""How do you know?"" I said.

""Because if it was ash everything would be on fire outside,"" said Ben.

""Let's open the door and we'll be able to tell,"" said Philip.

He reached for the sliding door latch. Right away myself, Ben, and Tyler took hold of Philip's arms to stop him.

""Okay! Okay! Get off me! GET OFF!"" Philip shouted.

""Don't open the door,"" said Ben, keeping his grip on Philip like iron.

There wasn't anything personal about the way Ben said this in his usual monotone voice. But he was panicking like the rest of us.

""I won't, get off,"" said Philip.

Ben let him go, and so did the rest of us who had taken hold of Philip – for his protection and our own.

""The air could be poisoned,"" said Jack, ""We better not risk it.""

""Is everyone okay?"" came a new voice.

It was Ellie. She was one of my housemates, and had simply been doing her own thing in her room when all the commotion began. She had her usual glasses on, and was in her pajamas.

""We're okay,"" I said, ""We're just trying to figure out what all of that even was.""

""It was mad, init?"" said Ellie, ""I nearly shat myself when it started.""

What she just said earned another round of nervous laughter from most of the people in the room.

""D'you think it was thunder and lightning?"" said Ellie.

""Maybe,"" said another voice.

This time it was Megan. Her voice was quivering from stress. Her hands gripping hold of Georgia's just as much as Georgia was gripping hers.

""It started with just light,"" said Megan, freeing one of her hands to adjust her glasses, only to put her hand right back to firmly gripping Georgia's again, ""And then the light came a few seconds later. Just like thunder and lightning. But way bigger.""

It was then I noticed the white puff of air leaving my mouth. The day had started cool, but not cold. And even over the recent Christmas period it hadn't been cold enough to be more than chilly.

Everyone in rapid succession noticed their breaths catching in the air too. Not only that, we could all feel the temperature dropping.

A cracking noise began to fill the air, and it was then those of us closest to the sliding glass door noticed frost climbing all over the glass.

I placed my hand against the glass and immediately noticed how cold it was.

""How is it getting so cold?"" said Philip, ""The glass is frosting up!""

Ellie joined those of us who were standing at the sliding glass door.

""This is bad,"" she said, ""The temperature shouldn't be dropping like this.""

It was strange seeing genuine fear from Ellie. It simply wasn't an emotion I had ever seen from her, besides one time I pulled a particularly good prank on her. She was, perhaps second only to Jake or Mark, the person I was closest to in the whole house.

""Oh gosh,"" said Jake, suddenly.

He began to race to the doorway where Mark was standing off to the side from where he had moved to let Ellie in.

""Jake, where are you going?"" I said.

""Rebecca,"" said Jake, ""She's still in her room. I'm going to check on her.""

Jake didn't wait for a response. Philip, his best friend since they were little, hurried after him. I decided to stay where I was.

I began to shiver, my teeth chattering. I wasn't dressed at all for the cold. What sweaty humidity had been in the room before was gone.

It was then Gary rose from his spot on one of the couches and, with a beer in his hand, he raised a toast to everyone.

""Well,"" he said, in his usual slurred speech, ""If this is the end of the world, at least it's going down at a party. Cheers!""

He chugged the entirety of the beer, dropped the can to the carpet, and crushed it underfoot.

""Hey!"" I shouted, ""Don't mess up my carpet!""

Gary looked both genuinely shocked at realising the bad of what he had just done, but also as if he were only half-awake.

""Sorry, sorry,"" he slurred, ""I won't do it again, I'm very sorry.""

I took a deep breath, which felt crisp and cold as if I had minty chewing gum in my mouth.

""It's fine,"" I said, ""Just be respectful, mate. Any damages me and the rest of the housemates are going to have to pay for it.""

""Come here, it's alright,"" Gary slurred.

He stepped closer and embraced me in a hug. He reeked of booze and cigarettes; two smells which immediately brought my Dad to mind. I patted Gary on the back a few times to let him know there were no hard feelings, and eased away from him.

""Piss it!"" someone shouted from the kitchen.

It was Mark.

Most of the others in the living room were busy checking their phones, trying to get any signal to make contact with the wider world. Others continued to peer out to the garden, where the newly falling snow – that had to be what it was – was falling with entrancing Yuletide heaviness.

Which left just Ellie, Jack, and me, as the ones who hurried out of the living room at a brisk walking pace into the adjacent kitchen, which was just to the left down the hallway.

Ellie was the first to enter, followed by me, and then Jack behind me. We arrived just in time to see Mark cursing several times as he wound the top hung windows shut using the hand levers.

Even from the other side of the kitchen, which was about three-to-four strides in width, the cold blowing in from the windows was like pain in aerosol form.

Mark shoved his hands under his armpits to get them warm, his face winced in pain.

""You okay?"" said Ellie.

""Yeah, great,"" said Mark, sarcastically.

Then Ellie gasped. Before I could ask why she took a small piece of white plastic away from where it was set on the lime-green kitchen wall. It was a piece of plastic I had never cared to notice before.

""It's below zero degrees centigrade in the house,"" said Ellie, both amazed and panicked.

""How cold is it exactly?"" said Mark.

""This thermometer doesn't go lower than zero,"" said Ellie.

""You know what?"" said Jack from behind me.

The rest of us looked over to him.

""What if this is like in Millennium Warcry?"" He said, ""In the Millennium Warcry books there are these portals – warp gates – that open up. They require a vast amount of energy to open. They can make the weather go haywire.""

""So aliens after all, then?"" I said.

Jack, like Ellie, also looked both panicked and excited.

""It'd be more like interdimensional space demons,"" said Jack, ""Though to use Warp Energy usually requires mass sacrifice of millions of innocent souls.""

""Well,"" I said, ""We'll add that to the list of possibilities.""

""Hey, I'm just saying, it could be,"" said Jack.

""Yeah, yeah,"" I said, ""There's just a bit of a gap between a solar flare or nuclear bomb, compared to, you know, interdimensional hell demons. But hey, if you're right, I'll give you five quid.""

""Really?"" said Jack, ""How about twenty?""

I shrugged.

""Deal,"" I said.

We shook hands on it. This was fine with me, I didn't expect interdimensional hell demons to be the likely cause, but I did want to keep the mood among everyone in the house light-hearted.

""You know, it could be global warming?"" said Dave, who was peering in from the doorway.

""It's not global warming you idiot,"" said Mark.

""Okay,"" said Dave, ""Just thought it might be. Makes more sense than a sodding Warp Gate. No offense, Jack.""

""Hah,"" Jack laughed, ""It's cool.""

""Crap,"" I said.

I'd just realised something.

""Ian?"" said Ellie.

I turned to her and Mark.

""Can you both make sure everything is sealed inside the kitchen and living room? No air gaps to let the cold in? If it gets any colder we're all going to be in serious trouble.""

""Yeah,"" said Mark.

""Yeah, good idea,"" said Ellie.

""Good,"" I said, ""I'll make sure upstairs doesn't have any obvious gaps.""

""Erm,"" said Dave, from the doorway again, ""Maybe we should get blankets and stuff for people down here? It's cold.""

""We know it's cold,"" said Mark, ""But yeah, good idea. We'll see to that after.""

It was hard not to notice how happy Dave looked to receive a positive affirmation from his brother for a change. I felt a little relieved about it too.

Mark and Ellie, joined by Jack and Dave, set to work making sure any and all ways for the cold to get into the house from the ground floor was blocked.

With that being handled, I hurried upstairs to do the same for the other rooms. I had hoped the motion of running up the stairs would have warmed me up some, instead it made me that much more aware of how not dressed for the cold I was.

Alone after reaching the top of the stairs, without the warmth of the others around me, the whole situation seemed far bleaker and scarier. Goosebumps spread over my arms, and my socked feet were numbing from the cold.

Before I could reach my room, which was the room at the far end of the hallway from the stairs, I stopped at the doorway adjacent to my room – which was Rebecca's bedroom.

Inside the room were Jake and Philip, who were kneeling on the ground with Rebecca who was sitting like an overweight panda wearing a pink onesie between them.

And it was then I noticed Jake was busy trying to pull a loosened noose cord away from Rebecca's neck. Her neck, which looked raw and bruised from the cord already having dug hard around her throat.

Rebecca's eyes were open but also downturned, as if she were close to falling asleep. For several surreal moments I simply stood and stared at Rebecca – because I couldn't see if she was breathing.

Finally, I noticed the rise and fall of her chest, and then several hampered coughs escaping her.

I looked around the hallway to see if anyone else might have followed me up the stairs. It was a needless gesture, but I did it anyway just to be sure.

I then moved into Rebecca's bedroom.

Again, I couldn't find the words to ask what had happened, and was happening with Rebecca.

The three of them took notice of me.

""It's okay,"" said Jake, ""Rebecca just had an accident.""

""Accident?"" I said in a whisper.

There was an accusation in my tone because, right there above Rebecca's head where she was sitting, was the noose cord tied to the doorknob of her wardrobe.

Jake finished removing the noose from around Rebecca's neck, and from the wardrobe doorknob.

""Stay with her?"" said Jake, to Philip.

""Don't go,"" Rebecca whined in a tiny voice.

""I'll be right back,"" said Jake.

He patted Rebecca's thigh and then stood quickly and hurried over to the bedroom doorway.

""Want to go to my room?"" I whispered.

""Yeah,"" said Jake.

He closed Rebecca's door behind him and then we moved into my bedroom. I closed the door. I noticed also that my bedroom window was already shut, making there no need to close it. My bedroom was on the side of the house where the streetlights could shine in from the window. They were shining in, but much fainter due to the sheer volume of falling snow outside. Or at least, it was what I assumed was snow.

""What's going on with Rebecca?"" I whispered, ""Did she just try and–"" I struggled to find the right words yet again, ""--take her own life?""

""Mhm,"" Jake mumbled.

Then, after an uncomfortable silence, he whispered, ""It's not the first time she's done this.""

""What?"" I said, alarmed.

""I know, I know,"" said Jake, ""Usually she just does it because she wants attention. She has mood swings. The other times she's done this all she needs is some food and drinks she likes and some company.""

""Are you nuts?"" I said, struggling to stop myself from yelling, ""She had a noose around her neck, man.""

""I know,"" said Jake, ""I didn't know what to do. The university already knows about it. She's been going to counseling sessions.""

""Mate,"" I said, ""Don't you think this was something you might have wanted to mention to me? My room is right next to hers.""

""I know,"" said Jake, again, ""But I didn't want to make things worse for her. She promised me not to tell anyone else about it.""

My head started to spin. I sat on my bed, which was unmade and littered with the clothes I had tried on and decided weren't the kind of fashion I wanted to wear for the party.

""So she just tried to take her life?"" I said.

""I don't think she was really trying,"" Jake whispered, ""I know it sounds bad but it's more of an attention thing.""

""You said that,"" I said.

""The big explosion outside shocked her,"" said Jake.

""Shocked her?"" I said.

""No, not shock-shocked,"" said Jake, ""She was getting herself ready and then the explosion startled her and then she actually started to – you know. All the other times she just sort of sits there with the noose around her neck. She texts me what she's doing and then I come and help her.""

""Jake,"" I groaned.

""It's fine, it's fine,"" said Jake, ""It's all fine. Just leave it to me and Philip. Please don't tell anyone, okay? Please.""

There was a pause. Not because I was deliberating what to do, but because I simply felt overwhelmed with everything that was already happening. The big golden explosion, or whatever it was, was bad enough. Though Rebecca and I were certainly not close and in fact didn't like each other all that much, the idea that she had just attempted suicide, and in fact had toyed with attempting suicide several times before was simply beyond the pale.

""Okay,"" I said, finally, ""Does she need anything? There's a first aid kit under the kitchen sink.""

""No, she's fine. She just has a sore neck,"" said Jake.

Jake opened my bedroom door.

""I need to get back to her,"" he said, ""Thanks for understanding.""

""Wait,"" I said.

Jake stopped.

""Yeah?"" he said.

""Was this what you were trying to tell me about?"" I said.

Jake shook his head from side to side and whispered, ""No.""

""You want to tell me now?"" I said.

""Later,"" he said, ""It's not important right now.""

Jake then made his way back into Rebecca's room and closed the door behind him.

I let out a ragged sigh.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

2. I heat up the portafilter by passing water through it.
3. I put the coffee in the portafilter basket and break up clumps with a needle tool.
4. I tamp with the tamper that I got with the machine (I am planning to upgrade this). I have tamped both light and heavy.
5. I pull a shot of about 1:2 coffee to water ratio, so 34-36 grams.

 The shots I pull mostly seem to the slightly watery side, but has a layer of crema. They taste very strong and quite bitter.

1onaw1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1onaw1f/my_stepdad_died_on_my_wedding_day_but_it_was_my/,"My stepdad died on my wedding day, but it was my bridesmaids who ruined my wedding","My stepdad passed away the morning of my wedding, which was devastating. But even with the grief, my bridesmaids made the day about themselves. They left me out, started drama, and behaved selfishly. I can’t look back on my wedding without feeling hurt and betrayed. How do I move on and reclaim the day?

I never imagined my wedding day would be overshadowed by heartbreak and yet, here I am.

This is a throw away account and I did change names and such so those involved don't find this or realize it is about them. 

I’m Sasha (30F), and my husband Cameron (28M) and I just got married a couple of months ago. We’d been dreaming about our wedding for years, and I envisioned a warm, fun, stress-free day surrounded by my closest friends and family. But instead, what should have been the happiest day of my life was overshadowed by a tragedy and betrayal from the people I trusted most.

The tension started long before the wedding. I had seven bridesmaids: my sister Heather, my best friends Francesca and Gabby, four sorority sisters Abby, Carly, Beatrice, and Giselle. Some lived nearby, some far away, and I often found myself putting in the effort to maintain our friendships while a few of them rarely reciprocated.

Fast forward to my bachelorette. I’d hoped for a relaxing beach weekend in San Diego with my girls, a chance to laugh and connect before the wedding. My husband and I did a conjoined trip so we could have the wedding party get to know one another before the big day. Francesca couldn’t make it because of her kids, and Beatrice never responded about attending. I had a vision for the weekend, and though Abby offered to help plan games, I mostly handled everything myself (I wanted to plan it, so no hard feelings there).

However, things went off the rails immediately. Carly and Abby kept doing their own thing without us. Running in the mornings to explore and grabbing coffee and breakfast without us, telling us what they wanted to do and shooting down my ideas and plans, etc. When I suggested dinner plans or fun activities, they dismissed me or made it about themselves. At one point, Carly even brought a white dress to wear while exploring, and I tried to gently mention that I felt weird since it was my bachelorette and I’d planned to wear white. She acted annoyed but ultimately chose a different outfit.

The final straw was dinner the last night of the trip. I got ready early to enjoy some time with my husband and his friends while the others went back down on the beach. Since I didn't want to go back into the water I chose to get dressed and instead of being alone I chose to have a drink with the guys upstairs. The guys and girls stayed on different floors of the beach house. When the girls came back in to get ready, Abby and Carly asked me if I was ready to go. I said not yet because I had just opened a drink. They insisted they needed to go early to get a table so I said okay. Well little did I know, they told the rest of my girls that I wanted to hang with the guys and that they should go with them. So they left me. Whatever, I figured miscommunication. But, after dinner they drove off without me again telling the girls I would just ride back with the guys. I finally caught up with them, and later found out Abby also complained that I didn’t pay for everyone’s expensive seafood dinner. At the beginning of the trip I offered to buy pizza for the girls as a thank you for coming, not an expensive seafood dinner we all agreed to go to. 

By the end of the weekend, I felt hurt, excluded, and disrespected. My loving now husband saw how upset I was and told me that these were toxic behaviors, but I brushed it off. I wanted to believe in my friends.

Then came the wedding itself. The week leading up to it was chaotic: last-minute errands, coordinating a DIY setup, and dealing with family stress. My family got the news days before my wedding that my stepdad was going to go on hospice for his cancer. Obviously bad timing on the universe, but my mom still tried to be present for me. I was heartbroken. I wasn't very close with my stepdad as they got together while I was an adult, but he was still an important presence in my life. My mom loved him with all her heart so it was also hard to watch her lose her love. I tried to help support my mom while she was trying to help me with wedding prep. She flew to my house and I held her many days while she cried and tried to be okay. None of us knew it would be so quick. They said months, which turned into weeks, but sadly he passed in a matter of days.

Even with the tragedy of him being on hospice, my bridesmaids acted a fool and showed their true colors the night before the wedding.

Abby immediately started dictating how the decorations should be set up, telling the groomsmen to follow her instructions perfectly. Carly chimed in, threatening that I’d be upset if anything was wrong. Beatrice and Abby insisted on not making breakfast until the morning of because they simply didn't want to do it the night before. I said I would do it and they told me no they would handle it in the morning before everyone woke up. But, it did not get done in time and then they stressed to get it all done and threw it back in my face later that it was too much to do in the morning.  All of this aside I tried to stay calm, grateful for the help I was getting, but I felt increasingly isolated.

The morning came and instead of feeling bubbly and happy, I was stressed and heartbroken. My mom texted me the news early that morning that my stepdad had passed away. I felt so sad and wanted to cry but I was in the middle of having my bridal make up done. I had a lot of emotions. Fear of what the day would bring. Heartache for my mom and what she must be going through, especially with not being by his side. I tried to hold it inside and just move forward with the day. 

I told the bridesmaids of the news before my mom came to get ready with us and we took a moment of silence. No one really said much after that. My husband was texting me (because we hadn't done our first look yet) all morning making sure I was okay. I stayed pretty quiet and tried to finish and just complete my tasks. I asked bridesmaids to help with small things, make me a bagel, help set up drink pitchers, etc, nothing outrageous. This was met with some dirty glances and hesitation to help. Some even complained behind my back, comparing my wedding to Carly’s months prior, saying I wasn't grieving properly, and even going as far as calling me a bitch and a bridezilla for not having a seating chart for my micro wedding of 60 people (for context we had 3 long tables of 20 and let people sit wherever so we could all feel like one big family. All food was on the table family style.)

4 days after the wedding, Abby launched into a rampage of complaints via text. She claimed I needed to apologize to my parents, that I barked orders at the bridesmaids, that I hadn’t thanked them properly, and more. For the record, I did thank them Friday before the wedding and the day after the wedding but was told the day after the wedding was too late to say thank you. She even asked if I was taking my medication and seeing a therapist insinuating she thinks I am manic and have been for 2 years. This was a completely uncalled-for and offensive question/statement. When I asked for specifics, she couldn’t provide any.

My husband was by my side through the whole ordeal. I then reached out to the other bridesmaids as well as some of my husbands groomsmen, who confirmed what I already knew: I hadn’t done anything wrong. My friends Francesca, Gabby, Giselle, and my sister Heather reassured me that I’d handled the day normally, given the stress, tragedy and grief of the week. They didn’t share any of Abby’s claims. They all actually gave me more clarity of worse things she did and said.

Even after I tried to address the situation with a long, thoughtful message, Abby responded by cutting me off entirely! She removed me from her wedding group chat (she is getting married herself soon), blocked me, and responded to my message saying “I don't have to read this to know we no longer share the same values. I'm done."" 

Carly then complained about logistics like having to get an airbnb because we didn't have enough space in the house for significant others, just the wedding party to stay at. We didn't charge anyone in the party to stay at the house, we covered the cost. We just did not have enough space in the house to have them and all of their significant others. So, we said (a year in advance mind you) that they could get a room at a hotel or all join in as a group for an airbnb if their significant others were joining. They also did not have to stay at the house if they chose to stay with their significant other. Some had their significant others join day of instead and/or their significant other just couldn't come anyway. She also said I told them all they needed to take off work Friday before the wedding. I never did, I gave them all the plans and lists of decor and everything weeks in advance. Explained many times what was in my planning binder and sent them everything to look over. I just asked them to be at the place by 5pm so we could go over stuff but if you couldn't then to just let me know so I can re run it with you later just not outside where the stuff is since it would be dark later and it was an outdoor wedding. I also ended up saying that it didn't matter what time they got there anymore because due to Carly's error as our officiant, we had to get legally married at the courthouse the night before our scheduled wedding because she was not legally able in the state we were having the wedding. She apologized and I didn't mind, but we would be at the courthouse at 5pm so it didn't matter anymore what time people arrived. She also compared my wedding to her wedding (where all the bridesmaids and their significant others DID have to pay to stay at the house and we had to stay there and pay per person.) Many double standards made on her part. 

Beatrice stayed silent but did nothing to support me. For the record, we are not close. Abby guilt tripped me to have Beatrice in the wedding saying Beatrice would feel left out. She is Abby and Carly's friend and was more of my acquaintance. We never really talked without Abby and Carly.

I blocked all three of them. I realized that the friendships I thought I had were gone and had become toxic, and the wedding that was supposed to be joyful had been poisoned by their selfishness and manipulations.

The rest of my bridesmaids Francesca, Gabby, Heather, and Giselle have been incredible! We talk almost daily, visit each other, and support one another. Without them, I don’t know how I’d have processed all of this. They enlightened me with way more information after the fact telling me what more was said behind my back with all the knife twists to my back by those 3 toxic girls. My husband is the most amazing man, we have been together for 5 years and he truly is the best partner. He loves me unconditionally and is my rock!

Now, months later, I still feel a pang of sadness when I look at my wedding photos. I remember moments when I should have felt joy, only to recall being excluded, ignored, or undermined by the people I trusted most. I also feel so much sadness for the passing of my stepdad and how my mom and I really did not have those magical mother daughter moments like we were supposed to have. I want to reclaim my memories and focus on the love and happiness I share with my husband, immediate family, and supportive friends.

Sometimes I think about asking the photographer if we could pay them to photoshop the toxic bridesmaids out of the pictures. Sometimes I think about a small vow renewal next year, just us and a few people who truly care about us. But I don’t know where to go from here. How do I look back on my wedding day and feel happiness instead of heartbreak? How do I forgive myself for letting these people ruin what should have been one of the best day of my life?",1,1762174258.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Kaya ko naman, kaso may times kasi na sobrang busy, nag sasabi naman ako sa kaniya but nag tatampo siya then sasabihin niya na ""may iba ka na"", ""alam ko naman na may iba kang kausap"",  lagi ko siyang ina assure na wala. 

Then, dumating sa part na nanliligaw na siya, minsan nakakatulugan ko siya sa sobrang pagod pero nag sasabi naman ako na inaantok na ko, he will keep on messaging me until di na ko nag rereply tapos pag gising ko, ang makikita kong messages niya is ""sorry titigil na 'ko"", ""alam ko namang wala kang pake sakin"", ""di na ko mang gugulo"".

Alam ko dapat nakipag communicate ako imbis na maging cold pero wala na kasi talaga kong gana😭. Then ayun na nga, siya na nag sabi na mag stop na kami, pumayag ako, nag sorry and sabi ko makakahanap din siya ng mas better. 

2 days after that, may md na siyang ibang girl,  medyo na hurt ako kasi nga may feelings pa ko for him that time pero syempre ni let go ko na eh, ano pang karapatan ko don te? Hinayaan ko lang until in-unfriend ko siya. May ""concerned"" people na nag me-message sa'kin with ss ng stories niya na naka public, akala daw nila kami nung guy so sinend nila sa akin.

Then another one, one of my friends naman told me na iba nanaman nga, so sa isang buwan or 2 weeks lang ata, tatlong babae yung naka md sa kaniya publicly. Natatawa na lang ako kasi may gut feel na rin ako na baka kaya niya sinasabi sakin na baka may iba ako is baka ginagawa niya sa'kin. Medyo na prove yon ng actions niya. May posts pa nga siya sa fb na sobrang exaggerated like, naging kami raw pero ganto ginawa ko ganyan, which is not true, kase nga di ko naman siya sinagot te, naging honest naman ako nung nag part kami ng ways and he said na naintindihan niya raw ako🙄

Then, nung naging available na maging public yung notes messenger be, nag notes ako for fun ng ""kape kape kape"" something like that, parang tanga diba.

Since then, they’ve basically become part of my daily routine and have survived just about every form of abuse imaginable.

They’ve been tossed into hiking packs, clanged around in the trunk on road trips, dropped onto concrete, and even gone through a few rounds in the dishwasher when I got lazy. The paint is a bit chipped around the rims now, but there’s no rust, no cracks, and they still hold coffee as perfectly as the day I bought them.

I’ve used them for hot drinks, soup, oatmeal, and even as makeshift measuring cups when camping. There’s something deeply satisfying about how indestructible they feel — no plastic taste, no glass to shatter, no nonsense.

It’s funny how a simple $8 mug has outlasted every “premium” travel tumbler or ceramic mug I’ve owned. Definitely one of those Buy It For Life kind of items I never expected to appreciate this much.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Maybe something for keeping milk cool, a comfy carrier for longer walks, or a compact diaper bag that actually fits everything without feeling bulky.  
  
Would love to hear what other parents found helpful for solo dad-and-baby outings, what made your trips smoother (and meltdown-free)?",1,1762173703.0,breastfeeding,0,0.99,False
1onaokx,https://www.reddit.com/r/recedinghairline/comments/1onaokx/the_sciencebacked_daily_routine_for_maximizing/,"The Science-Backed Daily Routine for Maximizing Treatment Results – Exact Timing, Application Techniques, and Common Mistakes to Avoid","Most people waste months of potential progress due to improper application timing and technique. Here's a comprehensive guide to structuring an effective daily hair loss treatment routine based on research and optimal practices.

**THE OPTIMAL MORNING ROUTINE:**

**6:30-7:00 AM Window (Adjust to your schedule):**

**Minoxidil Application:**

* Apply to completely DRY scalp (critical: wet scalp dilutes the solution and reduces absorption)
* Use exactly 1mL of 5% minoxidil solution
* Systematic application approach:
   * Part hair to expose scalp sections
   * Apply directly to scalp (not hair strands)
   * Front hairline and temples: Focus on affected areas
   * Crown: Even distribution across thinning area
   * Use fingertips to spread gently without aggressive rubbing
* Allow 15 minutes minimum drying time
* Do NOT wash hair, swim, or sweat heavily for 4 hours minimum

**Finasteride Dosing:**

* Take 1mg oral finasteride at same time daily
* Consistency maintains stable blood levels
* Can be taken with or without food
* Morning dosing helps with routine adherence

**Key Morning Principles:**

* Complete drying before styling or covering scalp
* Avoid heat styling immediately after application
* Schedule workouts for afternoon/evening to avoid sweat interference
* No hats or beanies for at least 2-3 hours

**THE OPTIMAL EVENING ROUTINE:**

**7:00 PM (12 hours after morning dose):**

**Second Minoxidil Application:**

* Apply exactly 12 hours after morning dose for consistent coverage
* Same 1mL dosage and application technique
* Allow full drying time before bed (minimum 4 hours ideal)

**Scalp Massage (Optional but Beneficial):**

* 5 minutes of gentle circular motions with fingertips
* Increases blood flow to scalp
* May enhance treatment absorption
* Do AFTER minoxidil has dried slightly (3-5 minutes post-application)

**Evening Considerations:**

* Apply early enough that it's fully dry before bed
* Wet minoxidil on pillow = wasted product and potential skin irritation
* Use same systematic approach as morning

**WEEKLY PROTOCOL ADDITIONS:**

**Microneedling (Once Weekly):**

**Recommended Schedule: Sunday Evening**

**Proper Technique:**

* Skip that evening's minoxidil application
* Cleanse scalp thoroughly beforehand
* Disinfect device (1.5mm dermaroller or dermastamp) in 70% isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes
* Application pattern for affected areas:
   * Vertical passes: 5 times
   * Horizontal passes: 5 times
   * Diagonal passes: 5 times each direction
* Use moderate pressure (redness without bleeding)
* Disinfect device after use
* Apply soothing aloe vera gel if needed
* Wait full 24 hours before resuming minoxidil (prevents systemic absorption)

**Why 1.5mm Depth Matters:**

* Shallower depths (0.5-1.0mm) insufficient for hair loss
* 1.5mm reaches dermis where follicles reside
* Creates controlled micro-injuries that trigger healing response
* Studies show 3-4x increased minoxidil absorption

**Ketoconazole Shampoo (2-3x Weekly):**

**Recommended Schedule: Monday, Wednesday, Saturday Mornings**

**Critical Application Rules:**

* Apply 1-2% ketoconazole shampoo to wet scalp
* Massage thoroughly into scalp (not just hair)
* **Leave on for FULL 10 minutes** (most common mistake is quick rinsing)
* Set timer - 10 minutes is longer than it feels
* Contact time is essential for anti-androgenic effects
* Rinse thoroughly
* Wait 20-30 minutes before minoxidil application

**Why Contact Time Matters:**

* Ketoconazole needs time to penetrate scalp
* Anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory benefits require adequate exposure
* Quick rinsing provides minimal therapeutic effect

**CONSISTENCY SYSTEMS THAT WORK:**

**Phone Alarms (Essential):**

* Morning minoxidil: Daily alarm at chosen time
* Evening minoxidil: Daily alarm 12 hours later
* Microneedling: Weekly reminder
* Ketoconazole: Specific days marked

**Medication Tracking Apps:**

* Medisafe, MyTherapy, or similar apps
* Track adherence streaks
* Sends notifications for missed doses
* Gamification increases motivation
* Provides documentation for dermatologist visits

**Visual Organization:**

* Dedicate specific bathroom location for all products
* Keep dermaroller in visible alcohol container
* Group treatments together
* Visible placement = less likely to forget

**Progress Documentation:**

* Monthly photos: Same lighting, angle, time of day
* Multiple views: Front, both temples, crown
* Natural lighting preferred (near window, morning)
* Store in dedicated photo album
* Compare every 3 months (not daily or weekly)

**COMMON MISTAKES THAT DELAY RESULTS:**

**Application Errors:**

1. **Wet scalp application** \- Dilutes minoxidil, reduces absorption, product runs off
2. **Inconsistent timing** \- Disrupts steady-state blood levels
3. **Insufficient drying time** \- Product rubs off, doesn't absorb
4. **Wrong application site** \- Applying to hair instead of scalp
5. **Excessive rubbing** \- Can irritate scalp without improving absorption

**Timing Errors:**

1. **Washing hair too soon** \- Need minimum 4 hours for full absorption
2. **Exercising too soon after application** \- Sweat dilutes and removes product
3. **Variable application times** \- Body responds better to consistent schedule
4. **Skipping doses** \- Even 75% adherence significantly reduces effectiveness

**Technique Errors:**

1. **Inadequate ketoconazole contact time** \- Rushing the 10 minutes
2. **Skipping microneedling** \- Missing 3-4x absorption enhancement
3. **Microneedling too frequently** \- More than weekly causes chronic inflammation
4. **Applying minoxidil within 24 hours of needling** \- Risk of systemic absorption

**Progress Tracking Errors:**

1. **No baseline photos** \- Can't objectively assess improvement
2. **Daily mirror checking** \- Creates anxiety, can't see gradual changes
3. **Inconsistent photo conditions** \- Different lighting makes comparison impossible
4. **Assessing too early** \- Need minimum 3-6 months for visible changes

**REALISTIC TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS:**

**Month 1-2:**

* Possible increased shedding (normal - indicates follicle cycling)
* No visible improvements yet
* Focus on establishing routine consistency

**Month 3-4:**

* Shedding typically stops
* Hair loss may slow or halt
* Still minimal visible regrowth for most

**Month 5-6:**

* First visible changes for early responders
* Vellus hairs may appear in affected areas
* Density may begin improving slightly

**Month 7-12:**

* Progressive improvements continue
* Vellus hairs transitioning to terminal hairs
* Noticeable density improvements for responders

**Month 12-24:**

* Peak results typically occur
* Maintenance becomes the focus
* Continued modest improvements possible

**TREATMENT COSTS (Monthly):**

**Budget Protocol:**

* Generic finasteride 1mg: $5-15 (GoodRx, Costco)
* Minoxidil 5% (generic): $12-20 (Costco, Amazon)
* Ketoconazole 2% shampoo: $5-8 (lasts 2-3 months)
* Dermaroller 1.5mm: $5 (replace every 3 months)
* **Total: $30-45/month**

**Name Brand Protocol:**

* Brand finasteride (Propecia): $70-90
* Brand minoxidil (Rogaine): $40-50
* Nizoral brand: $15
* **Total: $130-155/month**

**OPTIMIZATION TIPS:**

**For Maximum Adherence:**

* Anchor routine to existing habits (after brushing teeth, with coffee)
* Prep everything the night before
* Keep backup products so you never run out
* Set up automatic refills/reorders

**For Maximum Effectiveness:**

* Never skip doses to ""make up for it later""
* Maintain strict 12-hour intervals when possible
* Document your routine in notes app initially
* After 2-3 weeks it becomes automatic

**For Stress Reduction:**

* Take photos monthly (not weekly)
* Avoid comparing to others online
* Remember maintenance = success
* Trust the process during shedding phase

**WHEN TO ADJUST ROUTINE:**

**Assess at 6 Months:**

* If maintaining or improving: Continue exact protocol
* If still rapidly declining: Consult dermatologist about escalation
* If experiencing side effects: Discuss modifications

**Don't Change Before 6 Months:**

* Takes time to see results
* Changing variables makes assessment impossible
* Patience is critical to success

**THE BOTTOM LINE:**

Success with hair loss treatments requires:

1. **Proper technique** \- Correct application to dry scalp, adequate contact time
2. **Consistent timing** \- Same schedule daily, 12-hour minoxidil intervals
3. **Patient adherence** \- Minimum 6 months before assessment
4. **Realistic expectations** \- Maintenance is success, regrowth is bonus
5. **Proper tracking** \- Monthly photos, not daily mirror anxiety

1onao2j,https://i.redd.it/7i8qftyze1zf1.jpeg,Sex Review: Dantsu Flame,"Hello everybody! I'm the new reviewer,  ready to make debut. For this review, I'll be in the ring of fire with Dantsu Flame, so try not to get too hot.

**Body Type:** While not the largest all-around, Dantsu Flame is a fair bit bustier than her eccentric friend group of Tachyon, Pokke, and Cafe. With a chest size of 90cm, she's equal to the likes of Daiwa Scarlet and Air Groove, along with beautifully wide hips that sit comfortably at 88cm. Also standing above her peers, she's a comfortable 163cm tall.

**Personality:** ""He-hello? Is anybody there?""

Dantsu came to my office much earlier than I had anticipated she would, slightly hunched as she crossed the door's threshold. As she sat across from me, I could tell that she seemed nervous, fingers trembling slightly. After I calmed her down, she spoke up, voice slightly softer than before. 

""S-so, you're going to be my reviewer? That makes me glad.""

I could tell from the get-go that Dantsu isn't the type with much of a Flame beneath her, but still, she insisted that she wanted to do this, no matter how much her voice caught in her throat or how much her ears flicked about from the nerve.

""Tachyon and Cafe have been reviewed already, a-and I didn't wanna be left behind again...""

So, we both made our way to the bedroom, with her subtly guiding me with a soft hand. 

**Preferred Role/Position:** It was immediately and abundantly clear that Dantsu was one to please, as once we were unclothed, she was already on her knees, cheek pressed against my thigh while gazing at my form.

Despite her earlier nervousness, however, it all burned away as she opened her mouth and began working herself down my length like it was nothing. As she bobbed her head with almost professional levels of control, she kept eye contact, while I neared orgasm faster than I thought possible. In the end, it only took around a minute for me to finish once, down her throat. *This is going to be a bit harder than I thought.*

After leaving me breathless, she crawled into bed beside me and laid back on the sheets, inviting me softly with a wag of her finger. As I got close, I could see her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes gleamed like a dancing fire as her breaths drew short. 

""I-I'm ready when you are...""

When we started for real, it became clear that she was a service bottom, letting me do whatever I pleased, however I pleased to do it. Her body seemingly molded to me in an instant, not unlike a flame in an enclosed space. However, the positions that made her moan the loudest and climax the fastest were the ones that allowed her to keep eye contact with me (Missionary, Mating Press, Cowgirl, etc.). These orgasms came even faster whenever I smoothed my hands over her soft skin, especially around her breasts. As we went further on, things became even more passionate and she slowly became bolder, even pulling me in for kisses while feeling on my back.

 Another weakness was praise, which made the poor girl choke up in tears, but also made her smile brightly between moans. Perhaps it was because this is my first time, or because of how much Dantsu's Flames fed our burning desire, but we ended up going all night, only coming to a stop at around 2:30 AM, though I feel that we could've gone even longer. I came five times, while Dantsu had a whopping eleven orgasms.

**Post-Intercourse/Afterglow:** Cuddly doesn't even begin to describe her. She clung tightly to me all night, dried tears staining her cheeks as her tail drooped over me. We slept until late morning, and when I woke up, she was gone from the bed.

Thinking she was gone, I stumbled into my dining room, groggy from the extensive session last night. What I found, however, was already-brewed coffee, and Dantsu sitting at the table, eating a sandwich... With a full carrot in the middle. Not even cut, just a full, clean carrot, in the dead center of the bread. *Yeah. Toootally normal.*

""Good morning, Sir! I brewed some coffee for you, and there's some toast in the toaster.""

It seems like the timid girl from yesterday was gone, and now she seemed much more boisterous. She hadn't even put her clothes back on, and she was acting like this was a second home. After I made my coffee, grabbed the toast she made for me, and sat across from her, she started intently at me, eyes shining hazel.

""So, did I shine last night?""

All I could give to her was a nod, and she nearly jumped with joy before composing herself. After that, I helped her gather her clothes, and as she headed out thtough the door, she gave me a light peck on the cheek.

**Final Verdict: 10.5/10.** Now, this may be a bit biased, given this was my first time reviewing, but Dantsu Flame was all-around perfect in my eyes. Her body was mesmerizing, eyes even more so. She moved in a graceful cascade for the entire night of our coupling, and as we reached a fever pitch, her true passion soared along with her howls of pleasure.

The aftercare was also exquisite, staying close and vulnerable as we had drifted off to sleep. That's not even to mention how thoughtful she was in the morning, even if she *did* raid my pantry. The final kiss before she left had sealed it for me, even scoring her an extra half-point. Excellent bedroom knowledge and soft, yet loving aftercare and second-nature etiquette culminated in the perfect storm that was Dantsu Flame. I may, in fact, find myself going for seconds in the foreseeable future.

Next time, I'll be having a heated one-on-one with the American queen, rival of Narita Brian, Amazonian warrior, Hishi Amazon! Now, I'll be signing off.

He keeps acting entitled af to my stuff. and keeps making loose talk. Cant mind his own fucking business and passes comments over every single thing im doing. and likes to feed ego to his own fucking half knowledged ass by belittling me. It all started when he was 2 and i was 8. he used snatch all my fucking stuff even the gifts i received and refused to give it back and even breaked it. And the worst part my parents allowed it and told me to sit tf down while he tore my most cherished stuff apart and always fed (still feeds) on the satisfaction of seeing me getting scolded by my parents because of him. Now hes 10 yes i know still a fucking child. My parents refuse to parents him, now hes an asshole with a big A. My parents dont see the stuff he does to me but scold me when I react accordingly. When I was his age my parents started to homeschooling me and my mom used that as an excuse to use me as her fucking maid i obviously hated it and nobody believed me and child protection laws are non existent in my country. But my brother is always screaming and throwing tantrums and doesn't do a single fucking thing around the house even if I ask him to help me. He has learned some seriouly disrespectful stuff and keeps saying that to me. Even infront of my parents and they dissmiss it and act all ingnorant and somtimes like I dont even exist then tell me im being fussy and making a big deal out of nothing when he says stuff that should never be said to a human being let alone your own fucking sister. When i react they scold me and say that I should not be reacting and they're the one's who should and I have to go tell them first. But, dont even react accordingly when I do. He said some stuff to me that im super ashamed to share that here. The first time he said it infront of my dad for which my dad just have him a side eye. I made sure to let them know i was hurt for which they rolled their eyes and my mom made him give me multiple false apologies because I refused to take him out and buy him the stuff he wanted very badly. Now 2 days ago was the second time he said horrible and disgusting stuff to me again. I was dancing in front of a big mirror in my dad's room to check if my posture was right. He came me and I asked him to join me. At first he started dancing silly and showed me moved he remembered from the video game just dance and asked me to guess it. And a minute later out of nowhere he said those stuff to me. I was shocked and disturbed that i couldn't react for a minute. Then I started screaming at him, and scolded him, and told him to fall at my feet and apologise. but, he didn't even understand what his wrongdoing was. Then I went to my mom and, when she heard what he said she softly asked him ""hey? What the hell?"" And then screamed at me and shooed me away like i was some disgusting rabid street dog. I am so hurt that im refusing to interact or speak with him. But my family is acting like im a crazy bitch and overreacting and refused to acknowledge my feelings like always. Im making sure my little brother knows i fucking hate his existence but, hes constantly trying to seek my attention but not in a good way. 40 minutes ago I was minding own business and doing just dance and he was playing with my old heavy roller skates that doesn't fit me anymore. At first he came in the middle of my screen to disturb me and I ignored it even though it caused me to miss a step and loose a star. Now that he saw that I didn't react he came behind me and took out the skates from under the sofa and hit my legs to trip me and gave me a sinister smile and acted like ot was an accident and he was just taking them to the other side so I dont trip on them. Thankfully I didn't trip but it hurt my toes and now I might lose a nail. No matter how much i tried to control myself, My anger flared and I tried to kick his fucking legs but he hit my feet again and ran away to the kitchen. My grandma whos the only person in the house right now started screaming at my and threatened to splash me with the hot coffee in her hands and angrily asked me if she wasnt there to deal with him?. Then she continued to not say anything to him when i was standing there waiting for her to deal with him and then she labelled it as an ""accident"" when she didn't even fucking see it happen. I tried to control my self again but i couldn't anymore so I went at him and hit his head but not hard even tho I should've. Then I went to the kitchen to try to tell her in detail/ explain what he did but she refused to hear me out and still stood up for him told me im overreacting and tried to convince me that i couldve been an ""accident"". Hurt, I didn't let her finish and ran up to my room. I know my dad will scold me for hitting him or may even hit me and my mom will maybe do the same and drag it on for hours continuing to back him. I hate his existence. I hate my parents for a lot of things including enabling him to be like that. And i hate seeing him growing up to be a weaponized incompetence and a possible future offender.",1,1762173606.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

This dude comes up to our table to ask us (me) to quiet down bc he is studying. I get asked to be quiet a lot and it's always embarrassing. My husband said No I don't think so. This isn't a study hall. This empowered me, instead of retreating I suggested maybe he go to a library. After he walked away, I noticed he didn't even have head on.

I am constantly being asked to change my behavior to make other people comfortable. I'm too loud, I talk too much or too inappropriately, I fidget too much, etc. and I'm so tired of being asked to be existing differently.

If you already know, this post isn’t for you. Go tweak your prompt or grab a coffee ☕.  
If not, stick around: in ten minutes you’ll have a Mistral model running on your own computer.

>⚠️ **Quick note:**  
This is a **getting-started guide**, meant to help you run local models **in under 10 minutes**.  
LM Studio has many advanced features (local API, embeddings, tool use, etc.)  
The goal here is simply to **get you started and running smoothly.** 😉

# 🧠 What Is a Local Model and Why Use One?

Simple: while **Le Chat**, **ChatGPT**, or **Gemini** run their models in the cloud, a **local model** runs **directly on your machine**.  
The main benefit is **privacy. Y**our data never leaves your computer, so you keep control over what’s processed and stored.

That said, don’t be fooled by the hype.  
When certain tech blogs claim you can “Build your own Le Chat / ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude at home,” they’re being, let’s put it kindly, **very optimistic** 😏

Could you do it? Kind of, but you’d need infrastructure few people have in their living rooms.  
At the **business level** it’s a different story, but for personal use or testing you can **get surprisingly close**, enough to have a practical substitute or a task-specific assistant that works entirely offline.

# 🚀 Before we start

This is the **first in a short tutorial series**.  
Each one will be **self-contained**, no cliffhangers, no “to be continued…” nonsense.

We’re starting with **LM Studio** because it’s the **easiest and fastest** way to get a local model running, and later tutorials will **dig deeper into its hidden features**, which are surprisingly powerful once you know where to look.

So, without further ado… **let’s jump into it.**

# 🪜 Step 1: Install LM Studio

1️⃣ Go to [**https://lmstudio.ai**](https://lmstudio.ai)  
2️⃣ Click **Download** (top-right) or the big purple button in the middle.  
3️⃣ Run the installer.  
4️⃣ On first open, select User and Skip (Top Right Corner).

>🧩 *Note:* LM Studio is available for **Mac (Intel / M series)**, **Windows**, and **Linux**. On Apple Silicon it automatically uses Metal acceleration, so performance is excellent.

# ⚙️ Step 2: Enable Power User Mode

To **download models directly** from the app, you’ll need to **switch to Power User** mode.

1️⃣ Look at the bottom-left corner of the window (next to the LM Studio version).  
2️⃣ You’ll see three options: **User**, **Power User**, and **Developer**.  
3️⃣ Click **Power User**.

This unlocks the **Models** tab and the download options.

**Developer** works too, but avoid it unless you really know what you’re doing, you could tweak internal settings by mistake.

>💡 Tip: Power User mode gives you full access without breaking anything. It’s the perfect middle ground between simplicity and control.

# 🔍 Step 3: Download a Mistral model (GGUF / MLX)

1️⃣ Click the **magnifying glass icon** (🔍) on the left sidebar.  
→ This opens the **Model Search** window (*Mission Control*).

2️⃣ Type **mistral** in the search bar.  
→ You’ll see all available Mistral-based models (*Magistral*, *Devstral*, etc.).

❓ **GGUF vs MLX**  
We’ll skip deep details here (ask in the comments if you want a separate post).

* 💻 On **Windows / Linux**, select **GGUF**.
* 🍎 On **Mac**, select **both GGUF and MLX**.
   * If an **MLX** version exists, use it: it’s **optimized for Apple Silicon** and offers **significant performance gains**.

3️⃣ Under **Download Options**, you’ll see **quantizations** and their **file sizes**.

* ⚙️ Avoid anything below **Q4\_K\_M,** quality drops fast.
* 💾 Pick a model that uses **less than half of your VRAM** (PC) or **unified memory** (Mac).
* Ideally, aim for **¼ of total memory** for smoother performance.

4️⃣ Once downloaded, click **Use in New Chat**.  
→ The model loads into a new chat session and you’re ready to go.  
  
**💡🧩 Why You Should Leave Free Memory (VRAM / Unified Memory)**

>**Simple explanation:**  
The **model weights** aren’t the only thing that uses memory.  
When the model generates text, it builds a **KV-cache**, a temporary memory that stores the ongoing conversation.  
The longer the history, the bigger the cache… and the more memory it eats.

>So yes, you *can* technically load a 20 GB model on a system with 24 GB, but you’re **cutting it dangerously close**.  
As soon as the context grows, performance tanks or the app crashes.

>➡️ **Rule of thumb:** keep at **least** **around 50 % of your memory free**.  
If you don’t need long-context conversations, you can go lower —but don’t max out your RAM or VRAM just because it “seems to work”.

# ⚙️ Step 4: Configure the model before loading

After clicking **Use in New Chat**, you’ll see a setup window with model options.  
Check **Show Advanced Settings** to reveal all parameters.

https://preview.redd.it/w82q6qavb1zf1.png?width=1390&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b752e1213f71b5826710b53cc32102d3796bf46

**🧠 Context Length**

As shown in the image, you’ll see both the **current context** (default: 4096 tokens) and the **maximum supported** (here, *Magistral Small* supports **131,072 tokens**).  
You can adjust it, but remember:  
➡️ More tokens remembered = **more memory needed** and **slower generation**.

**🧩 KV Cache Quantization**

An **experimental** feature.  
If your model supports it, you don’t need to set context length manually —the system uses the model’s full context but **quantized (compressed)**.  
That reduces memory use and allows a larger history, **at the cost of some precision**.

>💡 *Tip:* Higher bit depth = less quality loss.

**🎲 Seed**

Controls **variation between responses**.  
Leave it **unchecked** to allow re-generations with more variety.

**💾 Remember Settings**

When enabled, LM Studio **remembers your current settings** for that specific model.  
Once ready, click **Load Model** and you’re good to go.

# 💬 Step 5: Create a New Chat and Add a System Prompt

Once the model is loaded, you’re ready to **start chatting**.

1️⃣ Create a new chat using the purple **“Create a New Chat (⌘N)”** button or the **+** icon at the top left.

https://preview.redd.it/tw7nwvlyc1zf1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3d73cee3f2dbf9e589f4d470ff04277518b367

2️⃣ The new chat will appear in the sidebar.  
You can **rename**, **duplicate**, **delete**, or even **reveal it in Finder/File Explorer** (handy for saving or sharing sessions).

https://preview.redd.it/byylo2v2d1zf1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=c16446845cee88150f66059f6837c336e5d0b6ec

3️⃣ At the top of the chat window, you’ll see a tab wit tree points (…) press them an select **Edit** **System Prompt**.

https://preview.redd.it/0q611cild1zf1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f9e36ef2218418ca10cecbdf3068a9c4e5c5cb

This is where you can enter **custom instructions** for the model’s behavior in that chat.

It’s the easiest way to create a **simple custom agent** for your project or workflow.

https://preview.redd.it/y04zlpxpd1zf1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=e625286e9bf55ac192ecf001ebcd900c7a99c5f2

And that’s it. You’ve got **LM Studio running locally**.  
Experiment, play, and don’t worry about breaking things: worst case, just reinstall 😅

If you have questions or want to share your setup, drop it in the comments.  
See you on Next Chapter.

I use it to carry my favorite beer on trips and hot coffee to the office, and I really like it. Its modern design and useful features have made it part of my everyday routine.

**Pros:**

* I can keep my beer cold for hours with the insulation in this growler.
* The growler keeps my coffee hot for a long time, which is great for my morning commute.
* The leakproof steel lined lid is super convenient and prevents spills.
* The easy-to-carry handle makes it perfect for taking to outdoor events or on hikes.
* The stainless steel material is durable and easy to clean.

**Cons:**

* The price is a bit higher than other growlers on the market.
* The lid can be a bit tricky to clean if you don't do it regularly.
* The growler is not dishwasher safe, which can be inconvenient.

It's the best one I’ve used so far, and I truly recommend it to anyone who wants a strong and modern way to carry their drinks. The good points easily outweigh the few downsides, and I’m glad to have it as part of my everyday use. This post includes Amazon affiliate links.

1onalm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1onalm9/ethan_the_hired_groom/,Ethan The hired groom,"Ethan, a 17-year-old boy with skin as pale as the moon, messy red hair falling over his crystal-cold blue eyes, always dressed in his worn black jacket and dark pants that made him look like a walking shadow. His life was pure hell. His father was a violent alcoholic, a burly man who came staggering home from the factory, with bloodshot eyes and fists ready to strike. Many nights, Ethan and his mother ended up curled in a corner, feeling the burn of the blows and the echo of insults that resonated like thunder in the empty house.

His mother... poor woman. Years of abuse had driven her mad, with episodes where she lost control and scratched Ethan, screaming horrible things while tears ran down her face. But then she would repent, hugging him while sobbing and asking for forgiveness. Ethan loved her anyway; she was his only light in that darkness. At school, things didn't get better: bullies humiliated him for being poor, pushed him against cold metal lockers, laughing at his old clothes and that he never had money for anything. The family barely survived; the little money his mother earned as a waitress went to his father's alcohol, and now she was getting sicker and sicker, with a mental breakdown that was becoming physical, coughing up blood and needing expensive treatment that never came. Ethan felt trapped, as if invisible hands were slowly strangling him every day.

One night, unable to sleep with his heart beating like a war drum, Ethan opened his broken laptop in his freezing room. The blue glow of the screen was the only thing cutting through the dimness. Desperate to find a way out, he dove into the Deep Web, that hidden labyrinth of the internet where normal people don't enter. He navigated through forbidden forums, with black backgrounds and red texts blinking like evil eyes. There, on a site called ""Shadow Escorts,"" he found people who offered him work. It was nothing good: they hired him to assassinate, but disguised as something innocent. Ethan was handsome, with that red hair and blue eyes that attracted girls from afar, despite the bullying. They would pay him to act as a ""rental boyfriend"" for just 24 hours... and then, eliminate the victim. He hesitated a lot, feeling a coldness creeping up his spine, but when he saw his mother collapse again on the kitchen floor, gasping and spitting blood, he accepted. The money was too good to refuse.

His first mission was terrifying. He was hired for a rich girl from the neighboring town. Ethan met her in a dark park, under streetlights that buzzed like dying insects. They spent the 24 hours pretending: walks through rainy streets where water splashed like cold tears, forced laughter in cafes smelling of burnt coffee, stolen kisses that tasted like betrayal. She quickly fell in love with his fake charm, not knowing it was a trap. When time was up, at midnight, Ethan took her to a deserted alley. His heart hammered in his chest, sweat prickled his skin. He took out a knife hidden in his black jacket, and with a quick, silent movement, he cut her throat. The gurgling of blood on the wet pavement still haunts him in nightmares. He left her there, disappearing into the shadows. Days later, police found the mutilated body, but Ethan already had the money in his anonymous account. There was no trace connecting him.

And so more assignments began. Each time, the same thing: girls who ""bought"" him for 24 hours, falling in love with his mysterious appearance. Ethan seduced them with cold smiles, took them to isolated places at the end of the time... and killed them. Some with the knife, feeling the warmth of blood on his hands; others strangled, hearing their last choked gasps in the darkness. The bodies appeared mutilated or simply disappeared in black rivers or dense forests where crows cawed like demonic laughter. With the money, he bought medicine for his mother, food for the house, a little hope in the midst of horror. But his father discovered it. One night, drunk as always, he burst into Ethan's room with eyes red with fury, demanding the money while waving a broken bottle that shone like a weapon in the dim light. The fight was savage: blows that sounded like bones breaking, furniture overturned with a crash. Ethan, cornered and filled with accumulated rage, grabbed a kitchen knife. He plunged it into his father's chest again and again, feeling the flesh give way and warm blood splatter his face. The man fell to the floor gurgling, his glassy eyes fixing on Ethan one last time. He dragged him to the basement and buried him under the cold dirt floor, where the smell of rot mixed with that of death.

For a while, things improved. Ethan's mother recovered a bit with the treatment, but the illness was too strong. She died in her bed one dawn, her fragile body pale as a ghost, leaving Ethan alone in that house that now smelled of death everywhere. Desperation consumed him like a black fire: he realized that life in the Deep Web was a pit of monsters, rich and sick people who played with lives as if they were nothing. Rage blinded him. He tracked down his main boss through encrypted chats, an anonymous voice that became a real man in a luxurious penthouse in the city, surrounded by luxury that stank of corruption.

Ethan broke in one stormy night, with a stolen gun tucked in his black jacket, the cold metal pressing against his skin like a reminder of his new reality. He climbed the emergency stairs, hearing his own ragged breathing and thunder rumbling outside. He found the boss in his office, a fat guy with an arrogant smile. Ethan didn't hesitate: he took out the gun and fired. The blast was deafening, like a scream in the void; the bullet entered the man's chest, splattering blood on the white marble walls. He fell to the floor writhing, and Ethan gave him the coup de grâce in the head, the echo resonating like an inevitable end.

Since then, Ethan disappeared into the shadows, becoming an independent hitman. They say he's still out there, a ghost with messy red hair and icy blue eyes, dressed in black and armed with his gun. Reports of missing people rise wherever he goes, girls found dead in alleys with their throats cut or bodies hidden in forgotten places. And if you hear a soft knock on your door at midnight, with the wind whispering your name... don't open. Because Ethan once whispered to a victim he let live by mistake: ""In the end, we all hire our own demons... and mine always arrive on time, with the knife ready and the gun loaded.""

It was quite shock for me as I was not aware of inattentive form and had completely different view of ADHD, based probably on what could see in TV etc... Anyway, for more then 15 years I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and tried probably almost all available antidepressants without any success, so when lately therapist suggested to check if I have ADHD and was diagnosed I had really big hopes that finally I found the problem and something finally will help me...
Unfortunately it is not looking this way so far, I'm finishing 2nd month of of titration with MyPace, currently I'm on 70mg of Elvanse for 2 weeks. The issue is that I can't feel any improvements and really I don't have any side effects as well, just lower appetite. At the beginning of titration I have feeling that on some days I can feel positive effect of Elvanse  but I'm afraid it could be some honeymoon effect, I had similar with new antidepressants. 
Now, when I realised that Elvanse is not helping much, I'm feeling much worse with no hope for improvement, impostor syndrome, and general hopeless... I did my best to help Elvanse works, take it always with proteins, stopped drinking coffee, I'm not drinking alcohol and trying to stay hydrated. 
Is there anyone with similar situation who found something helping and give some hope? 
I will probably ask for change of medication to try something else but my enthusiasm is very low and it makes me feel even worse as I'm afraid meds won't work when I have such a bad attitude and mood... 
I will grateful for any suggestions or good word, I'm tired of looking for help and improvement for many years and without success. 
Sorry for very long post I was trying to write it for long time and it grow in my head. 
Just last remark - I'm currently generally in quite shitty place with my old dog sick, who was amazing support for me for many years, struggle at work and financial issues etc; I suppose that it can impact how meds are working as well...

Our itinerary is roughly this: 
Fly into Liberia:
Day 1-4: La Fortuna / Arenal Volcano
Day 5-7: Monteverde Cloud Forest
Day 8-9: Río Celeste / Tenorio Volcano National Park
Day 10-14: Playa Samara or Playa Conchal (Guanacaste Coast)
Fly out of Liberia.

Hoping to see a lot of nature, waterfalls, hot springs. We love hiking and staying active! We also love our coffee, so would be very cool to do a coffee tour. 

Please give me your recommendations and must sees!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1onagmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1onagmh/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_1/,There’s Something Under the Boardwalk - [Part 1],"If you're reading this, it's because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It's only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it's hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We're barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it's already a ghost town. That's where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

""Spectre's: Records & Rarities""; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn't be able to name a single song off the album they're donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I'd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I'm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight's choice: ""Secret Treaties"" by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" — who doesn't? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. I retired the familiar sounds of ELO off the turntable and introduced it to something new. 

Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70's. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ""Career of Evil"" blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn't have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ""Harvester of Eyes"" certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn't care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn't have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn't nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody's grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it's so full of life that it's overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that's why I never left. If I don't visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn't want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent's Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

""Oh my god! You scared me!"" she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ""I'm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.""

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

""Sure, sure. Three bucks.""

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ""So, any plans tonight?""

I thought about it, and I really didn't have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick's for a drink or two until I've had enough to put me to sleep.

""I was going to head over to Mick's, maybe catch the game for a bit.""

She grinned. ""I know Mick's — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I'll stop by. There isn't much else to do on a night like tonight.""

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

""Maybe I'll see you there,"" I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

""Hey bud, I haven't seen you in a while.""

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ""Hey Mac, long time.""

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ""It's been dead out here, huh?""

Without looking up, he lamented, ""Sure has. It's that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.""

Puzzled, I pressed him. ""What do you mean?""

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ""I need to get some help. I'm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.""

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn't have been happier.

""That's great, man! I'd give you a ride myself if I had a car.""

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ""I just need to see her again.""

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

""I haven't really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and... everything just started falling apart..."" he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ""I'm just ready. Tonight's my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.""

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn't know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ""Vincent's was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I'll see you, I won't take no for an answer.""

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

""That's really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.""

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ""I really think what you're doing is great. It's been nice knowing you.""

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ""You too. I'd say I'll see you again, but I really hope it's not here.""

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

""Hey, what's your real name, by the way? Maybe I'll look you up someday to see how you're doing.""

Without turning fully around, he said, ""It doesn't really matter.""

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick's resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick's served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick's was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick's was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp's nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn't a wasp's nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was... breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn't very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn't help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1onaebc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadhausSonata/comments/1onaebc/here_is_the_meaning_of_life/,here is the meaning of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Last weekend I got tired of watching my own team get stuck in decision paralysis - endless threads, meetings that went nowhere, and the same “let’s revisit this next week” cycle.

So I locked myself in with caffeine and built **Decision Maker**, a web app that helps groups make decisions *without bias or chaos*.

Here’s how it works:

* You create a decision question
* Invite teammates via email (no signup needed)
* Everyone answers anonymously
* AI analyzes the reasoning and finds patterns + consensus
* You get a clear, unbiased report in \~48 hours

People tend to be surprisingly honest when they’re anonymous — and that makes the insights a lot more balanced.

Built with: **FastAPI, React, Temporal workflows, AWS Bedrock**, and an unhealthy amount of coffee ☕

It’s live here: [https://decision-maker.ai]()

Anyway, I finally meet this friend by inviting her to a party. She made no effort with me at all. When I tried to make an effort to connect one on one by going downstairs together where my boyfriend was she said no and that she’d stay upstairs with my friends friends who were being really off putting, hence my suggesting we go down where my bf was together. When my boyfriend suggested we go up to check on her she only made eye contact and spoke to him, she’d obviously been making an impression on the guys as she was now wearing one of their jackets. 

Throughout the party (my friends party btw) her and my bf were attached at the hip and binge drank together all night. Even though my partner does not have much money he bought her a couple of cocktails - I earn more and when we are out he and I usually go 50/50. I wasn’t drinking as I was recovering from a bad cold. 

Towards the end of the night everyone was leaving but they still had full drinks, she had gone to the bathroom and I suggested to my boyfriend that he, her, one other friend of mine and I stay so they could finish their drinks. When she returned and saw we were waiting on them she abruptly got up and ushered to leave. They were both already at the bottom of the stairs toward the exit before my friend had time to come out from the booth side. I mean it’s no big deal I just thought it was kinda rude to take off and not all leave together or wait for my friend to get out from the booth.  

So when my bf initially brought up how I went with the girl, he was drunk so I said “oh we didn’t get much one on one time but there will be other parties” to find a better time to talk about my discomfort. 

Their entire dynamic felt off to me, and although my boyfriend did make an effort to check in with me, she kept giving me nothing so I just stayed with the crew outside the venue. I spoke to my boyfriend about it and their past and he accused me of being jealous even though I had explicit examples of her not really giving me anything or making any effort. I feel like she doesn’t respect me or our relationship.

There is a calm moment on Monday mornings where I can drink a cup of coffee before the day and week come rushing at me. I'll sit in my garden and scroll a bit on my phone, and inevitably feel the pull to have a friend to chat with. I'm a parent, so socializing has become an unusual endeavor outside of meeting parents for kid related activities, with whom I have nothing in common apart from school and parenting. Maybe they'll have a bit of interest in gardening, or share a family recipe they cooked, but after a few polite words the conversation ends and each moves on with their lives. I'll talk to my wife, but it's mostly the day to day planning, house stuff, organizing, and all the adult things we have to do, and then maybe, at the end of the day if we're not too tired, we'll hang out and talk for a bit. Joining discord servers feels like my voice is just a drop in the sea. And sometimes I just want a friend to chat with, silly things like what books we enjoy, send each other pictures of flowers and plants, talk about sci-fi and fantasy or what hobbies we have. Vent to each other, offer a friendly ear or a distraction.

If you are a housewife like me, a parent, an adult feeling a similar way, I would love to hear from you. Tell me something about yourself, or what you love about autumn.",0,1762172166.0,actuallesbianseurope,1,0.5,False

That was us last quarter.

We took on an international client with a product that needed to be localized in **six different languages** each with its own tone, formatting quirks, and cultural nuances. What looked like a straightforward translation task quickly became a full-blown process overhaul.

Here’s what we learned the hard way 👇

**1. International ≠ Simple Localization**  
Each market had unique needs.

* Japanese users preferred formal, detailed explanations.
* Spanish users wanted friendly, conversational tones.
* The German team asked for technical precision over creativity. Trying to maintain brand consistency across all that? A nightmare.

**2. Cultural + Technical Chaos**  
We ran into timezone chaos, regional formatting bugs, and even character encoding issues that broke the UI.  
Our review cycles took twice as long because every region’s feedback loop was different.

**3. The Turning Point**  
Halfway through, we realized our workflow wasn’t built for global collaboration. We had to create:

* A **centralized translation and feedback system**
* **Dedicated regional leads** for approvals
* A **weekly sync** across all time zones (yes, someone always had coffee at 2 a.m.)

**4. The Outcome**  
Once the new structure was in place, delivery times dropped by 30%, and feedback finally became actionable instead of chaotic.

**Takeaway:**  
If you’re planning to go global, don’t just translate your product **translate your process**.",1,1762172091.0,agencysuccess,0,1.0,False
