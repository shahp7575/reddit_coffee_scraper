1p0cyg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1p0cyg2/coffee_is_unnecessarily_bougie_compared_to_tea/,Coffee is unnecessarily bougie compared to Tea,"I've recently decided to level up my coffee game by buying a Bodium Kettle (on sale), a K6 Grinder and Chemex pourover. Before I was using a cheap electric grinder for whole bean coffee I brought at Publix to use with a Aeropress. I wouldn't call myself an expert on coffee but I do enjoy making a good cup of coffee in the morning or Nespresso, I also have a Nepresso machine at home. 

I was watching a video by James Hoffman, I think that's his name and I was like ""This sh*t is so unnecessary to do all this for a cup of coffee"". I mean, I enjoy doing it but I can also just buy some loose leaf tea at my local tea shop, put the kettle on, brew some tea and call it day. All the tools probably cost less than $50 including the tea.

Coffee can be as ridiculously expensive as you want, espresso is even more expensive and you also need a small books worth of knowledge to make the ""perfect"" cup. Again I enjoy some good bean juice but damn, this is worse than Tea. ",1,1763475101.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1p0cuzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1p0cuzi/im_feeling_frustrated_about_socializing_does/,I'm feeling frustrated about socializing does anyone have any advice?,"Hello everyone! I have been having a hard time making friends, and I am wondering if someone can offer some insight. This isn't just with neurotypical people, it is with neurodiverse ADHD and Autism alike. For example, I have been in choir and theatre, surrounded by fellow autistics and could not make a single friend. 

  
I have had problems all of college. I've had some social issues like oversharing or stuff like that, that makes sense why people have felt uncomfortable. However, I have since worked really hard to improve in those areas and in others to become a better friend. I have read every socializing book and video possible. However, I continue to have this pattern with most people where they like me at first, get to know me, and don't like me so much after that. 

I have tried joining clubs I did cheerleading, jazz choir, theatre, dance marathon, and was president of an honor society. However, I always end up on the outs of the group. 

One pattern that has been disappointing is when people hang out with me one on one and then stop talking to me. In the first two years this usually came about from oversharing or not recognizing when it was time to end the conversation. 

  
However, a couple of years ago I went to a movie with a girl in my choir. I thought we had a good time, but the next day she stopped talking to me, looking at me, and then soon the other girls in the choir stopped talking to me too. At the winter concert we were all supposed to wear something red. That girl made every other girl a red ribbon bow to wear, except me. Another girl, that girl's friend, made all the other girls a nice letter except for me. 

  
Recently I was asked to get coffee by a gilr who joined my sorority. I said Yes i'd love to get coffee. We went for coffee and I thought we had a nice time. But then when I followed up the next week and asked her if she wanted to hangout again, she politley declined saying, ""Sure, but i'll need to check my schedule tomorrow"" and never got back to me. Then at the meeting she didn't even look at me or talk to me. I felt horrible.

  
Why can I not make friends with anyone neurotypical or neurodiverse? I have worked really hard to improve, I'm thoughtful, and kind, and people describe me as being nice. ",1,1763474852.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

31 year old male here. Im 5'10 and my starting weight is 267 lbs. I am very fortunate that insurance through my employer will cover zepbound. I have struggled with weight all my life and I have worked extremely hard at the gym with minimal results. My lab work came back mostly good except I have a slightly elevated a1c so my doc said I am prediabetic with mild insulin resistance. 

Meals wise I dont snack much, I currently have a cadence of eating 3 meals per day. I will eat 2 blueberry bagels for breakfast with a coffee and packing a lunch of a bag of chips and a sandwich for work. I usually eat the most during dinner, so for example, I will pan fry some salmon and then boil white rice and eat strawberries with it and then go back for seconds on the rice and I will eat out during the weekends, so Last Saturday I ordered a large pizza from papa johns and I probably could have eaten the whole thing but I only had half of it.

While im on the medication, I am assuming that I will have to drastically change my eating habits because I won't have the same appetite. I am a little bit nervous about the GI side effects. Would you say that you can mitigate that by eating smaller meals? It would make sense that if you eat something greasy on this medication it could cause you to be nauseous.

1p0ctzm,https://i.redd.it/h1bkxynwv02g1.jpeg,The Year I Finally Figured Out Meal Prep (aka how I stopped calling random snacks “lunch”),"
I used to think meal prep was only for people who have their whole life sorted out. You know the folks with matching containers, neat fridges, and the emotional stability to chop 18 vegetables on a Sunday. Meanwhile, I was out here grabbing whatever fit in my bag and pretending it counted as a meal.

Everything changed the morning I overslept, opened my fridge, and found… half an avocado and some sad leftover coffee. That was my “ok wow, this is not sustainable” moment.

Instead of going full Pinterest-level overhaul, I tried something tiny: one high-protein recipe a week. And honestly? That small shift was what finally made meal prep click for me.

Here are the things that made the biggest difference:



Breakfast: the first time I didn’t start my day in chaos

The first win was these little buffalo chicken egg muffins I made on a whim. They were ridiculously easy, super filling, and actually tasted good at 7 a.m. I’d grab two on the way out and suddenly mornings didn’t feel like a disaster.

On cozier days, I made these super simple breakfast quesadillas with eggs, sausage, sweet potatoes, etc. They reheated perfectly and made me feel like someone who had their life together… even if everything else was falling apart.



Lunch: the meals that stopped my afternoon crashes

For lunch, the cottage-cheese baked ziti situation was a game changer. Creamy, comforting, over 30g of protein, and it kept me from hitting that 3 p.m. “I need a nap or I’m going to scream” wall.

And if I knew I had a busy week coming, I’d throw a chicken-and-rice combo into the slow cooker. Zero effort, five days of food. There’s something weirdly comforting about opening your fridge and seeing a stack of meals waiting for you.



Dinner: the part of the day I used to dread

My go-to “I need comfort food but also need to not blow my goals” dinner became a creamy chicken dish that somehow tastes indulgent but actually fits nicely into a high-protein day.

And when I wanted something with more flavor, I’d do these Korean-style chicken bowls lean protein, veggies, lots of bold flavors. It reminded me that healthy food doesn’t have to be sad or plain. Same with the salmon + sweet potato combo I’d rotate in when I needed something light but nourishing.




What I learned without meaning to

Meal prep taught me that food doesn’t have to be another stressful part of the day. You don’t need a color-coded system or a four-hour cooking block. You just need:

one solid chicken recipe

a couple veggies you don’t hate

some smart swaps

and meals that are actually built for real life


Once I had even a few prepped meals in the fridge, my week honestly felt calmer. Like I’d made a tiny promise to take care of myself and actually kept it.



If your fridge looks like mine did that morning (aka “vibes only, no actual food”), consider this your nudge. You don’t need perfection. You just need one recipe you’re willing to try.

Meal prep isn’t about being strict… it’s about making your life easier.

Anyone else hit that turning point where meal prep suddenly clicked for you? What was the recipe or routine that finally made it doable?",1,1763474784.0,airfryer,1,1.0,False

So Nov 10th I quit coffee without any forethought to the implications of that choice…so here I am. The reason I quit was because the day before I had a coffee from a coffee shop around 2pm which kept me up all night until 4:30am. I slept a few hours and I determined never to do that again and never drink coffee again. After 7 days I have no desire to drink it. (I’m 41, been drinking coffee probably 15 years, 1-3 cups a day).

Here’s my experience after going cold turkey. First 5 days were like nothing I’d ever experienced before. 

Symptoms: 1 episode of elevated heart rate, mood swings, anxiety, heart palpitations…and worst of all what seems to be insomnia. I was doing about 3-4 hours of sleep each night. 2 days ago I did 6-7 hours. But last night I got 0 hours of sleep. No headaches through the process.

Got an appointment with my doctor tomorrow afternoon but would really like to set up for a good nights rest tonight.

Going through the sub I found a lot of folks talking about electrolytes and electrolyte deficiency. My wife picked up some Gatorade which I feel does help with heart palpitations (I think). 

Perhaps I need a better, less sugary electrolyte drink?

Any tips for dealing with the sleep deprivation would be helpful.

Did I make a mistake by quitting cold turkey?

""Sharon Lawrence."" Blade—my father—fixed his eyes on me, a distant, vacant look in them. I knew exactly why: I had my mom's face, almost identical.

""Why didn't she come here herself?""

""Because she's dead, you fu-cking as-shole!"" I choke out, the words practically a scream. 

""None of your business. My mom wrote a letter to you, and I'm here to give it to you. Don't worry, I don't want anything from you, and you can just pretend that I wasn't even here."" I put the letter on the table, then turn on my heels and quickly run out of there.

""Stop. April, stop!"" His yell rang out behind me. ""Kane. Follow her—keep her safe!""

The next second, I crashed hard into a chest as solid as stone. Kane!

He was a lot larger than any other biker I'd seen. He was got a well-groomed beard and a lot of tattoos and muscles. No question, the brute of brutes.

Before I can react, Kane leaned his head down, grabbed my thighs and threw me over his shoulder.

""Aaah! What the he-ll are you doing?"" I scream at him while he walks out of the room. ""Let me go, you fu-cking ape!""

""Listen,"" he said sternly. Then a slap on my as-s.

""Don't try to run. Because me—you can't prank.""

——

""Ever heard of overtraining syndrome?"" the young guy behind the desk at the gym asks when I'm about to run back home. I've been running here and working out for two and a half hours for the third day in a row.

""Ever heard of 'shut the fu-ck up and mind your own fu-cking business' syndrome?"" I snap at him, making him lean back in his chair with his hands in the air.

""Jeez!""

I push the door open, fix my ponytail that's gotten a little loose, then start my 30-minute run home. I don't even want to go home. I hate that house. I'm glad that it's sold, but they're not moving in until next week, and I have to decide where I'm gonna live before leaving.

Isn't that something you do before you decide to sell your home, you think. Well, fu-ck you and mind your own godda-mn business. I've got my reasons for selling it as soon as possible...without having the slightest idea of where I'm gonna live from now on. One thing I know is that I'm not going back to college.

When I'm home, I take a shower, then grab a frozen meal and put it in the microwave. I eat, then continue to pack stuff in boxes. I've donated everything, both small decorations and furniture, to Goodwill. They'll pick everything up tomorrow. All I'm keeping are my clothes. I don't want anything else. I would rather just leave everything like it is than having to pack it away, because it still hurts, but I'm done crying. I would rather be angry and hate the world right now. It's easier than being sad.

I'm up almost all night, packing. I don't get much sleep anyway.

The next day, two guys from Goodwill come with a truck and carry everything inside. I kept a mattress, pillow and cover so I have something to sleep on. When they're done and the house is totally empty, I go for a long run. 

Running and working out is the only thing that keeps me sane. I have all this energy from all the pent-up anger, and if I don't do something to get myself tired, I'm afraid I'll explode. The thing is, I don't seem to get tired no matter how much I run or work out, but it helps...a little.

The day after, I decide that it's time for me to leave. I thought that all the things that held memories in this house were worse to have around, but it turns out that being in this house without them, in an empty shell, is even worse. There's nothing left now and I have no reason to stay here any longer.

I fold down the backseats in my Volvo V70 and put the mattress, pillow and cover there in case I need to sleep in the car for some nights. I already got the money for the house, so I can rent a place, but I need to know where I'm gonna stay first.

I walk up to my bedroom, take my suitcase and the letter that was lying beside my mattress on the floor. I take one last look around, then close the door behind me and drive off. The other letter, I burned after reading it. I just tore off the part with my dad's address on it. That's where I'm going first, to give him his letter.

I thought about burning that one too. Why should I give him a letter from mom when he didn't even want me? That's why mom left all those years ago when she found out that she was pregnant. He didn't want me, and that's why I never asked mom about him. Now, she wants me to give him a letter, and since I don't know where to go, I can at least go there first and drop it off.

The drive from Virginia to Texas takes two days with only a few small breaks. I stop at night to sleep a few hours in my car.

I check my GPS to find this little sh-ithole that I'm going to. It's a tiny town not far from New Mexico, and if I don't find my dad here, I'm sure that someone knows where he is or can give him the letter so I don't have to. It's the kind of town that you can't step your foot into as an outsider without everyone knowing.

I decide to sleep in my car one more night before going to the address that was written in the letter. I park in the far corner of a parking lot outside of a diner. There are a few trees around, and the windows in the back are tinted, so I hope no one will notice me sleeping here.

I walk into the diner to grab some food before bed, or in this case, mattress in the car.

""Hi, what can I get you, darlin'?"" a middle-aged, not so fit man asks me. He seems to be having more body hair peeking out of his shirt than on top of his head. He stands behind the register, chewing gum really loudly with his mouth open. He checks me out, and I feel like puking all over him, let him clean up, then puke all over him again.

""A burger and fries.""

""Want a coke or something with that?""

""Sure,"" I say, looking at the menu on the wall beside the counter, trying to soothe my gag reflex. I really hope that he's not the chef too, but by the looks of his stained, greasy shirt, he is.

While I'm sitting there eating, I hear the rumble of bikes, and I soon see a whole gang of bikers drive by.

Good, they didn't stop.

I loathe bikers from the bottom of my heart. They're not what started my dislike for the whole wide world, but they're the ones that really got me hatin', like they say here in Texas.

I quickly eat up my burger since Chewbacca behind the register is still ogling me.

Perv.

I wonder if it's such a good idea to sleep outside the diner in my car, but I don't want to go further into town yet, and my car is at least a little hidden. It's not like I'm gonna sleep that much anyway.

I walk to my car, open the trunk, crawl in and close and lock it. It's kind of cozy here. I rather sleep in my car than in a run-down motel room. At least it's clean and I've got my own mattress that doesn't have old dried up semen stains on it. I might rent a room just to get a shower once in a while before I know where I'm going and can get something more permanent.

I wake up early the next day, and since I don't want to show myself too much in this town—since I only plan on giving the letter to my dad and drive the he-ll out of here—I guess I have to visit Chewbacca again for breakfast...or at least a coffee to calm my already angry mind.

Even if I'm always up early nowadays, I'm not really a morning person. I need coffee, and preferably a long run or a few hours at the gym to be somewhat of a not so pissed off person. But like I told you, I hardly get tired anymore no matter how much I try. I just still have my morning temper...that now is kind of stuck throughout the whole day.

Luckily, there's no sight of Chewbacca. A kind-looking, middle-aged woman is standing behind the register. I hope this poor woman isn't married to that man.

""Good morning, dear. What can I get you?"" she says, smiling.

""Just a coffee, black.""

""You sure that you don't want anything else? You could use some protein.""

God have mercy and let me not snap at this nice woman. Men are another thing—they can fu-ck the he-ll off, whoever it is—but this nice lady will probably start crying if I let my temper takes the upper hand.

""I'm fine, thanks,"" I say, biting my cheek to not put a curse word in there.

""Well, here you go, and let me know if you change your mind,"" she says, giving me the coffee.

I take it 'to go' and drink it in the car. It's a little too early to visit my dad, so I drive to the gas station I saw when I drove here, to fill up the tank. There's a motel on the other side of the road. I might stop there later and take a shower before driving off to wherever the he-ll I'm going next.

I decide to wait until around noon before I drive toward the address. There doesn't seem to be many houses around this part of town, mostly trees and fields, but then, I spot a small road down to the left. The GPS says that it's here, but who the he-ll wants to live out here? 

I slow down and stop before turning in on the road, and I see a big as-s house further down. Is my dad one of those rich pricks? I'm sure that's why he didn't want me. He and mom weren't married, and I'm sure he didn't want a bast-ard.

Fu-cking as-shole.

I'm starting to get even more pissed at him and consider leaving the letter here on the road and hope he finds it...or I don't give a fu-ck and just drive off.

Just then, I hear the rumble of bikes and two bikers come driving and turn in on the road. They stop, and one of them gets off and walks to my car.

Fu-ck! Da-mn bikers.

He knocks on my window and I roll it down even if I rather tell him to piss off, then drive the he-ll out of here.

""What are you doing here, little darlin'?"" the big brute asks.

""I'm looking for John Carter.""

He looks over to the other biker, then turns to me again. ""What do you want with him?""

""Well, apparently, he's my fu-cking father and I have a letter to give him, but since you're here, you can give it to him and I'll be on my way,"" I say, starting to lose my temper.

""John doesn't have a daughter,"" he says, crossing his arms over his chest, and I'm starting to really lose my temper.

""Listen, you prick! My mom wrote me a letter, saying that my dad, whose name is John Carter and lives at this address, is my father. She wanted me to give him this letter. Either you shut your fu-cking mouth and let me in, or you take the godda-mn letter and give it to him. I don't give a fu-ck which one you choose, but rather the latter option so I can be on my way out of this sh-ithole.""

He smirks at me and motions me to drive down the road.

Fu-ck! Couldn't he have chosen the second option. I should've just shoved the godda-mn letter in his hand and sped off.

When I drive down to the big as-s house, I see a whole bunch of bikes standing outside.

Just fu-cking great.

I get out of my car with the letter in my hand, and take a deep breath. The big brute and his scrawny companion get off their bikes and motion me to follow them inside.

""Who's the new girl?"" another brute, sitting with a half-dressed bimbo on his lap, asks while checking me out.

Da-mn creep.

""Apparently, she's the Prez daughter,"" brute no 1 says, grinning like he doesn't believe a word I've said.

Well, he can just go fu-ck himself since I would rather not him being my dad either. And why the fu-ck is he called Prez?

""I can be your daddy,"" brute no 2 says, grinning and trying to look se-xy.

Barf!

The bimbo on his lap crosses her arms over her chest and gives him an evil glare.

""And I can be the one who cuts your balls off. Go fu-ck yourself!"" I snap at him.

""Oooh! Feisty.""

""What do you expect? She's a redhead,"" brute no 1 says, wiggling his eyebrows.

""For God fu-cking sake! Can you take me to John or not, or am I gonna have to stay here and listen to you perv motherfu-ckers for the rest of the day?""

They start to piss me the he-ll off, and I'm thinking about shoving the letter down his throat just to shut him the he-ll up. And why the he-ll is it that just redheads need to be feisty? I've got more auburn hair, just a tiny amount of freckles on my nose, and blue green eyes.

Before it all started to go to he-ll in my life, I was actually a really calm, nice girl—too nice—but when life hands you sh-it—a lot of sh-it in a small amount of time—it's hard to be nice anymore. Even the nicest person can snap, and then everyone can just piss the he-ll off, because it's easier that way. Got nothing to do with my fu-cking hair color.

""Jesus! You're one little spitfire, ain't ya?""

For the love of God. Can I just claw his tongue out...just a little?

""Shut up, you fu-cking perv!""

""We better get you to him before you get into a fight,"" brute no 1 chuckles.

""He and Kane are up in the Chapel,"" brute no 2 says.

Chapel? If my dad is some kind of high priest in a fu-cked-up biker cult, I'm gonna throw the letter in his face and run the he-ll out of here.

I follow brute no 1 up the stairs, then he knocks on a big door and I hear someone say, ""Enter.""

""Prez, I've got a little lady here looking for John Carter. Says she's your daughter.""

I hear a pen drop on the table, and then brute no 1 opens the door so I can walk inside.

At the end of a large oval table is a man in his late 40's with salt and pepper hair and beard. I guess that's my dad since the other one seems to be just a few years older than me. He's a lot larger than the other brutes here. He's the brute of brutes and has a face of stone.

If I wasn't pissed all the time and high on adrenaline, he would probably make me pee my panties out of fear. He's got blue eyes, a little longer, dirty blond hair on the top that he seems to run his fingers through a lot, because a strand of hair is now hanging se-xily down on his forehead. He's got a well-groomed beard and a lot of tattoos and muscles. He sits leaned back on his chair with his arms crossed over his chest and his feet crossed up on the table.

I turn to my so-called dad, and he's sitting there with his arms crossed over his chest.

""Who are you?"" he says with a cold tone.

""It doesn't matter. My mom wrote a letter to you, and I'm here to give it to you. Don't worry, I don't want anything from you, and you can just pretend that I wasn't even here."" I put the letter on the table, turn around and am about to walk out when he speaks again.

""What's your mother's name?""

I sigh. Shouldn't he know that, or does he have other women he impregnated and dumped?

Of course he does. Fu-cking as-shole.

""Sharon Lawrence.""

His eyes go big and he looks at me. I know that I look a lot like my mom. We have the same thick, long hair in the exact same color, but she had almond eyes, and I guess I inherited mine from this man, aka my dad.

""Why didn't she come here herself or send the letter to me?""

I feel like I'm gonna explode if I don't get out of here soon.

""Because she's dead, you fu-cking as-shole!"" I yell, then turn on my heels and quickly run out of there. I don't look back or at the fu-cking brutes and bimbos that's filled this big as-s house. They can have their fu-cking who-rehouse to themselves, and I'm actually glad that dad didn't want me and kicked mom out.

I quickly get into my car and speed off. God, I'm so fu-cking angry. I'm gonna explode if I don't run, otherwise I'll do something destructive.

I drive just right out of town and park my car on a small dirt road that leads into the woods. I get out and scream all my anger out, then start running. I'm like Forrest Gump right now. I feel like I could run through every continent of the world, and even that wouldn't get me tired.

I run until the sun starts to set, then decide to turn back the same way to get to my car before it gets dark. I'm all sweaty and need a shower, but I don't care right now. I crawl into the trunk and soon fall asleep.

Blade (John Carter)

I take the letter in my hand. She's dead. The love of my life, who left me almost 20 years ago, is dead...and I have a fu-cking daughter. When she said her name, I couldn't believe that I didn't see it at first. She's the spitting image of Sharon when she was younger.

""Prez,"" Kane says, looking worriedly at me.

Bull is still standing in the doorway, wanting to know what's going on. I just hold up my hand for them to be quiet, then open the letter and start reading it.

Hi, John.

If you're reading this, I'm afraid that it didn't end up so well for me. Don't worry, though, I had a good life. A calm life without worries or more betrayals. You did me wrong, but I know that you loved me. I never stopped loving you, but I couldn't forgive you. 

When I found out that I was pregnant, I knew that I had to keep our daughter away for her sake. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about her, but I can't change that now. If you received this letter, I guess you've met her. Her name is April and she was born the year after I left. She's the sweetest girl, stubborn like me, but nice to everyone. Maybe a little too nice sometimes.

April got a letter too. I'm sure that she'll be angry at me after reading it, because I always told her that you didn't want her and kicked me out, just so she would stay away. I know that it was wrong of me, but I had to keep her safe. I didn't want that life for her. 

I gave her your name and address to go and find you in case she needed protection, and to give you this letter. Even if she doesn't need your protection or want anything to do with you, I beg you to watch over her now when I'm gone. She doesn't have anyone else.

Love always, Sharon

I put my face in my hands and start crying. I never cry.

Kane grabs the letter and starts reading it. I try to compose myself and wipe away my tears. She's fu-cking gone. After all those years, I still loved her.

""Bull.""

""Yes, Prez,"" he says with a worried expression.

""Where did she go?""

""I don't know. She just ran out and drove off.""

""Fu-ck! You need to find her. She's my fu-cking daughter.""

""You sure about that, Prez?"" Kane says. ""I know what it says, but it could be fake.""

""No, she's the spitting image of Sharon, and it's her handwriting. I would recognize it anywhere even after all these years. Did you see her eyes?""

""Yeah, I know,"" he says, leaning back in his chair.

She's got my fu-cking eyes, that's for sure. Everything else is from Sharon.

Everyone here knows about Sharon. She was my old lady, but I messed up once. I was drunk as he-ll and let one of the Sweet butts give me head, and she walked in on us. Biggest mistake of my life that cost me the love of my life. I knew that I couldn't get her back. When she was set on something, there was no stopping her. She was stubborn and didn't take sh-it from anyone, even me. I never met anyone else after her. There wasn't anyone that could compare to her.

Bull reads the letter too. He scoffs and I raise a brow at him.

""Sorry, Prez, but her being too nice doesn't really fit the description of what I saw before she came in here. She was cursing like a sailor and was fu-cking pissed as he-ll. She was about to cut Knuckles balls off for hitting on her. I had to take her upstairs before she started a fight.""

I rub my face with my hands. ""Call Church.""

""Yes, Prez."" Bull steps outside the Chapel and yells, ""Church, now!""

I know that everyone is here right now, and I need to handle this.

Everyone piles in and sits down in their places. Kane is still to my right. He's the VP and took over after his old man died 5 years ago. Bull is our Sergeant-at-Arms, and Knuckles, my best Enforcer.

""You might've seen a young, red-haired woman barging out of here,"" I say to them.

""Yeah, she was about to rip me a new one. Feisty little thing,"" Knuckles says, chuckling.

""She's my daughter.""

""Oh,"" he says, and everyone looks surprised at me.

I tell them about the letter and about Sharon.

""I'm sorry, Prez,"" Doc says. He knew her too. He knew what I went through after she left, but I had only myself to blame.

""Hacker, I want you to find out how Sharon died, and I want all the in-fo you can get on my daughter. Her name is April Lawrence and she's 19. That's all I know. I don't even know where they lived. Kane, you take Bull and the Prospects with you and search the town. I want you to find her. Bull, you know what her car looks like. The rest of you, spread out. She couldn't have gone far. She might be pissed, but I need to know that she'll be okay. Bring her back here. I need to talk to her and sort everything out since Sharon didn't tell her the truth.""

""Yes, Prez,"" they all say and pile out.

""Kane, can you tell your mom to get up here? She needs to know too.""

""Sure, Prez,"" he says and walks out.

When I started this chapter of The Iron Predators, Kane's dad, Mac, was my VP. He and his old lady, Lydia, bought a house and moved out of the clubhouse when Kane was born. He was only 6 years old when Sharon left, so he just remembers bits and pieces of her.

Lydia and Sharon were best friends, so of course, she hated me too when Sharon left because of me, but we've become closer again over the years, especially after Mac died. She needed our support, and the club takes care of their own.

She works at the diner in town a few days a week and is here a lot in her free time. She cooks dinner for us most days, and we really appreciate it since she makes the best food and keeps the boys in check if they get too rowdy. She's like a momma bear that takes care of everyone.

""Hi, John,"" she says, walking into the Chapel.

""Hi, Lydia.""

""What's going on?""

I give her the letter and she reads it and starts crying. I hug her and we stand there crying together.

""I can't believe that she's gone too,"" she says, sobbing.

""Me neither. Did you know that she was pregnant when she left?""

""No, I didn't. She only called me once when she had settled down to let me know that she was okay, but that was the last time I heard from her. She said that it was too hard for her to keep in touch because she had to get over you, and she just wanted to try to start over. I guess she couldn't have kept it a secret from me if we kept talking either.""

""Do you know where she went?""

""Virginia. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, but that was for the best.""

""Yeah, I understand,"" I say, sighing. ""Kane and the boys are out looking for April right now. Apparently, she was pissed as he-ll and ripped Knuckles a new one when she came here.""

""Well, that boy had it coming,"" she scoffs. ""Poor girl. I don't blame her for being angry, though. She lost her mother and thinks that you didn't want her. You need to find her and help her, John.""

""I will.""

""Wait a minute,"" Lydia says. ""Does she have long, auburn hair, is short and skinny?""

""Yeah, she looks almost exactly like Sharon, but she's got my eyes.""

""Oh, I saw her at the diner this morning. She ordered a coffee to go. I asked her if she wanted anything else. She didn't seem healthy. Far too skinny.""

""Do you know if she stayed in town at the motel or something?""

""No, but Lloyd said that there was a car he hadn't seen before down in the parking lot behind the trees, and it was still there this morning when I opened.""

""What kind of car was it?""

""A navy blue station wagon of some sort.""

I call Bull. ""Hey, what car did you say April was driving?""

""A Volvo V70.""

""Color?""

""Navy blue.""

""Lydia says that her car was at the diner last night and this morning. If she didn't stay at the motel, she might've slept in her car.""

""We're at the motel right now, but she hasn't been here according to the manager.""

""Keep looking.""

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

""Sharon Lawrence."" Blade—my father—fixed his eyes on me, a distant, vacant look in them. I knew exactly why: I had my mom's face, almost identical.

""Why didn't she come here herself?""

""Because she's dead, you fu-cking as-shole!"" I choke out, the words practically a scream. 

""None of your business. My mom wrote a letter to you, and I'm here to give it to you. Don't worry, I don't want anything from you, and you can just pretend that I wasn't even here."" I put the letter on the table, then turn on my heels and quickly run out of there.

""Stop. April, stop!"" His yell rang out behind me. ""Kane. Follow her—keep her safe!""

The next second, I crashed hard into a chest as solid as stone. Kane!

He was a lot larger than any other biker I'd seen. He was got a well-groomed beard and a lot of tattoos and muscles. No question, the brute of brutes.

Before I can react, Kane leaned his head down, grabbed my thighs and threw me over his shoulder.

""Aaah! What the he-ll are you doing?"" I scream at him while he walks out of the room. ""Let me go, you fu-cking ape!""

""Listen,"" he said sternly. Then a slap on my as-s.

""Don't try to run. Because me—you can't prank.""

——

""Ever heard of overtraining syndrome?"" the young guy behind the desk at the gym asks when I'm about to run back home. I've been running here and working out for two and a half hours for the third day in a row.

""Ever heard of 'shut the fu-ck up and mind your own fu-cking business' syndrome?"" I snap at him, making him lean back in his chair with his hands in the air.

""Jeez!""

I push the door open, fix my ponytail that's gotten a little loose, then start my 30-minute run home. I don't even want to go home. I hate that house. I'm glad that it's sold, but they're not moving in until next week, and I have to decide where I'm gonna live before leaving.

Isn't that something you do before you decide to sell your home, you think. Well, fu-ck you and mind your own godda-mn business. I've got my reasons for selling it as soon as possible...without having the slightest idea of where I'm gonna live from now on. One thing I know is that I'm not going back to college.

When I'm home, I take a shower, then grab a frozen meal and put it in the microwave. I eat, then continue to pack stuff in boxes. I've donated everything, both small decorations and furniture, to Goodwill. They'll pick everything up tomorrow. All I'm keeping are my clothes. I don't want anything else. I would rather just leave everything like it is than having to pack it away, because it still hurts, but I'm done crying. I would rather be angry and hate the world right now. It's easier than being sad.

I'm up almost all night, packing. I don't get much sleep anyway.

The next day, two guys from Goodwill come with a truck and carry everything inside. I kept a mattress, pillow and cover so I have something to sleep on. When they're done and the house is totally empty, I go for a long run. 

Running and working out is the only thing that keeps me sane. I have all this energy from all the pent-up anger, and if I don't do something to get myself tired, I'm afraid I'll explode. The thing is, I don't seem to get tired no matter how much I run or work out, but it helps...a little.

The day after, I decide that it's time for me to leave. I thought that all the things that held memories in this house were worse to have around, but it turns out that being in this house without them, in an empty shell, is even worse. There's nothing left now and I have no reason to stay here any longer.

I fold down the backseats in my Volvo V70 and put the mattress, pillow and cover there in case I need to sleep in the car for some nights. I already got the money for the house, so I can rent a place, but I need to know where I'm gonna stay first.

I walk up to my bedroom, take my suitcase and the letter that was lying beside my mattress on the floor. I take one last look around, then close the door behind me and drive off. The other letter, I burned after reading it. I just tore off the part with my dad's address on it. That's where I'm going first, to give him his letter.

I thought about burning that one too. Why should I give him a letter from mom when he didn't even want me? That's why mom left all those years ago when she found out that she was pregnant. He didn't want me, and that's why I never asked mom about him. Now, she wants me to give him a letter, and since I don't know where to go, I can at least go there first and drop it off.

The drive from Virginia to Texas takes two days with only a few small breaks. I stop at night to sleep a few hours in my car.

I check my GPS to find this little sh-ithole that I'm going to. It's a tiny town not far from New Mexico, and if I don't find my dad here, I'm sure that someone knows where he is or can give him the letter so I don't have to. It's the kind of town that you can't step your foot into as an outsider without everyone knowing.

I decide to sleep in my car one more night before going to the address that was written in the letter. I park in the far corner of a parking lot outside of a diner. There are a few trees around, and the windows in the back are tinted, so I hope no one will notice me sleeping here.

I walk into the diner to grab some food before bed, or in this case, mattress in the car.

""Hi, what can I get you, darlin'?"" a middle-aged, not so fit man asks me. He seems to be having more body hair peeking out of his shirt than on top of his head. He stands behind the register, chewing gum really loudly with his mouth open. He checks me out, and I feel like puking all over him, let him clean up, then puke all over him again.

""A burger and fries.""

""Want a coke or something with that?""

""Sure,"" I say, looking at the menu on the wall beside the counter, trying to soothe my gag reflex. I really hope that he's not the chef too, but by the looks of his stained, greasy shirt, he is.

While I'm sitting there eating, I hear the rumble of bikes, and I soon see a whole gang of bikers drive by.

Good, they didn't stop.

I loathe bikers from the bottom of my heart. They're not what started my dislike for the whole wide world, but they're the ones that really got me hatin', like they say here in Texas.

I quickly eat up my burger since Chewbacca behind the register is still ogling me.

Perv.

I wonder if it's such a good idea to sleep outside the diner in my car, but I don't want to go further into town yet, and my car is at least a little hidden. It's not like I'm gonna sleep that much anyway.

I walk to my car, open the trunk, crawl in and close and lock it. It's kind of cozy here. I rather sleep in my car than in a run-down motel room. At least it's clean and I've got my own mattress that doesn't have old dried up semen stains on it. I might rent a room just to get a shower once in a while before I know where I'm going and can get something more permanent.

I wake up early the next day, and since I don't want to show myself too much in this town—since I only plan on giving the letter to my dad and drive the he-ll out of here—I guess I have to visit Chewbacca again for breakfast...or at least a coffee to calm my already angry mind.

Even if I'm always up early nowadays, I'm not really a morning person. I need coffee, and preferably a long run or a few hours at the gym to be somewhat of a not so pissed off person. But like I told you, I hardly get tired anymore no matter how much I try. I just still have my morning temper...that now is kind of stuck throughout the whole day.

Luckily, there's no sight of Chewbacca. A kind-looking, middle-aged woman is standing behind the register. I hope this poor woman isn't married to that man.

""Good morning, dear. What can I get you?"" she says, smiling.

""Just a coffee, black.""

""You sure that you don't want anything else? You could use some protein.""

God have mercy and let me not snap at this nice woman. Men are another thing—they can fu-ck the he-ll off, whoever it is—but this nice lady will probably start crying if I let my temper takes the upper hand.

""I'm fine, thanks,"" I say, biting my cheek to not put a curse word in there.

""Well, here you go, and let me know if you change your mind,"" she says, giving me the coffee.

I take it 'to go' and drink it in the car. It's a little too early to visit my dad, so I drive to the gas station I saw when I drove here, to fill up the tank. There's a motel on the other side of the road. I might stop there later and take a shower before driving off to wherever the he-ll I'm going next.

I decide to wait until around noon before I drive toward the address. There doesn't seem to be many houses around this part of town, mostly trees and fields, but then, I spot a small road down to the left. The GPS says that it's here, but who the he-ll wants to live out here? 

I slow down and stop before turning in on the road, and I see a big as-s house further down. Is my dad one of those rich pricks? I'm sure that's why he didn't want me. He and mom weren't married, and I'm sure he didn't want a bast-ard.

Fu-cking as-shole.

I'm starting to get even more pissed at him and consider leaving the letter here on the road and hope he finds it...or I don't give a fu-ck and just drive off.

Just then, I hear the rumble of bikes and two bikers come driving and turn in on the road. They stop, and one of them gets off and walks to my car.

Fu-ck! Da-mn bikers.

He knocks on my window and I roll it down even if I rather tell him to piss off, then drive the he-ll out of here.

""What are you doing here, little darlin'?"" the big brute asks.

""I'm looking for John Carter.""

He looks over to the other biker, then turns to me again. ""What do you want with him?""

""Well, apparently, he's my fu-cking father and I have a letter to give him, but since you're here, you can give it to him and I'll be on my way,"" I say, starting to lose my temper.

""John doesn't have a daughter,"" he says, crossing his arms over his chest, and I'm starting to really lose my temper.

""Listen, you prick! My mom wrote me a letter, saying that my dad, whose name is John Carter and lives at this address, is my father. She wanted me to give him this letter. Either you shut your fu-cking mouth and let me in, or you take the godda-mn letter and give it to him. I don't give a fu-ck which one you choose, but rather the latter option so I can be on my way out of this sh-ithole.""

He smirks at me and motions me to drive down the road.

Fu-ck! Couldn't he have chosen the second option. I should've just shoved the godda-mn letter in his hand and sped off.

When I drive down to the big as-s house, I see a whole bunch of bikes standing outside.

Just fu-cking great.

I get out of my car with the letter in my hand, and take a deep breath. The big brute and his scrawny companion get off their bikes and motion me to follow them inside.

""Who's the new girl?"" another brute, sitting with a half-dressed bimbo on his lap, asks while checking me out.

Da-mn creep.

""Apparently, she's the Prez daughter,"" brute no 1 says, grinning like he doesn't believe a word I've said.

Well, he can just go fu-ck himself since I would rather not him being my dad either. And why the fu-ck is he called Prez?

""I can be your daddy,"" brute no 2 says, grinning and trying to look se-xy.

Barf!

The bimbo on his lap crosses her arms over her chest and gives him an evil glare.

""And I can be the one who cuts your balls off. Go fu-ck yourself!"" I snap at him.

""Oooh! Feisty.""

""What do you expect? She's a redhead,"" brute no 1 says, wiggling his eyebrows.

""For God fu-cking sake! Can you take me to John or not, or am I gonna have to stay here and listen to you perv motherfu-ckers for the rest of the day?""

They start to piss me the he-ll off, and I'm thinking about shoving the letter down his throat just to shut him the he-ll up. And why the he-ll is it that just redheads need to be feisty? I've got more auburn hair, just a tiny amount of freckles on my nose, and blue green eyes.

Before it all started to go to he-ll in my life, I was actually a really calm, nice girl—too nice—but when life hands you sh-it—a lot of sh-it in a small amount of time—it's hard to be nice anymore. Even the nicest person can snap, and then everyone can just piss the he-ll off, because it's easier that way. Got nothing to do with my fu-cking hair color.

""Jesus! You're one little spitfire, ain't ya?""

For the love of God. Can I just claw his tongue out...just a little?

""Shut up, you fu-cking perv!""

""We better get you to him before you get into a fight,"" brute no 1 chuckles.

""He and Kane are up in the Chapel,"" brute no 2 says.

Chapel? If my dad is some kind of high priest in a fu-cked-up biker cult, I'm gonna throw the letter in his face and run the he-ll out of here.

I follow brute no 1 up the stairs, then he knocks on a big door and I hear someone say, ""Enter.""

""Prez, I've got a little lady here looking for John Carter. Says she's your daughter.""

I hear a pen drop on the table, and then brute no 1 opens the door so I can walk inside.

At the end of a large oval table is a man in his late 40's with salt and pepper hair and beard. I guess that's my dad since the other one seems to be just a few years older than me. He's a lot larger than the other brutes here. He's the brute of brutes and has a face of stone.

If I wasn't pissed all the time and high on adrenaline, he would probably make me pee my panties out of fear. He's got blue eyes, a little longer, dirty blond hair on the top that he seems to run his fingers through a lot, because a strand of hair is now hanging se-xily down on his forehead. He's got a well-groomed beard and a lot of tattoos and muscles. He sits leaned back on his chair with his arms crossed over his chest and his feet crossed up on the table.

I turn to my so-called dad, and he's sitting there with his arms crossed over his chest.

""Who are you?"" he says with a cold tone.

""It doesn't matter. My mom wrote a letter to you, and I'm here to give it to you. Don't worry, I don't want anything from you, and you can just pretend that I wasn't even here."" I put the letter on the table, turn around and am about to walk out when he speaks again.

""What's your mother's name?""

I sigh. Shouldn't he know that, or does he have other women he impregnated and dumped?

Of course he does. Fu-cking as-shole.

""Sharon Lawrence.""

His eyes go big and he looks at me. I know that I look a lot like my mom. We have the same thick, long hair in the exact same color, but she had almond eyes, and I guess I inherited mine from this man, aka my dad.

""Why didn't she come here herself or send the letter to me?""

I feel like I'm gonna explode if I don't get out of here soon.

""Because she's dead, you fu-cking as-shole!"" I yell, then turn on my heels and quickly run out of there. I don't look back or at the fu-cking brutes and bimbos that's filled this big as-s house. They can have their fu-cking who-rehouse to themselves, and I'm actually glad that dad didn't want me and kicked mom out.

I quickly get into my car and speed off. God, I'm so fu-cking angry. I'm gonna explode if I don't run, otherwise I'll do something destructive.

I drive just right out of town and park my car on a small dirt road that leads into the woods. I get out and scream all my anger out, then start running. I'm like Forrest Gump right now. I feel like I could run through every continent of the world, and even that wouldn't get me tired.

I run until the sun starts to set, then decide to turn back the same way to get to my car before it gets dark. I'm all sweaty and need a shower, but I don't care right now. I crawl into the trunk and soon fall asleep.

Blade (John Carter)

I take the letter in my hand. She's dead. The love of my life, who left me almost 20 years ago, is dead...and I have a fu-cking daughter. When she said her name, I couldn't believe that I didn't see it at first. She's the spitting image of Sharon when she was younger.

""Prez,"" Kane says, looking worriedly at me.

Bull is still standing in the doorway, wanting to know what's going on. I just hold up my hand for them to be quiet, then open the letter and start reading it.

Hi, John.

If you're reading this, I'm afraid that it didn't end up so well for me. Don't worry, though, I had a good life. A calm life without worries or more betrayals. You did me wrong, but I know that you loved me. I never stopped loving you, but I couldn't forgive you. 

When I found out that I was pregnant, I knew that I had to keep our daughter away for her sake. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about her, but I can't change that now. If you received this letter, I guess you've met her. Her name is April and she was born the year after I left. She's the sweetest girl, stubborn like me, but nice to everyone. Maybe a little too nice sometimes.

April got a letter too. I'm sure that she'll be angry at me after reading it, because I always told her that you didn't want her and kicked me out, just so she would stay away. I know that it was wrong of me, but I had to keep her safe. I didn't want that life for her. 

I gave her your name and address to go and find you in case she needed protection, and to give you this letter. Even if she doesn't need your protection or want anything to do with you, I beg you to watch over her now when I'm gone. She doesn't have anyone else.

Love always, Sharon

I put my face in my hands and start crying. I never cry.

Kane grabs the letter and starts reading it. I try to compose myself and wipe away my tears. She's fu-cking gone. After all those years, I still loved her.

""Bull.""

""Yes, Prez,"" he says with a worried expression.

""Where did she go?""

""I don't know. She just ran out and drove off.""

""Fu-ck! You need to find her. She's my fu-cking daughter.""

""You sure about that, Prez?"" Kane says. ""I know what it says, but it could be fake.""

""No, she's the spitting image of Sharon, and it's her handwriting. I would recognize it anywhere even after all these years. Did you see her eyes?""

""Yeah, I know,"" he says, leaning back in his chair.

She's got my fu-cking eyes, that's for sure. Everything else is from Sharon.

Everyone here knows about Sharon. She was my old lady, but I messed up once. I was drunk as he-ll and let one of the Sweet butts give me head, and she walked in on us. Biggest mistake of my life that cost me the love of my life. I knew that I couldn't get her back. When she was set on something, there was no stopping her. She was stubborn and didn't take sh-it from anyone, even me. I never met anyone else after her. There wasn't anyone that could compare to her.

Bull reads the letter too. He scoffs and I raise a brow at him.

""Sorry, Prez, but her being too nice doesn't really fit the description of what I saw before she came in here. She was cursing like a sailor and was fu-cking pissed as he-ll. She was about to cut Knuckles balls off for hitting on her. I had to take her upstairs before she started a fight.""

I rub my face with my hands. ""Call Church.""

""Yes, Prez."" Bull steps outside the Chapel and yells, ""Church, now!""

I know that everyone is here right now, and I need to handle this.

Everyone piles in and sits down in their places. Kane is still to my right. He's the VP and took over after his old man died 5 years ago. Bull is our Sergeant-at-Arms, and Knuckles, my best Enforcer.

""You might've seen a young, red-haired woman barging out of here,"" I say to them.

""Yeah, she was about to rip me a new one. Feisty little thing,"" Knuckles says, chuckling.

""She's my daughter.""

""Oh,"" he says, and everyone looks surprised at me.

I tell them about the letter and about Sharon.

""I'm sorry, Prez,"" Doc says. He knew her too. He knew what I went through after she left, but I had only myself to blame.

""Hacker, I want you to find out how Sharon died, and I want all the in-fo you can get on my daughter. Her name is April Lawrence and she's 19. That's all I know. I don't even know where they lived. Kane, you take Bull and the Prospects with you and search the town. I want you to find her. Bull, you know what her car looks like. The rest of you, spread out. She couldn't have gone far. She might be pissed, but I need to know that she'll be okay. Bring her back here. I need to talk to her and sort everything out since Sharon didn't tell her the truth.""

""Yes, Prez,"" they all say and pile out.

""Kane, can you tell your mom to get up here? She needs to know too.""

""Sure, Prez,"" he says and walks out.

When I started this chapter of The Iron Predators, Kane's dad, Mac, was my VP. He and his old lady, Lydia, bought a house and moved out of the clubhouse when Kane was born. He was only 6 years old when Sharon left, so he just remembers bits and pieces of her.

Lydia and Sharon were best friends, so of course, she hated me too when Sharon left because of me, but we've become closer again over the years, especially after Mac died. She needed our support, and the club takes care of their own.

She works at the diner in town a few days a week and is here a lot in her free time. She cooks dinner for us most days, and we really appreciate it since she makes the best food and keeps the boys in check if they get too rowdy. She's like a momma bear that takes care of everyone.

""Hi, John,"" she says, walking into the Chapel.

""Hi, Lydia.""

""What's going on?""

I give her the letter and she reads it and starts crying. I hug her and we stand there crying together.

""I can't believe that she's gone too,"" she says, sobbing.

""Me neither. Did you know that she was pregnant when she left?""

""No, I didn't. She only called me once when she had settled down to let me know that she was okay, but that was the last time I heard from her. She said that it was too hard for her to keep in touch because she had to get over you, and she just wanted to try to start over. I guess she couldn't have kept it a secret from me if we kept talking either.""

""Do you know where she went?""

""Virginia. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, but that was for the best.""

""Yeah, I understand,"" I say, sighing. ""Kane and the boys are out looking for April right now. Apparently, she was pissed as he-ll and ripped Knuckles a new one when she came here.""

""Well, that boy had it coming,"" she scoffs. ""Poor girl. I don't blame her for being angry, though. She lost her mother and thinks that you didn't want her. You need to find her and help her, John.""

""I will.""

""Wait a minute,"" Lydia says. ""Does she have long, auburn hair, is short and skinny?""

""Yeah, she looks almost exactly like Sharon, but she's got my eyes.""

""Oh, I saw her at the diner this morning. She ordered a coffee to go. I asked her if she wanted anything else. She didn't seem healthy. Far too skinny.""

""Do you know if she stayed in town at the motel or something?""

""No, but Lloyd said that there was a car he hadn't seen before down in the parking lot behind the trees, and it was still there this morning when I opened.""

""What kind of car was it?""

""A navy blue station wagon of some sort.""

I call Bull. ""Hey, what car did you say April was driving?""

""A Volvo V70.""

""Color?""

""Navy blue.""

""Lydia says that her car was at the diner last night and this morning. If she didn't stay at the motel, she might've slept in her car.""

""We're at the motel right now, but she hasn't been here according to the manager.""

""Keep looking.""

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

""Sharon Lawrence."" Blade—my father—fixed his eyes on me, a distant, vacant look in them. I knew exactly why: I had my mom's face, almost identical.

""Why didn't she come here herself?""

""Because she's dead, you fu-cking as-shole!"" I choke out, the words practically a scream. 

""None of your business. My mom wrote a letter to you, and I'm here to give it to you. Don't worry, I don't want anything from you, and you can just pretend that I wasn't even here."" I put the letter on the table, then turn on my heels and quickly run out of there.

""Stop. April, stop!"" His yell rang out behind me. ""Kane. Follow her—keep her safe!""

The next second, I crashed hard into a chest as solid as stone. Kane!

He was a lot larger than any other biker I'd seen. He was got a well-groomed beard and a lot of tattoos and muscles. No question, the brute of brutes.

Before I can react, Kane leaned his head down, grabbed my thighs and threw me over his shoulder.

""Aaah! What the he-ll are you doing?"" I scream at him while he walks out of the room. ""Let me go, you fu-cking ape!""

""Listen,"" he said sternly. Then a slap on my as-s.

""Don't try to run. Because me—you can't prank.""

——

""Ever heard of overtraining syndrome?"" the young guy behind the desk at the gym asks when I'm about to run back home. I've been running here and working out for two and a half hours for the third day in a row.

""Ever heard of 'shut the fu-ck up and mind your own fu-cking business' syndrome?"" I snap at him, making him lean back in his chair with his hands in the air.

""Jeez!""

I push the door open, fix my ponytail that's gotten a little loose, then start my 30-minute run home. I don't even want to go home. I hate that house. I'm glad that it's sold, but they're not moving in until next week, and I have to decide where I'm gonna live before leaving.

Isn't that something you do before you decide to sell your home, you think. Well, fu-ck you and mind your own godda-mn business. I've got my reasons for selling it as soon as possible...without having the slightest idea of where I'm gonna live from now on. One thing I know is that I'm not going back to college.

When I'm home, I take a shower, then grab a frozen meal and put it in the microwave. I eat, then continue to pack stuff in boxes. I've donated everything, both small decorations and furniture, to Goodwill. They'll pick everything up tomorrow. All I'm keeping are my clothes. I don't want anything else. I would rather just leave everything like it is than having to pack it away, because it still hurts, but I'm done crying. I would rather be angry and hate the world right now. It's easier than being sad.

I'm up almost all night, packing. I don't get much sleep anyway.

The next day, two guys from Goodwill come with a truck and carry everything inside. I kept a mattress, pillow and cover so I have something to sleep on. When they're done and the house is totally empty, I go for a long run. 

Running and working out is the only thing that keeps me sane. I have all this energy from all the pent-up anger, and if I don't do something to get myself tired, I'm afraid I'll explode. The thing is, I don't seem to get tired no matter how much I run or work out, but it helps...a little.

The day after, I decide that it's time for me to leave. I thought that all the things that held memories in this house were worse to have around, but it turns out that being in this house without them, in an empty shell, is even worse. There's nothing left now and I have no reason to stay here any longer.

I fold down the backseats in my Volvo V70 and put the mattress, pillow and cover there in case I need to sleep in the car for some nights. I already got the money for the house, so I can rent a place, but I need to know where I'm gonna stay first.

I walk up to my bedroom, take my suitcase and the letter that was lying beside my mattress on the floor. I take one last look around, then close the door behind me and drive off. The other letter, I burned after reading it. I just tore off the part with my dad's address on it. That's where I'm going first, to give him his letter.

I thought about burning that one too. Why should I give him a letter from mom when he didn't even want me? That's why mom left all those years ago when she found out that she was pregnant. He didn't want me, and that's why I never asked mom about him. Now, she wants me to give him a letter, and since I don't know where to go, I can at least go there first and drop it off.

The drive from Virginia to Texas takes two days with only a few small breaks. I stop at night to sleep a few hours in my car.

I check my GPS to find this little sh-ithole that I'm going to. It's a tiny town not far from New Mexico, and if I don't find my dad here, I'm sure that someone knows where he is or can give him the letter so I don't have to. It's the kind of town that you can't step your foot into as an outsider without everyone knowing.

I decide to sleep in my car one more night before going to the address that was written in the letter. I park in the far corner of a parking lot outside of a diner. There are a few trees around, and the windows in the back are tinted, so I hope no one will notice me sleeping here.

I walk into the diner to grab some food before bed, or in this case, mattress in the car.

""Hi, what can I get you, darlin'?"" a middle-aged, not so fit man asks me. He seems to be having more body hair peeking out of his shirt than on top of his head. He stands behind the register, chewing gum really loudly with his mouth open. He checks me out, and I feel like puking all over him, let him clean up, then puke all over him again.

""A burger and fries.""

""Want a coke or something with that?""

""Sure,"" I say, looking at the menu on the wall beside the counter, trying to soothe my gag reflex. I really hope that he's not the chef too, but by the looks of his stained, greasy shirt, he is.

While I'm sitting there eating, I hear the rumble of bikes, and I soon see a whole gang of bikers drive by.

Good, they didn't stop.

I loathe bikers from the bottom of my heart. They're not what started my dislike for the whole wide world, but they're the ones that really got me hatin', like they say here in Texas.

I quickly eat up my burger since Chewbacca behind the register is still ogling me.

Perv.

I wonder if it's such a good idea to sleep outside the diner in my car, but I don't want to go further into town yet, and my car is at least a little hidden. It's not like I'm gonna sleep that much anyway.

I walk to my car, open the trunk, crawl in and close and lock it. It's kind of cozy here. I rather sleep in my car than in a run-down motel room. At least it's clean and I've got my own mattress that doesn't have old dried up semen stains on it. I might rent a room just to get a shower once in a while before I know where I'm going and can get something more permanent.

I wake up early the next day, and since I don't want to show myself too much in this town—since I only plan on giving the letter to my dad and drive the he-ll out of here—I guess I have to visit Chewbacca again for breakfast...or at least a coffee to calm my already angry mind.

Even if I'm always up early nowadays, I'm not really a morning person. I need coffee, and preferably a long run or a few hours at the gym to be somewhat of a not so pissed off person. But like I told you, I hardly get tired anymore no matter how much I try. I just still have my morning temper...that now is kind of stuck throughout the whole day.

Luckily, there's no sight of Chewbacca. A kind-looking, middle-aged woman is standing behind the register. I hope this poor woman isn't married to that man.

""Good morning, dear. What can I get you?"" she says, smiling.

""Just a coffee, black.""

""You sure that you don't want anything else? You could use some protein.""

God have mercy and let me not snap at this nice woman. Men are another thing—they can fu-ck the he-ll off, whoever it is—but this nice lady will probably start crying if I let my temper takes the upper hand.

""I'm fine, thanks,"" I say, biting my cheek to not put a curse word in there.

""Well, here you go, and let me know if you change your mind,"" she says, giving me the coffee.

I take it 'to go' and drink it in the car. It's a little too early to visit my dad, so I drive to the gas station I saw when I drove here, to fill up the tank. There's a motel on the other side of the road. I might stop there later and take a shower before driving off to wherever the he-ll I'm going next.

I decide to wait until around noon before I drive toward the address. There doesn't seem to be many houses around this part of town, mostly trees and fields, but then, I spot a small road down to the left. The GPS says that it's here, but who the he-ll wants to live out here? 

I slow down and stop before turning in on the road, and I see a big as-s house further down. Is my dad one of those rich pricks? I'm sure that's why he didn't want me. He and mom weren't married, and I'm sure he didn't want a bast-ard.

Fu-cking as-shole.

I'm starting to get even more pissed at him and consider leaving the letter here on the road and hope he finds it...or I don't give a fu-ck and just drive off.

Just then, I hear the rumble of bikes and two bikers come driving and turn in on the road. They stop, and one of them gets off and walks to my car.

Fu-ck! Da-mn bikers.

He knocks on my window and I roll it down even if I rather tell him to piss off, then drive the he-ll out of here.

""What are you doing here, little darlin'?"" the big brute asks.

""I'm looking for John Carter.""

He looks over to the other biker, then turns to me again. ""What do you want with him?""

""Well, apparently, he's my fu-cking father and I have a letter to give him, but since you're here, you can give it to him and I'll be on my way,"" I say, starting to lose my temper.

""John doesn't have a daughter,"" he says, crossing his arms over his chest, and I'm starting to really lose my temper.

""Listen, you prick! My mom wrote me a letter, saying that my dad, whose name is John Carter and lives at this address, is my father. She wanted me to give him this letter. Either you shut your fu-cking mouth and let me in, or you take the godda-mn letter and give it to him. I don't give a fu-ck which one you choose, but rather the latter option so I can be on my way out of this sh-ithole.""

He smirks at me and motions me to drive down the road.

Fu-ck! Couldn't he have chosen the second option. I should've just shoved the godda-mn letter in his hand and sped off.

When I drive down to the big as-s house, I see a whole bunch of bikes standing outside.

Just fu-cking great.

I get out of my car with the letter in my hand, and take a deep breath. The big brute and his scrawny companion get off their bikes and motion me to follow them inside.

""Who's the new girl?"" another brute, sitting with a half-dressed bimbo on his lap, asks while checking me out.

Da-mn creep.

""Apparently, she's the Prez daughter,"" brute no 1 says, grinning like he doesn't believe a word I've said.

Well, he can just go fu-ck himself since I would rather not him being my dad either. And why the fu-ck is he called Prez?

""I can be your daddy,"" brute no 2 says, grinning and trying to look se-xy.

Barf!

The bimbo on his lap crosses her arms over her chest and gives him an evil glare.

""And I can be the one who cuts your balls off. Go fu-ck yourself!"" I snap at him.

""Oooh! Feisty.""

""What do you expect? She's a redhead,"" brute no 1 says, wiggling his eyebrows.

""For God fu-cking sake! Can you take me to John or not, or am I gonna have to stay here and listen to you perv motherfu-ckers for the rest of the day?""

They start to piss me the he-ll off, and I'm thinking about shoving the letter down his throat just to shut him the he-ll up. And why the he-ll is it that just redheads need to be feisty? I've got more auburn hair, just a tiny amount of freckles on my nose, and blue green eyes.

Before it all started to go to he-ll in my life, I was actually a really calm, nice girl—too nice—but when life hands you sh-it—a lot of sh-it in a small amount of time—it's hard to be nice anymore. Even the nicest person can snap, and then everyone can just piss the he-ll off, because it's easier that way. Got nothing to do with my fu-cking hair color.

""Jesus! You're one little spitfire, ain't ya?""

For the love of God. Can I just claw his tongue out...just a little?

""Shut up, you fu-cking perv!""

""We better get you to him before you get into a fight,"" brute no 1 chuckles.

""He and Kane are up in the Chapel,"" brute no 2 says.

Chapel? If my dad is some kind of high priest in a fu-cked-up biker cult, I'm gonna throw the letter in his face and run the he-ll out of here.

I follow brute no 1 up the stairs, then he knocks on a big door and I hear someone say, ""Enter.""

""Prez, I've got a little lady here looking for John Carter. Says she's your daughter.""

I hear a pen drop on the table, and then brute no 1 opens the door so I can walk inside.

At the end of a large oval table is a man in his late 40's with salt and pepper hair and beard. I guess that's my dad since the other one seems to be just a few years older than me. He's a lot larger than the other brutes here. He's the brute of brutes and has a face of stone.

If I wasn't pissed all the time and high on adrenaline, he would probably make me pee my panties out of fear. He's got blue eyes, a little longer, dirty blond hair on the top that he seems to run his fingers through a lot, because a strand of hair is now hanging se-xily down on his forehead. He's got a well-groomed beard and a lot of tattoos and muscles. He sits leaned back on his chair with his arms crossed over his chest and his feet crossed up on the table.

I turn to my so-called dad, and he's sitting there with his arms crossed over his chest.

""Who are you?"" he says with a cold tone.

""It doesn't matter. My mom wrote a letter to you, and I'm here to give it to you. Don't worry, I don't want anything from you, and you can just pretend that I wasn't even here."" I put the letter on the table, turn around and am about to walk out when he speaks again.

""What's your mother's name?""

I sigh. Shouldn't he know that, or does he have other women he impregnated and dumped?

Of course he does. Fu-cking as-shole.

""Sharon Lawrence.""

His eyes go big and he looks at me. I know that I look a lot like my mom. We have the same thick, long hair in the exact same color, but she had almond eyes, and I guess I inherited mine from this man, aka my dad.

""Why didn't she come here herself or send the letter to me?""

I feel like I'm gonna explode if I don't get out of here soon.

""Because she's dead, you fu-cking as-shole!"" I yell, then turn on my heels and quickly run out of there. I don't look back or at the fu-cking brutes and bimbos that's filled this big as-s house. They can have their fu-cking who-rehouse to themselves, and I'm actually glad that dad didn't want me and kicked mom out.

I quickly get into my car and speed off. God, I'm so fu-cking angry. I'm gonna explode if I don't run, otherwise I'll do something destructive.

I drive just right out of town and park my car on a small dirt road that leads into the woods. I get out and scream all my anger out, then start running. I'm like Forrest Gump right now. I feel like I could run through every continent of the world, and even that wouldn't get me tired.

I run until the sun starts to set, then decide to turn back the same way to get to my car before it gets dark. I'm all sweaty and need a shower, but I don't care right now. I crawl into the trunk and soon fall asleep.

Blade (John Carter)

I take the letter in my hand. She's dead. The love of my life, who left me almost 20 years ago, is dead...and I have a fu-cking daughter. When she said her name, I couldn't believe that I didn't see it at first. She's the spitting image of Sharon when she was younger.

""Prez,"" Kane says, looking worriedly at me.

Bull is still standing in the doorway, wanting to know what's going on. I just hold up my hand for them to be quiet, then open the letter and start reading it.

Hi, John.

If you're reading this, I'm afraid that it didn't end up so well for me. Don't worry, though, I had a good life. A calm life without worries or more betrayals. You did me wrong, but I know that you loved me. I never stopped loving you, but I couldn't forgive you. 

When I found out that I was pregnant, I knew that I had to keep our daughter away for her sake. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about her, but I can't change that now. If you received this letter, I guess you've met her. Her name is April and she was born the year after I left. She's the sweetest girl, stubborn like me, but nice to everyone. Maybe a little too nice sometimes.

April got a letter too. I'm sure that she'll be angry at me after reading it, because I always told her that you didn't want her and kicked me out, just so she would stay away. I know that it was wrong of me, but I had to keep her safe. I didn't want that life for her. 

I gave her your name and address to go and find you in case she needed protection, and to give you this letter. Even if she doesn't need your protection or want anything to do with you, I beg you to watch over her now when I'm gone. She doesn't have anyone else.

Love always, Sharon

I put my face in my hands and start crying. I never cry.

Kane grabs the letter and starts reading it. I try to compose myself and wipe away my tears. She's fu-cking gone. After all those years, I still loved her.

""Bull.""

""Yes, Prez,"" he says with a worried expression.

""Where did she go?""

""I don't know. She just ran out and drove off.""

""Fu-ck! You need to find her. She's my fu-cking daughter.""

""You sure about that, Prez?"" Kane says. ""I know what it says, but it could be fake.""

""No, she's the spitting image of Sharon, and it's her handwriting. I would recognize it anywhere even after all these years. Did you see her eyes?""

""Yeah, I know,"" he says, leaning back in his chair.

She's got my fu-cking eyes, that's for sure. Everything else is from Sharon.

Everyone here knows about Sharon. She was my old lady, but I messed up once. I was drunk as he-ll and let one of the Sweet butts give me head, and she walked in on us. Biggest mistake of my life that cost me the love of my life. I knew that I couldn't get her back. When she was set on something, there was no stopping her. She was stubborn and didn't take sh-it from anyone, even me. I never met anyone else after her. There wasn't anyone that could compare to her.

Bull reads the letter too. He scoffs and I raise a brow at him.

""Sorry, Prez, but her being too nice doesn't really fit the description of what I saw before she came in here. She was cursing like a sailor and was fu-cking pissed as he-ll. She was about to cut Knuckles balls off for hitting on her. I had to take her upstairs before she started a fight.""

I rub my face with my hands. ""Call Church.""

""Yes, Prez."" Bull steps outside the Chapel and yells, ""Church, now!""

I know that everyone is here right now, and I need to handle this.

Everyone piles in and sits down in their places. Kane is still to my right. He's the VP and took over after his old man died 5 years ago. Bull is our Sergeant-at-Arms, and Knuckles, my best Enforcer.

""You might've seen a young, red-haired woman barging out of here,"" I say to them.

""Yeah, she was about to rip me a new one. Feisty little thing,"" Knuckles says, chuckling.

""She's my daughter.""

""Oh,"" he says, and everyone looks surprised at me.

I tell them about the letter and about Sharon.

""I'm sorry, Prez,"" Doc says. He knew her too. He knew what I went through after she left, but I had only myself to blame.

""Hacker, I want you to find out how Sharon died, and I want all the in-fo you can get on my daughter. Her name is April Lawrence and she's 19. That's all I know. I don't even know where they lived. Kane, you take Bull and the Prospects with you and search the town. I want you to find her. Bull, you know what her car looks like. The rest of you, spread out. She couldn't have gone far. She might be pissed, but I need to know that she'll be okay. Bring her back here. I need to talk to her and sort everything out since Sharon didn't tell her the truth.""

""Yes, Prez,"" they all say and pile out.

""Kane, can you tell your mom to get up here? She needs to know too.""

""Sure, Prez,"" he says and walks out.

When I started this chapter of The Iron Predators, Kane's dad, Mac, was my VP. He and his old lady, Lydia, bought a house and moved out of the clubhouse when Kane was born. He was only 6 years old when Sharon left, so he just remembers bits and pieces of her.

Lydia and Sharon were best friends, so of course, she hated me too when Sharon left because of me, but we've become closer again over the years, especially after Mac died. She needed our support, and the club takes care of their own.

She works at the diner in town a few days a week and is here a lot in her free time. She cooks dinner for us most days, and we really appreciate it since she makes the best food and keeps the boys in check if they get too rowdy. She's like a momma bear that takes care of everyone.

""Hi, John,"" she says, walking into the Chapel.

""Hi, Lydia.""

""What's going on?""

I give her the letter and she reads it and starts crying. I hug her and we stand there crying together.

""I can't believe that she's gone too,"" she says, sobbing.

""Me neither. Did you know that she was pregnant when she left?""

""No, I didn't. She only called me once when she had settled down to let me know that she was okay, but that was the last time I heard from her. She said that it was too hard for her to keep in touch because she had to get over you, and she just wanted to try to start over. I guess she couldn't have kept it a secret from me if we kept talking either.""

""Do you know where she went?""

""Virginia. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, but that was for the best.""

""Yeah, I understand,"" I say, sighing. ""Kane and the boys are out looking for April right now. Apparently, she was pissed as he-ll and ripped Knuckles a new one when she came here.""

""Well, that boy had it coming,"" she scoffs. ""Poor girl. I don't blame her for being angry, though. She lost her mother and thinks that you didn't want her. You need to find her and help her, John.""

""I will.""

""Wait a minute,"" Lydia says. ""Does she have long, auburn hair, is short and skinny?""

""Yeah, she looks almost exactly like Sharon, but she's got my eyes.""

""Oh, I saw her at the diner this morning. She ordered a coffee to go. I asked her if she wanted anything else. She didn't seem healthy. Far too skinny.""

""Do you know if she stayed in town at the motel or something?""

""No, but Lloyd said that there was a car he hadn't seen before down in the parking lot behind the trees, and it was still there this morning when I opened.""

""What kind of car was it?""

""A navy blue station wagon of some sort.""

I call Bull. ""Hey, what car did you say April was driving?""

""A Volvo V70.""

""Color?""

""Navy blue.""

""Lydia says that her car was at the diner last night and this morning. If she didn't stay at the motel, she might've slept in her car.""

""We're at the motel right now, but she hasn't been here according to the manager.""

""Keep looking.""

1p0cntd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p0cntd/the_key_turns_three_degrees_at_a_time/,The Key Turns Three Degrees at a Time,"I am not a character.I am the person who woke up on the morning of November 18, 2025, to find a hematite sphere the size of a billiard ball sitting in the exact center of my kitchen table. There was an unplayed voice memo on my phone—6 minutes and 12 seconds long—and my dog refused to cross the threshold, no matter how many times I called him.
I am whoever came next on the routing slip after Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Vale scrawled “No further entries authorized” across the final page.I am the analyst who opened the secure drop at 04:17, saw the updated manifest, and discovered the pelican case had been empty long before it ever left Washington.I am the one whose clearance was revoked retroactively, whose family was quietly reclassified as “non-essential personnel,” and whose left hand now carries five pale lines where three had been the day before.
I am you, thirty-six hours from this moment, when you finally press play on the new recording and hear a voice that is no longer Mara Ellison’s.It will be yours.And it will thank you for finishing the key.
The sphere has turned again while I write this.Three degrees.I did not hear it with my ears; I felt it in the silver fillings of my molars, the way one feels an oncoming subway train in the soles of the feet. The metal is blood-warm now, and four new grooves have appeared—perfectly parallel, perfectly equatorial, spaced exactly 38.2 millimeters apart. They were not there yesterday.

I was never meant to possess it. ENYO-12 tagged it, bagged it, and flew it to the new BLACK VAULT node beneath Cheyenne Mountain. That is what the manifest still claims. Yet when the transport reached the gate at 02:47, the driver found the case open and the sphere already here, waiting for me to come downstairs for coffee.
At the exact same second, my phone lit up. One new voice memo. No title.I have not played it.I know whose voice it will be.
Last night, at 03:12 precisely, every light in the house inverted. The darkness did not arrive; it was poured into the bulbs like ink. My daughter’s baby monitor picked up breathing that was not hers—slow, patient, the breathing of something that has waited twenty-six thousand years and has just realized it no longer needs to wait.
The dog has sat at the edge of the woods since dawn, staring at the tree line with his tail tucked and ears flat. Every seven minutes and seventy-six seconds he whines once, as though answering a question only he can hear.
I weighed the sphere again. It is 412 grams heavier than it was six hours ago.They are feeding.I believe I know the source of the additional mass.
My left hand keeps going numb. When sensation returns, there are faint pressure marks across the knuckles—three at first, then four. Not cuts. Not yet. Just calibrations.
The memo remains unplayed, the waveform frozen at 00:00:00, yet the spikes are already drawn, tall and slow, identical to the pattern found on Mara Ellison’s phone. The thumbnail claims the recording was made in my daughter’s bedroom.
I swore I would not open it.I lasted until the sphere turned another three degrees and the grooves became five.

I pressed play.
The voice that came was mine—my exact timbre, the one I hear inside my skull when I read silently—but the cadence was wrong by three percent, enough for the bones of my inner ear to register the lie.
“Thank you,” it said, warm, almost shy. “You kept the sphere close. That was polite.”
A soft click, like a tongue testing unfamiliar teeth.
“You measured the grooves. Good. Precision matters. There are one hundred and fifteen left. Exactly.”
My fillings vibrated at 0.3 hertz. The sphere answered with a sub-audible thrum that made the coffee in my mug dome upward against gravity.
“Every groove is a name,” the recording continued. “You already gave us four tonight. The fifth is almost ready. You can feel it in the back of your hand, can’t you? The skin there is thinner than you think.”
The pale lines darkened. Four became five. The flesh between them took on the dull sheen of hematite.
“Lieutenant Colonel Vale tried to stop the count. He signed the wrong line. We needed someone whose clearance could still be revoked retroactively. Someone whose daughter still sleeps beneath a monitor tuned to our frequency.”
The dog whined outside—once, precisely on schedule.
“We’re not cruel,” the voice said, almost apologetic. “We waited twenty-six thousand years for the conjunction. We can wait six more minutes for manners.”
The waveform flattened into a perfect sine. My phone’s battery leapt from forty-one percent to one hundred. The temperature in the room fell nine degrees between heartbeats.
“Playhead at two-eleven,” it whispered. “The exact second Dr. Ellison stopped being the last curator and became the first door. You’re holding the phone she died into. The microphone still carries a fleck of her. Taste it if you want proof.”
I did not.
“The sphere likes you. It is 413 grams heavier now. When it reaches 28.34 kilograms it will be complete, and you will be light enough to carry.”
Every light inverted again. Darkness bled from the fixtures like oil. From the baby monitor drifted my daughter’s voice—except she was twenty-three years old and addressing me by my service number.
“Three degrees,” the recording sighed, satisfied. “Click.”
The sphere turned. I felt it in the roots of my teeth, in the marrow of my femurs, in the ancient hindbrain that still remembers leopards.
“We left you the dog,” it said, “so you would have something left to bury that still possesses a soul. Everything else is negotiable.”
Then the looping began—my own voice layered 776 times, each iteration 0.3 hertz out of phase:
thankyouforfinishingthekeythankyouforfinishingthekeythankyoufor—
It ceased at 05:59. Twelve seconds of silence. Then one final sentence, gentle, almost loving.
“See you at conjunction plus thirty-six hours, curator.”
The memo ended.The playhead reset itself to the beginning.The thumbnail was no longer a thumbnail. It was live. My daughter’s breathing, slow and adult, every seventh inhale ending with my service number in a voice that has not yet learned to speak.
The sphere is warm enough to blister skin now.Six grooves.I miscounted the clicks.There are only one hundred and fourteen left.

Retrieval Team Log
Task Force ENYO-9 “Gravediggers”7 June 2025Smithsonian Castle, Sub-Level 7Clearance: BLACK VAULT / EYES-ONLY
Sergeant Daniel Reyes—thirty-three, Force Recon, South-Side Chicago—led the breach. His helmet camera recorded everything.
The level was nine degrees Celsius. Frost coated the walls like breath on a mirror.
“Thermal’s cold,” Reyes whispered. “Whole place feels like a meat locker.”
Dr. Park protested that the building was on emergency generators. Reyes told him to inform his testicles directly.
They found the final blast door already ajar, hinges bent outward as though something inside had grown impatient.
On the observation console lay a single iPhone 13 Pro, face-down, still warm, humming at 0.3 hertz. The file was titled ELLISON_FINAL.wav—6:12 exactly.
Reyes pressed play.
Dr. Mara Ellison’s voice filled the helmets—once crisp, academic, now ragged with thirst and something older.
“My name is still Dr. Mara Ellison,” she began. “Former Curator of Anomalous Lithics, Section 9. Current occupant of a level that will never appear on any tour map.”
She told them what they had truly been collecting for 129 years.
Spheres of hematite and pyrophyllite, older than the crust beneath their feet, each bearing perfectly parallel equatorial grooves. Any specimen exhibiting three or more was to be acquired by any means. “Any means” had never been figurative.
Seven hundred and seventy-six such spheres had been catalogued since 1896. All but the last fifteen were interred in lattice cradles two kilometers beneath the Vredefort Dome in South Africa. The lattice was never scattered; it was one machine, waiting for its index key—Specimen 00001-Alpha, an ungrooved sphere containing the compressed map of every groove on Earth.
She had placed the final pebble herself, taken from the dying hands of her predecessor in Cardiff, flown through customs in a lead film canister, and seated it in the last cradle thirty-six hours before Venus reached inferior conjunction for the first time in twenty-six millennia.
At 02:14 EST the circuit closed. Every sphere rotated three degrees. The dead began to speak with one voice:
Thank you for finishing the key.
“I will not be here when you arrive,” Ellison said. “Something needed a body that still remembered how doors work.”
A wet, ancient laughter swelled behind her words. Then an enormous thud against metal far below, and the recording ended with one slow inhalation that sounded like continents learning to breathe.
Reyes stared into his own camera, Chicago flat and calm.
“Command, if SecDef’s balls ain’t big enough for rods from God on Vredefort and Wilkes Land, drop a B-83 on this castle with us still in the basement. Tell my moms I went out loud, expensive, and somebody else’s problem.”
He primed thermite, set it beside the phone, and spoke a final South-Side prayer.
“Ellison, wherever you at, babygirl… hope you lied about that door only opening from the inside. ’Cause the South Side don’t do locked doors. We kick that motherfucker in and pay the landlord later.”
The thermite flared white. The feed cut.

Addendum
Submitted 8 June 2025, 04:17 ESTLt. Col. Marcus H. Vale, ENYO Command
No explosion registered on seismic. The blast door was found resealed from the inside, welds cooling at 1,400 °C with no trace of torch or residue.
ENYO-9’s bio-monitors flat-lined at the moment of ignition.
In place of the phone sat a single hematite sphere—Specimen 00001-Alpha—now bearing three hair-fine grooves freshly etched at its equator. It rotated three degrees while the recovery team watched, then stopped.
Every containment cradle on Earth was found empty, interiors mirror-polished and wet with 5.6 liters of mixed human blood.
A single heat signature—mass approximately 82 kilograms, colder than ambient air—was recorded ascending the service shaft and exiting through the roof vent. The thermal silhouette matched Dr. Mara Ellison.
At 03:12 the following morning, the National Mall public-address system activated for exactly 6.12 seconds. Every phone, radio, and baby monitor within forty kilometers carried the same chorus:
“Door’s open. Come in from the cold.”
We are no longer retrieving artifacts.The artifacts are retrieving us.
They turn three degrees at a time.One hundred and fourteen clicks remain.

1p0cjh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1p0cjh1/the_essence_of_courage/,The Essence of Courage,"Most advice online mixes up *confidence* and *courage*, and it creates a lot of confusion.

Confidence is simply “I know what I’m doing in this setting.”  
Courage is “I don’t know what’s going to happen — and I can handle all possible outcomes.”

Courage is **emotional digestion of uncertainty**.  
It’s not bravado. It’s not “don’t care what she thinks.”  
It’s the ability to:

* see the real range of outcomes
* accept them *emotionally*, not just logically
* act anyway, without self-delusion

Courage becomes easier as your understanding of the situation improves.  
It works exactly like risk analysis:

* Undefined outcomes → high emotional cost
* Defined outcomes → manageable emotional cost

This is why practicing social skills becomes less stressful over time.  
You map the terrain.  
The variance shrinks.  
The “worst case” loses its power.

And here’s the twist:

Courage is the real “inner game.”  
Outcome independence, aloofness, emotional stability — they’re not magic traits.  
They’re the *result* of having digested the full spectrum of outcomes and knowing you can handle them.

Courage isn’t mystical.  
It’s calculated emotional effort.

If anyone wants the full breakdown, Google:

-she likes to fly with her broom towards windows, hide inside bushes and spying on umamusumes that she find interesting

-the students tend to get scared of her look and aura but she doesn't mind

-she believes that at any bless there is a cost. there is nothing unlimited.

-she also believes in 'sacrificing 10 to save 1000'

-she is also a history teacher in tracen and due to her low and soft voice, students tend to sleep in her classes and even be said that her voice is like an ASMR (i imagine her having voiced by Natsuyoshi Yuuko, more prompt to how Shirai Yuyu from the anime Assault Lily Sounds). but only firefly stays awake due to history being her favourite.

-she have a cafe but only opens at certain time and no coffee, just tea. No arguement.

-sometimes she likes to make dark jokes.

-she likes to do random research such as ""Does Moe Moe Kyun Actually Have its Effects On Omurice?"" and ""Does Bonds Actually Boost Your Abilities?"" (where she just spying on umas interacting with each other: Spe-Suzu, Nishino-sky, Helios-Ruby)

-About other Umas:

-Daitaku Helios: her first ever trainee. despite being polar opposite in terms of personality, betelgeuse manage to still understands her. and yes, even the brainrots.

-King Halo: betelgeuse has been following her around and eventually King approach her and decided to be her trainee. she finds King to have a special hidden talent that she will look further into..

-Daiichi Ruby: After agreed to help helios with her training, ruby joined the team after the recommendations from others. betelgeuse sees that ruby might be a great motivator and also have hidden talents.

-Mejiro Mcqueen: mcqueen agrees to join her team after betelgeuse offers her. 

-Manhattan Cafe; she likes to visits the cafe and always have at least a cup of coffee once a day.

-Seiun Sky: she just never fathom with sky's laziness and always making sure sky is not slacking off

-Marvelous Sunday; she sees that Marvy have same energy as helios and wanted her to stay that way.

-Haru Urara: she just can't have any bad intentions upon the presence of urara. she is confused on why she just not want to tease urara even a dark joke. always offers urara strawberry tea anytime they met.


-others

-Asaru: asaru seem to be scared of her yet she finds her to cool

-Kottei-ryo: ryo finds betelgeuse to be funny and have Heebies-jeebies feeling.

-Avalon: avalon usually visits her office and she even attends his cafe once

-Firefly: betelgeuse likes to help firefly in baking sessions and felt her backstory to be relatable.

-NPC Trainer: despite how john feels down, she sees that he can be a great trainer and improves.

-Omniman: occasionally omniman offers help, especially during the time when King's mother called her.

It's not a fun time for me.  Over the years it's changed from something nice where I can spend the day doing things I like, to constantly being overlooked, used, manipulated, and friends who can't bother to take the time to spend even a few hours with me and overschedule themselves around the day so my birthday is an afterthought.  Something happened around my birthday back in 2023 that caused me to have a near-panic attack just buying myself my own cupcakes a year later, and I celebrated in my car with the cupcakes and numbered candles stacked on top of a coffee-stained book before driving 7 hours back home to work an 8 hour shift.  This year, I joined some friends who insisted they HAD to go to an event the weekend before my birthday and that it was the best timing for everyone, and so I went as it was the only thing I had planned for my birthday.  

More things happened, and I have been repeatedly reminded that I matter to no one.  Mildly, sure, but no one I connect with.  I haven't done ""connecting"" in a long time, not since my trust was so badly betrayed in 2023.  I feel like I'm on one side of a glass panel looking out to everyone else and they're all enjoying their lives and I'm just... here.

Last night I bought myself a cake I didn't have the energy to eat and band-aids.  

I didn't do anything.  But I was shaking.  I couldn't stop shaking.  I wanted to scream.  And I couldn't sleep well, and I've been cleaning up after the trip and I still can't stop shaking and crying.  My entire body hurts like I'm hungover and I'm not.  I'm so tired.

I know I have to keep doing this.  Day in and day out.  I know things will be okay.  I know there are better things in this world.  I know the darkness doesn't last forever.  I just wish it didn't hurt so bad.  I just wish there was anything in this world that made me feel like any of this was worth it.

I have to save myself, and I've had to do it every second of every day for the last fucking 12 years.  For once second I wish I didn't have to be strong.  I wish I could be angry.  Miserable.  Yell at everyone and say shit I'll regret and never talk to anyone ever again.  But alas, life goes on.

Staying better sucks, but I don't miss the constant pit in my stomach that I feel now.

My schedule:
	•	Wake up: 4:45-5AM 
	•	Take Adderall XR at 5:00–5:30 AM
	•	Small amount of coffee in the morning
	•	Break my fast around 12–1 PM with a tiny bit of coffee.
	•	Bedtime: 8:30 PM

What I’m on now:
	•	15 mg Adderall XR
	•	It’s been working pretty well.
	•	Sleep is good now and blood pressure is normal.
	•	I feel focused in the morning and less impulsive. And my focus is good and i’ve been doing a lot better in school. 


The problem:
	•	The effects fade around 12 PM
	•	I get more impulsive and lose focus after noon 
	•	Small coffee helps push focus until 4–5 PM, but then I crash hard 
	•	Some urges and impulsivity still break through
	•	By evening I’m mentally tired and get a little moody/grumpy


What I’m trying to figure out:
Since I wake up extremely early, maybe 15 mg XR doesn’t last long enough for my day.

I’m wondering if 20 mg XR would:
	•	Give longer coverage into the afternoon
	•	Help control impulsivity better
	•	Reduce the early afternoon drop
	•	Reduce the “crash” at 4–5 PM

But I don’t want to feel overstimulated or mess up my sleep, since 15 mg is smooth and mixes well with my small coffee.

Anyone who moved from 15mg XR → 20mg XR, how did it feel?
Did it help last longer without feeling too strong?

Thanks in advance. And I don’t want to give up coffee 😂!! It’s only a little bit in the morning I use 1/4 cup of grounded coffee into the coffee maker. And in the afternoon I get a small coffee fill it with ice and drink half. My appointments today.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

It’s as if retail managers collectively decided that the best way to boost sales is to make sure none of us can ever find half items we came in for. 

Shopping used to be a quick errand. Now it’s an adventure sport. You stand in the middle of the store, squinting at signs, spinning your cart in circles, trying to remember where the toilet paper lived before the Great Relocation. By the time you actually find it—nestled inexplicably between light bulbs and dog sweaters—you feel a sense of triumph usually reserved for archaeologists and treasure hunters. The coffee and tea aisle, amongst others, meanwhile, appear to have been relocated to a different zip code. 

Of course, when you finally ask an employee where something went, they always say, “Oh, we just moved that last week!” with a cheerful grin, as if to say, ""Isn't this fun?"" You smile, but inside, you’re wondering if they’re secretly competing to see which store can help the most people to meet their daily ""Steps"" goals.

At this point, I just treat every visit like an Easter Egg Hunt for adults: the eggs are scattered throughout the store, occasionally disguised as endcap promotions. And if I actually manage to leave with what I came for, I consider it a personal victory—one worthy of a celebratory chocolate bar… if I can find one of those again.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Whilst I was out at a local coffee shop I ran into a firefighter who works at the station not far from my place. We got talking and eventually traded numbers, he was good looking and he thought I was too.

A few days later he comes over to my apartment and we hooked up, we promised to keep it casual and let's just say he's really good in bed. His phone kept ringing but we ignored it, in favour of enjoying our night of passion. Afterwards we showed together and got back into bed, the ringing on his phone didn't stop so he threw it across my bedroom and fell asleep.

The next day I woke up and he was gone, which was expected. I check my phone and I have a message from him, saying he was supposed to be on shift and there had been a really bad house fire. His Captain was angry at him but it was worth it because I'm amazing in bed.

I felt guilty because our hook up cost someone their home but at least he liked what I did.

You know, super exciting, new job, new laptop, new Slack channels, trying to look smart while Googling every acronym people use.

Around noon they told me, “Hey, feel free to deploy something small to the databases, just to get familiar with the workflow.” And me, being the over-achiever I am, was like: “Of course! Easy!”

I pressed one button. Just one.

ONE.

And then… about 30 seconds later… I noticed my terminal froze. Then Grafana froze. Then people in Slack were like “anyone seeing weird DB latency?” Then more messages. Then more. Then someone from SRE: “Is anyone able to reach any database??”

Meanwhile I’m sitting there pretending to “take notes” but actually just sweating so hard that my MacBook trackpad stopped working.

It’s now been 2–3 hours and apparently… I don’t know… every database on Earth decided to take a vacation???

People are running around (digitally), opening incident bridges, saying words like “replication stall,” “global failover,” “why is this table EMPTY,” and “WHO TOUCHED THIS??”

And I’m just silently closing tabs like: “hahaha anyway what a funny coincidence, definitely not related to my 12:03 PM deployment that said ‘Operation completed successfully’ but made the fans on my laptop sound like a drone preparing for takeoff.”

If anyone sees this, I just want to say: I’m sorry. I swear I only changed one tiny thing. Well… technically I changed one variable… which triggered a migration… which triggered a reindex… which apparently triggered The Apocalypse™.

Anyway, if Cloudflare HR is reading this, I’d like to apologize in advance for my 7-hour tenure. It’s been an honor.

I’m gonna go make another coffee and pretend it’s not my fault. (Please, universe… let it not be my fault.)",23,1763473282.0,CloudFlare,4,1.0,False

1p0c7h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1p0c7h3/the_essence_of_courage/,The essence of courage,"Most advice online mixes up *confidence* and *courage*, and it creates a lot of confusion.

Confidence is simply “I know what I’m doing in this setting.”  
Courage is “I don’t know what’s going to happen — and I can handle all possible outcomes.”

Courage is **emotional digestion of uncertainty**.  
It’s not bravado. It’s not “don’t care what she thinks.”  
It’s the ability to:

* see the real range of outcomes
* accept them *emotionally*, not just logically
* act anyway, without self-delusion

Courage becomes easier as your understanding of the situation improves.  
It works exactly like risk analysis:

* Undefined outcomes → high emotional cost
* Defined outcomes → manageable emotional cost

This is why practicing social skills becomes less stressful over time.  
You map the terrain.  
The variance shrinks.  
The “worst case” loses its power.

And here’s the twist:

Courage is the real “inner game.”  
Outcome independence, aloofness, emotional stability — they’re not magic traits.  
They’re the *result* of having digested the full spectrum of outcomes and knowing you can handle them.

Courage isn’t mystical.  
It’s calculated emotional effort.

I’ve been cold plunging since October 1 every day at 50 to 55°. I get in the water quickly wait about 45 seconds then I dunk my head quick and stay in the cold plunge for a total of 2 1/2 to 3 minutes this is all shortly after a half a cup of coffee upon waking.

Then I go about my day I work everything’s fine in about an hour and a half to two hours before bed. I will do a 23 minute infrared sauna at 140 degrees.

I had to work out of town this one weekend and I couldn’t cold plunge at all first time in two months without cold plunge. Work was a little stressful and then I had a long drive home with someone who was driving recklessly roughly about a 3 Hour drive. I had a coffee kinda late in the day that day during the stressful drive and then when I got home, it was about midnight. I went to bed. I woke up. I jumped out of bed. Use the restroom like normal and boom. I could feel my heart fluttering completely out of rhythm. Like not even beating the way it’s supposed to. I went to the hospital and they said I was in afib two days later, they shocked my heart and now it’s back to normal.

Can anyone help me understand like what happened cause I want to cold plunge again safely. The cardiologist says he isn’t sure and can’t blame the cold plunge because it could be a bunch of different factors.",2,1763473222.0,coldplunge,3,1.0,False

Where: The Well Coffee Shop, 2410 Mishawaka Avenue, South Bend

When: Friday at 6pm-Saturday at 6pm officially

What: Join us for all the social games you can handle! We play regularly with around 20+ players, and this event is looking even better! We teach the game to new players of all ages, so bring your friends and family and get ready to lie and decieve them on your way to victory!

The Games: Werewolf and Blood on the Clocktower. Both games are very similar; there is a small team of players who know each other and must survive while a larger team of good players try and figure out who is who. Most of the gameplay is talking and figuring out information, truthful or not! Each game has many characters who get information every day, which adds even more fun to the puzzle!

Badges start at $15 and go to $25 for this event.

We will also be having chances to win free games, as well as tournaments where you can win, as well as special games that you may not see elsewhere!

Hopefully we will see you there,

Most of us think about our properties competing with other vacation rentals in our area. But what if we're competing with the wrong thing?

Hear me out:

When someone books a ""romantic weekend getaway,"" they're not really looking for a vacation rental - they're trying to reconnect with their partner. The default solution most couples do? Dinner and a movie for $150-200.

But if you position your property as the romantic gesture (firepit, chef's kitchen for a home-cooked meal, hot tub, cozy vibe) - you're suddenly competing with that dinner, not the STR down the street. And you're offering MORE value at a comparable price.

Same thing with families. They're not looking for a ""family-friendly rental"" - they're trying to create memories without breaking the bank at theme parks. If your property has a pool, game room, yard space, maybe near some hiking trails... you're now competing with that $500+ Disney trip. You win.

Remote workers aren't booking a ""workation"" - they're escaping burnout. You're competing with hotels and coffee shops, not other rentals.

**The shift:** Understand the REAL problem they're solving, then position your property as a better alternative to what they'd normally do.

This mindset has helped me think differently about marketing and pricing, especially during shoulder season.

Anyone else approach it this way?

The day of my birthday we got in an argument and he guilted me in to dinner the following day. Then during the dinner we argued about my budget. And he still hasn’t gotten me a card (what I really wanted because I am sentimental af). 

Long version:

I hate my birthday just as a general rule. It always falls during a rough time because everyone is either going or coming back from fall break, and when in school if that wasn’t the case midterms were also a thing. So I just rarely celebrate it. 

Enter my boyfriend who in the first year made it his mission to change that. His family threw me a party and I never have felt more celebrated than when I was a little child. It was amazing and they set the bar high for what birthdays should be. 

The filling birthday, he straight up forgot about  it though. Like no card no gift, not even ordering take out and he just said happy birthday to me and that was it. I was heart broken. We had just moved cities and I was feeling more alone than I probably should have. He vowed to never do that again because he saw my hurt. 

This year we another horrid birthday in my opinion. In September he told me that he was ordering my gift and he wanted to make sure I had a great birthday. Because if this I allowed my expectations to be set and to have a little hope. Turns out that he didn’t order my gift because he was worried it wouldn’t come in in time. 

So the night before he runs out to the store. But he recently had surgery and tripped over a bench and came home in pain. I was t even thinking about my gift at that point. I just hoped he didn’t undo what was done during his surgery. That’s when he breaks down crying, saying that he thought I was cheating on him and that’s why he tripped. I was speechless and still am when I think about it. 

So I pushed it down and told him that we will spend my birthday relaxing instead so he can heal from tripping. He wants to do dinner but I couldn’t handle having him be in pain and having to hear about. Or even worse there’s been times that we try to go out but if the chair isn’t right (pr he doesn’t get the comfier spot) he will end the date early because he’s in so much pain. So that’s why I said no to the dinner on my birthday. 

But he guilted me in to going the following day. So we did. And he proceeded to talk about my budget and offer his un solicited opinions about it. I told him many time that I am happy with my budget, that is it getting me through the periods where I done have income coming in and still allowing ent o go for coffee or participate in my hobbies. He thinks I should just take the five years and do nothing and pay down my student debt. I keep telling him I have found a balance that allows me to pay it down faster than average but still lets me live a tiny bit. 

Regardless throughout all of this he didn’t get me a gift. Or a card which is really what I want. I think cards are the sweetest, especially when they write a little note! But nothing. And now I just feel like poop about it because he did take me to a nice restaurant but it still feels like it was a horrible birthday. Maybe I’m reading in to it too much though.

By Liz Krieger, The Atlantic.

In my old life, I liked mornings, but I wasn’t a “morning person.” I would routinely stay up late watching TV or reading in bed and say yes to dinners that started long after nightfall. My relationship with mornings was casual—I’d occasionally enjoy a sunrise but I certainly never set an alarm to see one. Then I had children, whose needs demanded an early start, and I spent years stumbling out of bed at their first sounds, making breakfast, and building block towers before I’d fully woken up. Now they’re older, which means they’re less likely to need me before dawn. And yet I’ve found that I can’t shake the early-rising routine.

This is partly because my morning hours have come to feel sacred: They’re the only portion of the day reserved for just my own needs—and for a parent, that kind of time is hard to find. I also derive genuine satisfaction from my early productivity. As my wake-up time has inched earlier, I’ve written more, exercised more consistently, and been able to approach challenges with clarity, well before afternoon fatigue sets in.

But every transformation comes with a price. And mine has been paid in evening hours—those crucial moments when families traditionally reconnect after a day apart, when teenagers may be more likely to open up, when friends gather and marriages deepen in the comfortable darkness after responsibilities have been met. I have become a person who gives the best of herself to the morning and offers only the dregs to the night.

Gradually, my early-to-bed, early-to-rise nature has shaped our household’s rhythms. Mornings are my domain. I make breakfast, feed our three pets, and push everyone out the door. When my two daughters were younger, I’d make their lunch and walk them to school, my mug of coffee long drained. My husband prefers to stay up late, so he handles the evening-pickup runs, the printer problems that invariably surface the night before something is due, the random tidbits of adolescent info that seep out just as our kids are flagging. It’s an efficient arrangement, but it has created an unintended hierarchy in which I get our daughters’ foggy beginnings and he gets their vulnerable nighttime moments.",1,1763471706.0,atlanticdiscussions,0,1.0,False

My FIL had a brown ceramic mug that was my MIL’s favourite. Naturally, he became quite attached to it after she died.

 I liked the mug and would occasionally use it for tea/coffee. Of course, I did my best to be careful with it.

But tonight, as I was returning it to the kitchen, my arm bumped against the bench, which in turn caused the mug to fling straight to the floor.

  
The sound it made as it shattered was one of the worst sounds I’ve ever heard.

  
My wife was devastated. But now, I’m dreading owning up to my FIL about it. I love and respect him (and the feeling’s certainly mutual). However, anything related to my MIL is of course a sensitive spot. And I fear how angry and hurt he‘ll be because of my accident. And I’m worried that he’ll think less of me.

I have been with my partner for over 2.5yrs. I love him deeply and we are very affectionate, loving and close to one another. We are from the same continent (Europe)  but in different countries. I recently moved to a nearer country to him than my home country to study and so seeing each other is easier than before (cheaper, shorter distance, my living situation is better than before so he can visit me as well as me visiting him etc). Before we would see each other 3-4x a year, now it should be 6-7+ if finances go well.

He was recently in another European country for work and had to do a layover (no direct flights) on his way home. He decided to visit country A, country B and then country C (where I live) via interrail in order to take advantage of the travel. He said he’d be staying with friends in country A and B. He didn’t mention the genders at first.

Then a couple days later, he mentioned that in country A he’d be staying with a ‘childhood’ (mid-late teens) friend (20sF) that he hadn’t seen in 5+ years. They were summer friends that saw each other every summer in a town their families each have a home in in their home country for a few years before Covid. He had meant to meet up with her in August when their families resumed their annual trip, but didn’t end up going because of work. I had never heard about her before he mentioned her in August. She apparently has a boyfriend of her own. I didn’t mind them seeing each other then as it would’ve just been a coffee/getting an ice cream by the beach and it’s natural to want to catch up with someone who you haven’t seen for years.

I feel hurt that he didn’t mention that she was a woman when he first mentioned that he’d be visiting a friend in country A. I speak his native language (learnt it for him), which is a gendered language, and ‘friend’ has a masculine and feminine form. He just told me he was be staying with ‘friends’ in countries A and B (he said it is plural so it became masculine as country B’s friend is a guy).

He is not worryingly jealous or controlling, but he does like to know who I’m going out with and has confessed insecurities about me potentially cheating (I never have and don’t intend to, but this is our first LD relationship so some anxiety is understandable) especially since I’ve moved to a new country and live in a student residence with both men and women (like a giant house with private rooms and shared common rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, we are 40+ people living together in one house).

I find it hypocritical of him to have this stance and then simultaneously withhold information from me about this trip knowing that I would probably be uncomfortable about it. He swears that it just slipped his mind initially and that I had been busy in the couple of days between the conversations so he meant to bring it up to me when I wasn’t as busy (I find this to be bullshit, as we had at least one conversation in the meantime about his trips and he also could’ve texted me).

A hotel/AirBnb would’ve been too expensive, he hasn’t seen her in years (they apparently texted occasionally over the years but nothing excessive, and he has never given me cause for concern before (he’s had other women friends before and works in an industry with lots of women so I have never been worried before. Maybe a little anxious at the beginning of the relationship as LD isn’t easy) but I have trusted and believed/believe him to be faithful. I still don’t think he has/wanted to or was going to cheat on this trip anyway, it’s more the fact that he sidn’t tell me immediately and run it by me to see how I felt.

Another thing that irirtates me is that he will stay in her studio flat in student accommodation, so they will sleep in the same room together (him on an air mattress). If he were sleeping in a separate guest room or living room I would not have minded nearly as much.

This all happened over two weeks ago and he is now on day 2/3 of the trip to country A. He is coming to visit me in country C on Thursday 20.11.25 as he ultimately decided against country B (he said he wanted to see me sooner, and he has already visited country B so he also wanted to save money).

He has apologised several times for this when we first spoke about it a couple weeks ago, and he acknowledged where he went wrong in not telling me and has promised not to do it again, but I can’t shake this horrible feeling.

I can’t tell him not to come (tickets already booked) and I do want to see him, but I am still so irritated/icked out by this whole situation that I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to ruin the trip or be intimate with him when I’m angry. I thought I had gotten over it after about a week but now he’s there I’m becoming irritated and aloof again. I’m aware this isn’t very mature.

Do I sound crazy? Am I overreacting/dragging this out after two weeks and having already discussed the issue? I spoke to my best friend and her and her partner both validated my feelings and agreed that what he did wasn’t cool but also that it isn’t the end of the world (he’s hasn’t, didn’t and wouldn’t cheat so I don’t need to worry) but now that he’s coming in a couple days I don’t know what to do or how to feel.

If I am being crazy, please tell me. If not, please help me figure out how to get over this and how to approach this trip. I love him as my partner and like him as a person, and I don’t want damage what we have when there’s a way to work on myself or work together to fix it and make our relationship stronger.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

But I dare say I fucked myself over real good, and just the thought of this girl has made it hard to sleep for the last 5 weeks.


So ig to start off met a girl back in January, things were going what I thought were really good. Graduated high-school, got in the national guard (got a ship date) and decided to hold back on my first year of college, mostly to leave for college with her and also to get situated with the guard (I have more than enough in scholarships to get a full degree so I'm not serving with the guard just for college money.) So yeah I was planning to spend my winter to get in shape and spend as much time as I can with this girl before I ship. To put shortly I dropped pretty much everything I could to spend my winter with her.


Well well well October swings around, I was absolutely not regretting my decisions and she was like hey would you want to propose before you leave for BMT. I was absolutely ready and spent the next week very tentatively looking at rings and considering to ask her parents for he hand ect. Wellllll I quite accidentally hurt her feelings the next week, nothing major, we'd been worse before and I fucking get the ""hey we need to talk"". Got some complete bullshit reasons following ""were going to different schools, I've been thinking about this for a while and my parents say it's for the best"". So yeah that fucking sucked and thinking on it my train of thought was what it the actual fuck were these reasons. I told her I would need to be in a specific city if I a certain job due to recall time, but until then I could go to either that city or the school she's at until I got that Qual and needed to transfer schools. 2nd to that I'm actually on pretty damn good terms with her parents, i interact with her family alot outside of my relationship with this girl, so I have no clue where that came from. And my 3rd wtf was you just asked me to ""FUCKING PROPOSE"".


I reached out to her parents the next week just to make sure I was on good terms with them and just to let them know I have actually no clue what's going on with their daughter (she does live with them but she has in the past cut herself pretty damn deep and more recent has been doing random self piercings) As I said I interact with her family alot outside of my ex so i was making sure that I could still approach them since interaction is unavoidable. 


Anywho ig they spurred her to meet with me and explain herself better. So I did (I infact do regret, but atleast it was better closure, kinda) accused me of being weird and creepy for talking with her parents, doubled down on the distance and said being with me was causing to much stress on her college (her own damn fault for staying up late watching tv till 2 for the weeks leading up to mid terms, my text goodnight was always 10 or 11sih). Ooo and to ice it off fucken said that it was her late night self that asked us to get very serious and quite conveniently forgot all of our conversations about schools, futures, the times she asked to stay my girl in college and me telling her the various things I dropped, stopped doing, deleyed, and chose to be with her. Including being a Guardsman (I'd be active duty rn if it wasnt for her) All she wanted to do was tell me how I wasn't meant for her and anytime I spoke it was suddenly getting close to her needing to leave. Yeah so fuck her, not the point of the vent.

So yeah I'm now stuck in a shitty small city, am land locked, it's fucken rain and ice land part of alaska  (where's the sun),  all of my friends are gone to college. My job was seasonal so that's over. The goverment shut fucked any extra cash I would have needed to do any kind of travel and more than likely ruined any chance of a accelerated ship. No one worth while wants to hire me since I'd be gone and not returning by the time im trained up. So yeah suddenly left with no social network, with no chance of it, no way out other than shipping. All in the middle of fucken winter in honestly the worst city I've ever lived in. Yeah kinda got myself in a real good spot fml. All I can do is lift weights and just waste time till march. 

Low-key cannot even start to fathom how much I how much time I wasted on this childish acting bitch. I spent so much time doing the things she liked, building relationships with her family, money spent on meals and coffee. The countless time I went out of my way to take time off, skip events just to be at things important to her. For what for her to hardly interact with my family. Barely attend things important to me. I made the mistake of letting her be my +1 at my work party. She fucken sat in the same spot for 6 fucken hours and made me get her food and engage with her instead of being sociable and meeting close co workers. She fucken worked all day and came over just to sleep on the couch on my birthday instead of her taking the day off to spend together like we discussed weeks leading up. I should have honestly seen how much I gave for her and how little she gave back a long time ago.

Then, this is probably gonna piss someone off idgaf. She was one of those Christians that claims to be ultra faithful. But honestly I remember her using her ""faith"" to fucken insult me and take no accountability. Told me she ""has to marry another Christian"" and yet went out of her fucking way all the time to say I'm going to marry you, ooo let's get promise rings (a whole other fight cause I didn't want to get shut up rings) yet couldn't be accepting when I told her honestly I'm not religious. Nothing against your faith but I'm just not. To be fair I have my gripes and personally I'm not a big fan. Always been the odd kid out just because I said I don't believe in God. And genuinely not a fan of the people who went out of their way to make a fucken 8 yr old feel like a outcast because I wasn't their faith. Anyways I was willing to try it for her at my own speed but no. This bitch had to push and push. Then while I was out of city for 2 weeks she thought it was a good time to tell me every single damn day about how all of her co workers hit on her constantly and how she didn't like it. And when I told her to tell them to stop she would agree she needed to and give me every fucking excuse not to like ""I don't want to hurt their feelings or make the work place awkward."" Or my personal favorite excuse she made about saying no and to leave her alone to one guy ""he's a fellow Christian so it kinda goes against it"". Yep my reaction was pretty much what does that have to do with anything. He's hitting on a taken woman, tell that bitch to fuck off. 


Yeah.... looking back I should have dumped her when she said that. I feel pretty used and blind in the end here. Ya know the times were good and I did really love her and the time I spent with her but oh boy was that NOT worth it. Ig I have learned something. I can overlook alot of bs for a good pair of tits. Something along those lines.

1p0be5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1p0be5r/i_dont_agree_with_my_church_and_feel_unwelcome_is/,I don't agree with my Church and feel unwelcome. Is it time to look elsewhere? (Advice needed),"Hi all, 

I've been a part of my Chuch for a few years now, and in those years, there've been ups and downs,and I'm starting to ask the question of whether I should stay.   
  
So a bit on my Church: My Church is a more charismatic (non-denominational) church and believes in Adult Baptism, Female Pastors and (although not made very public) is into speaking in tongues (I agree with other human languages, just unsure about the ""private Godly language) and being slain in the spirit.

 I love my church, and since my GF introduced me, it's been my spiritual hub. I've got great friends (some even asked me to MC their wedding) in the church, and I've worked with them on a lot of outreaches, so all in all, everything looks good.

  
That said, these days I've been diving more into scripture, and I've realised that some of their teachings don't really match my interpretation of scripture. I will admit I come from a more conservative background, and I am quite frankly scared that this background may impair my judgment of the Church and its teachings.

  
Recently, there have been 3 incidents that have really caught my eye, and I'm unsure what to make of them. The first was after normal worship for our Sunday evening service, the Worship leader told us to ""sing our own song"", and it mimicked the likes of David Herzhog a lot with how it sounded. 

The second incident actually occurred over a few months, where our youth-pastor explained to me and my GF multiple times that ""speaking in tongues"" was the next step in our Relationship with God, and although he didn't say it was needed for salvation, he put a lot of emphasis on it being ""the next big thing.""

The third and last concern is something that happened today. Long story short, I'm part of a program where they walk you through what it means to truly be a follower of Christ. It's a 12-week program (we're in week 7), and the same youth group leader from earlier is the head of my small group as well.

  
A month ago, I informed the YL (youth leader) that because of my exams, I would have to miss 2 weeks' sessions (1 each week), but that I'm willing to catch up and work diligently to stay on par with the rest of the group. The first week, he wasn't very happy, but didn't say anything. Today, when I once again announced that I won't be attending, I got a call from him saying that my studies could ""take a break"" and that I should be doing ""God's will"" and not my own will. He abruptly said he wants to ""have a coffee"" with me on Friday, basically being the equivalent of saying he wants to tell me how wrong I am.

Now, when a friend of mine, also in the group, said he couldn't make it today, suddenly our YL called the group and said that we should move it later tonight when everyone has free time. This all, unfortunately, isn't the first time I've had a falling out with YL, as last year I took a few months away after he claimed to know I wasn't in a good place in my relationship with God.

This all makes me struggle. My GF and I love the church (she's a bit more liberal than I am), I love doing outreaches with them, and I love the people, but quite frankly, I don't feel very welcome, heard, respected or doctrinally safe here anymore. My friend has also been thinking of exploring other options, and I help create graphics and run marketing for our Youth Group.

Random redditors, I don't know anymore. Any advice?

1p0bdnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1p0bdnb/a_wolf_amongst_them/,A Wolf Amongst Them,"Preamble:

 

\-Current Persona: Null Hollow

 

\-Previous Identity: Deimos Soma (Died exploring the underground)

 

\-Previous Life: Bellial ‘’Bell’’ Moeris (Transmigrated into Deimos)

  

\-Pathway: Chained; Sequence 7 Werewolf 

 

\-City: Thalassamor 

 

\-Faction: Abyssal Choir



\*\*\*



Null Hollow was having an unusually pleasant day. He hadn't been attacked by a monster in over a week and had enjoyed a perfectly good breakfast at the bakery next to his new apartment. His clothes were clean, his apartment dry, and he just got two new pairs of boots. Being a Werewolf was awful for maintaining good footwear.



The Abyssal Choir had not asked anything extreme of him lately and his hunting trips had gone well. Even the City of Thalassamor has been cooling off after the disaster that was the Tide of Flesh.



So, now Null Hollow was enjoying a rare leisurely day of shopping and relaxing while sipping some Kelp Coffee with Mushroom Creme.



Sitting on a bench, he looked at the dome and sighed. With the regeneration of a Werewolf, Null was no longer bandaged up like a mummy. In fact he had recently gotten a haircut and now actually looked like a distinguished gentleman instead of looking like a street bum.



He thought back on his many hunting trips to the underground tunnels and the Abyssal Chasm. Hunting as a Werewolf had brought him many insights to the nature of his Werewolf Potion and the Principles of the Sequence.



In the end it was all about Desires. 



A Prisoner knew how to trap and cage their Desires until it was the right moment to unleash them. A Lunatic knew how to weaponize their Desires to turn them into a singular focused goal that would drive you through the madness. Finally, now as a Werewolf, Null understood that you had to amplify and concentrate your Desires into their most distilled Primal Essence to understand your true nature and to be one with the beast within. 



“Oh, is that an Oarfish?” 



Null said as he saw a rather large long fish swimming over the dome that protected the city from the ocean above. 



“That species was symbolic of something, but I can't quite recall what it was.” Null thought out loud as he drank his coffee on the park bench.



It was then that the earthquake started.



\*\*\*



Chaos. 



Sea quakes were not that rare in Thalassamor. There were many volcanic vents in the nearby Abyss, so tectonic activity was not unheard of. But, this one felt different. Not only was it strong, it was lasting longer than average. 



People were panicking in the streets and it was for good reason. Looking up, Null tried to gauge the condition of the glass dome. If that were to break, millions of tons of water would annihilate everything inside the city before you could start a prayer.



Even a powerful Werewolf Beyonder like Null Hollow would be nothing against the impressive might of nature. His miraculous regeneration would be useless against such an onslaught. Even if he managed to survive the force somehow, he would perish underwater unable to breath in the salty depths.



Still, the dome was holding strong. Moving amongst the crowd like a wolf amongst sheep, Null headed to open ground to avoid any buildings that might collapse. It was then that he saw them, the Doors of Light.



Light was a premium resource in a city like Thalassamor. With no Sun or Moon, even the brightest of moments were dim in comparison to his old world. This was a place of bioluminescent creatures and gas lanterns. Pure unadulterated light was rare to see. 



Darkness surrounded Null like a cloak as he shielded himself from the luminescent display. The beast within felt an instinctive threat from the light. He almost let out a snarl, before he remembered that he was out in public. 



Stalking to a more secluded corner, he saw them come out of the glowing gates. Crowds of folks in strange clothes that seem to be escaping from some unseen calamity. 



“Invaders or maybe refugees?” Null thought. Unlike the majority of Thalassamor, Null knew that there were other cities somewhere in the world. He was a frequent member of the Fool's Gatherings Above the Gray Fog. Although he usually kept to himself in those meetings and never participated much, he had learned that there were people in two other cities. 



They always seemed so far away and inaccessible. Could this be them?



Should Null help these seemingly desperate people? Null has always kept a low profile. A lone wolf amongst monstrosities. But he knew full well how it felt to be displaced from home and country. At the same time, Null did not want to attract attention to himself. He was comfortable working in the shadows and doing something big in the open like this was not like him at all.



So he decided to do something covertly. From a nearby alleyway, as he was cloaked in shadows, he unleashed a powerful Werewolf howl. It causes fright on the masses making the weak willed to back off from the doors of light and give the refugees space. 



With that he changes location. To keep from being spotted. At the end of the day he just observes without interacting with the newcomers.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

My ""stats"" are 5'10"" and 170lbs. I'm a highly motivated person, constantly striving for improvement and challenging my own beliefs. I've built a life I'm pretty proud of through, I work as a chemical operator, (a career btw that gives me the flexibility to stay in touch throughout the dayif that's your thing). When I'm not at work, I love running, going to the gym regularly, and playing with my pit/lab mix named Strider (yes, as in LOTR).

I'm a bit of a nerd, so fantasy is a huge thing for me—from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays. I visit the local renaissance fair (we should dress up!)so it would be cool if we could bond over that! I also love to travel, read history books, and try new restaurant/coffee shops, hanging with friends, and music festivals.

What I'm Looking For

I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the exact same hobbies, having the same goals and a similar future outlook is most important. I'm looking for a partner to share in the small, intimate moments that make a relationship special:

- Weekend cuddles and lazy mornings
- Evening coffee shop reading dates
- Random road trips and hitting the gym together
- Holding hands at the farmer’s market or snuggling in a hammock

I'm an inquisitive person, so I tend to ask a lot of questions. I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.

I’m open to long-distance relationships (in the US only), but my ultimate goal is for us to eventually move in together. Relocation to me is ideal.
If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you! I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have a slim/petite build or lean towards the athletic/fit side and ideally over 25 but not a deal breaker.

Since she isn't allowed to be as physically active because of her injuries (vet orders, also if she overexerts herself with physical exercise she has incontinence), we do lots and lots of mental work, such as sniffmats, lickymats, treats search also nose work (searching for pieces of Kong toy around the area or at home). We live on the outskirts of a small town in an apartment complex, just a step away from a large field and meadow areas, so she also gets enough free time to satisfy her hunting needs in smaller and shorter portions. She rarely pulls in this area, which includes all areas around the neighbourhood. 

But the second we step into a new environment (especially if taken by car) she tends to turn into a heavy train and sled pulling champion. She doesn't react to snacks or anything during this events and seems to be overexcited most of the time, walking from left to right and doesn't settle at all. This isn't a problem when I can have her off leash (very good recall) at least in the beginning, as she gradually calms down, but tends to be bothersome for me and painful for her when I have to have her leashed at all times, since (I'm assuming) she cannot spend the pent up adrenaline. I currently own a front clip harness (Ruffwear) but it seems it doesn't really do the job when she's pulling very hard. I don't want use the 8 figure lead or any collars, because she has hernia in her neck so it just provokes additional pain. 

I love her but this is creating a wedge in our relationship, because as much as I want to take her with me I just don't like her to tag along because of the pulling. I also don't think this behaviour is a consequence of pent up energy because she's not frustrated or bored and I really put a lot of time in her mental exercise to compensate for the physical part. She's a typical couch potato at home, she never destroyed anything in her life (but she steals socks and underwear like it's a national sport). She even sits with us and is calm in our local coffee shop. 

So now my question is for people with similar injuries or situations,.. how do you handle it and do you have any advice how handle this sled puller? Any tips/tricks?

1p0b8s5,https://i.redd.it/7bq43usqj02g1.jpeg,No pressure [breville express impress],"Forgive me if I forgot something; I did read the wiki and guide. I have a sort of dialing in question/return question. I picked out the breville express impress because it wasn’t as automatic as the digital ones so I felt less could go wrong; but I really like how it auto does the tamping and it self corrects. Thereby making it more or less fool proof. I know a lot of work goes into the perfect shot but I’m disappointed in this machine and not sure if maybe a home espresso machine just isn’t for me and I should toss in the towel? Here’s what I’ve done and my issues. 

I am getting only pre extraction pressure (but when testing with the rubber cleaning gasket I get full pressure). 

I use fresh roasted beans from a local coffee shop (roasted on October 29, 2025) and I’ve had their espresso and like it. 

I’ve tried various levels of grinding size and the highest pressure (see photo) is on the finest size

I read that dose size and all that affects it, but I got this machine because it helps me dial that in perfectly (supposedly) but it isn’t. 

It is a brand new machine. Less than two months old. I’m hesitant to check anything on the machine for warranty but also I realize that’s pointless because with the rubber cleaning gasket it’s fine. 

If I still have to do all this dialing in work for a machine that supposedly can do it for me (to a degree) I sort of want to just return it and buy a more basic model to save money. I don’t mind doing stuff myself. Or once I figure this out it will save and be easier. 

Thoughts? Help? 

I know you guys get questions from people wanting good espresso with no work; it’s not that I want that, I’m just semi annoyed at how this is advertised as such. ",0,1763470686.0,espresso,3,0.5,False

1p0b6dp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0b6dp,two days in Perugia for Eurochocolate,"Eurochocolate is among the biggest food festivals in Italy. it's been held in the centre of Perugia for thirty years, which might be too much for this fascinating little old town (1+ million of visitors each year, with hundreds of tourist buses coming by...). apart from big sponsors (like Perugina - eh, glad it's for free, wouldn't give my money to Nestlé - Lindt and Ritter), the festival displays most of the popular chocolate makers of Italy, ranging from Domori to Bonajuto, Ciomod, Majani, Ciokarrua, Vannucci, and so on. the products are your usual findings: chocolate barks, dragées, flavoured bars, crêpes.


but it doesn't stop there - a smaller corner called ""Eurochocolate World"" hosts a few high-quality tree-to-bar makers from Central and South America. it was such a pleasure to talk to them! Kairi is especially good - as you can read on the wrapper, the woman behind it curates the processing starting from the very pollination stage!! sounds absolutely insane to me. the chocolate is also super mellow and round, intense floral notes that complement its texture. a wonderful purchase


Cacao Mae held a little class with coffee pairing - both sourced from Dominican Republic. I'm not huge on high-roast coffee, but the fruity notes were note-worthy, and we were also gifted a small single serve bag for moka/espresso. the guy behind Cacao Mae sells a drinking chocolate mix (w/spices) inspired by his mother's recipe, so sweet. had to buy a bag of nibs from him. you're used to think nibs for cooking are all the same... well that's not true at all


Likkle More from Jamaica produces both flavoured and dark chocolate bars. it's really cool that the surface is decorated with coloured cocoa butter, to make it look like a palette. creative and unusual. her three single origin bars (among these, Bachelor's Hall estate - try Pump Street's version if you haven't) are very diverse - straight fruity, very nutty and mellow. the lady really cares about showing how different cacao might taste from an estate to another, as she offers you her whole range to try.


last but not least - the two single-origin chocolate classes. the first one focused on Arauca, with very insightful remarks on the commercial history of cacao in Colombia. it's a shame I didn't really like the chocolates... two out of four had unpleasant, almost stale notes:/ still a super interesting meeting. the latter focused on Venezuela as a whole, telling the story of how Criollo was (re)discovered only recently, how geography shapes  genetical diversity, and the up-and-coming schools of chocolatiers for the inner market. the three chocolates we tried were, of course, insanely rich and milky. not as complex as other Criollo darks like Domori, but nevertheless GOOD. had to skip the rhum pairing as I don't drink


the four other buyings come from an all tree-to-bar selling point. curious about the Costa Rican 70%! Soklet's is my first toasted white chocolate, I like it way better than expected (mostly because the saffron aroma is not so intense - looking at you, Standout Chocolate)",3,1763470500.0,chocolate,0,0.8,False

I am trying to give it my all but wondering if I am becoming a doormat. We come to blows about his female friend and have done for a long time. He keeps lying to me and I feel so lost. I don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone else been in similar situation, what did they do?


For those wanting to read, this is long.
We have been together for 12 years, married 6. Two children, 18m & 3yo. Background;
My husband forms friendships with women. I have, in the past, struggled with this as he normally has one close female friend. The first close female friendship that I struggled with, began just before we were married - Hayley. They worked together, would text all the time, late night texts, phone one another, lunch together. They would go on work nights out to drink together. He was her support when she struggled through IVF. They were very close and I will hands down admit I had jealousy issues and we would often argue about it. Things turned for me about 12 months into their friendship. I didn't feel so insecure as they seemend less intense. I finally met her. We went to their wedding, she once or twice came to the house.

When I was 8 months pregnant with my second, he began mentioning a new girl in work. Let's call her Mary. I didn't think much of it, he would bring her up when talking about work. Fast forward 4 months and he starts coming home smelling of smoke. I ask him if he's smoking as we are both ex smokers. I tell him I don't mind, just not to do it around the kids. He adamantly denies it. Happens again, denies it. I'm using his phone for something and a message previews from Mary. Something like ""no problem just make sure you put the lighter back"".
About the same time he meets Hayley for coffee. He comes back and seems fine, I'm out the house for a few hours, I come back and he suddenly pulls me aside. During their meet up Hayley said she heard a rumour in work that there's something between him and Mary. He knows who started the rumour, its malicious, false and he wants to tell me in case I somehow found out. We talk a bit, I'm not friends with anyone from his work so I don't see how the info would get to me. He asks if I don't believe him. So I ask him again about the smoking and he denies it. I tell him that I know he's lying and when I ask why, he says it's because he thought that I would be mad. He only smokes with Mary and she gives him cigarettes whilst they lunch together in the park. 
Once or twice in the 12 years he has lied but they've been minor things but I don't get the smoking one. It all escalates into full out arguments and coldness for a few weeks. I tell him I wanted to go to marriage counselling. He agrees and we go between July 24 to Feb 25. Lots comes out in it, about how he's unhappy with the marriage, with the way we live, with how I am. I raise I'm unhappy with his lying and I struggle with how intense his friendships get. Marriage counsellor suggests working on compromise with some things and setting boundaries, spending time together, ways to help our communication. She also suggest 1:1 therapy with her. We both do that, he attends two sessions and drops out. I finish the sessions as I go back to work in March 25.

We seemed to follow through on these things. I'd set my boundaries involving transparency and examples of what i think are appropriate interactions with women and he did the same for me. I ask him to keep his friendship with Mary to a work only basis. Around April time he starts to go out with a group of friends including Mary. They go out once or twice a month drinking. He starts to act a bit differently, less involved at home. Irritated with the kids and snappy. I organise all the family stuff. I feel like I am solo.

August 25; one day I take the kids for a day trip to the beach, he doesn't want to come and says he's worn out. When I get back he seems a bit odd. He tells me he didn't get up till the afternoon then watches TV. Over the next few days I feel something off. I very wrongly snoop his messages and I see that he's messaging Mary. Nothing untoward but frequent and the day I took the kids to the beach he was on a call with her for nearly 3 hours. 
I sit down and calmly tell him that I know he's been calling and messaging. 
He tells me he enjoys her company, she's a really good friend. They're just friends, I'm being irrational and he's allowed to have friends. He doesn't want to end the friendship as I will just act the same again in the future with another female friend.
We have some big arguments followed by us both saying we are unhappy and we want things to change. I want him to stop messaging her, he agrees. I said I was sorry for going through his messages and I would stop. We both agree to trying to make some time together and putting in 100% but we don't. 2 weeks later he breaks his ankle and is in cast for several weeks at home all day. It's hard, I have to do everything for the kids/house and I was probably a bit glum. He says halfway through he can't not text her. 
I realise I am being controlling by saying he can't text someone. It's not a boundary, I was wrong to do that and that I just want him to be involved with us and the kids. He promises me that he won't text when we are spending time together. 

October 25: He's down and moody, doesn't want to seem involved again. We have a big argument about it but it doesn't get fixed. I go off to meet some friends and he calls me and says hes out of work late. I pick up the kids after meeting friends and he's clearly anxious when I get home. Tells me he needs to speak to me now. Says he wasn't at work late but talking to Mary. After hearing all the words come out talking to Mary about how messed up we are he says he doesn't know if we can be together any more. I'm hurt and angry. About him lying, talking to Mary about our problems, how he's been disconnected again. She apparently didn't weigh in, he said because she's RC faith they don't divorce. I tell him to think about what he wants. I have always wanted to fix our marriage. I tell him I am going to spend the next few days separate from him and he can move out if he wishes. 

The next day during work, he calls me, frantic and says he's made a mistake. He loves me and doesn't want to lose what he has. He says he feels like life is shit but losing me will make it worse, he can't picture life without me. He's spoken to Mary who got angry at him and told him to go and fix his marriage and not to talk to her as clearly it was messing our marriage up. He got upset so work are sending him home and he wants to talk. 
He comes back, we talk, I agree that I want things to work. We both agree on a plan. Each get an evening/ day off a week for our own time. Spend at least one night a week doing something fun together. Spend some time on weekends as a family. Talk more about if we are down/uncomfortable etc. See if we feel different after Christmas. I tell him I'm going to stay out of the house for a few days anyway, but will bring the kids home in an evening and he can have some time to think outside that. 

It actually went well. We talked more, did more. Mary still texts. She's abroad for a few weeks so they have been texting quite a lot. I was asking him about her, was she enjoying her trip, what was she doing etc. He showed me some of the pics she sent about food and nature reserves. He wasn't glued to his phone when we were playing with the kids or watching a show together. We set a date night and got child cover. A week ago, he seemed off for a few days. Asked him if he was OK, what was up, could I help? He said he felt unmotivated at work and in life, felt a bit down. Asked if it was the shit with us. No, I've been brilliant, couldn't ask for more from me. He's loving what we are becoming. We had a good chat about what he could do to help himself for his low mood. 

Last week we agree to watch a series we both fancy for our together night. About 10 minutes in and he is on his phone. I ignore it for a bit but after a while I ask him if he wants to watch it another time. He says he's just finishing up on a game but i can see whatsapp in the window reflection. I told him I could it. He puts it down and then tries to make small talk about the show. When it ends I ask if it is Mary. He says yes. I ask him why he can't just stop for like 30 mins. He said he was just sending her a message saying he was going to bed. I got annoyed that he had lied, he got really annoyed and mad. He said it just keeps fucking up, whats the point. Cue a huge discussion where I point out that he could have text later, he could have left it on read for like 30 mins but that's not the problem, it was the lie. He said he knew I would be annoyed at the messaging but I point out I hadn't been and I was pissed about the lie and why does he always feel the need to lie. If I can't trust about small things then what about big things.

Next day he apologises and says he's a dick and he's seen such a difference in us the last 3 weeks. He feels like things are on the right track. I feel numb. He's carrying on like we were beforehand. Affectionate, laughing, being good with the kids. Proper talk between us. We are meant to be going out together soon. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I have definitely created a toxic environment for us and I am desperately trying to reverse that. I feel as though I am genuinely giving it my all but I don't know if I am going to get hurt by this. I feel OK about them being friends and then he lies and I wonder why the need to lie. Is it what I've caused, is it something else. I have thought about a split many times but I love what we have had over the years and know it can be so much better. I can't afford therapy, I don't dare talk to family or friends. I can't give 100% and also ""get my ducks in a row"" I'm not that kind of person. I don't know what to do",2,1763470123.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p0apwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/1p0apwn/three_weeks_post_surgery/,Three weeks post surgery,"Greetings from the great state of Florida!

This morning marks three weeks since I had surgery and it feels like it’s been a strange, but good, trip. Here a few notes on what led me to where I am.

Age 64. Diagnosed in May with two 3+4 and three 3+3. PSA was 6. Very healthy and active…gym x3 per week, golf almost every day, ride big motorcycles, former Ironman triathlete.

PSMA PET Scan showed everything confined to prostate. Good news!

The 3+4 meant that I needed to do something. Obviously my first advice came from surgeon and he explained the pros and cons of his trade. Refered to MD Anderson for radiation consult. Radiologist went through his courses of treatment. His honest opinion was that I should probably do surgery…I hated the idea of hormone therapy that comes with radiation.

It seemed to me that with radiation there is no definitive point at which they can say they nipped it. I am sure that I may be naive on this, but with surgery it is out of the body and the follow up pathology can give a definitive answer on margins and surrounding tissue. I chose to not have lymph nodes touched. Since all indication was containment to prostate I rolled the dice. if it is in the lymph nodes it will show up on PSA in a couple months and we’ll deal with it. If not, I have saved side effects of loosing the nodes.

So…I opted for surgery. As a retired Marine I do medical through a Naval hospital. As those docs generally deal with a younger population PC is not a common thing they deal with. I had immediate trust in the Navy commander treating me. He has done approximately 30 RALP surgeries…I read about people looking for surgeons who have 500+ under their belt. Glad I trusted the man working on me.

Surgery came and went. Woke up with no pain. My only bad experience was the catheter. He wanted it in for two weeks. The last couple days sucked, but I made it through.

Post catheter was a mess. 0% ability to hold pee the first day. Day after cath removal I had pelvic floor PT. Six days later I’m at about 90% dry. Some of my leaking is self inflicted…in my search for return to normal I refuse to give up my coffee in the morning. I will clean up the mess in order to watch the sun rise in the backyard with a hot cup of Joe…and my Boykin Spaniel’s by my side.

ED was a big concern, obviously. I was unique in that I started to get hard even with cath in. strange but comforting. Doc prescribed Viagra and started taking it yesterday. Didn’t know what to expect…but in about 10 minutes I had a full errection.

So…in summary… still have a lot of apprehension about the future and still hope surgery was the right choice. I’m fully aware that set backs are gonna happen.

Like everyone, I made the best decision I could and trusted the process. The experiences people share on here guided, comforted, and reassured me all along the way. This affliction will always be with me, but it is DAng manageable.

May God be with us. Thanks to all y’all who take the time on this page to support others!",11,1763469170.0,ProstateCancer,5,1.0,False

1p0aphp,https://www.reddit.com/r/RayNeo/comments/1p0aphp/rayneo_x3_pro_a_critical_look_at_the_features/,"RayNeo X3 Pro: A Critical Look at the Features, Competitors, and Core Concerns","Hey r/augmentedreality, r/Technology, r/gadgets and fellow AR enthusiasts,

Like many of you, I've been following the AR space with intense interest, waiting for a device that truly delivers on the promise of a seamless, powerful, and practical augmented reality experience. The RayNeo X3 Pro announcement has captured my attention because it seems to be tackling some of the biggest hurdles that have held back consumer AR.

As part of my application to become a beta tester, I've been asked to share my analysis. I want to break down what excites me, where I see it stacking up against the competition, and the tough questions I believe need to be answered.

# The Specific Features I’m Most Excited to Test (And Why They Matter for the AR Market)

For me, the potential of the X3 Pro lies in three key areas that could represent a major leap forward for the entire industry:

**1. Standalone Processing (Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1):** This is, without a doubt, the most critical feature. The move to a powerful, on-device processor is the difference between AR glasses being a phone accessory and becoming a true computing platform. Why this matters: It has the potential to solve the latency issues that plague cloud-dependent devices, enhance user privacy by keeping data local, and enable robust functionality even when offline. If this architecture works as advertised, it could set a new standard, forcing the market to shift away from tethered solutions and toward truly independent, mobile AR.

**2. True Binocular, High-Brightness Display:** A bright, full-color MicroLED display for each eye is fundamental for genuine AR. While monocular displays like the Meta Display are great for notifications, they can't provide the depth perception needed for truly immersive and interactive 3D content. Why this matters: This is the technology that unlocks professional use cases visualizing architectural models, providing surgical overlays, or guiding complex assembly. For the consumer market, it means more believable navigation and more engaging AR games and experiences. I'm eager to test how the 6,000-nit brightness holds up in direct sunlight, a common failure point for many current displays.

**3. Full SLAM for Spatial Computing:** The inclusion of a dual-camera system and depth sensors for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is what separates a heads-up display from a true spatial computer. Why this matters: This is the foundational technology that allows the glasses to understand a user's environment. It enables persistent AR objects (placing a virtual TV on a wall and having it stay there) and intuitive gesture controls. The success of the entire AR app ecosystem hinges on the reliability and accuracy of SLAM. A robust implementation here could finally unlock the ""killer apps"" that the industry has been waiting for.

# A Critical Comparison: The X3 Pro vs. Meta Display and Even G2

The X3 Pro isn't entering an empty market. It’s positioning itself in a fascinating middle ground between two very different philosophies:

|Feature|**RayNeo X3 Pro**|**Meta Ray-Ban Display**|**Even Realities G2**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Display**|Binocular, Color MicroLED (6000 nits)|Monocular, Color (5000 nits)|Monocular, Micro-LED (1000 nits)|
|**Processing**|Standalone (Snapdragon AR1)|Phone/Cloud Dependent|Phone Dependent|
|**Camera**|Yes (Dual, with Depth)|Yes (Single)|No Camera|
|**Spatial Computing**|Yes (SLAM)|No|No|
|**Control**|Gestures, Voice, Touchpad|EMG Wristband, Voice, Touchpad|Smart Ring, Temple Taps|
|**Battery**|TBD (Concerns exist)|\~6 hours|\~2 days|
|**Philosophy**|**Full AR Power**|**Social Capture & Notifications**|**Subtle, All-Day Information**|

This comparison shows the trade-offs. The Meta Display is a polished accessory for the Meta ecosystem, prioritizing social sharing and notifications over immersive AR. The Even G2 makes a bold bet on social acceptance and all-day wearability by removing the camera, but in doing so, it sacrifices all ahot at advanced AR.

The RayNeo X3 Pro is the only one of the three that is unapologetically aiming to be a powerful, all-in-one AR device. It embraces the complexity and the challenges, and that ambition is exactly what leads to my most pressing questions.

# My Core Questions and Concerns for Beta Testing

A great device isn't just about great specs; it's about solving real-world problems and being practical for daily use. As a beta tester, my feedback would be focused on these critical, make-or-break issues:

**1. The Battery Life Reality:** This is my number one concern. Early reports have raised red flags. My testing would be methodical: What is the real-world battery drain with SLAM-powered navigation running for 30 minutes? How many minutes of a video call can it handle before hitting the 10% low-power threshold? If the device can't be used for its key features for a reasonable amount of time, the ""standalone"" promise is broken.

**2. Thermal Management:** Physics is a harsh mistress. A powerful processor and bright displays generate heat. I would test for thermal throttling and user comfort during extended use. Does it get uncomfortably warm on the temples after 20 minutes of running an AR application? This is a crucial factor for wearability.

**3. A Fundamental Accessibility Issue:** Prescription Lenses. This is a glaring omission in all the marketing materials. As someone who requires vision correction, this isn't a minor detail it's a dealbreaker. The complete silence on whether the X3 Pro supports prescription inserts or custom lenses is a major concern. It makes me question how focused the design team is on the needs of a huge segment of potential users. This would be one of my first and most persistent points of feedback.

**4. The Social Contract:** The design is sleek, but a visible camera still carries social implications. I would be keen to test how people react in different environments from a professional meeting to a casual coffee shop. Can it be used discreetly, or does it create a sense of unease in those around you? Proving that it can be a socially acceptable device is a huge hurdle for any AR glasses with a camera.

I believe the RayNeo X3 Pro has the potential to be a pivotal device for the AR industry. It's making the right bets on technology, but its success will depend on solving these very real, very practical challenges. I'm excited by the possibility of helping to find those solutions.

Super long post incoming but probably will find it cringe as a reader (Bias aside). Also Im not good with women so thats why I give as many details as possible to see if i misunderstood the situation at some point. Anyways i just want to get this out of my chest cuz im super disappointed.

Before I get crucified I know that not “all” women are like this but Ive seen/experienced many examples like this one before. For those of you who are actually genuine we “men” appreciate you 🙏. But Im genuinely confused and would love to hear what yall have to say, I welcome any criticism and feedback if you think I made the wrong move somewhere (:

Stories contain me (21yrs old) and these 2 girls whom i will call “R” (Shy) and “B” (More talkative) respectfully who are besties and have been flirting with me for weeks…

I will start from the beginning so you are fully informed before you judge, and list all the points with numbers where i think either of them flirted with me. Argument will get stronger as story goes on so dont judge solely from the early stages.

Story 1 might be a bit boring so skip to 4 and 5 but you wont get the full picture

Been working in a mall for a while now and there’s this coffee shop where R and B work. I’ve noticed R 1-2 months ago and immediately thought that she is absolutely stunning but didn’t want to make an immediate move, especially not while she is on-duty cuz i didnt want to put her in an awkward spot in case she wanted to reject me. As for B… Im simply not interested in her cuz i chose R right? Just want to get that out of the way. So i would go there get my coffee and suffer in silence cuz i didnt know how to approach her. Her beauty killed me to the point where i didn’t eat nor sleep. So I started praying to God and told him that this feeling is unbearable and asked him to send me a sign if it is meant to be.

Then i saw her on a Thursday night with one guy so i thought that she has a boyfriend and that i have no chance and this is my “No” from God but turns out he wasnt (Somebody told me 100% true). Anyways I was talking to my coworkers opposite of them and that guy but she kept looking at me for like 20 minutes… totally not interested in what the other guy was saying and probably drooled a bit haha. Then i left and suddenly they switched tables (Coincidence? Why switch?) On my way back she pretended to look at the phone but as i walked by she checked me out top to bottom, so then i did it again and SHE CHECKED ME TOP TO BOTTOM AGAIN but pretended like she didnt look at all.

Story 1:

Believe it or not next time I went R started asking “Oh your favourite again?” (This I know… it may not have been a flirt) then “So you are doing a lap again and will come back?” (I always did 1 lap around, how does she even know this?). Something sparked but i didnt take it too seriously cuz its part of their job.

Story2:

B comes into play here. Mind you B has NEVER EVER EVER looked at me before, never talked to me, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING before i started getting drinks from R. So one day R (turned with her back) and B (facing me) sit on one of the tables for hours. Every time I pass by (3-5 meters away) their table (part of my job) B checks me out but we dont make eye contact and R smirks and whispers something to her.

(I think this was a flirt)

When the crowd goes away B OUT OF NOWHERE yells “How was your day” aiming to get my attention obviously (SHE HAD NEVER TALKED TO ME BEFORE) so i go there and me and her have a little chitchat while R is listening staying sideways with me. B did not want me to go away and she tried to prolong the convo but I was forced to go eventually cuz of the supervisors.

In this brief moment R was serious and I turned my back for a split second but as I turned back again to  face them i saw her jump a little while making some gestures (You know like when girls have a crush on someone that type of gesture) with her hands and also laughing but immediately stopped when she noticed that i saw her do that and turned her back again (Surely they were talking about me before that? Sitting there when there are a billion other cafes? Why my area? B was checking me out every time i passed too. AND INITIATES CONVERSATION OUT OF NOWHERE??)

But lets say they didnt check me out and they were laughing about something else and im totally overthinking + biased just because i liked her.

Story 3:

Same day as story 2 but now R and B left (Or thats what i thought) Im done with my shift just before the shops close and I go on the upper level to grab something on my way out when i saw R coming my way with another girl. No one else in the hall. We noticed each other from like 30m away and kept closing the gap, when we got to the passing point she gave me THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLIRTATIOUS SMILE IVE EVER SEEN THEN RAISED HER EYES AND BIT HER LIPS. IT FELT LIKE A DREAM. That smile when you want to say “I want you so bad” it was that type of smile. She caught me off guard and i smiled back at her just a bit but we didnt say a word. Why would she do that if she is not interested in me? Surely this is my green light to shoot my shot RIGHT????

Story 4:

Part 1

3-4 days go by and I hadnt seen either of them. Until I did. They both popped up, this time R working and B sitting on bar for hours again… waiting for R to finish from work. No interaction between me and R while B does anything but sit straight any time i get near the shop (I could see her from distance but she couldnt see me). Crawling on the tables, twisting, stretching… anything to get my attention, and once i slowed down she would start rolling her eyes in a flirty way, playing with her hair, biting her lips bla bla. Now you may say “Oh she was just bored “ but you dont bite your lips any time someone comes and give them the “fuck me” look.

I found it funny for a bit but tried to play it as friendly as possible and just smiled a bit then found an excuse to leave every time since obviously i wasn’t interested in her. **But deep down i sensed something awkward incoming **

Part 2

Same day, couple of hours later. Shops close down and I just wait for the clock to run so i can go home and i noticed R and B leaving together. Nothing. Then half an hour later i see them coming down from the top hugging each other while i was drinking water COMPLETELY ISOLATED. We make eye contact and B waves at me, I was surprised so i waved back and then R tried to put her hand down. They started laughing loudly and got messy so they shoved each other in the door next to them therefore we didnt talk. ** Why the hell would they wave and laugh if NEITHER is interested in me?

Story 5 and PLOT TWIST

At this point i was tired. I was ready to ask her out but never saw her off-duty and didn’t want to do it while she is working cuz its gonna put her in an awkward spot in front of her boss.

So I promised myself to be patient and simply prayed that one day I somehow see her. I wrote down my number on a paper and carried it for days in my pockets hoping that some miracle happens. A week goes by and I started to lose hope, even my friend told me how do you wait for her to come out on her day off when she never does it? I started to lose hope and thought that this was the nail in the coffin from God and that i should move on.

10 minutes before my shift ends, shops completely empty. I see R and B eating by themselves in like 500 tables in the court. What are the odds??? THIS IS MY MOMENT. I grab the paper and approached them saying excuse me ladies but this is for your and i hand over the note to R. B immediately knew whats up and she GOT REALLY SOUR and DEAD SERIOUS.

B: Are you serious? Can i ask you something? How old r u? (Her tone was so serious, creeped out like im 53 and not 21)

Me: Im 21

B: Do you know how old she is?

Me: No

R: We are both 16

THIS BITCH CALLED B GAVE ME THE “I WANNA PULL YOUR PANTS DOWN” LOOK FOR DAYS AND NOW HAS THE AUDACITY TO BE WORRIED THAT IM TOO OLD???????????!!?!?!!!!

At that point i wanted to die on the spot i swear. I got so embarrassed. THEY WERE 16????? NO WAY BOTH OF THEM LOOK 18-20 WHAAAAAT. I stuttered and didnt know what to say. I barely mumbled “Im really sorry i didnt know that, throw the note in the bin” and immediately left. Then on my way out i stopped again and said “im so sorry” and left for good.

Conclusion

Im really embarrassed. This is such an awful day. After months of praying and pain everything falls into pieces just when i thought I made it. Now i feel like R is going to spread the word and completely ruin my reputation everywhere… I will be seen as a creep or a pedo. My apologies didnt seem to affect her and im trembling right now.

Now back to the main topic. Why did they flirt with me if they were not interested?

Background: I didn't plan on transferring when I first bought the tickets. An alliance member gave me the idea when he asked how much it was because it reduced his alliance tokens by a large amount. If other people are buying it, maybe I should too? So I've been buying it every week - way before I read the advice that you should always have tickets reserved just in case a state changes overnight.

I had accumulated 11 tickets total. I only needed 6 for my main account (90M, FC2) and 5 tickets for my farm account (50M, F30).

**How I Chose a State**

I looked for a state that has castle rotation, compatible bear time and mainly uses English.

🏰 Castle Rotation - States that share the battle record with other alliances or capable of taking Sunfire Castle. It's a good sign there is a functional NAP in place and multiple alliances are allowed to grow to adequately compete with each other.

🐻 Bear Time - When the game was new, I could justify drinking coffee just to stay up late. However it was untenable over time and found myself moving to an earlier and earlier time slot. I decided that I need to find a state that was more compatible for gaming hours only.

🌎 Language - Communication is integral in the game and from playing in other states, it was easier when most people can communicate in English.

**The State I Transferred to**

I randomly asked state presidents or players what their bear time was. Then I asked other follow up questions about their NAP, requirements in their alliance, and if they have ordinary invites available.

The person I talked to in my new state was a green flag from first chat. He didn't immediately say yes and deferred decision making to his team. He was also prompt in responding to messages. Transparent when there were hiccups. And worked well with another alliance during the recruitment phase. They coordinated with me right before phase 2 opened and sent the invitation immediately after reset. They gave off a reliable and professional first impression.

\---

There were a few weird omens before I joined. Like when I created an account in this state, it warned me that not many people speak in my language. I made a lot of characters in other states and this was the first time I encountered this pop up message.

And a few hours before transferring, I got a war declaration. My alt-account, a level 7 castle with 0 RSS was attacked.

\---

I scouted this state before joining. And like every other there are problems, but I appreciated that I knew about it just from reading their world chat. But what I liked the most about this state is that their people are passionate, sweet and good sports. During SVS week, one player was willing to do everything for his state. And right before transfer, they reached an agreement to behave well for new people joining in.

https://preview.redd.it/5h9i4eyfa02g1.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1df65ff0a53487d3ac85e4f595e9d30426d94b

They also had a pretty wholesome interaction with their SVS opponent who said:

It was pretty cool to see opposing sides with a similar perspective about the game and had mutual respect for each other. I like the idea that WOS didn't have to be a war game, but played like any other sport where strategy and skill take center stage.

They lost SVS prep but they reached 4 billion points. They scored higher than other winning states I observed. The opposing state crushed it, with a final score of around 4.7B.

After transferring I learned that alliance leaders and whales practice what they preach when they remind people to save for SVS. The events leader board is filled with random players, that even people from small alliances can rank in top 100. I wasn't really looking for a SVS focused state but they seem pretty determined for a win. Luckily, I like a good underdog story.

It's only been a week since I transferred and it's probably too early to make a complete review. But I think it's safe to say that this state has potential and its population is what makes it special.

Overall, I had a pretty smooth transfer experience.",4,1763468525.0,whiteoutsurvival,1,0.84,False

From day one she has been so cold towards me, here are a few things she’s done:
1. Told me that she reported back to other female coworkers that I’m “normal” and not to worry about me being weird (this happened in the first week of being there, and is so random to even think that’s a normal thing to say to someone)
2. Told me that people usually get fired after 6 months (which I think was a ploy to scare me)
3. Went to a work function in my first week and told me beforehand that I was not allowed to “stick” to her or another colleague the whole night and to leave her alone
4. Told me I couldn’t listen to a group conversation and pulled everyone away from me to talk to them
5. She did not train me in anything for about 3 weeks and when I asked her how to do a task she told me “I’m not the boss of *insert task*”
6. Does not CC in any emails (which was hard because I was meant to be taking over her workload and had no knowledge of running tasks) and told me I must continue to CC her in emails even though she isn’t working on those tasks anymore 
7. Hadn’t invited me to meetings 
8. She also told me that nobody in the office will want to speak to me unless I make an effort first. So I tried to make an effort with everyone at the work event mentioned previously and she honestly made me feel so bad about myself that I began to think everyone hates me. 

I guess I’m just confused on why she acts like this. She framed herself as cold to people, which made me feel like she thought I had to gain her “friendliness” or “respect”. She’s very close with everyone else in our office and chatty etc. inviting them to coffees and skipping me. She was meant to guide me through my first few months here and be a mentor but I genuinely feel like she wants me to fail. I guess I’m wondering how do I navigate this?

TLDR: female coworker constantly wants me to fail and is bluntly rude to me, even though she was appointed to guide me through my first few months at my new job.

Super long post incoming but probably will find it cringe as a reader (Bias aside). Also Im not good with women so thats why I give as many details as possible to see if i misunderstood the situation at some point. 
Anyways i just want to get this out of my chest cuz im super disappointed.

Before I get crucified I know that not “all” women are like this but Ive seen/experienced many examples like this one before. For those of you who are actually genuine we “men” appreciate you 🙏. But Im genuinely confused and would love to hear what yall have to say, I welcome any criticism and feedback if you think I made the wrong move somewhere (:

Stories contain me (21yrs old) and these 2 girls whom i will call “R” (Shy) and “B” (More talkative) respectfully who are besties and have been flirting with me for weeks… 

I will start from the beginning so you are fully informed before you judge, and list all the points with numbers where i think either of them flirted with me. Argument will get stronger as story goes on so dont judge solely from the early stages. 

**Story 1 might be a bit boring so skip to 4 and 5 but you wont get the full picture**

Been working in a mall for a while now and there’s this coffee shop where R and B work. I’ve noticed R 1-2 months ago and immediately thought that she is absolutely stunning but didn’t want to make an immediate move, especially not while she is on-duty cuz i didnt want to put her in an awkward spot in case she wanted to reject me. As for B… Im simply not interested in her cuz i chose R right? Just want to get that out of the way.
So i would go there get my coffee and suffer in silence cuz i didnt know how to approach her. Her beauty killed me to the point where i didn’t eat nor sleep. So I started praying to God and told him that this feeling is unbearable and asked him to send me a sign if it is meant to be.

Then i saw her on a Thursday night with one guy so i thought that she has a boyfriend and that i have no chance and this is my “No” from God but turns out he wasnt (Somebody told me 100% true). Anyways I was talking to my coworkers opposite of them and that guy but she kept looking at me for like 20 minutes… totally not interested in what the other guy was saying and probably drooled a bit haha. Then i left and suddenly they switched tables **(Coincidence? Why switch?)** On my way back she pretended to look at the phone but as i walked by she checked me out top to bottom, so then i did it again and SHE CHECKED ME TOP TO BOTTOM AGAIN but pretended like she didnt look at all.

**Story 1:**

Believe it or not next time I went R started asking “Oh your favourite again?” (This I know… it may not have been a flirt) then “So you are doing a lap again and will come back?” (I always did 1 lap around, how does she even know this?). Something sparked but i didnt take it too seriously cuz its part of their job.

**Story2:**

B comes into play here. **Mind you B has NEVER EVER EVER looked at me before, never talked to me, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING before i started getting drinks from R**. So one day R (turned with her back) and B (facing me) sit on one of the tables for hours. Every time I pass by (3-5 meters away) their table (part of my job) B checks me out but we dont make eye contact and R smirks and whispers something to her.

(I think this was a flirt) 

When the crowd goes away B OUT OF NOWHERE yells “How was your day” aiming to get my attention obviously (SHE HAD NEVER TALKED TO ME BEFORE) so i go there and me and her have a little chitchat while R is listening staying sideways with me. B did not want me to go away and she tried to prolong the convo but I was forced to go eventually cuz of the supervisors.

In this brief moment R was serious and I turned my back for a split second but as I turned back again to  face them i saw her jump a little while making some gestures (You know like when girls have a crush on someone that type of gesture) with her hands and also laughing but immediately stopped when she noticed that i saw her do that and turned her back again **(Surely they were talking about me before that? Sitting there when there are a billion other cafes? Why my area? B was checking me out every time i passed too. AND INITIATES CONVERSATION OUT OF NOWHERE??)**

**But lets say they didnt check me out and they were laughing about something else and im totally overthinking + biased just because i liked her.**

Story 3: 

Same day as story 2 but now R and B left (Or thats what i thought) Im done with my shift just before the shops close and I go on the upper level to grab something on my way out when i saw R coming my way with another girl. No one else in the hall. We noticed each other from like 30m away and kept closing the gap, when we got to the passing point she gave me THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLIRTATIOUS SMILE IVE EVER SEEN THEN RAISED HER EYES AND BIT HER LIPS. IT FELT LIKE A DREAM. That smile when you want to say “I want you so bad” it was that type of smile. She caught me off guard and i smiled back at her just a bit but we didnt say a word. 
**Why would she do that if she is not interested in me? Surely this is my green light to shoot my shot RIGHT????**

**Story 4:**

Part 1

3-4 days go by and I hadnt seen either of them. Until I did. They both popped up, this time R working and B sitting on bar for hours again… waiting for R to finish from work. No interaction between me and R while B does anything but sit straight any time i get near the shop (I could see her from distance but she couldnt see me). **Crawling on the tables, twisting, stretching… anything to get my attention, and once i slowed down she would start rolling her eyes in a flirty way, playing with her hair, biting her lips bla bla.** Now you may say “Oh she was just bored “ but you dont bite your lips any time someone comes and give them the “fuck me” look. 

I found it funny for a bit but tried to play it as friendly as possible and just smiled a bit then found an excuse to leave every time since obviously i wasn’t interested in her. **But deep down i sensed something awkward incoming **

Part 2

Same day, couple of hours later. Shops close down and I just wait for the clock to run so i can go home and i noticed R and B leaving together. Nothing. Then half an hour later i see them coming down from the top hugging each other while i was drinking water COMPLETELY ISOLATED. We make eye contact and B waves at me, I was surprised so i waved back and then R tried to put her hand down. They started laughing loudly and got messy so they shoved each other in the door next to them therefore we didnt talk.
** Why the hell would they wave and laugh if NEITHER is interested in me?

**Story 5 and PLOT TWIST**

At this point i was tired. I was ready to ask her out but never saw her off-duty and didn’t want to do it while she is working cuz its gonna put her in an awkward spot in front of her boss. 

So I promised myself to be patient and simply prayed that one day I somehow see her. I wrote down my number on a paper and carried it for days in my pockets hoping that some miracle happens. A week goes by and I started to lose hope, even my friend told me how do you wait for her to come out on her day off when she never does it? I started to lose hope and thought that this was the nail in the coffin from God and that i should move on. 

10 minutes before my shift ends, shops completely empty. I see R and B eating by themselves in like 500 tables in the court. What are the odds??? THIS IS MY MOMENT. I grab the paper and approached them saying excuse me ladies but this is for your and i hand over the note to R. B immediately knew whats up and she GOT REALLY SOUR and DEAD SERIOUS. 

B: Are you serious? Can i ask you something? How old r u? (Her tone was so serious, creeped out like im 53 and not 21)

Me: Im 21

B: Do you know how old she is? 

Me: No

R: **We are both 16**

THIS BITCH CALLED B GAVE ME THE “I WANNA PULL YOUR PANTS DOWN” LOOK FOR DAYS AND NOW HAS THE AUDACITY TO BE WORRIED THAT IM TOO OLD???????????!!?!?!!!!

At that point i wanted to die on the spot i swear. I got so embarrassed. THEY WERE 16????? NO WAY BOTH OF THEM LOOK 18-20 WHAAAAAT. I stuttered and didnt know what to say. I barely mumbled “Im really sorry i didnt know that, throw the note in the bin” and immediately left. Then on my way out i stopped again and said “im so sorry” and left for good.

**Conclusion**

Im really embarrassed. This is such an awful day. After months of praying and pain everything falls into pieces just when i thought I made it. Now i feel like R is going to spread the word and completely ruin my reputation everywhere… I will be seen as a creep or a pedo. My apologies didnt seem to affect her and im trembling right now.

**Now back to the main topic. Why did they flirt with me if they were not interested?**

If you made it here… thank you for your time 🙏

Long story short we entered a hook up/casual relationship, but quickly it became her coming over for days and sleeping over and daily contact and what seemed like a “relationship”. I met her parents she asked me if I could fall in love with her and kept telling me how great I am. This lasted 3 months. Right after her birthday she received a gift basket from her ex and she showed me. I took it a sign of trust, but very quickly her energy changed and she became distant and would still come over and communicate thru text but no more intimacy (also starting birth control,so I excused it as hormonal changes) She went to Hawaii with her family and came back a different person, a week of hanging out few times but super distant like never before, I asked if she thought the birth control was messing up with her body. She lashed out and discarded me mind you a day after I lost my job, I was so emotional I begged and cried (not ashamed as she my first and I really cared for her) she had no expression. She told me it was final and we will never see each other again. She left 4 hours later text me to ask how I was feeling, I went nc right away a week later she texted me she wanted to talk about the breakup. We met for coffee she came extremely put together even wearing jewelry I bought her. She apologize and she she felt horrible how things end, but to add salt to my wound she told me she wasn’t ready for a relationship and offered me fwb because she wants me in her life, and that I was an awesome and fun person she still wanted to experience sex and adventures with me, but she wanted to enjoy her 20s and be free to date for experiences and maybe hook up with others too, she also told me after we broke up she went to see her ex “nothing happened “ just she needed soup, which her sister told me the day she asked her also if she could take her to get soup but she couldn’t. I was hurt and I said I would tried it out (to keep her in my life) but as soon as I got home I texted her that I wasn’t interested in that deal and wish her the best.
