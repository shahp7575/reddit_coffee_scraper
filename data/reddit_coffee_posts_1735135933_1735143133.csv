Hi everyone! I am a former barista at Caribou Coffee back in college (20yrs ago!) and my husband got me the Breville Bambino for Christmas! I immediately want to upgrade the accessories. I was looking at buying individual pieces but saw this for [$100]. What are your thoughts on this set? I like that it is all organized together. 

Do you think this is the route or would it be cheaper to buy the parts individually?

I already have a great scale and a top tier grinder is next. ",1,1735142900.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I gave one of them to my window guy as a Xmas gift and for doing a great job and I opened the other bottle on Xmas day to have with lunch. I sniffed the cork and thought it smelt a vinegary and had a quick taste and it was sour. I thought it might have been  because I just had my morning coffee so I left it to breathe and tasted it a couple of hours later but no, it was acidic and not pleasant like when I had it before.

From what I've read, a corked wine smells like wet cardboard, moldy etc. so is this not what one would describe as being corked? Would it just be called a ""bad"" bottle?

I'll be taking it back to my local wine shop to have it replaced, ai hope the one I gave away as a gift is ok.",1,1735142598.0,wine,2,1.0,False

I have seen young and old have a decent time. It's fun to see some come as couples, some alone, some for work, some just sit and read a book once in a while. 

It's a hectic but still cozy life.

However today I was cringing at this exchange between these three random people who probably never met and will never meet.

A young lad(?) was practically drooling at this one girl, who looked pretty good but was clearly dying to get the coffee and get back to her seat. 

I have never seen a face fake a smile and make a number on the spot this quick😭 and the moment he felt like he scored or something she looked like she could've barfed.

Worst is a random chick who has nothing to do with these two, looking at this exchange and cringing at them.

Apparently there was a prop check included in the envelope, with the amount written they thought her character would give, which I think is neat and perhaps indicative of the depth of their friendship.

I'll follow up soon with the answer as well as a little something Sarah Levy did in response to the check.

1hm376m,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafebrasil/comments/1hm376m/como_foi_a_sua_experiência_tentando_apresentar_um/,Como foi a sua experiência tentando apresentar um café gourmet ou especial para alguém?,"Em novembro eu fui para a casa do meu meio irmão, que é 30 anos mais velho que eu para passar uns dias.

Na primeira manhã lá, eu perguntei se ele e a esposa dele queriam experimentar o café que eu tinha levado. Era um café em grãos da Coffee++ e eu tinha levado o moedor e demais equipamentos necessários para preparar. Nada de muito luxo, mas bem melhor que o cafezão de mercado que eles costumam tomar.

Então eu separei grãos para preparar 300 mL de café para os dois, o que pra mim já é bastante café. Eles reclamaram da quantidade e acharam que eu estava economizando porque o café é caro. Então preparei mais 300 mL. Já estava com a mão doendo de tanto triturar café. Foram cerca de 50g.

Aí eu sugeri que eles experimentassem sem açúcar. Eles perguntaram se eu tomo sem açúcar e eu disse que sim. Aí disseram que eu não devo mais ter paladar pra gostar de um negócio tão amargo assim!

Encheram de açúcar e leite e nem tentaram experimentar sem açúcar.

Meu irmão ainda perguntou se eu não tenho mais nada pra fazer pra ficar perdendo meu tempo moendo café.

Resumo: nunca mais preparo café pra eles.",2,1735142274.0,cafebrasil,2,1.0,False

1hm370s,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1hm370s/merry_christmas_yall_pls_dont_destroy_me_on_this/,Merry Christmas Yall🎁🎄 Pls don’t Destroy me on this!,"I just need a place to be honest with myself, but also a place where it feels like someone’s listening. I’m 24, working two full-time jobs, and about to pick up a part-time one because it’s the only way I can survive. After paying my bills, taxes, rent, and replacing my bike tires, I’m left with just $98 to eat for the next two weeks.

I’m 24 but look like I’m 17 because I don’t eat enough or get any real time to rest. It’s been like this since I was 15. This year has been relentless, and somehow, I’ve managed to reach Christmas morning with nothing to show for it. I’m not trying to complain—I’m just trying to make sense of why I feel so empty today.

It’s confusing, really—this emptiness is something I’ve never felt quite like this before. I’ve always loved people. I get ridiculously excited when someone acknowledges me, even just a “what’s up” or any small sign that I matter. But today… I just feel invisible.

All I want for Christmas is a little change. No money, no friends, no family. It hurts even to admit that out loud. I just want something—anything—that makes me feel like my life is moving toward a better future.

Santa… if you’re out there, all I want this year is to feel something real. Something life-worthy. Even just a small moment of joy, like having a couple of extra bucks to buy some food or maybe even treat myself to a Starbucks coffee for Christmas.

I still love the world, no matter how hard it’s been. I try to see it as an adventure, and I tell myself every day to keep going—keep working hard, being kind, respectful, and sweet. Maybe someday I’ll catch a break.

Merry Christmas, world. 🎄🎁 Seriously. Merry Christmas to everyone. I love you guys and am so glad I get to exist alongside you.

P.S. If anyone has any advice—good or bad—I’ll take it. At this point, anything helps.",2,1735142259.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False

 This Christmas my DH got the decorations down. I put them all up bar one set of lights he did. I bought all the kids presents and wrapped the lot except for one main one he got, he didn't even have a clue what they had. I spent loads on him and I got back some bits the kids made but then random small things, cheap t shirt too small, a pj top, and some coffee syrups ( I hate flavoured coffee)
 Maybe it's my fault for spreading loads but he's barely spoke to me. Sitting on his phone doom scrolling. Went to lay on the bed. He's now on the phone ringing him family. 
 I might get a text off them if I'm lucky. Doesn't really feel like a marriage? Theres no team. 
He made dinner which was amazing so that was good but I dunno. I just feel alone!! His excuse for presents etc is always ""when do I get time!!"" As he works full time and I work part time
 But he manages go out and see friends. His off to see his family for a week ( I can't go as working) so you would think he would like to spend some time with me but he's already trying to fit his friends in.",2,1735142175.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I’ve been jobless by choice for a few months, I figured that after all this work I deserved some rest and starting a job right out of school in the dreadful summer heat wasn’t a something I fancied.  
Finally some time for rest and real fun after 5 grueling years of university that as much as it was fun it entailed a lot of hard work.

A few interviews later, I got 3 offers, I’ve had no exact vision of what I wanted to do exactly, and since there was no big difference in the salary offers I chose based on how far was it from my father’s job and how easy was it for him to drop me there and pick me up at the end of the day, while also avoiding the companies that had the reputation of working their employees to death.

I was a little bit late on my first day, and I was welcomed by a very nice girl from the team, a person that gave me one of the rounds of the hiring interviews and stayed in my memory mainly because of her beautiful smile and soothing voice.

We first had coffee and she explained to me vaguely the functioning of the team, then she took me on a round to introduce me to the other colleagues.  
I was intimidated by all these people looking intently at their screens seeming like they’re doing very important work.

It’s never comfortable to be the new person in the room, and I was feeling overwhelmed by how many faces I’ve seen so far, I started to think that this was a bad idea, I will never retain 60 or so names on the first day and maybe shaking all these hands was giving me al kinds of germs in the beginning of the flu season.

Somewhere in the middle of the tour, we arrived at this dude, body kind of on the hefty side, dressed all in black and wearing ugly outdated half frame eyeglasses with foggy lenses, he had a messy hair and smelled of cheap deodorant that barely covered his rather noticeable BO.  
He stood up, shook my hand and said «I’m X, I’ve been working here for less than a year and today is my birthday !» And I said «really ?! Well happy birthday to you» 

Then he turned to his screen and said let me open a terminal to scare you with my black screen and laughed childishly. I laughed too, it was the nicest introduction I’ve had, and it surely made me remember his name after that long first day.

I learned later that he was best friends with the person introducing me, and that he was someone rather important in the team despite the short experience.",1,1735142159.0,Tunisia,0,1.0,False
1hm358u,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hm358u/why_you_should_never_spend_christmas_alone/,Why you should never spend Christmas alone,"
Denise had known for weeks that I had cheated on her.

I think she’d already known when we were decorating the tree a few weeks before Christmas.

We were both silent as we filled it with the usual stuff, and some ornaments she bought in a thrift store.

Ugly as hell, but I didn’t say it. Like everything remained unspoken in our relationship.

When I came home two weeks later, her stuff was gone from our apartment. A sole text was the only confirmation I needed.

“I know about everything, asshole. Hope you have the shittiest Christmas ever.”

And yeah, it was. I was broken. And it was also the only time in my life I spent Christmas alone. My parents were vacationing, my friends had other plans.

On Christmas night, the remnants of my pizza in front of me, I was about to turn on my Playstation. Then the doorbell rang.

I had the faint hope it was Denise. That she would fall into my arms, forgive me for everything.

Again, that knot of disbelief in my stomach. One mistake, one DM I’d forgotten to delete, and she was gone. I wanted to kick myself. 

All my hope faded when I opened the door and saw an unfamiliar man. He was wearing a grey suit, dito hat and had a sad expression on his face.

Jehova’s Witness, I thought immediately, but I stayed polite and looked at him questioningly. It was Christmas, after all.

“You have something that belongs to me”, the man said gravely. “I want it back.”

“Erm”, I said. “What do you mean? Can I help you with something?”

“I want it back”, he repeated sharply. 

I changed my first observation about the Jehova’s Witness to ‘confused man’.

“Alright then”, I said, already closing the door. “Merry Christmas.”

He didn’t answer back. Returning to the living room, I could still saw his unmoving silhouette behind the door.

Note to self, I thought. Never open the door after nine. I peered out of the window of my living room, where I had a clear view on the front door. The man was already gone.  

Five minutes later I was immersed in the game I gifted myself for Christmas. But I started to feel uncomfortable as the evening advanced.

In short, it felt like someone was watching me. Several times I thought I spotted movement by the window, but when I looked there was no one there. 

The feeling became so strong, that I couldn’t focus. I turned off my Playstation and got up to pee, glimpsing out of the window. Although the street was empty, I could have sworn someone had just been standing there. An uneasy feeling in my stomach, I closed the curtains.

I felt a bit of a baby as I turned on all the lights in the apartment, but it eased my mind a little. 

Until I was in the toilet and heard a loud knock on my living room door. Just as I thought I had imagined it, there was another couple of knocks, more determined now.

Carefully, I crept to the door. One of the neighbours? This building had five other apartments, but I knew everyone left. It was Christmas, after all.

Through the peephole I spotted no one, the hallway was covered in darkness. My neck hairs prickled. The automatic light should have turned on if someone entered.

It stayed quiet for a long time. Just as I wanted to return to my couch, there were three more loud knocks.

Someone wanted to get in. And I realized something else: the door wasn’t even closed.

“Who’s there?” I asked with a shrill voice. 

No reply came, but the knocking persisted, not just from the hallway now. There was also pounding from the other side of the apartment, on the door that led to the garden. 

“What the fuck?” I whispered in fear. Some kids fucking around, it had to be.

When the tapping on the windows started, I gathered all my courage and yanked open the living room door.

The light flicked on and I peered out. No one. It was suddenly quiet in the other corners of the apartment too.

With a trembling sigh, I locked up.

It took an hour before I had convinced myself I'd imagined the entire thing. That I had been alone in this apartment for too long and should take a stroll. 

But I almost fell off my couch when my phone rang. Heart drumming in my throat, I stared at the screen and sighed. My mom. 

It was a pity call. She wanted to check in, since I was spending Christmas alone. I feigned indifference, said I could entertain myself perfectly. After ten minutes of smalltalk I threw my phone to the other side of the couch. To my frustration tears welled up in my eyes. Goddammit. 

My phone rang again.

“What is it, mom?” I asked, slightly irritated. 

There was only dead silence on the other end. I looked at the screen: unknown number. When I wanted to hang up, a cold voice spoke. 

“You have something that belongs to me.”

“Who the fuck are you?” I yelled in the phone. “And how did you get my number?”

But the line had already died. I checked my missed calls, but the last one had been with my mother. Impossible.

Mentally drained, I decided to go for bed early. Despite everything I sunk into an uneasy sleep quickly. That lasted until midnight, when I awoke and realized I hadn't closed the curtains.

My back was turned to the window, moon light casting strange shadows on the wall. Although I wasn’t wearing my glasses, I thought I recognized a figure with hat in one of the shapes. 

I had barely time to register it, when there was a tap on the window. 

My breath caught and I tried to turn around, but my muscles wouldn’t comply. I tried to calm myself. Sleep paralysis, that’s what this was. Your mind is awake, your body isn’t. You’re hallucinating. This is a dream, I told myself. 

But it was difficult to stay calm when I heard the unmistakable sound of my window sliding open.

I tried to move again, without success. There was a shuffling sound, someone moving. In my mind I pictured a man climbing through the window. He would enter my field of vision soon. 

Now I heard it, light foot steps on the carpet. From the corner of my eye I spotted a dark shape passing my bed, but the intruder didn’t halt. He went right past me, into the living room.

For minutes I tried to sit up, to scream. Until I finally awoke from that vivid dream, lurching upright and staring at the window. 

It was closed, just as my bedroom door. That calmed me down a little, although my heart was still racing. 

I knew it had been a nightmare, but I didn’t trust it. 

Tiptoeing I opened the bed room door, as softly as I could. The living room was empty. I checked every corner, behind every piece of furniture, a broom as improvised weapon in my hands.

But it was simply impossible someone hid out here. I uttered a sigh of relief and wanted to return to bed.

The foot steps came from the small aisle between my bed room and the living room. The only place I hadn’t checked. 

“You have something that belongs to me”, a voice said. 

I screamed, and this time my body cooporated. In a few steps I reached the door of my apartment, unlocked it and ran through the hallway, out of the front door. 

There I was outside, shivering from the cold on bare feet and in pyjamas. Luckily the police station was just around the corner, because my phone was still outside.

The officer in charge listened to my story incredulously and called a colleague. We went back to my house together, where the front door was still ajar. They barged in, but no one waited there. Nothing indicated that there had ever been someone else than me in the apartment that night. 

Except for one thing: the Christmas tree was lying on its side.

A curious detail, since the rest of the house looked so normal. 

The officers had decided pretty quicky they were dealing with an 'odd’ young man and left after a short while, offering some standard advice I barely registered.

Sunken in thought I picked up the Christmas tree. Nothing had felt out, surprisingly. Except for one of Denise's ornaments from the thrift store.

A kind of medaillon with a small photo. I had noticed it before, but never given it a closer look, figured it depicted some kind of Christmas scene. 

But now I saw it was a yellowish photo of a woman and child. With their somber faces and vintage clothing they seemed to be straight from a gothic ghost story. I felt goosebumps.

My phone vibrated on the coffee table.

When I saw it was a text from Denise, I opened it eagerly. “Had a merry Christmas?” my ex wrote, accompanied by a Christmas tree emoji.

I called her, but she didn’t answer. It was the last thing I ever heard from her. It didn’t matter how often I asked her what she meant by it, or how many voicemails I left.

Although I felt like a complete idiot, I din’t want to take any risks. So I finally took that stroll, to a nearby park. I threw the medaillon in the pond as far as I could. Gazing around, I half expected to be regarded by a man with a hat. Or by Denise, wearing a mean grin on her face. 

But I only spotted a woman walking her dog. She gave me a strange look, and obviously thought I had a screw loose. 

Back at home I dumped the entire Christmas tree in the trash. Just to be sure.

Did I really believe that Denise (it sounds absolutely insane), cursed me? Had taken revenge by sending someone? Or had I simply been hallucinating for the lack of sleep and all those days alone in that small apartment?

The latter seems more probable. But then what about her text, and the complete radio silence after?

Although I never saw the mysterious man again, I didn’t stay in that house much longer. It felt tainted there, whether it was because of my broken relationship or something else.

And one thing I know for sure now.

------------------------------------------------------

Are you considering enhancing your smile with teeth whitening services in Salt Lake City? You're not alone! Many individuals in the area are turning to professional whitening as a quick and effective way to boost their confidence and improve their appearance. Let’s explore the advantages of choosing teeth whitening services and why they might be right for you.

### Immediate Results

One of the most compelling benefits of professional teeth whitening is the immediate results. Unlike over-the-counter products, which often take weeks to show noticeable changes, in-office treatments can whiten your teeth by several shades in just one appointment. You can walk in with a dull smile and leave with a radiant, bright grin, ready for that important occasion.

### Safe and Effective

Teeth whitening services in Salt Lake City are administered by trained dental professionals who understand the science behind whitening. Using high-quality products ensures that the process is not only effective but also safe for your teeth and gums.

### Customized Treatments

Every smile is unique. Professional whitening allows for customized treatments tailored to your specific needs. Dentists perform an initial consultation to assess your dental health, existing tooth color, and personal preferences. This process ensures that you receive the best possible results for your individual situation. Whether you have stains from coffee, wine, or tobacco, a tailored plan can address those particular concerns.

### Long-lasting Effects

Teeth whitening services offer results that last much longer than over-the-counter options. While at-home products require consistent use to maintain whiteness, professional treatments can often keep your teeth bright for up to two years, depending on your lifestyle and oral hygiene. Regular touch-up treatments can help maintain that dazzling smile.

### Boosts Confidence

A bright smile can significantly impact your self-esteem and overall confidence. When your teeth look good, you’re more likely to smile, which can positively affect your social interactions and how others perceive you. After treatment, many patients find themselves smiling more often, leading to a more positive outlook on life. This simple enhancement to your appearance can open doors and create new opportunities.

### Convenient Options

At-Home Teeth Whitening Techniques and Products Available in Salt Lake City
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whitening your teeth at home can be a convenient and affordable option, especially if you live in Salt Lake City. Many people desire a brighter smile, but they may not always have the time or means to visit a dental office for professional treatments. Fortunately, a variety of at-home teeth whitening techniques and products are available that allow you to achieve a dazzling smile right from your own bathroom.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
One of the most popular at-home teeth whitening methods is using whitening kits that contain trays and gel. Many stores in Salt Lake City carry these kits, which typically include a bleaching gel that you apply to custom-fit trays. These kits are designed for easy use and can yield noticeable results. Here's a list of some common types of whitening trays:

- **Custom-fitted trays:** These trays are made by your dentist to fit your smile perfectly for the best results.
- **Boil-and-bite trays:** These trays are available over-the-counter and can be softened in hot water to create a semi-custom fit.
- **Pre-filled trays:** These convenient options come filled with whitening gel and can be used right out of the box.

Whitening strips have gained popularity due to their ease of use and effectiveness. These thin, flexible strips are coated with a peroxide-based whitening gel. Simply place the strips on your teeth, and they adhere without the need for trays. You can find several brands in local Salt Lake City drugstores, and they usually provide instructions for wearing them over a set period. It's important to follow the instructions closely to avoid tooth sensitivity or uneven results.

If you're looking for natural alternatives, you might consider using baking soda or activated charcoal. Baking soda is mildly abrasive and can help remove surface stains. To use, mix a small amount of baking soda with water to make a paste, then gently brush your teeth with it. However, avoid using this method too often, as it can wear down enamel if overdone. Activated charcoal is also popular for teeth whitening. It's believed to absorb impurities and help lift stains off teeth. You can either find toothpaste containing activated charcoal or use the powder directly by wetting your toothbrush and dipping it into the charcoal.

Another technique is oil pulling. This ancient practice involves swishing a tablespoon of coconut or sesame oil in your mouth for about 15-20 minutes each day. People in Salt Lake City are increasingly adopting this method for its potential benefits in teeth whitening and overall oral health. While scientific evidence on its whitening effectiveness is limited, many users report a decline in stains and improved oral hygiene.

Moreover, professional-strength whitening gels designed for at-home use are also an option. These gels often contain higher concentrations of peroxide and can be more effective than over-the-counter products. You can discuss your options with your dentist to find the right gel for your needs. Many dental practices in Salt Lake City offer these products, allowing you to use them in the comfort of your home.

In addition to these whitening techniques, maintaining good oral hygiene is essential for keeping your teeth white. Regular brushing and flossing, combined with routine dentist visits, can prevent stains from forming. You might also want to limit consumption of staining foods and beverages, such as red wine, coffee, and dark sodas. If you do enjoy these treats, rinsing your mouth with water afterward can help minimize their staining effects.

When considering at-home whitening products, it’s crucial to read reviews and choose those with proven effectiveness. Many products in Salt Lake City come with user feedback that can guide your decision. Consult with your dentist before starting any whitening regimen, especially if you have sensitive teeth or existing dental issues.

Whitening your teeth at home in Salt Lake City can be an excellent way to achieve the smile you desire without the need for lengthy dental appointments. Consider the various options available and choose a method that fits your lifestyle and preferences.

I feel like I have to get this out of my head and off my chest. I have for years. It just reminds me of the same things, over and over again. I’m not the favorite of my family. I’m often the scapegoat. Often the last thought of. I’m pretty severely disabled. I’m autistic (nonverbal), a wheelchair user, etc. but I’m slowly making a life for myself. I’m at a college for the disabled getting a college degree, and I’m engaged. Christmas is pretty big in my family, and my parents are big on family so it isn’t even a “you’re too old” thing. 

This year, my mom hyped up Christmas for me. She said that I would get gifts and things, and would be spoiled. I think she felt bad at the time for the previous years. I don’t blame her for anything really. My sister got a 58inch TV and a Xbox and T-shirts of her favorite bands and things. My twin got an espresso/coffee maker. My brother-in-law got an expensive new monitor. My little sisters got everything you could think of, sensory swings, a TV for their play room, toys, etc. You get the picture, they got expensive gifts. I got a few small things, but my main gift was a cirkul waterbottle. I had asked for it, but i definitely wasn’t expecting it as my main gift. 

I don’t even know why I’m really surprised. This happens a lot of the time. One year, I got a portable phone charger as my main gift. My sisters got phones and other expensive gifts that year. I remember bursting out in tears that year and my dad cried and my mom was upset. Some years they’ll just promise me money so I can buy myself things then never give me the money. I don’t know why I’m surprised, or even hurt. Yet every year I end up hurt. I know I should be thankful, and I feel bad for even feeling this way, but it still hurts for some reason, and I don’t know why. ",3,1735141952.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.8,False

**No Awkward Meetups:** These apps let you connect with sugar daddies (and mommies) right from your phone. You can get financial support without awkward coffee dates or dinner obligations.

**Privacy is Key:** Keeping things online means keeping your identity under wraps. You can enjoy the perks without worrying about anyone snooping around your business.

**Set Your Own Terms:** Whether you want a one-time boost or a long-term arrangement, these apps let you call the shots on your terms.

# Top Sugar Daddy Apps

# Seeking Arrangement

This one's a classic! With over 20 million members, it's like the Facebook of sugar dating. You can tailor your profile for online-only interactions and enjoy the perks without meeting IRL. Plus, it's loaded with privacy features to keep your deets safe.

# SugarDaddyMeet

Quality over quantity here! This app is all about meaningful connections without rushing into a meet. You can exchange messages and virtual gifts, making it perfect for those who prefer keeping things digital.

# What’s Your Price

The fun twist? Sugar daddies can bid for dates! You get to decide based on offers and keep everything virtual. It's a unique way to experience sugar dating from your couch.

# OnlyFans

Yep, OnlyFans isn't just for influencers. It's a great place for sugar relationships too. Share your content for a subscription fee and enjoy financial support while keeping it personal.

# Bumble BFF or Bumble Date

Bumble isn't just for dating! Use it to find sugar daddies too. You can specify your intentions and build friendships that might turn into financial support, all without rushing to meet.

# Features to Look For

**Secure Payments:** Make sure the app has solid payment options. You don’t want any sketchy transactions messing up your money game.

**User Verification:** Real people only, please! Look for apps that verify users to keep scammers at bay.

**Communication Tools:** Apps with messaging, video calls, or voice notes are a win. They help build a connection before any money changes hands.

# Tips for Success

**Standout Profile:** Be genuine. Use good pics and share your interests in a fun way. Make them want to know more about you!

**Clear Expectations:** Be upfront about what you want. It saves time and sets the stage for a smooth arrangement.

**Stay Safe:** Keep chats in-app until you’re sure. Trust your gut—if something feels off, it probably is.

So there you have it! Dive into the world of sugar daddy apps and snag some financial support without leaving your house. Just remember to stay safe and enjoy the ride!",1,1735141814.0,CyberCupid,0,1.0,False

I ordered from Df64coffee in the end of October pre-sale batch. Around the 11th of November I send an email asking them what the status was. About 3 days later it was sent out and around the 20th of November I received the grinder (in Germany).

However, an intital check showed that the alignement as good as I have seen it anywhere online (marker test). So far so good. The second espresso was flawless - much more flavor and balance than the SGP by miles. My first try choked the machine, which my SGP was not able to do. However I believe that this was also an issue because my SGP was quite old and has worn burrs. The speed is also much better - as expected.

The holiday season is a magical time. It’s when we reconnect with family members, reminisce with loved ones, and create cherished memories. But while many celebrate moments of togetherness, it’s also a time when feelings of loneliness can be overwhelming for those who lack meaningful connections. The holidays, a season symbolizing unity, can paradoxically become the most isolating time of the year for some.

At Socialode, we understand this deeply. Our mission is to build a platform that fosters real friendships, not just fleeting interactions or superficial connections. Unlike traditional social media or dating networks, Socialode is a friendship network designed to help people form genuine, organic friendships based on shared interests and hobbies, all while respecting their privacy. Our goal is to connect people globally, breaking down barriers of race, language, and distance through tools like language translation. We want to create a world where friendships are built on who you are, not what you have or how you look.

# Why We Built Socialode

The inspiration behind Socialode stems from personal experiences. Many of us on the team have felt the sting of isolation, particularly during the holidays. Instead of waiting for these difficult moments to pass, we decided to create a platform where anyone can find meaningful friendships. Our structure is unique, guiding users through a process that ensures connections are genuine and enduring. This isn’t about followers or status; it’s about finding people who see you for you.

As society becomes more digital, we’ve noticed an alarming trend: the more connected we seem, the more isolated we often feel. Walk into a coffee shop, airport, or grocery store, and you’ll see people engrossed in their phones. This is the world we live in, and while we can’t change it, we can adapt. Socialode aims to harness the digital world to foster real human connections, bridging the gap between technology and meaningful interaction.

# Looking Ahead

This holiday season, our team is taking a brief pause to spend time with loved ones, but we’re gearing up for an exciting year ahead. In January, we’ll resume full operations, expanding our platform and team. We’re actively seeking talented front-end developers and engineers to help us grow Socialode at a faster pace. This is more than just a business venture for us; it’s a personal mission to combat loneliness and build a community where everyone belongs.

As we continue to develop Socialode, we’re committed to creating a space where individuals who feel lost, lonely, or disconnected can find real friends. Our platform is designed to respect privacy while facilitating authentic connections. Next holiday season, we hope that those who currently feel alone will have a place to turn, a place where they can connect with others who genuinely care.

# A Message of Hope

For those spending this holiday season with family and friends, cherish these moments. Time moves quickly, and what feels permanent today can change in an instant. For those who are struggling with loneliness, know that you are not alone. Socialode is being built with you in mind. We’re working tirelessly to create a solution that will help people form meaningful friendships on a global scale.

From all of us at Socialode, we wish you a happy holiday season.

Remember, with Socialode, you just need to be you.

While I am close to both parents, I was his mini-me. We had similar personalities and could just look across the room at each other during family things and understand each other. We'd be in the kitchen cooking brunch together escaping family chaos and drinking coffee. 

Now, five days later...on Christmas... I am in a crowded house with the rest of my family, people I love dearly, but feel so alone.

**Citizenship application**

[I mentioned this last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/18v51c8/blog_my_2023_year_in_review/) but it is of course a slow process.

After almost 12 months of waiting I got a response - asking me to provide another document…

Then shortly after that came an invitation for a short interview. The interview was fairly relaxed and being done on the federal level through the simplified citizenship process was fairly basic. Half of the time was speaking about myself and why I like Switzerland, the other half was on general knowledge questions which a well prepared tourist would probably get right (e.g. name 2 swiss cheeses).

Everything should be done now, and all I have to do is wait for the final confirmation and documents.

A dedicated post on the process and interview will follow some time in the near future.

**Jura Reds**

[My goal for 2022 had been to tick off all the red mountain paths in the Jura.](https://alionswitzerland.com/hiking-red-mountain-paths-jura/) I didn’t quite manage that in 2022, or 2023, but I finally ticked off the final segment in September this year with a [hike through the Vallée de Joux](https://alionswitzerland.com/hike-lac-de-joux-vallorbe/).

It has been a fun project and took me to a number of beautiful places that I might well have never thought to go near otherwise.

---

**Black Forest cycling tour**

After years of meaning to do so I finally got around to [cycling from north to south through the Black Forest in July.](https://alionswitzerland.com/cycling-the-black-forest/)

In a certain sense this was more of the same of what I had seen already, but there are slight differences in the landscape and architecture. It was good to see a number of places I had heard about many times before, and the weather was generally nice which is always a big plus.

---


**Other things in Switzerland**

Some things I have written up, others are in progress, and some I have only mentioned in brief or not at all.

A few highlights from this year:

* Inspired by the citizenship application [I decided to finish off visiting every community in Canton Solothurn.](https://alionswitzerland.com/visiting-every-gemeinde-solothurn/) I had already ticked most of them off with my adventures throughout the years, but there were a number of really out of the way places which I would never have seen otherwise. 
* [2 weeks based in Saanen exploring the numerous valleys and passes in the area by mountain bike.](https://alionswitzerland.com/trip-cycling-around-saanen/)
* I finally made it to [Romainmôtier](https://alionswitzerland.com/hike-romainmotier-tine-de-conflens/). The village is beautiful, but the Romanesque church was the real star of the place.
* With a [hike in the spring](https://alionswitzerland.com/hike-biaufond-saut-du-doubs/) and then [a mountain bike ride in August](https://alionswitzerland.com/mtb-along-the-doubs/) I finished off the entire length of the river **Doubs** within Switzerland. I will someday see the source in France and maybe follow it to the Rhone…
* I ticked off another [Tolkien location](https://alionswitzerland.com/tolkien-hobbit-lotr-switzerland/). Staying at the [Hotel Obersteinberg](https://alionswitzerland.com/hotel-obersteinberg-upper-lauterbrunnen/) in the upper Lauterbrunnen valley where the author signed the guestbook. The rear part of the valley is worth the trip for the scenery and lack of crowds (the main area around the villages was insane) but the hotel itself is quite the experience.
* A trip cycling over Alpine passes (Nufenen - Lukmanier - Oberalp) in September was rather disrupted when a storm dumped early snow forcing us to constantly watch the weather and pass status. In the end we had to ditch the Nufenen (for the 2nd year in a row) and replace it with the Gotthard, but otherwise it went well. I can highly recommend the **Lukmanier** as just being stunning on both sides.

---

**International travel**


* I cycled around **Lake Constance** ([along the southern shore at Easter](https://alionswitzerland.com/bike-lake-constance-rhine-1/), then along the [northern shore at the end of August](https://alionswitzerland.com/bike-along-lake-constance-part-2/)) and up into the Black Forest. I had only seen the lake briefly or from afar before so it was good to take a closer look. I have to say the German part of the lake was much better with nicer towns (for the most part) and the mountains in the background when looking across the lake.
* A long overdue month in **Australia** with family on the Gold Coast in October. I had hoped to get further afield to Tasmania and maybe a few other places, but after a hectic trip getting out we didn’t do more than local things and a road trip to Stanthorpe. The sunshine and cheap and good coffee was enjoyable at least. Though landing into the fog in November was rather grim.

---

**Website**

I got an unexpected boost in clicks from the US presidential debate when the topic of [eating cats and dogs came up](https://alionswitzerland.com/do-the-swiss-eat-dogs-and-cats/).

---

**Health**

The long-covid problems seem to be gone which is good.

This year's problem was a particle which appeared in my knee and sometimes floated into a painful position in the joint. Thankfully it only happened twice and I was able to have it removed.

So hopefully smooth sailing into 2025.

---

**Plan for 2025**

* A trip to **Nottingham** in the spring. It occurred to me that I haven't been back to my childhood home in almost a decade, so feel the need to reconnect a little.
* A week in the **Alsace** in spring. I have done Colmar/Strasbourg a few times but never actually made it into the vineyards and villages. I also want to get up into the Vogesen mountains and to the numerous castle ruins. The more research I do the more it seems I will be going back another time with a different base.
* Possibly Graubünden in early summer. There are a number of valleys and passes around Scuol that I would love to explore by bike.
* The standard things I keep meaning to do but never get around to doing.",2,1735140651.0,ali_on_switzerland,0,1.0,False

I recently went through a heartbreak and found myself living alone again after a relationship ended. It has been a journey, adjusting to the quiet, finding my rhythm, and rediscovering who I am on my own.

I did not put up any decorations this year, no tree, no lights, no music. For someone who loves Christmas, it felt strange, but I just did not feel up to it. Instead, I focused on the little things I could do for myself.

In the afternoon, I decided to go for a drive with no particular destination in mind. I was not looking for food or coffee, just some time with my thoughts. As I drove, I stumbled upon a theater showing ‘Mufasa: The Lion King’ Without hesitating, I parked, got a ticket, and treated myself to a medium popcorn.

Walking into the theater surrounded by families, couples, and groups of friends, I realized something: this time, I did not feel out of place. I did not feel self conscious about being on my own. I simply enjoyed the experience.

The movie itself was powerful, and its message struck a chord. It reminded me that even when life feels dark and hopeless, there is always light waiting on the other side. Somewhere out there is my own version of Melele, a place or state of being where I will be truly healed and happy. I just need to keep moving forward and believe in it.

This Christmas, I gave myself the gift of hope and independence. And for the first time in a while, I felt proud of myself for choosing to live fully, even through the pain.

Wherever you are on your own journey, know that your Melele is out there too.

Coffee isn't sticky, and brewed grounds really aren't greasy or contain high amounts of fat.

Coffee grounds also float. So if water is ran after they get dumped in the sink, they should float right down the pipes and traps.

So when I re-plumbed my old house, I made sure to use traps that could screw apart. The kitchen sink had it's own trap, and the kitchen sink drain drained into the washing machine drain in the basement, and that too had it's own trap.

After 6 months of daily ground dumping, at least 1 cup per day, over 180 days or roughly 10 milk jugs full of ground coffee, I took the traps apart.

Not a single speck of grounds were found in either trap.

Oddly enough, if you look online, you will find all kinds of sites warning you to not do this, but very few actual pictures, videos or cases of a clog actually occurring. 

Maybe back in the day when people used lard and high amounts of actual, pipe clogging grease the grounds added to the chaos.

1hm2gmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hm2gmh/kingrinder_k2_k3_k4_k5_and_k6_comparison/,"Kingrinder K2, K3, K4, K5 and K6 comparison","This review took a great deal longer to put together than I thought. I went through almost a kilogram of coffee beans before I felt comfortable with my findings but here it is finally.

Some time ago I did a comparison between the Kingrinder P1, P2 and K2 hand grinders. You can see that here [https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ercmgn/update\_on\_experience\_with\_kingrinder\_k2\_p1\_and\_p2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ercmgn/update_on_experience_with_kingrinder_k2_p1_and_p2/)

My thoughts at the time were that they all made great espresso for use in my Cafelat Robot, however the differences between them were mostly workflow related. For instance the P series grinders are smaller with smaller grips and straight handles with smaller burrs so they require more effort to grind with and the P2 was more difficult to grind than the P1 due to it's different burr design. The K2 was a much nicer grinder to hold with larger, easier to turn burrs, an offset handle that put less strain on the wrist and a wide rubber grip. The espresso it produced was marginally better than the others but really the big difference was how much nicer it was to use.

Knowing that the K2 was easily worth the $35 price increase I pondered whether the same would be true of the top-end Kingrinder K6. Kingrinder makes six K series grinders but in this comparison I'll focus on the 5 large burred K series grinders numbered K2 - K6. These five grinders are a mix of 2 burr designs in 2 metal coating types using 2 form factors. To do a comparison I didn't need to buy all 5 because of the similarities between them. I've created a table that explains the difference.

* K2, K3, K4 have the same 6 point burr geometry and make the same coffee
* K5 and K6 have the same 7 pointed burr geometry and make the same coffee
* K2, K3, K5 have internal burr adjustments
* K4 and K6 have external burr adjustments

If you look at this list you'll notice that the K2 (internally adjustments, 6 pointed burrs) and K6 (external adjustment, 7 pointed burrs) cover all of burr designs and form figures so I was able to do a reasonable comparison with only two grinders.

**Burr Geometry**

The K2, K3 and K4 have the same burr geometry so in theory they produce the same style of coffee but it should be noted that the K3 and K4 have titanium coated burrs which may make them last longer than the regular stainless steel coated burrs of the other two. Since my test is short the titanium coating would not in theory have any impact on my results. The six pointed burr geometry is very similar to the Kingrinder P1 but superior in that the burrs are 10 mm larger requiring less effort to grind.

The K5 and K6 have a 7 pointed burr similar in design to the P2 but also 10 mm larger lessening grinding effort.

**Form Factor**

The K-series grinders come in two form factors depending on how grind adjustments are done. The K2, K3 and K5 have internal grind adjustments that can be accessed inside the catch cup whereas the K4 and K6 have a top mounted grind adjustment ring that can be accessed without taking the catch cup off.​

https://preview.redd.it/dbnmdvltf09e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=988674a23d0223e8897c51b4a1545680ea807e0e

On paper the K4 and K6 have 60 clicks per round as opposed to the 40 of the K2, K3 and K5. On paper this could lead one to believe that the K4 and K6 have 50% more granularity in their grind size over the K2 but if you look at the microns per click you'll see that each of the K6's clicks equates to 16 microns and the K2's clicks equate to 18 microns. That's a difference of 10% and so small that it's probably just a product of the 7 star burrs as opposed an intended design improvement by Kingrinder. Going from the P2's 33 microns per click to the K2's 18 microns was noticeable but going from 18 to 16 makes little measurable difference. Because the K6 has more clicks per round it requires a lot more time cranking away on the adjustment dial trying to get into the general ballpark than the K2.​

https://preview.redd.it/vn1acr11g09e1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=642bf9424320e5b3dce7c52ec75443451b8262f2

The K4 and K6 have larger 35 gram catch cups which makes little difference for me because I only grind for espresso and the 25 gram catch cup on the K2, K3 and K5 grinders is perfectly fine. However, if I grind 18 grams of beans using the K6 the night before and then grind another 18 grams of beans the next morning while half asleep the catch cup IS large enough to hold it all - I know, I've done it. On the K2 I'm made aware of my mistake halfway through when the grinder stops grinding because it's plugged due to the smaller 25 gram catch cup. For pourovers the larger catch cup could be useful.

All K series grinders have the offset handle that allows the turning knob to orbit around grinder body putting less stress on the wrist of the hand holding the grinder which is an improvement over the straight handle of the P-series grinders. It should be noted that the K4 and K6 have a nice teardrop shaped knob whereas the K2, K3 and K5 have a simpler round knob. This makes a bigger difference than you might think. I'll get back to that.

**My Espresso Machine**

I'm using a Cafelat Espresso Robot manual lever machine which gives me a ton of feedback and even more control over the shot. It has proven to be a perfect machine to flush out the differences in grinders. My target espresso was a 10 second pre-infusion with a 30 second pull at 9 bars. This is what I started with as the beans I'm using provide a balanced shot using this timing. I did however pull many shots shorter and longer as well as slayer shots just to experiment. I dialed both grinders in depending on how they tasted best which ended up with two different types of shots.

For all shots I used 18 grams of coffee, a wire distribution tool, a leveling distributor and pressure sensitive tamper all built for the Robot. Then the shot was pulled with only the shower screen and no paper or additional screens.

​

My beans are type garnica, caturra and typica harvested in 2024 from Veracruz Mexico, medium roasted, washed process, fermented for 46 hours and dried in the sun. I chose these for the test as they lean a bit fruitier and a tad more acidic with nice clarity so I thought they'd display the differences between the 6 point and 7 point burrs better. I may run this test again later with another different type of bean that leans in on chocolate and body.​

https://preview.redd.it/pwysnbg9g09e1.jpg?width=2940&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bb18bea87e455dae4026aa8434017c8cedf0b9b

**The test.**

When I first got my K2 I dialed it in using about 36 grams of coffee total. Essentially I ground some coffee in the DF64 with SSP Sweet Cast burrs, and then just ground out a little with the K2 and felt it, then adjusted the grind, ground some more, felt it again and adjusted again. I kept doing this until it felt as close to the output of the DF64 as I could tell. I then ground a full 18 grams and pulled a shot. It needed to be tightened one click and was spot on. My everyday workflow for the K2 is to grind 18 grams and pull a shot. If the shot comes up 5 seconds short I adjust the dial clockwise one notch and put the catch cup on so it's ready for another shot later. If during the next shot it needs adjusted I move it one notch again. This way I'm using relative adjustments, I don't really know how many clicks from zero I'm using. This is partly because it works but also partly because the K2's design dictates it due to the internal burr adjustment.

I fully expected to dial in the K6 the exact same way but for reasons I still can't explain it just didn't work that way. I went through 250 grams of coffee bouncing around trying to get it consistent and then I ran out of coffee and started a new bag so had to dial both grinders in again. The K2 dialed in within a shot or two and the K6 seemed to need a lot more adjustment to get it close. I'd crank it a few notches and sink the shot and do it again. Eventually I got it pulling decent if not acidic shots. Consistent enough at least that I could start playing.

**The flavor results**

The flavor results largely come down to the differences in the 6 pointed burrs and 7 pointed burrs. I started with the K2 which can be adjusted down to 18 microns of precision and using the beans that I'd chosen I found acceptable espresso occupied about 3 clicks. One less click and the shot came up at about 25-28 seconds and clearly leaned acidic, two clicks tighter and the shot went 10 seconds longer with the acid being replaced by a lingering bitterness on the end of my tongue. Right between these two, the acid and bitter disappeared. This is what makes it easy to dial in, there's a definite ""right"" grind for it. I settled on a 10 second pre-infusion at 2 bars and 32-35 second shot at 9 bars for the best balance. I think I've mentioned the beans I'm using like to go a bit long.

The K6 shots always lean more toward acidic. If I tighten up the shot to a 10 second pre-infusion at 2 bars and a 40 second shot at 9 bars it's *still* acidic but lingering bitter gets layered on top. Going extra long with a 10 second pre-infusion and 50 second shot it's really bitter and the acid is still there. This grinder confuses me a bit. The acid never fully goes away no matter how I grind. This makes me think that it's making boulders no matter what grind setting it's on. As it gets finer the fines get over extracted and the boulders are still there which are under-extracted. I have Kruve sifter plates to test but didn't get around to it. I *think* they'd prove this out but I'll need more time to know for sure.

**The Workflow results**

The K4/K6 grinders have a few improvements over the K2, K3 and K5 in that they have external adjustments, and nicer teardrop shaped knobs. Both grinders will grind 18 grams in about 40 seconds so there's no difference there.

When I ground the first shot using the K6 I swore the barrel of the grinder was larger than the K2 as it felt larger and harder to hold onto requiring increased effort. After grinding 3 or 4 shots I was positive that the body was larger so I got out my micrometer to prove it and I was wrong - they're exactly the same size. After watching my hands while grinding I realized that with the top mounted 30 mm wide burr adjustment ring required my hand to be further away from the handle putting extra stress on my wrist. Attempting to ""choke up on the bat"" resulting in my hand bumping the adjustment ring. I don't think this is a deal breaker but just be aware. When grinding with hand grinders you have 2 types of grinding effort - the easy-grinding effort when beans are being shaved appropriately and then the crush-effort when a stubborn bean needs to be broken up.

Subjectively the K6 feels like it requires less easy-grinding effort than the K2 until a bean catches and then more effort than the K2 to get through it. The K2 feels like it requires more easy-effort shaving away at beans but powers through crushing them. Please note that this is not a scientific test in any way. I have now ground over a kilo of coffee going back and forth between them every 10 seconds. Also note that the K2 is now 6 months old and has been used continuously during that time whereas the K6 is brand new. I can't discount bearing wear.

**Summary**

I went into this thinking there would be an absolute winner like in the P1, P2 and K2 test but I was surprised that there isn't. I believe for espresso the 6 pointed burrs are just better. They're more consistent, easier to dial in and I can get them to make just about any shot I want (at least with the coffee I have). However the same could be said for the K4 as it has the same burrs.

As for usability, I'm torn. The knob on the K4/K6 *is* superior. It shouldn't matter that much but it does, it's just nicer to use. Concerning the advantages of external adjustment vs internal I'm not quite sold. If having a top ring requires my hand to be further away from the handle requiring more torsional strength than I'm not sure I want it. If they could put the ring on the bottom then maybe I'd be in. As for the usability improvement of having external burr adjustments themselves, I *think* that it could be useful but in my workflow it doesn't matter at all. I want to think it's more than just for marketing and I hope it is. External adjustment allows for absolute adjustment whereas internal adjustment makes that difficult so you will have to rely on relative adjustment. What I mean is that with an external ring you can SEE how many times you've made a complete revolution plus you can see how many clicks into that revolution you are. This would in theory allow you to go between two drastically different grind settings quickly. Relative adjustment doesn't allow this at least in the practical sense. You could zero out the grinder and count out your clicks each time you changed it but it's not really practical. Using relative adjustment you just change the adjustment tighter or looser depending on the resulting espresso and don't pay any attention to how many clicks you're at (until you bottom out).

I don't know how practical it would be to crank away on the K6 adjustment burr for a couple of revolutions for a pour over and then crank it back down for espresso. I just don't see it working well that way. For *my* workflow the relative internal adjustment inside the catch cup works perfectly fine. I wouldn't mind having a bottom external adjustment ring though, I wouldn't turn it down.

**Other factors to consider**

Both grinders allow you to replace the handle with a drill adapter in case your arm gets tired... I'm not going to lie, I've considered getting an electric screwdriver for it. Note that the P-series Kingrinders do not have this ability. The K2, K3 and K5 are a tiny bit smaller in height, but I don't think I'd make a decision based on that.

There's also the difference in price. I'm listing prices in USD direct from Aliexpress because I don't know where in the world people will be reading this.

K2 - $61.49 ($49)

K3 - $81.49

K4 - $106

K5 - NA

K6 - $110 ($97)

I also found other vendors that had the K2 for $49 and the K6 for $97. These were the cheapest prices I could find. I could not find a price on the K5 so perhaps it's no longer produced. I have a hard time imaging the K4 or K6 costing 60% to 90% more than the K2. I think that for my needs a K3 with a knob from a K4/K6 may be the ideal hand grinder as the burrs would be titanium coated and the knob comfortable.

**What's next?**

As usual this comparison created as many questions as it answered. I want to test the K2 and K6 with the Kruve sifter plates to analyze the distribution. I also want to try both grinders with my other favorite coffee which is a bean from Oaxaca Mexico and leans into roasty and chocolate notes. Maybe my initial assessment of the 7 pointed burrs was incorrect and it will shine with a less acidic bean.

Of course there is also the question of pour-overs. I will not be testing this as I don't make coffee that way but I wonder.... I will leave that for someone else.

Note: Testing with my beans from Oaxaca has commenced. I will provide an update when I have some results. I may get out the Kruve plates too if anyone is interested.

I'm currently in an apartment, so cupboard and drawer space is super limited. So, I have them in stacks on my counter. This gets a bit problematic because the lids get wavy over time from the dishwasher and don't stack up nicely, so the stack is super unstable. Pulling one off the top can send clean lids spilling all over the counter. Also, I'm not sure why, but having them sit directly on the counter bothers me a bit, I'd like them raised so I can clean under them.

All containers take the same lid, which the manufacturer says is  4.72""W. I'd love to find some rack, like ones that might [hold disposable coffee cups](https://www.amazon.com/Organizer-Disposable-Presentation-Restaurant-Accessories/dp/B0BGNGRP89/ref=sr_1_41) in a breakroom, with 4 compartments, each one being something like 5"" square, Ideally in a horizontal layout, rather than 4-square. I'd love a wire one even more than a plastic one so that nothing can accumulate on the bottom.

In Denmark, we celebrate Christmas on the evening of December 24th, with a festive feast and the exchange of gifts. The following day, Christmas Day, is quiet and relaxed – the perfect time for my adventure to begin.

The oven hums softly in the kitchen, cleaning itself after yesterday's efforts with roast duck and pork. A symbol of the festive hustle winding down, giving way to something new – my journey. The house is silent. My wife sleeps soundly after her night shift, and the teenagers are still lost in dreams behind closed doors. I know it will be hours before their world stirs.

With a steaming cup of coffee in hand, I sit down at my Amiga, its gentle hum like a ship ready to set sail. The screen bathes the room in a soft, blue-green glow. One click, and I am no longer Mogens, father, and husband. I am a young, ambitious captain in the Caribbean of the 17th century – a world of treasures, notorious pirates, and sunlit horizons.

Already, I can feel it: a warm breeze carrying the scent of tar and saltwater from the Spanish coast. The gentle lapping of waves against the pier mingles with the creak of rigging and the groan of wooden ships swaying in the harbor. The sun beats down on my shoulders, and I can almost hear the cry of frigatebirds circling above.

My hand rests lightly on the mouse. With each click, I explore bustling port markets, chart courses to distant lands, and prepare to face the dangers of the open sea. The map before me is crumpled and water-stained, yet full of secrets and promises of riches. I’m ready to set sail into the unknown.

Ahead lies the lure of buried treasures under palm trees, the thrill of chasing rival pirates, and perhaps, if fortune favors me, the hand of a governor’s beautiful daughter, securing my legacy with titles and land.

Each click of the mouse draws me deeper into this world – navigating treacherous waters, striking deals, and battling foes in the roar of cannon fire. It won’t be easy. Storms, schemes, and peril await in the shadows. But that’s what makes it worth the journey. One day, when I’ve had my fill of adventure, I dream of retiring to a grand plantation, rich and respected, with memories of the freedom and triumphs of the sea.

Today is the first step. The Amiga is my portal, and I’m ready to embark. An adventure calls – and I answer.",2,1735139472.0,amiga,0,1.0,False
1hm2dnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hm2dnz/i_feel_like_im_being_taken_advantage_of/,I feel like I'm being taken advantage of,"I (21F), don't live at home but I stay for extended periods of time around the holidays (summer and christmas). Whenever I am home, I feel like I'm constantly driving people around. I'm the only one in my immediate family who knows how to drive so when people do need lifts it's up to me. Don't ask me how they manage when I'm not here - I think they might be planning around the fact they can get lifts when I'm here without really asking me. Now, I'm actually perfectly okay with giving people lifts - I do actually quite like driving around and listening to music. And also, my mum pays for my car insurance, my road tax and any vehicle repairs - so when giving my 2 kid sisters (12 and 17) lifts I don't even care about having to pay for the fuel cost. I wish they could ask me when I can give them lifts, especially my 17 yr old sister but like I say, my mum pays for a lot of my car costs so it's the least I can do.

My brother, (19M) is totally different. He is an adult, he has a job. I expect fuel money from him. I also don't like the fact he refuses to learn how to drive because he ""doesn't want to take money from our mother"" (Ignoring the fact he does have a job, constantly asks our mum for money and spends all his money on alcohol and drugs). I will drive him though. I know I really shouldn't but he does need to get to work. (He's on the same schedule as me, we're usually home around the same time because we're both uni students so he does actually rely on me to get to work). I want fuel money but whenever I ask it's said ""yeah yeah I'll give it to you"" and I never get it. I'm honestly sick of it, and I know he's taking advantage of the fact that I know he NEEDS a lift and I will give him one (including when I had to get up at 3am to take him to the airport, and when he only made himself a coffee). I have been out with friends and he's phoned me asking for a lift and he knows I will drop everything to give him one. It's my own fault for being such a push over but whenever I have refused I get shouted at and insulted and whatnot. It's far easier on my mental health whenever I'm home to just do it.

We also both go to uni in the same city, which means I have also had to help him out during term time. When he first moved into uni, he turned up at my house at 4am high needing his phone to be charged and an uber to find his friends. It cost me £25. Multiple times he has turned up to my house to crash on my sofa in the early hours of the morning. What am I supposed to do? Turn him away? My mum wouldn't be best pleased with me if I did. He's in a vulnerable state, there's a reason he's turning up here. I WANT to look after him. I WANT to be useful. I don't mind it. I love my family and if I can help them out I will.

Today is obviously Christmas and we're opening presents. My brother has gotten my 2 sisters quite expensive jewellery and me... handcream. Even my mother was shocked at the thoughtlessness behind my gift. It's not even like I expected a gift from him - I thought we were just doing secret santa to give gifts between the siblings - but looking and what he got my sisters versus what he got me... I just felt insulted and rejected. He then says to me ""he doesn't even like me"". A punch in the gut. I thought he felt at least some appreciation for the time and money I spend on him. He assumes that he can treat me however he wants and I will still do anything for him, and he's right. I will. I hate myself for being such a pushover but I feel so guilty and awful for thinking that I deserve better; that I feel guilty for even thinking that I do too much.

Ideally, I am looking for spontaneous meets over food, movies, walks, coffee catch ups, etc. I'm happy to chat here for a bit to build trust and vet each other before meeting.

A little about me: INFJ, work full time (mostly from home) STEM role in a corporate company. I'm quite shy and introverted, empathetic, and family orientated. I can be silly, cheeky, and sassy at times too. I'm also in a long-distance relationship, so I'm looking for strictly platonic friends.

My interests: 

• Long walks through Central London

• Foodie (Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Indian cuisines). I'm always looking to try new cuisines. Always leave space for dessert.

• Heavy metal, hip hop, rap, grime, and acoustic but generally listen to anything. I like going to small/ medium-sized venues for live music gigs. Open to finding new gig buddies.

• Movies (horror, mystery, action, Disney/Marvel, Studio Ghibli, DC, comedy, sci-fi, true crime, psychological thrillers are my favourite) 

• West End theatre shows, plays, and musicals. Since covid, I've been going to 3 or 4 every year.

• Museum and gallery exhibitions. I have a 2 for 1 art fund pass, so I am open to finding a culture vulture buddy.

• Anime (Bleach, One Piece, Jujitsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, Death Note, Code Geass, One Punch Man, Naruto etc)

• Binging Kdramas (Move to Heaven, Beyond Evil, Stranger, Signal, Vincenzo, The Glory, Through the Darkness, Sweet Home etc). Happy to exchange recommendations.

• Video games (EAFC, BO6, Pokémon, BG3, Stardew Valley, ACNH etc). Open to gaming buddies :)

• Attending EGX or comic con at least once a year. 

• Self care via gym, spa days, retail therapy, and Sunday drives.

If you are looking for a new friend in London then please get in touch with a bit about you.

I have just bought a used Oscar Simonelli II. It is some years old but have just been serviced with a new O-ring. But there is a problem: When I pull a double-shot without grinded beans in the portafilter, I get some 40-45 grams of water, and the machine is dialed in to run 40 secs. When I used grinded beans, I get some 10-12 grams of espresso from the same 40 secs. I have tried to used as little as 10 grams of coffee and to grind it really course. I am also certain that I do not stamp it too hard. So could it be that the machine is not able to produce enough pressure? It is the version without OPV. I have actually bought a kit - but uncertain if I should install it since something else might be wrong. Any ideas?

Honestly if you’re still wonder wether it’s worth the price or if you’re gonna have to deal with flaws and static all the time, all I can say from my experience that none of this is as bad as you’re reading around. I live in a pretty dry house and have almost zero static or mess without doing rdt, just use the bristle once in a while and It’s going to be fine. The workflow is pretty good and the stepless adjustment makes it very easy to dial in new beans. So from my experience I would recommend it to anyone that’s on the market for a new budget coffee grinder.

I shaved my beard and mustache off yesterday. Decided to put an end to it when my beard wasn’t beard-ing. I’m probably gonna end up growing it out sometime again. I’m just happy it grew out better than it did last time I did, shit wasn’t patchy either. 

I didn’t have much plans besides heading to my grandmas house with my dad and brother. My dad’s partner had work today, she didn’t have to work, but Mexicans love the grind. He didn’t want to head to my grandmas though, I’m not really sure why he was having an attitude over it. Shit, he was having an attitude with me over it, giving me the silent treatment. Kinda had to put my foot down cause I wasn’t having any negativity today. Even though, family can drive us crazy, they’re still family. 

Well, I did understand why my dad was feeling that way. 

She invited us to eat at her place and was annoyed when I couldn’t even finish the plate.  I knew she heard me say that I didn’t want too much, yet she didn’t hold back on the damn beans. Had to be all rigged from the start. Didn’t help that my dad didn’t want to eat anything either, talking about how he was full. That man only had a croissant, fruit, and coffee for breakfast... I had to lie in his behalf to not make it seem like an insult to my grandmother that he didn’t want to eat. Didn’t really seem like he wanted to be there either. I’ve got to talk to him later about that, but there’s a good chance that I’ll just get the silent treatment. My brother was the only one REALLY eating, which is better than none of us eating. 

It was sad that none of our other family was here though. We used to be so close with one another, we’d all be spending Christmas with one another. Last time that’s happened was over a decade ago. Opening gifts under the tree in my aunts house. My mom, grandma, and aunts cooking up breakfast and lunch in the kitchen. My brother and I would be chasing my cousins, playing stupid games we’d make up. My dad and uncles would be telling family Christmas stories, I’d later join my dad with buying pizzas from Pizza Hutt for dinner, that would be a tradition of our family. 

I can’t even remember the last time we were all in a room together. Now the most conversation I have with my cousins is just some hi’s or hello’s and a door shut to their bedroom. We got to make the most of what we do have in the present though. And when I mean present, I mean in the current, not actual presents. 

I was going to give my grandparents my money, but the last time I tried handing my grandma some money, she began hitting me. Abuelita behavior. So I’m going to have to find another way to get her that money. I’d give it to my grandpa, but he would just head to the corner store and spend it all on soda and junk food. That man has Coca Cola in his veins. Unlike nearly all the guys in my family, I’ve never seen him drink alcohol, but that’s cause he already had Coke. 

My aunt later got home, wasn’t able to talk much to her, but fuck. I knew her Christmas present to me was not judging me, I feel like she’s always got to say something critical about me whenever I see her. She’s nosey like that, at least she cares… in her own way. 

My dad’s partner soon walked in, just getting back from work. It was time for my brother and I to enact our plan. We planned on doing it tomorrow, but figured that we would just do it today to make it more convenient. We made our goodbyes to our family and talked about how we had to visit my mom for her own festivities. It was technically the truth. We were heading to my mom’s later for festivities, but we were heading there first to pick up the TV.

Before driving off to get it, my brother had to clean the snowflakes off his windshield. Now, that wouldn’t be a problem if his wipers actually worked, they didn’t. He reminds me of my dad in how he was frugal, except for the fact that my dad knew when money should be actually spent instead of taking the easy way. Like we’ve been in the winter for a while now, how haven’t you fixed your wipers yet. He’s practically fucked if a snow storm were to hit. Thank god, it was barely snowing,

We got to my mom’s and she was already in the middle of cooking dinner. We somehow managed to fit the TV in the backseat. Probably not the best way to move a 55 inch TV, but we made it work. I was hoping that we would have enough time to set the TV up, even texted my dad to see if he was still at my grandmas to make sure. I didn’t get a text at all, but the driveway was empty. Made sure to get that shit inside the house, told my brother to park his car at the front so that it wouldn’t be visible.

Well, that was a smart idea since we saw another car pull up not even five minutes later. Now, we had to do Plan B, which I improvised fast. I hid the TV away in my dad’s room. Told my dad and his girlfriend to not go in there room since we had a surprise. They were shocked once we brought out the TV.  They were ecstatic. My dad no longer had that same attitude he had earlier lmao, . They had been thinking about getting one for a while now, so why not just get it for them?

We still set up the TV anyway, I’m happy that I double checked if I had screwed on the legs for it right. Turns out I didn’t check well enough the first time. We also had to move some shit around the house because the old TV stand wasn’t even long enough to fit the new TV. Had to bring in this table, it’s kinda wobbly, which did concern me at first, but it’ll do the trick. I’m definitely making sure to get a new one soon though since it looks ugly. All it matters is that it works for the time being. 

My brother and I then got left to head to my mom’s, my dad and his partner were leaving as well to head to church so it was good timing in a way. A part of me wanted me to go to church with them. But I also felt it would be shitty of me if I only went to church for Christmas. It’s not even like Im religious anyway, but I keep that to myself to keep the peace. 

My mom had decorated nicely for Christmas. Same Christmas tree we’ve been using for many years too, but fuck, it still does the trick. We had dinner, it was pretty fucking good. I didn’t end up eating as much as I would like I was already full from earlier, even though I barely ate that much either. It’s pretty wild how much these meds have affected my appetite. I would literally eat just to eat, wouldn’t even be hungry too. Now breakfast alone could leave me full for the rest of the day. But that isn’t exactly healthy either. 

Definitely gonna be eating some more tomorrow though. 

My brother and I then opened up our presents, my mom said it was cool for us to open them now. I received some great clothes and a sweet letter from her. She ended up getting me a shirt in the wrong size though, so it’ll have to be returned. I gave my sister the presents I got her, which was all Barbie related things. Shit, I’d rather have her play with any of her toys than be on that iPad. We figured my presents would satisfy her until tomorrow morning since she was getting a bit impatient. I don’t think she cares if Santa is real or not, all she cares is the presents anyways. I kinda respect that. She had me play house with her and them Barbie’s afterwards. 

My mom only wanted these winter boots for Christmas. My brother hadn’t even ordered them yet. We even asked if she wanted anything else because what’s the point if winter will be over in a couple months. She just said that she’s fine with those boots, even refused when I began to hand her cash…. I guess she’ll only be getting boots. 

I think it’s better just outright asking someone what they would like as a gift because they’re guaranteed to like the gift. I never really got how that could be seen as an issue to some. 

We all then watched a Christmas movie, the Christmas Chronicles. I was surprised, I actually ended up liking it. My sister kept spoiling the movie for us since she had watched it already with her dad. Either I’m underestimating the intelligence of first graders, but fuck, she impresses me with how articulate she is and how good her memory is. I sure as hell wasn’t doing shit like that when I was in the first grade. I think it just shows me how slow I was developing as a kid lmao, teachers had me taking special ed for a reason. 

We also had hot chocolate while watching that movie. We had some of that Abuelita iykyk. I made sure to not drink it right away since I wasn’t trying to burn my mouth. But fuck, just love how the mini marshmallows melted into the chocolate. Had to be the best hot chocolate I’ve ever had. 

My mom then dropped me off home, she wanted me to stay the night for Christmas morning, but fuck, I’m not trying to do that again. I definitely fucked up my back a bit after sleeping on that couch the last time I did. Didn’t help that the heater was on blast or that the fucking Christmas tree was bright as fuck. Although it took me more than it should’ve to realize I could’ve just turned it off.

I got home around the same time my dad did, then took some photos with my father at the nativity scene his partner had created, actually looked pretty good. My brother had thought she bought it off a store even. We all then went to sleep since we’ve all had long days. 

Today was an awesome day. Merry Christmas.

Theatre - Grotesque: This one starts off with a strong, almost synthetic orangey note. Luckily, it dries down to a sweeter, but cloying, sandalwood. Initially, I hated it, but now I'm kinda growing on it. Might actually finish it off. 2/5

Zara - Red Vanilla: Okay, where's the vanilla? I don't get any vanilla from this one. It's more of a warm, spicy fruit punch vibe. Not my cup of tea. 1/5 

Zara - Fields at Nightfall: Warm, woody, spicy, and it actually lasts on me for a good few hours. I don't really get the jasmine note that everyone talks about, but I'm not complaining. Dries down to a powdery, spicy sandalwood. 5/5

Zara - Lightly Bloom: This one's a bit meh. It opens with a sweet, fresh note but barely lasts 30 minutes. 1/5

Victoria's Secret - Fresh and Clean: This is my go-to workout mist. It smells exactly like freshly squeezed lemon, which is very refreshing. Not the longest lasting, but I don't expect much from a mist. 3.5/5

Sol de Janeiro 40: This one's interesting. It opens with a blast of alcohol, which fades away pretty quickly. Then, you get this - don't know how to describe it, it kinda reminds me of my childhood Barbies? Apparently, a lot of people get that vibe too. It dries down to a fruity vanilla. Not as hyped as everyone makes it out to be, but it's not bad. 3/5 

Sol de Janeiro 62: This one is delicious! Nutty, pistachio caramel goodness. Perfect for the office – it's inoffensive but still makes a statement. The dry down is amazing, I keep sniffing my wrist like a maniac. I only got a travel size, but I'm seriously considering getting the full size. 5/5 

Sol de Janeiro 59: This was my first SDJ purchase, and it's a beauty. Creamy vanilla with hints of sandalwood and sugared violets. My mom absolutely loves it. Another great office-friendly option. It lasts a bit longer than 62 on me. 5/5 

Sol de Janeiro 71: This one smells exactly like a tub of caramel popcorn. It's amazing in the winter, but I feel like it might be a bit too much in the summer heat. Plus, the longevity is pretty poor. My sister actually thinks it smells like pee, so there's that. 3.5/5 

Lattafa Eclaire: I know this is supposed to be a caramelly fragrance, but when I first sprayed it, all I could smell was coconut curry. I know there's no coconut in it, but that's what my nose is telling me. I'm hoping it macerates and the caramel notes come through. I'm a bit worried about wearing it in the summer though, it might be too heavy.

Bath & Body Works - Fresh Vanilla Blossoms: It smells exactly like freshly washed sheets with a hint of floral sprinkled on top. It's a nice, light and airy scent when you want something that's not too overpowering. 4/5

Victoria's Secret Bare Vanilla: Okay, the hype around this one is REAL. I'm so glad I finally got it. It's the creamiest, softest vanilla fragrance I've ever tried. I keep sniffing myself all day long. 10/10, would repurchase in a heartbeat.

Victoria's Secret Bare Vanilla Cashmere: This one smells similar to Bare Vanilla, but it's a bit sweeter. It still has that creamy vanilla base, but with a touch of patchouli. I got this as a gift after I wouldn't stop raving about Bare Vanilla. It's nice, but I prefer the original. 3.5/5 

🍃Decants🍃

Estée Lauder - Modern Muse Nuit: This one has a strong, spicy opening. It dries down to a creamy vanilla, but it's still a bit synthetic for my liking. Not bad for evening wear, especially in cooler weather. It lasts for a good 4-5 hours on me, and the sillage is pretty strong too. 3.5/5

Dirham - Gold: This one smells exactly like those cheap, sweet, and slightly alcoholic perfumes I used to wear in college. Nothing special about it. I barely reach for it. 1/5 

Sol de Janeiro - Do Not Disturb: This one is hands down the WORST Sdj I've tried. It smells like a concoction of rotten fruit mixed with some kind of synthetic chemical fragrance. 0/5

Bath & Body Works - Cozy Vanilla Bourbon: This might be my favorite BBW fragrance. It smells like rich, warm, boozy vanilla. I keep sniffing myself all day long when I wear this one. It lasts surprisingly well on my clothes too. Might have to grab the full size if I can find it. 5/5

BDK Parfums - Gris Charnel: I was so excited to try this one based on the notes, but it was a huge disappointment. All I can smell is this overwhelming earthy tobacco note. It doesn't fade into anything else, and it's just not for me. Waste of money. 0/5 

Bath & Body Works - Warm Vanilla Sugar: This one reminds me a bit of Sol de Janeiro 62, but without the pistachio nuttiness. BBW really knows how to do vanilla fragrances. It starts off with a bit of an alcohol blast, but it fades quickly. 4/5

Bath & Body Works - Pink Pineapple Sunrise: I got this as a freebie, and honestly, I wouldn't have picked it out myself. It opens up with this super fruity scent that gets cloying after a while. It actually gives me a headache. 0/5 

Aeronot - November: This one is a bit of a love/hate for me. Some days, I get this beautiful pear and coffee note that's so cozy and inviting. Other days, all I can smell is jasmine, which I'm not a fan of at all. Be warned, this one can stain your clothes. I learned that the hard way with a white shirt. 3/5

Lattafa - Yara Moi: This one is just plasticky. Sickly sweet and reminds me of a nail polish remover I used to have. 0/5 

Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato: I have to say, Khair Pistachio is a spot-on dupe for this one. I had a decant of Khair Pistachio, and I finished it within a week. They smell almost identical. This one has a sweet, creamy, nutty pistachio opening, but the dry down smells like a woody soap to me. And I actually love it. It lasts all day too. 4/5 

Paris Corner - Khair Fusion: This one opens with a strong, sweet fruit candy scent. But the dry down is a bit cleaner, almost shampoo-y, with the fruity scent lingering in the background. Maybe my teenage self would have loved this one, but it's not really my vibe now. 2/5 

Versace Crystal Noir: This one just smells like a generic spicy perfume to me. It feels like something I've smelled a million times before, maybe on my aunts at weddings. Nothing special. 2/5 

Paris Corner Eternal Coffee: This one is a no go for me. It smells like those sweet, cheap coffee candies that I used to get as a kid. It's actually a bit nauseating. I might just toss this one. 0/5 

Burberry Goddess: I have a feeling the decant I got might be watered down or something because it doesn't smell as strong as the one I smelled at the mall. The one at the mall was amazing! It's a stunning vanilla perfume with notes of lavender, which just elevates it to another level. I might have to get a full size soon. Based on the mall tester, 5/5 

Paris Corner - December Vanilla: This one smells exactly like paan pasand (IYKYK) . I absolutely hate it. There's no vanilla, just this overpowering sweet paan and rose scent. 0/5

Lattafa - Khamrah Qawah: This one smells exactly like warm, spicy cinnamon pie. I don't really get the coffee note that everyone talks about. It might be nice for cooler weather, but I don't think I'll be repurchasing it. 2.5/5 

Al Rehab - Choco Musk: This one makes you smell like a bakery that just freshly baked a batch of chocolate treats. It's a bit synthetic, but not too bad. I don't reach for it often, but it's not unpleasant. 3/5

Lattafa - Ameer Al Oudh: This one is strong! It's a smoky, woody fragrance that reminds me of the aftermath of a bonfire. It lasted on my clothes for days after I sprayed it. Definitely not my thing. 1/5

Lattafa - Fakhar Rose: This one gave me a headache. It's a strong jasmine and rose combination, and I'm just not a fan of either of those scents. I got this one as a freebie, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. 0/5 

Muse Beauty - 

1. Smoky Vanilla: This one is supposed to be inspired by Kayali Vanilla 28, and I think they did a pretty good job. They both make me feel slightly weird in my teeth. I don't know if anyone else experiences this, but it's a weird sensation. 4/5 , decent dupe, but I won't be repurchasing it.

2. Caramel Pistachio: This one is a pretty spot-on dupe for Cheriosa 62. The only downside is that the longevity is pretty bad.

3. Espresso Vanilla: Supposed to be inspired by YSL Black Opium, but I haven't smelled that one, so I can't compare. To me, it smells like a sweet jasmine scent with a slight hint of coffee. It's a bit boring.

4. Cinnamon Apple Pie: Smells exactly like the name suggests. It's supposed to be inspired by Lattafa Khamrah, but I'm not a huge fan of Khamrah. I love gourmands in general, but this one's just not for me.

5. Lavender Latte: This one is inspired by YSL Libre Intense, and it's my favorite from Muse Beauty. It's a gorgeous lavender scent.

I’m a decent conversationalist, though I can be a bit shy at first but that's where your doggo could help break the ice!

A bit about me: I absolutely love animals and have always wanted a dog, though I’m too fattu to get one on my own. I used to have a cat who meant the world to me, and I’m planning to adopt a new fur-baby soon. I'm a corporate intern right now with very little idea about where life's headed. I've been living one day at a time and it seems to work so 🤷🏻‍♀️ no complaints.

Writing an intro is a lot harder than I thought it would be. For now, I'd invite you to stalk my profile a little bit to get an idea about me lol but I promise I'm not as depressing as my reddit persona. Let’s definitely chat a bit before deciding to meet—mostly so I can figure out exactly how to win your dog over right away.

I’m 24, working two full-time jobs, and about to pick up a part-time one because it’s the only way I can survive. After paying my bills, taxes, rent, and replacing my bike tires, I’m left with just $98 to eat for the next two weeks.

I’m 24 but look like I’m 17 because I don’t eat enough or get any real time to rest. It’s been like this since I was 15. This year has been relentless, and somehow, I’ve managed to reach Christmas morning with nothing to show for it. I’m not trying to complain—I’m just trying to make sense of why I feel so empty today.

It’s confusing, really—this emptiness is something I’ve never felt quite like this before. I’ve always loved people. I get ridiculously excited when someone acknowledges me, even just a “what’s up” or any small sign that I matter. But today… I just feel invisible.

All I want for Christmas is a little change. No money, no friends, no family. It hurts even to admit that out loud. I just want something—anything—that makes me feel like my life is moving toward a better future.

Santa… if you’re out there, all I want this year is to feel something real. Something life-worthy. Even just a small moment of joy, like having a couple of extra bucks to buy some food or maybe even treat myself to a Starbucks coffee for Christmas.

I still love the world, no matter how hard it’s been. I try to see it as an adventure, and I tell myself every day to keep going—keep working hard, being kind, respectful, and sweet. Maybe someday I’ll catch a break.

Merry Christmas, world. 🎄🎁 Seriously. Merry Christmas to everyone. I love you guys and am so glad I get to exist alongside you.

I (F31) just ended a 9 year relationship with my boyfriend (M37) - an addict in recovery. He has been sober for 11 months, but his emotional immaturity really made it hard for me to keep coping. He gets angry for really small things since his sobriety (for example : being extremely angry when making a joke with a mutual friend that he always wants to leave very early when we need to go somewhere).

I believe it has to do with his low self esteem that is coming to the surface. He acknowledges this too, but still he feels that I don't understand him. The last time he was very upset when he made coffee for everyone on a trip with friends, and the last day of the trip a friend asked if we bought the coffee ourselves or if he got it from the cupboards in the appartment. He told her he found the coffee in the cupboards, which she replied to that they never take anything from the cupboards (appartment rented from a family friend). He took this very personal and was so upset and angry about it. It took an hour or longer for him to feel okay-ish again and act normal. 

Afterwards my friend told me she and her BF felt like they had to walk on eggshells the whole time and she never knew this side of him. She found it 'admirable' how I could deal with this behaviour on a regular basis. 

I tried to talk to him about it because I felt his reaction was unfair and disproportional towards our friends, but he felt as if I was worried more about our friends feelings than his feelings. He though I should just support him no matter what.

Eventually I gathered all my courage and asked him to start relationship therapy, but again he felt very attacked (""I worked so hard on myself this year, you want perfection,...""). Afterwards he calmed down and told me he was okay with starting therapy. But something in me already snapped. I just felt so tired and left our house the next day. Initially to find some peace for myself, but I just did not want to go back home to him. So after two weeks at my dad's house I broke up with him. 

It's been a couple of weeks now and he really hopes that I change my mind and give our relationship another shot. He says he wants to grow old with me. He believes we can work on it together, but I feel like I can't fix his low self esteem issues and it is affecting my happiness and my mental wellbeing (I feel small in the relationship and I constantly adjust myself so I don't make it harder for him being in sobriety).

I don't know if I am making a big mistake by ending things now that he is sober and trying to work on himself. I am just devastated because there still is so much love between us. I am just so scared to feel stuck again.

1hm1vt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wifi/comments/1hm1vt9/friendship_lamps/,Friendship lamps ,"Hi all.  So, my sister got me these “friendship lamps” for the holidays this year to use with my niece. The brand is zoci voci. The way they work mystifies me, and I have some questions.

When you plug one in, it creates a new Wi-Fi network called “telepathy lamp”. You are supposed to join that wifi network (even though it’s not connected to the internet), then you go to the zoci voci website, where it lists all the local Wi-Fi networks in your vicinity. You then pick your home Wi-Fi from the list and enter the password on zoci voci’s website, as well as an email address that “links” the group of lamps.  Each lamp connects to a different wifi but uses the same email so that they can communicate with each other. You communicate with other lamps by tapping your lamp, which in turn changes all the lamps in the group to the same color.

So first of all I want to get off my chest that this kind of thing is really not my cup of tea.  I’m hardly ever home, and when I do get home from work my niece is already in bed (time zone difference), and I also think it is weird that we would send each other signals that we “see” each other like prisoners across a yard, when we can just interact on FaceTime like normal people. My sister picked this gift “from” my niece on her behalf, and frankly she doesn’t even seem interested in it either. I would have liked to have gotten a real gift from my 8-year-old niece that she picked out herself - a “super aunt” coffee mug coming from my niece would have meant so much more to me than my sister picking out what I consider to be useless, and, it also seems, overly expensive, clutter.

I really hate the things and I feel like I’m going to be guilted into constantly checking mine to see if my niece is changing the color when I simply don’t have time to faff around with it.

But unfortunately, y’all can’t help me with that.  Here are my questions for you:

1) I feel weird typing out my private Wi-Fi password on this company’s website, especially since I need my Wi-Fi to be HIPAA compliant, as a therapist.  Is there a security concern I should know about?

2) Will being hooked up to this lamp 24/7 affect my Wi-Fi’s performance?

I (M,23) recently moved to bangalore and tried multiple dating apps and luckily got multiple dates. I usually ask my dates about what they are expecting and similar stuffs!

I am basically looking to grow as a person as well as grow as a software developer (cafe hopping, exploring city, treks, trips, themed cafes… are also part of it, but not a major point of concern). I want us (me and to be girlfriend) to cook food together and build projects read research papers… on weekends. (This is my expectation)

This I can’t put on those dating apps (else no match, I tried). I go out to tech meet-ups but obviously can cringe out the other person there by asking for a coffee date 🤧.

I'm the developer of WalkScape, and I've posted here updates about my game's progress over the past year.

First off, we have a new wave that's open until 7th of January, so if you want to start playing you can! You can get access by supporting the game on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WalkScape) or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/walkscape). And it's holiday season, so here is a link for [50 free Patreon memberships](https://www.patreon.com/WalkScape/redeem/B4257) that also give access to start playing right away! ❤️

I'd also like to thank you all for all the support and feedback that I've got when posting here. As an aspiring game developer, I took a huge leap of fate when dropping out of university to work on this full time. Now I have some sort of financial stability doing it, and we have three other people that work on the game as well. None of this would've been possible without the support I've got from here and other subreddits where I've posted about the development progress. So thank you!

Working on this game has been an awesome (but tough) journey. My biggest highlights definitely are the community interactions. I've received at this point countless DMs, emails and feedback messages on Discord where people tell me that the game has helped them. I never anticipated such when starting to work on this game as my personal means to become more active as I've struggled with exercise. But comments like that are the best kind of motivator!

For those who aren't familiar with the game, you can check [our website](https://walkscape.app) to read more, and [we have a youtube video](https://youtu.be/RjaQeb5Rapg) where I explain the game with our artist. We also have a subreddit r/WalkScape where I post updates about development every two weeks if you're interested!

Happy holidays r/CozyGamers and thanks once more for all your positivity and support from the behalf of our team. It means a lot for our small development team. And let's hope next year will be as awesome with the game becoming even better! ❤️

I recently moved to a new city in which I towed the car behind a U-Haul. The car remained parked. Unfortunately the house I was moving into fell through which resulted in me living in said car. While driving to the gas station (I was completely on empty, in -30 I needed the gas to keep warm) I was pulled over and given grace for my situation, was told to get to my location safely and park the car, renew my sticker and get insurance. Unfortunately without an address I was unable to do those things, I did try, the car remained parked. Fast forward a week later I have found somewhere to live, a 6 minute drive from where I was parked. Figured it was worth the risk to drive since I couldn't keep my car at the location it was at any longer either. I stupidly decided to stop for a coffee. While sitting in my car in the parking lot of Tim Hortons I was stopped again. The car was not currently moving and they did not see me on the road, however they are correct in assuming I was going to drive the car. They stated that they will be charging me for this instance as well as the one last week. They towed my car and it's been impounded. 

Basically I just want to know what my rights are in this situation, I have had people say it can't be inforced because it was on private property, or that they can't charge me for both because they chose not to the first time. I've never been in legal trouble before and I'm really at a loss, any advice or input is greatly appreciated. 

I'm in a small Ontario town and it was OPP who pulled me over if that is important.

—

To my dearest,

Hi! How have you been? I hope you are having a blast during the holiday season, and that you’re spending the day with your loved ones. Did you travel somewhere, or did you celebrate at home? What’s the best food you had for Noche Buena? Whatever story you may have, please tell me all about it. I’ll be happy to listen, for sure. Don’t forget to get some rest too!

As for me, it’s a cold and gloomy Wednesday evening. It’s raining gently outside, and the sound of the droplets are quite comforting. The bed is cozy, and the sheets are keeping me warm. I was so occupied for the past few months, and today is quite an unusual scene for me, as I’ve always found myself busy during this time of the week. While most are outside, having fun, and celebrating the spirit of Christmas, I decided to celebrate alone, and enjoy my moment of solitude.

Perhaps it’s the rain, combined with the thought of being lonely that I suddenly felt that I’m yearning for you. Yes, you, a person from a distant future— someone I have yet to met. I’ve been longing to write a letter just so I could show it to you on the day that I accept the truth that I am in love with you.

I wonder about you often. Are you the kind of person who loves the quiet stillness of early mornings, or do you come alive in the magic of midnight conversations? Are you introvert by default, but can bring out your extrovert side when you’re around the right people? Do you have a favorite song that stirs your soul every time you hear it? Do you dance when no one’s watching, or maybe when everyone is? Do you sing your heart out in the bathroom like me? I can’t wait to discover all the little things that make you, you—the quirks, the habits, the pieces of your heart that will become the center of my world. I wonder what your name is, how you look like, how tall you are, how your voice sounds like, what kind of books you read, who your favorite author is, what your favorite show, food, places, and hobbies are. I want to know everything about you.

Somewhere out there, you’re living your life, perhaps dreaming your own dreams, perhaps facing struggles and victories that one day we’ll share. And while we haven’t met yet, I want you to know how deeply I long for the day our paths finally cross. I wonder how our first encounter will be. Will it feel like a moment out of a movie—serendipitous, electric, and unforgettable? Or will it be something beautifully ordinary, like a shared smile or a casual hello that later transforms into something extraordinary? Are you someone I’ve never met before, someone entirely new who will bring a fresh perspective into my life? Or could you be someone I’ve crossed paths with in the past, whose presence I didn’t fully notice until the right time? However it happens, I know that meeting you will mark the beginning of a chapter I’ve been waiting my whole life to write.

I dream of the life we’ll build together— a life filled with love, laughter, and adventures. I dream of mornings where we share coffee and plans for the day, and evenings wrapped in warmth, cuddles, and comfort. I dream of us exploring the world hand in hand, creating memories in places we’ve always wanted to visit, and finding joy in the simplest moments—like cooking dinner together or dancing barefoot in the kitchen. I imagine us as a team, supporting each other’s dreams and weathering life’s storms with love as our constant and unwavering foundation.

I want you to know that I’m working to become the person you deserve. Every day, I’m striving to grow—to be kinder, more patient, more understanding. I want to be someone who will support your dreams, stand by your side in hard times, and celebrate every joy with you. I’m not perfect, I have a lot of flaws, but I promise to always give you the best of me. In a world full of cruelty, guilt, and anguish, you deserve a gentle, kind, and comfortable kind of love— a love that makes you feel safe to be vulnerable, and a love that is thoughtful and welcoming. I’m working on myself to be a man who is capable of giving you this kind of environment so you would feel safe and secured in my presence. I want to be the first person that comes to your mind whenever you are troubled, sad, in need, or when you are at your happiest and you just want to share your thoughts to someone.

Oh, and this letter will not be complete without me giving you life updates! I turned 29 last October. Looking back at this year, it makes me smile thinking that my life is slowly coming together. I may not be successful yet, but I hope you are proud of me because I did my very best this year— that I didn’t slack off and give up when times were challenging. I was able to fix my stream of finances, upskill, and solidify my value in this new career path, complete my big projects at work (hopefully will get promoted next year🤞🏻), and got my loan approved for a condo unit for turnover on 2026. I’ve been doing my best to take care of myself too! I found a new skin care routine that works best for me. I’m still lacking on sleep on some days, but I’m trying to work on it. I’m also looking to be more consistent on hitting the gym moving forward, and buy new set of clothes to fit my new style. I want to look dashing for you.

I went through a heart break in the latter part of 2023. It wasn’t an easy process. There were days that I felt so empty and lethargic, but I’m okay now! It really helped that I was so busy and had a lot of hobbies. My friends were there for me when it mattered the most, even without them knowing that I was hurting at the time. Maybe the reason why my past connections did not work is that there is someone out there who is really meant for me, who will really understand me, and accept me for who I am, and that she is just taking her time before entering my life. Don’t worry as I haven’t closed my doors yet— I’m waiting for you patiently. I went to a lot of family occasions this year, and everyone’s asking me the same thing: “Kailan ka ikakasal?” Little did they know that we haven’t talked about it yet. Just you wait, titos and titas! We are just taking our time!

I’ll be going to Australia next year to help my sister with her household chores for around 3 months while she’s healing. She’s expecting to give birth to her son by around April 2025. Magiging legit tito na ako.😂 I might be busy by then, since I’ll be juggling between remote work, online courses, and assisting within the household. I’m really looking forward to it since I heard there are so many amazing places and food in Melbourne! I’ll make sure to take some good snaps so I could show it to you one day.

I hope you are okay with us having a dog. My Instagram reel algorithm is full of them, and I miss having one. Border Collies are cute, but they require a lot of activities so they won’t get bored. Maybe a Golden Retriever, or a Corgi? God, they are so cute when they smile! Although I’m not sure if our furnitures will be safe since they like to go for a lot of zoomies. We can also adopt a stray dog and be foster parents together.

I’ve been meaning to travel the world, but I’m reserving all the first country trips until the time that I can have you as my companion. I want you to be the first person who will come to mind when I dig my memories about a certain city or country, so that when I talk to our future kids, I will be like ""Your mom and I went to that city, and we had an amazing time together."" I can take great photos. I can also create our travel itineraries and book our tickets, so all you have to worry about are your outfits. But, if you want to join in on the fun of planning things, then that would be very welcome too! Anyway, I just realized that an hour had already past past since I started writing this. It’s true that time flies really fast when you enjoy what you are doing— in this case, it’s me writing to you, my future wife.

I believe that love has a way of finding its way to us when the time is right, and when it does, I know it will feel like coming home. Wherever you are, I hope you’re taking care of yourself and nurturing your beautiful soul. One day, our stories will intertwine, and when they do, I promise to cherish every moment we have together, and be present for you, always. Until then, I’ll keep dreaming of you, praying for you, and holding on to the belief that our love will be worth every second of the wait.

*If you are reading this now through my phone, then that means I must have already confessed my love for you.*

*Shall we go out on a date, then?*

Last month, I went to Yorushika x Nagato Tetsuya-san’s collaboration exhibition in Harajuku, Tokyo. It was at a little place called The Plug. Maybe just around 10 m x 10 m? Went on opening day, within the first two hours, and there was already a small crowd there.

[The Plug, Harajuku, Tokyo \(27 November 2024\)](https://preview.redd.it/ybvtc018wy8e1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62b2838d58143bf315e98e23f4144b0f72528a3b)

They displayed the collage arts featured in “Taiyou”’s MV, as well as some of Nagato-san’s other collage works. They were on sale (200,000-700,000 yen range), but I’m not sure about the huge one featured as “Taiyou”’s jacket cover art. Didn't see it on the sale listing, but I could be wrong. There was nothing else being sold. I’d hoped for some merch, unfortunately there weren’t any.

At the exhibition, they looped this very Dakaboku/Elma-esque instrumental song (instead of “Taiyou” for some reason, lol), but I’m pretty sure I’ve never heard it before. So it could be an instrumental from a future album. Hopefully I’ll remember enough to confirm it one day. I really liked the song.

There was this foreword from both Nagato-san and n-buna-san at the exhibition. Below the picture is the Google Translated version. Feel free to provide corrections in the comments if you're fluent.

Nagato-san's:

>We decided on the theme of ""sun"" and created works together. Yorushika produced music. I created a collage, and recorded the process on video and made a music video. The resulting image became the song's jacket.

>And we decided not to share each other's work until both of us had completed our works.

>I started with five images based on the word ""sun"" and the impression and experience I had had up until then. They were a flower wall intersecting starscape. It was big, bright, warm, burning in the middle, shining. Drawn by the image of such an abstract existence, I wandered around, cut paper, picked up the pieces, and pasted them. The shoot lasted more than 10 hours, and we created a total of five works, and said, ""Some of them were not completed on the spot and were completed later. I finished that day. A few days later, the idea of releasing the works I had created and recreating the image of the jacket came to me. I realized at that moment that this experiment ""sun"" would be completed by exhibiting it and letting everyone see it for themselves.

> In the end, the first time I heard Yorushika's ""Taiyou"" was when the MV edit was completed. It was somehow interestingly linked, but also very different. That's the image of ""Taiyou"" that Nagato and Yorushika had. I would be very happy if you enjoyed the collage and the song.

>Nagato Tetsuya

n-buna-san's:

>Nagato Tetsuya's work always has a vivid sense of floating. It's like improvised jazz, but at the same time there are times when you feel a calculated puzzle-like inevitability, and there are also moments when you can catch a glimpse of childlike innocence.

>The starting point of ""Taiyou"" was to see what differences we could see between Tetsuya Nagato and I when we shared the same theme and created two different works, music and graphics. Yorushika used music, and Nagato used pictures, each of us drawing a common theme as we pleased. We created each work without checking each other's work until it was completed. The two sets of ""suns"" that were created in this way are two lines that never overlap, yet somehow contain a number of mysterious commonalities.

# Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, Venue of Zense 2021 Live, Yokohama

Two days after, I went to Yokohama to visit Hakkeijima Sea Paradise theme park's Aqua Museum, the aquarium where they shot the Zense 2021 online concert. It was around 40-60 mins trip from Yokohama city center, and still a significant walk away from the theme park’s entrance. Hakkeijima Sea Paradise is located on Yokohama’s coast, so it was a lovely view.

Props to the cinematographer because when I arrived, the tank was underwhelmingly small compared to what I’d imagined from watching Zense 2021. I think I just stood there for an hour watching the fishes swim past while listening to Zense 2021. Just happened to stick around long enough for some lights and music show for the kiddos (I think it's called the ""Super Sardine Illusion"" performance?). They played this shoujo anime-esque song whilst the lights around the tank changed colors just like in the concert. Was pretty cool seeing the colors reflect off the fish scales (but tbh I was listening to Yorushika in my head, sorry to whatever song they played at the time).

If you're interested in going, this tank is in Zone 5/Labo 5, pretty deep inside the museum so just keep walking. You can see seals, walruses, penguins, and plenty of fishes on the way. Inside this ocean recreation, there's an escalator that goes up the tank so you can see the creatures from up close. You can see the tunnel for the escalator on the left side in the picture. Unfortunately I don't have pictures of it, only videos, and Reddit wouldn't let me upload it.

According to the park's website, apparently there are 50,000 sardines here (and if you're lucky like me, you might see the stingrays eat them).

# Zense 2024 Osaka Personal Recap

**\[Be warned, I tend to ramble a lot especially when I fangirl so I decided to put this last\]**

So! Is it weird that I went to the same city, same venue, to watch the same concert (slight difference in setlist) for the 2nd and 3rd time just short of 2 years after seeing it the first time? Maybe. I mean. I chose Osaka-jo Hall just because

1 -> Bigger venue = more tickets = more chances

2 -> I heard we were gonna be allowed to stand up. I'm short as heck (""Now I'm gonna have to pack platform shoes just in case ughhhh""). But Osaka-jo Hall has plenty of tiered seatings and the view is great from my Zense 2023 experience, so I had hoped I'd end up on the balcony seats. Nagoya's venue was flat as a board according to my research.

3 -> Though I wanted to see Pia Arena MM, I'd been to Japan in winter, but not autumn ... so Osaka it was.

No regrets ...

... other than the fact that they cut ""Shisouhan"" out of the 2024 setlist to replace it with ""Haru"" *sobs*

Couldn't they replace either ""Tada Kimi ni Hare"" or ""Ame to Cappuccino"" instead? ""Ame to Cappuccino"" is in all the digital-release concerts (Zense 2021, Gekkou Saien 2022, Tsuki Neko 2024, and the likely upcoming Zense 2024). ""Tada Kimi ni Hare"" is only exempt from Gekkou Saien 2022, and so is ""Haru Dorobou"" ... but y'all can't have the Haru Dorobou Corgi-chan on the concert poster without playing ""Haru Dorobou"". That's just ridiculous (yes I personally like it better than ""Tada Kimi ni Hare"" I'm sorry sue me).

I want the pop-rock PLUS string quartet version of ""Shisouhan"", okay? I want suis-san's angst delivery unleashed full power, live, recorded.

I did think they were definitely gonna put ""Haru"" in the new setlist. Just didn't expect I had to sacrifice ""Shisouhan"" for it.

You could see some preview pictures from ""Haru"", ""Kutsu no Hanabi"", ""Ame to Cappuccino"", ""Dakara Boku wa Ongaku wo Yameta"", and ""Haru Dorobou""'s lyrics video here on [this article](https://natalie.mu/music/news/603886).

And you can see some more pictures from ""[Dakara Boku wa Ongaku wo Yameta](https://www.instagram.com/assassin3120/p/DDmaDleSGK1/)"", ""[Parade](https://www.instagram.com/assassin3120/p/DDmZ9lKS8di/)"", and ""[Shikaki to Koohii](https://www.instagram.com/assassin3120/p/DDmZzGrSEzH/)""'s lyrics video on Instagram @ assassin3120 - This account belongs to Ichikawa Ryo-san, who was in charge for the lyrics video for those songs. Ichikawa-san went to Northern Europe (Amy's escape route) in July 2024 to shoot these lyrics video. Ichikawa-san [journaled about it here](https://note.com/assassin3120/n/n495ee79f5d30) (with some lovely pictures, check them out!).

Okay, I'm gonna try and be chronological. Ahem.

Day 1 was a bit chaotic for Overseas Ticket holders (aka me). There wasn't any announcement on where to go exactly. Unlike Pia Arena MM, there were THREE Ticket Information booths at Osaka-jo Hall. One in the North Gate, one in the East, and one in the South. Mind you, Osaka-jo Hall is a massive building (with 16,000 capacity). So not knowing which booth to go to for final ticket trade was confusing, especially once the masses began moving to queue for entry. I would've been lost without u/golden-sloth so thanks a lot!

You'd think if they open an Overseas Ticket sale they'd at least provide a sign in English telling you where to go to trade your final tickets.

Anyway! They checked my passport and email. All good, no prob. We started a bit late. First there was an announcement from staff, followed by suis-san's. Fortunately [fukai\_yoruno-san wrote down some of it on Twitter](https://x.com/fukai_yoruno/status/1868221962096386473) on their concert recap sketches, and this is what Google Translate coughed up:

>Thank you very much for attending Yorushika Live Tour 2024 ""Zense"". This is suis from Yorushika! Prior to the performance, it was announced that ""There is no problem with standing in the reserved seats at the venue. Also, shouting, clapping, and hand-clapping during the live performance are permitted."" It's been a while since we've had a live show since restrictions were lifted, and I'm really looking forward to it! When the intro starts, don't be intimidated, get excited! I look forward to enjoying a special evening with you all. First of all, please remain seated and wait. This has been suis from Yorushika!

[Zense 2024 Pre-Show Stage](https://preview.redd.it/vdrrd5avuz8e1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f3b22d5550609650d9e6730319a5c0cc497ffa9)

And suis-san really was excited. Couldn't stop skipping and moving around during the early numbers, twirling in her red skirt. She was adorbs, y'all! ""Makeinu"" and ""Itte"" was so full of high energy, I was surprised the audience got real quiet and sat down for ""Kutsu no Hanabi"" (was expecting people to stand and clap for that, ngl).

""Hitchcock"" had an awesome extended guitar outro! Looking forward to hear it again in the digital release.

Now disclaimer: I went to both Zense 2023 and Zense 2024. So I'm gonna end up doing some comparisons. There might be some bias because Zense 2023 was my first Yorushika offline live (and I'd thought it was gonna be my last) so it really amazed me that time, compared to the 2024 rerun. But I'm not saying I didn't have a blast in 2024. Cuz while some changes did sorta disappoint me, plenty others were more than pleasant.

I remember a particular instance in ""Rubato"". During the chorus, suis-san played the tambourine, clapping it on her hip. Before the second chorus, on the lyrics ""omae no zureta sensu wo baka ni shiten no sa"", on the 'omae' part (which means 'you'), she pointed the tambourine toward n-buna-san. The spotlight hit him, and he leaned back a bit like she just shot him lol. That was very cute I could've combusted.

And of course, ""Rubato"" got a trumpet and a saxophone player. And they deservedly got some solo moments allocated for them mid song. Was awesome. Not sure if it was just my ears, or if it really was some sort of mixing/sound engineering/speaker problem, but I had trouble listening to the different instruments. At some point there were a lot of them and I could barely hear the string quartet (later down the setlist). Like it was too much, yanno? So I'm reaaaalllyy excited for a digital release so I can hopefully enjoy it better on my headset.

""Rubato"" and ""Ame to Cappuccino"" were bridged by some drum beats, similar to how it was done between ""Bremen"" and ""Ame to Cappuccino"" in Tsuki Neko 2024. To be honest I was kinda disappointed because I think the arrangement for ""Bremen""-""Ame to Cappuccino"" from Zense 2023 was better. It involved other instruments than just the drums, and it was an arrangement I'd never heard before. When they played the intro for ""Bremen"" in Zense 2023, I'd thought they were gonna play ""Ame to Cappuccino"", only to be pleasantly surprised when ""Bremen"" then led up to that very song afterwards. Was excited to experience it again, but no luck unfortunately.

During the reading between ""Ame to Cappuccino"" and ""Usotsuki"", they draped this massive white curtain to cover the stage, leaving a very narrow space downstage for n-buna-san to sit and read. They projected the narration video on the curtain whilst the stage crews prepped the apartment set.

When the curtain lifted, there were all sorts of apartment furniture, distorted and in strange sizes. At the very back was a giant sofa, stuck between some distorted-looking giant bookshelves. Near the left wing was a giant cup of coffee. Sometimes they put dry ice out of the cup to make it look steaming. Very cute. There were two giant table-lamps near downstage, framing center stage, and there was a giant cup filled with giant pencils and pens. During ""Usotsuki"", there was a hanging lights/lamps from above, but they took it out as soon as the song was done and I wonder why that is. You can see the sketch of the stage on fukai\_yoruno-san's recap tweet I linked above.

I thought about the weird sizes of the furniture, and it made sense, considering that the protagonist >!lady had passed away and reincarnated as a corgi and then continued living with her husband. She had trouble with the memories of her past life getting mixed up with her current one. As a dog, most things would look bigger compared to a human's POV, right? Hence, the plot twist that the narrating lady character had been the reincarnated corgi all along.!< The story is the same as Zense 2023 so you can head to u/sgtfuzzy92's [post to read it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Yorushika/comments/10y4kzx/yorushika_zense_2023_tokyo_live_concert_report/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in the comments. Show 'em some love for that good ol' dedication!

I'm still partial to the Zense 2023 apartment set because of the way they frame the screen to look like a window and for the less cartoony feel of it. But ""Usotsuki"" was just as beautiful.

In my concert prep post I told y'all to 'definitely clap' during Song 5 (""Tada Kimi ni Hare"") and 'oh definitely clap' during Song 9. Pretty sure most of y'all figured out it was ""Wasurete Kudasai"" right away lol. Since the claps were such heavy feature of the song, I like to think the audience was practically also performers for that song. I remember the video lyrics was soft and pastel like, also with furniture disappearing with each clap.

""Hana ni Bourei"" had a lovely video about a memory of fireworks and festivals, very reminiscent of ""A Whisker Away"" and very nostalgic. I never cried to the song before, but I almost did to the lyrics video here.

Next, the most literally headbanging song, ""Haru""! I couldn't tear my eyes off Hacchan (Hirahata Tetsuya-san, the support keyboardist/pianist for Yorushika). He kept headbanging to the beat. I can confidently say that nobody had more fun than him during ""Haru"" in the entire tour. Watching him just made me so happy and energetic, I had to hold myself back from scream-singing along (because y'know courtesy, despite no restrictions) and had to remind myself to watch suis-san every now and then lol.

Speaking of her, BOY was the ""Haru"" acapella amazing live. Everyone went quiet. My heart raced, cheering her on, ""You can do it, suis-saaann!"". And I got goosebumps when she made it. I really like the lyric video, too! Could've sworn I found some HD pictures of the polar bear from the video somewhere online but idk where. I think it could've been Ichikawa-san's Instagram, but then he had to take them down? Darn it. Or perhaps I imagined it.

Now Toumin (I hope I'm not mix and matching my memories here) was very similar to the Zense 2021 arrangement. Which is, you know, breathtaking no complaints. But the highlight was, during the outro, suis-san went to take a nap on the giant sofa upstage. Climbed on and started yawning and stretching her arms, before laying down gently and staying there pretend-napping while n-buna-san read. A. Do. Ra. Ble. RRRAAHHH!

The next songs were ""Shikaki to Koohii"", ""Parade"" (surprisingly to me, people stood and clapped to this song), and ""Dakara Boku wa Ongaku wo Yameta"". This section is a complete flashback to the Elmy lore, especially in the lyrics video. Makes you wanna fly to Stockholm as soon as the show was done. No notes for them and ""Sayuumou"" (also cuz I don't remember anything wild from these 4 songs).

With the plot twist about Corgi-chan out of the way, we head to the climax of the show in ""Haru Dorobou"". Just like in Zense 2021, during the bridge (""kyou mou ai ni iku"" onwards), after each line, the spotlight shone on the musicians in turn for a short improv. Unfortunately, like in Tsuki Neko 2024, I feel like they played it rather safe. Cuz I definitely remember going wild inside when they showed off in Zense 2023.

This time, after the final strums of the bridge (right before ""ai wo utaeba kotoba tarazu""), the screen, which had been displaying leaves falling, suddenly went black. Except for a single leaf, gently floating. There was a total silence as suis-san waited for the leaf to land at the bottom of the screen, before resuming to the final pre-chorus. It was mesmerizing! And of course, like in Zense 2023, the moment the beat dropped, they released confetti shaped like crape myrtle from above. Gorgeous, 10/10, absolutely breathtaking, would recommend would do it again (and I did do it again, twice, hahaha).

[Zense 2024 Post-Show Stage](https://preview.redd.it/due8hji5vz8e1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2c65cb51a83f60f186ccc4d83f5bd5429c801d3)

Personally I thought that overall, suis-san's performance of the upbeat songs was much stronger on Day 1, while on Day 2 (the one recorded) she was stronger in the more mellow songs. But I probably won't notice anymore by the time it (hopefully) gets released. A little bit sad because I didn't get to see n-buna-san on mandolin though (someone who went to Kanagawa reported so, and I'm sure I didn't misremember this part about my experience).

The best part of Zense 2024 to me was all the new friends I made. So shoutout to Lee who sat next to me on Day 1 and hung out with me in Yokohama later on, RK who was willing to fangirl for an hour after a chance first encounter post-show Day 1 in the cold and dark of the park, Carr and Ivo who hung out with and helped me trade gacha pins on Day 2, and Haru who hung out with me on Day 2 and went out for oysters with me in Hiroshima! It was the first time I got to fangirl about Yorushika with someone irl without any need for the internet. And it was amazing. Very nice to meet y'all.

# Omake

Was chatting with u/tuandingkang after Day 1 and he said to me, ""Maybe they'll record it in Osaka, on Day 2"". And I was like, ""As if, they'd probably do it in Kanagawa. Besides, I haven't heard any notice about recording so they probably won't be doing that tomorrow.""

Tomorrow, Day 2. Me: ""OMG are those pro cameras??? Is that a freaking crane??? My cheers and clapping are gonna be in the recording? Waaaa ✨✨✨""

Any other non traditional post bacc premed students out there want to share how they prepared financially for this journey? Specifically how did you decide when you had the right financial situation to pursue this?

For context I am a high earner in tech and the primary financial provider for my family. I have one kid (under one year). I love my work and can keep doing it for a few more years while pivoting more fully into health tech so still relevant. I’m trying to decide what financial milestones I need to reach to confidently pursue my dream of becoming a doctor.

There is a world where I do a part time post bacc and work part time. And potentially  world where my glide year also involves tech work in cancer research.

I want to become a doc but I’m a little too far into life to go back to ramen and instant coffee days of undergrad and have too much responsibility to my family.
