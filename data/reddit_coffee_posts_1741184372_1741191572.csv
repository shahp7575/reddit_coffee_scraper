Love him or hate him, the guy has built multi-billion dollar companies that have literally transformed how we live, work, and dream about the future.

During one revealing interview, when asked about the secret behind his success, Musk dropped a surprisingly simple bombshell: **BIOGRAPHIES.**   
  
Yep, you read that right. The key to understanding world-changing success isn't some complicated algorithm or secret workshop—it's reading about the journeys of those who've already blazed the trail.

This isn't just Musk's quirk. It's the hidden playbook of **ultra-successful entrepreneurs worldwide**. Biographies are like time machines that let you download the wisdom, strategies, and mental frameworks of incredible founders without spending decades learning through painful trial and error!

Why are biographies so powerful? Because they do something textbooks and business courses can't:

* **They show the raw, unfiltered journey of real entrepreneurs**
* **Reveal the strategic thinking behind breakthrough moments**
* **Expose how successful people navigate seemingly impossible challenges**
* **Provide real-world mental models for problem-solving**

Reading biographies is like having a mentorship with the world's most successful entrepreneurs—except this mentorship costs less than a cup of coffee and can be accessed anytime, anywhere.

**Start reading BIOGRAPHIES**. I guarantee these stories will transform how you think about business, challenge, and success.

I was just wondering if anyone could give me a little bit of advice for me.

I started my gym journey last year at the weight of 90kg and now down to 69kg.

I want to continue to loose weight but gain muscle at the same time.

I don’t really know how many calories/ protein to be eating to achieve this. I would like to be 58kg by June.

I weight train between 3-5 times a week and try to do 10 thousand steps a day.

I also have started to take creatine once a day before my work out and have a black coffee to help with my energy boost.

I meal prep and eat mostly healthy meals with maybe 2 chest days a month. I drink occasionally.

My belly just does not seem to want to flatten.

I started Cpap journey back in June of 2024. I started out with the N30i from resmed. Typically, prior to Cpap, I breathe through my mouth at night and have a lot of difficulty breathing through my nose. However, I felt like it was so much easier to breathe with the mask. I had a one time adjustment of settings from my sleep doctor and I have had minimal issues since. My problem has become the mask. At first, the N30i seemed like I wasn’t getting enough air in my nose. So I tried p30i since they have the same frame but had trouble exhaling even with EPR on the highest setting. It gave me anxiety so I went back to N30i and had my doctor make those adjustments that I mentioned. I loved sleeping with the cpap! I was able to quit taking naps and drinking coffee. But within the past month, I have had nothing but problems. I keep opening my mouth at night. I either wake up from the noise or my husband does. He’s a very deep sleeper so you know it’s bad if it’s waking him up. I tried the P30i again but still hated it (don’t get me started on the whistling noise from my nose in that one!). So then I did N30i with the chin strap. It either hurt my jaw or I was still opening my mouth 🙄. So I bought F30i but it seems like it blasts a lot of air out of the front? I did change the machine to full face mask but it made no difference. I keep waking up from hearing the air on my blankets or feeling it on my arms 😭 I know I am being picky but hoping someone can suggest a mask to me so I can go back to loving my cpap. Any thoughts on F20? Side note: mouth taping is not really an option for me as I believe it will cause me anxiety and I have read it is not recommended. I will be reaching out to my sleep doctor in case it is the settings too so no worries there!",1,1741191187.0,SleepApnea,0,1.0,False

1j46ney,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAFS_TV/comments/1j46ney/unpopular_opinion_i_think_madison_and_david_could/,Unpopular Opinion:  I think Madison and David could last.,"**Madison and David:** I don't think that their coupling was just the excitement of an illicit relationship, or just because they both weren't happy with their matches.

I think they have a real chance of staying together.  For reasons we might not understand, she sees something in him. Maybe it's potential.  Maybe it's just that she doesn't really care what he does for a living, where he's living.  Maybe she's perfectly okay having him move in with her.

I think she's still trying to play the ""boundaries"" game for the camera and act like their coupling is brand new and they weren't doing anything before the ""I like you more than I should.""  I would bet the ""I love yous"" happened a long time before what we saw.

They seem to light up around each other and I **don't think it's just a physical thing or it would've fizzled out by now.**

**Michelle:**  I wish instead of pretending like David ultimately had a shot and the door was open for him and that the would ""probably have gotten a divorce.""  **She would've been better off continuing to hammer home that Michelle and Madison were friendly (after party she said they got close during the honeymoon) and that being the betrayal she was most angered by and acknowledge that she was NOT going to stay with David.**  Or that she was angry for Allen because both of them betrayed him.  I think her acting like she was more victimized by David when she couldn't stand him doesn't really land.  We all can understand why she felt betrayed by a friend and that David was lying all the time too, but pretending he had a chance is as big a lie as David saying he was texting about food. **I also wish** ***all of them*** **would've called bullshit right then and there that they were only platonic and ended their marriages before being a couple.**

**Allen:**  Allen, I love you.  But no one needed to hear that you were exploring freaky shit.  Just say that you weren't ready for a relationship so you got on Tinder and was hooking up and then realized you're not a hook up guy.  We didn't need details.

**Emem:** I don't know the timeline of when they started dating or when the engagement reveal was -- was it a long time after DD?  Whatever the case, I don't understand either one of them rushing into it an engagement (and I think she's married now).  **I can understand both of them talking about building a future but I'd be a little concerned at a man not even divorced yet proposing.**  I know they've known each other since middle school, but that doesn't mean they \*know\* each other.  I hope that what we're seeing was like a year later (someone said this season was filmed in 2023?) Unless the timeline is that they've been dating for almost a year after, I don't get the rush esp since he was already going through a divorce..

**Ikechi:**  ""Plug and play husband.""  **Sir, you tried to get on MAFS before you got on MAFS.**  You are the last person that should make a PNP comment.

**Juan/Karla:**  Good for her in saying no to coffee and friendship. I truly believe she did develop feelings for him, but unlike that Kristen from several seasons ago who kept on hanging on to that crunchy granola dude even after DD, she has enough confidence in herself that she knows better.  Let him cogitate on what he missed out on with her.  **He did look a bit shocked and a little crushed about her not wanting to be friends.**",1,1741191143.0,MAFS_TV,0,1.0,False

When Cindy was still little, her Father left them, which lead to serious struggles for Rosie. Rosie just had a part-time job in the local Grocery Store, which had to be enough to live from now!

Growing up without a father, Cindy developed some serious issues, especially Anger Issues, which unfortunately even lead to her dropping out from High School recently! But to help her Mother, she works now in the mornings as a Barista in the Coffee Shop down the road.

Rosie became very gloomy and developed depression, when her ex-husband left them a few years ago. But the band between Rosie and Cindy is very strong!

Thanks to Cindy's Job now aswell, they were able to secure a small loan to buy an old, run-down House in Evergreen Harbor! So far they only were able to live in a tiny, filthy apartment where they even had to share the bedroom!

It's a very old house, which will need a lot of work and money to fix up. But both have their own bedroom now! Rosie has a small room + bathroom in the basement, because she wanted to have Cindy the bigger bedroom + bathroom upstairs.

Rosie also has a secret passion; she loves cooking! She even sells food now sometimes to the neighborhood, which brings in a little extra money aswell. Even Nancy Landgraab (and a Werewolf!) are regular customers to enjoy one of Rosie's Cakes or Stews from time to time!

It won't be easy, but Rosie and Cindy are very happy now. The house is not much, but it's their own home now, which nobody will take away from them again. 

But who knows what the future for Cindy looks like? Even if Cindy dropped out of High School, she also shares the passion for cooking, just like her Mother Rosie.

1j46hsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1j46hsw/3_years_and_discarded/,3 years and discarded,"Hello I had to share this as I just don’t know what to do anymore.

So back in November 2021 I was married unhappily and was very close to my work colleague I will refer to her as “A” we were best friends she was engaged again unhappily . On a night out we ended up crossing the line and kissing this then led to a full affair . We both intially said it was just fun and we wouldn’t ever ask each other to leave the other partner . This got more and more intense I became jealous she would still sleep with her fiancé and she would be jealous of me spending time with the wife . Eventually both partners found out my wife left me and I hate myself genuinely 
For what I did to her I’ll never forgive myself for hurting her. 

Over the next 3 years …. Yes 3 years me and A were on and off I would ask her to leave her ex and she would initially just treat me as a her bit on the side . As the years went on she would go on to leave her ex but not move out of the house still coming back to me a total of 11 times bouncing back to a relationship with her ex (the excuse for this was always to keep her family together) she would lie to him every day about me telling him that she either didn’t see me or that when she was out for the night or late home from work she would be at her female friends . She was actually in bed with me . 

This continued on and off she would block me I’d reach out she would unblock me say how I stressed her out because of me been so paranoid about her sleeping in bed with her ex and in effect being with me I can’t lie due to the amount she would break things off with me and go back to her ex it caused major anxiety for me and caused me to overthink every little moment she would go quiet or stop showing feelings .

We eventually got into a relationship in 2024 she still hadn’t moved out of the house with her ex neither had he. I’d like to point out at one point she even went away on a spa weekend with her ex and told me not to worry as they are just friends . this built up to a blow out argument in August 2024 where she again kicked me to the kerb as she made plans to spend time with her and her family began to go quiet then suddenly didn’t want me in her plans despite taking time off from work to spend this time with her . She said like what would always happen she needed some space and time alone … she broke up with me then despite saying she would never go back , you guessed it went back to him the ex.

October 2024 she unblocks me makes contact after I ask via a mutual friend for some details of something she knew and I needed them . She unblocks me tells me how much she hates me this goes on for few days before it turns to how much she has missed me but she can’t cope with my overthinking which has stemmed from her always picking me up and dropping me. As the days went on we met and agreed to try again she had to tell her ex it was over again and finding out yet again she had been sleeping with him made me feel physically sick but she maintained she didn’t have feelings for him anymore … so I jumped on the cycle again for another go. 

Things this time started to go well again she began to look at buying a new house and eventually agreed on a new home and to be bought out by her ex. On December 19th she began to become distant again from 3/4 calls a day lots of memes shared and messages it was no calls little messages I began to know again something was wrong . December 23rd we had a day planned together but she didn’t turn up at the time agreed and messaged me at 3pm that day that she had just woken up because she had been sat drinking with her ex at home till 4am was way too hungover  . She agreed to meet me for 40 mins for a coffee… where I told her I wasn’t happy again she turned it around about how stressed she was getting trying to keep her ex happy her daughter happy and “fit in” time with me. Christmas came and went with minimal contact . And Boxing Day came the punch again she was due to spend the day with me she didn’t arrive untill are 4pm and immediately I could tell something was wrong . We exchanged gifts then she hit me with “I’ve got alot going one with the house my daughter and everything I haven’t got the time to give you what you want so I need time to just sort all this then we can try again, she added don’t worry my feelings haven’t changed” 

New Year’s Day 2025 I messaged her the night before to say happy new years she didn’t reply untill 1pm New Year’s Day with “hi happy new year … look I’m doing so well feel so less stressed without you that I think we should just be friends “ 

Needless to say I lost my mind and went berserk I know this isn’t the right response but again feel like I was lied to about how she felt and that she knew I wanted so much more and a family together. She blocked me and eventually opened back up a few days ago to say she’s moved out of the house with her ex into a female friends house and met someone new works at the same company we do and she’s really happy with him and sees her future with him. I cried on the phone to her and said I want you back I need you . She replied I don’t love you anymore but I’ll always care about you we won’t ever get back together.

I feel …. Destroyed I can’t get the thought of her happy out of my head … I can’t get the feeling like I was used over and over by the woman I had in my head an heart as my “one” why couldn’t she leave her ex and give me the freedom of not having to have her live with another man but can for this new guy less than 60 days after saying she needs to be alone ? I feel like I’ve lost a piece of me and I can’t stop the cycle of anxiety and anger. 

I have gone no contact now i can’t bare to see her happy with someone else . I’m struggling so hard to see my own worth and realise what’s been actually happening to me for 3 years despite all my friends telling me how she was doing this to me allowing me to build a relationship with her daughter and now leave me like this . 

I know she’s a narcissist , an avoidant and has monkey branched to the next person that has shown her attention , she would entertain multiple men in her inboxes showing her interest even before I came along 

What on earth do I do now …. I’m laughing at writing this as I’ve never posted nothing before and my gramma is shit but I wana know the consensus

1j46hs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j46hs6/is_it_worth_trying_anything/,Is it worth trying anything,"I believe I know the answer to this, but I think external perspective would be good. Last year I was heavily involved with someone, but for various reasons we never became a couple and she inevitably ghosted me. We didn’t talk over the summer and then I went abroad for a semester. I’m back now and literally see her almost everywhere I go, but it’s a college campus so what do you expect. I just find it so odd how I keep running into her in places where there aren’t a ton of people (I saw her again yesterday in a secluded spot of the library). I texted her last week abt maybe getting together for coffee (no romantic intent, just to catch up) and she responded saying she thought it wasn’t a good idea and she was seeing someone. The iffy thing to me is that I saw her on tinder a few days ago. 

She made me so happy and she’s beautiful. When we were whatever it was we were, everyone who saw us together said we were cute together and there was a spark. I personally feel like I was mistreated at the end because she began to distance, get cold, breadcrumb, then I only ever got an answer to any of this after I brought it up, after which she said “I want you as a friend because I’m not ready for another relationship right now and want to work on myself”. Again this was abt a year ago so things have changed I’m sure. 

I’m already upset so I want to leave it, but a part of me wants to say something. For those who think I should leave it, how would you suggest I try to move on? I’m heavily involved in school, extracurriculars, and I’m trying to work, but that’s its own story. I’m trying to get back out and date but I’ve had such a hard time even getting people to respond, let alone go on a date. It feels like I’ve a hex on me.",1,1741190746.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Looking up upon the starry sky, made me thankful for another day of being Super Earth's citizen and a child of liberty and freedom. The sound of fireworks going off in the distance and lighting up the sky in a bright and vibrant color. Accompanied by the roaring of the crowds surrounding me. The trail of fire that rained down to the ground warms my heart with such a beautiful sight. A sight that I have a privilege to see before I closed my eyes.

CHAPTER 1

I woke up in my government issued apartment, on my comfortable bed. My automated alarm clock went off, a jarring beep jolted insistently through my room, prompting me to get up. My shutters automatically opened letting the bright and warm sunlight inside. I stretched myself before I got up and turned off my alarm then walk towards my bathroom, washing myself of oil and dirt. Yesterday was rough, we have to double our production and put in mandatory overtime to meet the demanding quota. I don't mind working extra, it gives me more credits so I can work toward getting my request for a pet goldfish approved. Frankly speaking, I enjoyed doing overtime, for serving Super Earth is its own reward.

I put on my standard issue Super Earth blue jumpsuit, drank my stale coffee that I made yesterday. Another hefty stretch before I walked towards the door and opened it. The whirling sound of the motor hummed quietly before the door opened with a distinct \*hiss\* sound. A sound that I've heard a thousand times since I've been sent to this colony. I can see other loyal citizens of Super Earth getting out of the door. For each one I walked past, I greeted them with a smile and they return them, accompanied by all the overheard morning conversations and laughter filling the hallway.

Just a few strides before I was out from the apartment, a dazzling and bright golden ray from the sun shined onto my face. ""Another day of liberty and Freedom!"" I thought to myself before I walked toward the weapon factory.

As I strolled down the well-maintained, smooth asphalt sidewalk lined by a row of neat and compact shrubs, I took time to admire my surroundings. The quiet residential area to my left with strong and sturdy single story terrace houses surrounded by impenetrable walls were shaded with evergreen trees. At the end of the fork in the road, I slowed my pacing in front of the public park. The lush greenery of the open and green space accompanied by meticulously paved walkways and a chorus of playful shouts from children of freedom always brings a slight grin to my face.

""I am proud of being a part of Super Earth!"" This thought ran through my head daily. Not a moment before I was greeted with a heroic statue of Super Earth's finest, the Helldiver, standing tall in front of the factory, shadowing over me, protecting me, protecting us.

I pulled out my identity card placing it onto the panel by the door to scan it before the sliding bypass door opened, letting me inside. Today, we have to start the shift in a rush because of the double production quota. Super Earth needs a surplus of weaponry to fill the ranks of her newly trained SEAF troopers, which we gladly provided.

The whole factory was filled with a cacophony of machinery, working tirelessly to cut, weld and assemble carbon steel together to make battle-ready rifles. My job is to inspect any rifles that were passed onto the conveyor belt by the assembly machine looking for defected ones.  Thanks to our mandatory youth camp weapon training program, I can inspect them with quickness and precision. Especially when our supervisor is keeping his keen eyes on us.

""Hey, have you heard about the attack on the nearby system?"" My co-worker strike a conversation with another beside him.

""Yes, I heard it was a Terminid farm outbreak. But I think the Helldivers already took care of them, 'else we'd hear it from the news!"" The other co-worker replied.

""Heh, yeah. They'd never let us down, they always get the job done even before we know it."" I tell them with a smile on my face. ""They're the true patriots of Super Earth"" before I saluted with my right hand.

""Hey keep working!"" Our manager yelled down from the overhead balcony. We had to keep our head down and our hands busy with the gun but a brisk moment of eye contact that was made between us made time stopped for a second, only for it to resumed by our shit-eating grin and giggles.  
.

.

.

Long and grueling hours have passed, multiple boxes sealed and packed meticulously that lined the cargo bay of the transport aircraft, were ready to be sent to the SEAF armory. Although it was late into the night, our work was not done yet as we still have to meet our quota before the night passes. But not before we take a mandatory 30 minutes break. I'll take that time for the opportunity to contact my family on the other side of the galaxy. I scanned my Super Credit code onto the long-distance communication device in the canteen.

I dialed in the number of my family's communication device code and the screen lighted up ""Attempting to connect..."" a long pause...

""Bzzz hissss bzzzz....."" followed by constant static crackle ""Sorry, we encounter a communication problem, please try again later. Your super credit will be deducted for the attempt"" the screen goes dark, reflecting my image like a mirror.

""Damn it, the communication tower has to be down again! Last time it was down for a whole week, those guys can't even do their job properly even after the replacement."" I let my thoughts out.

So I decided to grab calamari for dinner tonight, luckily it only costed a few requisitions and I have 20 minutes left on my break.

For just a moment before I'd almost finished with my meal, the bell rung, signaling for us to return to work.

.

The shift continued as usual, it was the same routine that I did a hundred of times today. As I inspected a faulty rifle I could hear a static chatter from the security guard's short-wave radio. I glanced over and covertly eavesdropped on the conversation out of curiosity.

""Come again, over."" He answered, pause and repeat ""Command, come again, over"" a persistent hissing sound that occasionally popped with faint chatter could be heard from his radio. He turned pale, sweat pooling up on his forehead, his hand shaken and he once again pushed the radio button and asked ""Confirmed? Over."" The voice from the radio answered ""Confirmed. Over."" He looked up, making eye contact with me before he unholstered his P-2 Peacemaker pistol.

""Alright people, time to wrap this up. We got a situation here!"" He bellowed out, getting all the attention from the workers through all the machinery noises.

A distant rumbling noise can be heard from the outside, shaking the factory.

""Shut them down, we have to go!"" He shouted ""Get your essential items and follow m-"" His sentence got cut short from the sudden blackout. The room went silent. An uncanny stillness hung in the air to the point that I could hear the sound of my own sweat-drops.

The bombardment of rumbling continued, stirring the ground beneath us.

The emergency light turned on and filled the room with a glaring red light. The siren announced themselves blaring ear-splitting noises. Our attention was then all drawn to the sound of strained grunts that quickly ended into a dissonance of screaming. The security guard had his pistol drawn and took aim at the entrance. I could see that he is visibly shaking, I was shaken up too.

This moment seemed like an eternity until a galloping-like heavy thumping sound can be heard from the outside, before something suddenly burst through the thick concrete wall, leaving a trail of dust and debris behind, prowling through all of our equipment and assembly line. Sounds of gun shots rang out. The muzzle flash lighted up the room like a spark for a mere moment, a mere moment too short to make anything out. I duck and dive to the left, narrowly avoiding the huge incoming silhouette, the security guard wasn't so lucky as I saw him got launched into the air like nothing. In a panic, I crawled my way under a conveyor belt hoping to find a hiding spot, luckily, I found one. I opened the maintenance hatch on the floor and crawled inside, praying and hoping to survive.

The sounds of blood curdling screaming, crying, roaring, growling, slashing and smashing can be heard from the outside, erratic thuds of footsteps raced each other towards the exit combined with skittering of a hundred if not a thousand legs echoing through the factory. I curled up and listen to their screams ringing through my skull. I cried, not because I'm scared but because I'm a coward, I can't help them. I am not a Helldiver.

1j46h08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1j46h08/does_anyone_else_prefer_traditional_hymns_and/,Does anyone else prefer traditional hymns and services?,"Hello,

When I moved home I started going to a liberal modern church with modern hymns and rewriting inclusive traditional hymns and I tried to stick with it but realised it was not for me and I felt like a lot of the modern hymns where very sunday school like a could have been writen for children and very basic with ""catchy tune"". I then found a little Presbyterian church with traditional services and hymns and I was at home! The liberal church was full of students and young people where as the little Presbyterian church is mainly elderly to very elderly woman.
Befor leaving the liberal church I was made a member, they asked me to pick a hymn for membership service so I selected ""oh happy day that fixed my choice on thee my Saviour and my God!"" and I was advised that hymn was not appropriate and was too evangelical...

My old church befor I moved was a Presbyterian polity reformed church with traditional hymns.
I love low church traditional protestant services, non regular communion with a said/sung benediction at the end. Hymn writers such as Fanny Crosby, Charles Wesley and many other great hymn writers in my mind are more focused on the glory of Gods love, Christs death and resurrection with beautiful words and tunes that don't feel like pop music.

I feel like the currant oppinion is that a church shouldn't look like a church... pews are replaced with stackable chairs, pulpit is redundant, hymn books replaced with a power point screen... in my mind a church should look like a church not a coffee shop as cafe church seems to be a popular thing for churches to have in the UK instead of normal church service.

Unfortunately I strongly belive 90 percent of your little traditional non conformist churches/chapel in the UK will die as young people have no interest in sitting in a pew, listening to the word of the lord and singing traditional hymns like their fore fathers did befor them. 

Sorry for mini rant I'm autistic, very set in my ways and probably one of few people who prefer what they grew up with even though im only 26 😅

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

*In a shifting cashless society where* ***70% of all U.S. transactions are made via credit or debit cards***, CenterCheck has built ***the most comprehensive, high-frequency, and statistically reliable*** retail data platform in the U.S. by leveraging anonymized card transaction data at scale.   
  
The traditional models—government surveys, merchant-reported sales, or self-reported consumer spending—come with time lags, incomplete data, and heavy reliance on estimation. CenterCheck’s approach is different. By capturing actual consumer spending from 70% of all card-based transactions in the U.S., CenterCheck’s analytics provide a real-time, store-level, and category-wide view of retail performance unmatched by any other source.

# The Shift to a Cashless Economy: Why Transaction Data is the Future of Retail Analytics

For decades, retail analysts relied on a mix of Census Bureau retail reports, store foot traffic studies, and merchant-reported sales to gauge economic activity. But as America moves rapidly toward a cashless economy, older measurement tools are becoming less reliable.  
  
A 2024 Federal Reserve study found that credit and debit cards now account for over 60% of all payments in the U.S., while cash usage has fallen below 16%—a dramatic shift from just a decade ago. Additionally, card transactions account for 84% of the growth in all non-cash payments since 2018, meaning retail’s trajectory is now largely defined by electronic payment data.  
  
This shift is why CenterCheck’s methodology is uniquely positioned to provide the most statistically significant insights into U.S. retail trends. With access to billions of anonymized transactions, CenterCheck captures the full scope of consumer activity in near real-time, without the estimation errors of traditional models.

# Timely Retail Sales Tracking From Card Transaction Data

Can transaction data truly reflect the broader U.S. retail economy? The answer, based on multiple independent studies, is a resounding **yes**. In Spain, BBVA researchers found that card transaction data closely mirrored the country’s official Retail Trade Index, capturing both national and regional trends with near-identical precision. Similarly, Mastercard’s SpendingPulse reports, which estimate total retail sales using credit card data, have consistently matched U.S. Census retail reports—often publishing their estimates weeks ahead of official government data.  
  
CenterCheck’s approach—using aggregated credit/debit transaction data—produces results that are as accurate as government statistics, but with greater speed and granularity. **Competitive Benchmarking: Measuring Sales Performance at a Store and Market Level**One of the most powerful applications of CenterCheck’s platform is its ability to benchmark retailers against competitors at a granular level.

* **Real estate developers** use CenterCheck’s data to assess how different shopping centers and retail corridors perform.
* **Retailers** use it to track store-level revenue growth vs. industry averages.
* **Investors** analyze sector-wide trends, spotting shifts in consumer spending habits ahead of earnings reports.

Unlike broad government reports that only provide total retail sales, CenterCheck drills down into performance at the store and city level. Want to know how a specific shopping center is performing? How one coffee chain stacks up against another in revenue per store? CenterCheck can provide those answers with unprecedented detail.   
  
**Growing Accuracy via Modern Payments**  
  
The fundamental shift to cashless payments has made credit and debit card data substantially more representative of the sales history of physical businesses, resulting in a reliability that will only increase over time.  
  
CenterCheck’s methodology incorporates billions of anonymized transactions covering over 70% of all card-based consumer spending, into a simple top use interface. Savvy retailers, real estate investors, brokerages and economic analysts alike are making use of CenterCheck’s next generation insights. In a rapidly changing consumer economy, those who rely on outdated, slow-moving data risk falling behind.",1,1741190371.0,CenterCheck,4,1.0,False

McDonald’s, unlike Tim Hortons has designated parking stalls for you to wait for your pick up order. They have stall number one stall number two stall number three etc.

Tim Hortons on the other hand only has a parking lot with no places to actually wait.

How to Pinpoint Stress Triggers Using Just Your iPhone,"A mid-afternoon spike in anxiety isn’t random—it’s a pattern. Hidden within your daily routine are subtle triggers influencing your mood, from back-to-back meetings to a missed lunch. The good news? You don’t need a smartwatch or wearables to track them. Your iPhone already holds the data you need.



# 1. Use Calendar Data to Spot Stressful Time Blocks

Your schedule tells a story. If anxiety consistently hits around the same time, look at your calendar:

* Do you have a recurring meeting that drains your energy?
* Is this right after a high-pressure deadline?
* Are you consistently overbooked without breaks?

Tracking your emotional state alongside your calendar events can highlight which commitments are causing tension.

# 2. Track Location to Identify Environmental Triggers

Your surroundings play a role in your stress levels. Your iPhone’s location history (found in Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services > Significant Locations) can reveal patterns:

* Does anxiety peak when you’re at a certain place, like your office or a crowded coffee shop?
* Are you commuting or running errands at this time?

If certain locations correlate with stress, making small changes—like taking a different route or adjusting your schedule—could help.

# 3. Use Screen Time to Monitor Digital Triggers

Excessive screen time—especially on certain apps—can contribute to stress. Check your iPhone’s Screen Time data (Settings > Screen Time) to see if:

* Anxiety spikes after scrolling social media.
* Work emails dominate your downtime.
* You spend long periods on news apps before stress kicks in.

Setting app limits or scheduling downtime could help you regain control.

# 4. Maintain a Reflective Journal

Documenting your thoughts and feelings provides deeper insight into your emotional patterns. Regular entries can help you identify:

* **Emotional Triggers**: Specific situations or interactions that precede anxiety episodes.
* **Physical Symptoms**: Noticing bodily responses, such as increased heart rate or tension.
* **Utilize Health Features**: Use apps to log moods and assess mental well-being.

Over time, this practice can highlight recurring themes, enabling you to develop personalized coping strategies.



# Taking Proactive Steps

Understanding the root of your mid-afternoon anxiety empowers you to make meaningful changes. Whether it's adjusting your daily routine, setting digital boundaries, or creating a more soothing environment, your iPhone serves as a valuable tool in this journey.

The vision board scene is so hard to watch, every time. It's interesting that after that, she leaves his house and goes home and then goes back out to go to Kim's house, Holly's ex with the boat (who I thought was Holly the first time I saw the photo in the mirror.) In the one scene leads to another thing, I think it's interesting that the thing with Joel sent her to Kim, she's looking for someone that feels like she does, that's grieving and lost, and Kim isn't. She's good. 

They are never going on a boat ride.

Then that scene sends her back to Joel's to apologize. Again, had she not done that they probably never would have gotten past that, they were just barely in at that point. She's so broken, they never really get into why that is, altho i think her mom has a lot to do with it, telling the therapist ""She's the pretty one"" and no one in the family thinks to even protest or raise an eyebrow. Her self esteem is so low it is non-existant. It extends into every part of her, she doesn't think she can sing, doesn't think anyone would be her friend, god forbid anything more than that. Her family kinda hates her, except for her dad and niece.

It's not an abusive or toxic situation. It's more that I've dealt with poor mental health for a long time and I accepted a lot of help from him/. And over the years it's culminated in me feeling extremely infantile. It's not just his fault, I didnt see it happening, but when I'm with him, I feel like a stupid little girl. I'm 30 for context, he is 32. 

I've realised with the state of my mental health I really cant be the person he wants me to be. I really should not ever have children, which is his ultimate wish. I thought I wanted them too, but I dont think I can. I cant stand the thought of having that responsibility 24/7. I cant stand the thought of having to touch someone so constantly. I cant deal with any of it.

I need to end this relationship but I'm too weak. I dont want to break his heart. I do love him but Im not in love with him. I dont want to feel like I'm not good enough anymore. I dont want to be told ""ARFID doesnt exist, it's just picky eating"" or ""what are you depressed about, you have such a cushy life."" He doesnt mean it when he says these things, he's just out of ideas on how to deal with me. This is the man who picks up my scripts, buys me coffee pods before I've realised I'm running out, leaves his last cig on my desk for me when he leaves for work. That's what makes it so hard. He does everyhting for me. I mean everything and anything and I dont even have to ask. But I cant deal with the way he talks to me.

I moved to his country to be with him and he's told me before he'll put me on the plane back. He never references me being foreign, and when I say ""In my country we do X"" I get told ""But you're in the UK now."" Whenever I accidentally speak in my native language he looks at me with disgust, asking me ""what are you even saying?"" 

I still feel like I owe him. He's helped me with so many things. And I've not been a great girlfriend in return. He's been on the hook for all the housework for long stretches of time. While he does everything for me, I dont do anything back like what he does. I dont do big gestures, I show my love only in small ways and verbally, but it's what he wants. He's taken me on surprise dates, given me gifts that I never would have bought for myself, and I never reciprocated that. So I dont feel like I'm allowed to end this.

We were just about to start looking to go on holiday together for the first time, now that we can afford it etc. He's been wanting this forever and now we can finally do it. He'll hate me for that cause without me, he could've traveled. I've wasted years of his life. He wants kids so badly, he is 32 and already feels like he's late. And he'll never see this coming. It's going to be terrible. 

  
Please help me. I dont know what I need to hear. I dont really have anyone to turn to IRL cause I only know all my friends through him and while they would support me, I'm just embarrassed. Same with my family. I feel like the biggest failure. I feel like I'm ruining everything. Sorry if this makes no sense",1,1741189173.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Seeing how glennfk is allergic to seafood, this could have ended badly, hence the clickbait title 😉. Who'd of thought, when ordering a random menu, you'd have gotten 2 of the same one you're allergic too! Crazy! I sent him 2 different Norwegian.

Anyway, this thing was pretty darn good just like all the Norwegian rations I've had.

The main got split into two portions; the pic is the entire main dish (600 calories),  I only ate half of it at a time though. I did add some Frank's red hot to this (not pictured) even though it didn't come with any hot sauce; that elevated this dish to a whole new level and cut the creaminess of it a bit. 

My kid loved the Not (Nut?) Creme, it's like nutella but way better. He just ate it right out of the pouch.

Biscuits were broken badly and were inadvertently dumped all over the floor after taking that pic...D'OH! I can attest from others I've had, these are good biscuits!

The beverage base was perfect, no clumping at all and tasted great! So far, I've only had the lemon one in every ration!

The blueberry bar was dense and nice to chew on. Coffee and gum were great too. Don't see coffee too often in the case I have so that was a nice touch. 

Thanks Glennfk!

Take care folks!

1j45pz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1j45pz2/my_top_5_absolute_worst_tropes_in_creepypasta_1/,My Top 5 Absolute Worst Tropes in Creepypasta (1 and 2 are genuinely really important),"These are tropes that break immersion, come across as corny, kill the suspense, or even spread harmful stereotypes. If anything, at least read the last two since they're really important.

**5. Leaving too much of the story ""up to interpretation"".** This is a major problem you see in SCP articles, where almost every detail about a monster or object is censored. Sure, the oldest fear is that of the unknown, but the unknown is scarier when you have a point of reference. Instead of something being completely unknowable, give the audience something to work with. A good example is SCP-294 (the coffee machine that dispenses anything) and how when asked for a cup of ""anti-water"", the machine said ""OUT OF RANGE"", giving the audience information about how the machine works while also adding to the mystery of how the universe(s) that SCP takes place in works.

**4. ""If you're reading this...""** I'm sure you've all read Creepypastas told from the first-person perspective as if it was by someone recounting an event, only to realize that the events and logic of the story would make it impossible to write the story as a first-person recount. There's a great creepypasta that still has this trope called ""If You're Armed at the Glaremont Metro, Please Shoot Me"" which follows a man who, following a pharmaceutical trial, starts to experience time slower and slower. He describes every second as an eternity, where blinking becomes ""millions of years of darkness"". Just one problem: if every split-second feels like eons, why would he type out the entire story on his phone? If you want to write your story in First-Person and have something bad happen to your protagonist, do what ""Ted the Caver"" did where the medium of the story allowed the writer to say, ""I'm going to go back for my camera, but it's going to be dangerous"", and then he stopped updating.

**3. Hyperrealistic Eyes.** We all know this one. ""I was watching an episode of 'Clutch Cargo' and while the realistic mouths were nothing new, the characters all had hyperrealistic eyes"". It's an aesthetic thing that only works in a visual medium. Part of why this trope and lost-episode creepypastas most of the time tend to fall flat is that it's way scarier to just see something for yourself rather than hearing it be described to you. 

**2. Teenage ""Psychopaths"".** Now we're getting into tropes that can cause genuine harm. In the current zeitgeist, ""psychopath"" has just become a catch-all term for someone who has some unspecified (or largely misunderstood) mental illness that seemingly makes them unhinged and/or dangerous. In reality, mental illnesses have a ton of nuance and complexity behind them, and people with mental health issues are actually more likely to be the victims of violent crimes than be perpetrators. ""Psychopathy"", more accurately Antisocial Personality Disorder in the DSM-5, in reality, isn't some ""horror superpower""; it's a complex condition that doesn't automatically make someone a sadist or a serial killer, most people with ASPD just struggle with empathy, forming social attachments, and in some cases following the law (one of the diagnostic criteria is a history of trouble with the law). And making characters teenagers or adolescent characters ""psychopaths"" undermines another bit of diagnostic criteria: you have to be at least 18 for it to be ASPD. I will say that while I don't like how the character Ticci Tobi is just a mixed bag of random mental disorders that are meant to make him scary, I do respect the author's decision to remove the story from the Wiki after they felt that it was leading people to romanticize mental illness. In short, this trope is harmful since not only does it implicitly demonize or even romanticize mental illness, it also has the effect of glorifying violence perpetrated by youth.

  
**1. (and this is a really important one) Using words and names that belong to sacred practices and traditions without regard for cultural significance.** In the Indigenous folklore of the North American Plains and Great Lakes, there is a spirit called the ""Wndigo"" (censored for cultural sensitivity) which is a spirit of greed, cannibalism, and the breaking of a moral taboo during hardship. But in the cultural zeitgeist, ""Wndigo"" just means ""big humanoid monster with a deer's head"". This strips the creature of its cultural meaning and is especially problematic considering that this culture is very much still alive even after (and during) colonial erasure. Another example is how in Navajo folklore, there are witches who use dark magic and are a twisted inversion of the morals that the Navajo people hold. These witches are called ""sknwlkers"" (again, censored for cultural sensitivity), and most importantly, talking about them is very taboo amongst the Navajo people. But for whatever reason, any story involving an uncanny shapeshifting cryptid uses the word ""sknwlker"". I get it, it sounds way cooler than just ""shapeshifter"", but it's appropriation and misuse nonetheless. Many Indigenous communities have specifically spoken out against the misuse of these terms. If you want to write a story about a deer-headed humanoid, call it a weredeer. If you want to write a story about shapeshifting cryptids, call it a fleshgait. But leave sacred traditions out of it.",1,1741188737.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

If my approach doesn’t agree with you, I would kindly ask to either politely disagree or simply scroll past.

Fadi started his morning set with uplifting vocal melodies accompanied by a breaky bass. He enriched this dreamy soundscape with some groovy upper frequencies, funky snares and hi hats started stirring the floor. The speed was matching the hypnotic energy at approximately 133 bpm, he took some time to set the mood before venturing into darker waters. 

As he brought up the speed gradually, the sound design made way for a more industrial aesthetic. A smooth descent, perfect for whoever needed to still grab a coffee that morning. 

In general, the set wasn’t aiming at slapping dancers awake with brute force, preferring breathy dynamics and taking some time to contextualise every mood change. No fast fader cuts, careful EQ mixing instead, providing absolutely seamless transitions. 

Around the two hour mark, Kallait 01 bubbled up from the depths, making for a very apt highlight. The set continued to follow his usual fluctuation between darker passages that never go pitch black and uplifting ambient, never tiring out the floor but always keeping dancers curious to where the next section might head. 
Fadi on a morning slot just works, it was good to have him back in this context. 

Had to leave for social obligations at around 2pm. But I don’t miss openings. 16:29 I was back and ready for absolute havoc. 

So was Altinbas. His intro, chiming but tense, as Pareka’s white spotlights illuminated singular characters on the podiums. The beams start twirling, the bass comes in, smiles everywhere. 

Driving from the very start, yet smooth and round. His approach reminds me of Rødhåd a lot, especially when it comes to building long melodic phrases. These tend to play a central role in his mixes, which feels very coherent to his productions. Another DJ that displays that almost fractal resemblance between producing and DJing, a distillate of identity. 

A dense set, without the shadow of a doubt, relentless at times. Epic is probably one of the adjectives that would describe it best. Narrative and coherence throughout the entire thing, weaving a story at 140 bpm. Once again, similarly to his prime time set last June, people were so captivated that toilet queues shortened and chatting on the floor diminished. Instead, cheer and whistling from every side of the floor.

After mid set, things went dark. Some amazing, cavernous male vocals, fader cuts connecting so well with the floor that people started screaming. The melodic phrases were becoming longer and way more tense, ranging sometimes over the course of eight bars. Almost impossible to take breaks. Lighter passages were becoming scarce, but that’s certainly not a reason to complain. 

Amazing use of dynamics, the times were the mix emptied where hitting as hard as the busy drops. So much immediacy, the bass rarely leaving the mix for longer than eight bars. This guy KNOWS where he’s playing. Impeccable track selection throughout the entire four hours, felt like an entire set composed of highlights. The future is bright for Altinbas, the smile bringer. Resident now. 

Applause dying down. The crowd falling silent as once again the air is brightened by ambient chimes. For 30 seconds. 

Aber dann war Licht aus dikka. Efdemin’s first bass made me giggle and remember instantly how much I love this kind legend of the old guard. 

What followed is the best set I’ve heard this year, without the shadow of a doubt. The elegance that he manages to unleash is incredibly hard to match. Everything is smooth, from the high mids of his foggy kicks to the growling low end, to some of the most amazing hi hats and snares I’ve ever heard. Carpet of funk. 

The mixing? Ridiculous. That’s 30+ years of DJing, understanding what it means to play a room. 
Absurd use of dynamic range and headroom. Always leaving that little extra gain potential, like an ace up his sleeve. 
The same disregard for structure that makes me fly with DVS1, the surprise of things surfacing into the mix when you do NOT expect it in the slightest. 
The Mulero-esque letting the mix quiet down in the course of one bar to almost silence to then make it explode into the room again. 

The constant use of contrast between sections lightening up to then head dive into the abyss. There’s absolutely no way you can leave the floor. You may miss one of the most amazing musical moments in your life. So you stay, sweat and laugh. 

He played slower than his predecessor, necessary in my opinion. Ranging from 138bpm to 136 in later sections, hitting my sweet spot perfectly. I absolutely love it when the crowd is danced into oblivion by a busy set and then something equally as good comes in directly after. This is Berghain in one of its truest, most authentic forms. Music as a gift, when expectations make way to wonder. 

This. Was. Jazz. Danke. 

Thank you J, for being exactly the enthusiastic first timer that you wanna bring to this place, wide eyed and bubbly as they come. Thank you A, for the conversations and for becoming one of my favourite characters in this place. Thank you Ju, for your smile from across the floor and the engaging company.

1j45nwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1j45nwe/shutting_off_the_tap/,Shutting off the tap.,"So, I have a 10-month-old little. She is exclusively breastfed since birth, and what a journey it has been. The experience itself has been one of my most enjoyable parts of being a mother. Despite the challenges early on, we have been extremely successful together and I feel so connected to her through my ability to nourish her body and grow her to be a HUGE baby. (She wears 18 month clothes, shes loooooong) 

Even though I have so enjoyed breastfeeding, I am considering bringing it to completion when she turns one. For im sure similar reasons to other mothers out there, im just ready to reclaim my body, not be so tired all the time, have a little bit of freedom to leave the house for more than 3 hours at a time, use my regular skin care, do something fun with the colour of my hair, maybe drink more than one coffee a day, maybe even have a cocktail or two.... I think I could go on but, you get the point.

All of this being said, the thought of stopping breast feeding makes me want to burst out in tears! I so love doing this for my daughter. I am a staunch believer that fed in best no matter formula or the boob but im having a hard time coming to terms with stopping the tap and putting her on formula. Its really just a **me** problem though. It not because I dislike formula. I just dont know how im going to handle cutting off the baby from the boob...will I feel as connected? Will she? 

Any moms out there able to share their stories of stopping breastfeeding? How did it affect you and your mental? How did the baby respond? Did you feel as connected afterwards? 

The anticipation is both exciting and terrifying and I really dont understand my hyper fixation on whether or not shes going to love me as much after I take the boob away. 

Thanks in advance. Very much looking forward to hearing your stories!

At the time I thought it was cool to do my work for the day and chill. I didn't think it was a problem because I was constantly getting praise from everyone, little awards, and my manager said I contributed just as much as the senior people. HR said I was stealing time after my coworker, who conspicuously I always at odds with and friends with an HR manager, reported me for my Teams icon being yellow too much. so they dropped me. 

My manager gives me glowing references. I saved the company millions ($1.1m) with my solutions. It's all on my resume in detail.

I've put in countless applications and recruiter screens and 25 or so interviews in the last 6-7 months but nothing sticks. I've been to Networking meetups, conventions, dinners, coffee chats.

For Context in this dream, my male  best friend and his younger sister worked at the same company. But his sister claim she was SA by the boss. They reported to authorities but they said the situation didn't have evidence and it was a ""he said, she said, situation"". Him and his sister quit the job and was drowning in depression. He would try to help his sister many many times but she would prefer to be alone and not talk to anyone in the moment. 

Weeks go by and he notices the depression with his sister is taking such a huge toll on her mental health. He becomes genuinely worried and wants to recommend therapy but they don't have money for the session. He calls me up and makes a crazy plan to kidnap his boss's wife to ask for money. I was on edge about this decision but agree to help a friend in need. 

My friend successfully led his Boss's wife to a coffee shop and spike her drink. We got her in the car and tied her up. We reached a forest and my best friend call his boss with an obvious voice changer for the ransome money. His boss did not care his wife was kidnap and hung up. My best friend was so angry that he saw red.

He told me to pin his boss's wife down, I did it without asking questions and he SA her. The dream ended. I woke up terrified. 

Admittedly I can say for certain, I am guilty of assisting him but I did it because I was scared too. My best friend felt like a monster to me, he was no longer the friend I knew when he committed these acts. I obey his command in fear that if I retaliate, he would do something to me.

1j45ehb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j45ehb/my_father_discovered_the_exact_date_of_the_worlds/,My father discovered the exact date of the world's end,"My father spent a long time trying to speak to God, and one day, he claimed God answered—revealing the day the world would end.

He was a physics professor at the state university but had become deeply involved in the occult over the last few years. He set up an office in our backyard, convinced he had found a clue in the Bible leading to something significant.

“Isaiah 66:1 has always been clear, my dear Alice,” he would say to me, his eyes unnervingly intense. ”God is in the skies, and if science searches among the stars, it will find Him.”

His office had a powerful radio with a huge antenna, an optical telescope, and three old laptops, operating non-stop with strange software. He was always checking his old wristwatch, as if it were somehow connected to his investigations. My mother always suspected he had stolen this equipment from the university lab.

She was the silent victim of his obsession, trying to remain understanding and patient, hoping he would return to normal eventually. My siblings and I, however, were in high school at the time and had grown tired of hearing that our father was nuts.

Other kids thought we were eccentric, seeing my dad taking his telescope down the street at dusk, trying to get the best angle of Venus while reading the bible out loud, always wearing the same clothes the whole week. I hated it.

One day, we all woke at 5am to his shouting from the garage.

He was jumping with excitement over a new signal he had received. “It’s undeniable proof that He is telling us something!” he told us, his hair and beard wild, now untrimmed for months.

We just thought that maybe he had finally lost his mind. He had found signals before, and they had always turned out to be satellite noise.

“So, how’s the signal, Dad?” one of my brothers asked the next morning. He answered nothing, just seriously refilled his coffee and walked back to his room. We all assumed he had figured out it was just another dead end.

The day after that, a Saturday, I was really excited about a night birthday party I was invited to. A boy I had a crush on was going to be there.

But in the morning, my father called us all to the living room, his face urgent. 

""No one should leave this house. The world is coming to an end today,"" he muttered, pacing frantically and checking his wristwatch. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days .""I did everything to interpret His message, hoping I was wrong, but I fear this was the warning.""

“What do you mean?” my mother asked, uneasy.

""God, honey,"" he murmured, gripping her shoulder. ""He showed me signals that prove today is of the highest importance.""

“And how do you know it’s the date of the end of the world?” one of my brothers questioned. 

""Because the message was undeniable—He is coming! And the Bible clearly states that the end will begin when...""

""Dad, come on, not now,"" I cut him off, sighing. ""I have something to do tonight. I can’t just stay here based on this crazy theory of yours.""

""No one is leaving this house today!"" he commanded, his voice taking on an authority I had never heard before. ""We must stay together and He shall save us. Trust me, you’ll understand soon, my dear.""

Frustrated, I tried to argue back to no success. I looked at my mother in search for support, but she was too stunned by the idea that her husband might actually be insane to say a word.

I stormed back to my room in a fit of rage and slammed the door shut. This wasn’t fair, and I wouldn’t let my father’s madness ruin my night. After dinner, I locked myself in my room and waited until it was late enough for me to sneak out through the window. The party was only two blocks away, so I just walked there.

And It was fun. My crush and I had the chance to talk for hours, though nothing romantic happened.

Around 1 or 2 a.m., I checked my phone—it had been on silent the whole time. There were multiple missed calls and messages from my mom.

Dozens of messages like: WHERE ARE YOU. PICK UP THE PHONE. GET HERE NOW.

I replied, telling her I was only two blocks away and on my way back. I knew I’d be grounded for this, but it felt worth it.

As I walked home, I kept checking my phone for a response, but her number was offline. I assumed they had gone back to sleep.

When I reached my address, I felt like I had somehow taken the wrong path.

There was nothing there. Just an empty lot, full of dirt and grass, surrounded by what I was certain were my usual neighbors - their houses intact.

I retraced my steps several times to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating, and I wasn’t.

This was where my house was, *just a few hours ago.* And it was no longer there. The doors, the walls, the fence—and everything inside of it—had vanished.

There wasn’t even a trace of wood or debris left behind. It was as if the house had never existed, and nothing had ever been built there.

I tried calling my father, mother and brothers, but their phones were off.

I searched the area frantically, desperate for any clue about what had happened. The only thing I found on the grass was my father’s wristwatch—the one he used for his strange transmissions—stuck at exactly midnight.

Every member of my family was gone, and the truth is, I never saw them again after that day.

They were never found.

\*\*\*

The case of my family's disappearance was in every newspaper in the state for days, mobilizing the entire town in an effort to find them.

The neighbors' security cameras didn’t capture any movement or anything suspicious that night, except for a strong flash of light around midnight—the same hour frozen on the wristwatch.

No one passed by the street. No one saw anything. They simply vanished from this earth and no clues were given.

Then, the feds arrived a week later to investigate. Tall men in black suits and dark glasses combed through the area for days, then left without revealing a single word to the public.

Strangely, the news stopped covering it the very next day, returning to their usual programming of burglaries and park renovations. Over time, this case was only mentioned in podcasts or mystery Youtube channels.

After all that, I went to live with my grandparents and they took good care of me, but the trauma never faded.

A decade has gone by, and no one has found an explanation for my family's disappearance. Now, I’m taking matters into my own hands and sharing this story with everyone I can, determined to uncover the truth, even if too late.

My husband took our daughter to our Airbnb for a nap and then met up with me later in the day. When she left for the nap, she was bundled in a puffy coat, sweater, pants, and shoes. When her dad brought her back, she was in a dress, puffy coat, and shoes (no pants or sweater). I asked my husband where her pants were, assuming she had an emergency diaper situation or that he had put them in the stroller. He informed me that he just didn’t feel the need to put them on her (it was 47 degrees). He blew up at me, said that I treated him badly, that I shouldn’t have been so “mean” to him. I calmly and repeatedly asked why she wasn’t wearing pants and offered to walk back to the Airbnb and get them while he waited with her inside a warm coffee shop. Instead he chased me down the sidewalk with our daughter in tow and then tried to run away from me when I was trying to have a conversation with him.

I’d get fired up about a new routine, stick with it for a week, then fall off when life got busy or I just didn’t feel like it.

Then I realized, I didn’t need *more* motivation. I needed to remove my **ability to negotiate with myself.**

Here’s what worked:

* **I set “non-negotiable” rules for myself.** Instead of “I’ll work out when I have time,” it became: *The moment I put my coffee cup in the sink, I change into workout clothes.* No thinking, no debating, just action.
* **I made discipline easier by reducing friction.** I stopped setting vague goals like “use my phone less” and instead tied it to an existing habit: *Before I open any game on my phone, I complete one small productive task, like a five-minute stretch, a quick journal entry, or tidying up my desk.* No task, no game.
* **I focused on never hitting zero.** I let go of perfection. Didn’t have an hour for a full workout? A five-minute stretch still counted. Too tired to write a full journal entry? One sentence was enough. *Consistency over intensity.*

The result? I stopped relying on willpower. My habits ran on autopilot. And the crazy part? *I actually started enjoying the things I used to avoid.*

If you struggle with discipline, **stop waiting to “feel like it.”** Structure your environment so that good choices happen automatically.

A few years ago, I had the attention span of a goldfish. My brain felt like a web browser with 50 tabs open—constantly jumping from one thing to another, never truly focusing. 

Then I discovered something simple but powerful: **writing**.

Not just any writing. Focused, intentional writing. It completely changed the way my brain works.

**Why Writing Improves Focus**

1. It Forces You to Slow Down

My biggest problem was multitasking. 

I’d try to do five things at once, and as a result, I’d get nothing done. Writing forces your brain to focus on one thought at a time. 

It’s like a mental workout for concentration.

2. It Activates Key Brain Areas

Science backs this up—writing engages multiple regions of your brain, including motor, cognitive, and linguistic areas. 

This keeps your mind actively processing and engaged, instead of bouncing between distractions.

3. It Strengthens Neuroplasticity

The more I wrote, the easier it became to focus. That’s because writing improves **neuroplasticity**, which helps your brain adapt, learn, and filter out distractions more effectively.

4. It Builds Mental Endurance

Writing is like weightlifting for your brain. At first, focusing for even 10 minutes was hard. But over time, my attention span grew, and I could stay locked in for hours. Writing every day **trained** my brain to concentrate longer.

**How to Start Writing for Better Focus**

\- Write for 5 Minutes a Day: Start small. Even a few sentences will help.

\- Stick to One Topic: Jumping between ideas weakens focus. Pick one and explore it.

\- Make It a Daily Habit: Consistency rewires your brain over time.

Since making writing a daily practice, my focus has improved **dramatically**. 

If you struggle with distractions, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Worst case? You gain some clarity. 

Best case? It completely changes how your brain works.

Oh, and speaking of focus—these posts are powered by caffeine. ☕

I loved reading these and it’s finally time to add my own! Im going to include some backstory on my metformin usage too since I see usage questions frequently in here, but not many related to morning sickness. 

In January 2024, I had an appointment with my very progressive OB about getting ahead of potential hyperemesis gravidarum if I were to get pregnant a second time. I had it BAD with my first and it was the most miserable nine months of my life. 

My doctor prescribed me 1500 mg of metformin daily based on new research. I worked up slowly, but ultimately could only stomach 1000mg per day.  I stayed on the metformin until the day before my induction at 39 weeks. 

If you’re curious if the metformin worked for my HG, I think so? I was brutally sick for about 10 weeks and then it just felt like normal morning sickness (or what I imagine is normal), until about 20 weeks. After that, I only got sick about 2-3 times a week until around week 30 when it really decreased. Honestly I think the GD diet helped with that. I also ended up with FIVE bacterial infections and I those antibiotics definitely added to the sickness. 

Anyway, my OB was shocked at how badly I failed my one and three hour already being on 1000 mg of metformin that she automatically referred to an MFM as my doctor only handles diet controlled patients. I was initially bummed since I felt like I wasn’t on metformin for GD, but I got over that quickly. The prescribed diet went well for me and I never needed to increase my medicine and didn’t even have a cheat day during the holidays or any day. I ended up only gaining 15lbs this pregnancy and no doubt that was because of the diet. 

Two days before my induction at my last growth scan, my baby was diagnosed as IUGR so I was super anxious going into my induction (I posted about this and I saw someone mention metformin tied to IUGR in another post, but I don’t think it was? My first child was born past her due date and was only 9oz larger so I think it’s genetics for me). 

The induction itself was honestly so easy peesy. I was so worried about it moving slowly or a potential C-section, but it was great. I started oral misoprostol at 9am and just chilled and drank coffee for two hours as I was told not to stand up during that time. The two hours after that, I walked around the maternity floor, bounced on my ball, and watched Food Networks Tournament of Champions. 

Around 1:30pm I was checked and was around 4cm and started on a low dose of pitocin to increase every 30 minutes. Contractions started picking up and after some gushes of blood, I was checked again and my membranes were manually ruptured. At that point, I was 6cm. I bounced some more and walked around and finally asked for an epidural when I got to 8cm. Not even an hour later, after 8 minutes of pushing (and no stitches needed), my daughter was born. My doctor had me pull her out which was the coolest thing ever and wasn’t even an option given to me with my first daughter. Birth time was 5:12pm so my induction was shorter than my husband’s work day! 

Baby girl weighed 6 pound 8 ounces which was exactly what was predicted on my last growth scan two days prior. Her abdomen was not abnormally small. She passed all her sugar tests. She did have some breathing concerns and a lot of fluid to expel so we had to stay two nights in the hospital. 

Overall the experience was a positive one for me, but I’m so so happy to never have to do it again lol. The newborn stage has been so much easier than with my first despite my husband and toddler being sick (what timing!). I’m very sleep deprived keeping myself and baby isolated, but I’m no longer pregnant so I’m living on that high and I honestly feel so much better than I’ve felt the last nine months. 

This community was so helpful! Glad to finally get to share my story and hopefully it can show that some inductions are really great!

Dealing with a Difficult Boss at My New Job,"I’ve been working for the third week at a coffee shop and bakery. The place has only been open for a month, and I’m the second employee. I don’t have much experience making coffee, but I have the basics, so I’m learning. However, my boss isn’t patient if my way of making drinks is different from theirs, and they get really angry. 

When making drinks, my boss insists that I must hold the spoon and the cup exactly the way they do. Even when placing the cup on the table, the direction has to be the same as theirs. It feels like I have to mimic every little thing they do exactly. I keep getting criticized, and it makes me feel sad. They also mentioned that out of all the applicants, I was the only one they hired after the first employee, so I have to work according to their way.

They also threatened that I can’t leave the job. From making drinks to handling the cash register (even though I have 2 years of experience), everything gets criticized. At the register, my boss is impatient, and when a customer wants to tap their phone for payment, my boss tells me to click ‘paid’ right away to speed up the process. I’m worried about what happens if the customer’s card is declined. My boss said I’m slow and not quick enough, also that i don't have common sense because of this. She said I should click ‘paid’ even if the payment hasn’t gone through, just to make it faster. I need to trust the customer. 

She said I’m not smart and that people like me are the reason the shop is slow. But it’s funny, why did she hire me then? She even said out of all the applicants, she only hired me. 
But I know I’m always friendly when serving customers. I think the shop is quiet because the store is new.

One day, my boss got angry because a box of bread was damaged and blamed me for it. She threw a tantrum and treated me badly in front of customers. As for the working hours, my boss said the job is flexible and I can work on the days that I’m available. However, today when I asked for time off, my boss immediately said they would find someone with more experience than me.

They also said they were upset because I didn’t meet the schedule they gave me. Today, another employee was working with me, and I overheard my boss telling my coworker not to come in tomorrow. Maybe my boss is upset with us because the shop is slow.

Another thing that happened today: every shift we’re allowed to have one free drink. But today, when my coworker and I brought our free drinks, my boss looked really upset and gave us a really angry look. I honestly don’t understand why, especially since she’s the one who said it was allowed.

I feel like this means we’re being fired. What really makes me sad is that I moved to this city without any connections, so it’s hard to find another job. And now this is happening to me.

I'm long past the point of trying to fix my dysfunctional household—it's been proven time and time again that it's a waste of time. My social life suffers a bit from my living situation as I am too drained, and most of my close friends are dealing with their own busy lives, so scheduled plans hardly ever come through. What are some ways that I can reverse the effects on my self-worth, confidence, and submissiveness? My whole life, I've had to walk on eggshells around my mother because of her emotional reactivity. I wouldn't describe my father as a narcissist, but he often enables her so he doesn't have to endure her wrath behind closed doors, as she likes to corner members of the family when alone so she can verbally abuse them that way. My entire household caters to her, and whenever I try to calmly explain how damaging it is to micromanage what my 12-year-old sister eats, force everyone to hold off on eating because she doesn't like the restaurant, or make accusations based on ""a feeling,"" she usually yells back at me everything I tell her. I reflect on those conversations a lot because I can see why my father lets this happen, and it's because it makes absolutely no sense. She's full of contradictions and will change her argument or bring up irrelevant information midway, and at that point, you question whether you're talking to a person or a brick wall, but only if you haven't gone mad by then. The funny thing is that she remembers the things you tell her and regurgitate them back at you—there's no logic, and it's like dealing with the personified stereotype of the mean girl high school bully. I've noticed that this has caused me to have an aversion to conflict, making me come off as a pushover. It's frustrating because I feel as if I now lack a strong resolve and motives. It's hard to make connections when you have a weak character, and no one wants to be friends with a husk of a person who might pull them down.

She has a habit of refusing to back down since it may make her come off as weak. She'll often continue beating a dead horse even after the other person has given in, so saying that she loves indulging in conflict might not be too far from the truth. When my siblings and I were children, her being a devout Catholic, she used to tell us heaven would be mind-numbingly boring because there would be no drama or conflict. While she is pretty religious, she can't make her mind up on which faith she wants to follow—she's Christian/Catholic, Buddhist, and Taoist all at the same time! No judgment to her, but then she has no right to turn around and bash other faiths, no?

I went off track a bit, but I wanted to learn about other people's experiences with similar upbringings. I struggle with finding worth in myself, and I sometimes cannot find the energy to continue improving when things revert to square one out of my control. My mother has insane OCD, and I do as well, so every room in the house needs to be monitored, spotless, and follow the principles of feng shui, or else all hell breaks loose. I feel as if I don't truly own anything, regardless of whether I bought it or not. I've offered to pay rent multiple times in hopes that I can have some say over my living space, but that usually gets ignored. Cleaners come in weekly, and my items usually get moved around or put into a state that raises my blood pressure and puts me into a stressed/panic state - and don’t get me started on when they accidentally damage personal projects or items. The cleaners also don't have a set time they come, so it can be between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., and there's never been a heads-up, so they come unannounced, making it impossible to work around, especially since I do freelance work remotely. It's a privilege I didn't want nor did I ask for, but I still feel conflicted about my lack of gratuity. It's especially frustrating when I'm put on fetch quests or forced into errands that interrupt my workflow during the day; it's vital that I stay on my tasks until completion because of my ADD, and the chances of me completing it after being asked to do favors are little to none. I've expressed this many times to my parents, but it always falls on deaf ears.

It's hard to get out of bed knowing I don't have full control over aspects of my life that I know I should, but I'm aware that I handicap myself in the areas I can improve to help get myself out of this situation. I send out applications daily, ranging from 10 to 15, since that's the only thing I feel I can do at the moment. My question is: What are daily practices I can partake in to avoid any more mental strain? I often go out to libraries, coffee bars, kava lounges, etc. to stay productive, but I become too anxious to connect with anyone in a meaningful way.",3,1741186814.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’ve been turning to ChatGPT a lot lately, but I figured it’s time to ask some real people for advice. 

Apologies in advance for the long post. 

I work as a doctor and an actor, so I travel a lot. When I’m not working, I spend most of my time outdoors with my family and dog. I’m looking for a rugged, weatherproof satchel that can double up as a briefcase that can protect my iPad and hold up to daily use.  I’ve been using my Filson Original Briefcase for years, but I live in the UK and have found that it doesn’t hold up too well in the rain and doesn’t give too much in terms of protection. I’ve seen that some people use the tin cloth wax on them, but I know how tacky it can be to the touch and want to keep my satchel for lighter use. Size-wise, I like the size of the Filson briefcase, although it doesn’t give too much room to pack a jumper, but that isn’t a dealbreaker.  I’ve had a look at Filson’s other bags, but I’m not a fan of their newer models with the external logo and fewer interior pockets. Granted, these can be removed or customised, but I’m still unsure. Their leather briefcase looks great, but it’s old stock, and who knows when/if it’ll be back (https://www.filson.com/weatherproof-leather-original-briefcase.html). 

I’m looking for alternative brands that offer high quality, durable, long-lasting bags, and wondered if anyone had any experience of any of the ones I’ve been looking at or could recommend any others? 

Saddleback Leather (USA)
Their Thin Leather Briefcase is really nice, especially in their dark coffee colour. I’ve read that their pretty indestructible and have a 100 year warranty. I like the idea of it developing its own patina and I’m looking for something to last a lifetime.  I’m already in my 30s, so 100 years may be a bit of overkill, but I like the idea of it being an heirloom piece. I’ve read it can be a bit stiff/heavy and wondered if anyone has any experience with this company? I think it’s a pretty well known one in the US.  (https://saddlebackleather.com/leather-briefcase-laptop-bag-thin). 

Frank Clegg Leatherworks (USA)
The Commuter Briefcase in Burgundy is a beaut. It’s got a classic design and it looks like phenomenal quality. It looks pretty durable, but it maybe has a more formal aesthetic. I’m not sure how it would hold up to rugged, everyday use—especially in outdoor conditions. I’m not familiar with this company, as am UK based, so can anyone share their experience using these bags in real-world settings? Are they weather-resistant, or are they better suited for office life? (https://frankcleggleatherworks.com/commuter-briefcase-burgundy.html). 

Ashley Clarke England (UK)
I’m UK based, so I like that this is more local to me. I’m looking at their Heritage Leather Briefcase, which was designed in collaboration with members of the original Mulberry team - it’s got a rugged aesthetic and also looks quite smart, but not too formal. According to the site, the guy who makes them started out making falconry gear and sells to Middle Eastern royalty. The bag is on the pricier side, but, again, I’m  happy to make the investment if it’s worth it. Does anyone here own one? How does it hold up over time? (https://ashleyclarkeengland.co.uk/products/heritage-leather-briefcase-moorland). 

Rodd & Gunn (New Zealand)
The RG Briefcase is another one that caught my eye.  Love the design and it looks like they have a great reputation. Not heard much about how they will handle heavy daily use, especially in the UK’s wet weather. The minimalist design is appealing, and I imagine it ages well, but is it durable enough for all conditions? Has anyone got any personal experience? (https://www.roddandgunn.com/uk/accessories/rg-briefcase/120674-01.html). 

Ettinger (UK)
A Royal Warrant holder, which is pretty cool. It obviously speaks for its quality. I was looking at their Heritage Mayfair Briefcase. It looks more traditional, but I’m not sure it’s going to be robust enough for daily use. It’s beautiful, but probably doesn’t suit what I need it for.   If you’ve used one casually or in rougher settings, I’d love to know how well it holds up. (https://www.ettinger.co.uk/products/heritage-mayfair-briefcase). 

Il Bisonte (Italy)
I like the look of this one, in theory. I’ve had a wallet that is lighter and it’s darkened beautifully over time. But it does take time. It looks like it’ll develop an amazing patina, but the leather seems soft, which may not hold up as well in bad weather and heavy use. Anyone have any experience with this company? Does it hold up? (https://www.ilbisonte.com/en-extraue/products/bbc048pv0001na135gb). 

Thanks for taking the time to read and I’ll try and get back to everyone (depending on how many responses I get!). 

Please recommend other bags if you have any other thoughts. I love the idea of keeping a bag for life and looking after it, hence why I don’t mind spending money initially. I know a lot of this comes down to personal preference vs. cost, but I’d love to hear your honest opinions. 

I’m probably going to post this on a few different subreddits to get a variety of responses, so thanks in advance for taking the time.

I finally feel at a place where I have no feelings for my ex but only gratitude. 

Saying this, my advice is that remember the progress you made when you're tested. In my circumstance, it was my ex popping up after a year and half being broken up and having intermittent communication throughout. He DMd me asking if I had his passport. Obviously not otherwise I would have returned it by now. Anyway, I though as I am in a good place and moving countries soon I though it harmless to ask if he wanted to go for coffee and catch up. I told him I had been thinking about it but didn't reach out because I was respecting boundaries - but as he had messaged - I thought why not. I was quite vulnerable and warm in my message and told him he had been very important to me - which he had. He actually agreed, though in hindsight still quite guarded. He told me he would get back to me with dates. Well, two weeks later he came with a suggestion for a Saturday.

This was my test of how much I'd grown and how much self-respect I regained. I realised he obviously didn't see the coffee meet the same as me. I don't care no one is that busy that it takes them two weeks to get back. I understand of course, but I am not about to make efforts for someone who can't make the same or similar effort for me, not anymore. So, I basically told him that I'm too busy and that I I can't meet him anymore. I am at peace with this decision, but it has reminded me not to invest in people who don't invest into you.

1j44sua,https://www.reddit.com/r/brandnew/comments/1j44sua/post_about_that_time_i_waited_in_line_for_12/,Post about that time I waited in line for 12 hours to get the RSD Deja.,"Since a lot of us are probably hanging out and waiting for the tickets to go on sale later today, I figured now is as good as time as any to post one of my Brand New stories.

I remember seeing Brand New announce that Deja Entendu was getting an exclusive Record Store Day repressing in early March of 2015. I was ecstatic. However, I had never purchased a RSD exclusive before, so I wasn't sure how the whole process worked. Could I preorder the album in any way? Would a record store even know for sure if they were going to a copy? 

After reading up online a bit, I went into my local record store to ask about the album. The owner there told me that I was the first person to ask him about it, but that he makes his RSD order partially based on customer interest. He said he would definitely try to order some (iirc, he said he could request a max of five copies?), but said there was no guarantee they would get any and thay he wouldn't know until closer to the date.

I left a little disappointed but still determined. I started mapping out the next closest record stores. Turns out, the next closest stores were all an hour or more away from home. I made contingency plans, and called about four other stores to ask if they had planned to request copies as well. All four said they had already ordered, but said the same thing about not being guaranteed, to check back closer to the date.

It's end of March/ begging of April, and RSD is April 18th. I go into my local place again and ask if there are any updates about the album. He tells me at this visit that he knows he's getting it in the delivery, but it's still unclear how many.

Fast forward to April 17th. I call and ask, and he tells me that they have received exactly one copy of the album. I'm in a smaller city of about 50k people, but I had no clue how many other people had wanted a copy local. I asked what his estimate was, and he said a handful of people had also asked, so he advised me to line up early. 

The store was scheduled to open at 10am for RSD. I decided I should get in line at 10pm the night before. It sounds nuts even typing it out now, honestly. My cousins and brother came to hang out for a couple hours, so that was nice. I had multiple people walking to and from the local bars ask what I was hanging around for, but it was a relatively quiet night.

Around midnight, two people leave the bar across the street from the record store. They ask which album I was waiting for, and I tell them. They said they were planning on getting in line for it as well, but also knew there was only one copy and went home instead. I saw one of them ride past on their bike a couple times throughout the night as I waited, but didn't think much of it. 

My boyfriend at the time (now husband) had worked that night. The plan was he'd get a couple hours of sleep, and come much later in the night to save my spot if I wanted a quick nap in the car. Bar close rolls around, and it starts to get a little busy. One other person shows up, but also leaves soon after hearing I was waiting for Deja. This is also around the time my husband showed up. Once it was quiet again, he went to go pick up a pizza. It was a bit cold out, so when he got back I got into the car to warm up and eat a couple slices.

This was at the exact same time the bike riding fan decided to show up again. He saw the empty spot, and started to dismount his bike. I practically threw my half-eaten pizza at my husband and jumped out of the car, sprinting back to my spot in line. The bike rider simply said ""Oh,"" and left again. I decided to eat my pizza outside. 

The rest of the night was boring and uneventful. The line started to grow around 7am. My husband left again around 8am to get pastries and coffee from our local place down the block. When it was time to open at 10am, there were about 25 people in line. The owner came out and told everyone not to push, be polite, etc., and that the RSD releases were all on the far right wall in alphabetical order by artist. I walked straight to the single copy of Deja and secured it happily. I was also lucky enough to snag a copy of The White Stripes RSD edition of Get Behind Me Satan, so that was cool!

So, that's my Brand New story for the day. Now I just have to wait about two hours for tickets to go on sale. We're in Wisconsin, but trying to go to Nashville and/or Newport. For good luck, I'm going to pick up some coffee from the same coffee shop as my RSD story. Not that I'm superstitious, or anything.

Wishing you all the best of luck for your ticket purchases, and hoping to see some of you there!

She in my mind is a very big lover girl but she’s wants the trophy husband lifestyle not the other way around. She hated smart men with good careers. So she had gone on some dates couldn’t stand most of the guys. She had a good thing going with Kristopher Volkov but the idea of a werewolf heir for Rose gen was not something i wanted to sign up for. A big furry hot heathead politician running on all fours raging ditching some poor soul at the altar..yea not this time lol. So she kept going to cafes for morning coffee hoping to meet just someone to even just be a friend. Soooo i have a Save file with some new sims made over townies so i had no clue who was married till i hovered over their name. This guy Taylor Rosenberg was flirting heavy with Miracle and he was married so i was like yknow what sure we need to be disliked anyways so they went out woohood and she’s pregnant yippie. My story was since Taylor was an adult he’s just like starting that mid life crisis stage he had the wife two kids and no job. Arya i think his wife’s name was pulled the weight and they had a distant difficult relationship. Miracle was a minty breath of fresh air career focused but she still was going out having fun she was beautiful smart etc etc i should’ve added pictures to this i will in future posts cause she’s hot. So he dumps his wife and i got mods so he at first gave her custody of the kids and did not want to see them he wanted to start over. Miracle had no idea this happened no idea this wife and these kids existed. But they lived happily until Kristopher Volkov came over and gifted Miracle a faux meat cube(considerate i suppose a werewolf gifting a vegetarian fake meat) And i totally forgot they were in a relationship so she blew him a kiss and Taylor exploded Their relationship disintegrating there was no saving it and there was literally a baby due any second. He was pissed she cheated (even tho he did to just on his wife not her i guess) They were non stop fighting so i moved him out and had the temporarily separate cause they both did awful things but i made him over in cas and he was hot so i wanted to keep him lmao. Baby Regan my Rose sim was born few days later and He did come to the hospital and he was being sooooo good They were laughing swaying and i was like ohh 😊 yay. I thought they could fix these two full red relationship bars. But holy cow i could make zero progress getting them to actually make amends they kept yelling at eachother. So Regan was brought hope and then i get a text From Taylor saying he’s in love with Miracle and wants to get back together? (why didn’t you say so at the hospital what changed in literally five sim minutes) So I’m like okay he probably had some time to himself to reflect on the two beautiful women he hurt and the children he’s also hurting he’s a changed man. So we came home set up 3 day rotation with his other kids and now everything is just fine but it’s the sims so i’m just waiting for something to happen. I hardly got any Not So Berry progress done too this all happened in one little session of the sims. 

And if you made it to the bottom of this or read my title please let me know what’s going on in your sims life lol i’m always curious what drama everyone else has in their saved ",4,1741186274.0,Sims4,1,1.0,False

I’ve been turning to ChatGPT a lot lately, but I figured it’s time to ask some real people for advice. 

Apologies in advance for the long post. 

I work as a doctor and an actor, so I travel a lot. When I’m not working, I spend most of my time outdoors with my family and dog. I’m looking for a rugged, weatherproof satchel that can double up as a briefcase that can protect my iPad and hold up to daily use.  I’ve been using my Filson Original Briefcase for years, but I live in the UK and have found that it doesn’t hold up too well in the rain and doesn’t give too much in terms of protection. I’ve seen that some people use the tin cloth wax on them, but I know how tacky it can be to the touch and want to keep my satchel for lighter use. Size-wise, I like the size of the Filson briefcase, although it doesn’t give too much room to pack a jumper, but that isn’t a dealbreaker.  I’ve had a look at Filson’s other bags, but I’m not a fan of their newer models with the external logo and fewer interior pockets. Granted, these can be removed or customised, but I’m still unsure. Their leather briefcase looks great, but it’s old stock, and who knows when/if it’ll be back (https://www.filson.com/weatherproof-leather-original-briefcase.html). 

I’m looking for alternative brands that offer high quality, durable, long-lasting bags, and wondered if anyone had any experience of any of the ones I’ve been looking at or could recommend any others?

Their Thin Leather Briefcase is really nice, especially in their dark coffee colour. I’ve read that their pretty indestructible and have a 100 year warranty. I like the idea of it developing its own patina and I’m looking for something to last a lifetime.  I’m already in my 30s, so 100 years may be a bit of overkill, but I like the idea of it being an heirloom piece. I’ve read it can be a bit stiff/heavy and wondered if anyone has any experience with this company? I think it’s a pretty well known one in the US.

Thanks for taking the time to read and I’ll try and get back to everyone (depending on how many responses I get!). 

Please recommend other bags if you have any other thoughts. I love the idea of keeping a bag for life and looking after it, hence why I don’t mind spending money initially. I know a lot of this comes down to personal preference vs. cost, but I’d love to hear your honest opinions.

1j44ocj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j44ocj/i_am_struggling_with_a_break_up_for_the_first/,I am struggling with a break up for the first time in my life.,"The title isnt to mean this is my first breakup, i’ve had plenty. This most recent breakup was with my partner who I have been on and off with for about four years. Our longest stretch together was a year and a half, and that ended in the summer of 2023. 

I broke it off with him after that year and a half because he cheated on me the entire time we were together and I was constantly made to feel like prioritizing my feelings was in some way disrespectful to him. I woke up and broke up with him. It was freeing I can remember, I had fun and I was enjoying my independence. 

Summer 2024 comes around and after a couple flings-nothing serious at all- I started missing him so bad, it felt like a physical need for him. Over the course of our time apart he had apologized to me several times and he said he did not blame me for leaving and that he wanted to do the work to get me back. I would ignore them or respond honestly, saying that he is only contacting me to absolve his own guilt for his actions, because he was expecting me to be soft and regretful towards him. Despite me feeling this way and despite him doing me so dirty, I still missed him more than I have ever missed any if my previous partners.

So I hit him up (still in the summer) we went on a date and talked about so much, it was so romantic and I fell in love all over again. However, when we got back together I was still itching for my own independence despite me loving being with him. This time around, he was perfect. He made me feel loved, valued, safe, beautiful, his family welcomed me back in with no hesitation. He had worked on himself and grew from everything the last time we dated, It was working. 

Until it wasn’t. 

My schedule got super busy and I had less time for him, he was happy to accommodate as he knows I have other priorities. We would value the time we could get together but it was becoming an obvious strain. He would drive up an hour to see me for maybe 2-3 hours as we went on a coffee date in a downtown or went out to eat, and then drive back home. It was taking a toll on him. I told him it would just be this way until May when my schedule lightens up because of summer and we have to hold through. If driving is a lot for him we can skip a couple weeks so that he can rest. He didn’t wanna do that. After that conversation, the next week we got into a really intense conversation about our future. We want entirely different things and I made it very clear that I cannot give him what he wants. He was visibly sad about it, but we moved on. It stayed in the back of my mind though. 

That conversation and my itch for independence grew until it was the only thing on my mind. About a month later, I broke up with him (after 7 months of being back together). He was fighting so hard to not lose me. He sent me a poem and tried to burn a cd of my favorite playlists (this is exactly what I did for him for valentines day so that felt weird) he said if our different plans for the future mattered to him at all he would’ve broken up with me right then. I think it was on oversight on his part, but even if that was true, I don’t want him to sacrifice his wants for me. I was not going to for him, so I couldn’t and wouldn’t ask that or expect that of him. 

He told me I had no right to end our relationship on the basis of what I think he wants and deserves- I told him he deserves someone who can give him what he wants-  and that if I am struggling, he would rather us struggle together than apart. There was nothing I could say about the relationship that he wasnt willing to try to fix. He was just failing to see that very likely he would begin to resent me, because I wouldnt get married to him or start a family, so I leaned into my want for independence. I told him I didn’t allow myself much time alone when we were apart and I would like to realize who I am and define who I am, outside of a relationship and Id like to be alone. Though that was true, I feel so guilty for following through with the breakup after his efforts.  I love him so much and I didn’t want to, but I feel like I would be saving us from significantly more heartache down the line. My friends and family support my decision and think I made the right one, but I am deeply regretting it. 

He blocked me on everything, which he did not do the first time we broke up, and has ignored my efforts in communicating so that I can give him what ever of his things he wants back. I can tell he is incredibly hurt by this, I am afraid he wont bounce back like he did last time, I know I can’t take this back because I have hurt him too bad, but I so wish I could. 

I have never felt so empty and upset at myself for breaking up with someone before. I can typically move on rather quickly and not feel the sting of the past when I encounter something that is reminiscent of my partners. This time around I feel so hollow without him, even though I wanted this. I feel especially guilty because he said my main reason for breaking up didn’t matter to him. I wish I would’ve stayed to see if we could have worked it through, to see if I really did want to be independent. But I can’t take it back. While we were breaking up I told him I loved him and always will. When I said I wanted to be alone he said “If that is what you want then there is no point in talking anymore”. That hurt because there was still so much to say. I don’t want to be alone anymore if it means truly no more him in my life. I don’t know if I am saying this because I am riding off the emotions of a breakup, or because I made an irreversible mistake. 

I wish I could tell him how I feel but he doesn’t need to be subjected to hear any more from me. Hearing from me would probably upset him more, and I just want him to be okay. I didn’t want to hurt him and I was trying to be as gentle and accommodating to his feelings as possible because 1. I love him and 2. I knew I was going to be okay. But im not okay. I just want to walk around downtown with him even though its too cold, I want to look at the used book section in our comic book store again, I want to get thai food with him for the millionth time even though Im tired of thai food. I just hurt him in a way that I don’t think he will forgive me for and that sucks because I forgave him for everything he did to me the first time we dated. 

I just have never felt such deep regret or sadness for a breakup, even when I was the one broken up with. I just hope this feeling does pass, and I didn’t make a mistake even though right now, Id rather be happy with him than happy alone. ",1,1741185966.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I (40s M) have been seeing a woman from work since last fall. We're both divorced with two kids each. Things started strong but she hit the brakes in October citing workplace concerns. We started reconnecting in December with coffee dates, then a movie in January, and dinner at my place two weeks ago.

I had a conversation with her on our last 'date' about my intentions. She commented that she was ok with the slow burn. After dinner and hours of great conversation, she left and texted me when she got home that she regretted not kissing. She also mentioned she ""wouldn't string me along.""

We made plans for the following weekend, but a snowstorm prevented it. She suggested the following week. But then she got sick (conformed ). I tried to set something up the following week and her daughter had a tournament. I decided to not suggest another specific date, instead just texted to let ke know when she would be up for it. She replied that unfortunately it would need to be after spring break but also included  the end is in sight for activities every night of the week

Now we're both traveling during different halves of spring break, meaning we probably won't see each other until the 22nd at earliest - nearly a month after the ""regret not kissing"" text.

Key things to note:
- I'm almost always the one who initiates texts/plans
- She responds positively and in detail when I do reach out
- She occasionally texts me during significant events (trips, games)
- her last relationship wasn't great (don't know the details but sounds like it didn't end well. 
- She seems more reserved at work than in private

I'm confused by the mixed signals - explicit interest in her texts, but she rarely initiates contact.

Could this just be circumstantial bad timing? Am I reading too much into things?

I'm prepared to step away, but at the same times seems foolish, given that her last meaningful text was a clear expression of physical attraction. ",0,1741185897.0,datingoverforty,31,0.5,False

Please recommend other bags if you have any other thoughts. I love the idea of keeping a bag for life and looking after it, hence why I don’t mind spending money initially. I know a lot of this comes down to personal preference vs. cost, but I’d love to hear your honest opinions. 

I’m probably going to post this on a few different subreddits to get a variety of responses, so thanks in advance for taking the time. 

I’m also thinking about doing a video review once I’ve made my decision—let me know if that’s something you’d be interested in!

However, I was actually given the prescription only two days ago (lol)  
  
I was put on titration with Elvanse 20mg, and oh boy, the effects were absolutely terrifying. On the first day, I just felt super sleepy and dizzy around midday, but nothing too concerning, I took a quick nap and was a bit better. However, yesterday, I genuinely thought I was going to die 🥲   
I developed the worst migraine I’ve probably ever experienced in my life and kept vomiting for a solid 6–7 hours. Yes, I took the medication after food. I do have a sensitive stomach, so that could have been a contributing factor.

This experience has made me really scared to try other medications. Maybe stimulants are just too strong for me (I can’t even tolerate coffee—it gives me tachycardia and dizziness), so I probably should’ve expected this 😞  I feel a bit defeated and concerned that my body might not be cooperative when it comes to these kinds of medications, and I might have to accept that I cannot be medicated.

Context: My last girlfriend broke up with me on 2015, Had terrible experiences after that and decided to focus on my career, myself and get my shit together.

I (39M) hit the gym regularly, financially stable, mentally sound, could be more than ok by myself, but decided to give dating one last chance.

I met a girl (34F) through a dating app, we have been to a couple of dates, planning to go to another one this weekend. She’s never married, childfree, no baggage. We haven’t done anything fancy yet, just coffee, cheap restaurants and walking around. She seems smart, easy to talk to, bubbly personality and all of that.

However, there are a couple of things that are rubbing me the wrong way, like during our first date I was a bit tired due to a rough week at work, probably not my best first impression I gotta admit, but she was very quickly to point that out and ask if I regularly don’t express my emotions or things like that, I appreciate the honesty and told her the truth, that I was just tired, but is that something you say on your first date? I haven’t dated much but are people like that nowadays?

Anyway I tried to salvage the date and I feel I succeeded in a way, until it started raining, I did have a foldable umbrella in my bag and offer her to use it, she agreed but then it became chilly and said something like “when you take a girl out you should probably bring an extra sweater or something for situations like this”Huh? I had a windbreaker that I was wearing and told her if she wanted it, I don’t mind since I’m used to cold weather, but she refused. After that awkward moment I suggested taking shelter at a nearby cafe until it stopped raining, that at least allowed me to change the subject and carry on with the date, after that it went better I feel like.

We had a second date, this time it went fine, nothing weird happened, was staring to feel we were getting to know each other a bit better.

Fast forward, she wanted to talk over the phone, no particular reason just to chat, we had been talking through the dating app until now so to actually talk I asked for her Line (we live in Japan, that’s what people use here) account, to which she agreed. She sent me her details, that I checked later, added her and told her I’ll have a bath and call her later. When I called her I was trying to be nice and talkative, and then she says something like she pays attention to the little details, and she doesn’t appreciate when people leave her waiting, that since it was the first time we would talk over the phone it should have been special and whatnot. Once again, huh? It wasn’t even an hour, like what? We talked about other things later, nothing important, but obviously it felt so awkward due to her “feedback”.

We are supposed to go out again this weekend but I’m having second thoughts, I am being the insensitive one here? Have I been out of the game for so long that I forgot how to date? Or are those things actual red flags that I should pay attention to?

And lastly, so far I’ve been paying for the dates, it’s only been coffee dates and cheap restaurants so I don’t mind, but after two dates I would expect at least some reciprocity, right? She recently switched jobs, hasn’t started her new one so I guess money is a bit tight, like I said I don’t mind but I certainly do not want or expect this to become the norm, not because I can’t pay, but because in my opinion, in this time and age I would expect my partner to at least pull her own weight.

I have 10mg capsules from a compounding pharmacy.

The only medications I take otherwise is TRT low dose (80mg testosterone per week is my sweet spot).

So on an otherwise normal morning I took a capsule. Within 10 minutes I experienced extreme anxiety, agitation, drenched in cold sweats. It’s like my eyes were twitching side to side as well, I could not focus on one spot without freaking the hell out so I had to keep darting my eyes around. I felt depersonalized and derealization. Dizziness. Extremely disconcerting. Fast heart beat, pretty much full on panic attack. This lasted about 2 hours, after which my brain thinking felt extremely sharp, like I was on adderall on something. I would call it like “HD” thinking. This lasted for a few hours and then back to normal. 

I really did not enjoy this feeling. I tried it again about a week later and same thing. No coffee or anything before. I’m not on any SSRIs or any neuroactive medication.

Wtf? Was this a mild serotonin syndrome? I don’t drink red wine or eat lots of cheese or anything. I do work out and eat a shit ton of protein and red meat. 

I’m scared to ever try it again.

Nice customer(19ish year old man who looks sad) walks in.
Walks to counter
   Husnia-Welcome to CaFae Late, today's special is Loch Ness drop bubble tea-a new drink which helps bring out surpressed emotions and makes you feel safe and coasy! What would you like today
   Nice customer-Yeah sure, one of those😔.
   JC-Ill get started on that for you...Are you OK?
   Nice customer- Yeah I'm fine, I guess.
   JC-I don't mean to introde but I can see something is bothering you. You pick up a thing or two in jail.
JC hands over drink and Nice customer takes a sip. Tears start rolling down his face due to drink effect.
   Husnia-That will be... O goodness what's happening?
   Nice customer-Im not OK! My grandma just died and I don't know what to do! She is the only one in my family who supported me when I came out as gay and now I am lost. I came in because on her deathbed she loved to order out from this place and I wanted to try it in her memory.. and than, and than, and than I took a sip and I don't know what is happening...😢
   Nicole- Here put him in my comfy chair, I'll stand up and her I am carrying a soft blanket!

Rude customer walks in and gets to counter. Husnia says special again and asks what the Rude customer(Another older man) wants?
   Rude customer- I'll get a dark roast coffee.
   Husnia- I'll get that going, it will be a few minutes so fell free to...
   Rude customer- What a shame!
   Husnia- Excuse me?
   Rude customer- Todays generation aren even real men, I mean look at that one cryinng in the corner
   Husnia-I beg your finest pardon! No matter a man or a woman, anyone is allowed to cry or be themselves at any time .
   JC- Yeah asshole cut it out before the fairy boss messes you up!
   Rude customer-What is she going to do- tickle me with her wings! And besides, I am correct, he needs to man up and deal with whatever like a real man.(Bob walks in without rude customer noticing). Nowadays all the boys are some softies who cry at the drop of a feather. Honestly where did we go wrong to get to ... this!? And really what could be so bad that our little princess over there...
   Bob- SILENCE!
Rude customer is shocked and trying to scream.
   Bob-We have heard enough out of you! Nobody insults a customer at my café unless they deserve it and in this case you are the one who should be insulted!
   JC- To be honest boss, I thought you would shut him up a lot earlier.
   Bob- I was in a good mood and thought I would let him finish but he showed me he doesn't deserve our time and attention. What shall I curse you with, but don't worry I only tickle 🤗!
   Rude customer-makes attempt to speak
   Bob- For the next seven years you will have extreme emotional outbursts especially when you are out in public and won't have any control over your emotions. And since you are so manly for those seven years you will also only be good at feminine crafts and will loose almost all ability in manly ones.
   JC- Go Bob - two at once is sick. And for you(turns to rude customer) - Whipe your pathetic toxic masculinity out of this café before I decide I need to do something about you! (Rude customer grunts and walks towards door)

I’m here to caution new parents that this isn’t always true. It doesn’t always get better. I’m 7 months in and for me, it’s only gotten more challenging and unpleasant. My daughter was colic, had reflux and a CPMA and we spent the first 4-5 months listening to her scream 8 or so hours a day. She would wake on average 3-5 times at night and my husband and I were shells of the people we once were. 

I kept hearing from everyone, “it’ll get better”, and although we’ve made it through the colic, sleep trained for nights and naps, and have weaned off her Pepcid and have her on a hypoallergenic formula, it didn’t get better. The challenges just changed. Every waking moment she is the most fussy, difficult child to deal with that needs 24/7 attention and is still unsatisfied. She scream cries through 80% of her wake windows with displeasure or bordem from her toys or activities we have available to her. Isn’t happy being held, but doesn’t want to be put down. When she is picked up, she pulls out my hair and smacks me with her arms to be let down and then continues to scream. She won’t let others hold her and has major “stranger danger”. She will hysterically cry if I leave the room or if I’m in the room and not holding her. She is so dependent that I can’t even leave the room and put her down with her toys or in a play pen to make a coffee or go to the bathroom. 

Every day is miserable and by 8 am I’m ready to call it quits. I question if I made a huge mistake by choosing to become a parent. On top of it all, my relationship with my husband has fallen apart. We are at each others throats every day and it seems like we’re just moving through the motions to survive. Nothing has gotten better, if anything, things continue to get worse. I feel Iike I ended up with a baby with the worst temperament and being stuck with her feels like prison. After 7 months of this, I have lost all hope that it is “just a phase” and that “it’ll get better”. I wonder if I’m alone in this experience, or if there are others that feel the same.

I mean, let's be real – it's not always easy.

For me, it's been a journey of learning to communicate effectively, dividing responsibilities, and finding quality time for ourselves (yes, that's a thing!). But it's not always easy. There are days when I feel like we're just trying to survive, rather than thrive.

One of the biggest challenges we've faced is finding that balance between being parents and being partners. It's easy to get caught up in the daily routine of parenting – school runs, meal times, bedtime routines – and forget to nurture our relationship.

So, how do we make it work? For us, it's about setting aside quality time for each other, whether that's a date night, a walk around the block, or just a quiet cup of coffee together in the morning.

We also make sure to communicate openly and honestly about our needs and expectations. That means being willing to listen to each other, even when we don't agree.

Of course, it's not always easy. There are days when we disagree on everything, from discipline to dinner plans. But ultimately, we know that we're in this together.

I'd love to hear from you – how do you and your partner navigate the ups and downs of parenting as a team? What are some of your favorite tips and strategies for keeping your relationship strong?

By the way, I've been thinking a lot about how single moms navigate the dating world while parenting. It's a whole different set of challenges, and I have so much respect for those who are doing it solo.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j44a1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyUK/comments/1j44a1o/first_things_first_tea/,"First things first, tea","I am not a tea drinker. I'm an avid coffee drinker, to such an extent that among my most prized possessions is a Le Creuset French press that I bought for £45 from John Lewis. 

That may change, however, as I have recently learned that our Republican cousins across the Irish Sea actually outdrink us in the metric of tea consumption per capita. That, I'm sure you'll agree, is not acceptable. 

While we'll only dream of catching the Turkish - who rank 1st and probably always will - being outdone among our shared isles at the only stereotype that's even vaguely true is, frankly, a pathetic effort. 

So, I will be putting my whole gluttonous, caffeine-addicted self into this pressing and noble cause. That begs the question, of course - which tea shall I drink? 
  
  
  
***Yorkshire Tea***   
Yorkshire Tea is owned by the Bettys & Taylor Group, which started as Bettty's Tea Rooms in 1919. The company is still based in the first Betty's tea room in Harrogate and is still owned by the founding family. 

***Tetley***   
Tetley is owned by Indian company, Tata. Tea Pigs is also a subsidiary of Tata. 

***Typhoo***   
Typhoo has had a messy and unfortunate recent history. Between closing factories and being sold to an equity fund, they found the time to go into administration in November 2024. They are now owned by Supreme Imports which are based in Manchester and appear to be British-owned. 

***Twinings***   
Twinings is a brand of tea owned by Associated British Foods, which itself is majority-owned (54.5%) by British-based Wittington Investments holding company.  
Wittington Investments is owned by the British side of the Weston family, being chaired by Sir Guy Weston. Technically, it's majority owned by the British charity that the Weston family founded, but as the company has a history of tax-dodging, I suspect that the purpose of the charity isn't entirely altruistic.  
Other food brands that are owned by Associated British Foods include: Kingsmill, Ryvita, Dorset Cereals, Jordan's (cereals), Blue Dragon, Patak's, Ovaltine (non-USA only), Silver Spoon, and Primark. 

***PG Tips***   
PG Tips is a part of Lipton Teas and Infusions, which also includes the Lipton and Pukka brands. Lipton Teas and Infusions is owned by a Luxembourg-French private equity fund that's based in Jersey, called CVC Captial Partners. 

***Thompson's***   
Thompson's is a Northern Irish company that was founded in 1896 by Robert S Thompson. They are still owned and run by the Thompson family. 

***Clipper***   
Clipper is the first British company to get a Fairtrade Mark. Now, however, it is owned by French multinational food company, Ecotone, which is in turn owned by a French private equity fund called PAI Partners. 

***Tick Tock, Dragonfly & Eleven O'clock***   
Tea Times Trading Ltd operates the Tick Tock Tea, Dragonfly Tea, and Eleven O'clock Tea brands and is an independent, family-owned British company. 

***Drink Me Chai & Bubbleology***   
Drink Me Chai and Bubbleology are owned by Aimia Foods, which was recently reacquired by the founding Unsworth family, with Rob Unsworth becoming chair,  and is thus British-owned. Horlicks is also owned by Aimia Foods. 

***PerfectTed***   
PerfectTed makes matcha green tea energy drinks and is a small British Dragons' Den start-up. 
  
  
  
**Bonus**   
It's commonly thought that tea cannot be grown in Britain, but that's actually not true. Tea plants are quite hardy and we do have tea growers in the UK. 

So as a little treat for the folks that read all the way to the bottom of what is essentially a long and boring list of tea companies, I'll share with you a company that grows tea in British soil and makes it available to buy: Tregothnan. 
  
  
  
Thanks for reading,

Keep calm and buy British.

1j449v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j449v5/how_do_i_18f_break_things_off_with_my_married/,How do I (18F) break things off with my married boss/coworker (62M)?,"

I (18F) met my ‘boss’ (I’ll call him John) through another job I have as a first aid trainer where he is my coworker. John is 62M, married and living with his wife, and has a daughter and granddaughter. He was my mentor while I was just starting out and I did my first shifts shadowing him. He also runs a private first aid team where his clientele are nightclubs and mlm sex-positive parties and he ended up inviting me to work with him on New Year’s Day (ergo why I call him my boss). 
After our training shifts together we’d make it a habit to get coffee and chat after, but he only started making advances the day he offered me a spot on his team; stuff like calling me ‘baby’ and kissing my forehead.
I don’t see him until New Years Day after that. The night (2100-0700) goes great all things considered; I’m rostered on with three others (including John) and we’re divided into two teams, with the primary team being me and John. 
Throughout the night we’d do patrols around the club to survey and make ourselves visible to patrons, which ended up mostly being standing in a corner and him putting an arm around me or hugging. I’m big on physical contact and am a fairly touch starved person so I didn’t mind it at the time, and he told me to tell him if he made me uncomfortable which I appreciated but never affirmed. 
We end up having two ambulance transports that night before things get calm and he lets the two other first aiders off around 0600. The rest of the night we spend inside the nightclub, which has drastically dwindled in numbers, and he ends up taking us to a dark corner and taking it further. We didn’t have penetrative sex but it was my first sexual experience. 
When I realised what was happening I did admittedly feel really uncomfortable but weighed up that discomfort versus the discomfort of having to ask him to stop and decided the former was preferable and so ended up just going with the flow; I will disclaim that he asked if I was okay, I said yes, and I feel that he would’ve stopped if I had asked him to. 

For all of the following gigs he and I are the only ones rostered on. 

The next gig I had with him was two weeks later. During those two weeks we only communicated occasionally via messages and mostly about work-related things, with the two exceptions being when he invited me to shadow more of his first aid training shifts and when he invited me to a motel; I declined both, but after the latter he cut back my next shift by two hours and asked me to arrive later than the previously established time.
Nothing happens on this second shift aside from some sexually toned jokes. 

Third and fourth shifts are explicitly sexual but we have a conversation where he says that he would draw the line at full on penetrative sex. This is important because on shift number 5 (most recent), he tried to stealth me. I noticed it, asked what he was doing, and he said that he couldn’t get me pregnant without elaborating so I didn’t try to stop him again. He ended up pulling out, and at the time I felt okay with it, but the day after I took plan B and booked an STI screening test and I think the gravity of it all really started weighing down on me.

I want to say he’s a good person but I don’t think I want to pursue this anymore. In a perfect world I’d somehow find a solution where I can say that I don’t want to have sex with him while still being employed by him but I don’t know if that’s in the cards. Do I have a responsibility to report this to our boss at our training job? His actions aren’t entirely ethical but it’s not like they happened in a vacuum. 

Sorry for how messy this post is. Any advice appreciated. ",0,1741184823.0,relationship_advice,22,0.4,False

He felt like a puppet whose strings had been cut. What had the journalist really done for him anyway? at least the lawyer had got his books back. Now he was stringless, as well as Ohm-less, and back in control of his life, at least the waking part of it. ""I don't need any knight in shining armour,"" he told himself. ""I'll fight my own battles.""

After coffee, the first thing he did was call the police force's general enquiry hotline to see if there'd been any progress on his case. The phone rang for five minutes, then an electronic voice ran through a series increasingly obscure options until he followed the instruction to - ""Press nine for ongoing case enquiries."" Ten minutes later, a fast-speaking, distant-sounding, roughly-accented, male voice said a lot of things K could barely understand before asking him to hold. Fifteen minutes later, it came back and asked him for his case number. ""I haven't been given a case number.""

""So, you should have been given a case number... is it on your phone?""

""Not unless it's a serial number.""

""In your text messages.""

""I don't have any text messages.""

""Email?""

""I don't have any emails.""

""I see... so, do you require any *special* assistance?""

""No, thank you, I just need an up...""

""Name?""

""Joe K.""

""Address?""

""Flat 42, North Block, Malevich Square, Glowbridge, GB6 7XF.""

""So, I'm going to have to ask you some security questions... So, what was the name of your first pet?""

""I've never owned a pet.""

""...So, where did you first go on holiday?""

""...Cuba?""

""...So, what can we do for you today, Mr K?""

""I just need an update on my case.""

""So, I'm looking at your case details now... So, I'm going to have to transfer you to a different department, bear with us."" K was put on hold for a further twenty minutes.

""Special Assistance, my name is Paula. How may I help you, today?"" said a slow-speaking, clear-sounding, smoothly-accented, female voice.

""I just need an update on my case.""

""No problem. Are you able to tell me your case number?""

""I don't have a case number.""

""That's fine. Are you able to tell me your name?""

""Joe K.""

""That's great. Are you able to tell me your address, Joe?""

""Flat 42, North Block, Malevich Square, Glowbridge, GB6 7XF.""

""That's great. Now, we need to go through some security questions, is that OK, Joe?""

""Cuba.""

""That's a nice name, is it a dog?""

""No, it's a country, it's where I went on holiday as a kid - I've never owned a pet.""

""That's fine... It's asking me for your first car, Joe - can you remember?""

""I don't drive.""

""That's fine... How about the first album you ever bought?""

""...*People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm*.""

""...Too many characters... could it be something else?""

""...*Screamadelica*?""

""...No, that's not it... could it be something else?""

""...I've got it - *Sign o' the Times*.""

""...No, that's not it, we've got one more attempt left, Joe, would you like to try again?""

""Never mind.""

""... No, that's not it, either. I'm sorry, Joe, but your file has been locked down for security reasons. Would you like me to transfer you to our fraud department?""

""No, that's fine.""

""That's fine. Is there anything else I can help you with today?""

""No... thank you.""

""That's great. You have a good day, Joe.""

""You too, Paula."" K hung up and called Clean Knows to tell them he was available for work again, for any client except one, and wrote their contact number on a piece of paper he dropped into Katie's mailbox on his way out.

He went for a long walk in the morning sunshine, defiantly staring down the CCTV cameras and ignoring the zephyrs and black helicopters, determined not to let any outside forces, real or imaginary, bother him again. As he took a leisurely stroll around Bosch Gardens, he watched the squirrels frolicking in the trees, with nothing but birdsong in his ears and even less on his mind. On a bench by a stream, he spent fifty minutes of solitude reading *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, until a friendly beagle came to say hello. An old man with a wooden walking stick apologised for his dog's intrusion then sat down and asked him if his book was any good and what it was about. They spent fifteen minutes mentioning books to each other that they failed to have any mutual experience of, then the old man spent a further five minutes moaning about his lazy son-in-law and kids today, and K wished him a good day and continued his long walk around the quiet back roads and along the riverbank. By the time he reached the cafe on Kandinsky Road, he'd built up enough of an appetite to satisfy it with an all-day breakfast.

When he got home, he took a couple of leaping pills and lay down on his bed, listening to anything on the radio except phone-ins - some refreshingly light comedy, some surprisingly dark comedy, some old music that wasn't the usual songs they endlessly repeat on every commercial station and some new music that wasn't just three minutes of instantly forgettable monotony. After he finished Marquez's homonymous epic, he had a coffee break with a couple of digestives, before losing himself in the everyday tragedy of John Williams' *Stoner*. In the evening, he had a beer and watched the third episode of the slightly disappointing and increasingly far-fetched second series of a mystery drama whose first series had been very good, the start of true crime documentary that was more of a promotional film for a universal DNA database, and the end of *The Deer Hunter*. Then he went to bed, read some more, and went to sleep. It was a great day. One nil to K.

It was three nil when his walk took him into the vicinity of the Black Bottom. He was sat in the Thelonious Monk booth, warming himself up with a coffee and *Pale Fire* when *The Afterglow* landed on the table. K's blank expression stared back at him. ""I thought I recognised that face,"" said Ma Rheaney. He pushed the newspaper away, his recently re-established, blissful anonymity floating away on his sighing breath. Worse still was, four days after vowing to permanently sever his ties with Broker, his unwelcome presence came crashing back into K's consciousness via Pearl Goolie's article. ""You've already read it, then?"" He shook his head.

""That would be a bit narcissistic, wouldn't it?"" was his excuse.

""I wouldn't worry that, it doesn't really say much about you.""

""Huh? What's it about then?""

""An altruistic, magnanimous and courageous local politician, sticking up for the disenfranchised, honest, salt of the Earth, working folk, unjustly accused of wrongdoing by a public service which failed in its duty of care and treated him so badly that a long-term impact on the already vulnerable state of his mental health was almost inevitable, but if you vote for me... is the gist of it. The only thing that says anything about you is the photograph, and all that says is - 'look, he's white man'... So, has it made your mental health any less vulnerable?""

""Is that special offer still on?"" said K. Ma sat down opposite him. ""When we first met I was a criminal, now I'm a victim.""

""When we first met you were a shy little boy who always had his head in a book. I'd say you haven't changed much in the last forty years, so I wouldn't worry too much about what label other folk want to put on you - it usually says more about them than it does about you. You may be a victim, you may be a criminal. You may be a nihilist, like the article says.""

""'I've got *nothing*, Ma, to live up to.'""

""True enough - even without your own belief system, other folk are still going to want to fit you into their own. But you can't really blame them, it's all about survival, like it always has been. However much the world changes, humans will always carry the legacy of the past with them.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well, you might think overpopulation is a big problem now but, thousands of years ago, underpopulation was an even bigger problem. Humans had gone and evolved big fucking brains in big fucking heads and a lot of womenfolk were dying in childbirth. On top of that, menfolk were competitive, jealous and aggressive. On top of that you had other tribes coming in and killing your menfolk and abducting your womenfolk to improve their own populations. So to be successful, a tribe needed to be able to control its members - you needed to have rules governing human behaviour. A rule against stealing other folk's food and a rule demanding that you share your own food with other folk. A rule against killing members of your own tribe and a rule demanding that you kill members of a rival tribe. A rule against homosexuality and a rule demanding that you procreate as much as humanly possible. So, a successful tribe had to be philanthropic, xenophobic, homophobic and misogynistic. Now, over time, whichever tribe could enforce rules like these most effectively was obviously going to have an advantage, and rules that have existed for generations and were originally given to the tribe by a god-like ancestor who could punish them for disobedience, in this life or the next, would prove to be an extremely effective way of controlling folk. Tribes like this became so successful that other tribes had no choice but to become subservient to them if they wanted to survive at all, and that meant following the same rules and adopting the same belief system - hence, religion. As the population increased and tribes evolved into city-states, these belief systems became ever more entrenched in the psychology of human societies, surviving the rise and fall of empires and the agricultural and industrial revolutions to remain the socio-political glue of human civilisation.""

""How can you say that? things have changed a bit in the last... huh?...""

""Deja vu? Let me help you out there. You were about to point out that dirty old dogmatic theocracies and absolute monarchies have been replaced by shiny new social democracies and constitutional monarchies based on secular post-enlightenment ideas of liberty, equality and whatnot. And I was going to point out that, though belief systems evolve along with the corresponding society, there always remains a perpetual existential need for them. That need is so strong that, when the traditional European belief systems struggled to cope with the declining religiosity of the population, political idealism had to fill the vacuum, resulting in some of the worst mass-murdering, genocidal atrocities folk have ever inflicted on each other. This led to a backlash against secular belief systems, and the re-emergence of dogmatic theocracies in many parts of the developing world, which the western world was only too happy to aggressively encourage with overt and covert foreign policies. Why? Because it was no longer necessary for the weaker tribe to adopt the same religion as the stronger tribe. Nowadays, developing countries can have any religion they want and any rules they want to control their folk, since their subservience is guaranteed by following the same economic rules and adopting the same economic belief system - hence, capitalism. Meanwhile, in the western world, capitalism, globalism and overpopulation have enabled folk to become less philanthropic, xenophobic, homophobic and misogynistic, and libertarianism and individualism have enabled folk to create their own belief systems. So, instead of living in a tribal society, we're living in a society of tribes, held together by a permanently interacting web of different belief systems. Are you still with me?""

""Just about.""

""Good. Now, consider belief system 'A', and belief system, 'B'. Historically speaking, A doesn't see B, and B doesn't see A. A sees not-A, and B sees not-B, you see? This is even more true when they're the result of a schism, and there're plenty of wars that prove it, but blind faith has been an evolutionarily successful trait throughout human history, where encounters between belief systems have usually led to one of two outcomes - either minimal contact and toleration, for trade purposes, or the complete enslavement or annihilation of one by the other. But, when A and B are part of a permanently interacting web of different belief systems, toleration and minimal contact aren't going to maintain peace for very long and the stubborn persistence of modern communication technology makes enslavement or annihilation almost impossible - although some states are still determined to give it fucking good crack. Nevertheless, fundamentally, in a society of tribes, blind faith is no longer a successful trait - A has to see B and B has to see A.""

""I'll bear that in mind, Ma, but I'm not sure how it... helps me.""

""Deja vu, again? I'm sorry, I do tend to go off on one, don't I? But don't worry, I'm getting to you. Consider a variable 'X', representing any random belief system. For the purpose of argument, therefore, we can define the belief system of a nihilist as not-X. Traditionally, when A finds not-X in it's environment, it just sees not-A, so there's no difference from finding B, or any X that isn't A. It just gets ignored or exiled or burnt at the fucking stake, or something - problem solved. But if A starts to see not-A for the B it really is, it also sees not-X for what it really is, which a gap in the permanently interacting web of belief systems it lives in. So, for the first time in history, not-X is an anomaly that an X doesn't know how to deal with - A wonders if not-X marks someone out as a criminal, B wonders if not-X marks someone out as a victim, and they both wonder if not-X marks the spot where the fucking money's buried.""

""What does Ma wonder?""

""Ma wonders if not-X sees not-Y or not-not-X?""

""Why?""

""Well, that's cleared that up.""

""Then clear this up for me - you said we met when I was a kid.""

""That we did, when I came over to stay with my da, do you not remember a pretty little Irish girl with big brown eyes and big soft titties? No? Well you must've been too young to notice, I was a right little prick-tease, so I was.""

""Was it here?""

""No, that pub that used to be on Picasso Road, where they built the new wasteland. I went there a few times with that boy with the spiky hair and the VW badge on a chain, like the Beastie Boys, you know. You'd be sat outside reading your book and we'd wait for your da to bring you a bottle of Coke and packet of Monster Munch, so we could get him to buy our drinks for us.""

""I don't remember you and Beastie Boy, but you've just described the last memory I have of my dad, he must have been killed not long after that.""

""That's right, I was back in Ireland by then but my da mentioned it in one of his letters. It must be bad enough losing a parent at that age without the added pressure of them being a martyr.""

""'It's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.'""

""Well, my da was pretty cut up about it at the time, he blamed himself for not going on the protest march. I cried for them both when I read that letter. It made me realise there's more to life than booze and beastie boys - changed my life, so it did. You're right though, we shouldn't hold ourselves to the highest standards of others.""

""That's not what I meant. It was all a lie - he wasn't a martyr, he was a bastard!"" More angry about this than he'd first realised, K apologised for raising his voice and repeated his brother's recent revelation about their father. ""...so your dad had nothing to feel guilty about... I'm sorry.""

""Don't be, my da had plenty to feel guilty about and if your ma's lie helped me sort my life out, I wish she was still alive for me to thank her. Remember what I said - however much the world changes, humans will always carry the legacy of the past with them. And guess what? most of it's bullshit.

“With Love, Meghan” is Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s entry into the world of cooking and lifestyle shows, on the shoulders of giants such as Julia Child, Martha Stewart, Ina Garten and Samin Nosrat. This isn’t her first foray into food media. She launched the website The Tig, “a hub for the discerning palate,” back when she was an actress on “Suits.” (She [shut it down](https://thetig.com/) when she entered British royal life.) If we’re being honest, though, many viewers are more likely tuning in to glean gossip regarding the self-evicted royals than to learn how to gussy up a coffee creamer or otherwise elevate the everyday.

Let’s first dispense with the burning questions. Does her husband, Prince Harry, appear on the show? Yes, briefly, in the eighth episode, during her garden party. There are also inoffensive anecdotes about him peppered through the rest of the show, similar to her sprinkle of hemp hearts over roasted carrots “for texture.” Does the show reveal anything new about the Sussexes or the royal family? Not particularly.

The show spends significantly more time focused on her love of crudités and edible flowers. For the most part, Meghan takes on the role of teacher and also, stealth salesperson. She keeps bringing up flower sprinkles, putting them on a bevy of sweet and savory bites. Turns out, those very same sprinkles have just been unveiled as part of the product line for her lifestyle brand, [As Ever](https://people.com/meghan-markle-as-ever-product-line-unveiled-cookies-teas-jam-more-11689137) (formerly known as American Riviera Orchard). So are the preserves, teas and cookies that feature heavily in “With Love, Meghan.” This show, which premiered on Tuesday, is a piece of her and Harry’s ongoing $100 million, 5-year deal with Netflix, which is set to expire at the end of this year. There are eight episodes, each about 30 minutes long and there’s a guest or gathering she hosts in each.

There is so much to discuss here. That’s why we’ve gathered — fashion critic Rachel Tashjian and The Home You Own reporter Rachel Kurzius — to chat about what “With Love, Meghan” made us think.

**Rachel Kurzius:** The first thing that struck me from “With Love, Meghan” is how much the show highlights her joy doing the kinds of tasks that the royal family pays professionals to do. She gives tips on arranging florals in multiple episodes. She collects honey in a full-on beekeeper outfit. She gathers eggs from the backyard chicken coop that appeared in her and Harry’s famous Oprah interview. She plans menus and writes them out by hand in her gorgeous loopy script. This show is a major step in her bid to lean into her identity as a lifestyle influencer. Ironically enough, influencers are about as close as we get to royalty these days in America.

**Rachel Tashjian:** With Meghan, it’s always hard to tell whether she is trying to be relatable or trying to impress us. (I suppose it could be one in the same.) I initially had this idea — and I’ve read a lot of her interviews, listened to her podcast and read Tina Brown’s book — that she was quite basic. But in fact her taste is very baroque. Perhaps even rococo?! She is doing nonstop elaborate hobbies crafts: making candles, beekeeping, cake making, tea brewing! And while I love domestic goddess striving and do it myself, her quest for perfection has me grinding my teeth.

**RK:** In the first episode, Meghan makes bath salts and truffle popcorn out of a wreath-worthy corn husk for an old friend who will be staying overnight. It immediately reminded me of Nara Smith, the fashion model turned influencer who whips up an ice cream sundae, for instance, by making the ice cream, hot fudge, vanilla wafers and even the sprinkles from scratch, all while wearing outrageous fashions. But while Smith’s vibe seems purposefully out of reach, Meghan is trying to straddle two worlds here. In the same episode, she also pours peanut butter pretzels from one bag, into another. Riveting stuff! The lifestyle she’s displaying is at turns aspirational and mundane. She talks a lot about all the ways viewers can do exactly what she’s doing, but I’m not sure how realistic that is.

**RT:** Right. Are we supposed to be wowed, or are we supposed to try to do this at home? The children’s birthday party seemed quite kid-unfriendly, and Meghan and Mindy Kaling ended up celebrating together.

**RK:** Yes! They’re in a stunning Montecito greenhouse talking about how a person could easily buy some of these place settings at a flea market. The place settings were not what made that an impressive scene! In another episode, she visits a flower mart and shows how to build a quite beautiful and quite large floral centerpiece. Sure, I probably could do that, but just how much did all those flowers cost? Meghan’s constant refrain is that “it’s not about perfection” even as it’s about a very particular kind of perfectly imperfect aesthetic.

This show is clearly in conversation with the titans of this genre. The copper pots hanging on the wall reminded me of [Child’s famous pegboard wall](https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/10/02/julia-child-kitchen-renovation/). Meghan’s “If you have heirlooms, that’s fine” felt like a callback to Garten’s famous “store-bought is fine” ethos on “Barefoot Contessa,” only reversed. (Plus, she spends a good portion of the show barefoot.) The point of all these shows, including “With Love, Meghan,” is that you’re one of the guests they invite to join them.

Markle brings us into a rented mansion in Montecito where the kitchen is a well-dressed set reminiscent of a Nancy Meyers movie — she namechecks Meyers herself. [She told People](https://people.com/meghan-markle-intimate-interview-prince-harry-kids-as-ever-brand-netflix-series-exclusive-11689103) she made that choice to protect her kids: “Our kitchen is where Mama just cooks for the family, and with a crew of 80-plus people, that’s a lot of people to have in your house!” I certainly respect that, but it makes the resulting show feel a little more flat. The promise is we see her hosting, but we know it’s a set. She’s constantly going out to the spectacular garden to get greens for the salads, herbs for garnishes and tomatoes on the vine for roasting. But who is actually tending to that garden? Rachel, would you want to be a guest there?

**RT:** When I go to a wealthy friend’s house, I want to be enjoying an outrageous glass of wine or two while gazing on their finest vista or sitting in their insane sofa admiring their Lalanne hippo bar cart. I don’t want to be earning my craft badge!

**RK:** One thing that I unironically loved was how on-the-nose the music selection was. This is [such a Netflix thing](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/selling-sunset-songs-music) and it always cracks me up. The first needle drop is the song “Big Red Machine,” from Phoenix, Fleet Foxes and Anaïs Mitchell during her big beekeeping moment. “How do you stay in that tower? How do you reckon your own power?” the lyrics say, more pointed than most of the show’s dialogue about her time as a royal. As she dusts a doughnut with sugar, the Archies’ “Sugar, Sugar” comes on. “Da’ Dip” plays while she’s, you guessed it, making dips.

What did you make of the crafting of the show itself?

**RT:** I was confused about where we were and why. We see Meghan with her guests and then a different outfit is our only clue that we’re looking at her on a different day, preparing for those guests. Can I put on my (handcrafted, artisanal) tinfoil hat for a moment? I think the editing is in part to protect her from criticism. She goes out of her way to make the cake on her own in the first episode which she decorates with her friend. And I think she wanted to prove to us that, yes haters, SHE MADE THE CAKE!

The lack of labels on the milk, beer and fruits really threw me off. It was all just too perfect. Where did it come from? Isn’t this a show about sourcing?!

**RK:** The label thing stuck out to me too — especially when she was making cocktails for her mah-jongg girlies. Netflix normally loves some product placement. I was surprised not to see a particular liquor brand pony up for a spot on the counter. Maybe she wants the focus to be on those glass jars because there’s a bunch of As Ever products in there.

The moments in the show where Meghan positions herself as the student rather than the teacher felt most promising to me. In the third episode, chef Roy Choi teaches her how to make Korean fried chicken. He gave some tips about, for example, what the batter consistency should resemble that I will genuinely take with me on my own culinary journey. But those moments don’t happen all too often.

The structure of “With Love, Meghan” makes her more often the voice of authority, though it’s often unclear what authority she has. For instance, she admits she only tried making focaccia a few weeks prior, so it feels odd to have her give a lesson. When she makes candles and doughnuts, she says it’s her first rodeo altogether. One of her coolest skills — her calligraphy — is on display in the show’s branding and with her endless label making and menu writing, but the audience never gets a lesson. Her main takeaway is that we ought to add more whimsy to our lives and especially our plates, but I think she’s really overstating how much edible flowers impact my mood (and I’m pretty into whimsy!). If this show gets a second season, her taking on the role of curious student would be a better tack to take. Rachel, what do you think would improve a hypothetical season 2?

**RT:** I agree with you: I want more Meghan learning from her A-list friends. Again, what’s the tone here? Is she a domestic genius with all the coolest friends in the world (a la Gwyneth) or a down-to-earth woman who wants her busy life to be more elegant, filled with prettier stuff who has access to extraordinary expertise? It seems like she can’t make up her mind.

At the same time … I am fascinated. I spent 20 minutes talking to friends about the allegory of her cake being “naked” but interesting “only if you dig deep” (!!!) and I love when a woman uses a domestic act as propaganda. Again, I’ve taken in as much Meghan content as possible, and here I found her at her most strategic, most manipulative, most revealing.

**RK:** In preparation for this conversation, I gave all eight episodes my full attention. But in any other instance, this would likely be atmospheric television for me. Watching while candle making or crostini decorating sounds fitting, but let’s be honest, despite the entreaties of this show, I’m much more likely to be folding laundry.

# What readers are saying

The comments overwhelmingly criticize Meghan Markle's new show, highlighting its perceived disconnect from the economic struggles faced by many people. Commenters express frustration with the show's focus on wealth and privilege, deeming it tone-deaf and unrelatable. Many also question the authenticity and relevance of the content, suggesting that Markle's attempts to portray a relatable lifestyle fall flat. There is a general sentiment that the show is a waste of resources and that Markle and Prince Harry's public endeavors contradict their stated desire for privacy.",58,1741184679.0,SaintMeghanMarkle,31,0.98,False
1j4480y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1j4480y/joe_k_part_16/,Joe K - Part 16,"The rapidly fading memory of another crazy dream proceeded the breaking of the dawn's anamnesis - Katie may be back in his life but Broker was definitely out. He felt like a puppet whose strings had been cut. What had the journalist really done for him anyway? at least the lawyer had got his books back. Now he was stringless, as well as Ohm-less, and back in control of his life, at least the waking part of it. ""I don't need any knight in shining armour,"" he told himself. ""I'll fight my own battles.""

After coffee, the first thing he did was call the police force's general enquiry hotline to see if there'd been any progress on his case. The phone rang for five minutes, then an electronic voice ran through a series increasingly obscure options until he followed the instruction to - ""Press nine for ongoing case enquiries."" Ten minutes later, a fast-speaking, distant-sounding, roughly-accented, male voice said a lot of things K could barely understand before asking him to hold. Fifteen minutes later, it came back and asked him for his case number. ""I haven't been given a case number.""

""So, you should have been given a case number... is it on your phone?""

""Not unless it's a serial number.""

""In your text messages.""

""I don't have any text messages.""

""Email?""

""I don't have any emails.""

""I see... so, do you require any *special* assistance?""

""No, thank you, I just need an up...""

""Name?""

""Joe K.""

""Address?""

""Flat 42, North Block, Malevich Square, Glowbridge, GB6 7XF.""

""So, I'm going to have to ask you some security questions... So, what was the name of your first pet?""

""I've never owned a pet.""

""...So, where did you first go on holiday?""

""...Cuba?""

""...So, what can we do for you today, Mr K?""

""I just need an update on my case.""

""So, I'm looking at your case details now... So, I'm going to have to transfer you to a different department, bear with us."" K was put on hold for a further twenty minutes.

""Special Assistance, my name is Paula. How may I help you, today?"" said a slow-speaking, clear-sounding, smoothly-accented, female voice.

""I just need an update on my case.""

""No problem. Are you able to tell me your case number?""

""I don't have a case number.""

""That's fine. Are you able to tell me your name?""

""Joe K.""

""That's great. Are you able to tell me your address, Joe?""

""Flat 42, North Block, Malevich Square, Glowbridge, GB6 7XF.""

""That's great. Now, we need to go through some security questions, is that OK, Joe?""

""Cuba.""

""That's a nice name, is it a dog?""

""No, it's a country, it's where I went on holiday as a kid - I've never owned a pet.""

""That's fine... It's asking me for your first car, Joe - can you remember?""

""I don't drive.""

""That's fine... How about the first album you ever bought?""

""...*People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm*.""

""...Too many characters... could it be something else?""

""...*Screamadelica*?""

""...No, that's not it... could it be something else?""

""...I've got it - *Sign o' the Times*.""

""...No, that's not it, we've got one more attempt left, Joe, would you like to try again?""

""Never mind.""

""... No, that's not it, either. I'm sorry, Joe, but your file has been locked down for security reasons. Would you like me to transfer you to our fraud department?""

""No, that's fine.""

""That's fine. Is there anything else I can help you with today?""

""No... thank you.""

""That's great. You have a good day, Joe.""

""You too, Paula."" K hung up and called Clean Knows to tell them he was available for work again, for any client except one, and wrote their contact number on a piece of paper he dropped into Katie's mailbox on his way out.

He went for a long walk in the morning sunshine, defiantly staring down the CCTV cameras and ignoring the zephyrs and black helicopters, determined not to let any outside forces, real or imaginary, bother him again. As he took a leisurely stroll around Bosch Gardens, he watched the squirrels frolicking in the trees, with nothing but birdsong in his ears and even less on his mind. On a bench by a stream, he spent fifty minutes of solitude reading *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, until a friendly beagle came to say hello. An old man with a wooden walking stick apologised for his dog's intrusion then sat down and asked him if his book was any good and what it was about. They spent fifteen minutes mentioning books to each other that they failed to have any mutual experience of, then the old man spent a further five minutes moaning about his lazy son-in-law and kids today, and K wished him a good day and continued his long walk around the quiet back roads and along the riverbank. By the time he reached the cafe on Kandinsky Road, he'd built up enough of an appetite to satisfy it with an all-day breakfast.

When he got home, he took a couple of leaping pills and lay down on his bed, listening to anything on the radio except phone-ins - some refreshingly light comedy, some surprisingly dark comedy, some old music that wasn't the usual songs they endlessly repeat on every commercial station and some new music that wasn't just three minutes of instantly forgettable monotony. After he finished Marquez's homonymous epic, he had a coffee break with a couple of digestives, before losing himself in the everyday tragedy of John Williams' *Stoner*. In the evening, he had a beer and watched the third episode of the slightly disappointing and increasingly far-fetched second series of a mystery drama whose first series had been very good, the start of true crime documentary that was more of a promotional film for a universal DNA database, and the end of *The Deer Hunter*. Then he went to bed, read some more, and went to sleep. It was a great day. One nil to K.

It was three nil when his walk took him into the vicinity of the Black Bottom. He was sat in the Thelonious Monk booth, warming himself up with a coffee and *Pale Fire* when *The Afterglow* landed on the table. K's blank expression stared back at him. ""I thought I recognised that face,"" said Ma Rheaney. He pushed the newspaper away, his recently re-established, blissful anonymity floating away on his sighing breath. Worse still was, four days after vowing to permanently sever his ties with Broker, his unwelcome presence came crashing back into K's consciousness via Pearl Goolie's article. ""You've already read it, then?"" He shook his head.

""That would be a bit narcissistic, wouldn't it?"" was his excuse.

""I wouldn't worry that, it doesn't really say much about you.""

""Huh? What's it about then?""

""An altruistic, magnanimous and courageous local politician, sticking up for the disenfranchised, honest, salt of the Earth, working folk, unjustly accused of wrongdoing by a public service which failed in its duty of care and treated him so badly that a long-term impact on the already vulnerable state of his mental health was almost inevitable, but if you vote for me... is the gist of it. The only thing that says anything about you is the photograph, and all that says is - 'look, he's white man'... So, has it made your mental health any less vulnerable?""

""Is that special offer still on?"" said K. Ma sat down opposite him. ""When we first met I was a criminal, now I'm a victim.""

""When we first met you were a shy little boy who always had his head in a book. I'd say you haven't changed much in the last forty years, so I wouldn't worry too much about what label other folk want to put on you - it usually says more about them than it does about you. You may be a victim, you may be a criminal. You may be a nihilist, like the article says.""

""'I've got *nothing*, Ma, to live up to.'""

""True enough - even without your own belief system, other folk are still going to want to fit you into their own. But you can't really blame them, it's all about survival, like it always has been. However much the world changes, humans will always carry the legacy of the past with them.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well, you might think overpopulation is a big problem now but, thousands of years ago, underpopulation was an even bigger problem. Humans had gone and evolved big fucking brains in big fucking heads and a lot of womenfolk were dying in childbirth. On top of that, menfolk were competitive, jealous and aggressive. On top of that you had other tribes coming in and killing your menfolk and abducting your womenfolk to improve their own populations. So to be successful, a tribe needed to be able to control its members - you needed to have rules governing human behaviour. A rule against stealing other folk's food and a rule demanding that you share your own food with other folk. A rule against killing members of your own tribe and a rule demanding that you kill members of a rival tribe. A rule against homosexuality and a rule demanding that you procreate as much as humanly possible. So, a successful tribe had to be philanthropic, xenophobic, homophobic and misogynistic. Now, over time, whichever tribe could enforce rules like these most effectively was obviously going to have an advantage, and rules that have existed for generations and were originally given to the tribe by a god-like ancestor who could punish them for disobedience, in this life or the next, would prove to be an extremely effective way of controlling folk. Tribes like this became so successful that other tribes had no choice but to become subservient to them if they wanted to survive at all, and that meant following the same rules and adopting the same belief system - hence, religion. As the population increased and tribes evolved into city-states, these belief systems became ever more entrenched in the psychology of human societies, surviving the rise and fall of empires and the agricultural and industrial revolutions to remain the socio-political glue of human civilisation.""

""How can you say that? things have changed a bit in the last... huh?...""

""Deja vu? Let me help you out there. You were about to point out that dirty old dogmatic theocracies and absolute monarchies have been replaced by shiny new social democracies and constitutional monarchies based on secular post-enlightenment ideas of liberty, equality and whatnot. And I was going to point out that, though belief systems evolve along with the corresponding society, there always remains a perpetual existential need for them. That need is so strong that, when the traditional European belief systems struggled to cope with the declining religiosity of the population, political idealism had to fill the vacuum, resulting in some of the worst mass-murdering, genocidal atrocities folk have ever inflicted on each other. This led to a backlash against secular belief systems, and the re-emergence of dogmatic theocracies in many parts of the developing world, which the western world was only too happy to aggressively encourage with overt and covert foreign policies. Why? Because it was no longer necessary for the weaker tribe to adopt the same religion as the stronger tribe. Nowadays, developing countries can have any religion they want and any rules they want to control their folk, since their subservience is guaranteed by following the same economic rules and adopting the same economic belief system - hence, capitalism. Meanwhile, in the western world, capitalism, globalism and overpopulation have enabled folk to become less philanthropic, xenophobic, homophobic and misogynistic, and libertarianism and individualism have enabled folk to create their own belief systems. So, instead of living in a tribal society, we're living in a society of tribes, held together by a permanently interacting web of different belief systems. Are you still with me?""

""Just about.""

""Good. Now, consider belief system 'A', and belief system, 'B'. Historically speaking, A doesn't see B, and B doesn't see A. A sees not-A, and B sees not-B, you see? This is even more true when they're the result of a schism, and there're plenty of wars that prove it, but blind faith has been an evolutionarily successful trait throughout human history, where encounters between belief systems have usually led to one of two outcomes - either minimal contact and toleration, for trade purposes, or the complete enslavement or annihilation of one by the other. But, when A and B are part of a permanently interacting web of different belief systems, toleration and minimal contact aren't going to maintain peace for very long and the stubborn persistence of modern communication technology makes enslavement or annihilation almost impossible - although some states are still determined to give it fucking good crack. Nevertheless, fundamentally, in a society of tribes, blind faith is no longer a successful trait - A has to see B and B has to see A.""

""I'll bear that in mind, Ma, but I'm not sure how it... helps me.""

""Deja vu, again? I'm sorry, I do tend to go off on one, don't I? But don't worry, I'm getting to you. Consider a variable 'X', representing any random belief system. For the purpose of argument, therefore, we can define the belief system of a nihilist as not-X. Traditionally, when A finds not-X in it's environment, it just sees not-A, so there's no difference from finding B, or any X that isn't A. It just gets ignored or exiled or burnt at the fucking stake, or something - problem solved. But if A starts to see not-A for the B it really is, it also sees not-X for what it really is, which a gap in the permanently interacting web of belief systems it lives in. So, for the first time in history, not-X is an anomaly that an X doesn't know how to deal with - A wonders if not-X marks someone out as a criminal, B wonders if not-X marks someone out as a victim, and they both wonder if not-X marks the spot where the fucking money's buried.""

""What does Ma wonder?""

""Ma wonders if not-X sees not-Y or not-not-X?""

""Why?""

""Well, that's cleared that up.""

""Then clear this up for me - you said we met when I was a kid.""

""That we did, when I came over to stay with my da, do you not remember a pretty little Irish girl with big brown eyes and big soft titties? No? Well you must've been too young to notice, I was a right little prick-tease, so I was.""

""Was it here?""

""No, that pub that used to be on Picasso Road, where they built the new wasteland. I went there a few times with that boy with the spiky hair and the VW badge on a chain, like the Beastie Boys, you know. You'd be sat outside reading your book and we'd wait for your da to bring you a bottle of Coke and packet of Monster Munch, so we could get him to buy our drinks for us.""

""I don't remember you and Beastie Boy, but you've just described the last memory I have of my dad, he must have been killed not long after that.""

""That's right, I was back in Ireland by then but my da mentioned it in one of his letters. It must be bad enough losing a parent at that age without the added pressure of them being a martyr.""

""'It's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.'""

""Well, my da was pretty cut up about it at the time, he blamed himself for not going on the protest march. I cried for them both when I read that letter. It made me realise there's more to life than booze and beastie boys - changed my life, so it did. You're right though, we shouldn't hold ourselves to the highest standards of others.""

""That's not what I meant. It was all a lie - he wasn't a martyr, he was a bastard!"" More angry about this than he'd first realised, K apologised for raising his voice and repeated his brother's recent revelation about their father. ""...so your dad had nothing to feel guilty about... I'm sorry.""

""Don't be, my da had plenty to feel guilty about and if your ma's lie helped me sort my life out, I wish she was still alive for me to thank her. Remember what I said - however much the world changes, humans will always carry the legacy of the past with them. And guess what? most of it's bullshit. Lies makes us what we are, and, in some cases, they makes us what we aren't. Your ma didn't lie to you to preserve the positive influence of what your da wasn't, but to protect you from the negative influence of what he was - and for the money, of course, she was no fucking fool, your ma.""",1,1741184675.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

Masaru is able to remove anyone's face and use his abilities, he is also able to copy faces 

Masaru was Ochako's first boyfriend Masaru is let's say special, let's say he's the typical weird boy who has the face to do a shooting.

He was Ochako's boyfriend for a few weeks, she dumped him because... well, Masaru's mother actively practices witchcraft. 

Masaru's mother cursed her son because he is quirkless, she used to see what they did to her son so that's why she made a pact with Maka-Mala-Mahakai so that her son would have a quirk.

the third ex is Honemaru Fuma or nicknamed as ""the living dead""   


Honemaru's quirk allows him to regenerate like a zombie his skin is a mosaic of scars, parts joined with suture, parts of different colors from different corpses that who knows how they got there... Honemaru is the creepiest Ochako said that she went out with him just for curiosity... and it really is terrifying Honemaru is that he has died several times but always comes back.

Honemaru's family owns a funeral home.  
  
Honemaru for some reason wears a gas mask all the time, this is because although he regenerates all the time his lungs do not and his parents gave him that gas mask connected to a special device so he can breathe.  
  
The fourth exes well they are two conjoined twins    
  
Yukina and Misaki Todoroki.  
  
Ochako went out with these two because she was still curious... yes.  
  
The quirk of these two crazy girls is like Shoto's but 10 times more dangerous since both twins have perfected versions of their quirks, this is because the father of these two and Shoto's uncle used genetic engineering to create them.  
  
Yukina can control fire she is let's say the normal one of the duo, she is somewhat dumb, but she sees the positive side to everything.  
  
Misaki on the other hand can control ice... but she is terrifying she is monosyllabic and usually talks about how we are all going to die and that no one escapes eternal oblivion she usually carries a voodoo doll of those she faces In turn, when she is near the air gets cold and those who are near these twins start to sweat cold.  
  
Tomorrow I will upload the other 4 exes and their quirks/abilities that look like quirks but are not.

All of these evil exes only dated Ochako for weeks, so the way to list them is by weeks, for example  
  
Masaru only lasted a week and so on with the others  
  
Ochako didn't date too much with these evil exes too often because she and her family used to move a lot from prefecture to prefecture, town to town because of their work.",2,1741184449.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False
