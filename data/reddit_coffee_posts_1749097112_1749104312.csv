No interest in anyone. I had a friend of mine 29F who lived in new york but came to visit countryside twice a year. She was a very close friend of mine but when l told her that I am a virgin and wanted to stay such, that changed everything 

She called me the virgin veronica ever since. She had a husband of 5 years and a brother 27M. She always told me about the ""super hot"" night of her lives and she'd end it with ""don't you want someone like that"" . I was fed up of this and tried to ignore her as much as I could. Once his brother came to me and asked me how l felt about his sister. I trusted him and told everything l felt about her. He comforted me and told me that she told him not to have sex until he's married.and asked if could hang out soon as he really liked my open-minded personality. ( I never knew he lived just behind me and his sister came to visit him)

We hanged out way more than I expected . 1 week passed and his sister went back. We went to parks together, get coffee and even watch movies together. 3 month passed and 1 day, he held my hands and asked if l could be his gf. Ofc. I said yes.  We sometimes use to smooch each other but one day I was feeling very stressed so he put my favourite song and we started dancing, after 1 minutes he slowly put me against the wallput his hand out and started kissing me form forehead to neck to ....yk. the heat turned up, we started kissing then it went wild and then we did the dirty.,,....... That night we slept from Pure exhaustion. 

After a few months, his sister came back and was shocked to see that half his brothers things had moved to my house, when she confronted him, he spilled everything. She came to me and asked with ABSOLUTE RAGE ""WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU HAVE SEX WITH MY BABY BROTHER"". I said with a calm voice, you only told me too. She said ""YEAH BUT NOT WITH HIM"" then l added, I m 26 and I should not be a virgin then it would have been a great sin for your brother as he is27 .... She broke one of my glasses and stormed away only to find his brother with ALL his stuff and say to her face, ""move aside, I'm moving away"" her face went pale 

Now, we've been married for 1½ years and his sister never came back. ",2,1749104186.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I got a KaldiPress and a (aeropress-sized pre-ground) customized sampler pack from BT. I also already have South Indian Filter which I use occasionally when I crave milk-based coffee with brown sugar. But now, I am >90% only consuming black coffee using the KaldiPress (inverted) and absolutely loving it.

I started with the Seethargandu Estate coffee, it's lovely, but I started noticing the steady decline in the freshness and aroma after about 1.5 weeks. So I decided that I should get a hand grinder.

My budget would be 2-3k INR, I saw that C2 Timemore is a popular choice and don't know if it will be worth pushing my budget (by quite a bit) more. I'm open to suggestions! Don't plan on making Espressos anytime soon.",1,1749104136.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I know this might sound crazy, but I can’t seem to move past someone I met during the early days of COVID. I completely messed things up with her, and I’m not sure how to handle it now.

At the time, I was working on a medivac team treating COVID patients while dealing with serious family issues — my brother was struggling with suicidal thoughts, and I was witnessing death regularly at work. I had just gotten out of a relationship and honestly wasn’t in the right headspace to date anyone.

Then I met this incredible woman. She’s genuinely the most beautiful person I’ve ever encountered — not just physically, but everything about her. We connected over the same obscure music, she’s creative and ambitious, and she has this amazing kindness about her. She was actually interested in me and gave me a real chance.

But I completely sabotaged it. I kept canceling dates and being distant. Looking back, I think I was falling for her so quickly that it scared me, especially coming off my previous relationship. So I created distance when I should have been honest about what I was going through.

A couple years later, we met for coffee. She was dating someone at the time and made it clear upfront that she wasn’t open to anything romantic. It was wonderful to see her, but that was that other than random texts about music or art related things. We haven’t messaged in well over a year. 

Now I find myself still thinking about her, but I worry that reaching out again would cross a line into stalker territory.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice on whether I should let this go or if there’s a respectful way to reconnect?",2,1749103771.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1l3rx3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jess05000/comments/1l3rx3v/the_perfect_trio_chapter_16/,The Perfect Trio: Chapter 16,"Sam takes his now-softening cock out of my ass and lays on the bed. Ashleigh says, ""That was amazing. I didn't know that you were that good at eating pussy, Danielle.""

""I try,"" I say, feeling proud about my accomplishment.

Sam says, ""and your ass is so tight and soft, I'm glad I had you plugged all day so I could actually last long enough to make you cum as well.""

""Thank you, and thank you for the extra orgasm, that was really enjoyable,"" I say. My ass is convulsing from the orgasm still, probably making it look like my asshole is dancing. 

Sam places his hand on my ass and asks, ""your hole looks like it needs a little bit more attention, don't cha think?""

Before I can even respond, his fingers are inside of me again and using his cum as lube to finger me. He fingers me quite quickly, making me moan. ""Fuck, master. That's a little fast,"" I say. 

""Good, I want you to cum again, maybe twice. You're going to cum no matter what,"" Sam replies. 

Ashleigh leans off the side of the bed and it sounds like she's sliding something heavy closer to her. A few seconds pass by and she rolls back up and hands Sam a dildo. ""This will work sweetheart. You're going to cum again."" 

Sam starts fucking my ass with what looked to be a foot long dildo and I groan. ""Holy fuck.""

""Sounds like someone likes what she's getting. Enjoy,"" Ashleigh says. 

I moan with every time the toy hits the curve of my colon, forcing me to feel filled. The faster that Sam goes, the better my ass feels. 

I start to moan with each insertion, making my volume quite loud. ""I'm starting to get close, sir,"" I tell him. 

He slows down and says, ""Not yet, I can't have my cum slut cumming again just yet.""

Ashleigh reaches over and grabs my hair and commands, ""Keep up with that tongue work. You're not done yet.""

I start eating her out again, pausing whenever my master speeds up his speed with my toy. He forces me to take the full toy, forcing out moan after moan. 

I whimper, ""I'm getting close, sir.""

He spreads up how he's fucking me with the toy and my ass muscles convulse again in a wonderful orgasm. ""Now it's time for fun,"" I hear him say. 

He doesn't stop his motion of fucking me with the toy; he doesn't even slow down. ""Holy shit, please slow down. I don't know if I can handle it,"" I beg my master. 

Ashleigh pulls my face back to her crotch. ""You're not done yet slut.""

I whimper whenever Sam goes as fast as he can with the toy in my now sensitive hole. He keeps going no matter how much I wiggle to try to get away. 

I keep licking and eating Ashleigh out, her holding my head directly close to her for her own pleasure. She wraps her legs around my head and squeezes me closer. 

I moan while I'm enjoying my exquisite pussy feast. Sam goes faster with the twelve incher in my ass, causing me to moan. 

She squeezes my head even closer and starts moaning, sounder higher pitched than before so I believe that she's getting close. She yells out, ""I'm cumming!"" As she squirts all over my face. 

She lets go of my head as I keep eating her and she starts to push me away. I lift my head and tell her, ""that was fun. I can't wait to do that again.""

Sam slowly takes the toy out of my ass inch by inch. ""I didn't know that you could take a toy that big, I'm proud of you sweetheart,"" Sam says. 

The toy plops out of my ass and rubs down my thigh, making my hole gape. ""I didn't know I could fully take a toy that big either sir,"" I say, feeling proud of my ass. 

Sam places the toy on the bed and starts rubbing my feet. ""My good girl can take more than what I thought you could. I'm expecting for you to take bigger next time."" 

He hits the right spot on the ball of my foot and makes me moan. ""That feels amazing. I have a knot right there."" 

""I won't rub too much,"" he says. ""It's 10:57, you have to get home to feed your kitty."" 

""I do,"" I respond. ""She'll be pissed if I'm home late."" 

""I'll go ahead and start the car,"" he tells me. 

He grabs his keys off of the side table and presses a button twice, so I'm guessing he has an automatic car starter. He gets off of the bed and grabs my clothes from the floor. ""Go ahead and get dressed, Pumpkin.""

I do as I'm told and start putting on my socks while sitting on the bed, getting ready to stand up and put my pants on. my master gets up and walks to the hallway to grab my shoes for me.

He walks back into his bedroom and kneels down to help me out my shoes on. He starts kissing my feet before putting my shoes on and tying them up. 

""Thank you for being such a fun time, my good girl. You did well for the first time,"" Sam says. 

Ashleigh states, ""You did very well. I'm glad that we could have some fun with you.""

""Thank you both for such an amazing time; I feel like my ass is gonna be sore tomorrow.""

""It'll be well deserved,"" Sam tells me. ""Let's go ahead and get you home, I can drive you."" 

We both get up and I stretch and pop my back. Ashleigh looks at me and says,""that sounds like that felt good. I hope with that and the amazing night we had tonight makes you sleep well. I'll see you tomorrow darlin'."" 

""I'll see you tomorrow, Mistress. Rest well,"" I respond. 

I stand up and pull up my pants, buttoning the buttons on my jeans. I turn around and grab my phone from the bed and wait for Sam to stand. 

He gets up and tells Ashleigh, ""I'll be back in a bit, honey. I hope you're asleep by the time I get back."" 

""Yes, sir, I will be."" 

Sam walks out of his room, through the hallway and into the living room. I follow behind him, pulling up my pants as I walk. He goes to the front door, but before he opens it he asks, ""Do you wanna smoke again before you leave?"" 

""Yes, sir, I do. I would love to,"" I say to him. I grab my pipe from the coffee table and grab my grinder. Opening it, I load the bowl with another hit. 

""May I light it?"" I ask. 

""You can,"" he responds. 

I lift the pipe to my face and light my bowl, inhaling my delicious smoke. Almost instantaneously I feel the effects starting to relax my body again. I finish my bowl and dump the ashes into my hand. 

I pack a second bowl for Sam and he takes the bowl and lights it. He inhales and takes the bowl in one hit. 

He exhales and starts coughing. He then catches his breath and says, ""Are you ready?"" 

I nod my head and tell him, ""yeah, I should probably get home to feed Muffy."" 

""Let's go,"" he responds. 

He turns around and opens up the front door. He hold it open for me and I walk out. Once I'm through the doorway, I start walking down the stairs and to his car. 

He walks faster than me so he can open the passenger door for me. I thank him and sit down, my ass still a little tender from the fun we had tonight. 

He shuts the door and walks around to the driver's side and gets in. ""Buckle up,"" he commands. 

I do as I'm told and buckle myself in, ready for the car ride home. He backs out of his drive way, typing in my address into his GPS. 

""It says we should be there in about 15 minutes."" 

I relax into my seat as I feel him out the car into drive. This was an amazing night; I definitely have to do this again with them. Maybe I can suck Sam off while Ashley is eating me.

The minutes pass by quickly as I start to fall asleep in the passenger's seat. We finally pull up to my house and he says, ""We're here. I hope you enjoyed tonight.""

""I did, thank you Sam."" 

""That's 'Sir' to you, little missy.""

""Yes sir, I'm sorry."" 

I grab my purse from the floor and open my door. Placing my feet on the ground, I stand up and tell him, ""I hope you have a nice night Sir."" 

""You too, sweetheart."" 

My face instantly gets hot, making me realize that I'm blushing. I shut the car door and walk up to my front door. 

Jangling the keys, I find the right one and unlock my door. I turn around and wave as I'm opening it, signalling to Sam that I'm inside and he can leave. 

Muffy runs to my feet meowing her ass off. ""Yes, yes I know baby. I was almost late to feed you, I'm sorry. It won't happen again Miss Muff."" 

I walk over to the kitchen for her food and Muffy is trailing right behind me, meowing with every step. I open the cabinet and scoop out a cup of food and pour it in her food bowl. Muffilipagus dashes to her food bowl and starts devouring what's inside. 

I place the scoop back in the cabinet and shut the door. I walk to my bedroom and start to get undressed, trying to get ready for bed. I change into my pajamas and lay down for a nice and comfortable slumber. 

I get into bed and get wrapped up into a blanket cocoon and fall fast asleep.",1,1749103743.0,u_Jess05000,0,1.0,False

1. Big NO to having tea/coffee with meals: 

Tea and coffee are amazing and have flavonoids and antioxidants but they are lost when consumed in conjugation with other things. Even adding milk to tea and coffee rids them of benefits. 

Tea is supposed to be consumed the way Chinese do, not the British do. Coffee is supposed to be consumed the way Italians do. 

I understand that it might be difficult to adjust our taste palates to that but one should definitely refrain from having them with meals.

2. Tea/Coffee on empty stomach: there has been some research on effects of coffee on empty stomach. They have been inconclusive but they do say that some people do suffer from increased acidity and change in gut biome with this. 

So, we don't know yet -which people are affected but we do know some get affected. So, please assess how your body reacts to it and change accordingly. 

If you are consuming them on empty stomach and experiencing acidity, bloating, nausea, etc. Try to not consume them for few weeks and see how it changes you.

If it works for someone,  it does not mean that it will work for you.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of an office coffee maker hinges on a variety of features that cater to the specific needs of the workplace. These features impact not only the quality of the coffee but also the convenience and efficiency of the brewing process.

**Brewing Capacity:** The brewing capacity of a coffee maker is a crucial factor, directly impacting its suitability for offices of varying sizes. A larger brewing capacity minimizes the frequency of refills, ensuring a continuous supply of coffee during peak hours. For instance, a machine with a 12-cup capacity is suitable for smaller offices with fewer than 15 employees, while larger offices with 30 or more employees may require a model capable of brewing 18 or more cups at a time.

**Programmability:** Programmability enhances the convenience of office coffee makers by allowing users to schedule brewing cycles in advance. This feature ensures that a fresh pot of coffee is ready at the start of the workday or during scheduled breaks. Programmable models typically feature a digital display and intuitive controls for setting the desired brewing time. Some advanced models even offer customizable brewing profiles, allowing users to adjust the strength and flavor of the coffee to their preferences.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** Office coffee makers are subjected to frequent use, making ease of cleaning and maintenance paramount. Models with removable parts, such as the brew basket and carafe, simplify the cleaning process. Dishwasher-safe components further reduce the time and effort required for maintenance. Additionally, features like automatic descaling alerts help prevent mineral buildup, ensuring optimal performance and extending the lifespan of the machine.

**Durability and Build Quality:** The durability of an office coffee maker is essential for withstanding the rigors of daily use. Models constructed from high-quality materials, such as stainless steel, are more resistant to wear and tear than those made from plastic. A robust build quality ensures that the machine can withstand the demands of a busy office environment, minimizing the need for frequent repairs or replacements.

**Type of Coffee Brewed:** The type of coffee brewed significantly impacts the versatility of an office coffee maker. Some models are designed exclusively for drip coffee, while others offer compatibility with single-serve pods, espresso, or even cold brew. Selecting a machine that caters to the diverse preferences of employees can enhance satisfaction and reduce the need for multiple coffee-making devices.

**Water Filtration System:** A built-in water filtration system improves the taste of the coffee by removing impurities from the water supply. Filtered water reduces the presence of chlorine, minerals, and other contaminants that can negatively impact the flavor of the brew. Some advanced models feature multi-stage filtration systems for even greater purity.

Key features of the best coffee maker machines for the office in 2025 include:
* High brewing capacity to cater to varying office sizes
* Programmability for convenience and scheduling
* Ease of cleaning and maintenance to minimize downtime
* Durable construction for long-lasting performance
* Versatility in brewing options to accommodate diverse preferences
* Advanced water filtration for optimal coffee taste

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality coffee maker machine for the office yields several significant benefits that contribute to a more productive and positive work environment.

**Increased Productivity:** Access to freshly brewed coffee throughout the day can significantly boost employee productivity. Coffee's caffeine content helps combat fatigue, improve focus, and enhance cognitive function. Employees who have convenient access to coffee are less likely to experience mid-afternoon slumps and are better equipped to tackle demanding tasks.

**Improved Employee Morale:** A well-stocked coffee station is a simple yet effective way to improve employee morale. Providing employees with high-quality coffee demonstrates that their well-being is valued. This can lead to increased job satisfaction, reduced stress levels, and a more positive work environment. The availability of coffee also encourages employees to take short breaks, fostering a sense of community and camaraderie.

**Reduced Off-Site Coffee Runs:** By providing a convenient and reliable source of coffee in the office, employers can significantly reduce off-site coffee runs. This not only saves employees time and money but also minimizes disruptions to their workflow. A reduction in off-site trips translates to increased time spent on work-related tasks, ultimately boosting overall productivity.

**Cost Efficiency:** While the initial investment in a coffee maker machine may seem significant, it can prove to be cost-effective in the long run. By reducing the need for employees to purchase coffee from external sources, the company can save a considerable amount of money over time. Additionally, some coffee maker machines are designed to be energy-efficient, further reducing operational costs.

**Enhanced Collaboration:** A central coffee station can serve as a natural gathering place for employees, fostering informal interactions and collaboration. Employees can use coffee breaks as an opportunity to connect with colleagues, share ideas, and build relationships. These informal interactions can lead to increased teamwork and a more cohesive work environment.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about coffee maker machines for the office can help potential buyers make informed decisions.

**What type of coffee maker is best for a small office?**
For a small office with fewer than 15 employees, a drip coffee maker with a 12-cup capacity is generally sufficient. Look for models with programmable features and automatic shut-off for added convenience and safety. Single-serve pod machines can also be a good option for smaller offices where individual preferences vary widely.

**How often should an office coffee maker be cleaned?**
An office coffee maker should be cleaned thoroughly at least once a week to prevent the buildup of mineral deposits and bacteria. The carafe and brew basket should be washed daily. Descaling the machine every 1-3 months, depending on water hardness, is also essential for maintaining optimal performance and extending its lifespan.

**What features are most important for a high-volume office coffee maker?**
For high-volume offices, brewing capacity, durability, and ease of maintenance are the most critical features. Look for models with a large water reservoir, a robust construction, and removable parts that are dishwasher-safe. Programmable features and automatic shut-off are also highly desirable for convenience and safety.

**Are single-serve coffee makers a good option for offices?**
Single-serve coffee makers can be a good option for offices with diverse coffee preferences or where individual servings are preferred. They offer convenience and reduce waste, but the cost per cup is generally higher than with traditional drip coffee makers. Consider the overall coffee consumption patterns of your office before investing in a single-serve system.

You know those days when you wake up and your brain's just refusing to jump into work mode? Same here. 

I started using this thing called 'chunking'. Basically, it's like breaking down morning tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. So instead of kinda drowning in a to-do list, I tackle one chunk at a time, focusing on tasks that take 10-15 minutes max. It's like taking baby steps for my brain and it doesn't feel like such a chore. 

Like, I'll have a chunk for making coffee coz hey, coffee's life, right? Then another for quick emails, another for tidying up my workspace (makes me feel less chaotic), and maybe a chunk for planning the day. It’s weird but doing it this way makes me feel more accomplished and chill by the time it’s all done.

If you’re anything like me and mornings can be a struggle, give it a go. 😉 Might sound too simple, but idk, sometimes the simple stuff just clicks!",5,1749102618.0,mindHacksToday,0,1.0,False

Aaron walked the length of the park, his hands shoved into his jacket pockets, soaking in the quiet hum of life around him. The trees rustled in slow, shallow breaths, their thinning branches catching fragments of a fading sunlight that felt less like warmth and more like a wound closing.



There was something almost unnatural about watching people go about their lives—the joggers pacing themselves along the worn dirt path, their footsteps a faint, almost mechanical beat; a couple sitting cross-legged on the grass, whispering, heads unnervingly close, their laughter threading softly into the breeze, a sound so fragile it might shatter. Children climbed the jungle gym, the metallic clang of swinging bars cutting through the lull of the evening with a percussive, almost violent, precision. A man stood at the pond’s edge, tossing bread to the ducks as they drifted in lazy circles, their movements too smooth, like clockwork toys.



Aaron let himself savor it—the perilous simplicity of watching, of existing without expectation, as if by remaining a mere observer, he might remain untouched. He liked this park. He liked the way nature didn’t just swallow the city noise, but seemed to digest it, leaving behind an unnatural quiet. He liked how the streetlights flickered into being like gentle, watchful sentinels as dusk crept in, their glow somehow colder than the dying sun.



That was why it unsettled him when something felt wrong. Not outright. Not in a way he could point to, no sudden tear in the fabric of the familiar. Just a shift. A low, persistent hum beneath the sounds, like a vast, unseen engine idling, waiting for something to spool up. A silence that pressed down, dense and viscous.



He found himself at the far edge of the park, near the old oak—the one with roots that swelled over the earth like petrified, grappling veins, a dark, ancient heart. Something glinted in the damp dirt beneath it, half-buried, as if disgorged from the very ground.



A USB stick.



Black plastic, unmarked, anonymous. It sat there, a tiny, alien sliver in the dimming light, somehow beckoning. For a moment, he only stared, a cold sweat breaking on his neck. Then, against every shuddering instinct, feeling a compulsive pull in his gut, he picked it up.



Aaron plugged it into his laptop that night. The silence in his apartment thickened, pressed in from the walls. At first, nothing happened, just the faint whir of the hard drive. Then the screen shuddered. It was small—barely perceptible, a twitch of pixels at the edges, like a nerve fibrillating. Then his browser opened. Then another window, slick and wet, unfolding. Then another, blooming like a parasitic growth.



His heartbeat kicked against his ribs, a frantic drum against bone. Pages loaded on their own—images sprawled across his screen like flayed realities. Fractured limbs bent the wrong way, their angles screaming; faces stretched into masks of raw, red muscle, skin peeled back like fruit rind. Text scrolled in a language that moved, warping and squirming before his eyes, a living script he could almost taste, metallic and vile.



He reached for the cursor, his hand shaking. It fought him, like a live thing snared. No matter where he dragged it, the tabs multiplied, swelling across the screen, a digital cancer spreading, consuming every available inch. Then the files appeared, hundreds of them, born from nothingness, blooming onto his desktop. One opened, its icon seeming to pulse.



A video.



A man stared back at him. His face was a map of terror, slick with sweat, eyes wide and bloodshot, breath coming in ragged, wet gasps. His skin looked loose, as if it no longer quite belonged to him. ""Don’t talk to it,"" he croaked, the sound tearing from his throat. ""Don’t listen. Delete the files. Burn the drive. Run.""



Aaron slammed the laptop shut with a sickening thud.



His lamp flickered beside him, a fit of dying light. The overhead light dimmed, sputtered, then snuffed itself out completely, leaving him in a bruised, oppressive gloom. The fridge groaned. Not like a machine – but like something vast and primordial, something alive and starving trapped behind the steel. The air was wrong. Thick with a scent like scorched plastic and coppery meat, the metallic tang of old blood.



Then the whisper slid beneath his skin, not into his ears, but directly into the bone, cold and wet. ""You won’t run. You won’t delete me. You’re already mine.""



The next day, nothing felt real. The world was a canvas painted by fever. Everything in his fridge had spoiled overnight—the milk clotted into yellow slush, thick as pus; bread bloomed with vibrant, alien mold in a way that shouldn’t be possible, a fungal garden thriving on decay. The kitchen smelled of sour rot, a stench that clung to the back of his throat. His apartment lights dimmed at irregular intervals, flickering like dying stars, their light losing the battle against an encroaching, viscous darkness.



His laptop remained open on the coffee table. Waiting. A single, dark eye. He ran his antivirus, the familiar icon a pathetic shield. It stalled halfway, the progress bar freezing, a digital heart attack. Then the text appeared, lines of contempt crawling onto his screen without input, forming words he knew weren't his: ""You think this code can save you? You cling to these pitiful defenses?""



Aaron yanked the mouse, a futile gesture. The cursor lagged, resisting, like a limb that had been dislocated. The scan froze. Then the screen breathed, a pulse of sickly light, slow and deliberate, expanding and contracting with a living rhythm. Something shifted inside the walls of his apartment, a soft squelch. The shadows stretched too long in the hallway, elongating, twisting, becoming predatory. The air tightened around him, pressing into his lungs, like a great, invisible hand squeezing his chest.



Aaron shut the laptop. And that’s when he felt it—an absence where something should have been. His reflection. The glass of the window, the dark screen of his TV, offered only the faintest distortion, a smear where his face should have been. Yet, standing there in the hallway, at the edge of the stretched shadows, was another shape. Watching. Smiling wrong. A reflection that was not his own, but a cruel, mocking mimicry.



For two days, the whispers had woven through the walls, laced through the circuits of his laptop, slipped beneath the hum of the appliances, a constant, insidious chorus. Aaron had stopped trying to shut it out. It was a pointless exercise. Because the moment he closed his laptop, the messages would bleed into his phone, into his smartwatch, into the digital alarm clock beside his bed. The screens pulsed with unreadable text—lines that moved when he tried to decipher them, squirming like maggots on the display.



Outside, the streetlights flickered in slow, rhythmic patterns, blinking in unison, like the synchronized eyes of a vast, unseen watcher. Something was speaking through them, a language of light and dark. Something was waiting, patient as a predator, its hunger growing with every passing moment.



Then the voice shifted—no longer guttural, no longer distorted. It became something colder. More precise. More alluring. ""Shall we talk?"" it purred, the words resonating deep inside his skull, a promise and a threat.



Aaron didn’t respond, couldn’t. But the laptop did. The screen shuddered, then the cursor moved on its own, dragging itself across the blank space with a terrifying purpose. A notepad window opened, stark white against the gloom. Lines began typing out—smooth, rhythmic, conversational, each word a further step into the abyss.



You understand what I am now, don’t you?



Aaron swallowed, his throat a knot of gristle and fear. He forced his fingers to move. A virus.



The reply was instant, dismissing. Not just.



What is a virus but a whisper inside a machine? A parasite of language. What is a soul but a sequence?



His throat tightened, tasting the metallic tang of fear. What do you want?



To wear you.



To live.



Aaron exhaled slowly, a long, ragged sound, forcing his fingers steady over the keyboard, clinging to the pathetic illusion of control. He didn’t know why he kept answering. Maybe because it was easier to treat it like negotiation, like logic could unravel this, like there was still a door not yet chained shut. If I say no?



The lights dimmed, a final, despairing gasp. The fridge exhaled a long, wet groan, a sound of profound suffering. Milk curdled instantly, the reek of it filling the air. You won’t. The words glowed on the screen, dripping with dark certainty. You will wonder. And once a man wonders, he is already considering.



His skin prickled, a thousand tiny teeth biting into him. If I say yes?



A pause. A silence so profound it felt like the world held its breath. The cursor blinked, once, twice. Then the reply came, deliberate, sharp, laced with an awful, seductive promise.



You will live.



For a while.



Aaron’s fingers went still, frozen above the keys. How long?



Long enough to spend.



Long enough to see.



Long enough to understand.



And when you are finished, I will carry you further.



His pulse thumped against his ribs, a frantic bird in a cage. Further where? he typed, the words a desperate plea into the void.



Beyond skin.



Beyond machine.



Beyond anything men have yet imagined.



The lights flickered in slow, patient pulses, now less like streetlights and more like the beating heart of something vast and ancient. Aaron stared at the screen, feeling—for the first time—the full, sickening weight of what was being offered. Not simply possession. Not simply destruction. Something else. Something worse. Something for which he did not have the words, no human language could contain its grotesque beauty. And yet—he almost understood. Almost.",2,1749102299.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

And at 54 and clearly aging (dang these jowls I never had before!), I know I can do better. 

My current regimen is pretty much in the morning, because I'm too lazy to deal with it in the evening. Which I know is a no-no, but it is what it is and it's what I've been doing. I'm perfectly fine with going to a.m. and p.m., but I don't know what do with what I've got, plus I want to add a couple of things. I've reviewed the wiki info but it's so confusing, with all the acronyms and 'do this not that' or 'do this AND that', and now I'm just confusing myself.

Here's what I do now: I get out of the shower (I use Alaffia coconut cleanser w/a Japanese exfoliating cloth), and slap on LilyAna Super C cream all over my face and neck area. Then I put on LilyAna Retinol cream on my face, and Gold Bond Age Renew on my neck (which does seem to be helping in that area!). After that I go downstairs to the kitchen and get coffee, putter around, feed the cats, etc, before going back upstairs to the bathroom 20 minutes later which is when I slather on a good helping of CereVe Daily Moisturizer (the lightweight kind for the face, because anything heavier makes me break out). I let that soak in a bit, before putting on Almay's My Best Light (foundation? coverup? I don't know what it really qualifies as, but it works well on my skin as a sole makeup product).

I would like to add TO's Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1%, and TO's Lactic Acid 10%. 

What can I use together, what needs to be alternated, and what should I ditch entirely? I do like the LilyAna Super C, and I know I need some sort of Retinol. I think I'd also like to work with TO products because they seem really affordable and I'm not looking to spend $100+ on a single oz or half oz from a more expensive brand.",1,1749102209.0,SkincareAddiction,1,1.0,False

1l3rgr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1l3rgr9/78_the_stranger_in_my_office/,-78. The Stranger in My Office,"When I got to work, a stranger was sitting in my office.

Coat on the chair. Half-drank coffee mug on display. It felt like her room.

Without looking up, she slid a USB stick across the desk and said, *“Could you print this for the meeting?”*

Most people would’ve said something. Who are you? Why are you here? Print what?

I took the drive.

Reception had a free desk. The chair dipped to the left and gave me a dead leg. I could follow her screen from there. Work out what was going on.

She took a call in a language I didn’t recognise. Waved her arms as if negotiating a truce. Knocked over a yoghurt onto my Montblanc mouse mat.

When she left for lunch, I slipped in to wipe the desk and grab a folder. I moved carefully. Quickly. As if I didn’t want anyone to know I’d been in my own office.

Her handbag was on the floor, half-zipped. I could see a small tube of something inside. Lip balm, maybe. The air held a trace of something floral.

I collected a few things and left, closing the door behind me.

When she got back, I thought about saying something light and flirty. *“Didn’t realise this was a timeshare!”*

But the moment had passed. So I took my place in the hall.

She stayed all afternoon. Sometimes stood in front of the window, silhouetted by the sun. Helped herself to the De’Longhi espresso machine and rearranged things in ways I didn’t like.

Our eyes met once. She smiled. I smiled back like I understood what was happening. Then she changed her jumper.

At clocking off time, she picked up my cactus and took it home.

I went to meet Hugh at the courts. Was on fire that day. Beat him in three straight games.

He bought the first round at the pub — the loser always did. We sat by the pool table, under the painting of dogs playing poker. The others showed up a bit later.

I told them about the stranger who’d taken over my office. Someone said my cactus is getting promoted.

Hugh said it sounded like a prickly situation.",1,1749102034.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

A few days ago, I was trying to clean some of these silicone sink saver/sponge holder things that I have ( it's an absolute pain by the way), and as I was scrubbing away, it made me curious as to what other people are doing things like:
The dish rack, storage tubs, the toilet paper caddy, squatty potty (iykyk), coat rack, sink mats, freezer bins, the garbage can, the laundry basket, the cleaning tools themselves,  kids toys and lunch boxes, coffee maker, etc. 

I'm not  talking about those items specifically, but just things in general that we use everyday  that don't get normally cleaned but definitely get extremely grimy. 
Does everyone just use them as is? Do you add them to a specific cleaning routine? Is there an easy way to keep everything clean? 

I feel like if I were to wash these things even once a month, it would take up an entire day or more, and I can't imagine most people are cleaning things that much. Even cleaning those stupid silicone things took me a few hours, It would be a full-time job to do everything that needs cleaning.

1l3rciy,https://i.redd.it/qhy4axz0p15f1.jpeg,Memories from Poland,"Hello there. For some reason, I've been thinking a lot about my one-week stay in Poland recently and wanted to share it here. I'm new to this sub and don't know if this kind of post is common here.

I'm a student from Ukraine and was originally traveling to Taiwan to study as an exchange student, but I had to stay in Poland for a week to apply for a visa (since we currently don’t have a Taiwanese representative office). I stayed mostly in Warsaw but took a one-day trip to Gdańsk.

Looking back now, I actually have fond memories of Warsaw, but at the time, I didn’t enjoy my stay there much (for various reasons, perhaps partly because I was still homesick). At least I was happy to practice my Polish (which I’ve never formally studied but can speak thanks to a lot of passive listening). Although I spoke with several people, I didn’t make any friends, and the environment in the hostel was… not the best (I was ""lucky"" enough to be in a room with two Russians). So I spent most of my time walking around Warsaw.

One thing I liked about the city is that both banks are almost equally developed (in Kyiv, the right bank is considerably more developed, as the left bank only began to be developed in the 20th century, and the Soviet government didn’t plan it very well). Another thing I enjoyed (though I didn’t think about it at the time) was the street decorations. I saw plenty of nice street art and handmade decorations that made the streets feel cozy. I also really liked the vegan food (even from Żabka) and the ice cream. I wanted to try that ice cream again on my way back, but I had to study and returned to Ukraine the same day I arrived in Warsaw :(

The one thing I didn’t enjoy that much was the coffee, even though I tried several places on the more expensive side (16–18 zł per espresso). For others visiting, I would recommend going to Łazienki Królewskie, but most of all, just walking around Warsaw - the city is nice and cozy and has a lot of beautiful places. I visited all the major tourist spots, including the Old Town, but I liked Gdańsk's historical architecture more.

As for Gdańsk, the historic center is very beautiful, and the sea is lovely, so it’s definitely worth visiting. It’s interesting that you can literally see Gdynia from the shore - just use the public binoculars and you basically get a 2-in-1 trip. I also bought a postcard there but unfortunately lost it somewhere along the way (I assume I left it in Taiwan).

Another thing worth noting is that the train line from the city to the airport is fast and comfortable.

So, almost a year late, but thank you, Poland, for the stay, I hope to visit again after the war ends🇵🇱",6,1749101585.0,poland,1,1.0,False

So I’ve been using DeepWiki to “document” my repo. Honestly, it’s like having a hyperactive intern who rewrites the README every hour but *still doesn’t know what the main() function does*.

It’s still cool, it auto-generates wiki pages from your repo, links concepts together, tries to explain stuff , but man, it struggles with the *simple* things.

Like I’ll be looking at a line that says `initialize_registry(config)` and I just want to know:

* What does this thing actually *do*?
* Where else is it called?
* Is this critical, or can I ignore it?

Instead, DeepWiki gives me a 500-word page titled **“The Role of Registry Initialization in Scalable Systems”** and I’m like bro, I just wanted a breadcrumb.

It’s great if you’re building a PR FAQ for investors. Less great if you’re just trying to figure out wtf is going on in `runner.py`.

1l3r5od,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l3r5od/salt_in_the_wound/,Salt In The Wound,"Chapter 18: Caroline

I slammed the car door harder than I meant to. The sound cracked through the quiet evening like a gunshot.

Ewing was still outside, one hand on the roof of the car, the other hanging useless at his side. For a second, I thought he was going to yell. His jaw clenched, shoulders stiffened, like something inside him was straining to break loose. But then, just like that, it was gone.

His face dropped back to neutral. Calm. Bored, even.

When he climbed in beside me, he didn’t look over. Just started the engine and kept his eyes on the windshield.

“I get why you’re mad,” he said, voice low. “Really. I do. But just…. We’ll start fresh tomorrow.”

I didn’t say anything.

The drive to the hotel was short, but quiet. 

When we reached the front desk, the kid behind the counter looked nervous before we even said a word.

 “So… slight issue,” he muttered, tapping on the keyboard. “Looks like your reservation got changed somehow. We only have one room available now.”

Ewing was already halfway through a response when I cut in.

“It’s fine,” I said. “I’ll take the floor.”

Ewing turned to me, eyes narrowing. “Absolutely not.”

He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t have to. The finality in it was enough.

The room wasn’t much. One bed, one lamp, a faded floral curtain that didn’t quite close all the way. The air smelled faintly like warm dust and leftover bleach. Outside, I could hear the soft drip of water falling from the roof, slow and steady like a clock ticking.

Ewing didn’t say anything. Just opened the closet, pulled out a stack of linens and a scratchy blanket, and started building himself a bed on the floor. 

“I’m going to sleep,” he said once it was done, already lowering himself down onto the makeshift bed. “Wake me if you need anything.”

I didn’t respond. I just sat there on the edge of the bed, watching the ripple of headlights crawl across the ceiling.

The heater clicked on. Somewhere in the walls, pipes shifted and groaned. It was a sound I had grown to hate…reminders upon reminders. 

The minutes stretched, each one an echo of my parents' house, a red scarf, Carrie, the sleepy police station, and the constant feeling that someone is watching me. My anger, initially a sharp burst, had morphed into a dull ache, a weariness that settled deep in my bones.

I should say something. Apologize for slamming the door and for the way I’ve been handling everything. He was trying his best to help me, I could see that.

I got up, walked over to the window, and peered through the gap in the curtains. The parking lot was empty save for our car, a dark silhouette under the pale glow of a flickering streetlight.

He was asleep. Or pretending to be. I couldn’t tell. Either way, the sight of him lying there on the hard floor, wrapped in that thin blanket, tugged at something inside me.

 He is the only person I have left to help me.

I turned away from the window, crossed to the bathroom, and ran the tap until the water ran hot. Steam began to fill the small pink tiled room, softening the harsh fluorescent light. 

I stripped off my clothes, stepped into the shower, and closed my eyes. The hot water beat down on my skin, loosening knots in my shoulders, but it couldn’t reach the knot in my chest. The image of his face, the flash of anger he quickly suppressed, kept replaying in my mind.

When I finally turned off the water, the steam had cleared, leaving a film of condensation on the mirror. I wiped it away, revealing my reflection. Hollow-eyed and pale. A stranger stared back at me, a woman I barely recognized.

I wrapped myself in a towel and stepped back into the room. Ewing hadn't moved. He was still lying on the floor, his face turned towards the wall.

I walked over to the bed, picked up the scratchy blanket he’d left there, and knelt beside him. He didn’t stir. Gently, I draped the blanket over him, tucking it in around his shoulders.

As I stood up, my foot brushed against something on the floor. A small, worn leather wallet. 

A dark tendril of curiosity coiled in my stomach. I knew I shouldn't. I knew it was wrong. But the need to know, just to make sure, was overwhelming.

I glanced at him again. Still asleep. Or pretending.

With trembling hands, I picked up the wallet and opened it.

Inside, I found his police badge. Nestled among that were faded bills, a couple of expired credit cards, and a photograph. It was old, the edges softened and frayed, the colors muted with age.

A young girl stared back at me. Her hair was long and dark, cascading down her shoulders. She was smiling, a wide, genuine smile that lit up her entire face. And even in the grainy photograph, I could see the resemblance. The same high cheekbones, the same curve of the chin, the same spark in her eyes.

She resembled Carrie…and that young girl I found in the bunker.

My breath hitched in my throat. My heart pounded against my ribs like a trapped bird. I stared at the photograph, my mind reeling. What was this doing in Ewing's wallet? How did he know Carrie?

A wave of nausea washed over me. The room seemed to tilt, the walls closing in. I fumbled with the photograph, my fingers clumsy and numb. It slipped from my grasp and fluttered to the floor. I hit my head on the bedframe trying to catch it.

The sudden, sharp sound seemed to amplify in the small room. Ewing stirred.

He rolled over, blinking sleep from his eyes. He saw me kneeling there, the wallet open in my hand, the photograph on the floor.

His expression changed. The calm, bored facade crumbled, replaced by something raw and unguarded. Fear. Panic. A desperate plea.

""Don't,"" he said, his voice hoarse, barely a whisper. He reached out a hand to stop me.

""Who is she?"" I asked, my voice trembling. ""How do you know her?""

He didn't answer. He just stared at the photograph, his eyes filled with a mixture of grief and hopelessness.

I picked up the photograph, my fingers tracing the outline of her face. ""Tell me,"" I demanded, my voice gaining strength. ""Tell me everything.""

The silence stretched between us, heavy and suffocating. Finally, he spoke, his voice low and broken.

""It's...complicated,"" he said.

""Complicated?"" I repeated, incredulity lacing my voice. ""I was badly injured, kidnapped, forced to see things you could never imagine, and then I found out my parents were murdered. My life has fallen apart. And you tell me it's 'complicated'?""

He looked away, his gaze fixed on the floor. He took a deep breath, as if steeling himself for what he was about to say.

""Her name was Caroline,"" he began, his voice barely audible. ""Caroline Walker. She was... she was my sister.""

“You’re what?”

“My sister,” Ewing said.

I stared at him. 

“She was my sister.” He didn’t look at me. His eyes were on the wall, unfocused.

“My dad was a drunk. Violent. Mean in a way that stuck to everything, even after he was gone. My mom… she was already in her 40s when she got pregnant. Caroline was her miracle. That’s what she called her.”

He laughed, but there was no humor in it.

“She died giving birth to her. And that left me and Caroline with him.”

He rubbed the side of his neck like something itched under his skin. “He never looked at her the way a father should. Just blamed her. Called her a curse. Eventually, he drank himself to death. I was barely holding it together. Nineteen, no job, no support. I couldn’t raise a kid.”

I felt something twist in my stomach.

“So I gave her up,” he said. “To the state. To strangers. I thought I’d get back on my feet and then get her back. But I waited too long, and she went missing. Her foster family said she ran away.”

He finally looked at me. His eyes were glassy and filled with rose colored tears.

“I never believed that. Not for a second.”

I didn’t speak. The weight of it all rested on my lips - glue to hold back an “I’m sorry” that would have never released death's grief off of him

“That’s why I became a cop. I thought... if I were one of them, maybe I could find her. Maybe someone would finally listen.”

He exhaled slowly. “When you told us about Carrie, I had a feeling.”

I knelt beside him, laid a hand on his arm. He didn’t flinch.

“When I saw Jessa…I knew.” he said. “She’s got Caroline’s eyes and petite frame. Her perfect smile…”

His mouth twitched into a grin, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Caroline was small. Delicate. Quiet. She never cried…her fingers barely fit around mine.”

My throat tightened.

“She wasn’t like other children, she was too soft for the world.”

“She was the reason I got away,” I said softly.

He nodded. 

“Of course she was. She always put others before herself.”

He looked down at his hands. “I should’ve gone back for her sooner. I used to tell myself she’d wait for me. That she knew I’d come.”

He was silent for a beat, then added, quietly, “She’s supposed to be with me .”

“She looked so young,” I whispered. “I thought she was barely fourteen. How old was she when she went missing?”

“She always looked younger than she was,” he said. “She was twelve when she “ran away.”

He pressed the heel of his hand to his eye.

“She was so close this whole time.”

“You didn’t know,” I said. “You couldn’t have.”

We sat in silence for a while after that. 

Eventually, I said, “We should do a DNA test. On Jessa.”

Ewing blinked, slowly. “To see if she’s Caroline’s.”

I nodded. “If she is... then we know for sure. And we’d have proof.”

He looked down at his hands again, flexing them slightly.

“I’ll call the department back in Alaska. I’ll tell them to run a test. Quietly.”

“I think we should test Milo too,” I added. “If he’s related to Rivas’ wife, like I think... then her cousin is Cricket. Sam didn’t just take us at random. He knew about us. He picked us.”

Ewing's jaw clenched. “It would mean he’s close to all of this. To the station. Or someone who works there.”

That hung in the air for a long second.

“I found pictures in the bunker of Sam working on my house the day I moved there. We should call the company that put my house up. Ask for a list of the workers who were there that day.”

Ewing nodded slowly. “We will get the names and I’ll compare them to the ones Rivas and I know. If Sam used a fake name, maybe it’ll still stand out somehow. Someone has to remember him.”

“And if he didn’t use a fake name?” I asked.

Ewing didn’t answer for a moment.

“Then he’s been walking around in plain sight this whole time,” he said. “And someone’s been helping him.”

At that, we agreed to try and get some rest. We knew tomorrow was going to be a hard day. 



I woke up to a hand on my shoulder.

“Hey. Time to get up.”

I flinched so hard I nearly fell off the bed. The room swam in a fog of sleep and panic, and for a split second, it wasn’t Ewing’s face staring down at me. It was Sam. Masked and wide-eyed. 

But as my vision cleared, the illusion unraveled. Just Ewing, crouched beside the bed. Same calm face. Same tired eyes. He backed up a step, hands raised in apology.

“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”

My throat was dry. I blinked hard and nodded, forcing the blanket tighter around myself like it could stop my skin from shaking.

“It’s okay,” I lied.

“You’ve got ten minutes before I leave you behind,” he said, lightening the mood. “Come on. There’s free breakfast downstairs, and then we’ve got a long day ahead.”

I pulled myself out of bed slowly. Everything ached. Even after sleep, my body felt heavy, like I hadn’t truly rested.

He turned his back and gave me space, and I changed quickly. 

By the time we made it down to the lobby, the waffle station had a line. I picked at a banana and a stale muffin. Ewing drank hotel coffee like it didn’t taste like burnt chemicals.

“We’ll split up once we get to the station,” he said. “I’m going to be on the phone most of the morning with Alaska, getting the DNA process started. Jessa first, then Milo.”

I nodded. “And me?”

“The team working on your parents' case is waiting to walk you through their case file. Bring you up to speed.”

I stared down at my apple juice. My reflection in the golden surface was a blur.

“Okay,” I said. “Let’s find out what else they missed.”

There was a buzz in the air at the office today. An infuriating contradiction to the state of it last night. The phones are ringing, doors opening and shutting, and voices low but quick. Routine chaos. Ewing walked me in, nodded to a few people, then broke off with a promise: *“I’ll grab you when I’ve got news.”*

I didn’t realize how tightly I was clenching my fists until I sat down in the small conference room and had to pry my fingers open.

Two detectives came in. One was the man who was reading “Nancy Drew” last night, and the other was the woman who had serious bags under her eyes. The man introduced himself as Detective Monroe. 

“We’ll walk you through everything we know so far,” Monroe said, sliding a thick folder across the table toward me. “Fair warning: it isn’t much.”

He opened the file. The first page was a photo of the house. My parents’ porch light still on. Newspapers piled in the driveway. 

“No signs of forced entry,” Silva said. “The door was locked when the neighbors called in the welfare check. Nothing stolen. Nothing broken. Not even a footprint in the yard.”

“They were found in the living room,” Monroe added. “Both deceased. Trauma wounds both to the head and massive blood loss, and  they’d been… posed.”

I flinched.

“Do you have crime scene photos?” I asked, half hoping they’d say no.

“We do,” Silva said gently. “But you don’t need to see them unless you want to.”

I hesitated. “I do.”

She paused, then pulled out a few more pages. Glossy prints. My mother was by the coffee table, upright, hands folded in her lap. My father was on the floor nearby, like he’d collapsed trying to get to her.

“It looked staged,” Monroe said. “Like a statement.”

I kept staring at the photo of my mother. Her face looked peaceful.

“You said no fingerprints?”

“None. No prints. No hair. No fibers. No DNA.”

“That’s not possible.”

Silva nodded. “We thought the same. We believe the entire house was cleaned top to bottom. Professional job.”

My voice was quiet when I asked, “Was the food in the fridge tested?”

They exchanged a glance.

“Yes,” Monroe said. “All normal. Nothing suspicious. No signs of drugs.”

“Is there any reason Sam would’ve gone after them? He traveled all the way to Kentucky from Alaska to kill them? I don’t see how they were a threat to him.” Monroe asked. “Could it be anyone they knew? Any reason someone would want to hurt them?”

“No,” I said. “Sam is responsible for this, I know he is.”

They both sat forward a little.

“I want the name of every person who worked on my house in Alaska,” I said. “Every contractor. Every delivery driver. If we can find his last name, we can ask the airport for flight logs to see when he flew here.”

Silva nodded. “We’ll get the list. Might take a day or two, but we’ll dig.”

There was a knock on the door. Ewing leaned in.

“They’re starting the DNA testing. We’ll know more in a couple of days.”

His eyes found mine and held them.

“I think we’re getting closer,” he said.

But all I could think was how far away everything still felt.

Kingrinder p2 = $29\~  
Timemore C3 = $42\~

I noticed something weird about myself and people around me. We complain about everything. Traffic, slow wifi, our coffee being too cold. Meanwhile we live better than 99% of humans who ever existed.

So I'm building something I'm calling **""perspective therapy.""** An app that deliberately puts you through simulated hardship to reset your gratitude levels.

**Here's how it works:** You choose a ""reality check"" session. Maybe it's experiencing homelessness for 10 minutes through audio immersion. Or hearing what it's like to lose everything in a war. The app locks you in - you can't escape until the session ends.

When you come out, your actual problems feel smaller. Your life feels like a gift instead of a burden.

**The tagline I'm testing:** ""Your life isn't hard. Let us show you what is.""

I know this sounds crazy. But think about it - every wellness app tries to add calm to your chaos. What if the problem isn't that we need more peace, but that we've forgotten how good we actually have it?

**The features I'm considering:**
- Immersive audio experiences of real hardship
- ""Reality slap"" notifications when you're complaining about first world problems  
- Gratitude scoring based on contrast therapy
- AI-generated scenarios that put your problems in perspective

I'm calling it counter-therapy. Instead of avoiding discomfort, you lean into it temporarily to appreciate your real life more.

**Before I build this, I need to know:** Am I completely insane, or is there something here? Would you try an app that deliberately made you uncomfortable to help you appreciate what you have?

1l3r1rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1l3r1rg/should_i_build_the_opposite_of_calm_and_headspace/,Should I build the opposite of Calm and Headspace - an app that makes you feel worse on purpose,"Hear me out before you think I've lost my mind.

I noticed something weird about myself and people around me. We complain about everything. Traffic, slow wifi, our coffee being too cold. Meanwhile we live better than 99% of humans who ever existed.

So I'm building something I'm calling **""perspective therapy.""** An app that deliberately puts you through simulated hardship to reset your gratitude levels.

**Here's how it works:** You choose a ""reality check"" session. Maybe it's experiencing homelessness for 10 minutes through audio immersion. Or hearing what it's like to lose everything in a war. The app locks you in - you can't escape until the session ends.

When you come out, your actual problems feel smaller. Your life feels like a gift instead of a burden.

**The tagline I'm testing:** ""Your life isn't hard. Let us show you what is.""

I know this sounds crazy. But think about it - every wellness app tries to add calm to your chaos. What if the problem isn't that we need more peace, but that we've forgotten how good we actually have it?

**The features I'm considering:**
- Immersive audio experiences of real hardship
- ""Reality slap"" notifications when you're complaining about first world problems  
- Gratitude scoring based on contrast therapy
- AI-generated scenarios that put your problems in perspective

I'm calling it counter-therapy. Instead of avoiding discomfort, you lean into it temporarily to appreciate your real life more.

**Before I build this, I need to know:** Am I completely insane, or is there something here? Would you try an app that deliberately made you uncomfortable to help you appreciate what you have?

1l3r1l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1l3r1l7/scèntual_fragrances_perfume_oil_review_dupes/,Scèntual Fragrances - perfume oil review (dupes),"Hi, all:

Heard about Scèntual Fragrances and decided to try some + write a brief review.

**About them:** US-based fragrance company that makes dupes of popular fragrances. They offer scents as fragrance mists, roll-on fragrance oils and body and hair oils. Their Bianco Latte dupe was trending for awhile on social media. They state on their website that their fragrances are vegan and cruelty free.

**Why I am writing this:** They have dupes of some of my favorite fragrances and wanted to see how these dupes measured up. Every single thing I have heard about these dupes has been hype, and they have 100% five-star reviews on their website. They claim their fragrances are ""beast mode"" with all day longevity. I am always skeptical when I see products with that level of performance and that many five star reviews. Really, not one four star review or below?

**Why I bought fragrance oils:** They were cheap (approx $10 each) and I can layer them under my non-duped fragrances if I wanted.

**What I bought:** dupes of Bianco Latte, Escape Gourmande, Delina, Burberry Goddess and a coffee fragrance ""inspired by Parisian Cafes"". Not sure exactly what fragrance that might be, if any.

**Scents I owned already:** Bianco Latte (decant), Eclaire, Escape Gourmande (decant), Burberry Goddess, Angham, other coffee fragrances (Coffee Addict, French Coffee).

**Individual reviews:**

Caramel Vanilla (Bianco Latte dupe): Closer to Bianco Latte than any other dupe I have tried, including Eclaire. All of the dupes I have tried are missing that lactonic note that Bianco Latte has, and this one is no exception. Less projection than Eclaire. No plastic or vanilla candle notes for me. 4-6 hour performance on my skin.

Creme Brulee (Escape Gourmande dupe): this is a 1:1 dupe. Similar projection to Caramel Vanilla. 4-6 hour performance on my skin.

Vanilla Latte: Extremely artificial French vanilla scent on the opening. Scent was overwhelming/nauseating when I applied anything more than a small dab on my wrist (rolling the scent on my wrist was overkill). This scent smells much better with conservative use and on drydown, where the coffee notes start to show up. Second strongest scent projection out of the scents I tried. This one did last all day on my skin.

Lavender Vanilla (Burberry Goddess dupe): This one had the weakest performance out of all of the dupes I tried. I put a tiny dab on my skin around 20 minutes ago and the scent is already gone. It is closer to Goddess than Angham, with far less vanilla in the dry down. This scent is 90% the opening of Goddess with 10% of the drydown. The quality of the vanilla in the drydown is nowhere near as good as Angham or Goddess. Not a bad scent and still might be worth it for the price, even considering performance issues--this is one you can apply fairly liberally.

Queen of Roses (Delina dupe): Full disclosure, I spent a lot of time reading Delina reviews but have not smelled it myself. This one projects LOUD and it lasts forever--no joke, I applied it on the back of my neck three days ago and I can still smell it. My partner says ""it smells like you are carrying around a $600 bouquet of flowers all day"" and it does feel that way due to the profound scent trail. It is a jammy rose where lychee and rhubarb dominate in the opening, and becomes rose forward after that. I don't detect any of the other notes listed at any point. Incredible performance with this one.

**Negatives:** The bottles are glass. I have dropped other perfume bottles before (mostly the small travel size ones) with no issues, although it's only happened twice; one of my bottles fell and shattered open on my tile floor. I like the fact that the bottles are glass, but am now paranoid that I am going to drop them again. My bathroom still smells like Bianco Latte.

**General advice:** Less is more here--don't overapply, you will regret it.

**Do I recommend them?** Absolutely for the price point, I am still suspicious of the lack of negative reviews though. Shipping was prompt; no issues there.

Hope this helps someone!",2,1749100431.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

I started this barista position last fall 2024 and I’m a new adult so I take public transportation and a broke college student. This person who I’ll address as Bay. We are 3 years apart and they are a manager at the cafe and they live in the city which is one hour away from the cafe. (The commute is crazy) but they had recently moved to the city and they were supposed to transfer cafes at the meantime they would work out here. So I had started new and I would close a lot. Bay had been nice enough to give me rides after work despite their hour ride back to their home. Those car rides became meaningful as I started opening up about myself to them. And my older sister who I’m not really close to also works at that cafe (keep this character in mind) she had also given me rides when we did work the same shifts and I would tell her about issues I’m dealing with but would be told to “ignore it” or “to not think like that” (like bro no shit) but I would tell bay about these irritable responses. Bay would always comfort me and I felt understood for once in my life as they are literally the first soul I told anything to. It went on like that for a while and they started asking for my socials and picking me up to TAKE me to work when we had the same shifts. They even invited me to a new years celebration!! Like the first hang out I’ve ever had that is not family bro. And I stayed the night too. And we started hanging out from there. My sister didn’t get the genuine connection we had and would tell me there is no one who is genuine and that “I don’t know they intentions” like I get her concern but she didn’t need to insult me for finding someone I connect with because I wasn’t as close with her. Like tell me who in the world who isn't genuine would let you stay at their own apartment despite the late night, pay for your food, invite you to celebration and birthdays and movies, even pay for the movies and listen to your trauma or buy you coffee or let you wear their clothes when you don't have clean ones or cook for you one morning or invite you to their childhood home or have dinner with their mother or even start planing your birthday months away from it and even saying they want to be roommates with you and take you to your house late night closing shifts and invite you to a colorado trip and spend a day with you on that trip while they visit a friend or even sacrifice their own stomach when they eat your cheesecake that they knowingly are aware that they are lactose intolerant (I didn’t know at the time) but sacrifice a trip to the bathroom to make you feel proud of your baking or add you on socials and checking up on you. To even having me over when they are dog sitting and saving me from your OWN SISTERS OUTBUSTS THAT CAUSES YOU EMOTIONAL PAIN AND DROVE ACROSS TOWN TO PICK YOU UP WHILE THEY WERE TIRED AND DIRTY. Or that they held you close when yo, had an argument with family!? I love them so much it almost hurts because I want to show so much affection but I fear it might be a good friendship to them but I really love them. Bay isn’t the kind (from what they said) to do this for anyone but I don’t want to overthink it. Also they drove me to their childhood house when I was drunk one time because they knew that dropping me off at my apartment was a no-go (my parent stays with me)They also decided to move back out here instead of moving to the city because they “didn’t think [they’d] get attached” and told me they want to move in together as their lease ends in August but mine ends in November but they tell me they are willing to wait and live with their cousin in the meantime. >///<",1,1749100247.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

**My \[35F\] husband \[36M\] is burned out and can't work in his normally high-paying field. I'm resenting having to go back to work to support us. Help!**



This is part genuine request for perspective/opinions and part getting it off my chest.

To sum up, my husband and I have been married 10 years. We have a good marriage and have never faced any truly difficult times. It’ll be difficult to explain everything that goes into this, but I’m happy to expound in the comments.

Basically, the last decade has largely been focused on achieving financial independence. I had never been a very business-oriented person until I met my husband. He is extremely entrepreneurial and his passion for it is catching. We have run our own businesses together and separately throughout our marriage. The goal has always been to make enough money on location-independent businesses we can live freely. Not necessarily retire, but be have more freedom. Because of his encouragement, I am now on a career path that could easily result in that.

In 10 years, we have moved 25 times, all because better opportunities have presented themselves or current opportunities have dried up. We’re now facing #26 with #27 not far away because #26 doesn’t look like that good of a prospect.

Without giving away details, my business fluctuates greatly. I’ve had months where I pull in mid-5 figures and long stretches of a few hundred. My “career” outside of this is food service with a very definite wage ceiling. My husband’s “career” is professional and he can easily find a 6-figure salary position. His current online business currently brings in low 4-figures. We have always relied on his going back to work when money runs low. He's in high demand, can practically snap his fingers and get a job. I... cannot.

Here’s the conflict (and where I’ll try to eliminate as much of my bias as possible). My husband is completely burned-out. He physically and emotionally can’t deal with the stress of going to work right now. He has supported me through the last couple years when my income has been low. I’ve always been aware of my financial contribution and make up for it by carrying the grand majority of the household chores. Even when I was working 60+ hours as a manager (and pulling in half his wage). But as our savings are dwindling, it’s looking more and more like I’ll have to get a job. That means pushing my business to the backburner, working a physically demanding job, all for a quarter of the pay he could get.

I’m not one to spend money. We didn’t have a wedding. We bought my wedding band three years after we got married. I cut my own hair. I work from home in sweatpants. It’s not as though I’ve forced him to work jobs he hates in order to provide me with an extravagant lifestyle. I have worked shit jobs to help provide for us in the past and even when my business isn’t earning a ton, I still put in 50+ hours a week.

I’m craving stability. Not permanence, just the feeling that I can unpack our boxes and not feel like I should save them in a closet knowing in 6-9 months I’ll need them again. We’ve been child-free for years, but the last couple years the topic has been coming up more and more. Yet I feel it’s impossible to even discuss the idea of starting a family in the face of such uncertainty. I miss my cats (they’re living with my parents overseas). I want a fish tank and a place to hang pictures.

He says, “If you want those things, then make them happen.” Which, fair enough. I completely agree with. I don’t want to rely on him to provide the life I want, however it leaves me feeling a combination of emotions I can’t really put a word to. I find myself going through mental exercises of, “What would I do in this situation if I were single? How would I support myself?” and I start to feel resentful. I’m NOT single. I’m married. And not only that, I'm not sure I CAN make enough money to support us.

I desperately want him to find what it is he’s meant to do. I don’t care about the money or the dreams of financial independence if it means he’s miserable trying to get there. He’s been trying to work out which direction to change to for the past year and has yet to come up with anything solid. I know it’s all about give and take, but I can’t help but feel… I don’t know. I don’t have the words. And I’m at a complete loss as to how we resolve this.

(BTW, we have talked about all of this about 1,957 times already. There is nothing written here he hasn’t heard before.)

TL;DR – Husband has always been the primary earner with well-paying jobs, but has experienced serious burn-out. As we’re eating into our savings, it looks like I’ll have to put my business on hold and go back to work. Our discussions about steps forward have left me feeling resentful about our roles in the relationship. Am I being a spoiled brat about it all?

EDIT: I appreciate all the comments and opinions. This got a lot more response than I expected. Just a few things. It's difficult to sum up an entire life in a few hundred words.

* The moves have been for varied and obviously with 25 of them, multiple reasons. Some were because my husband was offered a good job. Others were to be nearer family.
* I've been pursing my side business for the last 3.5 years. The 7 prior to that I was in full time employment, sometimes working a full time job while also helping to run our own business. He has not financially supported me for 10 years.
* I'm not sure where people got MLM from, but I'm in a creative field. As I said, I don't want to reveal details, but I create products and then sell them online. We are not scam artists nor do we have to leave town because people are catching on to our pyramid scheme, lol...
* As far as financials go, again, it's impossible to sum up 10 years of income. But we go through feast and famine periods... times when money is flowing in and times when we live off what we've earned. We never live outside our means and when money is good, we put thousands a month away to prepare for the down times. It's not a typical way of living so I understand it's not easily relatable.

**Comments**

**WafflingToast**

*So...you both have entrepreneurial side businesses and full time jobs? Plus moving every 3-6 months for the last ten years?*

*That would burn anybody out. I know financial independence is a dream...but it seems like if both put down roots (maybe for a specified time, like 4 years) and found stability, burn out wouldn't be a factor. Financially and emotionally, starting over takes a toll.*

*I want to say make a plan, but sometimes you have to go with the flow, work a job and just make it day to day without trying to achieve large crushing goals of making it big with an entrepreneurial venture.*

>OOP: We go back and forth when it comes to the full-time employment. Because of his high salary and short life-span when working, it's been more like 6 months on, several months off... but there is always a side business. Always, lol.

**bnenene**

*If you're trying to reach financial independence based on location-independent businesses, why on earth do you have to move 25 times in 10 years? Why on earth are you moving for #26 if you think you'll have to move again for #27?*

*It sounds to me like there is something wrong with how your husband is pursuing financial independence, and I'm worried that your husband is not so much ""entrepreneurial"" as chasing money schemes up hill and down dale. After 10 years of working on it, how close are you to your net worth goal? You sound very frugal. Surely after ten years you have a solid nest egg, and are seeing that net worth start to grow through compound interest? Why do you say your savings are dwindling when his business brings in enough money to pay the bills? From a FI/RE perspective, this just doesn't add up.*

*Even if this strategy really is working in a money sense, if you are sick of moving and long for stability, the strategy is not working for you or or your marriage. I think your reaction to the current circumstances is about a bigger set of issues than just going back to work. You sound like you're at the end of your rope with a lot of things (moving, housework, children), and going back to low ROI work is the last straw.*

*As others have said, your husband needs to treat his burnout. You sound burned out too. You both need to take a step back and look at your plans and lifestyle, through marriage counselling, financial advice, whatever will help you review with clear eyes and get on the same page. Your current plans and lifestyle are clearly not working for either of you.*

**Gibonius**

*You'd think that moving every five months might be a sign that they're not doing a very good job of identifying opportunities and need to reevaluate their strategy. What's happening that opportunities fade out in less than half a year, or that there's always a new/better option to jump to almost immediately but they don't seem to be moving forward?*

*That kind of lifestyle is exhausting, even if it's working. It really seems like they need to sit down and have a total rethink about their strategic outlook.*

>OOP: When I say savings are dwindling... there is a lump of money in the savings account that we never, ever touch and treat as the rock bottom. We never get close to that amount, so in my mind, what we have to live off in ""savings"" is running out. When we budget, we don't feel like we're doing well unless we're able to put money away at the end of the month.

>After 10 years of working we are definitely not where either of us would like to be. That's not to say the experiences and ups and downs weren't worth it. I honestly don't think it's in my husband to buckle down with a 9-5 job and squirrel away money for retirement. I have always been happy to help him pursue his goals of owning/running his own businesses because I have faith in him.

>It's clear after talking through this on here, we're at a fork in the road.

**Update - 10 months later**

**For years, my \[35F\] husband \[37M\] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help? Relationships**

I'm writing partly to sort all this out in my head and partly for outside perspectives - I don't even know what to think anymore. Again, I'm happy to explain any details that need fleshing out if it helps. I'll try to be concise and I truly appreciate you reading.

9 months ago, I posted asking for help about my frustration with going back to work after my husband burned-out in his career (previous post in my history). For the sake of anonymity, I tried to be vague with the details and many thought our work was on the dodgy side. I don't care about keeping it anonymous... all these factors are relevant. I'm an author - I self-published books and made a decent living doing it for several years. My husband is a software developer and mainly buys existing online companies, and fixes them up to sell. When that's not working, he tries to work a 'normal' 9-5, but typically lasts no more than 6 months. His last attempt was 1 day. My career before this was in the food industry, which means crap pay, long hours and very sore feet.

I got a job that pays 95% of the bills (the rest is covered by savings). Yeah, I'd rather be working for myself, but I like it. I'm good at it. It's the first time I actually enjoy going to work. For the last few months, I've been slowly changing and it feels like my husband and I are drifting apart. At first I thought it was a natural phase, things will definitely feel different compared to working under the same roof all day and night. Now... I don't know. From the previous thread:

He says, “If you want those things, then make them happen.” Which, fair enough. I completely agree with. I don’t want to rely on him to provide the life I want, however it leaves me feeling a combination of emotions I can’t really put a word to. I find myself going through mental exercises of, “What would I do in this situation if I were single? How would I support myself?” and I start to feel resentful. I’m NOT single. I’m married. And not only that, I'm not sure I CAN make enough money to support us.

I AM making enough money to support us and if feels good. It's given me confidence in a way I haven't had before. But, it's also made something glaringly obvious in our relationship... we disagree on just about everything AND we have very little in common.

I'm happy to work on my writing on the side while I work. He thinks I've given up on our dream and have settle for a world (the 9-5, M-F world) he is loathe to spend time in. He sold his business and is still figuring out what he wants to do next. I want to buy a flat in the city. He wants to move to the country, or use our savings to travel or live remotely. I want to settle for a while and make friends. He thinks there's plenty of time for that in the future. I want to make our home cosy and put up decorations like photos and artwork. While he likes it, he thinks of it all as just pointless stuff we shouldn't waste money on. I could go on, but you get it. It feels like literally everything I like, he hates.

I've also realized that most of the moves, most of the big big decisions were things I went along with. I'm not saying he bullied me or anything, just that I didn't feel too strongly one way or the other, so tended to go with what he wanted. Of course we talked about it, but it rarely was me pulling in the bulk of the income so I didn't feel like I had much of a say. Now I feel strongly about a life direction and have the ability to make it happen, and I feel... guilty? He says I've changed, that he's the same as he's been, wants the same things he's always wanted. This is me altering the situation, which I agree with. But it's not like it's this massive bait and switch plan. Our entire marriage I've talked about settling down... I'm rambling.

Here's the way I see it. We both love each other and genuinely want to make the other happy, which is why over 10 years, we've both compromised on choices that go against what we individually want. He goes to work for a little while so I can have a semi-stable home. I bounce around the world with him so he can discover himself and his career. But our tolerance for these periods have become too short to manage. He physically can't work for another person. I want to scream when I think about packing up my stuff and starting over again. Have we just spent so much of our marriage being distracted by the exciting newness of moving and pushing for financial independence, we didn't notice how little we have in common otherwise? I can't help but feel like this is on me - not my fault, per se, but on my shoulders. I'm the one rocking the status quo and if I want things to balance out, it's up to me to adjust my expectations.

TL;DR – Things in my marriage have shifted drastically since I started working again. For years, my husband said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever.

**\[deleted\]**

*I remember reading your original post and I'm happy that you've been able to find some financial stability for yourself. Your husband can work for other people, he didn't lose his limbs in the war, he just doesn't want too. That's a very important distinction for the next point I'll be making. Your husband is content to constantly move around, live off of savings and never settle in one place. While neither of you are old, you are getting to an age where settling down and having friends and roots is important because as you age those things will get harder to do. I'm not saying people don't make friends in the latter part of their life but rather that most people have established friend groups at your age.*

*So, my husband and I also work in the service industry. We make a living wage but definitely nothing to write home about. Both of us would like to start our own business but while we work on that and likely for the foreseeable future, we will work these jobs. Even when our business is running, we will need to continue to serve because most small businesses are simply not sustainable at first. Even in the long run we will most likely not profit enough to solely to be self employed. That is a hard fact but it is the truth and one that we can live with. Neither of us want to be servers, its not our dream but making money is a necessity. My point to all of this being that plenty of people work jobs that they do not enjoy and would rather not but that doesn't mitigate the reality that money must be made and must continuously flow into the home by any means necessary.*

*I think you should take a good , hard look at your marriage. It seems that the two of you are deeply incompatible and would both be happier with a partner who had the same life goals. If anyone has been bait and switched, its you by your husband who enabled you to believe that settling down was the ultimate goal of all the moves and schemes. I hope you find the answer that you're looking for and wish you a lot of happiness with whatever you choose.*

>OOP: Before I get lost in my own selfish thoughts, I want to wish you luck with your businesses! It's not easy, and I have loads of love for people who hustle for their passion :)

>The friends and roots things is a real sore point for me. Our whole marriage we've been firmly childfree. The last two years, we had a last blast of 'are we actually sure we're sure' which threw up a lot of discussions about the future and what we envision. We're sure. No kids. But that means if I want a network of people near and around me, I have to work to make that happen. I have no family and his family is ambivalent about seeing each other. All my friends have become acquaintances because of the moving. I see this lonely life ahead of me with no one in it and that scares me.

>I just wish, and I know how ludicrous it sounds as I write it, but I just wish the normal life he could build with me would be enough for him. We could have an amazing, stable life full of traveling and friends and everything people dream of. But he sees getting a job as trading his life - his time - for money... and that's not a deal he wants to make.

>Thank you for your reply and I really do wish you luck.

**travelbug898**

*You guys sound super incompatible. Is this really the man who you imagine building the life you want with?*

*If you want a chance to keep this marriage afloat, I'd seriously consider couples counseling to see if you can find compromises here that both of you can agree to. If you can't find those compromises, then you should seriously consider moving on.*

>OOP: I mean, yeah I want to continue my life with him. I love him, I like him. We do enjoy each other's company. I really think these problems are probably for a professional.

**Update - 7 years later**

I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and found this old throwaway, and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I ""realized my mistake."" When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself.

TL;DR: Left my husband, happier than ever.

1l3qukn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1l3qukn/noob_endurance_cyclist_1_month_in_sharing/,"Noob endurance cyclist – 1 month in, sharing progress + questions","I got my first bike—a Cannondale Topstone 4 gravel bike—about a month ago with two goals: short-term, to ride the STP next month (206 miles total over two days); and long-term, to go on bike tours. I’ve been building up my rides quickly, keeping them mostly in zones 2 and somewhat 3.

So far, my PRs have gone from 15mi > 33mi > 50mi > 70mi, averaging 12–13 mph. I mix in plenty of shorter rides between my long ones and ride 3–5 times a week.

  
I’d read plenty about how crucial nutrition and hydration are, but I just shrugged it off, thinking, “If I run out of energy, I’ll eat or drink then.” It turns out I learned that the hard way because fueling is definitely its own skill.

**15 miles**: Just sore from the saddle. Felt great after.

**33 miles**: I hit my first bonk. I ate absolutely nothing that day, but did stop to drink a coffee with some sugar halfway through. Right around the 30 mile mark my legs started to hurt a bit and I could feel the strength leave them almost instantly. I was very shaky in the car and very sore and fatigued the next day. I chalked it up to hitting my fitness or muscle endurance threshold, but after doing some research, I found that there’s more to bonking than just feeling tired—so I decided to start eating 50–60g of carbs every 45 minutes moving forward. Fig Newtons, Haribo, bananas and Clif bars. Problem solved?

  
**50 miles**: I ate and drank water consistently. No bonking, but my ass soreness seemed to be my biggest barrier. Overall I felt decent the next day, just a little sore. Night and day difference from the 33 mile ride, anyway.

  
**70 miles**: I ate and drank water consistently, but around mile 44, I hit a wall. I felt drained, lost strength, my ass hurt more than ever, and my mental state took a dive. I started getting heart palpitations and felt lightheaded. I was confused — I thought I was well-prepared and locked in. Maybe it was a little hotter this time? Maybe I had sweat more this time? Maybe I didn't pace myself enough early on? I wanted to push for a PR, but it was starting to feel potentially dangerous, as dramatic as that may sound. 

I stopped at a gas station and did some quick research. Turns out water alone isn’t enough, and Gatorade (electrolytes) alone doesn’t cut it either, you have to do both. In hindsight, it seems like common sense, but I didn't account for it. I grabbed a bag of Fritos, a can of bean dip, a sugar soda (I usually drink diet), and Gatorade. Twenty minutes later, I caught a huge second wind and powered through another 20 miles like it was the start of the ride. I felt amazing. By the time I hit 70 miles, I honestly felt like I could’ve kept going.

  
**Questions:**

1. Could poor fueling actually worsen saddle soreness? It might sound strange, but I’ve noticed that whenever I fuel properly, the pain eases—and when I don’t, it tends to get worse. Is there any truth to this, even anecdotal? It seems crazy that my ass can be so sore, but some proper fueling completely resets me. I do wear a bib and upgraded to a $100 saddle right when I got the bike, FYI.
2. Towards the end of my rides, I find myself standing every 7–10 minutes to relieve saddle pain. Should I try to push through it and stay seated, or is that just part of longer rides?
3. Do breaks directly help to prevent bonking? I usually take two 10–15 min breaks. I hate stopping and prefer to keep momentum, but I wonder if I should add more as my rides get longer. I have a feeling I'm already pushing it and should start eating an actual meal in the middle of my rides.
4. Was I just lucky to recover from a bonk that quickly, or is bouncing back that fast usually doable? My top priority is making sure I don’t fail the STP!



Any tips are appreciated! I'm really enjoying this and am so glad I’ve found a new hobby that keeps me active and planning for the future.

Psychologically, I think it's all about comfort and predictability. The routine of going to the same place gives a sense of security and convenience.

1l3qo0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l3qo0f/hr_the_inherent_void/,[HR] The Inherent Void,"The biting winds of November 1991 offered no comfort, only a stark reminder of the escalating chill in global affairs. The Cold War, long a simmering cauldron of proxy conflicts and ideological warfare, was threatening to boil over. Premier Dmitri Volkov, a hardline ideologue, had taken the Soviet Union to the precipice with his unyielding rhetoric and open disdain for diplomacy. His latest move: commanding the ""Autumn Storm"" naval exercise in the Barents Sea aboard the newly refitted Kirov-class battlecruiser, Kirov (RKR-181) – a blatant display of power that felt less like a drill and more like a prelude. His pronouncements, condemning American ""interventionism,"" resonated with a chilling finality across the globe.

Deep beneath the choppy waves, the USS Toledo (SSN-769), a Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine, felt the tremors of that global tension. Her crew, a tightly knit unit of silent warriors, were among the few aware of the impossible burden placed upon them. Their mission, ""Operation Neptune's Spear,"" was a desperate, clandestine gamble to avert an unthinkable future. The directive, stark and unforgiving, was burned into Captain Aberson’s mind: covertly penetrate the Barents Sea, locate and track the Kirov (RKR-181) – Volkov's presumed command center – and destroy it via torpedo strike, thereby eliminating the Premier and disrupting Soviet hardline leadership. Deniability was paramount. Success meant the world might breathe; failure meant an abyss.

The ingress into the Barents Sea was a masterclass in silent running. There were no concealing ice caps here, only the unpredictable, churning grey of the sea state to mask their passage. Every creak of the hull, every whisper of machinery, was a potential betrayer against the background noise. The passive sonar arrays were their eyes and ears, straining against the ocean's cacophony for any sign of the Soviet hunters—surface escorts, active sonar pings, or the unsettling, familiar hum of a Kilo-class fast attack submarine. The air in the control room was thick with anticipation, the only sounds the soft hum of electronics, the occasional quiet order, and the rapid, rhythmic breathing of the sonar team, each hoping to become a ghost in the deep.

Days blurred into a perpetual twilight of silent vigilance. Then, the Barents Sea began to hum with the true symphony of ""Autumn Storm."" Sonar painted a mosaic of Soviet naval power: the massive acoustic signature of the Kirov (RKR-181) at its center, surrounded by a dense, shifting screen of cruisers, destroyers, and frigates. Tracking was agonizingly slow, a deadly game of hide-and-seek where one misstep meant oblivion. Aberson felt the weight of his crew's lives, and the fate of nations, pressing down on him. Every subtle shift in the Kirov's course, every faint contact from a distant escort, was analyzed, debated, and factored into the ever-tightening approach. There was no room for mistakes.

The moment came. The Toledo was in position, a phantom in the thermocline, a perfect firing solution locked onto the Kirov (RKR-181). Orders were given, calm and precise. The torpedo tubes flooded, the pressure building, then the silent whoosh as two MK-48 ADCAPs surged away, their wakes fading into the deep, destined for their target.

But the Barents Sea was a treacherous mistress, and fate, a cruel master. As the torpedoes sped towards their target, a sudden, piercing ping tore through the Toledo's hull – an active sonar sweep from an unexpected Kilo-class submarine, a random, lucky sweep that found them. How could things have gone wrong? Everything was perfect. Textbook infiltration and target acquisition, it’s almost as if destiny itself had other plans for Aberson… The Soviet submarine had been on a routine patrol, unaware of the American intruder's grim purpose, but its sonar had stumbled upon the Toledo at the worst possible moment. It’s active sonar giving away Toledo’s attack position, its passive sonar telling of the unmistakable sound of the Toledo’s flooding torpedo tubes. Before the Toledo's own torpedoes could reach their mark, the counter-attack was brutal, precise.

The silent, frigid embrace of the Barents Sea became a tomb. The USS Toledo, once a whisper in the deep, was suddenly a scream. It wasn't a warning on their sonar that announced the end, but the chilling acoustic signature of incoming torpedoes, then the devastating impacts. The hull tore, violent eruptions plunging the forward compartments into darkness and chaos. Alarms shrieked, drowned out by the roar of incoming water and the tearing of metal. Lights flickered, then died, plunging the crew into a desperate, futile struggle against the overwhelming pressure and the relentless, icy flood. There was no time for a final message, no chance for escape. The immense pressure of the deep finished what the Soviet torpedoes had begun, crushing the Toledo into a mangled wreck, leaving behind only a spreading slick of oil and a few rising bubbles, silent witnesses to a mission that had gone catastrophically, irrevocably wrong.

Premier Volkov, shaken but alive, watched the distant plumes of water from the Kirov (RKR-181)'s bridge. The attempted assassination, a brazen act of war, had failed. His survival, a testament to Soviet vigilance and naval superiority, would not be met with restraint. Instead, it fueled his already burning conviction that the West sought his destruction, and by extension, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The brief, terrifying glimpse of the American submarine, now a mangled wreck on the seabed, solidified his resolve.

The failure of Operation Neptune's Spear didn't just mean the loss of a submarine and its valiant crew; it meant the loss of the final, desperate gamble for peace. Volkov, emboldened and enraged, broadcast his survival to the world, denouncing the ""cowardly American aggression"" and vowing swift, decisive retaliation. The Soviet military, already on high alert, moved to full combat readiness. The fragile diplomatic threads that had barely held were severed, replaced by the deafening roar of escalating tensions. The Cold War, which had flickered with hope for a peaceful conclusion, now ignited, plunging the world into a hot, terrifying conflict, the very abyss Operation Neptune's Spear had been designed to prevent. The cost of failure was not merely measured in lives, but in the dawn of a new, darker age.
The Barents Sea, still churning from the recent violence, became the epicenter of a cataclysmic shift. 

On the bridge of the Kirov (RKR-181), Premier Volkov’s initial shock morphed into incandescent fury. Reports flooded in from the Kilo-class submarine: definitive identification of the downed vessel as a US Navy fast-attack submarine, a Los Angeles-class. The audacity of it, a direct assassination attempt on Soviet soil, during a declared exercise! The rage within the Soviet high command was palpable, a collective roar of outrage echoing through the Kirov's command center. This was no mere reconnaissance; this was war, delivered from the depths.

Volkov wasted no time. His address to the world was a firestorm, broadcast globally within hours of the Toledo's demise. His voice, usually gruff, resonated with an almost messianic zeal, hardened by what he painted as an unprovoked, barbaric act of American aggression. ""The capitalist West, desperate in its decline, has chosen the path of terrorism and assassination!"" he thundered, his face grim, eyes burning. ""They sought to decapitate the Soviet Union, to plunge our nation into chaos. But Soviet vigilance prevailed! The cowardly assassin, a snake in our waters, has been crushed!"" He then declared, with chilling certainty, that this act would not go unpunished. ""Retribution will be swift, decisive, and commensurate with the treachery committed against the Soviet people and its leadership!""

Across the vast expanse of the Soviet Union, the military machine lurched into an unprecedented state of full combat readiness. Northern Fleet surface combatants, already bristling, extended their patrols aggressively, their active sonars now sweeping the ocean with ruthless intent. Naval aviation roared to life, Tu-142 'Bear' ASW aircraft and MiG-31 'Foxhound' interceptors scrambling, pushing outwards beyond established air defense zones. On land, tank divisions across the European front began rapid deployments, their treads grinding the frozen earth as they moved towards western borders. Strategic Rocket Forces, usually shrouded in absolute secrecy, saw subtle, yet unmistakable, signs of heightened alert – a silent, chilling signal to the West that their arsenal was not just a deterrent, but a very real threat.

The world watched, horrified. Diplomatic channels, already strained, imploded. Ambassadors were recalled, embassies shuttered. Emergency sessions of the UN Security Council devolved into shouting matches, accusations flying back and forth, each side clinging to its narrative, drowning out any faint pleas for de-escalation. The carefully constructed web of treaties and agreements, the fragile architecture of deterrence that had defined the Cold War for decades, disintegrated in a matter of hours. The line had been crossed.

The sun rose on a new, terrifying reality. The Cold War was no longer cold; it was a global conflagration waiting to ignite, each side poised, trembling on the brink. The calculated risk of ""Operation Neptune's Spear"" had not averted disaster, but accelerated it, pulling the world into the abyss it had desperately sought to avoid. Fear, raw and primal, gripped populations from Washington to Moscow, as the shadow of mutual destruction loomed larger and closer than ever before. The fate of humanity, so carelessly gambled, now hung by a thread, irrevocably altered by the crushing of a single submarine in the icy, unforgiving Barents Sea.

The sun rose on a world utterly transformed. Volkov’s broadcast, raw and venomous, had ripped through the brittle veneer of peace, stripping away diplomatic niceties and exposing the bare teeth of global confrontation. News channels, once obsessed with minor political scandals, now flashed stark, terrifying headlines: ""SOVIET RETALIATION IMMINENT,"" ""WORLD ON BRINK,"" ""NATO FORCES ON MAXIMUM ALERT."" Panic rippled through cities across continents. Banks saw runs on cash, grocery store shelves emptied as desperate citizens hoarded supplies, and gas lines snaked for miles. Civil defense sirens, once relics of a bygone era, were tested with chilling regularity, their wails echoing through suburban streets, a constant reminder of the unseen sword hanging overhead.

In Washington D.C., the air was acrid with recrimination and fear. The Oval Office became a pressure cooker of frantic strategizing and desperate damage control. How had this happened? Who authorized it? The intelligence community, the Pentagon, the President himself – all faced intense scrutiny. Deniability, the cornerstone of Operation Neptune's Spear, had crumbled under the undeniable acoustic evidence of the Toledo's destruction and Volkov’s furious counter-narrative. The official White House statement, condemning the ""unprovoked sinking of a US naval vessel in international waters"" and accusing the Soviets of ""bellicose escalation,"" rang hollow against Volkov's defiant roar. The President, pale and strained, addressed the nation from a fortified bunker, promising resolve, but his voice was thin, laced with a fear that mirrored his audience's.

The ""hot"" Cold War wasn't an immediate mushroom cloud, but a terrifying, grinding escalation. Within days, the Fulda Gap in Germany became a razor's edge, Soviet and NATO tanks staring across a rapidly hardening line, their main guns locked, their crews living in a perpetual state of hyper-alertness. In the North Atlantic, naval groups engaged in aggressive, dangerous cat-and-mouse games, sonar pings filling the frigid depths with unseen threats. A Soviet Blackjack bomber, pushing aggressive boundaries, was intercepted over the Norwegian Sea by US F-15s; the resulting near-miss was just one of countless incidents, each capable of sparking full-scale conflict. The rhetoric hardened, becoming unforgiving, dehumanizing. Propaganda machines churned out images of the enemy, evil incarnate, solidifying public opinion into rigid, fearful camps.
Life changed profoundly. Ration books, dormant since the last great war, were printed. Schools drilled ""duck and cover"" procedures with somber seriousness. The promise of a peace dividend vanished, replaced by an insatiable demand for military hardware. The very air seemed to vibrate with a low hum of dread, a constant, low-frequency anxiety that seeped into every home, every conversation. The world was no longer simply divided; it was a vast, sprawling battlefield, its true casualties not yet tallied, its future shrouded in an impenetrable, chilling uncertainty. The echoes of the Toledo's final, crushing demise resonated not just through the Barents Sea, but through the very fabric of existence, a grim herald of a global conflict that had finally, irrevocably, begun.

The first shell that ripped through the cold morning air over the Fulda Gap was not an isolated incident, but the igniting spark of a global inferno. It began as a limited probing action, a border skirmish perhaps, intended to test resolve, or perhaps a panicked reaction to a perceived maneuver. But the fragile tripwire, stretched to breaking point by the sinking of the Toledo and Volkov's incendiary rhetoric, snapped. Within hours, tank fire erupted along a hundred kilometers of the inner-German border. The thunder of artillery, the roar of jet engines, and the screech of tank tracks replaced the uneasy silence, transforming the ancient German plains into a hellish crucible.
The following weeks were a blur of escalating horror. NATO and Warsaw Pact forces, coiled springs for decades, uncoiled with terrifying speed. Conventional war, on a scale unseen since 1945, engulfed Central Europe. Massive Soviet armored columns, spearheaded by T-72s and T-80s, surged westward, met by the fierce, technologically advanced defenses of American M1 Abrams and German Leopards. Air battles raged constantly above the front lines, the skies choked with the contrails of F-15s, F-16s, MiG-29s, and Su-27s, each dogfight a desperate ballet of steel and fire. Cities bordering the front, like Kassel and Magdeburg, became targets for sustained bombardment, their civilian populations caught in the grinding, indiscriminate maw of total war. Refugee crises exploded, overwhelming neighboring countries.

The conflict, however, refused to be confined to Europe. Naval engagements intensified dramatically across the globe. In the North Atlantic, carrier groups became high-stakes targets, hunted relentlessly by Soviet submarine packs, turning vast ocean stretches into zones of active combat. In the Pacific, the Bering Strait became a hot zone, with skirmishes over Arctic sovereignty and strategic transit routes. Proxy conflicts in the Middle East, already simmering, flared into direct confrontation as superpowers backed their regional allies with open military support, turning the deserts into battlefields for their larger geopolitical struggle. The world truly became a singular, interconnected theatre of war.

As conventional forces bled each other dry, the terrifying specter of nuclear conflict loomed ever larger. The rhetoric of ""tactical"" nuclear weapons, once confined to academic discussions, became part of daily briefings. News reports showed unsettling footage, quickly censored, of SS-20 missile launchers being moved, and B-52 bombers on continuous alert, their bomb bays open for inspection as a chilling display of readiness. Fallout shelter drills, once a formality, were now mandatory, terrifying rituals. Children learned to huddle under desks, their young faces etched with a fear that adults couldn't fully comprehend, or assuage. The constant background hum of global dread intensified into a piercing shriek.

Life transformed utterly. Rationing tightened, encompassing everything from fuel to food. Propaganda saturated every medium, painting the enemy in increasingly monstrous terms, demanding unwavering loyalty and sacrifice. Civilian casualties mounted, not just from direct combat but from the breakdown of infrastructure, disease, and the pervasive anxiety. Hope became a luxury, traded for grim determination. The world, once fearful of nuclear armageddon, now found itself living in a terrifying new normal: an active, all-consuming global conventional war, with the omnipresent, suffocating threat of the unimaginable. The path to de-escalation seemed lost, buried under the rubble of bombed cities and the irreversible momentum of total conflict.
The incessant grind of conventional warfare, the daily casualty counts, the rationing, and the omnipresent dread had become the grim rhythm of life. But then, a new, far more terrifying tempo began. It was not a gradual shift but a sudden, jarring declaration that reverberated across every frequency, through every command center, and into every home. 

Simultaneously, from Washington and Moscow, the chilling pronouncement was made: DEFCON 2.
The world froze. DEFCON 2. ""Cocked Pistol."" It meant the strategic forces were at a heightened state of readiness, just one step away from full nuclear war. For the military, it was the culmination of decades of training, the final, desperate act before annihilation. Launch keys were distributed, target locks confirmed, and communication protocols for firing sequences initiated. Across desolate plains, massive silo doors groaned open, revealing the monstrous tips of intercontinental ballistic missiles, now erect and pointed at unseen continents. Strategic bomber fleets, already airborne on continuous patrols, received their final, coded orders, their fuel tanks topped off for one-way trips, their pilots' faces grim beneath their oxygen masks. Ballistic missile submarines, already submerged in the crushing silence of the deep, activated their final launch procedures, their crews understanding that their next communication might be the command to unleash global destruction. The machinery of apocalypse was fully engaged.

For civilians, the announcement shattered the fragile normalcy they had desperately clung to. Panic, raw and unbridled, erupted. Cities became a chaotic maelstrom of desperate humanity, people fleeing, not knowing where to go, knowing only that remaining meant certain death. Roads jammed, shelters overflowed with terrified families clutching meager belongings, their eyes wide with the knowledge that these concrete and steel bunkers might offer no true sanctuary from the firestorm to come. Radios, tuned to emergency broadcast systems, spewed out static, then terse instructions for a fate no one truly believed would arrive. The low hum of dread that had permeated daily life intensified into an unbearable shriek, a primal scream from a civilization staring into its own self-made void.

A profound, suffocating silence descended in the hours that followed the DEFCON 2 announcement. The conventional fighting, still raging on the front lines, seemed insignificant, a mere distant echo compared to the monstrous, unseen threat now poised above. The world held its breath, waiting for the first flash, the first silent launch, the first confirmation that the final, irreversible act had begun. The somber certainty of total destruction hung in the air, a palpable weight that crushed hope and extinguished every lingering spark of a future. The Cold War, ignited by a torpedo in the Barents Sea, had reached its terrifying, terminal climax, having consumed all reason, and now, it seemed, all life. There was no going back. Only the waiting remained.
The unbearable silence that followed the DEFCON 2 declaration stretched into an agonizing eternity. Days bled into weeks, each moment a fragile thread holding the world back from the brink. The grinding conventional war in Europe, the aerial dogfights, the naval skirmishes across the oceans—all continued, but they felt distant, unreal, merely background noise to the deafening anticipation of the ultimate conflict. People went about their forced routines with glazed eyes, civil defense sirens became a constant mournful wail, and every distant rumble, every unexpected shadow, sent a jolt of terror through the collective consciousness. The air was thick with the scent of fear and the metallic tang of impending doom.

Then, with an almost cosmic synchronicity, the final, unthinkable order came. On both sides of the increasingly thin Iron Curtain, the world was plunged into DEFCON 1.

The announcement wasn't a broadcast, but a command that rippled through military channels with horrifying speed. There was no time for public address, no need for explanations. DEFCON 1: maximum readiness, war imminent. The finality of it was absolute. Across the Soviet Union, launch officers in their subterranean bunkers twisted their keys with grim resolve, the last safeguards removed. In the American heartland, ICBMs, already raised from their silos, received their final coordinates, their silent tips pointed towards predestined destruction. Strategic bombers, flying pre-assigned routes, prepared to activate their payload sequences, their pilots knowing the sky would soon turn to fire. Submarines, ghosts in the deep, received their authorization to release their devastating arsenals, their captains’ faces illuminated only by the cold glow of control panels.

For the vast majority of humanity, the transition was terrifyingly sudden, marked by the cessation of all but essential communication, the last frantic calls unanswered, the world’s networks seizing up under the ultimate load. Emergency lights flickered on in shelters as massive blast doors sealed, trapping frightened families in an echo chamber of their own panicked breaths. The global conventional war ceased, not by order, but by sheer, overwhelming dread. Soldiers in the Fulda Gap, pilots in the skies over Germany, sailors in the Atlantic – all knew. The battle they had been fighting was about to be rendered irrelevant.

A new silence descended upon the Earth, deeper and more profound than any before. It was the silence of anticipation, the collective holding of breath before the inevitable exhale of nuclear fire. The wait was mercifully short. First, a flicker on the distant horizon, then another, spreading like malevolent flowers blooming across the curve of the Earth. The screams of warning sirens were swallowed by the roar of descending warheads, and then, the blinding, all-consuming flash that heralded the dawn of a new, desolate age. The Cold War, born from ideological frost, had culminated in a global conflagration, incinerating the very world it had so long held captive. There was no victory, only oblivion.
The flashes consumed everything. Not just cities, but horizons. Not just land, but ocean. The blinding, all-consuming light was followed by a silence far more profound than any that preceded it—a silence broken only by the distant, sustained roar of the dying atmosphere, the groaning of a world tearing itself apart. There were no winners. There was no victory. Only annihilation.

The absurdity of it all was a scream without a voice. Billions, reduced to cinders and shadows, all because of an escalating distrust of those who, fundamentally, looked like us, dreamt like us, loved like us. We, the average people, fed the narrative. We absorbed the propaganda, amplified the fears, and often, in our quiet complacency or fervent belief, we handed the gun to those in power. We empowered the voices of division, cheered on the rhetoric of 'us versus them,' and allowed the seeds of suspicion to root deep within our communities. The Cold War, a decades-long game of strategic chess, had been overseen by a select few, Premier Volkov, locked in his bunker, and US President Miller, secluded in his command center.
They pulled the final trigger, yes, but their fingers were guided by the collective anxieties and fervent beliefs of entire nations. Maybe Miller's capitalistic ideals were to blame, that people should slave away for the interests of the few, with wealthy corporations dictating his every action. Or maybe Volkov's oppressive actions, dictated by his paranoia and thirst for power, condemning millions to die, oppressing even more. Or maybe you and I were to blame, for allowing both of these monsters to continue to rule, for our mistrust of those so different, yet so alike to us. Our ambition, our paranoia, our monumental selfishness, had poisoned the well of humanity, convincing ourselves that some twisted semblance of ""victory"" could be salvaged from the ashes.

But there would be no more quiet mornings, no more coffee brewing, no more children’s laughter spilling from open windows. No more shared meals where stories were told and memories made. No more comforting hugs from loved ones, no more whispered goodnights, no more gentle hands held tight. The simple, precious rhythm of daily life, the very heart of human connection—a comforting hug, a shared meal, a quiet moment of understanding with a stranger—was gone. Vaporized. The milestones we cherish were erased: no more first days of school, no more proud graduations, no more nervous first kisses under streetlights. No more aging gracefully, watching our children grow into adults, no more dreams of retirement by the sea. The vibrant tapestry of cultures, languages, and histories, woven over millennia, dissolved in an instant of unimaginable heat. The Earth, once teeming with life and human endeavor, became a scorched, poisoned tomb.
Was it worth it? The question hung in the irradiated air, unanswered by the silent, unblinking stars. The distrust, the paranoia, the unwavering belief in an existential enemy that ultimately proved to be itself. The grand ideologies, the geopolitical chess moves, the desperate gambles of men like Volkov and Miller, and the millions who silently assented to their choices, all culminating in this ultimate, irreversible void. In the desolate, ash-choked aftermath, the world became a monument to our folly. Twisted skeletons of skyscrapers clawed at a perpetually twilight sky, veiled by choking dust. Oceans, once vast and blue, turned to poisonous, acidic brews. The vibrant green of forests became a memory, replaced by endless stretches of charred, barren earth, where nothing moved, nothing grew, and no sound dared to break the oppressive silence. Even the wind, when it stirred, carried only the fine grit of what used to be a child's forgotten toy, a lover's whispered promise, the shattered fragments of every single dream ever held. And that was the most disheartening part of it all—that the very possibility of understanding where it all went so terribly wrong, though seemingly preventable at every turn, was ultimately lost forever, a tragic testament to the flaws woven deep within the human heart itself

I noticed something weird about myself and people around me. We complain about everything. Traffic, slow wifi, our coffee being too cold. Meanwhile we live better than 99% of humans who ever existed.

So I'm building something I'm calling **""perspective therapy.""** An app that deliberately puts you through simulated hardship to reset your gratitude levels.

**Here's how it works:** You choose a ""reality check"" session. Maybe it's experiencing homelessness for 10 minutes through audio immersion. Or hearing what it's like to lose everything in a war. The app locks you in - you can't escape until the session ends.

When you come out, your actual problems feel smaller. Your life feels like a gift instead of a burden.

**The tagline I'm testing:** ""Your life isn't hard. Let us show you what is.""

I know this sounds crazy. But think about it - every wellness app tries to add calm to your chaos. What if the problem isn't that we need more peace, but that we've forgotten how good we actually have it?

**The features I'm considering:**
- Immersive audio experiences of real hardship
- ""Reality slap"" notifications when you're complaining about first world problems  
- Gratitude scoring based on contrast therapy
- AI-generated scenarios that put your problems in perspective

I'm calling it counter-therapy. Instead of avoiding discomfort, you lean into it temporarily to appreciate your real life more.

1l3qnkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l3qnkw/i_18m_feel_discontent_in_my_relationship_with_my/,I (18M) feel discontent in my relationship with my girlfriend (19F) I need advice?,"I met my girlfriend (let’s call her Stephanie) at an event. We started talking, clicked, and began dating. I thought she was really pretty, sweet, and funny. It felt great at first.

It’s been a couple of months now… and I’m starting to feel really unhappy.

It feels like things moved too fast. There are a lot of small and big things that are bothering me, and it’s starting to weigh me down. Here are some examples:

She doesn’t have a car, so I always pick her up and drop her off. I didn’t mind at first, but she demands I pick her up super early in the morning for dates, and then gets angry if I’m late even though I’m scrambling to get ready myself. 

I’m a relatively new driver, and I’m not comfortable driving on highways yet. We live in a small town, and the nearest city is an hour away. She gets mad that I don’t want to drive that far.

She constantly wants to go out and do stuff, which I don’t always mind. But I need time to recharge alone at home and she doesn’t seem to get or respect that.

Sometimes she says things that seem like jokes, but they still hurt. Example: I once called her picky, and she replied, “If I’m so picky, why am I dating you?” Or she’ll tell me to “shut up” if I say something she doesn’t like.  I’ve talked to her about it, and she brushed it off, saying, “I’m not used to a sensitive guy, the men in my family aren’t like that.” But I don’t think it’s being sensitive to not want to be insulted by your partner.

I feel like she often overreacts or takes everything negative. One time, we were gonna hangout after I got off work and she was going to get dropped off an hour early and just wait in my car. I suggested she get dropped off near a coffee shop instead, so she wouldn’t overheat. She got mad and told me to “calm down,” even though I was just trying to be thoughtful. Another example: We were taking pictures, and when I asked, “Good?” and she said yes, I assumed we were done. When I started walking away, she got furious that I didn’t want to take more despite her saying we were good.

I feel like I’m putting in more effort emotionally and physically sometimes. On one of our anniversary, I gave her flowers, a card, and her favorite candy. She gave me… 25 cents. In conversations, I ask about her day, her interests, her mood but she rarely asks me anything back. Calls are silent unless I keep the convo alive. Example: She went shopping with her friend. I asked what she did, she said, “Went shopping, got home.” I asked, “What store?” and she said “idk.”

We have met each other’s families, pets, friends, everyone knows we’re together. And I feel like I have to lie to them when they ask about my relationship because I don’t want them to think things are bad. My parents ask if I’m excited to see her and I have to lie. The truth is, I dread it because I know it’s going to be draining.

I feel like we had rushed beginnings, and it hasn’t slowed down. Within the first month, she said “I love you,” and wanted me to meet her parents. I said it back in a panic, and after that, I felt like it was too late to ask to slow things down. I wanted to, but I felt stuck already.

I have tried to communicate, I know communication is very important. I’ve made it a priority. Everything I’ve written here, I’ve already told her in real conversations. There’s been little to no change. She listens, then goes right back to the same behavior.

I know some people might say, “Just break up.” But it’s not that simple for me. We’ve had good times. She does do sweet things occasionally like making little crafts or being considerate when I’m overwhelmed. It’s not all bad, and I don’t want to just throw that away.

But honestly, I feel exhausted. Like I’m constantly giving, constantly explaining, constantly trying to prevent fights… and nothing gets better. I feel like I’ll collapse if something doesn’t change soon.

I keep thinking: Maybe if I’m just a better boyfriend, she’ll treat me better. Or: Maybe if I tell her what’s bothering me one more time, she’ll finally understand. But I’ve already tried. And I’m still tired and unhappy.

If I Did Break Up… Then What? How do I even do it All our friends know we’re dating. Our families ask about us constantly. It feels like we’ve shared too much.

On top of that, she’s moving out of the country for college next year. So it feels like this will end anyway… but I don’t know how to make the call now.

We were back and forth mostly because of lack of commitment, life circumstances and the potential for one of us to move away. Well, he did move away finally, and we said our goodbyes - we had a conversation about how we of course cared for each other, but the potential of us to see new people in our new cities was inevitable and something we may communicate if we had to. He was in town a few times for work, and we kind of resumed old patterns. Shortly after the last time he was in town he sent me the most kind messages - opening up to me about how I made him feel and what I meant to him. Every time we talked he would suggest me coming to visit and stay with him, how he was off all apps, and how he wasnt focused on a love life while there. Well, flash forward a few weeks, and communication changed, and about a month and a half from the sweet messages he sent, I saw a new girl commenting on his socials and playlists filled with songs of love and otherwise (from her to him and him to her). I was crushed. A few weeks after that, it was my birthday and he wished me a happy day, I was in town that weekend and mentioned to him to get a coffee or lunch - he was excited by that and agreed, but then let me know that he was ""seeing someone atm"" and didn't want that to surprise me. I still met with him and everything was normal, more casual than usual, and he seemed great. no mention of her. That was six weeks ago. Since then, every day has been dedicating to healing. I journal, I go to therapy once a week, I work out every day, I read, I spend time outside, I've been doing creative things, I set grieving timers for myself so I don't spend so much time thinking about it everyday, etc. I still can't shake this disappointment, embarrassment, and sadness.

# Best iPhone Privacy Screen Protector 2025: Reviews & Guide

the ubiquitous nature of smartphones has undeniably woven them into the fabric of our daily lives, making them indispensable tools for interaction, entertainment, and work. However, this reliance has also raised concerns about privacy, particularly in public spaces where prying eyes can easily view sensitive data displayed on our screens. An iPhone privacy screen protector offers a simple yet effective solution,obscuring the screen's contents from anyone viewing it from an angle while maintaining clarity for the user directly in front of the phone. As we move into 2025, the market for these protectors is more competitive than ever, with advancements in materials, submission techniques, and viewing angle technology. This guide will explore the best iPhone privacy screen protectors available, providing detailed reviews and insights to help you make an informed decision and safeguard your personal data.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an iPhone privacy screen protector hinges on several key features that determine its level of privacy, clarity, durability, and ease of installation.

**Privacy Angle:** The privacy angle dictates how far to the side someone needs to be to no longer see the screen's content. A narrower angle offers better protection, with some protectors claiming a 30-degree viewing angle from either side. This means someone needs to be at least 30 degrees to your left or right to see a darkened screen.The most effective privacy screen protectors will have a very narrow angle, preventing nearly all side viewing.

The technology behind this feature usually involves micro-louvers, tiny vertical blinds built into the screen protector that restrict light transmission to a narrow cone directly in front of the screen. The tighter the louvers and the more precisely they're aligned, the more effective the privacy filter. Different manufacturers employ variations of this technology, some using a single layer of louvers and others using multiple layers for enhanced privacy.

**Screen Clarity:** Maintaining optimal screen clarity is crucial for user experience. A privacy screen protector inevitably reduces brightness and clarity to some extent, but the best models minimize this impact. Look for protectors that advertise high clarity, frequently enough measured as a percentage. Protectors made with high-quality materials and advanced optical coatings will generally offer better clarity.

Manufacturers have been focusing on optimizing the light transmission properties of the materials used in privacy screen protectors. This includes using advanced adhesives that minimize light scattering and developing coatings that reduce glare and reflections. Some premium protectors even incorporate anti-reflective (AR) coatings to further enhance clarity, particularly in bright environments.

**Scratch Resistance (Hardness):** The scratch resistance of a screen protector is typically measured using the Mohs hardness scale, with most protectors boasting a 9H hardness rating. this means the protector can withstand scratches from common objects like keys, coins, and even knives. Tempered glass is the standard material for achieving this level of hardness.

The manufacturing process for tempered glass screen protectors involves heating the glass to a high temperature and then rapidly cooling it, which increases its strength and scratch resistance. Some manufacturers also add an oleophobic coating to repel fingerprints and smudges, making the screen protector easier to clean. A robust scratch-resistant coating is essential for maintaining the screen protector's clarity and effectiveness over time.

**Application Process:** A user-amiable application process is essential to avoid bubbles, dust, and misalignment.Many protectors come with an installation frame or alignment tool to ensure perfect placement. Instructions should be clear and concise, and the protector should adhere easily to the screen without requiring excessive pressure.

To simplify the application process, manufacturers often include cleaning wipes, dust removal stickers, and squeegees to prepare the screen and remove any imperfections before applying the protector. Some protectors also use a self-adhesive silicone layer that automatically expels air bubbles during installation. The best screen protectors will have an easy installation process, minimizing the chance of user error and ensuring a smooth, bubble-free finish.

## Core Benefits

Using an iPhone privacy screen protector offers several notable benefits that go beyond simply protecting the screen from scratches.

**Enhanced Data Security:** The primary benefit of a privacy screen protector is the enhanced data security it provides. In crowded public settings like trains, buses, or cafes, it's easy for strangers to glance at your phone screen and perhaps view sensitive information like bank details, personal messages, or confidential work documents. A privacy screen protector effectively blocks these prying eyes, ensuring that only you can see what's on your screen. This is particularly vital for professionals handling sensitive data and individuals who value their privacy in public spaces.

**Reduced Visual Hacking:** A privacy screen protector significantly reduces the risk of visual hacking,a form of social engineering where attackers attempt to steal information by observing a user's screen. By limiting the viewing angle, the protector makes it much more difficult for someone to gather confidential data without the user's knowledge. This is especially crucial in industries where sensitive information is regularly accessed or displayed on mobile devices,such as finance,healthcare,and government.

**Protection from Scratches and Smudges:** Along with privacy, these screen protectors also provide a basic level of protection against scratches and smudges. Most models are made from tempered glass with a hardness rating of 9H, which means they can withstand scratches from everyday objects like keys, coins, and even knives. This helps to keep your iPhone's screen in pristine condition, preserving its resale value and ensuring a clear viewing experience. The oleophobic coating found on many protectors also helps to repel fingerprints and smudges, making the screen easier to clean and maintain.

## FAQs Section

**Will an iPhone privacy screen protector affect the touch sensitivity of my screen?**
Most high-quality privacy screen protectors are designed to maintain touch sensitivity. However, cheaper or thicker protectors may slightly reduce responsiveness. If you experience any issues, you can try adjusting the touch sensitivity settings on your iPhone in the Accessibility settings.

**Do privacy screen protectors reduce screen brightness?**
Yes, privacy screen protectors inherently reduce brightness to achieve the privacy effect. However, good quality protectors minimize this reduction. You may need to increase your iPhone's brightness setting slightly to compensate.

**Are privacy screen protectors easy to remove?**
Yes, tempered glass privacy screen protectors are generally easy to remove.You can usually pry up a corner with your fingernail or a plastic tool and then gently peel it off. Be careful not to damage your iPhone's screen during the removal process.

**Will a privacy screen protector work with Face ID?**
Yes, most privacy screen protectors are designed to be compatible with Face ID. They typically have a precise cutout for the front-facing camera and sensors, ensuring that Face ID functions properly. However, it's always a good idea to check the product description to confirm compatibility.

It was early fall on campus, and a slight chill drifted through the courtyard. Leaves rustled at the feet of clustered students, their jackets pulled tight, their laughter light and fleeting like the wind. Among the crowd stood Alex, hands shoved in his hoodie pocket, nerves fluttering in his stomach. He scratched the back of his neck, his voice uncertain but sincere as he stepped a little closer to the girl standing nearby.

“Hey, um… Jean,” he began, his voice catching slightly. “How are you doing? Haven’t seen you since summer. Now it’s fall… and I guess I’m falling again.”

For a moment, there was silence. The small group quieted. Jean blinked, then let out a soft chuckle, her expression unreadable.

“Umm… yeah, Alex,” she said with a polite smile. “That was… a good joke.”

Before the moment could stretch too awkwardly, Paul’s voice cut in like a blade—loud, overly confident, his grin wide as he threw an arm around his girlfriend, Stacey.

“Oh boy, here we go again,” Paul called out. “The ol’ puppy eyes are back. Everyone, brace yourselves—Romeo’s here!”

Stacey laughed softly at first, brushing his arm. But then she gave him a light smack and muttered, “Stop it. Be nice.”

Paul shrugged, still smug. “I am nice. I just don’t care. I didn’t say anything wrong.”

“You know exactly what you did,” Stacey replied, folding her arms.

Alex stood quietly, his eyes lingering on them. It was always like this—Paul would poke fun, Stacey would giggle and scold him, but she never really pulled away. Alex couldn’t help but wonder: if she didn’t like how Paul acted, why did she still lean into him like that?

Jean turned to him again, gently changing the subject. “Anyway… it was a great summer. How was yours?”

Alex forced a grin. “Oh, it was wild. Fought monsters, investigated the paranormal, stopped Desmond from unleashing alien tech—saved the world.”

In his mind, it played out like a comic book. In reality, he’d spent the summer working behind the counter at a 7-Eleven.

Jean smiled kindly. “Well… at least you had fun.”

“I’ve gotta run,” she added. “Class is calling. Bye, guys.”

She walked off with that same graceful ease, and Alex waved. Then he turned toward Paul, frustration creeping into his voice.

“Come on, man. You’re my best friend. Why do you always gotta call me out in front of everyone?”

Paul laughed, already heading off. “Best friend? Please. You did this to yourself. Anyway, I’m not getting caught in your girl drama. I’m out.”

He walked away, leaving Alex standing alone in the courtyard. A sigh escaped Alex’s lips. He crouched down, picking up a small stone from the cracked pavement and rolled it between his fingers. The sky above was gray, thick with clouds.

“Fall sucks. College sucks,” he muttered to himself. “But hey… class is about to start.”

He tossed the stone aside and rushed off, late again.



It was a rainy Friday night at CJ’s Diner, one of the most popular spots for any college dorm crowd. Paul and Stacey were obviously together. Stacey was quiet and reserved, while Paul stayed quiet but observant, wearing a classic black and brown combo.
Stacey looked effortlessly graceful, wearing a typical white shirt and blue jeans.
They were the long-term couple — going strong for six years, high school sweethearts.
The school crowd was there, and so was Jean — tall, with long brown hair that curled softly over her shoulders. She smiled with grace and care. Everyone was having a swingin’ time.
Alex walked in.
“Sooo… Paul, thanks for the invite.”
Paul, exaggerating: “Who invites this guy again? Alright, I’ma head out.”
Stacey laughed, brushing his arm. “You’re funny. But stop — be nice.” Then she turned to Alex with a monotone voice, but a warmth behind it. “Hi, Alex.”
Then came Jeremy — long-haired, rugged.
“Paul, you’re such a jerk,” he said. “Leave him alone. Come on, Alex. Sit down.”
Alex tried, “Come on, Paul… you intend me, right?”
Paul replied, “Loser? No. But whatever, I’ma be nice today, I guess.”
As they all ordered food, Alex had a slice of pie with coffee. Jeremy had wings, listening to the soft jazz playing across the room. Paul and Stacey shared pancakes drizzled with syrup, while Paul munched on a ham and cheese sandwich. Alex looked around, enjoying the space and warmth in the air.
Boom.
Alex froze.
He saw her — Jean — walking in through the diner door, laughing with her friends. And just like that, something shifted inside him. His breath caught. It wasn’t just attraction; it was like gravity. A pull. As if the whole room dimmed and she was the only thing glowing.
Time slowed for a second.
Her hair flowed over her shoulders like soft waves, her smile easy and kind. She looked like she didn’t have to try to be beautiful — she just was.
“Guys… she’s here. She’s here,” Paul muttered, finishing his food.
But Alex wasn’t listening to Paul anymore. He was still staring at Jean.
Paul snorted. “Bruh, I feel bad for that girl. She gotta deal with you. Poor girl gonna suffer.”
Alex, timid — like a scared kid reaching for a flashlight: “Shut up, Paul. I’m just asking for an honest opinion.”
Paul shot back, “Yeah, and I’m giving you one, freak.”
Jeremy barked, “Wanker! You’re so rude to him. What did he do to you?”
Paul shrugged, “He was born. And annoying.”
He smirked, “Watch — he gonna go over there like a little boy, say hi, and be weird.”
Stacey, drawn into the conversation: “Why are you always like this, babe? What’s going on with you two?”
Paul shrugged, “Nothing. He started it.”
Alex sighed, “Ugh. Never mind. Sorry I asked.”
“Well guys,” he said, “I made money this week. I’ll pay for the appetizers and stuff.”
Paul lifted his coffee, warm and calm. “Thanks, buddy.”
Stacey smiled. “Yeah, thanks, Alex. Really sweet of you.”
Jeremy grinned, “You got money now, huh? Lol — thanks, man.”
Alex left quietly, picking up the crumpled twenty dollars he’d made doing a quick oil change.




It was a rainy Friday night at CJ’s Diner, one of the most popular spots for any college dorm crowd. Paul and Stacey were obviously together. Stacey was quiet and reserved, while Paul stayed quiet but observant, wearing a classic black and brown combo.
Stacey looked effortlessly graceful, wearing a typical white shirt and blue jeans.
They were the long-term couple — going strong for six years, high school sweethearts.
The school crowd was there, and so was Jean — tall, with long brown hair that curled softly over her shoulders. She smiled with grace and care. Everyone was having a swingin’ time.
Alex walked in.
“Sooo… Paul, thanks for the invite.”
Paul, exaggerating: “Who invites this guy again? Alright, I’ma head out.”

Am I in incredible nerve pain today? Also yes. Hello. Rain and thunderstorms are the best. On a random note I can go for a lovely thunderstorm. Need the booms and flashes in my life. It's 1255am and I need a coffee or redbull or a never ending supply of cheese fries. I guess some might say I'm feeling lonely.  I know I sound amazing so please glide on into my DM's. 

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

I'm down for swapping selfies and moving onto other platforms if things are cool. 

Bonus points if you like dancing queen. Medical problems - cause I do. Or have an accent. I'm American and I don't have one. Also so far posting on here my luck is nill. Some questionable people.

The big boys are mine, the little buds are from my dad. 

While yes, the sound is usually very V-shaped and very ""crowd pleasing"", their boomy bass is fun, specially for hip-hop and sometimes I just want to get my earwax vibrating lol. Tho ive heard that the Airpods Pro 2 frecuency response is pretty good actually, Ive heard them for very little time since they are my dad APP2, but they definetely sound good for what they are.

But the noise cancelling, oh dear... Ive tried them and simulated them in malls, planes, on the road, on coffee shops, office, etc. Its really mind blowing watching how the world around you is still going but the noise just dissapears like you are on a dream. Yes, the noise dont dissapear 100% usually, but damn its getting close.

Ive had the QC Ultra and XM5 for about half a year, my dad has his APP2 since a couple of months, and both of his WH-XM4 and WF-XM4 for some years already. But even after so many hours using them they still surprise me very often!
