1k0u5dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/1k0u5dw/my_lawsuit_against_alden_global_capital_for/,My lawsuit against Alden Global Capital for interfering with Journalism,"Regarding Colorado District Court Case No. 2025-CV—11

I defeated their ANTISLAPP and other motion to dismiss and reset the stage for my commercial claims against Alden Global Capital and its owners for underfunding their news companies too much. I also have owners, Randall Smith and Heath Freeman locked in as defendants in their personal capacity.

They alerted me that they are imminently preparing to refile another anti-SLAPP motion. If they do, it will be procedurally too late—well beyond the 63-day statutory deadline—and substantively inapplicable, as the case concerns commercial speech, not protected opinion.

The intentional depletion of resources is beyond the breaking point. No matter how hard some reporters and editors across Smith and Freeman’s newspaper conglomerate may try, due to the massive extraction of profits while constantly squeezing resources, their own self-created journalistic standards can no longer be met.

My name is Drew from Boulder. For those grandparents out there you may know me as the writer and producer of Rocketboom which was the first daily video news program on the web. My mission with Rocketboom was to help democratize the moving image.

If you are younger at heart, but not too much, you may know me as the creator of Know Your Meme, a user content generated platform that became the authority on internet meme culture. My mission with Know Your Meme was to document how information spreads.

Well.

A third site I created called Humanwire allowed people to connect one-to-one with people displaced by war. The site was effective at offering personalized humanitarian support.

Long story short, much like Gregor woke up one morning to Kafka’s profile of a cockroach, I woke up one morning to the Denver Post’s profile of a con man. The false report indicated my site was a scam, triggered a false arrest, and I faced 12 years in jail.

After my lawyers pointed out that the portrayal in the Denver Post was false, my case was eventually dismissed but it took three years to get it fully completed, sealed and removed from official databases. By that time, the Denver Post and its sister The Daily Camera had six stories about me as an archetype criminal.

Each time I tried to go back to show the reporters and editors evidence of what happened, they just pointed at the exit without looking and without any discussion. I assumed it had to do with their liability or embarrassment for being wrong, but I kept looking for someone, assuming there must be someone who cares enough to at least sit down once over a cup of coffee and look through the documents.

This is going to sound crazy but over the last seven years I haven’t been able to find anyone. And I have not been able to live with it. Not at all. Not even for one day. I have been stuck with this profile just as intensely and kafkaesque as could be. People in my small town see me through the eyes of the reporters who they trust, and thus won’t take me seriously, and the same is true for most of my family, friends, and colleagues. For the last seven years, I’ve been completely isolated, simply moving through the system, living my own life, raising my son by trying to integrate him the best I can, and working intently on resolving the issue as my main focus, without any known legal means.

I never expected anyone at their companies to care about me, but I expected to find someone who cared to make sure their organization is true, and that their reports are fair and accurate as they promise in their policies. I never found anyone who cares enough, I found exclusive and limited care towards some. Of all things that could go wrong at any business, not caring as a culture is a sure sign of trouble.

This discovery — the lack of care for their own journalism — sent me deep into a years-long investigation of the companies behind it all. I haven’t just been sitting around; I’ve been conducting my own investigation into their behavior. Aside from raising my son it’s all I have to account for the time.

Somebody needs to care somewhere, Alden is the second largest business of newspapers in America. Most people agree that ethical journalism had difficulty getting a footing with Americans across the press during the last election, leading to confusion about what’s true and why. But Alden’s business strategies are not known to lead to viability, they involve vulture investing. They buy distressed companies and disassemble them on purpose to sell off the assets, like Greyhound (they have been selling off the bus terminals around America too.)

Here in Colorado where I’m based, my investigation shows they’ve gone way too far with the underfunding and can no longer keep up with their own promises for maintaining the journalistic standards outlined in their own policies. The Denver Post for example is profitable year-over-year but the owners ratchet down the resources and extract profits out. Even the workers who appear to try the hardest seem to often fail because of the lack of support.

Companies are free to set their own journalistic standards and rules - whatever they want — and some media companies have no ethics policy at all (eg The National Enquirer). The Denver Post has a rigorous ethical journalism policy that I found they no longer uphold on a regular basis due to the lack of resources and care. This is different than putting out a bad news article here and there or making mistakes, and it’s a big problem beyond just my own personal grievances. My grievances are essentially a result of this bigger problem of care. They are now disregarding entire policies and finding work-arounds to keep moving forward even as they head further downwards with their capabilities. But if they updated their policies, it would be embarrassing and profits would go down.

Here in Colorado, I discovered what’s called the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, which is designed to broadly remove legal friction for consumers seeking to hold any business accountable for unfair or deceptive practices. Through a novel application, I am using the Act to come forward as a consumer who was harmed, to expose the dangers other consumers face. I am now, through this Act, standing up on behalf of all consumers in Colorado to present the data that fits the statutes and to have the court decide whether protection is duly warranted.

The remedy includes injunctive orders that would compel Alden to remove or revise its commercial promises about how it produces informational reports—replacing them with representations that realistically reflect the diminished capacity of its current operations.

This case is no longer just about me, a story, or a single hedge fund. It could have an effect in helping to define the future of journalism in America.

If successful, it would help establish a legal precedent that draws a brighter line between journalism and other forms of media that serve purely commercial, ideological, or entertainment goals. All journalism is media — but not all media is journalism.

Genuine “ethical journalism” is not a constant but its practice is grounded in principles of public service, verification, accountability, and editorial independence. When owners like Alden Global Capital strip newsrooms beyond what they need to assure these principles and prioritize profit extraction over public trust, they erode those principles until the product is indistinguishable from opinion, propaganda, or noise. The average reader is then left in a state of confusion, unable to tell what has been reported, verified, and checked against competing facts — and what has simply been published.

That’s the danger: when commercial policies distort journalistic output to such a degree that it no longer functions as journalism. By seeking injunctive relief, I aim not only to hold Smith and Freeman accountable but to reaffirm the standards that distinguish journalism from other media. In doing so, we move closer to a media environment in which the public can more clearly see what is true, and trust once again in the Fourth Estate.

Such an action does not interfere with free speech. Any company can make their own policy and no policy is the most free. This is a matter of making sure companies do not profit off of ethical journalism through deception and bad business practices.

(Dandelion & Grape Hyacinth),"Just wanted to share this experience, it's not much in terms for 'real foraging' whatever that may be, but I thought it funny, plus on the edge of my property nearest to the forest, a TON of **Dandelions** and **Muscari Armeniacum**, I spent a couple hours picking, cleaning, overall preparing the two flowers and making them each into flavored syrups. L:

The dandelions went super smoothly, after straining out the main petals and such, I used coffee filters to get out most (90%\~?) of any pollen, I know it's technically good for you- but I'm also technically allergic if there's any tree pollen mixed in lol.  
It came out super wonderful, although it did smell strangely like **potatoes** when I was steeping it, and pre-sweetened also *tasted* like some kinda potato tea (Do not reccomend tbh lol)  
But after boiling it down for an hour or so with a cup of 2/3 turbinado sugar, and 1/3 white sugar, I was left with a super delicate flavor reminiscent of floral honey, next time I'll use less turb-sugar for a bit less caramel taste, still good tho.  
Love putting it in with club soda's, and I WILL find out a way to make a clone of Buc-ees candied cashews with this syrup. (One day...)

  
The Muscari did *not* turn out as well, I got to it a bit later in the day and thought ""Eh it's late, I'll boil for a minute or two to kill bugs & bacteria, then let it steep overnight for more flavor.""  
**Big mistake.**  
I woke up and prepared what ended up more like extract than ""flavored,"" and made it with same sugar proportions as the dandelion recipe and ***EECHKH*** tasted like the grape medicine you hate as a kid, but with a somehow worse, more medicinal aftertaste?? I added double sugar, boiled it down a bit, and honestly am contemplating just tossing it because I likely will not be eating it lmao! If I can use it for hummingbird feed (w/ dilution likely) definitely lmk, maybe I'll ask a bird feeding subreddit for that.  
Otherwise, make sure you don't steep your flowers for too long because sometimes you don't want EVERY flavor to show it's face haha.",4,1744833830.0,foraging,0,1.0,False

I work closely with a boomer woman who I mostly get along with. Most of the boomer tendencies she has I can roll my eyes and move on with, but the one thing I’ve been struggling with for the last six or so months with her is the fact that she cannot leave the topic of food alone.

Every time she sees me walking around with a snack/drink she’ll go “hmm is that something nutritious at least?” Or make comments on my lunch like “I remember the days I could eat that” (I’m a vegetarian and a known runner so my meals are usually high in protein and veg and sometimes carbs but not usually unhealthy).

She also has to have an out loud argument with herself on if she can have a candy from our office dish or will loudly announce that yes, she is in fact having a second cup of coffee. 

Does anyone have advice on how to deal with these comments??? Is this normal??? I usually can just get over things like this but for some reason this one is annoying me to hell and back.

My question to them was about dark roasting, like an oily French roast. They suggested thisb(pictured) popcorn style machine would do what I like. Here's their link... (https://www.sweetmarias.com/poppo-air-popcorn-kit.html)

My first thought was, okay, it's cheap and 1400 watts so can probably and simply get me to the dark I prefer. I'm guessing consistency of roast and heat can be an issue.

As I travel the cheap rabbit hole of coffee roasting it gets blurry. I would be really pleased if a super inexpensive option like this would actually work for me.

There are many little ones online and Amazon has a bunch. If anyone has suggestions on cheap roasting please inform me.

What I'd like:

I want electric. 

I DON'T want any coated metal/aluminum (nonstick etc.).

I want to roast at least 4oz minimum.

I didn't think I want heat and time control at this price point since I'm expecting the variability in this price range to be hit or miss. Seems I would need to keep a closer eye while roasting on a cheap device like this in general.

Lastly, am I diluted into thinking a very cheap roaster will be sufficient? Should I wait, save my money and buy a better one? I wouldn't want to spend more than $250-$300 though.

Thanks everyone!

1k0ts67,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k0ts67/mr_silvergleid_is_not_available_for_appointments/,Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments.,"In the heart of the city stands an abandoned bakery.

It is a high, sprawling complex of brick and granite, and its great smokestack still stands watch over the loading bays where fleets of gleaming trucks once began their journeys to supermarkets across New England.

Now the weeds grow long and tall across the parking lot, and the great ovens sit silent upon the darkened factory floor.  Only the former administrative wing shows signs of occasional life, having been refurbished as office space and rented out to small businesses whose clientele will not be intimidated by the great emptiness next door.

Tonight, as the clock strikes eleven, only one of these offices remains lit.   The rear window – heavily frosted, and recently installed – reveals only the vaguest of shadows to the outside world.  Behind it, a stout, graying, and exquisitely dressed gentleman hunches over a massive writing-desk that is entirely devoid of electronic devices.  The only adornment is a single faded photograph of a dark-haired lady, standing before a trellis that bursts with flowers.

The man’s muttonchop whiskers give him the appearance of a latter-day Ebenezer Scrooge, and the fabric of his suit appears both expensive and somehow oddly-cut.  His brow furrows in concentration as his pen flies over sheet after sheet of thick, cream-hued paper, filling each with flowing script that seems to crackle with urgency.

The desk drawer at his left elbow stands open, and with his left hand he places each finished page into it even as his right drops the pen and reaches for a fresh sheet.

This is my boss, Mr. Silvergleid.  He is not available for appointments.

I state this latter fact because doing so is a duty of my employment.  I have other duties: ensuring a fresh pot of coffee on the burner, keeping the stocks of paper and pens filled to Mr. Silvergleid’s specifications, occasionally patrolling the immediate perimeter of the office to ensure that ""all is in order"" (whatever that may mean) – but the core of my mandate is quite clear.

Do not make any appointments for Mr. Silvergleid.

""That’s right, kid,"" he’d told me at the interview, as I blinked and tried to decide whether to chuckle.  ""Ten to two, every weeknight.  And you don’t let anyone past you, and you *don’t* make any appointments.  Not any.  Can you do that?""

I’d thought about it as the sun sank low over the crumbling houses across the street.  ""What if someone needs to talk to you?"" I asked at last.

Mr. Silvergleid smiled, and it did not reach his eyes.  ""They don’t.  You know anyone who’s just gotta jaw with a guy like me in the middle of the night?  Nah, kid, they might say they do.  But they don’t.  All you gotta do is send ‘em away so I can focus on my work.  And how are you gonna do that?  Say it for me, kid.""

I cleared my throat.  ""Um, Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments.""

Mr. Silvergleid clapped me on the shoulder, and his smile seemed more genuine now.  ""You’ll do fine, kid.  Welcome aboard.""

Now, tonight, I sit at my desk in the outer office and consider whether I truly need another cup of coffee.  On my desk sits a half-finished project for one of my architectural classes – if nothing else, the job affords me ample leisure to focus on my schoolwork.  Behind me, the door to Mr. Silvergleid’s office is shut as always.  Warm golden light spills through the frosted window, and beyond I see only the vague shadow of my employer bent over his desk.

The door to the outside swings open.

This is both unexpected and largely unprecedented.  I have by now been in Mr. Silvergleid’s employment for almost three weeks, and our association has settled into a predictable routine.  I arrive shortly before ten, put on a pot of coffee, and greet Mr. Silvergleid as he bustles in and closes his office door gently behind him.  Four hours later, he emerges and hands me a crisp stack of bills as he bids me good night.

In the interim, I am free to pursue whatever avenues of inquiries suggest themselves, so long as the coffee remains hot and the stationary stacked high.

Our cozy arrangement has been interrupted only twice – once by a gentleman in a sleeveless shirt who wishes to ascertain whether this is Nasty Boy’s joint, and a second time by a dark-haired beauty whom I recognize immediately from the photograph on Mr. Silvergleid’s desk.  She offers a cheery wave and deposits on my desk a large plate covered in foil.

""Nathan, isn’t it?  So nice to meet you.  I just swung by to drop this off.  To welcome you to the firm, so to speak.""  She dimples when she smiles.

I smile back; it is good to see a friendly face, and to meet the elusive Mrs. Silvergleid in person.  She has changed little from her photo, and while younger than her husband, exudes something of the same Victorian spirit.  I carefully peel back the foil to reveal a bountiful pile of home-baked muffins dotted with chocolate chips and strawberries.

""From our house to yours,"" says Mrs. Silvergleid.  ""No, no, don’t get up.  I know how he gets about interruptions.  I just wanted to say welcome aboard.  And…"" she trails off.

""Ma’am?"" I say at last.

""And just be careful,"" she says.  ""Be *strict*.  If you ever need to talk…"" she shrugs.  ""I’ll stop by once in a while.  I know you’ll do great.""  And she is gone into the night.

I am still thinking about her words when I realize I have finished the muffins and am hungry for more.  The perils of the night shift, I suppose.

Other than these brief interludes, we have entertained no visitors.  As Mr. Silvergleid himself said, why would we?

Tonight, though, the door opens.  And a man comes in from the dark.

\_\_\_

He is tall, thin, gangly – so tall, in fact, that he has to bend his head slightly as he passes through the doorframe.  He is clad in an olive-drab greatcoat and a battered brown hat, which he removes politely as he enters.  His face somehow brings to mind both a scheming Roman senator and a plow-horse well past its prime.

He smiles at me with his mouth.  ""Mr. Silvergleid?"" he says, pointing toward the inner office, and makes as if to step past me.

I am still trying to adjust to this sudden break in my routine, but I do have the presence of mind to hold up a finger.  ""Um, your name, sir?""

He stops, shakes his head as if in self-admonition.  ""Of course.  I am deacon Keyhole.  I serve at Mr. Silvergleid’s church in a pastoral, or perhaps an administrative, capacity.  There is, I regret to say, a problem with the lights.  If I may?""  He gestures to the inner office.

To say that these remarks throw me off-balance would be putting it mildly.  Deacon Keyhole’s watery blue eyes are fixed on mine, and they belie his friendly smile.  I look away, busy myself with the papers on my desk.

""I am very sorry, sir,"" I say to one of them.  ""Mr. Silvergleid is not available for appointments.""

Deacon Keyhole does not answer.  And when the silence stretches too long and I look up, the office is empty.

I am seized with alarm.  The outer door remains closed; deacon Keyhole must have taken advantage of my preoccupation to sneak past me into Mr. Silvergleid’s office.  My employer will doubtless be displeased, and I will lose a job which has provided me with both quiet study time and a growing bank balance.  I lurch from my chair and rip open the inner door to Mr. Silvergleid’s sanctum, a hasty apology already forming on my lips.

Mr. Silvergleid is at his desk, writing, undisturbed.  He looks up with mild concern.  ""Everything all right, kid?""  He is, as ever, alone.

I blink, staring at each corner of the room in turn.  ""I – uh – deacon Keyhole – ""

Mr. Silvergleid relaxes and nods, as if in perfect understanding.  ""You did great, kid.  It’s like I said.  No one needs to be in here.""

I look back into the outer office, expecting to surprise deacon Keyhole hiding behind a flowerpot or a filing-cabinet.  ""But he’s still – where’d he go?""  And I tell Mr. Silvergleid, albeit with much stammering and head-scratching, about the visitor.

Mr. Silvergleid looks me straight in the eye, man to man.  ""He’s gone, kid.  You don’t need to worry about him; he won’t be back.""  He sighs and picks up his pen.  ""Just be ready for the next one.""

I pause with my hand on the door-handle.  ""Did – does he really go to your church?""

""That guy and church don’t mix,"" says Mr. Silvergleid.  ""Keep up the good work, kid.""  And he bends over his writing-paper.

\_\_\_

I am left with several questions.

I do not, for the time being, trouble Mr. Silvergleid with them when he emerges from his office and hands me my nightly packet.  For instance, I do not ask why he employs me to turn away visitors instead of simply locking the door to keep them out.  Perhaps I do not truly want to know the answer.

And I am, of course, back at my station the following night.

I do not pretend to understand all the dynamics at play, but I do not need to.  My part is simple: make coffee, refuse appointments.  At the rates Mr. Silvergleid is paying, I can do this with pleasure.

Nothing happens that night, or the next.  I do take Mr. Silvergleid’s admonition to patrol the perimeter somewhat more seriously, and at least once an hour I step forth into the dark and pace the cracked sidewalk in front of the office.

But the tranquillity of the night is unbroken.  There is no sound but my footsteps and the wind through the tall grasses.

On Friday, Mr. Silvergleid calls me into his office.  He takes a sheaf of finished papers from his desk drawer and begins to place them into a large manila envelope.  ""Something a bit different tonight, kid,"" he says, then curses as one of the sheets goes astray and flutters to the desk in front of me.

I pick it up and hold it out to him, making an active effort to avoid reading what is written upon it; to do so would seem a violation of Mr. Silvergleid’s privacy, at a minimum.  However, my eye cannot help but catch a fragment or two as he thanks me and returns it to the stack:

*…Legionnaire’s Daughter and the Duchess are especially dangerous –*

*…guardian can ultimately can be neutralized only by –*

*…used to open directly to the Orangery, but on my most recent visit –*

Mr. Silvergleid seals the envelope and slides it across the desk to me.  ""You’re gonna take this to a guy named Saul.  Good guy, friend of mine.  Don’t give it to anyone else.  Here’s the address.""  He scribbles a few lines on an index card.  ""You shouldn’t be bothered. But if you are, meet me here.""  He scribbles on another card and passes it to me along with my night’s salary.  The stack of bills seems slightly thicker than usual.

""You can head home when it’s done.  See you Monday – and keep those cards.  We do this every week from here on out.""

I stand and put the cards in my wallet.  ""Yes, sir.  How will I know Saul?""

""He’s gonna ask you if you like steak.  You’re gonna say, only if it’s cooked right.""  He grabs his coat and hat from the coat-rack.  ""Don’t write that one down.  It’s gonna change every time.""

I think of asking why it will be necessary to use a passphrase once I know what Saul looks like.  Instead I nod and ask: ""Leaving early tonight, sir?""

He shrugs.  ""You’ll be gone.  Someone might come in.""

I follow him out into the night.  And though the breeze is warm, I feel a chill.

\_\_\_

The delivery goes without incident.  Saul, a quiet man with a firm handshake, meets me in an empty function room beneath a busy downtown hotel.  He asks after my health and slips the envelope into a secure briefcase, and within fifteen minutes I am safely home.

On Monday, the fire alarm goes off.

It is just before midnight – I have settled in with my schoolwork and a large coffee, iced in deference to the late spring heat.  Suddenly there are footsteps pounding down the stairs from the upper level, a sharp and jarring smell of smoke – and the wail of a klaxon piercing the air as a fully-clad firefighter emerges into the office.

He is a middle-aged man, red-faced and winded, with a long dark moustache and an air of brisk competence frayed by great pressure.  His eyes bulge when he sees me.  ""Buddy, you can’t – is there anyone else still in here?""  He clicks his shoulder radio, speaks into it: ""Control, suite 7 is *not* clear, I repeat, *not* clear.  I need additional hoses over here, *now*!""

His alarm is infectious.  I glance over at the door to Mr. Silvergleid’s office, but it is as ever:  a vague shadow, bent over a desk.  I rise from my chair, and the firefighter is there: standing at my shoulder, urging me toward the door.  ""This place is going up, buddy,"" he shouts over the alarm.  ""Get out there and get across the street.  You ain’t got much time.  Sprinklers ain’t even working right.  Go, *go*!""

I gulp, look around the office.  ""My boss – ""

The firefighter glares at Mr. Silvergleid’s office, shakes his head.  ""You gotta be – he deaf or somethin’?""

Something tickles at the back of my mind.  ""I’ll get him,"" I shout.  ""You go on.  We’re right behind you.""

He shakes his head.  ""No time, buddy.  You got to go, *now*.  He in there?""  He points at Mr. Silvergleid’s office, steps away from me and toward the inner door.

But he does not open it.

I stand there in the smell of smoke, with the alarm-klaxon drilling into my brain, and I try to think.  I take a deep breath and look the firefighter straight in the eyes.  ""Mr. Silvergleid,"" I say,  ""is not available for appointments.""

The alarm stops.

The air is clear of smoke.

And a smile begins to spread across the firefighter’s face.  He places both of his rubber-gloved hands on my desk and leans in close.

""Do you want to see,"" he asks, ""what my eyes *really* look like?""

I do not.  And before I know it, I have stumbled away from him and out the front door.

In the parking lot, all is quiet.  There are no alarms, no smoke.  And no fire trucks, of course.  Why would there be?

My battered Dodge Charger sits waiting in the parking lot.  I fumble in my pocket for the keys, still staggering backwards, expecting the firefighter to emerge any moment – to emerge and to show me his eyes.  But he does not – no one does.

And as my hand finds the keys – I realize: *Mr. Silvergleid is still in his office*.

With the firefighter.

I stop, breathing hard, and I force my body to walk back to the office.  The door hangs open.  I grip the frame hard with both hands and peer inside.

The outer office is empty.  And Mr. Silvergleid’s door is still shut.  Through the frosted window, his shadow writes on.

I collapse into my desk-chair and begin to shake.

I do not know how long I would have remained that way if left to myself, and in any case I am eventually roused by a soft voice at the door: ""Nathan?  *Nathan*!""

Mrs. Silvergleid enters, another foil-covered plate in her hands, and hastens over to my desk.  She sets the plate aside in a single practiced motion and takes my hands in hers.  ""Oh, no.  Poor Nathan.  Was it bad?""

I am still breathing hard, but her presence is calming.  I tell her, as best I can, about the firefighter.  ""I don’t – who *are* these people, ma’am?  And what do they want with your husband?""

Her eyes and voice are hard.  ""I don’t know.  Not exactly.  But I know that for two pins I’d march in there and tell him exactly what I think of him putting a young man like you in a position like this.  Better save it for breakfast, I suppose.""  She stands.  ""If you want to quit, Nathan, no one could ever blame you.  I’ll see to it that you get some money to send you on your way.  Just say the word.""

But I stand, and I meet her eyes.  ""No, ma’am.  Mr. Silvergleid’s been good to me, and it’s the right job.  I won’t let them chase me off.""

She presses her lips together.  ""Very well.  I think I’d better start coming by every night.  Just to check.""  She stops at the door and turns.  ""Be well, Nathan.  And remember – you don’t have to do this.""

""Yes, ma’am,"" I say.  But she is already gone.

\_\_\_

The next evening, there is a detour – a water main has burst, it seems, beneath one of the city’s busiest streets.  Traffic is routed several blocks to the west, and I decide to walk.  I park the Charger in front of a neon-lit Mexican restaurant, and a man steps out from beneath the awning.

""Nathan?"" he says.  ""Nathan T— ?""

I spin around.  The man is tall, thin, well-dressed.  He holds both hands up in a gesture of peace.  In one of them is a leather billfold with an ID inside.  He offers this to me with a smile.  ""I’m glad I caught you.  I was gonna come to your apartment, but this is better.  Name’s Phil.  I’m a private eye.""  I glance at the ID.  It is indeed a private investigator’s license, with Phil’s full name and photograph.  I nod, and it disappears into his pocket.  ""Let’s take a walk,"" he says.

I carry on toward the bakery, and Phil makes no objection.  ""I’ll be brief,"" he says.  ""I know you gotta work.  Let’s start with what we both know.""  He holds up a hand and starts ticking off fingers as he speaks.

""You’re a private secretary to a guy named Silvergleid.  Been in the job about a month.  Every night he writes, and last week he had you take what he’s written and deliver it to someone.""  He clears his throat.  ""Now this part we ain’t too sure about, but we think the contact is a Saul P–.  And we think you don’t know exactly what it is you been turning over to him.""

""Um, no comment,"" I say.  ""Do I need to call my lawyer or something?""

Phil chuckles.  ""I ain’t the police, son.  I got a boss, just like you.  Difference is, my boss didn’t tell me to do a bunch of stuff that’s gonna get me in trouble.""

I shake my head.  ""Trouble?  You mean Mr. Silvergleid’s in the Mafia or something?  I don’t buy it.""  I glare at Phil.  ""And he’s not available for appointments, either.""

Phil holds up both hands.  ""I ain’t asking for an appointment, son.  I know how he is about that.  And I know telling you to get me in there ain’t gonna buy me much.""  He sighs.  ""No, he ain’t Mafia.  We actually think this guy Saul is working for the Chinese Communist Party.  And that Silvergleid’s selling stuff to him.  Stuff that belongs to my employer.""

I shrugged.  ""So call the police.  Or the FBI.  Or – ""

Phil cuts me off.  ""You seen anything weird, son?  At Silvergleid’s, I mean.""

I press my lips together and walk faster.  The bakery is three blocks away.

""Sure you have.  I see it in your face.""  He matches my speed, his face hard and focused.  ""You ever wonder where Silvergleid works during the day?  Well, I’m not gonna name names, but you’d know the place.  A lot of the things they work on, a Communist spy would pay plenty for.  And one of them is a gas to give enemy soldiers violent hallucinations.  You feel me, son?""

And I do.  I do not want to, but I do.  Phil sees this in my face, too.  ""That’s right.  Just the thing to confuse the bad guys before we attack.  Or convince an innocent kid to trust a thief.""

He glances around.  ""We’re almost there now.  And I can’t be seen.  But I want you to take this.""  He shoves something into my pocket – a business card, I see briefly before it disappears.

""When you make your delivery on Friday, you call me.  I’ll have a team ready.  We’ll steam that envelope open, real careful, and we’ll copy what’s inside.  If I’m wrong, no harm no foul.  If I’m right, we’re gonna find out just exactly what the boys in Beijing have been paying Mr. Silvergleid for.""

He stops and holds up a finger.  We are close to the bakery now; it is clear he will come no further.  ""Why do you do it?  Two reasons, son.

""First, we’ll pay you for your trouble, but I don’t think that’s what matters to you.  What matters to you is doing the right thing.  Your boss tried to make you a patsy so he could sell military secrets to Communists.  You okay with that?  No, you aren’t.  So you’re gonna do the right thing.  Your boss goes away, my employers are happy, our soldiers are safe.""

He taps me on the chest.  ""Friday.  You hang onto that card.  You call me.""  He turns and is gone into the gathering dusk.

\_\_\_

Friday arrives, and I am not ready.

A powerful thunderstorm grips the city, and I awake with a pounding headache that dogs me throughout the afternoon.  Even migraine pills and strong black coffee only dull the discomfort.  I arrive at the bakery bleary-eyed and unsure of myself.

Mr. Silvergleid, for his part, seems troubled as well.  As he walks through the door, lightning cracks overhead, and he whirls with his silver-tipped cane gripped tightly in both hands.  The thunder rolls away, and he sighs and relaxes.  The smile he gives me as he makes his way to the inner office seems more forced than usual.

I pray, as I fumble with the coffee-pot, that Mrs. Silvergleid will appear, that I will find a way to confide in her and seek her advice without directly accusing her husband of being a traitor to the Republic.  But she does not, and soon enough Mr. Silvergleid’s door opens and he calls me in.

""Delivery day, kid,"" he says, stuffing papers into a new manila envelope and sealing it tight.  ""Just as well, really.  Looks like you’re not feeling it today, and I don’t blame you.  Go home after this and get some sleep.""  He hands me the envelope and my salary, but does not go to the rack for his hat and coat.  ""Saul’s gonna ask if you played baseball last week.  You’re gonna tell him yeah, but the game got rained out.  Good luck, kid.""

I nod, still unsure.  ""Yes, sir.  Are you coming?""  Despite my misgivings, the thought of him alone in the office fills me with disquiet.

He shakes his head.  ""Not just yet.  Something I gotta take care of first.""  He gives me the best grin he can, and I appreciate the effort.  ""Don’t worry about me, kid.  I been doing this a long time.  Someone shows up, I’ll send ‘em home myself.""

I smile back, and wonder if this can all truly be a cynical ploy by a thief who has subjected me to military-grade hallucinogens.  I wonder, and in response, I ask myself for the hundredth time: what is the alternative?

And I still do not know.

I drive halfway to the hotel, then pull the Charger over to the side of the road and park.  I put my head on the steering wheel, and I breathe.

Eventually, I take Phil’s business card out of my pocket and I call the number.

\_\_\_

Less than ten minutes later, a dark gray work van screeches to a stop in front of me.  On its side are emblazoned the name of a dry-cleaning company, and a picture of a cheerful rooster holding up a pair of bloomers.  The rear doors burst open, and Phil gestures furiously from within.  I emerge from the Charger, envelope in hand, and climb into the back of the van.  The doors slam shut behind me.

Three other operators are here as well, all sharply dressed, all bending over screens or other specialized equipment.  One pushes a metal cart carrying a small copier into position, and Phil takes the envelope from my hand and places it flat on the top.  He nods at me.  ""Thanks for calling, son.  I know it wasn’t easy.  But you’re doing the right thing.""

As he talks, he runs a small pen-like device over the seal of the envelope.  Steam issues forth, and in short order Phil is opening the flap and drawing out Mr. Silvergleid’s carefully-written sheets.  Phil rifles through them, whistles in satisfaction.   ""Oh, yeah.  This is the stuff all right, son.  You did real good.""

It is dim in the van, and Phil is moving the papers around as he speaks, but I try as best I can to catch a glimpse of what is written upon them.  If the pages are truly full of military secrets, I wish to see this with my own eyes, and thus convince myself that I have done right.  As before, though, I can see only fragments:

*…crystal-capped skyscraper just north of the former city center –*

*…there are always BEAUTIES in the LIGHTHOUSE –*

*…there are always SHADOWS in the CORNERS –*

*…underwater facility –*

*…former Imperial Skyway –*

*…sunken Mectunimoth –*

I can make no sense of it.  And, despite my best efforts, I am not comforted.

Phil perceives this, perhaps, for he claps me on the shoulder as his compatriot runs the sheets through the copier and returns them to the envelope.  ""It’s all right, son,"" he says.  ""It’s all right.  The hard part is over.  Here.""  He takes from his pocket a fat roll of bills, presses them into my hand.

""For your trouble.  That’s as much as Silvergleid would have paid you in six months.  And you can keep what he gave you.""  The other operator has finished re-sealing the envelope, and Phil takes it from him and returns it to me.  ""Hold up one second,"" he says, and makes a call on his smartphone.  ""Special Agent?  It’s Phil… we got it all.  I mean the *full* deck.  The boys are transmitting now… yeah.  Yeah.  I’ll ask him.  Okay.""

He looks at me.  ""Is Silvergleid still at his office?""

I gulp.  ""I think so.  He said he was staying… I don’t know how long though.""

Phil nods crisply.  ""Think you can keep him there for another thirty minutes?  The Special Agent is talking to the judge now.  As soon as he’s got the warrant in hand they’re moving in.""  He sighs and looks off into the distance.  ""I’m afraid your boss is going away for a long time, son.  This stuff…""  He shakes his head, looks at his watch.  ""It goes down at midnight.  If you can hold him there.  Tell him there was a problem with the pickup.  Tell him, uh – ""

I grip the envelope tighter and try to stand straight.  ""I’ll tell him Saul didn’t say the passphrase.""

Phil clasps my shoulder again.  ""Good.  That’s good, son.  Thank you – for everything.""  He opens the van doors.  ""Get going.  I’ll see you after.""

I run back to the Charger, start the engine, peel out into the street.  It’s ten minutes back to the bakery.  I flip a quick U-turn across the center line, ignore the outraged honking, watch from the corner of my eye as the gray van tears away from the curb.  The Charger’s engine roars as I accelerate through the sporadic late-night traffic.

I glance at the clock on the dashboard.  It’s 11:35.  If I can get to Mr. Silvergleid in time – if I can keep him there for midnight – for the appointment at midnight –

My stomach drops.  I slam on the brakes, coming to a complete stop in the middle of the still-busy thoroughfare.  A car whips around the Charger, roars past with the blast of a horn, and as I sit the full horror settles over me.

I realize, at long last and surely very belatedly, what I have done.

*I have made an appointment for Mr. Silvergleid.*

One that now takes place in less than twenty-three minutes.

My hands shake, and I will them to stop.  There is still time.  I can still fix this.

""I must fix this,"" I say out loud.  And I know it is true.

I put the hammer down, and the Charger leaps forward into the driving rain.

\_\_\_

I scrape and bounce into the bakery’s parking lot a bare five minutes later, screech to a halt just outside the office and launch myself from the car.  As I scramble into the outer office I am already shouting: ""Mr. Silvergleid?  *Mr. Silvergleid!*  I’m so sorry – I made a mistake – you have to – ""

And I stop short, as Mrs. Silvergleid stares at me nonplussed from the visitor’s chair.  On my desk in front of her sits a plate of muffins.  She stands, her beautiful face creased with concern.  ""Nathan?  Whatever’s the matter?  You look like – ""

I wave my arms at her like a crazy person.  ""*I made an appointment!*""  I shout.  ""I didn’t mean – it doesn’t matter!  *We have to warn him!*""  I glance back at the outer door, expecting to see a SWAT team crashing through at any moment, but for now there is only the rain.

She breathes in through her nose and out through her mouth.  ""Okay.  It’s going to be okay, Nathan.  We’ll do it together.""  She glances at the inner door.  ""I’ll go first, all right?  He might take it better coming from me.""

This is my screw-up, and I should take the heat – but I am grateful for the support.  ""Okay,"" I say.  ""Thank you.""

""It’s my pleasure, Nathan,"" she says.  She turns, grasps the knob of the inner door, flings it open.  She strides through, and I am close behind.

""*TO YE OLIPHAUNT!*"" she shouts as she crosses the threshold.  ""*KEEPER OF* – oh!""

She stops, and I stop behind her.  For Mr. Silvergleid is not at his desk.

In his place sits the upper half of a department-store mannequin, clad in a fraying top-hat which superficially resembles Mr. Silvergleid’s.  The photo of Mrs. Silvergleid is gone from the desk, and in its place sits a single sheet of cream-colored paper covered in large block letters.

*YOU’RE BOTHERED*, it says.  The paper is turned so as to be easily readable by someone walking in the door as we just have.

Mrs. Silvergleid regards the scene, and she *hisses*.  She marches over and crumples the paper viciously in one hand –

And the room is filled with a sudden *BANG BANG BANG* as the rear door to the street, locked and bolted as it always is, judders in its frame against a series of brutal impacts.  With a final massive blow, the lock bursts from its moorings, and as the door swings open Phil charges through the gap.  His suit is immaculate as ever, and his eyes are blazing.

""*TO YE OLIPHAUNT!*"" he roars.  ""*KEEPER OF THE TUNNELS!  I OFFER THIS* – ""

He stops, stares, takes in the tableau.  His eyes fix on Mrs. Silvergleid, and in them I see only hate.  ""*You*!"" he spits.

Mrs. Silvergleid steps to the side, as if to keep both Phil and me in her field of vision, and her lip curls.  ""*You*,"" she says, and her voice drips with contempt.  Her resemblance to the kind woman who brought me muffins is growing slighter by the minute.  ""I should have *known*.  Did you really think – never mind.""  She shakes her head, smiles a poisonous smile.

""Here we stand,"" she tells Phil.  ""And here it begins.  We are *heard*.""  She raises her hand, points at the east wall.

A doorway has appeared where none was before: a battered wooden frame, yawning open to reveal a dark, cramped space filled with dusty crates.  It should not be there: behind that wall, I know, are the offices of the Vareigated Travel Agency, painted in bright appealing colors and festooned with pictures of sailboats.  What I look upon now is something else entirely.

""So we are,"" says Phil.  He drops into a fighting stance.  ""Let’s get you two acquainted.""

""Age before beauty,"" the former Mrs. Silvergleid replies.  Her hand darts into her coat pocket.

There is undoubtedly more, but I do not hear it.  I have, I think – at long last, and surely *very* belatedly – understood enough of the situation to plan and execute my next move.

It is, in brief, to step quietly back out of Mr. Silvergleid’s office and make my way to the front entrance.  As I pass through the door to the parking lot where the Charger awaits, the lights in the front office begin to flicker and dim.

I close the door behind me, and moments later I am roaring out of the parking lot.  In my hand is the second index card that Mr. Silvergleid gave me.

The one that tells me where to go when I’m bothered.

\_\_\_

Thirty minutes later, I am sitting at a secluded booth in one of the finest steakhouses in the city.  Across from me, Mr. Silvergleid sips from his wine-glass and then raises it in greeting as the maitre’d once again approaches us.

""Reginald,"" Mr. Silvergleid says.  ""Thanks again.  I’m sorry to put you to the trouble.""

Maitre’d Reginald bows and smiles slightly.  ""It is no trouble at all, Mr. Silvergleid.  Of course you must both stay with us tonight.  Charles is making up the West and South Rooms as we speak.  In the meantime, I do hope you enjoy your meal.""  He bows again and takes his leave.

Mr. Silvergleid squints at me.  ""You haven’t eaten much, kid.  You feeling all right?""  He sighs.  ""I mean, I know it’s been a day.  But you’re safe here.  And tomorrow you can go back home.  Really.""

I take a bite of steak to be polite.  It truly is excellent, and I am sorry I cannot enjoy it more.  ""I – um.""  I try to decide how best to formulate the question that has been weighing on me.  ""Am I fired, sir?""

For a moment, Mr. Silvergleid just goggles at me.  Then he throws his head back and laughs.  ""*Fired*?  Is that what’s eating you?""  He puts his glass aside and leans forward.

""You know the worst part of this gig, kid?  It’s trying to balance what I can tell people to keep them safe, and what’s gonna make them write me off as a nut.  Because if they write me off, they don’t take it serious, and someone gets hurt.""

He makes a brushing gesture.  ""You and me, we’re past all that.  You’ve seen behind the curtain, and you get it, and you *care*.  The job’s yours, kid.  To start with.  If you still want it.""

""I do, sir.""  I think for a moment.  ""Your wife was never really there, was she?""

He shakes his head.  ""My wife died fifteen years ago, kid.  I still miss her every day.""  He looks down for a moment, then brightens.  ""Listen, enough of that.  Tomorrow, we find a new office, and I tell you the score.  *All* of it.  And you decide how much you want to help.""

He beams and cuts into his steak.  ""Personally?  I’m guessing it’s gonna suit you right down to the ground.""

And do you know what, dear reader?  He is entirely right.

\_\_\_

This is, perhaps, a good time to wrap this tale up.  I am about to head out on a very special assignment for Mr. Silvergleid, and I do not yet know exactly when I will return.

In the meantime, I want to thank you for allowing me to get all of this off my chest.  It has been immensely helpful, and I want to close by recommending that you too find a trusted friend to unburden yourself to.  Give that person a call, and set a time to meet and talk through whatever is ailing you.

Your call should not, however, be to Mr. Silvergleid.  He is not available for appointments.",1,1744833384.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I got an offer then to join a government agency as a technical product manager - and I was super grateful to not be making coffee every day and waking up at 4am.

The new job was fine for the first year, but I realized it wasn't a good fit in the long run (especially when it comes to salary) and began applying elsewhere. That was in 2023. It is 2025 and I just got my latest rejection after 7 rounds of interviews.

I have lost count of the number of jobs I have applied to. If I've averaged about 2 per day, I've applied to at least 1,400. I've gotten referrals, done extra training and courses, volunteered, etc.

I have no savings. I have nothing in my retirement accounts any more - I emptied them to pay bills. I live with two roommates to save money and I'm not doing any vacations this year. I have some family I can ask for help for necessities, but it's embarrassing because I wanted to be the one helping my family by now.

Is something wrong with me? Honestly asking. I can't find any other explanation. My life feels like I'm in a combination of a bad dream and a rigged game show.",2,1744833124.0,jobs,3,0.75,False

Fellow home office workers - if you're still dealing with cable chaos, this might help. After a disastrous coffee spill caused by tangled cables during a client call, I tested 7 different cable management solutions for my home office.
The most surprising finding? The mental clarity from having an organized cable situation is genuinely valuable. I no longer waste time reconnecting cables that get pulled loose, and my cleaning routine is so much simpler.
For standing desk users, the cable spine was essential. For fixed desks, the under-desk tray made the biggest difference.
I documented everything with honest reviews (including what wasn't worth the money):

1k0tmzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k0tmzd/i_think_im_burntout/,I think Im burntout," Hello. Basically I am a high school student a sophmore and my workload is hectic. I know every high school student is dealing with a lot cause it takes WAY more to get into college in this day and age but I cant handle it. Its gotten to the point where my workload, extracurriculars, and how much I help around the house results in me getting around 20 hours of sleep weekly. I have had panic attacks because of it and Im trying to manage it. Right now I am on spring break and before it started I told my mom how excited I am to just sleep but she burst my bubble saying how we had to clean the whole week.

 My break started and monday i cleaned and went to SAT tutoring, tuesday did the same thing, today wednesday im cleaning and i have SAT tutoring thursday i have to go out for business friday i have a church event saturday i have church ALL DAY sunday i have classes and monday i also have to go out  for business and then im back to school Tuesday. Although I am getting more sleep than before It still irrtates me thsat at the single break Ive gotten till summer my scedule hasnt become any less hectic. In my family Im used to be the one who has to be ok because it was always easier for my parents growing up but now that im struggling im not feeling support just a lot more work and telling me to stop overeactinv and ill be fine.

 To stress how much I do on a day to day basis I wake up at 5 get to school sometimes i have softball other days I have Sat prep, volunteering, im writing a childrens book, I constantly study for my college classes especially Anatomy and Physiology, regular homework, then I have to help out around the house. All of this combined leads me pulling all nighters night after night just to get things done. 

After all this I still manage to mainain a 4.0. I remember i sometimes would do bad on a test due to the lack of sleep. I once started seeing dots during my test and eneded up with a 82. I had thrown up twice that day. Even  my classmates have told me that Im doing to much but I need to do it.  Now that Im on break I get mad anytime my mom asks me to clean and I get I should be helping but I cant help but feel my well deserved break is being taken from me. Any advice on how to stop being mad and just suck it up and maybe a substitute for coffee cause Im not allowed it to help me get through the rest of the school year

Context: hi guys! So share ko lang tong story. I met my boyfriend early 2024 and we’ve been dating na for 11 months. LDR kami since nandito ako sa Canada & siya naman nasa bulacan. Through online lang kami nagkakilala. So anyways, kinwento niya sakin na may ex siya 2023-ish pero 3 months lang tinagal. So nung una, hindi naman ako bothered kasi 3 months lang. only for me to find out na before that 3 month-relationship, meron siyang ex for 9 years and halos parang rebound niya lang sa girl na 3 months (classmate niya) 🙃 yung ex niya na 9 years. Childhood/HS sweetheart, first love, first gf, legal both sides basta first in everything. Syempre nung nalaman ko yun, feel ko bumagsak yung langit at lupa saaaaakin 😭 tas nung inistalk ko pa si girl. Maganda siya. As in maganda talaga. Mestisa type of beauty na pwede mong ipasok sa showbiz. Tapos close pa sa family ni boyfie lalo na sa mga ate. Even until now. Ang malala pa, maayos sila nag break up. Nagbreak lang sila kasi bumalik sa spain si girl. (I think spanish yung mom niya, i’m not sure anymore) 🙃 lahat na ata ng inggit sa katawan ko lumabas. How can i compete with that? Sobrang boto pa nga yung parents sakanya to the point na gusto sila ikasal noon. Anong laban ko doon? Ni hindi nga ako ma-flex sa social media 🙃 ang nahurt pa ako, kahit wala naman na sila communication ni boyfie, may connection pa din sa mga ate si girl 🙃 tipong nag coffee date pa sila nung umuwi yan si girl nung march dito sa pinas for vacation 🙃 madalas na kami mag away ni boyfie dahil nga panay selos ako. SINO BA DI MAGSESELOS SA GANON????? please lang, kung kayo nasa posisyon ko, normal ba magka retroactive jealousy??

1k0tlzk,https://v.redd.it/i944bchi39ve1,Help with drippy shots [Kitchen Aid Semi-Automatic Espresso Machine],"Hi Reddit! I'm having an issue with ""drippy"" shot pulls with my machine. I've decided to post here since Kitchen Aid customer service was nothing short of disappointing and useless.

I've had my machine for 2 years now and I've been using with the Kitchen Aid Burr Coffee Grinder. I've never changed anything from the default settings on either machine and have always pulled delightful shots (it's usually a double shot once or twice a day). The only thing to note is the puck has never been fully dry after a pull, but it never bothered me enough to do anything about it. I also regularly clean and descale the machine and use only filtered water.

A few weeks ago, I pulled about 3-double shots back-to-back while hosting some friends. I've pulled shots back-to-back before and never encountered any issues. After this, I noticed the quality of the pulls became very sloppy where the shot seems to pull fine for the first few seconds but then it chronically weekends and drips for the remainder of the pull (approx. 33 seconds). Because of this, I have to keep my mug in place longer until the dripping  stop. The taste of the shots are still fine, but I can tell something with the machine is off. I've included a video of this as well as the settings on my burr grinder.

I haven't had found myself having to drastically adjust the grind size and I've seemed to use consistent pressure when tamping, so I'm not sure why it's happening now. I've unscrewed and cleaned the mesh screen right above the portafilter insert in the machine, but that's about it. I know there can be quite a few variables at play here so I'm a bit cautious to proceed with playing around. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1,1744832946.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I’m quite lucky in the fact that I have clear skin, but lately it’s just lacking any glow or life to it. Dull and tired is how I’d describe it.

I will start adding healthy food back in but I really don’t know where to start with my skincare.

Enjoy a coffee in bed, maybe a little breakfast in bed too. Then get up, go for a hike (maybe have a drink and some at the pub along the way).  Head home, have a bath and a read, then sit in my back garden enjoying my surroundings and then when my partner came home from work, I'd have dinner ready, a bottle of wine for us to share and we'd be able to cuddle up and watch a film.

1k0tjed,https://i.redd.it/tw7rmla129ve1.png,A Day in the Bay - Reflections of Mechanic Team One,"# PERSONAL LOG — Reginald Tupperwell IV (""The Intern"")

**Date:** \[REDACTED\]  
**Location:** Ursus Maritimus Star Yard — Polar Outpost  
**Today’s Objective:**

* Do the mechanic thing.
* Avoid dying.
* Impress Tomo.

**0430 – Repair Bay 2**

Arrived early. Like, before-sunrise early. I had two alarms and a fear of being demoted to oxygen filter duty (again), so I sprinted here.

Found Hexnut head-first inside the Echelon’s coolant panel, or is that the stabilizer panel? Her legs were twitching, and she was muttering something like *“God help me I will hot-glue every utensil drawer in this hangar shut.”*  
I offered coffee. She growled. I interpreted that as “thank you.”

Mechanic’s Note: the bracket on the coffee pot seems to have stop the violent shaking it does while brewing. I call that a win!

>**REPAIR REPORT – FORM 17-B (MODIFIED)**  
**LOCATION:** Bay 2, Sub-Deck Maintenance Access  
**FILED BY:** Hyejin “Hexnut” Rao  
**UNIT:** UM-AF-77 “Echelon”  
**ISSUE:** Rear lateral stabilizer assembly – noncompliant oscillation

>**SUMMARY OF REPAIR:**  
Upon initial inspection, the stabilizer assembly exhibited a rhythmic vibration pattern inconsistent with standard flight calibration tolerances. Suspected hydraulic bleed or sensor drift. Opened panel, discovered that there was a *fork* in the stabilizer housing.  
A literal, four-pronged utensil, jammed between two servo cables like it belonged there.

>Scrawled on the inside of the inspection panel was a note in permanent marker:  
**“Do not remove. Jinx’s lucky fork. Flight-tested.”**

>This is *not* a recognized stabilization protocol under Ursus Maritimus engineering standards, and I cannot, in good conscience, calibrate a combat-rated star craft around the whims of flatware superstition. The fork has been relocated to my desk. Jinx may retrieve it after a formal safety briefing and a strongly worded conversation about boundaries.

>Adjustment completed. No further anomalies detected.

>–Hexnut

**0500 – Morning Briefing**

Boring as usual. Something about the coffee machine, but it wasn’t to praise my ingenuity. Tomo also confirmed that the floor scrubber is NOT voice-activated. I knew it! Stupid Flick and his stupid jokes.

Update: Tomo gave me a task! REAL work! I was handed a checklist and a crate labeled “Bounty Retrofit Kit – DO NOT MESS THIS UP.” It even had red tape. Red tape means *important.*

Personal Note: Whiteout was leaning against the wall drinking something that looked like soup and steam. They nodded at me. I nodded back. I think we’re friends now.

>**URSUS MARITIMUS INTERNAL MEMO**  
**FROM:** Tomasz “Tomo” Bell, Lead Mechanic  
**TO:** All Hangar Personnel  
**SUBJECT:** THE COFFEE INCIDENT

>To whichever genius decided to use the breakroom coffee unit as a test mount for the auxiliary coolant clamp:

>**You’re not funny.**  
I’ve gone ten rounds with a frozen grav-pump and still didn’t feel rage like this.

>**Coffee is not optional. Coffee is life support.**

>Whoever it was has 24 hours to confess, replace the unit, or receive a surprise “training opportunity” involving unpressurized cargo bays and the Heimdall waste tank.

>–Tomo  


**0600 – Landing Pad 4**

Retrofit time! I was in charge of:

* Fetching Parts
* Holding things
* Labeling things
* Checking things off the list
* Not getting in the way

Yay….

I went to the most prestigious technical school in the UC, and I’m basically a go-fer. I have a custom-made hand forged titanium multi-spanner, and Tomo won’t let me even touch it!

All because I dropped one (1) magnetic coupling bracket, and Crank caught it… with his foot. I’m pretty sure the metal it his boot caught it because he looked as surprised as I did. Crank quoted a haiku at me but I forgot it.

>**CRANK’S PERSONAL ENTRY**

>**FILED BY:** Mikhail ""Crank"" Tagore  
**TITLE:** This Kid’s Gonna Die But Maybe Not Today

>Intern dropped part. Foot caught it. Good reflexes today.  
Wrote a haiku while rerouting battery leads:

>*Tool slips. Sparks flying.*  
*Intern flinches. Catches breath.*  
*Luck is not a plan.*

>Quote of the hour: “Don’t look impressed. It encourages him.”

>—Crank

**0830 – Landing Pad 4**

I... may have accidentally installed the targeting module upside-down.  
Crank laughed so hard he nearly swallowed his gum. Hexnut said that might have made the ship auto-target *itself* if left unchecked. She fixed it. And said I had “a real future in organized sabotage.”  
That feels promising?  
Yana ran the scan. They whispered, *“The targeting system forgives you.”*  
I feel like I’m part of some strange priesthood now.  


>**YANA’S DIAGNOSTIC REFLECTION**

>**FILED BY:** Imani “Yana” Shō  
**TITLE:** The Ship Remembers

>The system flinched.  
It recognized betrayal in its wires.  
The intern pressed “align” as though begging the machine to forget.  
Tomo’s breath caught. Hexnut’s laughter vibrated against the hull.  
I found the misaligned circuit curled like a question. I spoke to it softly. It adjusted. Not for me—for the work.  
The ship forgave.  
Something important did *not* happen.  
That too has meaning.

>—Yana

**1200 – Mechanics Breakroom**

The client showed up. She’s like seven feet tall in body armor and has a scar that looks like a continent. Call sign “Halberd.” She’s terrifying.  
She walked straight up to me... ME... and asked, *“Is it ready?”*  
I panicked and said, “Absolutely,” even though we weren’t done at all.  
It. Was. Not.  
Tomo heard me as he walked in and did not blink for five whole seconds. Then said, “We’re on schedule.” And then turned and walked out.  
Everyone moved faster after that.  
I might be a ghost now.

**1245 – Landing Pad 4**

I used the wrong auxiliary power battery.  
It didn’t explode. That’s the good news.  
The ship blinked **“HELLO”** in binary for ten full minutes. That’s... less ideal.  
Tomo said it was *“a very polite malfunction.”*  
Halberd made a noise. It might have been a laugh.  
Might have been a death rattle.

**1305 – Landing Pad 4**

We’re done.  
I think.  
As the Test Pilot on duty, Whiteout, ran through preflight checks and then stepped out of the ship.  
He declared “the balance was off” and walked off.  
What the hell does that mean?  
Tomo shook his head and walked off to talk with Halberd.  
Everyone else just went back to work on something else leaving me alone with the ship.

**1320 – Observation Deck**

Crank triggered a fire alarm. I ran up to the Observation Deck with my fire extinguisher to help. Crank was yelling at the Test Pilots who were chanting around… something.  
Crank threw a wrench in the general direction of Whiteout and missed.  
I offered a protein bar as a peace gesture. Whiteout burned it and said, *“It has been accepted.”*  
And then I saw… it.  
I passed out. Again.  
I’ve decided this is part of the spiritual onboarding process.

>**INCIDENT REPORT – PAD OPS FORM 9-B**  
**FILED BY:** Mikhail “Crank” Tagore  
**LOCATION:** Observation Deck  
**TIME:** Every F\*ing Time with this Guy  
**CAUSE:** Whiteout and the Floating Trash Mammal

>**LOG:**  
Got called up to reroute the deck power. Saw smoke. Not *fire* smoke. Incense.  
Walked in on Whiteout kneeling in front of a dead raccoon wearing admiral’s bars.  
Yaz was holding a speaker. Sounded like rainfall and whale songs.  
Glass had goggles on and was throwing salt in a circle.

>No one looked surprised to see me. Whiteout just said,  
**“Balance requires symbols.”**  
And kept chanting.

>The Intern walked in at that point and offered up his snack bar for some reason.

>They lit a snack bar on fire. Called it “feeding the void.”  
I turned the power off and waited.

>Intern then fainted. Again.

>**RESULT:**  
No damage, unless you count my blood pressure.  
Wrote ‘em up. Again. Tomo’s locking the raccoon in supply with the bad parts bin.

>**NOTES:**  
I have no further comment.

>—Crank

**1410 – Landing Pad 4**

I woke up on a bunch of crates next to the ship. Whiteout was standing over me and smiling. It was creepy and reassuring at the same time.

Flick showed up yelling about cargo weights, live ammo, and “Why does this crate smell like regret and incense?” He shoved me at a crate and screamed “Get to LOADING Intern!”

I Moved.

>**FLICK’S CARGO LOG**

>**Filed by:** Del “Flick” Navarro  
**Title:** NO, I DID NOT APPROVE THAT

>Look—I’m just the loadmaster. You give me cargo, I strap it down. You give me upgrades, I balance weight profiles. You give me *three hours* to do a full weapon-swap on a bounty-hunter’s wet-dream of a ship and expect it to launch *on time*, I make it work.

>But I swear to every engine core in this galaxy— *one more person* hands me a “modified crate” full of live ammo and incense cones, I’m yeeting a manifest into the sun.

>Intern tried to help. Loaded it *wrong* and *enthusiastically*. Sweet kid. Accidentally loaded a crate labeled “NOT FOR USE – BIOWEAPONS DEPT” and now it’s somewhere in Halberd’s starboard bay.

>Kaia didn’t object. That means Kaia’s *watching.*

>Anyway. No one died. System’s intact. Client’s gone.  
Just another perfect day in hell.

>—Flick

**1640 – Observation Deck**

Halberd climbed in. Ship powered on.  
Everyone held their breath.  
Kaia released the launch protocol with zero objections. That never happens.  
It Lifted. Turned. *Did not self-target.*  
Halberd gave a thumbs up through the canopy. Her ship vanished into the sky like it knew the way home.  
Everyone exhaled like we’d just survived a goddamn exorcism.  
Why does it smell like a dead rodent in here?

**1800 – Post Flight De-Briefing**  
Tomo told us to update the checklist for future retrofits.  
I used extra highlighters.  
We’re also apparently no longer allowed to store incense in the mechanics bay. “Spiritual contaminants” are not covered under the warranty.  
Whiteout has been reassigned, and the bad parts bin has been marked “Off Limits”. No one will tell me why.  
Kaia has added a new quiet clause to my user profile titled **“Probationary Observance – Tier I.”**

>**SYSTEM ALERT: PROFILE UPDATE –** Reginald Tupperwell IV

>**CLASSIFICATION:** UM Internship  
**TAGGED TO:** Performance Profile – Internal Only  
**FILE LABEL:** Probationary Observance – Tier I

>**DESCRIPTION:**  
Subject Tupperwell has displayed a consistent pattern of unintentional operational disruption, counterbalanced by high enthusiasm, rapid compliance, and statistically significant survival outcomes.

>No direct threat to company assets, but trends suggest high probability of further procedural anomalies.

>**KAIA RECOMMENDS:**

>Maintain observational parameters.  
Limit access to high-voltage systems, senior clients, spiritual combustibles.  
Do not correct immediately unless harm is imminent—natural consequences appear effective.

>**ANNOTATION (non-actionable):**

>“There is a chaos that teaches. We will watch.”

>—KAIA  
*Silent integrity. Calculated mercy.*

**2200 - Final Thoughts**

I’m not sure if I helped.  
But the ship launched.  
And coffee is still broken.  
And Kaia is watching.

Just another day at the Landing Pad. I guess.

*P.S. : I think I’m getting good at this.*

>**URSUS MARITIMUS – INTERNAL BRIEF**

>**FROM:** Tomasz “Tomo” Bell, Lead Mechanic  
**TO:** Polar Division Ops, Engineering Oversight  
**SUBJECT:** Intern Review – Retrofit Rush Job / Bounty Hunter “Halberd”

>**SUMMARY:**  
Completed emergency retrofit on outbound client vessel—UM-compliant variant, heavily armed, high-profile registry. Assigned crew executed all deliverables under time pressure with no permanent damage to public image, station integrity, or client confidence.

>The intern, Reginald Tupperwell IV (“Renn”), was present for the duration. This is not a coincidence. It was the point.

>We’ve entered the “make-or-break” phase of intern integration. Performance today was not without issue—but chaos was the curriculum. The job demands technical fluency, yes. But it also demands survival instinct, adaptive improvisation, and the ability to hold a plasma wrench while someone chants over a raccoon.

>Reggie displays the expected symptoms of greenfield assignment: panic, overcompliance, chronic over-apologizing, and the compulsion to label everything with highlighters. But he’s starting to gel. He’s no longer afraid of Crank (a bad sign, but also progress).

>He listens. He bounces back. And he hasn’t tried to “digitally enhance” my wrench set again, so I’m calling that measurable growth.

>**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

>Intern to remain under continue structured exposure to controlled mechanical chaos. No further client contact permissions without explicit sign-off.

>**FINAL NOTE:**  
While the intern's performance was chaotic by the numbers, intention remains aligned. They’re learning. Slowly. Loudly.  
Reggie isn’t ready. But neither was anyone else when they started.  
We'll keep 'em. For now.

>—**Tomo**

If you’ve ever walked into a room and forgotten why you’re there, welcome to the club. If that’s happening five times a day and your concentration's shot — we need to talk.

Brain fog can make you feel slow, unfocused, and frustrated. It affects your work, your sleep, and your ability to remember why you opened the fridge in the first place.

Some say it’s **stress**, others blame **poor sleep**. But what if it’s deeper than that? Could the real culprit be **microbial toxins** and **heavy metals affecting memory**?

Let’s talk about [Fast Brain Booster](https://theworldhealth.org/fast-brain-booster-official), a supplement that’s stirring up curiosity for claiming to clean out your brain — like a spring-cleaning for your thoughts.

# 📦 Product Overview

* **Product Name**: Fast Brain Booster
* **Category**: Wellness ➝ Brain Health Supplements
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.7/5

# 🧬 What Is Fast Brain Booster?

**Fast Brain Booster** is a **natural brain detox supplement** formulated to reduce fog, improve memory, and restore focus. But here’s where it gets interesting.

Unlike other pills that flood your system with caffeine, this one works by flushing out **toxins** — especially **heavy metals in the brain** causing **symptoms** like confusion and forgetfulness.

The makers believe **memory loss caused by brain toxins** is a major issue and that addressing **early signs of brain toxin overload** is the first step to mental clarity.

It’s made for people who feel mentally “off” and want a fix without stimulants or chemicals — just clean support from **plant-based brain supplements**.

# 🧠 How Does It Work?

The idea behind **Fast Brain Booster** is pretty simple. It targets **toxic brain buildup** by encouraging your body to **remove brain toxins naturally**.

By doing that, it claims to free up your brain’s “bandwidth” — improving memory, mood, and processing speed. No system overload, no jitters.

The key is balance. Instead of masking symptoms, it helps **cleanse your brain for better focus** and sharper thinking using **natural remedies for brain fog**.

For those wondering **how to flush heavy metals from the brain**, this might be the option worth trying before you resort to internet rabbit holes and conspiracy blogs.

# 🌿 Key Ingredients and Their Roles

The **Fast Brain Booster ingredients list** includes [14 natural compounds](https://theworldhealth.org/fast-brain-booster-official), all chosen for their brain-supporting effects and detox abilities.

* **Ginkgo Biloba Leaf**: Used to support blood flow and help combat **symptoms of toxic brain buildup**.
* **Bacopa Monnieri**: One of the oldest **herbs that help with mental focus** and stress adaptation.
* **Alpha-GPC**: Provides choline for memory, ideal for those seeking **natural ways to restore mental clarity**.
* **Huperzine A**: Preserves key neurotransmitters for better focus and short-term recall.
* **St. John’s Wort**: Often used in **natural remedies for brain fog**, especially where mood is involved.
* **Lecithin**: Delivers phospholipids to protect brain cells from damage.

Each of these contributes to improving **mental clarity**, especially in people looking for **how to improve brain clarity naturally** without synthetic formulas.

# 🧪 Real Experience With Fast Brain Booster (via Leo, my sister’s old college friend)

Leo’s a middle school history teacher who’s been in the game for over a decade.

We caught up at a dinner party my sister hosted — the kind where you end up talking about everything from ancient Mesopotamia to meal prepping.

Leo casually mentioned how hard it’s been keeping up with lesson planning and grading papers lately. “I used to memorize student names in a day,” he said. “Now I blank on my own login sometimes.”

He’d been trying to power through the fog with coffee and sheer willpower, but neither was cutting it.

A mutual friend had told him about [Fast Brain Booster](https://theworldhealth.org/fast-brain-booster-official), and after some initial skepticism (and reading too many **brain detox supplement reviews** at 1 a.m.), he gave it a shot.

Leo told me the shift was gradual, not dramatic. Around week three, he said things started clicking again — fewer mid-sentence pauses, less re-reading, and more fluid recall during lectures.

What impressed him most was how it didn’t come with a jittery edge like some **supplements that flush out brain toxins**.

The only downside? The capsules smell like a dried salad. But as he put it, “If that’s the tax for feeling like myself again, I’ll pay it.”

She told us to give her a nickname, and then she suggested we call her “mom”, mind you our mom is very much alive and we have an amazing relationship with her. 
She then complained to us that when we visit them we seem to only want to spend time with our dad, more than we do with her (they live in a different country). 
Last night we went to get some coffee and she began to complain that we never want to be with her, and that we don’t love her even though we are her children (her words)
I told her we that we do love her, but she isn’t and will never be our mom.

Now she isn’t speaking to me and is sulking around the house and I’m wondering if I went too far.

1k0tfv8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0tfv8,Making east facing home warm and cozy,"
We have a two story town home that mostly gets natural light from the east (home faces directly east and west wall is shared wall with neighbors). Our stairwell has sky lights.

We’re tired of the “agreeable grey” in the shared living spaces of the home and want to replace it with something warm and cozy (think cottagecore vibes). Our first floor is an open concept living room and kitchen with bay windows (sorry about the giant drawers behind the couch), and then we want to paint the stairwell too. 

On the walls, you can see some of the colors I’ve been playing with (4 total). 

Basically, we’ve noticed the colors change a lot throughout the day! And it’s giving us commitment issues.

My questions for you all:

1. We really like the darkest yellow one (warm marshmallow by behr), but does yellow play nicely with shadows and cooler light? 

I feel like we get a lot of that in the afternoon/evening. Most of the time when we look at the samples we like it, but then some parts of the day it feels dark and tinted differently and we second guess.

2. Would it be better to rely on accessories to bring in warmth, instead of paint color? (Curtains, plants, frames, etc)

I used Swiss coffee by behr as one of the four samples. It’s a “warm white” but I feel like it gets so washed out and sterile in the afternoon. But maybe with the right accessories more of its warmth would come out? I’m considering it because it seems like a really safe option.

I randomly got CU when I was home from college because of COVID. I was unable to workout or eat spicy food without being in severe discomfort. Won’t spend too much time here since I think everyone here knows what it is like.

I went through MONTHs of appointments trying to figure out what was wrong. The frustrating part was i felt like i was being gaslit into thinking it was COVID or anxiety related.

My solution came from this: i had started drinking coffee when I went home from college (previously a redbull fan :)). Every so often, i like to do a detox from caffeine to reset my tolerance and improve my natural energy. So, after months of being home, drinking, coffee, and suffering, my first sign of relief came from when I was doing a routine caffeine tolerance break and stopped drinking coffee. The week i stopped, i noticed my CU went away. Huh, I thought, so i tried coffee again and then it came back. Tried this a few more times and eventually came to the conclusion that coffee was giving me these issues.

I’m fully aware this kind of solution will not work for everyone. I was lucky to just have to stop drinking coffee for it to go away. But, i guess if i had one piece of advice it would be to try cutting out random foods and see how it impacts you. CU mimics allergic reactions in many ways with how your body reacts, so there may be some correlation. I was never severely allergic to coffee considering i drank it for many months, but it was overall giving my this issue.

1k0t8k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1k0t8k9/how_i_just_got_covid_for_the_first_time_even/,How I just got COVID for the first time even though I was trying to be careful (P100 wasn't enough),"On the spectrum on how risk avoidant you are and what steps you take to avoid being infected, I would say I'm pretty far on the cautious side.  For example, I've been working remotely as a software engineer for all 5 years of the pandemic now even though I hate it and would be much happier going into the office.  I avoid going into indoor public spaces when I can.  I'm very rarely around others without an N95 on in outdoor situations and in indoor public spaces I wear my P100 elastomeric respirator, and have tried to stay educated about COVID the best I can.

Last month, I attended an indoor stand-up comedy show in Los Angeles and immediately afterwards got my first known COVID infection.  It's only the 2nd time in 5 years that I've put myself in a high risk situation, and it got me.  I'd hoped that I was taking enough preventative steps to lower the risk, but it wasn't enough, and I wanted to share my experience in case anyone else finds it informative.

# Steps I Took To Prevent Infection

1. Got a Novavax booster 12 days before the event
2. Wore my 3M 7502 elastomeric respirator with 3M 2291 P100 particulate filters, donning it before approaching the event and did not take it off the entire time.  Since the last time I cleaned and reassembled the respirator, I performed qualitative fit testing with it at home using Bitrex and the cheap nebulizers you find on Amazon roughly following [philipn's instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Masks4All/comments/w92jng/why_a_diy_fit_test_should_be_your_next_step_after/).  During the qualitative fit testing, it performs about as well as my other elastomeric respirator, the MSA Advantage 900, and much better than a 3M Aura or VFlex disposable N95 respirator.  Because the filters are floppy material, I can't block the inhalation completely to test the respirator every time I don it, but I block the exhalation and breath out to try and test the seal on my face the best I can (I want to be clear these are not the recommended instructions for how to check the respirator, but it's what I do because it's what I can do).
3. Directly after the show, I took a shower, trying to keep my eyes closed until after I'd washed my hair and face so the water wouldn't run virus into my eyes.
4. I left my clothes I wore to the event in the bathroom, not in the rest of the studio apartment that I spent 24/7 in.
5. Community wastewater levels were in the vicinity of other historical ""lows"" (relatively speaking).  This is the data from [https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/:](https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/:)

https://preview.redd.it/ga985qe5v8ve1.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a76f89f1ab13a741eb7f8199a3fc8be2407ef90

# The Circumstances of Exposure

I think it's most likely I was infected at the stand-up show since in the surrounding week no other possible explanation of exposure seems nearly as likely -- I only had minimal, masked exposure to others typical of what I've been doing for 5 years.

1. It was an intimate indie venue in the back room of a coffee shop, probably could fit 50-80 people.
2. I was there for about 1.5 hrs.
3. Given that it was a stand-up show, everyone was laughing constantly, which is much worse for putting more virus in the air than if people were sitting quietly.  I know this was about the highest possible risk situation.
4. The audience was arranged in a U shape around the small stage, 3-4 rows deep all around.  I sat in the rightmost seat in the venue on the edge of the audience to minimize the number of people I was close to.  No one was in the seats directly adjacent to me.  A couple both wearing KN95s were two rows ahead of me on my level, about 3.5-4 ft away.  The next closest people were two to my left on risers higher than me, about 4-5' feet away, and then the rest of the audience continued on behind them.  I wonder if the couple wearing the KN95s were infectious and thought it was okay to come to the show anyway as long as they were masked.  If so, then they would have been a double source of virus, even though their KN95s and my P100 would have cut down the number of virus particles considerably.

# Factors Increasing My Risk of Infection

1. In general, I was not eating or sleeping well, and my understanding is that poor sleep can impair your immune system.  For 1-2 days before and after my vaccination, and before and after the stand-up show, I made a focused effort to eat and sleep better, but outside of that I wasn't great.  In particular, the nights that were 48 hours and 72 hours after the event were very notable in poor sleep and general lack of well-being -- only got to sleep after 2am because of poor food choices during the day, 5+ hrs total of poor quality sleep, dragging and not feeling well the next morning.
2. To my knowledge, I haven't had a previous infection and acquired immunity that way, only vaccine boosters.

# Illness Progression

My intended goal of this post was to focus on the circumstances of getting infected, not the period of illness, so I won't go into detail here, but happy to provide detail if people are interested in symptoms or steps I took to treat.

TL;DR: Very mild.  Fatigue.  Persistent sore/achy back of head/nape of neck, which is a symptom that I've now found correlates consistently with COVID exposure for me (I had a known masked exposure in 2023 for 1 minute that did result in the sore neck feeling, but didn't become a systemic infection per PCR test).  No respiratory symptoms except for about a 2 hour window the day after my last Paxlovid dose.

Tested with QuickVue rapid tests with the long swab, sampling the cheeks, tonsils, back of throat, and lots of swapping way back in the nasopharynx, and across the course of the illness the resulting line varied from ""so faint you might miss it if you weren't looking for it"" to ""faint but noticeable"", but never became pronounced.

# Takeaways

For me personally, if I were to go back in time and had the opportunity to make another decision, I would not have gone to the event, even though it was something I was really excited about and thought I had lucked out with an event I really cared about aligning with a period of lower community transmission via wastewater metrics.  It wasn't worth getting infected for (maybe) the first time.  It sucks that I took me doing something risky for only the 2nd time in 5 years and that was enough for it to get me, but that's reality.  I felt okay about everything I was doing to lower risk but it wasn't enough.

I think my biggest lesson learned is that if I'm not sleeping well and my general well-being is off (not ill but just not feeling great in general), then I should be extra cautious and cannot afford to take risks.  I do wonder if that ended up being the most important factor in my case.",28,1744832008.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,8,0.97,False

For context, I'm in the 5th year of my bachelor, and I also work halt-time. We both met in high-school in our hometown. But she moved to a small (bigger than our hometown) city, and I moved to the biggest city in the country. She lives in an apartment with her boyfriend, and they both have a coffee shop.

The text states the following (It was written in spanish and translated in the internet):

*""Hello, hey I wanted to tell you something, well several things. I thought about it a lot because I didn't know how to handle it but I think it's already affecting me a lot more than I thought it would and it's keeping me from going about my day and I have a lot of things to do.*

*I am very upset with you since you arrived, it bothers me a lot that you couldn't bring your stuff and you will end up using my toothbrush, Bryan's towel, that I have to pay you for everything and you don't help at all and you have all your stuff thrown away or you can't even fold your blanket in the morning because the last thing I want is to get home and see everything thrown away.* 

*You went overboard on Saturday at the Cool Store fighting with Juan, he is a friend of my friends and also people I work with and I had to go before the next day to apologize to them because I felt so sorry for them and I thought they wouldn't even want to do the event, you know, and it's really unfair that something I planned with a lot of love went wrong because of your attitudes and the one who should have apologized is you, not me to fix your shit.*

*It's a mega heavy week and you didn't even ask me or Bryan if it was ok to stay so many days and I don't think it's even physically, mentally and economically feasible for me to sustain you to stay more. I don't even need to mention all the fuss you caused by staying Saturday at the Disco.*

*Bryan is also tired and nefarious and all he wants is to be able to be left alone in his house and his stuff and maybe if I lived alone I would put up with it. But I live with him and if he is just as uncomfortable I don't want to keep putting him through this. It makes me very upset because obviously all these days I have been sad thinking that I am not going to see you the same way anymore, but I really just want to get home calmly to be able to rest and not be thinking about what to make you to eat.*

*You sucked the other day asking for a bunch of things at the cafe, you order matcha with oat milk the most expensive drink on the menu along with three other drinks and you still suck a cookie but you are not able to wash the dishes without me asking you to do it.*

*I'm really angry and I thought you had much cleaner, nicer habits and behaviors and that I wouldn't have to struggle with the fact that you take a bath and leave everything wet and I have to clean up after you. I am really angry and upset and I don't want you to stay in my house anymore. I don't want to talk to you and I don't know if I want to maintain a friendship with you.*

*Today I am not coming to my house so you can pack your things and leave, just please let Bryan know what time you are leaving so he can go open the door for you because if you really want to do something for me it is not to make me see you, I have a lot of things to do today and I don't want to deal with this, maybe in the future but not right now. I ask you please that the best thing you can do for us right now is just to let us know what time you are leaving so we can organize our day because we have a lot of things to do today and the rest of the week. I also thank you for the good things but I don't want to keep feeling this way because in the end it is my house and since Saturday when you fought with Juan I should have sent you away because of the shame and embarrassment of your behavior. Be that as it may it was not the place or way and much less if you go to an event that cost money and I paid you know, the least you could do was not to behave like that with someone. I'm going to block you because I really don't feel like talking, let Bryan know what time you're leaving, I have a lot of things to do.""*

I´m placing an envelope with my expenses and an apology letter. But I also want you to see it from my side. I arrived on friday, planning to stay until next friday. They seemed to have no problem with it, but little did I know this would be one of their busiest weeks. My first mistake was not bringing a toothbrush and a towel. Last week was very busy for me, I had to catch up on a lot of work so I could come here. And I forgot to bring a toothbrush and a towel, that's true. But keep in mind on the first day I offered to go to a pharmacy and buy them myself. But my friend told me not to worry and gave me a toothbrush and towel. Turns out they only had two towels, one for each. And it was her boyfriends towel. I never knew that until I got the text. If I knew that, I would have insisted in buying my own or even using a t shirt. Thinking about it makes it disgusting even for me. And I understand that if some asshole used my boyfriends towel for four days I would be mad too.

  
On saturday I joined them at the coffee to do some remote work in the morning. Keep in mind I always offered to pay for my stuff, and they always declined. Later we had an event at a vinyl shop called the Cool Store. There, I encountered a guy from the city I live in (named Juan, M40s) and we engaged in banter. My city is like NY-NJ, so people often talk to each other harshly. It wasn't even a deep discussion, we discussed South Park, our city and other stupid stuff. But the city my friend lives in has extremely polite people, so it could have seemed like a vicious discussion. It was a paid event, that I had offered to pay too, but she declined.

Later that day, two of her friends and coworkers invited us to go clubbing. My friend and her boyfriend were too tired, but told me I could go if I wanted. Her BF told me to send him a text once I arrived home. We stayed there until 1AM. I was outside the apartment, texted him but he didn't respond. I texted one of the people who attended, asking if I could stay in their couch. They said yes and I went there. About two hours later they call me and tell me they are on their way. I say it's no big deal, I already got a place to stay. They go get me regardless.

The day after, she tells me it was terrible of me to join them, because I came to town to visit them, not their friends. I agreed because I felt very bad. Keep in mind that their relationship with these two other people was falling apart and I didn't know. So, spending the night with the people they had beef with wasn't a great idea. I just noticed they got blocked as well. Later on Sunday we attended the same vinyl store, I was invited to give some sort of informal conference on a niche topic and we went to get burgers later.  Nothing eventful happened that day.

On Monday I joined them all day to do some remote work at their coffee shop. That's the day I ordered for some expensive shit. But keep in mind they declined me paying again. I offered to pay for myself on every occasion, when we went grocery shopping, at their cafe, and they declined. They had to stay late while I did some cleaning around the house. When they arrived, she (my friend) told me it was inconsiderate of me to order such expensive things. I again offered to pay, make them a transaction, anything, but she refused.

Then, yesterday I had to stay home because of some muscular pain. So I got some rest and tidied up the flat, ran some errands, bought some groceries, put some clothes on the washing machine. I'm very hurt that she feels like I didn't do enough around the house. I do admit to leaving the bathroom wet because my boss phoned me and I was in a hurry.

I am truly devastated. I want to say sorry, but make her see my point of view. If I had known that it would be such a busy week, I wouldn't have come at such an inconvenient time. I really never wanted to be a burden o them. But they never told me. This is not the first time it happens, two years ago she went no contact with me for several months because I took too long to congratulate her on she publishing a book. It was terrible of me, but it also was my finals week, I could barely sleep, let alone reach out to her. She is like a sister to me and losing her like this feels terrible.

TL;DR: My best friend (27F) went no contact with me (23M) and kicked me out of her house after a terrible thing that involved a lot of misunderstanding. Is there anything I can do to make things better? ",1,1744831667.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

For nearly a decade, I've been deeply passionate about working as a business consultant for SMEs. I genuinely love diving into different businesses, understanding their challenges, and helping them unlock their potential for growth, learning, and overall improvement. There's nothing quite like seeing a small business thrive!

However, the pressure of working within a consulting firm is starting to wear on me, and the entrepreneurial itch to go solo is getting stronger every day. (Yes, the ""just quit and open a coffee shop"" thought pops up regularly, but let's be honest, I'd probably be plotting its expansion strategy within six months!).

My real passion lies in helping small business owners improve their key metrics and achieve their goals. The challenge I'm grappling with, especially in the current economic climate, is that many of these businesses simply can't afford traditional consulting fees.

This leads me to a question that's been brewing in my mind: Does anyone here have direct experience in buying struggling small businesses/SMEs, implementing turnaround strategies, and then selling them for a profit?

Any insights, personal anecdotes, or even resources you could point me towards would be hugely appreciated. I'm eager to learn from those who have walked this path.

If you don't have a Costco membership, they can be ordered on Amazon as well, but I think a 6-pack is 35 on Amazon.

Power Description:

The Kōhī Kōhī no Mi grants the user the utterly mundane ability to generate any type of coffee from their body. Espresso, latte, cappuccino, iced coffee, decaf—you name it, they can produce it… directly from their hands, mouth, or even pores.

The flavor and temperature are always perfect, and the user can customize blends, sweetness, milk, and foam levels with a thought. But beyond that? Completely useless in combat.

Abilities:

Endless Coffee Supply: Never run out of caffeine again.

Barista Mode: User can summon coffee art on command.

Mood Brew: The coffee slightly adjusts to the user’s current emotional state (e.g., bitter when sad, sweet when happy).

Aromatic Aura: Always smells like a fresh café.

Weaknesses:

Zero Combat Utility: The coffee does nothing special—just tastes amazing.

No Buffs: No speed boosts, no energy surges. It’s just coffee.

Sticky Mess: In battle, spraying coffee usually just makes everything slippery and annoying.

Annoying for Allies: Imagine having to dodge lattes during a fight.

I THINK I like the full body roasts. 

We visited Cuba recently and not having access to sugar during some of the trip I started preferring it that way. 

Recently acquired a V1 Silvia, replaced the head gasket and back flushed and descaled.

Bought the ESP and a scale and spent a lot of time on here learning.

Purchased a full body roast today. They claimed the beans were roasted less than 72 hrs ago (and if what I read was correct, they need to age for a couple more days before reaching optimal peak).
Used them anyway to test out the grinder and got it dialed in. The result was visually beautiful and tasted pretty decent.

If I were to purchase a medium roast, what can I expect?  More flavor?  What I read I’ll need to adjust my grind to finer due to the medium roast, correct? 

Basically what  am I doing, taking my pallet from PBR to more of a micro brew and I’ll just need to play with roasts and bean regions to know what I truly like?

My main gripe was that every episode was just so predictable. I feel bad because I basically spoiled two episodes on accident while watching with my girlfriend. The writing/plot overall just seemed to be really weak for most of the episodes.

  
Common People - >!as soon as the premise was revealed I said ""oh they are gonna jack up the subscription fee and its gonna make it impossible to the point where he has to kill her"". Well the episode goes on and thats exactly what happened. Maybe it was so predictable because that's what Netflix has been doing with their subscription prices, the irony lol....!<

USS Callister - >!As soon as Walton (the CEO) went into the world after it was revealed his clone was alive, I said ""I bet he is gonna kill his clone and try to take his place""... and of course Walton's clone goes and shaves his beard and cuts his hair to look EXACTLY like his outside counterpart even after knowing he was trying to kill the entire crew. At that point it was painfully obvious!<

Hotel Reverie - >!I just really REALLY disliked this episode... so many plot holes. The comedy was so forced, every character was overacting. Once the guy spilt the coffee on his PC (..very predictable) the celebrity actress's life is in danger, and they are still concerned about the time constraint regarding the people coming in to film a toilet paper commercial??? Idk, if I were a studio owner and I had the choice of: A) canceling or rescheduling the toilet paper commercial or B) possibly having the death of a popular celebrity actress be on my hands... I would probably prioritize saving the actress's life and not gaf about a toilet paper commercial rn. They  also said that it was ""6-7 hours every second"" so every minute that goes by was supposed to be 2 1/2 weeks? Being generous and saying they may have fixed the issue in 10 minutes in real time (seemed like it was longer but wtv) they would have been stuck there for 25ish weeks, basically half a year. And when they fix it they just reset without checking in on the lead actress to see what her mental state even is?  The one part I did enjoy was when the AI actress breached the construct and learned about herself, which made her falling in love with Issa Rae's character make a lot of sense - BUT THEN THEY JUST WIPE HER IMMEDIATLEY AFTER SO IT DIDN'T EVEN MATTER LIKE-???? This episode is pretty much tied with the Hannah Montana episode for worst episode of all time imo.!<

Bete Noire - >!This episode was decent, but again just super predictable. When it was revealed the blond girl was a computer geek, I thought to myself that it would be something to do with simulation theory and she was changing the simulation using that pendant... I don't think I ended up being too far off.!<

Eulogy ->!This episode was overall really good, however, I did think ""oh I bet that this guide is actually her (the woman who died). Ended up being her daughter, but still wasn't really a super surprising twist. I don't really have much else to gripe about with this episode. I think Eulogy and Plaything were by far the strongest episodes this season!<

I’m looking for some advice as a young (23F) graphic designer. Lately, I’ve been feeling super stressed about my future. I’m about to graduate with my bachelor’s in graphic design, and while I started school hopeful that I’d find a fun, fulfilling career in the industry, my outlook has become a lot more pessimistic recently.

Design jobs just feel so hard to come by right now, and the ones I do find tend to raise red flags (super low pay, long hours, unrealistic expectations, etc). It’s been really draining.

That said, I recently got an unexpected opportunity through one of my regulars at the coffee shop where I work. He’s super sweet and is high up at a company in the area, and he had me come in for an interview. The position isn’t fully graphic design-focused. I’d be doing some design work (like the annual report, social media content, and maybe a few ads), but most of it would be admin-related.

It’s not the most exciting role, but it comes with a livable wage, normal hours, benefits, and overall stability which, as a recent grad, is hard to ignore. Still, I’m having an internal conflict. On one hand, it’s a solid offer, and turning it down in this job market feels risky. On the other, it’s not really the kind of job I envisioned when I chose this career path.

I’ve done two design internships during college, so I like to think I’m ahead of the curve but the more I read on this subreddit, the more doubtful I feel about finding a “dream” design job any time soon.

So I built a little tool that calculates your **personal caffeine cutoff time** based on your bedtime, sensitivity, and any drinks you’ve had earlier in the day.

* Add multiple drinks (they stack)
* Turn on a stricter “Sleep Priority” mode
* Visualize how caffeine decays in your system over time

1k0sxqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1k0sxqd/disney_done_wrong/,Disney done wrong,"I’m going to first apologize because this story will be long because I don’t know how to make short stories.

I’ve basically just lost a friend because our trip to Disney didn’t go as she wanted. Let me explain.

I live no where near Disney. She lives right next to it.
I have never been to Disney and always wanted to go. She goes literally all the time and gets in for free because her family has worked there for 30 years. All she has to do is pay for like food n whatever she buys in the park.

We met at work, established a pretty close bond from the various work trauma (as you do) but also we had a lot in common as well. I was there for her through her struggles with her long time boyfriend, and for their inevitable break up, and she was there for me for my various rants and rambles about all my health issues I constantly face.

She made a trip up to visit me, but also her uncle who lived about an hour away. We got to meet in person the first time and she got to see physically how I am. I’m a pretty chill person who just vibes mostly. I don’t really make plans. If you wanna do stuff, I’m down just let me know. I’ll suggest stuff but if you don’t wanna, that’s cool too. That’s just how I roll. I often am physically too ill to do a lot for one reason or another due to chronic stuff, so this is just how I am. We had a fun time while she was up here, so we then began to plan my trip down to FL to visit her and go to Disney.

Now, a very important thing we need to discuss is how I was also kinda seeing/FWB with another one of our coworkers. I have the FULL story in r/stories if you want to read it, but basically the tldr of that is… I wanted to just be friends, he wanted to be more, I gave into this but things became confusing because he kept making rules and boundaries that I would follow but he wouldn’t. One moment we’re cool, next we aren’t. One moment he’s telling me we’re normal fwb, next he’s saying he’s in love with me. Like the amount of whiplash I got from this person was ridiculous and slowly started to take a toll on me. Again, all I wanted was friendship and the more he manipulated me, the more attached I ended up becoming due to a dopamine addiction from his love bombing. It was very unhealthy, everyone around me saw it, warned me (including the friend of topic) but I had rose colored drug addicted glasses on. I let this dude just keep sapping me dry, until I had become an anxious mess. Eventually, even I realized I couldn’t continue like this and tried to talk things out with him but it didn’t work, and I had to end our friendship completely.

Now, why was that story important? Because my trip to FL was mainly to visit Disney with my good buddy, it was also in visit they asshat too for like an afternoon. While that visit to him was a small part of the trip, it was HUGE to me for obvious reasons. I had warned my friend while shit was getting bad with him that if he blows off our meeting (which was possible) it would devastate me and she’d have to see me crumble. She suggested I just not meet him then it just, better yet, stop fucking talking to him cuz he was a piece of shit. I warned her still that even if I DID do this (which I did, in the end), it would allow me sometime to heal but ultimately this trip is still partially tied to him so it’s still gonna effect me a bit.

Continuing on, like I said, I ended things with him 4 days before my trip to FL. That’s not a lot of days to heal. Not at all. I was a mess, tbh. No one expected me to do this but I knew I had to for my own health because things were just getting really bad for me. My friend knew this, as well.

My first few days in FL were fun. I spent time at her house, met her family, we ate at a few good places she suggested, took a small hike around a beach area and it honestly made me feel good. Even on the day I was supposed to meet him, honestly I didn’t feel sad at all. I was super surprised by this and felt it was a really good sign! We just enjoyed our time and hung out.

Friday and Saturday were the two days we were supposed to spend at Disney. We packed our stuff since she got us a place at a resort there (she did pay for this, and I was very appreciative since it was close to the parks and the airport, so less transport time), and we were off. Thing was… on our way there, I got an email from UPS saying I was getting a package. I didn’t think much of it since I get packages all the time from like Amazon n stuff but it said the sender was “The UPS Store” and I was like wtf? My friend said this meant someone was sending me something personally, it wasn’t from like a seller. This made my blood turn cold. I knew exactly who was sending me something and why. The fwb guy had something of mine, a Lego set, which I had requested multiple times he just mail me but he wouldn’t. He kept using it as bait since “I was coming to FL anyway” he could just give it to me in person. Well, since I wasn’t meeting him now, now he was finally mailing it. You’d think I would be happy he was finally mailing it… but for some reason, I wasn’t. Maybe it was because just the day before I had made peace with everything? I really don’t know but I started to have a full blown anxiety attack.

My friend got confused. She didn’t understand. “I thought you wanted the set?” She asked.
I did. Very much so. It was mine and it was sent to him by accident. 
“So why are you freaking out?”
Again, I didn’t know. All I knew, was… I was. My insides churned and I wanted to vomit, cry, shit, die, everything. 
I told her that I had a few theories on why I was feeling this way, mainly that I had just made peace with everything, I had just sent him my “goodbye novel” the day before also, and now he was sending me something so it’s like it took my peace and my resolve and threw it out the window. Again, this doesn’t have to make sense but this was the theory I was going with at the moment, but the only way I could positively identify what EXACTLY was making me flip out, was by talking things out, bouncing ideas off, and work shopping this.

No. She didn’t want to do this. She looked at me and said “We’re on our way to Disney, though. Just try to focus on that.”

“But-“

“But Disney, though.”

And that was the end of that during the car ride.

We got to the resort, checked in, and waited for our room to be ready at one of the bars. I got a drink because I needed to relax. Once again, I tried to talk to her so I could calm down. This time, she just looked annoyed and was like “uh huh” the more I went on. I didn’t feel like I should go on when it was obvious she didn’t want to listen, so I gave up. Our food came, we ate then brought our stuff to the room.

I would also like to point out that due to our beach walk the day prior, for some reason, I had a bunch of blisters on my toes? I don’t know why. The walk was easy, these shoes have been worn a billion times… like I really don’t know why my toes decided blisters would be a cute addition but they did. She gave me some bandaids so I could put them on before we ventured out. It wasn’t great but it made my feet hurt a little bit less but was pretty uncomfortable still. This comes back later, which is why I’m mentioning it now. We unpack our stuff, and she lets me know we’re going to Disney Springs. Now, again, I’ve never been here and idk wtf this actually is besides the fact there is a big LEGO store here. We get on a bus, and we go.

We get there and I see it’s a big outdoor mall thing. Lots of stores and restaurants, basically. Mind you, my anxiety attack? It’s still very much alive and well. She asks me what I wanna do, but I have no idea. I’ve never been here and I’m pretty overwhelmed by the anxiety and all the things currently. She decides we should go to this own restaurant so I can try this one drink her mom likes. I know this drink. She had me make it for her while she was at my house. I had bought all the alcohol and figured out the measurements n everything. So… why would I want to get something I can make at home? Cuz she wanted me to have the official drink. We get there, and this place is pretty high end. Like the cheapest thing on the menu is $19 and it’s an appetizer. The drink was $17.50 and I’m like girl, if ima pay this much for a drink I’d rather it be one I’ve never had but no, she insists I try this drink first.

Now, quick lesson about me, I cannot have sugary things. I’ve had stomach surgery so too much sugar can fuck me up very badly. I mean like severe stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, explosive diarrhea, etc. she is aware of this. She is aware of all my dietary restrictions and physical limitations due to my chronic illnesses so YOU WOULD THINK that she wouldn’t insist on something that could harm me, right?

As I’ve said, I’ve made this drink at home but what I forget is… or what I don’t realize is, this is Disney. Their proportions aren’t going to be the same and the amount of sugar Disney likes to add to FUCKING EVERYTHING is INSANE.
So I get the drink and immediately I realize, oh man… I have a feeling it’s got a lot of simple sugar in this. I can’t tell for sure, so I just sip it lightly. I order some food (the $19 app cuz I’m broke af) and figure maybe if I eat while I drink, it won’t be so bad? About half way through the drink, I realize I cannot continue. My stomach begins to cramp badly. I continue to eat but it doesn’t help. I excuse myself to the bathroom. My anxiety doesn’t help either. I spend like 30 minutes in there just suffering. She finished her food, paid the bill and let me know she was gonna get coffee across the street. I was like cool.

I leave the restaurant, still full of anxiety and now stomach cramps cuz using the bathroom did nothing to help me, and she asks me if I want to get coffee. Girl no. I am literally dying right now. She asks me if I want some of her coffee, which is literally topped with all sorts of sugary things. Girl, no, wtf? And we move on.

At this point, my anxiety attack is slowly growing and turning into a panic attack and I am realizing this. Once again, I try to talk to my friend about how I’m feeling and how I want to talk things out with her so I can relieve myself of this, but once again she said “But Disney, though! Just focus on having fun!” And… I give up again.

She starts bringing me into shops. Shops full of people, while I’m slowly having a panic attack. As we walk through, I begin to hyperventilate and need to leave. We do this a couple of times until eventually, after shes asked me at least 3 times ""what do you want to do?"", I see a nice place to sit by the water and I realize what I want to do. I want to sit. I want to relax. I tell her this, and she looks annoyed, but we sit.

At this point, my package has been delivered and I call my house to find out if it is the set, and if anything else is with it, cuz for all I know, he wrote a rude message with it or something. Nope, it’s just the set. I am relieved to know this and it does take a little bit of anxiety away, and my friend asks if I’m better now. No. I’m not better now. I’m still very much not okay, and I would be better if you would just talk to me and allow me to talk to you, but since you keep blocking me by “but Disney” I’m still at square one. Obviously, I don’t say this. Instead I let her know that I’m a little better and we can get up and move on if she wants, since she clearly wanted to.

We walked around a bit more, and my panic attack honestly still continued to get worse. I don’t know why, but the realization of how close this guy lived dawned on me, and suddenly I began worrying if he maybe was here in the park? Panic attacks do weird things to your brain and my therapist said this is actually normal. Idk. Either way, I had to duck into the bathroom about 2-3 more times to hyperventilate because I didn’t want my friend to see me flipping out. In hindsight… I should have let her see me flip out, since she did not take my situation seriously at all.

Eventually, I finally saw something that interested me. It was a balloon ride. She had also never been on it. We took it, it was fun. I had fun. I also managed to find a drink not full of sugar so I was beginning to relax also. It was nice, as was the nights cool breeze…. But you see, the thing about alcohol is, it’s a depressant and while yes, it calms me down when I’m anxious af, what I didn’t take into account was how sad I actually was deep down. Sad for having to end my friendship with that toxic piece of shit, and sad for the fact my friend standing right here next to me, wasn’t giving a fuck about my feelings and wanted to just be a tour guide and not a friend. So as the night carried on, and she brought us to this other resort so we could watch some fireworks, I became very sad. The panick attack was finally gone but now I was very depressed. So as I watched these fireworks and I knew no one was watching… while everyone was oohing and aahhing… I silently cried.

Then, as we waited for the late bus to pick us up to take us back to our resort, I sat on the ground, in the dark, and continued to cry.

And on the bus to our resort, I silently cried.

Because it was dark. Because it was loud. Because I knew no one could see or hear me, I let myself succumb to my emotions that had been locked inside me all day… and I cried. I wanted nothing more than to cry loudly, scream and just let loose because I was absolutely, positively, fucking miserable. I texted my best friend once we got to the hotel, and asked him once my friend went to sleep if I could call him so I could just vent to someone who cared. He said yes, ofc but… she didn’t go to sleep immediately, and after I showered, she let me know that she was waking me up at 7am  so we could go to Magic Kingdom. It was currently 1:30am. I hadn’t had sleep the night before due to body issues, and she knew this. I had a panic attack all day, and she knew this. I hadn’t properly eaten all day due to stomach problems cuz of that drink, and she knew this…. And now I was gonna get little sleep, to walk around a huge park all day next day??! I told her I did not want this, and why. She got silent and then said, she was still gonna wake me up at 7am, “because Disney”. I didn’t reply and just told my best friend I couldn’t call him, and went to sleep.

The next day, she did wake me up at 7am. We went to get coffee, waited for the bus, and go to Magic Kingdom. Now, again, I’ve never been here so honestly, it was a sight to behold… but I barely got a chance to see main street because she bolted us down it so we could hurry to the area of the park she wanted to go to. I mentioned to her that I needed to eat breakfast and she let me know “there is nowhere to really eat breakfast” as we passed a Starbucks. What she meant was, no where she wanted to go. We get to Tomorrowland, and she shows me the ride she wants to go on. It’s a trolley of sorts that just takes you around, and tells me I have to finish my coffee. It’s like half full. She tells me I gotta chug it or toss it. I don’t wanna toss it… I paid $7 for it cuz Disney and I can’t chug it cuz stomach surgery. I sit down, do my best to sip as much of it as I can then end up tossing it. I wasn’t happy. We get on the ride. It was alright. By the end of it, the coffee didn’t settle right at all and I still need food. She begins bringing me all over, once again asking me what I want to do. Now… here is where my blisters remind me they exist. Before, there was 2 on each foot. Now, there are 4 and two are opened. Walking feels like stepping on glass. My stomach is now upset and I still haven’t eaten. I don’t know what I want to do, other than get some breakfast and I’m beginning to lose my patience with how she isn’t considering my wellbeing AT ALL because Disney. 

We wind up in the Beauty and the Beast area and I see Gaston’s Tavern. I see food. I want this food. She tells me it’s not exactly breakfast and I don’t fucking care. I see what looks like a ham and cheese pastry thing and it looks as breakfast as anything else. We get in line, and she continues to go on and on about how she wants to go here and there, and I say enough. I explain that I know she means well, but I reached my limits a long time ago, I had a panic attack all day yesterday with no sleep on top of it and stomach problems, I’ve had little sleep last night, my stomach is fucked up, my feet are killing me due to these blisters and none of this is being considered at all. I am here for fun. I am here for Disney but I am still
Me. I still have physical limitations due to chronic illness. I still have limitations due to stomach issues and the mental strain now due to fuckhead hasn’t helped. I would appreciate if we just slowed down. She tells me that she’s sorry, and she didn’t mean to make me do anything I didn’t want to, and I tell her I know, but also she just needs to be more aware of my situation.

We get our food and she goes from being at a 100% to a 0% and moping. Now she wants to do nothing. Now I have to drag her from the table to do anything. It’s ridiculous. I just want to be adults respecting each other. Why is this so hard?!

We go on a few rides, I begin to have a bit more fun but she’s still mope. 

We stop to get some cheeseburger egg roll thing and I hear music. She lets me know they’re doing a song and dance routine in front of the castle. I wanna see. I’m excited, for the first time. I FINALLY realize what I want. I wanna see the characters and cast. She has no interest because she’s seen it a bunch but I have never been here. I wanna see, so I drag her and we go see. It’s fun, it’s magical, and I enjoy the shit out of it. Afterwards, I let her know I wanna meet Mickey. She’s like okay, and takes me to where he is. We wait in line for like 30 mins, I get to meet and hug Mickey and I am just so happy. For that moment, all the drama, and sadness, and heartache didn’t exist. I wasn’t just manipulated and used by some narcissistic piece of shit for 3 months who I thought was a trusted friend. That didn’t happen at all. It’s just me and Mickey Mouse and I was happy. My friend though? She’s meh. We leave Mickeys Mansion and the parade is beginning so we watch it. Again, I’m excited cuz it’s so cool. After, I get my hair cut at Disney (yes, it’s a thing) and they put sparkles in my hair and told me I was a pretty princess. I was living my little girl dream. My friend? Bored and said it was time to go to Epcot. I didn’t get to meet any other cast or character and I learned when I got home… she had an app that told me where they all were :|

Now, Epcot was why I wanted to go to Disney in general. I wanted to eat and drink around the world. This was on my bucket list forever. Thing was… remember? My stomach got fucked up the day before so it isn’t exactly happy to receive anything. We’re still gonna go, obviously, and ima make the best of it but oh boy, FL weather also goes from like 70f to 85f when we get there and I become very exhausted. My friend gets to eat and drink around bunch but sadly, I cannot. It sucks but it’s no one’s fault. Honestly, Epcot should have been an entire day planned and not a half day but hindsight. I get to eat at a few places but not many. I had to sit and rest a bunch. I feel like I wasted a ton of time but this couldn’t be helped. I was also very disappointed that I didn’t have enough energy to go into the shops cuz if I was going to spend money, I’d have liked to do it on trinkets around the world. Maybe next time. I won’t spend too much on this topic because here… not a lot happened. Nothing that really could have been helped. My stomach restricted me, and exhaustion fucked me up. It wasn’t until the sun started going down that I got my second wind and began to enjoy myself again. I ate at a few places and soon we had to go back to the hotel because my flight was for 7am, which meant we had to get up for 4am :( which meant… we had to cut this day short. Again, the one park I cared about shouldn’t have been on the last day like this but this wasn’t my planning. This is just something I’ll have to do again in the future with more time.

We got us at 4am, packed and left. Said our goodbyes and that was that. I went home and was very happy to be there. I really hated how I spent so much money on what was supposed to be a vacation but was just stress in another state.

Now…. You’d think after all this, my friend would check in on me… right? See how I was considering I wasn’t in a good mental state for a lot of that??? See if I had least physically recovered?

But no. The texts I got were just her showing me the fun she was having at bars or concerts. Yes, I’m happy for her living her best life. Obviously I want her to be happy but I was just… disappointed how much she didn’t care.

After a few more weeks, she eventually asked me what was wrong since she realized my text tone of voice was very dull and off. So, I told her why.

I told her how I was very depressed. Very mentally unwell, and had been since that bad anxiety attack at Disney. That while I know she meant well, I needed a friend and not a tour guide. That even now, I’m doing very bad and it just sucks. I told her how I started seeing a therapist again and was looking into taking medication but how much I was dreading this because I get severe side effects from depression meds.
I then, just to make sure, reassured her that I appreciated the time spent with her and what she did for me, or tried to do, and how I’ll treasure the good memories.


And she didn’t respond.

I waited a week, and asked her why she didn’t respond? And I was still left on read.

I’ve now waited 3 weeks, and finally texted her again being like “I mean, I figured I’d give you space n stuff in case you needed it but it’s been quite a while. Is this just what this is now? You aren’t gonna talk to me anymore because I spoke how I felt? I thought our friendship was more than that.”

She finally replied. The tldr is “I read what you wrote and didn’t appreciate you making me out to be a shit friend after I spent so much time and money on you. You are ungrateful.”

I paid my own way, and spent just as much time as she did? Yes she paid for the hotel, and I thanked her for it in person and text so I don’t know what else she wanted. I wanted to have fun, just as much as she did. I cannot help that I had a panic attack when I did and I actively tried to help it but she wasn’t willing to help other then trying to distract me, which wasn’t working. She didn’t take my physical, mental or emotional state into consideration at any point and knew my prior health issues for years. I’m not saying she’s a shit friend, nor did I even, but I did point out that I was hurt by the fact I needed a friend during that time but got a tour guide who didn’t want to be bothered by my problems. I’m sorry I had a fucking crisis! It’s like… having a fucking car accident on your way to the park then blaming me for being injured and unable to participate in fun activities! 

So this is where we’re at. She doesn’t want to talk to me anymore because she wasted time, effort and money on me to have a failed fun time due to a mental health crisis. 

I don’t know where to go with this other than to just cut my loss. I’m still dealing with so much that… as much as I don’t want to easily cut things, I don’t have much of a choice. She doesn’t want to discuss anything, that much is clear. She prefers to just avoid and pretend everything is fine unless it’s not with her. I’m not going to beg for her friendship or time. So that’s, that.

1k0sx2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/1k0sx2q/my_lawsuit_against_alden_global_capital_for/,My lawsuit against Alden Global Capital for interfering with Journalism,"
Regarding Colorado District Court Case No. 2025-CV—11

I defeated their ANTISLAPP and other motion to dismiss and reset the stage for my commercial claims against Alden Global Capital and its owners for underfunding their news companies too much. I also have owners, Randall Smith and Heath Freeman locked in as defendants in their personal capacity.

They alerted me that they are imminently preparing to refile another anti-SLAPP motion. If they do, it will be procedurally too late—well beyond the 63-day statutory deadline—and substantively inapplicable, as the case concerns commercial speech, not protected opinion.

The intentional depletion of resources is beyond the breaking point. No matter how hard some reporters and editors across Smith and Freeman’s newspaper conglomerate may try, due to the massive extraction of profits while constantly squeezing resources, their own self-created journalistic standards can no longer be met.

My name is Drew and for those grandparents out there you may know me as the writer and producer of Rocketboom which was the first daily video news program on the web. My mission with Rocketboom was to help democratize the moving image.

If you are younger at heart, but not too much, you may know me as the creator of Know Your Meme, a user content generated platform that became the authority on internet meme culture. My mission with Know Your Meme was to document how information spreads.

Well.

A third site I created called Humanwire allowed people to connect one-to-one with people displaced by war. The site was effective at offering personalized humanitarian support. 

Long story short, much like Gregor woke up one morning to Kafka’s profile of a cockroach, I woke up one morning to the Denver Post’s profile of a con man. The false report indicated my site was a scam, triggered a false arrest, and I faced 12 years in jail. 

After my lawyers pointed out that the portrayal in the Denver Post was false, my case was eventually dismissed but it took three years to get it fully completed, sealed and removed from official databases. By that time, the Denver Post and its sister The Daily Camera had six stories about me as an archetype criminal.

Each time I tried to go back to show the reporters and editors evidence of what happened, they just pointed at the exit without looking and without any discussion. I assumed it had to do with their liability or embarrassment for being wrong, but I kept looking for someone, assuming there must be someone who cares enough to at least sit down once over a cup of coffee and look through the documents.

This is going to sound crazy but over the last seven years I haven’t been able to find anyone. And I have not been able to live with it. Not at all. Not even for one day. I have been stuck with this profile just as intensely and kafkaesque as could be. People in my small town see me through the eyes of the reporters who they trust, and thus won’t take me seriously, and the same is true for most of my family, friends, and colleagues. For the last seven years, I’ve been completely isolated, simply moving through the system, living my own life, raising my son by trying to integrate him the best I can, and working intently on resolving the issue as my main focus, without any known legal means.

I never expected anyone at their companies to care about me, but I expected to find someone who cared to make sure their organization is true, and that their reports are fair and accurate as they promise in their policies. I never found anyone who cares enough, I found exclusive and limited care towards some. Of all things that could go wrong at any business, not caring as a culture is a sure sign of trouble. 

This discovery — the lack of care for their own journalism — sent me deep into a years-long investigation of the companies behind it all. I haven’t just been sitting around; I’ve been conducting my own investigation into their behavior. Aside from raising my son it’s all I have to account for the time.

Somebody needs to care somewhere, Alden is the second largest business of newspapers in America. Most people agree that ethical journalism had difficulty getting a footing with Americans across the press during the last election, leading to confusion about what’s true and why. But Alden’s business strategies are not known to lead to viability, they involve vulture investing. They buy distressed companies and disassemble them on purpose to sell off the assets, like Greyhound (they have been selling off the bus terminals around America too.) 

Here in Colorado where I’m based, my investigation shows they’ve gone way too far with the underfunding and can no longer keep up with their own promises for maintaining the journalistic standards outlined in their own policies. The Denver Post for example is profitable year-over-year but the owners ratchet down the resources and extract profits out. Even the workers who appear to try the hardest seem to often fail because of the lack of support.

Companies are free to set their own journalistic standards and rules - whatever they want — and some media companies have no ethics policy at all (eg The National Enquirer). The Denver Post has a rigorous ethical journalism policy that I found they no longer uphold on a regular basis due to the lack of resources and care. This is different than putting out a bad news article here and there or making mistakes, and it’s a big problem beyond just my own personal grievances. My grievances are essentially a result of this bigger problem of care. They are now disregarding entire policies and finding work-arounds to keep moving forward even as they head further downwards with their capabilities. But if they updated their policies, it would be embarrassing and profits would go down. 

Here in Colorado, I discovered what’s called the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, which is designed to broadly remove legal friction for consumers seeking to hold any business accountable for unfair or deceptive practices. Through a novel application, I am using the Act to come forward as a consumer who was harmed, to expose the dangers other consumers face. I am now, through this Act, standing up on behalf of all consumers in Colorado to present the data that fits the statutes and to have the court decide whether protection is duly warranted.

The remedy includes injunctive orders that would compel Alden to remove or revise its commercial promises about how it produces informational reports—replacing them with representations that realistically reflect the diminished capacity of its current operations.

This case is no longer just about me, a story, or a single hedge fund. It could have an effect in helping to define the future of journalism in America.

If successful, it would help establish a legal precedent that draws a brighter line between journalism and other forms of media that serve purely commercial, ideological, or entertainment goals. All journalism is media — but not all media is journalism.

Genuine “ethical journalism” is not a constant but its practice is grounded in principles of public service, verification, accountability, and editorial independence. When owners like Alden Global Capital strip newsrooms beyond what they need to assure these principles and prioritize profit extraction over public trust, they erode those principles until the product is indistinguishable from opinion, propaganda, or noise. The average reader is then left in a state of confusion, unable to tell what has been reported, verified, and checked against competing facts — and what has simply been published.

That’s the danger: when commercial policies distort journalistic output to such a degree that it no longer functions as journalism. By seeking injunctive relief, I aim not only to hold Smith and Freeman accountable but to reaffirm the standards that distinguish journalism from other media. In doing so, we move closer to a media environment in which the public can more clearly see what is true, and trust once again in the Fourth Estate.

Such an action does not interfere with free speech. Any company can make their own policy and no policy is the most free. This is a matter of making sure companies do not profit off of ethical journalism through deception and bad business practices.

I wanted to send a message on why I quit. You have these rules that fuck me over and only benefit you. Your kids have so much potential but you as a mother make it so they can’t develop properly. Abby is amazing at learning new things like words, sharing, expressing when she’s hungry. Jackson is good at listening when I tell him not to do something, having a creative imagination, and while in fight or flight mode is good at self regulation. All these things I have seen from them while working with them but as soon as I come back the next day, all that is thrown away and I have to start all over helping them develop because you don’t enforce anything. Your 2 and 3 year old kids should have naps. That helps brain development at their age which I’m sure you know but you didn’t want them taking naps because you want to come home from work, put Abby in her crib to sleep so you don’t have to watch her and put Jackson on his tablet so you don’t have to interact with them or be a mother to them. YOU SHOULD NOT BE GIVING YOUR KIDS COFFEE. Point blank period. I don’t know how you got the idea that that is okay but it is not at all and ESPECIALLY don’t force your two year old daughter to come over to drink it like you did one of the only times you let me take them outside before you got home. YOUR KIDS NEED SUNLIGHT. Don’t lock them in a house day in and day out and only let them be outside for 30 minutes once a damn week. That puts a strain on them and puts a strain on the nanny. Everyone is then in a bad mood. Stop encouraging your daughter to bite, slap, kick, all because “she learned that from you”. That’s not something to be proud of. She has hit me and Jackson more times than I can count. Not acceptable. Keeping a dog locked in a tiny cage all day he can’t even stand up in because you don’t want to “take him away from your son” isn’t you being a “good mother” that’s you being a shitty person. You ended up putting the dog in his room afterwards but that was only AFTER I had to tell you how disrespectful and heartbreaking that is to do to him. That shouldn’t of been a conversation to be had. Start paying attention to your kids when they are playing, don’t just ignore them because what that does is show them the only way to get mommy’s attention is to scream bloody murder and cry. Then when I’m there, they are used to getting that negative attention by doing it so that’s their automatic response. For 6-7 hours every single day it’s nothing but screaming because you don’t teach them how to actually communicate and show them that they can get your attention by calmly asking for help. I worked with them every day on that and they would get better but then the next day they are back to screaming all day. Stop punishing Jackson for everything but letting Abby get off the hook because “she’s your little princess” that isn’t fair to him in the slightest. Both kids need to be disciplined for bad behavior. You also need to start paying your next nanny more, dealing with all this and getting 5 Amazon packages delivered every day to you, you can pay more then $15 an hour. Also, if you are going to work a nanny over 40 hours a week, you need to pay time and a half for it. Just because you pay under the table doesn’t except you from the law. You need to realize nanny’s have a life outside of working there. If they are watching them on a weekend and you say it’ll be 4-8, get home at 8. Don’t stay out until 10 with very little communication. If you know that people are coming to the house and know they need to ask questions like where things go, don’t leave your nanny to be by herself trying to keep your two kids safe while also trying to get ahold of you so I can get the answers to the questions the workers are asking. If you keep going at it the way you are you’ll either only get nanny’s that keep them on their tablets all day because it’s the only time they don’t drive your nanny insane because of your poor parenting like your last nanny did or they will quit on the spot like I did.

1k0sw5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1k0sw5z/after_working_at_starbucks_two_weeks_im_not_sure/,After working at Starbucks two weeks I’m not sure I like it.,"To preface this I am a bartender - worked in all kinds of bars both dive and higher end. I love the industry - love making drinks, serving, and just being in fast paced environments. In bars there’s always the ideal of a Cheers experience - that is, a second home where you know all the regulars, their lives, drink, serving an experience above a drink and really make them feel welcome. Sound familiar?

Starbucks’ main mission is to provide this but in coffee world, and I gotta say they fail horribly. When I talk to people like actual humans I get corrected? I said, “What’s up, dude,” when someone pulled into the drive through and I can’t do that(that’s normally how I greet people when they come up to the bar) and I’m supposed to “welcome them in” so I say, “Welcome to Starbucks, home of the Star Buck, can I take your order?” They asked what a Star Buck was and I said, “I dunno I just made that up.” And apparently that’s wrong too.

This might seems like a stupid troll, but I’m dead fucking serious when I say if I go somewhere and I get greeted as ‘valued guest’ or whatever shit I feel alienated, and would rather be talked to like a human by a human - I’d rather be told to fuck off. Show me some personality and have some fun, and, not only that, but I feel weird and awkward talking so sterile and not like me at all.

Maybe my mind has been destroyed by working in smaller, “shitty” kitchens, restaurants, bars, etc, but if you’re looking for genuine human interaction and connection that’s where it happens - where people can actually show some personality and wear a shirt that has some color on it.

I’ve posted before about how lunch typically leads to my highest reading of the day, no matter what i eat or how low carb it is. It isn’t usually a spike, but typically in the 100s-110s after two hours. I also usually take lunch to go for a walk, so it doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.

My husband just thought about it and said could it have to do with the breakfast I’m eating? My breakfast, unlike lunch, is mostly the same thing, especially during the work week. I’ll have chicken breakfast sausages, Mush overnight oats, and a coffee, in total about 30 carbs. Two hours post breakfast has never been a problem, I’m usually in the 80s-90s. So it got my husband thinking is it possible that the oats could be causing a delayed spike? And now I’m a little worried. But i mean we’re talking about 5-6 hours in between blood sugar checks. I feel like that’s a really long time right?

Anyone got any advice or experience on overnight oats causing a delayed reaction?? ",2,1744831030.0,GestationalDiabetes,0,1.0,False

I try to always speak calmly to her and we do time out ""cool downs"" at home but not often because she doesn't misbehave all that much. Afterward I always tell her why she went to time out and try to encourage more positive behavior. 
Anyway, we went to the concert and things started out great. She got about halfway through and she started getting restless. My mom had her and tried to see if she could pass her off to me. She started kicking her feet and I was about to take her out of the building to avoid a disruption but my mom told me she would take her and stand with her in the back. 
The show ended, she was quiet the rest of the time, but then it was time to leave. People were taking photos of their kids class and again she was wanting to run around and didn't want to hold anyone's hands. I told her if she didn't listen we'd have to leave.. I realize in hindsight it probably wasn't my best move. She went into full blown tantrum mode. I picked her up and headed toward the door and she turned it up and was screaming bloody murder. This is the first time she's ever done this. I was mortified, sad, and honestly pretty pissed. I'm still learning to regulate my emotions as well and as I was driving away I was incredibly angry. I then silently cried on the way home. This is the first day I've felt like a true failure as a parent. I never thought I'd be the one that didn't want to go anywhere bc her kid tantrums but here we are. 
My niece and other nephew has concerts coming up in the next few weeks that I promised I'd go to but now we'll be backing out.

The woman who was training me constantly said stuff like “it's going to be a really hard for them to replace me” .. as if I’ve come to replace her. I had 0 experience at the time and had trouble keeping up (which begged the question of why I was hired in the first place. Maybe they were seeking a younger replacement. The woman training me was extremely competent, but also very insecure - she shared some stories with me) so after a little while her and her friend would ostracize me. 

I met other people at the workplace, but they all had polar opposite political views. I don’t mind engaging in a little friendly debate, but they’d regularly make really ridiculous - primarily sexist - comments among themselves that made me cringe. I wanted to just spend my lunch breaks by myself, but it was frowned upon. 

Then they hired another woman to do a job that’s above mine, BUT the manager would constantly ask HER to get him coffee. 

I literally had no experience, I was the youngest one there, and yet he kept giving her this task.. it felt weird (also weird overall, knowing now that it’s not a normal request to begin with). Also, whenever I’d make mistakes, he’d just laugh it off. 

Before I even knew what being a “favorite” is like (I learned the hard way later), my gut instinct told me that I had to get the hell out. So I did. Sometimes I randomly remember that place and imagine that I’d eventually become the woman who trained me and would be scared of being replaced. It’s sad and I hope she eventually moved on. Oh, another red flag was she’d work from home (with no compensation…) 😬",3,1744830926.0,recruitinghell,4,1.0,False

I want to start off with we have so far been to two vet visits, plan to continue with more medical digging. We have also talked with a trainer who specializes in this breed, along with other large protective breeds. 

  
Our Cane Corso is a little over a year and 6 months old. We actively train him daily, with commands, recall, socializing, fetch, ect. We are educated and continue to educate and train our dog and selves. 

He was house trained, took treats gently, knew many commands & tricks, showed no signs of aggression, recall was phenomenal, leash trained. Of course with this breed he was protective of our home and shows ""aggression"" to strangers until we recall him and let him know it's okay, that is his job. 

Note: My husband and I went on vacation March 25 - March 29 but my FIL lives with us (not for any health reasoning) Zuko did not go to a boarding facility. Zuko stayed home and was taken care of by my FIL who is very capable and has his own special relationship with our dog. This is something that is not out of the norm but Im sure could be important. 

  
March 28th he peed in the house and started his decline. He was diagnosed and treated for a UTI April 1st. He had a white blood count of 27,000. April 7th he was taken for a follow up and white blood count was back in normal range, but still continued to decline. The best way to describe him now is he has doggy dementia (we went through this with our previous senior dog a few years ago) of course due to Zuko's age its highly unlikely it is dementia. Below are all his symptoms which each progressively got worse with each day. 

  
**Symtoms:**

* Yawning, painting, licking lips

   * Walking in circles around island
   * Walking in circles around room

* Head and face going dead weight when we hold and pet him

I’ve been seeing a girl for the past few weeks. We’ve been on about 9 or 10 dates so far — nothing super long or intense, just grabbing coffee or a quick walk, talking for an hour or so, and getting to know each other gradually. We’re both university students, so we usually meet once or twice a week depending on our schedules.

What draws me to her is how deep and thoughtful she is. She’s introverted, has gone through some tough experiences, and has made the choice to let go of friendships that weren’t good for her. She’s working a lot on herself right now, and I really admire that. It means a lot to me when someone takes responsibility for their own growth.

As for me, I’m trying out a different way of getting to know someone seriously. I like to ask thought-provoking or even slightly uncomfortable questions — like about politics, values, and life views — not to interrogate, but to understand who she really is beneath the surface. I try to do it gently and respectfully, but I know it can push her a little outside her comfort zone.

Now here’s where I’m conflicted: we haven’t had any physical intimacy yet, not even a kiss. Part of me has been holding back because I want to build a real connection first and not rush things. But I also wonder if I’m hesitating too much — maybe out of insecurity, or fear of seeming too serious too soon. I don’t want to force anything, but I also don’t want to miss the moment.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice on how to navigate a connection that’s growing slowly but feels meaningful?",1,1744830799.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1k0sqn6,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniegravalese/2025/04/14/meghan-markles-brand-is-already-sold-out-and-its-not-just-about-jam/,Forbes ~ It is so much more than jam…,"Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex just launched a collection of spreads, teas, and baking mixes that have already sold out—but how people are connecting with her in the kitchen might be the bigger story.

Markle’s new food and lifestyle brand, As Ever, made its debut this week with the first drop of eight signature products—think raspberry jam in keepsake jars, herbal teas, floral baking mixes, and wildflower honey. Less than a day after the launch was announced, everything on AsEver.com sold out. But this isn’t just another high-profile product drop. It’s part of her shift into lifestyle through the Netflix series With Love, Meghan, which blends soft-focus cooking, hosting rituals, and warm-toned storytelling. What’s more interesting is how people are showing up for it—trying the recipes, baking along with the show, and sharing the results in real-time.

This isn’t just about merch. The show, which blends slow-living rituals with intentional cooking and gentle storytelling, isn’t just giving viewers something to watch—it’s giving them permission to slow down and make something.

What Markle’s doing here isn’t just a pivot or a lesson in elegance. For some viewers, it’s suggesting that maybe you already have it.

From Royal Protocol to Raspberry Jam

The tone of As Ever is notably quiet. No press tour. No massive influencer unboxings (yet). Just a soft rollout: muted pastels, delicate florals, and pantry items that feel like they belong in an actual kitchen, not just a curated flat lay.

That’s intentional. While it’s backed by Netflix’s consumer products arm and arrives alongside a glossy new series, the brand’s real power is in its emotional pitch. As Ever isn’t selling prestige—it’s selling a feeling. A moment. Something calm. Something yours.

In that way, it’s a sharp departure from the royal branding machine Markle left behind. Where the monarchy traffics in duty and distance, this leans all the way into intimacy. It says: come in, have some tea, let’s bake. And that’s resonating.

Critics Might Shrug—But Some Women Are Tuning In

US-ENTERTAINMENT-NETFLIX-MARKLE-SERIES

If you browse the IMDb reviews for With Love, Meghan, the reactions are… mixed. Some viewers find the show overly curated, even “bland.” Others call it comforting, beautifully shot, and—above all—relatable. One reviewer wrote, “It’s like a Pinterest board, but in the best way.”

That’s the line Markle seems to be walking. For every criticism about polish, there’s someone quietly empowered by what they’re seeing. The message isn’t “do it perfectly”—it’s “do it anyway.” Make the thing. Light the candle. Try the focaccia. See what happens.

It’s a familiar arc.

Martha Faced It, Too–But Not In The Same Way

In her early years, Martha Stewart was often knocked for being “too perfect” or “too privileged”—a woman selling an aspirational lifestyle that felt out of reach. But over time, her brand became about something else entirely: clarity, consistency, and confidence in the kitchen. She wasn’t just showing people how to bake bread. She was giving them permission to try.

That’s what’s happening here. As Ever doesn’t land like a prestige product drop—it lands like an invitation. And the fact that everything on AsEver.com sold out in less than 24 hours? That says something. Not just about brand power—but about where we are, culturally, when it comes to food, influence, and what we want from the people who make both.

How People Are Engaging with Markle’s Brand

Early adopters aren’t just buying the jam—they’re watching her show, making her recipes, talking about it, and connecting over it. On Threads, YouTuber and podcast host Tabitha Banks (@TabithaSpeaksPolitics) shared a post about baking her first-ever loaf of focaccia after watching With Love, Meghan:

“I was intimidated and never would have attempted it. But Meghan Sussex inspired me to give it a try — and here we are: I’m making homemade focaccia bread!”

That post has racked up over 17,000 views—and it’s not alone. From Twitter to Threads to IMDb, you’ll find people talking less about the product and more about the feeling it sparked. Not just “this looks good,” but “I could do this too.”

It’s not a lifestyle brand that’s telling people what elegance looks like. It’s suggesting that maybe you already have it.

The ‘Little Treat Economy’ and Why It Matters Right Now

When the Duchess of Sussex launched her $14 jar of jam, the internet noticed. The product sold out within hours—prompting admiration, side-eyes, and curiosity in equal measure. But in a country where 1 in 3 Americans lives paycheck to paycheck, it begs the question: who’s buying this, and why?

It turns out the timing may be exactly right.

According to Tastewise, a generative AI consumer insight platform, Meghan’s jam taps into a broader cultural moment known as the “little treat economy.” Tastewise reports a 71% year-over-year increase in mentions of small indulgences, with interest in artisan jams specifically rising by nearly 48%. This isn’t just a blip: they predict an 18% growth in these kinds of purchases over the next year.

The pattern goes beyond spreads. Gen Z and younger millennials are gravitating toward small, joyful luxuries—matcha lattes (+63%), gourmet chocolates (+31%), artisan coffees (+52%), and mini desserts (+38%)—as ways to create moments of comfort without breaking the bank. Tastewise CEO Alon Chen explains it like this: “Products like Meghan Markle’s jam are part of a larger shift where small indulgences are seen as a cost-effective way to enjoy life’s little pleasures, especially in times of economic uncertainty.”

But it’s not just about the food. It’s about what it represents.

“These tiny luxuries,” Chen adds, “are fueling a special kind of comfort and connection. From afternoon snacks paired with tea and toast to indulgent self-care rituals, they’re creating emotionally resonant experiences that feel deeply personal—and deeply needed.”

In that way, As Ever isn’t just selling jam. It’s selling a cultural reset.

Criticism, Connection, and the Cultural Mirror

Of course, not everyone’s on board. Reviews of With Love, Meghan on IMDb range from warm to wary, with some critics calling the show overly curated or leaning too far into lifestyle fantasy. But that tension is part of what makes this launch fascinating. Because for every comment about “Pinterest-core,” there’s someone finding the courage to bake something for the first time. There’s someone building a Sunday ritual around tea, jam, and stillness. And for a brand like As Ever, that kind of soft engagement—small, sincere, and intentional—might be more powerful than a viral moment.

It’s not the first time a woman entering the lifestyle space has been met with scrutiny. Martha Stewart faced early critiques for being too polished, too aspirational, too perfect. Yet, over time, she transformed that perception—building trust through consistency, clarity, and a kind of elevated practicality.


As Ever may be facing its own set of cultural biases, but the tension is familiar: how do you balance aspiration with relatability without inviting backlash?

Whether it’s a keepsake jar of jam or a shortbread cookie mix with flower sprinkles, what both women seem to understand is that lifestyle branding isn’t just about products—it’s about how people feel engaging with them.

This Is About More Than Merch

As Ever isn’t selling just raspberry spread or floral shortbread. It’s selling a feeling. A way of being. A moment in the day when you pause and do something kind for yourself—or someone else.

And in a culture that often asks women to go faster, do more, and present themselves perfectly, the act of cooking something small and lovely—just because—is its own quiet form of resistance.

It’s not just about jam. It’s about how people are showing up for themselves. Like Julia, Nigella, and Martha before her, Markle is showing people they can make something beautiful—even when the world tells them otherwise.",7,1744830774.0,RoyaltyTea,2,1.0,False

**Dear Word Wizard,**

Let’s get one thing straight.

You don’t need a sleek brand deck, a seven-figure launch funnel, or a hypnotic voiceover with background jazz to make your copy *feel* expensive.

You need words that *command authority*, *ooze confidence*, and *drip value* from every line.

Great copy doesn’t ask for attention. It owns the room.

And today, I’m going to show you how to write like you’ve got an Amex Black Card even if you’re running your business from a second hand laptop with coffee stains on the keyboard.

Let’s get into it.

# 1. Lead With Confidence, Not Permission

Weak copy sounds like it’s begging to be liked. Premium copy talks like it already owns the room.

**Broke Copy:**  
“Hi there, just wanted to let you know about something that might be helpful…”  
**High-End Copy:**  
“This is exactly what your business has been missing.”

>

# 2. Elevate Your Vocabulary, But Don’t Sound Like a Thesaurus

Premium copy is articulate, not academic. It’s about precision, not pretension.

**Don’t say:** “Our product is really good and helps with stuff.”  
**Do say:** “Our software automates your workflow so you get more done in less time with zero overwhelm.”

>

# 3. Drop Proof Like You’re Rolling Receipts

Luxury is proven. If you want to sound like a pro, show them you’ve done the thing.

Even if you don’t have a mountain of testimonials, you can still flex proof.

**Examples:**

* “Used by 127 freelancers last quarter alone”
* “Generated over 300 signups in 3 days without paid ads”
* “Built using feedback from 500+ course creators”

>

# 4. Speak in Outcomes, Not Features

Nobody cares how the watch was made. They care that it makes them feel like James Bond.

**Broke Copy:** “Our app has 5 automation tools”  
**High-End Copy:** “Save 10+ hours a week while your business runs itself”

>

# 5. Make the Reader Feel Like They’re Part of an Elite Club

Luxury brands don’t market to everyone. They speak to the right people in the right way.

**Example:**  
“This isn’t for beginners. It’s for creators ready to stop winging it and start scaling with strategy.”

>

Now, let’s turn these principles into a plug-and-play AI prompt that helps you instantly upgrade your copy tone.

# The Ultimate ✨ Premium Copy Tone Prompt

We are going to do this in **3 simple steps.**

# Step 1: Fill in [describe your offer]

This is the product, service, or lead magnet you're writing premium-feeling copy for.

**Examples:**

* \[A 5-day challenge to help course creators grow their audience\]
* \[An AI tool that helps marketers write ad copy faster\]
* \[A membership for fitness coaches who want more high-paying clients\]

# Step 2: Fill in [describe your target audience]

Who is your offer aimed at? Be specific about their level, ambition, or pain point.

**Examples:**

* \[New consultants who want to land high-ticket clients\]
* \[Online store owners who feel overwhelmed by marketing\]
* \[Busy freelancers who need to scale without burning out\]

# Step 3: Fill in [main benefit your audience wants]

This is the transformation or outcome they’re chasing. Think in terms of status, time, freedom, or results.

**Examples:**

* \[Land more clients without pitching every day\]
* \[Build a scalable business with less stress\]
* \[Get your time back while still growing revenue\]

# Now, Copy and Paste This Prompt Into Your Favourite AI Tool: I recommend Claude

    Write a short block of persuasive, premium-sounding copy (3-4 sentences max) for a [describe your offer] aimed at [describe your target audience]. The tone should be confident and value-packed. Focus on how this offer helps them [main benefit your audience wants]. Do not use hype or exaggeration. Make it feel exclusive, elevated, and outcome-driven.

# Where to Use This Technique for Maximum Impact

When your offer needs to feel high-value, these premium copy principles can give it that “this must be expensive” energy without changing the price tag.

**Here’s where to drop this elevated tone:**

* **Sales page hero section** *Before:* “Our software helps you automate emails” *After:* “Finally, a smarter way to scale without adding stress or headcount”
* **Landing page intros for lead magnets** *Before:* “Sign up for our free checklist” *After:* “This 3-step framework is what top-tier marketers use to triple their conversions, get instant access”
* **Email opening lines or subject lines** *Before:* “Want to grow your audience?” *After:* “The smartest creators aren’t posting more. They’re doing this instead.”
* **Social media captions for premium services** *Before:* “Offering 1-on-1 coaching” *After:* “Not for everyone. Just those ready to level up with a personal, ROI-focused strategy.”

**Pro tip:** Use this style selectively when you want to create *perceived value*, establish *authority*, or attract a *more premium buyer*.

# Coming Up Next...

Next week, I’m pulling back the curtain on one of the most underrated tools in a copywriter’s arsenal.

**Rhythm and Cadence.**

You’ll learn how to write copy that sounds so smooth in your reader’s head, they can’t stop reading.

Until then, polish your tone, elevate your words, and let your copy walk in like it owns the place.

1k0sq5h,https://i.redd.it/w5c8ty5bx8ve1.png,Feedback for my split world world book [fantasy],"# Prologue

*You ever wake up and feel like the world’s a loading screen you forgot to click past? Yeah. That was me. Every day. Until it wasn’t.*

There are routines, and then there are loops.

Wake up. Brush your teeth. Doomscroll. Go for a walk. Wonder if the universe is broken or if it’s just you. Repeat.

Asher Keith had been stuck in that loop for months—nineteen years old and already feeling like someone had left his story unfinished. No map, no mission. Just vibes and bills.

And then, one Tuesday morning, something… bent.

It wasn’t loud. No booming voice. No glowing sky. Just a shimmer in the corner of his eye, like a cracked screen in reality. He blinked, and the world changed.

Sidewalk gone.

Sky—wrong color.

Air—too quiet.

Forest.

Not like the ones in parks. This one breathed. Watched.

He wasn’t asleep. Wasn’t high. Wasn’t hallucinating.

He was somewhere else. Somewhere that didn’t care what he thought.

And for the first time in a long time… he felt awake.



# Chapter One: The Loop

You ever walk the same street so many times that your body turns before your brain does?

That was Asher’s morning. Every morning.

Same cracked sidewalk. Same crooked mailbox. Same rust-stained driveway with the car no one had moved since February. The same chihuahua three houses down that hated him with the passion of a thousand suns.

He wasn’t headed anywhere important. Not anymore.

College had kicked him out with all the grace of a low battery warning—brief, annoying, and somehow his fault. Two semesters of academic probation, existential dread, and one very public panic attack in the middle of Psych 101, and he was back home. Back in the bedroom with old fantasy posters, dusty bookshelves, and a closet full of clothes that didn’t fit who he was anymore.

His mom called it “taking a breath.”

His dad didn’t call it anything.

So now, at nineteen, Asher Keith walked.

Every day. Same time. Same route. Like muscle memory was doing the work while his mind rebooted.

He wore the same gray hoodie he’d had since junior year and the same black joggers that were now one loose thread from becoming shorts. Earbuds in. Lo-fi beats turned up. Toast in one hand. Half-warm coffee in the other. His morning ritual wasn’t sacred—it was survival.

And today, something felt... wrong.

Not “I left the stove on” wrong.

Not “a serial killer’s behind me” wrong.

Just… wrong in a quiet, subtle way. Like stepping into a room you didn’t realize someone had just left. The air was still, but too still. The cicadas weren’t buzzing. The streetlamps, still on even after sunrise, flickered in sync like they were glitching.

He paused.

Checked his phone.

No notifications. No alerts. Just the usual collection of unread messages and doom-scrolling apps judging him.

He tucked it away again and kept walking.

That’s when it happened.

The sidewalk shimmered.

Only for a second. Like heat waves over asphalt.

Then again. This time it stayed.

The shimmer thickened. The air pressed against his skin like static before a thunderstorm.

His earbuds crackled, then died.

The music stopped.

And the sound of the world—everything—cut out like a plug had been yanked.

He blinked.

And the sidewalk disappeared.





He didn’t trip—he dropped.

One foot landed on moss.

The other slid on damp stone.

He stumbled forward, caught himself against a tree with bark that felt like cracked glass and velvet.

His breath hitched.

No cars.

No fences.

No houses.

Just forest.

Tall, ancient trees curved overhead like rib bones from some sleeping god. The canopy filtered the light into a pale green glow. Mist clung to the ground like a warning. Every leaf seemed to move on its own rhythm, like it was breathing with him.

“What the...” Asher whispered, and immediately clamped a hand over his mouth.

Sound carried weird here. Like it echoed sideways.

He spun in place.

No trail. No path. No “you are here” marker.

His heart kicked into second gear. Adrenaline surged. The coffee cup slipped from his hand, shattered against a root that looked too much like a knuckle.

He wasn’t dreaming.

He *knew* what dreaming felt like. Dreams didn’t have smells. This place did. The earthy, heady scent of rot and wood and something faintly sweet, like fermented fruit.

He touched the tree again, slower this time.

Rough. Real.

He reached into his hoodie pocket. Phone still there.

Pulled it out.

No signal.

Battery icon flickered, then vanished.

The screen cracked down the middle without warning—like the phone itself didn’t want to be here either.

“Okay,” he whispered, backing up. “Cool. Cool cool cool. Not panicking. Just... assessing.”

A low groan rumbled in the distance.

Not thunder.

Not wind.

Something else.

Something *alive.*

A branch snapped.

He jumped.

Nothing behind him.

But something was *there.*

He didn’t see it.

He *felt* it. A pressure. Like the forest was watching.

He started walking.

Not because he knew where to go.

Because standing still felt like asking to be devoured.

The ground sloped downward. Roots jutted out at odd angles, like bones breaking through dirt. He ducked under a low-hanging branch and emerged into a small clearing.

And there it was.

A black stone tablet, half-buried under moss.

Because of course there was.

He knelt. His hand hovered midair, fingers shaking.

The moss fell away at the slightest touch.

Glowing words began to scrawl across the surface like liquid light:

*To walk between worlds is not a gift.* *It is a debt.* *Paid in fear. Repaid in strength.* *If you are reading this, your path has already begun.*

Asher’s stomach dropped.

His mouth went dry.

The glow faded.

The tablet cracked.

Turned to dust in his hands.

He sat back, hard, nearly falling over.

This wasn’t a dream.

This was something else.

This was a *world.*

A new one.

A terrifying one.

He stared into the empty space where the tablet used to be and muttered, “Okay... don’t die in the tutorial zone.”





The growl came from the trees.

Low. Wet. Wrong.

He turned slowly—heartbeat in his ears.

Something moved.

A shape.

Tall. Four-legged. Catlike.

But not.

Eyes blinked in rows.

Fur steamed like it had just stepped out of boiling water.

Bones jutted from its shoulders like natural blades.

And it stared directly at him.

Not snarling.

Not rushing.

Just... watching.

Asher didn’t wait to find out what that meant.

He ran.

Branches slapped at his arms. Thorns tore his hoodie. His breath came in panicked bursts. His foot caught a root—he hit the ground hard, rolled, scrambled back up, and kept running.

The creature followed. He didn’t hear it. He *felt* it. The weight. The presence. Like the air was bending around it.

He saw a break in the trees. A clearing.

He dove.

Tumbled.

Hit the moss like a sack of bricks.

Rolled.

Came up coughing, chest burning, legs jelly.

The creature stopped at the edge.

Its eyes locked on his.

And then—it turned to mist.

Gone.

Just... gone.

He stared at the spot where it had been.

Breathing hard. Shaking.

Then he collapsed back onto the moss and laughed.

Not because it was funny.

Because he was alive.

And somehow, the fear was fading.

It was being replaced by something else.

Wonder.

It’s been like this since… forever I suppose.

In my 20s, I thought it is bc I just work & party too much but now things are different, such as:

-Mediterranean diet with balancing glucose
-I gym & take long walks with my dog plus I bike to work.
-Limit my alcohol & coffee intake
-To limit stress I changed my work-life balance and had therapy 2 years for anxiety management
-Blood tests doesn’t show anything crazy. Docs don’t have much ideas

What am I doing wrong? Anybody feel this way too? 

Thanks ladies🫶

We had to take our 7 month old to the hospital on Sunday due to her forcibly puking what looked like coffee grounds. She continued to do it for hours and was lethargic and dehydrated as she couldn't drink without puking. They did an x ray and then flurostudy and found out that she had a hiatal hernia.  They told us they were going to refer us to a G.I doctor and kept her until she was able to keep down a bottle.  They didn't explain very well what a hiatal hernia is, or what our next steps are regarding the hernia except that she may need surgery, but they did start her on meds. Is this something that needs surgery to fix or is it manageable with meds. And if it is, will she have to be on medication for this for her whole life? I know you guys aren't doctors but I just want an idea of what to expect.  I feel terrible for my girl 😔",1,1744830581.0,HiatalHernia,1,1.0,False

Nvidia claim it’s a 4080 rig,  Out of 5 sessions, 2 actually hold 240 FPS. The other 3? A generous 170-180 FPS lagging, like the cloud rig’s on a coffee break.

Ping? London West server’s a rock-solid 5ms. The one good thing.

Also It **doesn't let me cap my in-game FPS**. So guess what? Stutters galore. Either 240 or choppy nonsense, no in-between. Beside, Every single session I have to **log in to my EA account** since they ditched the Steam version. And of course, EA — being EA — logs me out after like **5 sessions in a day, complaining about too many devices**.

I work a 9-5 and play around 3 hours a day (except the last 4 weeks — went full-time gamer on holiday). It’s good when it works, but feels like dating a flaky situationship: great on the good days, miserable on the bad ones.

Got mixed feelings… **except for single-player games — those run like a dream.** Thanks for reading!

1k0skob,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k0skob/m24f24_im_getting_to_know_someone_with_whom_i/,"M24/F24 - I’m getting to know someone with whom I feel a deep connection, but I’m unsure how to move forward","Hola! Hi! everyone ;) I’ve been (24M) seeing a girl(24F), for the past few weeks. We’ve been on about 9 or 10 dates so far — nothing super long or intense, just grabbing coffee or a quick walk, talking for an hour or so, and getting to know each other gradually. We’re both university students, so we usually meet once or twice a week depending on our schedules.

What draws me to her is how deep and thoughtful she is. She’s introverted, has gone through some tough experiences, and has made the choice to let go of friendships that weren’t good for her. She’s working a lot on herself right now, and I really admire that. It means a lot to me when someone takes responsibility for their own growth.

As for me, I’m trying out a different way of getting to know someone seriously. I like to ask thought-provoking or even slightly uncomfortable questions — like about politics, values, and life views — not to interrogate, but to understand who she really is beneath the surface. I try to do it gently and respectfully, but I know it can push her a little outside her comfort zone.

Now here’s where I’m conflicted: we haven’t had any physical intimacy yet, not even a kiss. Part of me has been holding back because I want to build a real connection first and not rush things. But I also wonder if I’m hesitating too much — maybe out of insecurity, or fear of seeming too serious too soon. I don’t want to force anything, but I also don’t want to miss the moment.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice on how to navigate a connection that’s growing slowly but feels meaningful?",2,1744830353.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

**Weight** \- 70 kg

**Run** \- 3.65 km

**Calories consumed** \- 1200

Started the day strong. Woke up on time and went on a run, could not complete the 5k. Reached home on time and started learning JavaScript. I've realized that watching 10 lectures a day would be a bit too much for me and I have reduced them to 4 lectures a day. I will gradually increase them. Reached college to work on the project. It was not a productive period as the deadline is approaching and we have not progressed a bit.

Reached back home to 14:00. Then spent some time online. Had a headache so made a coffee which surprisingly had a positive impact. Didn't go to TIME as I am not feeling it. I swear I will go tomorrow, I am guilty of waste my parents hard earned money and I do want to see their money go in vain. It will be quant tomorrow and will definitely be useful.

Went to mall with family. Had a KFC burger which was about 400 Kcal. Later on had 2 pieces of tandoori Kebab which would be 200 Kcal combined. I had no other choice but to do this. Tomorrow is Real Madrid vs Arsenal so probably Ill stay awake to watch.

Could not read a book as I was lazy towards it.

It rained at night so the track would be wet tomorrow so I have to be careful. This is not an excuse but a friendly reminder.

I am a college student living in NYC and like going to cafes to relax and enjoy a nice cup of coffee. But it’s almost impossible to do that because all the seating is occupied by people working on their laptops. They also never leave. My feeling is, if you are rich enough to have a remote job, you should work  in a library or at home. I think they just do it bc it feels maybe less like work or cooler to do it in a cafe. They are treating cafes like their offices with no regard to patrons that want to enjoy coffee without working!  I wanted to post this to see if anyone else felt the same way.

1k0sh3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1k0sh3h/stomach_problems_my_whole_life_any_advice_would/,Stomach problems my whole life. Any advice would be grateful!,"I’ve had issues with my stomach my whole life and now at the age of 28 I’ve decided I can’t live like this any longer and want to sort it out. For the record I’m very healthy guy and I eat very clean. The only thing I know that affects my gut is if I’m anxious, this worsens symptoms, but I don’t struggle with anxiety that often so I know it’s something else. 

For my whole life I’ve been prone to bloating and being gassy. This is my biggest issue. My mother is also like this. I even can bloat when I’m hungry, on an empty stomach, or from drinking water, and of course from eating. When I have gas, I often pass huge quantities, it never really smells but it’s just an insane amount of gas. This is obviously pretty annoying and it’s uncomfortable and leads to cramps if I have to hold it. I also am always belching after eating. Never burping, only belching. I also get an acidy feeling too, never acid coming up but just that tight sharp feeling often after eating. I often feel better in the body from not eating if I’m honest. Obviously my brain doesn’t but my stomach will. 

I know some obvious things will make me gassier like beans or broccoli (the usual suspects) but there’s definitely something else going on. Too much coffee isn’t good for me, especially more acidic coffee. I don’t think I have a gluten or dairy intolerance as I’ve eaten this my whole life. 

More recently I realised that I’ll be uncomfortable when trying to sleep with bloating or I will wake up with gas. Recently I was prescribed omeprazole which seemed to help a bit with making me less acidy but as soon as I ran out, back to normal. I feel like my stool could be more solid too. I realise that doctors only want to prescribe medicine here in NL so I’d rather try diets/avoid certain foods or incorporate more, try different habits to fix whatever I have. 

If anything resonates I’d love to hear. I know this will probably be a long journey for me but I want to be able to enjoy life again. Thanks in advance! ",4,1744830105.0,ibs,1,1.0,False

I have an Inspire 3 and have noticed my heart rate is a bit sensitive it seems (I'm up and down between 80 and 120 all day which is where my moderate threshold is). I looked at it earlier when I finished typing something up (hadn't been overly stressed about it but I'm a fairly quick two hand typist) and noted it was at 130bpm e.g. just into my moderate (e.g. I frequently pick up 5 mins of zone time here or there when seated at my desk). In the space of 30 seconds though it then drops to like 85bpm and it didn't graph at over 130. I'm just thinking I might be a bit spikey anyway (resting during the day sits at 80 to 85) but I'm thinking this is getting ""tricked"" into thinking I'm having a workout when I type?

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

Just joined this subreddit, seeking some information about a weird experience. I have no idea if anyone will have answers for this but it was just confusing and I’d like to understand more of what might’ve happened. If this post would be better suited for a different subreddit, totally send it my way! 

This weekend three of my friends and I each took a point. We took pre-measured rocks in pill casings. I’ve rolled quite a few times, but haven’t done anything in a little over a year, so I was feeling pretty nervous about what to expect (I suffer from a heavy dose of anxiety lol). After about an hour in, everyone was rolling pretty hard but me. I felt a few times that tingling/bubbling sensation like I was about to start coming up but nothing escalated past that. After another 30 mins I decided to take another ~1/4 point. Still nothing. I did feel different from before taking anything. My anxiety was gone, didn’t have pain in my body, and I was more energetic but I can say for sure I was not rolling. My eyes didn’t dilate (a huge sign for me that I’m rolling), didn’t feel that overwhelming euphoric or dancey feeling I normally get, no heightened bodily sensations, etc. It just felt like I had a cup of coffee or something. I know for sure we took MDMA, as everyone took from the same stash and the source was the same one we always get our stuff from, so I trust it.

Some additional context that I think might relate/be helpful info- I’m on a very low dose SNRI (25mg). I’ve rolled on this prescription before and felt the full effects of MDMA. The half life of this prescription is 11 hours, and I skipped my dose the day of the roll to avoid conflict. I take vitamin D3 daily and did take that day of, not sure if that would affect anything in any way. We all took magnesium a few days leading up to the day of the roll. I’m a much larger person than the three friends I took it with, but have taken the same amount as smaller friends in the past and have had more intense reactions than them. We all had a pretty large meal about three hours prior to taking it. 

Have no idea if any of that info is helpful but just listing anything I can think might’ve affected my experience. Can Molly just not work sometimes?? Is my brain resistant to its effects now? What the heck happened?? Feel free to ask me questions or to clarify anything!",2,1744829800.0,ecstasyMDMA,3,1.0,False

I'll stop waiting at around 5pm of start date.
I plan to leave evening or early morning next day.
----

Context:
Realized that I've been slaving away at work too much and have been left behind regarding current events and the vibe in general - literally it's been a blur. I attended a wedding of one of my hs barkadas last week with me just fying in that morning (Friday) and then flying back to the metro the morning right after (Saturday) because I had meetings already set on Monday and some stuff needing my signature. My whole barkada went to vacation (they're still there) to a remote island and I see they've been having so much fun. I'm very ok with my situation tho, I am comfortable. Ngl, lowkey jealous of many people that can have time to be carefree.

Recently been musing that I want 2025 to be the year I finally have my ISBN - i would need time to relax, free my head, and write (poetry). I just need  quiet time to relax and a place that's peaceful.

Long weekend's here and I don't have plans yet. I can invest in time and maybe make these next 4 days a build up of foundation for great new friendships. Not really keen on a relationship, I may have crossed over the line already for any interest. I just want to get to know the younger crowd and feed off good energy. I have gotten to know that a lot of people younger have great insights in life, are yearning to build up themselves (which I find fascinating a topic for writing) and definitely know more about the local scene.

-----
I would love to be kidnapped as an introvert by an extrovert.
-----

Idea:
Found out there are so many great people at reddit.
I set a budget to spend on all days out.
I can drive anywhere in Luzon (maybe not beyond Baguio and Quezon tho)
I can bring my drone and can take coverage of trip.
Don't include me, I'd rather just be like the cameraman for extreme sports that takes the great shots but remains unnamed.
Roadtrip, I just do my thing, and you can do yours - would love to invest in this for more long term friendships. Looking if this setup/experiment can work.

YOU+
1. Solo traveller (you can bring a female friend also for safety)
2. Good planner: Would love to know what solo trips you've taken and are looking to take as reference - tg and swap pics please - hope it's ok.
3. Not a palamon, i love the independent and very practical type, i would love to hear your stories and protips: ikaw na bahala mag plan din please sa budget, i'll share once you reach out
4. Have socials that can post stuff - at least have an eye for good shots. I would love to be that supportive kaladkarin friend.
5. Looking to take postgrad or taking postgrad and just want to go somewhere. Bored af like me. I want to learn from you. (Marketing, sport sci, archi, tourism, biology, law, spec doctor, and maybe not STEM field)
6. Dude not married nor any attachments please - like age 24 to 30 i guess? Im more interested in Genz stories, will be managing/working with genz in the future and would like to invest this time to understand the mindset. I can go lower but I dont want to be judged please.
7. At least a bit ok features please, be confident - has been investing in own health (running, gym, spin, etc.) Super bonus if you know ballet, tap dancing, golf, diving or any sport. I'd love to learn.
8. If this is you above, you probably don't need me in your life (lol) and that's very ok, would love to be part of it tho. Again i'll do my thing, you do yours - i would just like to be kidnapped at times in the future (e.g. late dinners/cofree, early morning runs, etc)
9. Please be around makati/bgc for easier logistics (just a preference)
10. Maybe become my wingman in the future? I love brutally honest and unapologetic people. Would be great if you can teach me about wines and sht.
11. Please don't be a serial killer, please do be interested in a lot of things tho (please just be a listener/watcher of hallyu not someone who stans..) and be very attentive to details

ME:
1. Tech person in strategy and transformation that is a frustrated writer (UP and DLSU never got back to me on my MA Creative writing :sadt:). I have a masters in business and am looking to pursue higher ed - im just fking scared atm.
2. I used to play ultimate, go mountain hiking (im still part of an estsblished club), go stargazing (with PAS), go to spoken word/creative events (i still sometimes and fully support local artists)
3. Recently back to the gym, Af if it's of any help, got a coach to help me and so that I dont need to think anymore (much like this trip, id just like to spend and not think of admin stuff) - i'm 5'7, 180lbs
4. I run at UPD every weekend. I go to tagaytay randomly on a weekday to eat noodles near Orlina museum. It's my thing to drive and listen to podcasts while on long drives.
5. Infinitely curious, i get bored when I'm not learning anything
6. There are bouts of loneliness/clinginess so I would need some understanding on that end. I am self aware and i want to be honest so fu if you're judging me reading this (lol)
7. Part of forgotten gen trying to take revenge.
8. I am not smart, i tend to go on tangents a lot (may be late onset adhd): i am a wellspring of useless information tho again i know i do not know so many things so i'm looking to learn.
9. I have a small car that i drive around with
10. I love both cats and dogs and any animal for that mattee (trips to museums and art galleries are my thing) but i don't want to take care of them - i am very particular with smells
11. I can eat the same food every day, tho been doing calorie deficit, cannot survive OMAD (is it healthy?) - i am constantly sleepy so i need lots of coffee, i would def love recos for good vege meals

Caveat:
-----

a. Please don't judge. I am not married. I have my own stories.

b. When you message me please say bananafish and the number of bullets that has a period at the end (for YOU+ME)

c. I understand this is such a stretch, maybe 70%-80% fit is my criteria.

d. I just want some quiet time, i already have a friend like above but she went back to her province for a month to detox too. She also has her own group already.

e. Would love to start my own or find a partner in crime that's also very busy. we can learn from ea other and grow.



-----
TLDR;
-----
Thank you. Again, this is M4F.

Looking for 22 to 30 F - solo traveller - ok for 2x F.

I want to learn more from GenZ.

Travel somewhere up to Sunday (Elyu, Baguio, Batangas, Bataan, etc) - plan w/ me - do due diligence.

You do your thing, i do mine when having arrived. Would love to make friends.

1k0s2vl,https://i.redd.it/k6b3bjqus8ve1.png,Blackbird Review.,"I achieved one of my small dreams of eating at a fine dining restaurant for no reason, and I just wanted to make this review for those interested to dine at the Central Ayala Triangle restaurant, Blackbird at Nielson Tower.

It is expensive for most people. Most likely, people will eat here for events, milestones, or if you are an Ayala or wealthy foreigner, then this is just a normal restaurant.

Some notes to consider when planning to eat here is to probably book a reservation. Call them at their mobile number at their working hours, and they will take care of the rest—just give them the details.  
Walk-in is okay, but peak holidays or events such as Valentines, Christmas, amongst others—I cannot list them all—and I avoid peak days as much as possible. Peak hours are dinner time; a lot of people during dinner. Also, dress nicely—not formal, but look clean.

**Service**  
Fast and attentive. Ask all you want about the dishes, and they will answer. Also, ask for service water if you do not want to be charged for sparkling or still water.

**Food**  
Sometimes some dishes will be unavailable, but that’s rare. Nonetheless, the array of meals is wide and will cater to most tastes. Note that the menu has no pictures at all, so ask for details about that. Tell the servers if you have allergies as well. 

For what I have, I mostly stick with what I like, so I cannot really be a full judge on that, but their meat is excellent. No complaints. Had the Onyx Cube and Silver Striploin, and they’re great!  
Mushroom soup is also very tasty.

**Drinks**  
They have alcohol (wine, spirits, cocktails, etc.), coffee, and tea. I like their wine selection—I suggest the rosé. (Also to note: their bottled wine is marked up twice, so maybe, just maybe, think long and hard if it’s worth it.)

**Dessert**  
Their ice cream is impeccable. Must try Burnt Butter ice cream. Sometimes, I just go there and order ice cream.

**Location**  
Superb location. Restaurant parking may be scarce, especially during peak days and times, so I suggest planning accordingly. It’s first come, first serve basis. There is a Gabriela Silang paid parking lot nearby, so that’s a Plan B—but it is always full in my experience. 2nd floor area is cool. Give it a try.

Maybe you can reserve parking if it is a big booking or if it’s non-peak times. Very convenient to walk to also. Felt comfortable with security + security of the guests themselves.

Overall, the Blackbird experience is great. Good food, ambiance, and service. 

There are a lot of business moguls, foreigners, and sometimes artists inside, so do as you will with that knowledge. Let it also be known that you really do not have to order a full-course meal to enter. Do what you want, whenever you want. No such thing as out of place. Go in like you own it—with a hint of class.

Just wanted to make this ’cause a majority of my friends are intimidated by fine dining restaurants, and it’s really not—and to also just showcase the resto.

If you have any questions, I will try to answer them!

3rd Burnt Butter, 4th photo Onyx Cube Steak.  
Really good.

This sub has been super helpful and it is payback time.

Background: I am a successful entrepreneur and business has grown into a 7-figure salary. Family of 4 has nice house in suburbs of big city, 4 acres, etc etc. We also have a ski condo. 

Last year my son got into a competitive snow sports program that required a parent (me) to move to our ski condo for the winter. My ex wife thought it would be a good time to put a $600K addition onto the house which I let her manage while I was in Vermont. She brought our other son 3 hours to the ski condo almost every weekend. We had what I thought was a normal 20-year relationship. Some fights, some disagreements. But sex was consistent, we were good partners and great parents.

After the season ended, I returned home and literally the way home from the airport with kids in the car, some sexts from the contractor start showing up on the screen of the car that my wife forgot to disconnect. My son read them to me ""Bathroom sneak, Bedroom sneak, love, etc"" while we were driving. My blood went cold. 

I went into complete shock and asked to see her phone to gather the context of these text messages. She got cagey and was deleting things but then handed me the phone. There wasn't anything with the contractor but I opened Instagram which had plenty of very inappropriate conversations. Enough that I knew there was an affair, whether it was emotional or physical, I wasn't sure. 

I don't remember the rest of the ride home and the kids knew something was way wrong. When we got home, she and I went into the bedroom and started discussing what happened. At first, I got the ""it isn't what you think, we were just joking"". I looked into her eyes as she lied and she was more animal than human, unable to admit what I saw with my own eyes. 

I had suspected her and the contractor had a too close relationship for months. I'd catch her talking on the phone with him and she was talking to him like her mom about things that had nothing to do with our home renovation. The gaslighting was already months old. Even the kids would ask her why she was sending pictures of them to the contractor and of course she gave them their first lesson in gaslighting.

Because this contractor was also months late on our home renovation (I wonder why?!) we were living in our cottage. Our kids could hear the conversation we were having. We scheduled an emergency meeting with our marriage therapist we hadn't spoken to in a few years. The kids wanted to know what was up. I told her she had to tell them what happened or I would. She admitted that she was having an affair with the contractor. The older son and I cried. They wanted to know why this marriage that hadn't had any noticeable fissures was blowing up.

My oldest son, unbeknownst to us, called up his friend from school who he was in AP chemistry with, to tell her that her dad (AP - the contractor) and his mom were having an affair. Another family nuked. Her mom/his wife called me an asked if it was true and if she could see the texts. At that point, I had the last week's of text messages which hadn't been deleted from her phone. 400 pages of text messages in 7 days. They were texting non stop and that didn't include snapchat and instagram messages!

The files of texts were so big that they couldn't even be emailled and I had to share via Google Files. She thanked me and was off on her own story. I tried to sleep that night but I couldn't. Somehow she was able to sleep in our bed. I woke her up a few times to ask her WTF. She (alligator tear) cried and said we should go to therapy.

She moved out in the morning at my request. I stayed with the kids. At first she stayed with a mutual friend and then moved into a hotel. We saw the therapist 1st thing on Monday morning. 

The therapist asked all of the questions you would expect: Is this affair worth blowing up a 20 year marriage, that up until that point, hadn't showed signs of big trouble? Why did she seek validation from the contractor. Do you see a future with him or your family? All of these things. She admitted that she had fallen for him, especially his, what I would later learn was, love bombing. 

The therapist said this was a critical juncture and that we both needed time to de-escalate. Therapist said I shouldn't make a decision about leaving for a few weeks at least and that my ex should go no contact with the AP/Contractor. We both agreed to do this.

At this point, my mind was shifting wildly between divorce with prejudice and reconciliation. As I put it at the time with friends, my mind would never be able to get over this but my heart would never get over her so I had to try. My oldest son made me promise to try so I at least would go through the motions. That week she was going to work and living in the hotel. She would stop off at home to see the kids. We would talk. 

On Tuesday, the AP's wife called and told me that had spoken on the phone even though they both promised to go no contact. I confronted her about this and she denied it at first saying I had control of all of her devices. She later admitted she had talked to him on her work phone but it was just to tie up loose ends. 

Later that week after a few drinks with commiserating friends nearby, I decided to visit her at her hotel. I called her cell phone on the way there and she didn't answer. I called again and as I was pulling into the hotel, she picked up the phone sounding very strange. As I pulled in next to her car she could hear her car unlock knowing I was there. She started screaming, ""you can't come in"". I asked why. She said that AP was there.

At that point, I shut down. I sent a few nasty texts as I drove home calling her a whore and that it was over and we were now going to be at war. I started asking around for lawyers. One of my friends was 2 years into a nasty divorce and his lawyer was a psycho. Hired the next day. He told me I would know when she hired a lawyer because she would try to get back into the house.

For the moment, her and AP moved into a spa and were living their best lives together without families to think about. This went on my credit card but she promised that AP would pay us back. You can guess how that went.

At this point, I wasn't eating much and dropping lots of pounds. I wasnt fat but people were already starting to notice that I looked like I lost weight and more than one person said I looked shell shocked. My friends who were affair victims both told me that besides having a lawyer, I now needed to own the narrative. I started telling all of our friends what really happened. She had already started telling friends that we had been over for years and this was just her moving on. News to me!

In retrospect, I probably didn't need to reach out as far as I did. This is the kind of salacious story that has its own legs. And, of course there's another nuked family in town also spreading the same news. 

Like clockwork a few weeks later, she got a lawyer who advised her that not only did she need to get back into the house, but if she was going to have any hope of staying in the house, she would have to accuse me of some sort of domestic violence. Being the techgenius that she is, she left that email from her lawyer up on the computer screen for me to see.

We were prepared and by that time, we were back in the main house. My lawyer said that we could give her the cottage and not lose domain rights to the main house. She moved in and her mother soon moved in there with her.

I shaved my beard and continued to lose weight. Therapy with our old marriage therapist was great because she knew exactly the person I was getting over. I had also started going to the gym to lift heavy weights religiously. So much so that I couldn't even take a day off.  I was starting to get looks in town and my friends would often not recognize me right in front of their faces. I started taking pictures of myself and built a dating profile. My sorrow was shifting to anger and that felt so good.

My first dates were 45 days after the affair was discovered. I linked with a few interesting girls. I started conversations with them and things went OK. I found out pretty quickly that exactly no normal women were interested in having a date with a guy 45 days out of an affair ended 20 year marriage. I tweeked my story. I hadn't lived with my ex wife for half a year which was true because of Vermont but not exactly right. I had the most luck on Bumble and Facebook Dating but also tried Tinder and Hinge. I paid for multiple months up front since this was going to be a process. 

My first Tinder date was with a girl about 15 years younger than me a town over. She was cute but prob too 'country' for me. We met up at a crowded bar and started to chat. There were a lot of awkward pauses. She started to talk about some conspiracy theories she had and support for the opposite political party that I supported. I left as soon as I could but did get information about her enough to figure out who she was on Google later. Turns out she had killed a motorcyclist a few years ago in her car. For all I knew she had an ankle bracelet on our 'date'. What a bad start. No more Tinder dates for me.

Luckily before the dust settled on my 1st attempt, I Bumble matched with an impressive business woman from a few towns over and we took to longer conversations about our shared religion and kids and love of dogs (cliche, I'm aware). We agreed to meet up over coffee near where she was from, a place that I was familiar with. Conversation in person was good, we had some good stuff in common. There was some laughs. I ironically felt like I was cheating on my wife. Then she asked about my ex and I felt empowered to launch into the story. I could see the fun fall off of her face, and I tried, but I just couldn't not ruin the date. I got a text later that day saying 'the timing wasn't right'. Correct!

I had a lot more conversations and a few more uneventful dates that didn't go anywhere. I met an Albanian woman who was really into me but her profile pictures were from about 10 years ago and she seemed old. I had a conversation with a widow but she was far away with a busy schedule and never found time to meet. A few other mediocre dates and some hookups happened.

Because I'm relatively successful and have an online presence, I decided to make it easy to find me if profile sleuths wanted to on Bumble. Soon after, I met a cute blond about 15 miles away. We went out on a date and were both attracted to each other. Kissed at end of first date. About 75 days after the affair reveal, I had taken home this blonde woman and was having amazing sex with her in my marital bed. She didn't know the importance of course. Ultimately, she wasn't a great fit for me and we ran out of things to talk about. 

On Facebook dating, meanwhile, I had somehow been matched with a girl from just over an hour away. Her pictures weren't polished and were somewhat pixelated. I was able to figure out who she was from some of the stuff on her profile and it turns out she was an Ivy grad school-educated girl with a lot in common with me. We commiserated about our exes. She wasn't yet divorced but about a year ahead of me in the process. We met for coffee near where she grew up - about 20 mins from my home. I told her the real truth about my situation. She told me some deeply personal stuff about her situation. No kiss goodbye but I definitely felt a connection. There were some red flags of course but we took it slow. 

I showed up to our second date in my Chevy and we walked and talked and drove a bit and I felt a connection. As she was getting out of my car, I leaned in for the kiss and she did not disappoint. It felt so good that I just didn't want to stop. After way too little time, she got out of the car and walked away. I felt something deep that I hadn't felt in forever.

At this point I should probably say I am a serial monogamist. I just can't see someone when I have feelings for someone else. I dropped contact with other prospects I had at that point including a local woman. We went out on another date. Had some drinks, walked and did lots of talking. More kisses. Luckily I had a month long trip coming up that allowed me to get my thoughts together. The Facebook woman kept in touch. we had lots of conversations while I was away. She sent me some sexy picts. I called her. She picked me up from the Airport.

I had a birthday party 5 months after the affair and I introduced her to many of my friends as my girlfriend. We had a small bump in the road right after that where I wanted to move too fast and my animosity toward my ex scared her. That was so devastating to me because of the affair trauma but I managed to keep it together and she ""came to her senses"".  Shortly after she said ""I love you"". 

But overall, things have been amazing. I'm very much in love we are slowly integrating into each other's lives. I'm trying to continue to stay slim and muscular and she's also very healthy. Much moreso than my ex. Also much more attractive and smart and funny and nice. Really the whole package. 

I'm still going thru the divorce (prob at least another year) and I keep a lot of animosity toward my kids' mom in my head at the same time as this new-ish puppy love that I have found - which is a huge mindfuck. The times where I mourn the life I lost are few and far between now and I've built the tools to deal with it thru therapy. I now worry that this great new relationship I have is some sort of rebound or that I will regret how quickly I moved out of single-hood. Friends of mine who have been divorced for years say that I'm lucky but I still worry.

So that's my year in divorce-land after a 20 year marriage. I hope this helps folks here like others' story helped me. Feel free to PM me and good luck out there!

I wake up. That wasn’t the plan. Today I was exceptionally allowed to sleep in, because I don’t have to bring the kids to school (Easter break). A missed opportunity, but I decide to wake the person next to me so that my early awakening still turns out fun.

**8:16 AM**  
Two orgasms later (not always the case, I admit) and in a great mood, I crawl out of bed. My craving for chocolate motivates me to get up. Since it’s later than usual, I decide to get dressed right away. I’m unsure about how many layers to wear. It’s probably going to be a beautiful day, but when you sit still all day in a cold house, it doesn’t feel like summer.I go for short shorts with tights and a turtleneck. ‘Easy access’ (his words) won’t apply today. I’ll ‘finish the look’ later. I head downstairs.

The next fifteen minutes are spent mindlessly scrolling: Reddit, Facebook, Insta, and dumb clickbait articles from national newspapers. I refill my sugar reserves and drink coffee that’s about 97% water and 20 granules of instant coffee. In that area, I’m pretty cheap. 🙂

**8:32 AM**  
Today is a work-from-home day.I open my screen, which is right next to me on the table, and my green dot on Teams lights up. Why are there always those overachievers who are already working hard?Outlook opens. Only three emails! What a blessing, this vacation.  
  
My +1 is on holiday and, for once, hasn’t filled my calendar with work. Usually she does, fearing that I won’t know what to do. PS: I *always* find something to do, but I guess it gives her peace of mind.I email the work I finished yesterday. A boring task: “Make a PowerPoint presentation”… (and those words already make me go: *phhhhh*). And yep, this task follows the usual pattern at our place.  
  
A project with no one taking the lead. Result: chaos.I get the briefing with, “Just make something.” So I make something, send it off, and *then* they start thinking about what they actually want.Then I get feedback, and I think: “Fuck you… again?!!!”

But that’s kind of the weekly constant as an in-house graphic designer.People love pretty things to read instead of a plain, boring file. I get it. But my time costs money, people, and I don’t enjoy doing everything twice!I sigh and get annoyed. I talk out loud to myself… some kind of processing method, I think? Either way, I calm down and proceed with attempt 7899 to convey this in a calm, communicative way. I love using the word “efficient.” It sounds like I want the best for the company and immediately gives them a guilt trip.I hope for improvement, but guess what? I’ve been doing this for 15 years, and nope. Seems impossible. 😒

Since I don’t have much deadline-driven work now, I take the opportunity to work on my ‘own project.’At the beginning of the year, I requested a ‘costly investment’ at work. I sold it as: “This will save you a lot of money.” They also love hearing enthusiasm, and voilà — my expensive five-day training got approved just like that!As the only graphic designer in the company, I always seem to be the ‘most expensive’ one. Expensive Mac, expensive trainings… I almost feel guilty asking for these things, but I really wanted this! Step one: completed.

Anyway. Figma, here I come! I’m bumbling my way through and realize that the deeper I go, the more I think… this is hard. I need more knowledge, but there’s no one to ask.I also feel like I don’t know what I’m doing, but I keep going. I even start doubting my own design skills — something I’ve never experienced before. Now I’m questioning everything.I hope Mr. or Ms. AI will give me some validation so I can hand over this project to ‘the professionals’ without shame or doubt.

In the meantime, I take a short break.

I “finish myself off.” Meaning: I brush my teeth, comb my hair, and make myself presentable for the ‘camera’ — just in case someone calls.While working, I frequently exchange glances with my other ‘colleague’ sitting right next to me. That hot thing is my so-called ‘workmate’ with whom I occasionally engage in slightly inappropriate behavior on the ‘work floor.’Uninvited, I plop onto his lap and wedge myself between him and the screen. We grope each other briefly, then get back to work. Those, I quote, “soft butt cheeks” are well covered today. The temperature in the house is too low.

**11:38 AM**  
Here we go again. An email with a question about a ‘computer problem.’Together with one other colleague, I’m the only one who “does something with computers.”  
  
Result: for every tiny computer or internet issue, some coworkers throw their hands in the air and send their questions straight to us.I read it, try to understand what they mean, and immediately feel they don’t get the concept of the cloud system.It’s a Windows issue. Lucky me. So I don’t respond.Sometimes I play dumb and say, “I don’t work with Windows.”But usually, I just send them an answer via email — with a screenshot of the first Google result.This is my way of signaling: this was a five-second Google job you could’ve easily done yourself.Guilt-tripping is kind of my thing. 😅

Still, I sometimes feel guilty myself, but I now tell myself I’m doing them a favor.I’m educating them and giving them knowledge by letting them look it up themselves. That’s how they’ll learn. 😉My colleague replies an hour later.Problem solved, and I drag the mail into the ‘done’ folder.  
  
By now, my hands are cold again.  
  
In the meantime, I randomly think: DRINK  
I need to drink water!!! I often forget.

**12:30 PM**  
Late breakfast, so hunger comes later. I hope for leftovers, but when I open the fridge, I’m disappointed.  
  
Options:

 Lots of cheese (cheese platter/sandwiches)… not feeling it. 

Cooking… (too lazy, and it’s too late anyway). 

Crap food + 3 mandatory avocados. I hate wasting food, and avocados are little jerks.

We eat in front of the TV. Now that the kids aren’t home and we don’t have to set a good example, we take advantage of it.  

We watch something light: ‘*Kung Fu Heroes’*.

**1:10 PM**  
I jiggle my mouse.  
My green dot is back.

My food has warmed me up again.

I decide to tackle a task I’ve been postponing for weeks. *Phhh.*I’m sighing a lot today.  
I decide to download stock images and do it the way I always do.  
  
AI has already wasted enough of my time!I genuinely gave it a chance, but the results were underwhelming… laughable even.That was the only good thing about losing six hours: a few solid laughs at those painful results (you know… three arms and those kinds of things).

My relationship with AI remains complicated. A hot topic these days. AI… yeah, no, sorry, it’s not going to replace my job any time soon. I’m not worried yet. Besides, AI won’t be watering the plants either.

In between, a few more emails arrive from our external IT partner.  
I gladly answer Jira tickets. While testing the website changes for the umpteenth time, I entertain myself (and probably others who see it) by inserting some playful nonsense into the test environment.  
I reply to the ticket with cheerful enthusiasm and a matching emoji to show that everything is in order. It makes work more fun, but I have the feeling I’m also getting more service than we’re actually paying for — just by ‘flirting’ a little with those guys.Their response time seems to match a higher-tier contract than the one we have. I love it.

**4:23 PM**  
I tackle a classic problem: customer complaints about our website. I usually give them the benefit of the doubt, but I can tell this is another case where the issue isn’t the website—it’s them.

**5:00 PM**  
I shut my screen.

The days tend to go differently than average. Answering emails usually eats up most of my time, leaving me with the feeling that I didn’t actually get much done. Luckily, today doesn’t feel like that. That personal project I’m taking the lead on gives me a lot more satisfaction. I’m ending my workday with a positive feeling.

Tomorrow, I’m sure there’ll be a whole new cloud of question marks floating around my head, making me wonder once again: *am I doing okay?*

1k0rubq,https://www.reddit.com/r/justcreepystories/comments/1k0rubq/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”

At home I drink Miralax in my morning coffee, take magnesium, drink 100+ ounces of water per day, take fiber gummies in addition to 25-30 grams of dietary fiber, eat lots of fruit and veggies (bulk), get 10k steps/day, take a probiotic, all the things to try to stay regular, but it's a constant battle and I almost never feel ""empty"". I occasionally use Mag07 if I'm particularly backed up.

I'm on vacation and having two gloriously large poops per day, without my Miralax, not drinking enough water, hardly touching a vegetable. I'm curious what the contributing factors are - maybe more fat lubricating things, less protein binding things up, and maybe some alcohol helping move things along? Wish I could have this success when I'm at home eating nourishing food. Sigh...

Please read :),"Hi there, 28F located in Kuna (willing to drive anywhere from Caldwell to Boise and anything in between, minus crazy distances like Emmett) looking to join a campaign (new or established) that meets twice a month. 

I’m not looking to join a campaign that is hosted at a game store. Loud shenanigans are great and I love that, but not when multiple tables are sharing the same space and I therefore hear *everyone’s* loud shenanigans! I’d love to join a group that meets in someone’s home. 

I met my most recent/previous DM (who had a change in work schedule and responsibility and had to stop running a table) publicly in a coffee shop to get a feel for if we (my husband and I plus his partner and their friend) would all get along well. This was after a bit of messaging back and forth to go over the campaign, group details, expectations and the like to make sure I was a good fit gaming/experience wise for their table. My husband joined later but he might not join a new campaign due to work and school—it would also depend if you have space for 2 more. But my schedule is much more free than his, so I am very serious about finding a group! 

I’d love to join under a DM that has either played D&D for a very long, or has DM’d at least once before. I love home brews but am fine with joining non-home brewed campaigns as well—to be honest, I’m looking for an animated group! Where people are comfortable with active role playing and not just monotone “He did this. And said that.” unless that’s their character personality, if that makes sense? The amount of people playing D&D that don’t actually “role play” during a game is probably few but I’ve come across some in my short time playing. I wasn’t in that campaign but I observed it and it was boring. Lol 

Anyway—I don’t have a FB nor do I want one, and you can’t access people on FB without an account and a messenger, which is why I’m putting this out here! I do have Discord as well if you and your campaign members have one where you post! ",0,1744828481.0,Boise,6,0.5,False

My dogs were with me, I picked my purse up with my keys in it and I remembered oh I can't leave them  in the car it's too hot.  I set my purse down, shut the door and ran around to the other side of the car and then I remembered I had already locked the door to the car and now my purse was locked in it and I couldn't open the door. So I ran in the house ran to the bathroom and then I asked my dad when I was coming out if he had a hanger because I accidentally locked my dogs in the car and I needed to open it so he said sure,  so he took a hanger I took a hanger and we went outside, we worked on trying to open that door for  45 minutes and then he said why don't you call the non-emergency police department number and see what they say. So I called them and they told me that I have to call a locksmith because if they weren't children  they couldn't come , I said okay. So we worked on it some more with the hangers, but every time we put the hanger in the cracks of the window it always shot to the middle of the car no matter what side we tried it would keep shooting to the center of the car no matter what side of the door we put the hanger in. So my dad started looking for a locksmith then I thought to myself , wait a minute, wait a minute ! I shook myself and I said I'm a child of the most high God . I said father send an angel down here in this car and when the hanger goes to the center of the car  have him take his finger and push it over to the lock.   I said thank you Lord , so I waited one minute and then I said, okay Angel I know you're there I put the hanger through the crack of the window and it shot to the center of the car and then I watched it slowly move from the center of the car, between the driver and passenger seat across the driver's seat all the way to the lock, I pulled on  the hanger and it slipped off. So I said I'm sorry Angel I need you to do it once  again, this time hold your finger on the hanger so it doesn't slip off . so I put the hanger in there once again and I saw the hanger move all  by itself in slow motion from the center of the car pass the drivers seat to the lock and it was placed right on the lock and the angel held it there and I pulled it open and I got my dogs out!

Lately, I’ve been feeling *extremely* dumb. Even normal tasks feel difficult, like they require way more mental effort than they should for average person. 
  

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve struggled to form sentences when speaking. I can’t think of responses quickly—it’s like my mind goes blank. *This happens less with my parents now, but with friends or others, I often feel ""weird.""* People have trouble understanding me, and I have to put in *a lot of effort* to understand them. It’s always been this way.  

My brain feels *constantly* cloudy, like everything in my head is scattered and disorganized. Growing up, I was terrible at studies. *Here’s how it worked for me:* If someone in my class put in 100% effort, they’d get 100% results (or maybe lower if they were careless). But for me, even with 100% effort, I’d only get 70-80%.  

Studying was torture. *I’d read the same page over and over* and still not grasp it. Every time I got something wrong, my mom would get so angry she’d hit me very hard. This happened daily from kindergarten until 6th grade.  

There was *just one time* when my mind felt clear and organized, it was through some strong coffee that I can't somehow replicate now, I actually understood something from the book easily. I wish I could feel that way again. *Unfortunately, therapists and psychiatrists here are not good, and I can’t afford better options.
