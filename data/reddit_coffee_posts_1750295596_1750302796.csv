1lf0f45,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/1lf0f45/i_followed_your_advice/,I followed your advice,"Well, I'll tell you a little about my experience because maybe someone feels the same or something similar happened to them. I am 20 years old (soon 21) and I am still a virgin, without a partner, without kisses, without anything that seems so natural to everyone. But that's not what weighs me most. What bothers me is having really tried... and that every time it ends the same: in nothing.

But hey, I followed their advice to lose my fear and after chatting, try to ask them out.

The thing was like this:

+ I invited a girl from university (a classmate who I thought was pretty) several times. I got nervous, I sent him the message... and nothing.

+ I invited another classmate with whom I had studied a few months ago and we were texting, I cheered up despite the fear... she ghosted me directly.

+ I invited another girl who left university but I kept in touch, it even seemed like there was good vibes. She ended up inviting me first, but it was in the absolute friend zone.

+ I invited someone I met on Instagram, she chats well, she's cool, I invite her... ghosting again.

I invited the last one, I met this one 1 week ago, with whom I chatted very well, we even managed to get her Instagram. I invite her to a coffee… I ghost the same.

And yes, clearly the pattern repeats itself. I'm not crying because of rejection. I am sharing the frustration of having tried it many times, and that the result is always the same: silence, emptiness, “nothing happened.”
The craziest thing is that I speak well, with respect, without strange intensity. And it's not that I stayed in theory: I took the step. And still, nothing.

Maybe someone tells me: “wait, it's coming”,
but the bottom line is that it's tiring. Because you want to see even a small result after trying so much.

That. I wanted to share it because I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.
And if anyone has something to tell, reading them would make me improve.

I went about 5 days without caffeine 2 months ago and I felt so clear-headed, but I still hadn't been working on my depression.

Lately I've been feeling really great with my new medications and supplements. I think I'm finally ready to quit caffeine. I'm very into holistic and green psychiatry + medicine and I believe that the general consensus among those communities is that at least for some people, it should be considered that it might be a good idea to eliminate caffeine completely from the diet.

I go through several different moods and sets of feelings in the same day. I believe that the fluctuating moods could be caused by the caffeine. As I've been increasing my meds + supplements I've been noticing the caffeine is less and less vital to my daily routine, and now I'm thinking maybe I'm finally ready to ditch it.

I'm going to record several clips of aspects of my daily medications/substances/supplements/food+drink, routine, tomorrow. I'm hoping that in doing this I can give myself the motivation to remember that I have the other tools and coping skills to get through my day without caffeine. It's been affecting me for so long and i KNOW it isn't healthy.

I think I've got the motivation to do this. I just have to be on the lookout - no iced tea (except green tea extract [supplement] with negligible amounts], no coffee, no mountain dew, no chocolate (except cocoa powder supplements with negligible amounts), no supplements with caffeine, no otherwise caffeinated soda. And if I'm trying a new soda of any kind always check to make sure there's no caffeine.

Not the kind of tired that a cup of coffee or a night’s sleep fixes. No, I’m talking bone-deep, soul-rotted, heat-choked exhaustion. The kind that clings to your skin and whispers in your ear, “This city doesn’t want you anymore.” And maybe it's right.

I lit a cigarette, third one this hour, and leaned against the hood of my unmarked ‘98 Crown Vic. The summer sun beat down like a punishment, making everything—garbage, pavement, breath—smell like hot meat. New York in July. Like hell forgot to pay the A/C bill.

They called me Frankie D’Angelo. 26 years in Homicide. I’ve seen bodies left in dumpsters, bathtubs, park swings, even once folded into a goddamn washing machine. But nothing—nothing—like this bastard.

They called him The Smiler.

At first, the papers tried cute nicknames. The Happy Slasher. Mr. Grin. I didn’t laugh. You don’t laugh when you find a woman on a subway bench with her lips sewn into a grotesque goddamn smile, a chunk of her tongue placed in her own lap like a garnish.

Three bodies. Three weeks. Always posed. Always smiling.

We didn’t know if it was thread or wire he used. Didn’t matter. It held. He made sure it held.


---

July 14th. 104 degrees in Queens.
Another body. This time a street magician named Rico. They found him inside a run-down magic shop, slumped against a wall of dusty top hats. His mouth sewn just like the others. Smile like a jack-o’-lantern. Eyes wide with terror. Only difference? The Smiler left us a message. Carved right into Rico’s chest.

“You see the world how it is. I show them what it can be.”

I stared at the words until they burned into my brain. Then I walked outside and puked into a trash can. My captain—Burtino, a real asshole with a hairpiece you could land a plane on—told me I was too close. Said I needed rest. I told him I’d rest when The Smiler was six feet under with a smile of his own.

He didn’t like that. Wrote me up. Again.

July 20th. 108 degrees in the Bronx.
Sweat poured down my spine like molasses. My suit clung to me like regret. We got a lead. Guy named Ellis. Homeless, lives under the BQE. Says he saw a man dragging a body bag into an abandoned factory near Hunts Point.

I found Ellis sitting under a bridge, shirtless, eyes cracked like desert stone.

""You Ellis?"" I asked.

He nodded, real slow. Like the heat cooked his thoughts.

""You said you saw something.""

“I seen him, man,” he said, voice raspy like gravel. “He hums. Real soft. Like a lullaby. Had a needle in one hand. Big smile on his face. Like he was proud.”

I knelt down, looked Ellis in the eye. ""What song was it?""

He thought. Then he hummed a few bars.

“If you’re happy and you know it…”

My blood turned to ice in the inferno. I knew that tune. My daughter used to hum it. Before the cancer. Before I buried her.

I stood, lit another cigarette, and told Ellis to stick close. Gave him twenty bucks. He cried. First time anyone paid him to remember a nightmare.


---

July 23rd. 110 degrees. No wind. No clouds. Just pain.
I broke into the factory at dawn. Didn't wait for backup. Couldn't. I had this fire in my gut, and it wasn’t just the bourbon from last night. I knew he was in there.

The place stank of rust, piss, and something else. Something sweet. Like rotting fruit.

Then I heard it.

“If you’re happy and you know it…”

Soft. Echoing off the broken walls. I followed it through the shadows, gun drawn, heart banging like a war drum.

That’s when I saw him.

He was crouched over something. No, someone. A young man. Hispanic. Still breathing. Barely. The killer was threading a needle with surgical precision, humming like a goddamn bedtime story.

I raised my gun.

“Freeze!”

He didn’t move. Just kept sewing. Slow. Deliberate.

“I said freeze, motherf—!”

He finally looked up.

And Jesus Christ.

He wasn’t what I expected. No monster. No beast. Just a guy. Late 30s. Clean-shaven. Handsome, even. Like the type you’d hire to babysit your kids or host a game show. His eyes were the dead giveaway. Wide. Empty. Like TV static.

“You’re interrupting my art,” he said.

His voice? Calm. Teacher-like. Polite.

I moved closer. ""Let him go.""

“You don’t get it,” he said, rising slowly. “I free them. I give them what the world won’t. A smile. Forever.”

I felt something in me snap. Maybe it was the heat. Maybe it was years of seeing the worst of humanity. Or maybe it was because this man was trying to give the world the same smile my daughter had… before the chemo took it from her.

“You’re sick,” I said, stepping forward.

“No,” he whispered. “I’m necessary.”

He lunged. I fired.

Bang.

One shot to the gut. He stumbled, but kept coming.

Bang. Bang.

Chest. Shoulder.

He dropped the needle. Still smiling. Still humming.

Bang.

Right between the eyes.

He collapsed like a marionette with its strings cut.

Blood pooled around his head in a thick, black halo. His face twisted in something that almost—almost—looked like peace.

July 24th. 102 degrees. Brooklyn.
The papers screamed about the hero cop who stopped The Smiler. They used my name like it meant something.

Frankie D’Angelo.

But I didn’t feel like a hero. I felt like a man who stared into the void and flinched.

I visited the boy we saved. His name was Marco. He couldn’t talk, not yet. But when I walked in, he looked at me with eyes full of thanks and terror. And he tried to smile. Not sewn. Not forced.

Real.

I smiled back. Best I could.

As I walked out of the hospital, the heat hit me like a punch.

But for the first time in a long time… it didn’t feel so heavy.

Some men bring smiles into the world.
Others fight to keep them real.

Me?

I light a cigarette, look this city in the eye, and say:

“Not today.”

Foot traffic is low, but there are no options of this nature in walking distance in this area.

Here’s some specifics:

- The location I’m considering is a small strip of 4-5 storefronts. There is a convenience shop, and a restaurant that appears to have replaced another restaurant fairly recently. The food is great (went recently). The other storefronts are all shuttered businesses.

- The surrounding half mile radius is residential, which is then surrounded by two large middle schools, a large retail/chain shopping area with a big grocery store, and quite a few large commercial spaces (think mechanics, warehouses, etc). There’s also low income housing. There’s a Dunkin’ Donuts/starbucks/panera nearby; not walking distance, but close.

- I would consider this neighborhood very prone to gentrification (saying this as someone who grew up one town over). I think it’s going to change substantially over the next 5-15 years.

- This is not a heavy foot trafficked area. It has some foot traffic due to the schools and transit nearby. But not a main square type of area.


I’d love to hear from people who run cafes, smoothie/juice bars, coffee shops etc what you think of an idea like this. I would focus on marketing to the immediate neighborhood with physical menus and coupons, build a good relationship with the restaurant next door (encourage folks to eat there/they encourage folks to get a drink from us), maybe even offer small business owner discounts since there’s a ton of different small business nearby. It’s a working class and heavily immigrant neighborhood is why I am focused on smoothies and juices. I don’t want to bring a hipster vibe at all to this area, especially as a local; more of a healthy, no frills, value focused option for my community.

Something to note too is it’s in a bit of a dead zone considering how many chains and businesses are only less than a mile or so away. There’s only like 2 restaurants that are walkable to the neighborhood,  and no local drink spots at all as far as I can tell (not even coffee).

Just not sure if the challenging criteria could make it difficult to be successful. Thank you for reading.",1,1750301674.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

Just to clarify upfront: I’m not technically an ex-Mormon, since I was never baptized and don’t plan to be anymore. But I got pretty close. This is the only place I can think of for advice anyways too.

My best friend has been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints her whole life. When she moved here, she was kinda shy and I asked her to be my friend ykyk. We got close in school and I invited her over to my house, she came over and we had some coffee, I remember her saying “I can’t have that” and I was like “why’s that?” And then explained that she was Mormon, I thought that sounded cool and didn’t think anything n else of it for a while but then I got invited to a stake dance, and I really enjoyed it. Then I started going with her to the Wednesday night Young Women’s activities, mostly as a way to spend more time with her and learn more about her faith since I was kinda clueless. At first, it was just for fun, but I gradually got more curious and started paying attention to what they were teaching in the mini lessons. I eventually asked if I could go to their Sunday “sacrament” service, and I was surprised by how interested I was in the talks and lessons, but obviously I couldn’t take the sacrament but I was silently hoping I could one day. It felt like something I’d never had, and they told me it was then ”spirit” I believed them and I came back the next week and my friend gave me a copy of the Book of Mormon, and they told me to start reading and then pray about if it was true. I started reading it, but I didn’t really understand what I was reading and I didn’t get the feeling from the sacrament, I prayed anyways and got that feeling again like the first “sacrament” meeting so I believed it was true. That’s how they set me up with the missionaries, they had all of their lessons and I was really invested. They got to their lesson about baptism and they were trying to persuade me to get baptized as they apparently always do and I was really excited and wanted to so bad but told them I’d need to talk with my family. I did, and they said blankly “no” and I told the missionaries that but they told me that my parents need to pray harder and they are stopping me from my faith or something like that. I kept going for a while but then I just stopped because of some family issues that conflicted with Sunday’s meetings, I get at least five messages a week asking when I’ll come back and if my parents will agree for me to become a member and how my friend misses me!! and I also learned a lot about them and that’s even more why I am fed up with it! I still really want to be friends with them but the missionaries always use her a guilt trip and I think she’s okay with I don’t even know!! What do I do??

But I had switched trades due an injuries. It’s a Rceme course. Before coming out here I had asked everyone in my unit what to expect and they had all said it’s like a coffee course. The biggest one I was looking for was if it would make my injury worse well it’s still healing. They said I should be ok and the hardest part would be the field part but nothing like the infantry or artillery. My other courses i have been really good so fair that I haven’t had to worry well being in the trade and I haven’t not rehurt myself with them. But for some reason this course has been so much worse. Within the first week we had been jacked up so much it looked like a bmq and talking to the other people in the building they are comparing it to that. We are constantly running around. Throw out all of this lots of use feel like it’s bmq, we have gotten into the swing of it but something doesn’t feel right with this. After the first week of use getting jacked up for one thing and constantly feeling like we are walking in egg shells I had contacted my change of command and they had said they’d look into it. Half way throw the second week things calmed down but still felt very tense. What is worrying me is the field right now. Normally more than happy to go out and have fun no matter what it is. Call me crazy for that. But not this course, I can even say I was excited on bmq for it. All we have heard from staff is now shitty the field can is and what they plan to do to use. Lots of time we overhear them talking about the things they plan to do as well as what they get to have but we can. I know out in the field we play the game but overhearing what they get to have and how we are kinda trapped almost seems like bragging. We are also out there for 10 days as normally I hear the field being 3-6 days. I do understand we have ranges to do and other stuff but it doesn’t really make any sense. There is also a few other thing that just done add up with this. I guess this biggest question in all of this is should I prepared for this? Is this normal for these kind of courses.

This is actually just for me. It popped into my head and I have this thing where I don't really give myself time to think, and maybe if I keep setting aside a little time for that, it'll be easier to sleep at night without 900 things popping into my head. 

Anyway if you're still here, you might've read that title and thought to yourself, *Well of course you did.

I can't always figure it out, and I am guilty of referring to myself from third person. But never in front of other people, obviously. There you go hahaha, now you have another one of my biggest secrets.

But hear me out because I actually have a very specific poem in mind, one that I came up with around three years ago. It was supposed to go in my sketchbook with a cool drawing. I have a drawing for it, but it's not good enough and I really wanna redo it. 

Anyway it's pretty short and I've memorized it. I'm gonna admit that I still don't always understand the difference between poetry and prose (I'm pretty sure I've got it figured out, but I'm also stubborn and tend to be resistant to things.) 

Anyway I don't know why that's relevant, because I'm near positive this would count as a poem: 

At last, Spring has come.
and as the flowers bloom,
vines twisting and turning
through the cracks and crevices
of my heart
Suddenly I bleed color.

Wooo I don't know if the formatting will look right. Oh well. Anyway yeah, the meaning's kinda layered. There is some trauma and silliness in there, but it's also just kinda about getting better, I guess. It stinks, but I guess things always get worse before they get better. Not that things are bad now, lmao I'm pretty sure we're passed that. 

So like, this popped into my head when I think about yesterday. I decided to walk home from the gym. Even though I always talk about how close I am I've never actually taken the time to walk instead of taking a bus or getting a ride.  It'll take some getting used to, but I'd like to do it more often. 

I don't know. The world feels so big,  and in comparison I still feel so small. And vulnerable, too, sometimes, I guess. But the colors are so vibrant, and it's crazy how many things I've never really paid attention to, like the Thai restaurant on the corner, or that coffee place that I'm just *dying* to try. Ooo I wonder if the Thai place has beef salad. I think it was back when I took 311, I was buying that stuff nearly everyday. I was so mad when that spot got closed. 

Hmm in other news, my brother got a cat. A kitten, actually. So tiny, only five weeks old. Probably not a wise decision,  since we have three dogs. Also caused a huge fight in the family. The kitty is confined to his room. He's such a smart, cute, and intelligent baby. I think you would appreciate his name. Dewey.

Okay, that's just his nickname. Dyl actually insisted on giving him a much longer, more elaborate,  weird name. I don't even know how to spell it. And according to him, I'm horrible at pronouncing it too. It's five names total. Super excessive. I should tell him that he needs to add sir to the beginning. 

Okay me sleep now, byeeeeee

1lezpke,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1lezpke/my_first_divine_liturgy_experience_was_awful/,My First Divine Liturgy Experience was Awful,"A few weeks ago I (22F) attended my first Divine Liturgy in a Greek Orthodox Church. I felt like I had to at least try it if I want to be saved.

I wasn't really excited. I felt sick and worried for some reason. I don't have any ill will towards Orthodoxy at all. In fact, I respect it deeply and I'm always eager to learn about church history because of Orthodoxy.

I attended alone and sat in the back. I was one of the only non-Greeks in the service. I was surrounded by families and couples while I was the only one alone. I barely understood a word that was being said. It was a mix of Greek and English, but I struggled to understand what the priest was saying. It wasn't his fault, I think I was just too far in the back.

I stayed for the whole service. I stood and sat when everyone else did. I crossed when everyone else did. I prayed when everyone else did. I didn't partake in the Eucharist. I really wanted to though. I want to experience being in communion with Jesus Christ.

I didn't feel anything special during the chants. The icons were terrifying. I struggled to keep up with doing the cross signs with everyone else. I was constantly confused and felt so out of place. I didn't feel like I belonged there. I tried to connect with God. 

I left after the service. There was a coffee hour or something but there were just a bunch of families huddled together. There wasn't a place for me, so I didn't stay.

I tried to enjoy it. I just couldn't. It wasn't the Church's fault at all. Nothing resonated with me. I feel awful for feeling this way. It makes me feel like I'm extremely evil or something. I'm burdened with guilt for having these feelings towards the service. I keep wondering if I've been rejected by God. I don't want to reject Him either. I want to love Him and be saved.

I keep reading everyone else's first experience and all of their testimonies are the polar opposite of mine. They talk about how they felt God right away and how it was so beautiful to them. It makes me feel even worse, like I'm the devil or something.

This didn't only happen in the Orthodox Church. It happened this past Easter at a Catholic Church too. My Catholic friend invited me to attend the Easter service and it was the first time I've been to a Catholic service. I felt the exact same way as I described before.

I'm only sharing this because I want to know if this is normal. If anyone has experienced the same thing, I'd love for you to share it with me.

I'll keep praying for God to correct me and give me a heart of flesh. I desperately want to be saved and I know I cannot be saved if I'm not connected to the Church.",7,1750300500.0,OrthodoxChristianity,20,0.89,False

Just a pinch of baking soda (less than 1/16 tsp) can mellow out the sharp/tangy edge of black coffee without having to add milk or sugar. Be careful not to add too much to significantly affect its flavor. You only need just enough to neutralize its acidity. It does make the coffee slightly more bitter, but I actually enjoy that.

Also note that baking soda can absorb the odors of other compounds which might affect the added flavor on your coffee. You need to store it in an odorless airtight container or deliberately store it with an aromatic substance like vanilla or jasmine (I haven't tried this yet. I'm not sure if it will significantly affect the flavor).",1,1750299941.0,sugarfree,3,1.0,False

Like, “held-my-hair-while-I-threw-up-in-the-Denny’s-bathroom” type of friends. I honestly love her, I really do. But she can be... *a lot*.

So anyway, she threw this little “surprise party” for me last weekend. My birthday was last Tuesday, but she insisted on celebrating Friday. She told me to dress cute, and she made it sound like it was gonna be this wholesome wine-and-charcuterie night with the girls. Sounds great, right?

Well, I show up in this cute white dress I literally bought for the occasion, hair curled, nails done, all that. I walk in and they yell surprise, but not in a “we love you” way. It was a theme party. The theme? *“Dress like the birthday girl and roast her.”* I kid you not.

EVERYONE was wearing versions of my go-to outfits. Messy bun, iced coffee cups, fake nails, bad parking tickets taped to their bags (okay that one kinda got me). But then they started doing fake ""toasts"" that were just jabs. Like:

* “Here’s to \[my name\], who always has a 10-step skincare routine but still wakes up looking tired.”
* “To \[my name\], who thinks astrology is a personality trait.”
* “To \[my name\], who ghosted her gym membership but never forgets to DoorDash McFlurries at 2AM.”

Like??? Some of it was funny, I’ll admit, but after 20 minutes it just got mean. I kept smiling through it like “haha good one” but deep down I was like... damn. This wasn’t a roast with love. It was just people clowning on me for sport.

So after pretending to go to the bathroom, I grabbed my keys, quietly told Jenna “I think I’m done for the night,” and left. I didn’t cause a scene. I didn’t cry. I just left. I texted her later that I appreciated the effort, but it felt more like I was the butt of the joke, not the guest of honor.

Now Jenna’s mad and saying I embarrassed her, and that “it was just jokes,” and I’m being “too sensitive.” A few of the others messaged me saying they thought I overreacted and that it was “all in fun.” But like... isn’t a birthday supposed to feel good? Not like a Comedy Central special?

So tell me, AITAH for walking out of my own roast disguised as a birthday party?

Also for the record, I’m now officially Team “Next Year I’m Celebrating With Pizza And My Cat.”",155,1750298720.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,87,0.99,False

if you’re reading through this, thanks for your time! it really means a lot to me
posted this here because I really want to find someone (or THE someone) out there who shares a lot of interests with me, involved in some fandoms, and maybe someone who is a little creative and likes to create, share, and write (even though this post doesn’t look the best LMAO) im looking for someone who is willing to connect and hopefully build a strong and solid relationship together!  🖤

a little about me! 🦭
- im usually online a lot, especially during the mornings in which I don’t have work but in the afternoon I will be online all of the time, i use other apps as my main methods of communication!
-i have a job as a cook, i work in a kitchen making food and whatnot so i won’t always be online 24/7 but i like to make time for people that are important! like those who like to communicate and interact 
- i love animals, especially seals! a few that I like are puffins, cats, and birds!
- im usually a very passive person who doesn’t like to initiate any sort of conflict. im not a very competitive person, i like to have fun generally! i have a lot of emotions and i like to use them for the greatest, and I like to dwell on what i am feeling most of the time instead of taking it out on something else, i like to talk about my emotions though sometimes i feel like i have a hard time expressing them, not just to myself but to other people. if you’re the type of person who is going through something, id love to listen and hear your thoughts!
- i like to party up with a few friends of mine most of the time and talk about video games and such, connecting with others and building friendships are one of the things that are the most important to me!
- if it’s okay I’d only like to share photos of me upon request! i have a pretty skinny build and i am around 6’ tall, with short-medium brown hair

things i love to do! 
- one of my favorite things to do is to write, and if you like to write too then we will get along well! i write a lot about characters from video games, sometimes from movies too. i like to be inspired by video games or movies or books and media to come up with stories for characters, i love to make lore about headcanons for characters like from some of the games down below. maybe we can share some stories of ours and write something together? 
- i like to play video games a lot in my free time, some of the games i like to play with others are fortnite and roblox, and some that are single player that i love to play are fallout, Farcry, cyberpunk, terraria, borderlands, and minecraft as well! i play on a ps5, if you were wondering!
- i love energy drinks and collect the cans as well! i also like coffee as well, a pretty tame alternative
- i love sharing memes and videos and such that i find funny, usually skits or edits!
- i love movies! probably my favorite movie of all time is tron!
i like music, I listen to bands like jungle, joywave, daft punk, and modjo 

that pretty much sums it up so if you want to send me a chat or dm feel free to message me! i can give you my socials and we will see from there!

It was made by Lane Furniture. I attached some pics because I am not too sure if there is veneer on the top of it. overall the table is sturdy.

Listed below are treatments which may have reduced symptoms during my last flare-up, as well as the list of relevant reddit posts that I'm amassing. What works for me may not work for you -- do your research first.

**current regimen:**

* vitamin D, B, taurine, magnesium, zinc, MSM, flax oil, & [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B7YNQPQ?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_6&th=1), + multiple probiotics

* I have dyshidrotic eczema, and I alternate between moisturizing and not moisturizing, depending on what seems to be working. If I'm using moisturizers, I moisturize after cleaning with manuka honey cream or Amerigel or OKeeffe.
* celery juice every morning \[per Anthony Williams -- kind of controversial but I think he has some points\]
* during active flares: eliminate alcohol, coffee, dairy, and follow diet and supplement advice per Karen Fischer \[Fischer's elimination recs will only work if the trigger is salicylates; suggested foods and supplements are still worth considering either way\]
* meditation
* air purifier
* humidifier in the winter

Between the coupon, my Best Buy Total Membership savings and a bundle discount for getting both the mouse and keyboard, I was out the door for $153.50 before tax. The mouse was $83.59 and the Keyboard was $69.91, a pretty decent little savings.

Just curious what others have tried. I recently discovered I have lipedema.  I have started the keto diet and am doing intermittent fasting. I noticed if I eat wheat/bread I am more swollen the next day, bloated, too... can't button my ""fat"" jeans, etc... this also happens with milk so I have taken that out of my coffee.  

 I currently only have compression socks that go to my knees. While they really help, I plan to purchase full stockings as soon as I have the funds.

There are two herbs that I bought and am going to start taking. I am very science driven and have been reading studies. For example, coleus forskhollii has been said to shrink fat cells. I am hoping that they will shrink lipedema fat cells. Here is a study on it:  [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8000574/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8000574/)

I also bought kudzu to try. Studies such as this one show that it reduces visceral fat in obese persons.  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22878195/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22878195/)

1leykq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/comments/1leykq4/i_feel_like_a_monster/,I feel like a monster.,"Ok in case you guys haven't read my other post here Im an adoptee and recently reconnected w my birth mom. Shes lives in NY where Im going to school, I am struggling to make ends meet and like pay for basic stuff and she offered to pay for everything for me. For context shes BERY VERY wealthy, married has a daughter lives in a penthouse its kind of mind boggling that that woman gave birth to me and I grew up in a middle class house in Jersey. 

Anyways, after much debating I met with her for coffee and asked her about the money and her expectations if I were to take it. I made it very clear that while I am appreciative of her offering her help, and recommecting with me in general I will NEVER EVER see her as my mom and kinda hold grudges that she gave me up for adoption and that my childhood would be better if I hadnt been discarded like garbage into a (ok loving) home that I never fit in. I also told her how I feel about her having another daughter (she has an eight year old with her husband) like Im happy for her but it kindd of hurts seeing her be a mom to somebody else and I have no interest whatsoever to be involved with her and her family. I also feel like so fucking out of place, these are people who flyr first class and go to private islands I grew up going to the lake and calling it a vacation. I dont fit in with that manicured life of hers and have seen how uncomfrotable I make her husband whos this successful guy.

I know his is wrong and unfair but hey I wanted to be honest. She, who is very composed and pretty, completely broke down snd went to the bathroom, then I followed her and the woman was like CRYING. I felt bad I never made anyone cry that hard.

Today, she texted me asking to meet again. I almost said no, but I felt bad, so I went. She brought this little shoebox with stuff from when she was pregnant with me—some diary pages, a tiny pair of baby socks, this faded hospital bracelet. It was kinda cute, I guess. She said she wrote about me a lot back then and never stopped thinking about me. I didn’t know what to say.

1leyjxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1leyjxx/do_things_that_prevent_gallbladder_issues_while/,"Do things that prevent gallbladder issues while fasting like coffee with half and half, olive oil and psyllium husk interfere with autophagy?","Hey guys, basically as the title says, but if you'd like a longer explanation see below. 

32M/6ft/245 lbs so I have a bit of weight to shed, but I have plaque psoriasis that I recently started taking a biologic for and will have to wait several months to see the results for. I've done several 7 day fasts before and periods of ADF before, but I've decided to ramp up fasting by doing one meal every 5 days for a couple weeks in order to both lose weight and get a longer benefit of autophagy to see if it helps my psoriasis. 

I could do probably do longer fasting but I'm worried about my gallbladder. In all the extended fasts I've done I started to feel pain behind my right ribcage after a few days, I'm currently 3 days into my fast now and I'm starting to feel it again. I tend to lose weight a lot more rapidly compared to other posts I see on this sub when I start to fast, and I have read that gallstones are caused more often by rapid weight loss than fasting itself. The last time this happened I started eating again and got an appointment for an ultrasound a few days later which came back negative for any gallbladder issues, though I don't know if the issue cleared itself before then when I started eating again and was too late to be detected. Or not and this pain is unrelated, but I have no idea what else it can be with the coincidental timing. I was and still am taking electrolyte salts any time I do extended fasting and otherwise feel fine during. 

So that led me to do a little research and found dirty fasting methods such as coffee with cream, a tablespoon of olive oil, and psyllium husk to stimulate the gallbladder to release bile while fasting daily to avoid issues. I understand it technically breaks a fast, but for weight loss I'm eating so infrequently I don't think it'll matter. I'm wondering about them the autophagy aspect however, will it interfere with that? I read that your body still stays in ketosis even when you're eating on a keto diet, so I'm assuming as long as I keep the carbs and sugar to a minimum I can eat however little or much I want and still reap the benefits of autophagy? Or does it work better when you consume nothing? 

Thanks for the help!

I've gotten used to it now to the point where I'm sometimes open to a second date just to see if there's more of a spark there, but I'm rarely super enthusiastic about it as I'm usually in agreement it's just a friends vibe.

I'm not sure if it just takes a while to warm up to people, but most my long term relationships were either hanging out with someone as part of a group then going on some dates which started a relationship, or meeting at a bar and then grabbing a coffee a few days later to kick things off.

I feel like with a lot of my dating app dates due to my schedules, we meet for coffee/dinner after work, sit opposite each other and there's no real opportunity for physical touch or very flirty things, so it obviously feels more like friends. I'm also very aware it's my first time meeting them, so I'm reluctant to be very forward with flirting unless there's clear interest from them.

We're looking at the Miele unit right now because the main requirement is to be able to store & use 2 different kinds of bean (my wife and I use different kinds).

I generally make a french press & store in an insulated carafe for the day, and my wife does k-cups. We'd be looking to reclaim that counter space and move to fresh ground beans for both.

I've heard to get the 5 year warranty with the Miele, which is fine, but are there other options worth exploring? Countertop is not an option because we just don't have the space. Budget is $5-6k.

I toiled in undergrad too long without direction several years ago…

My GPA was shot to hell in a hand basket 🧺…

So I eventually wanted to become a MD…

With my gpa, I would’ve had to do a full post bacc & grade replace essentially most classes that I had took…

I eventually decided on going to the Caribbean to do a AS/BS/MD program…

I would’ve been first gen doc…

Got through basic sciences and had a AS/BS through the medical school & added a bachelor degree from the U.S. that I was doing online classes while grinding in basic sciences…

I passed USMLE Step 1 back when it wasn’t Pass/Fail (got a 78 percentile & 206…perfect score was 300)…

I then started clinical sciences and got to the semester before last (9th semester) & got capped/maxed out on my GI Bill (military veteran: USMC) & private and federal loans…

I didn’t end up ever being able to complete my 10th and final Semester to get my MD…

So worked as a certified medical assistant for about 3.5 years (also had certifications in BLS/ACLS, Phlebotomy, & Surgical Tech)…

Got burned out working as a medial assistant with 90% of an MD completed & a USMLE step 1 pass…

Went to Mexico 🇲🇽 & took a coffee break from life…

Covid happened, went back to the states…

Got certified as a pharm tech and worked for about a year…

Now I’m a sub in high school and working on getting certified as a biology teacher…

I do want to go back & do round 2 and complete my unfinished business.

I have the option of ASU online for a premed bachelors that would take care of premed reqs and make them recent (most med schools want pre reqs to be within 5 years for STEM classes) & study and take the MCAt (I never took the MCAt as I went to the Caribbean and a lot of schools don’t require the MCAT).

How long do clinical hours count?

I’m aware that I have to take all my USMLE Steps (1, 2CK, 2CS, & 3) within like a 7-10 year timeframe, so I’ll have to retake Step 1 even though I already passed it.

That’s where I’m at, so fully aware that redoing all of pre-med, taking the MCAT, & putting together an application US med school applications is going to be quite the task!

I’ll keep chugging along & eventually with enough will & determination I’ll get my big adult goal of an MD/DO accomplished!

I’m on the hunt for someone who’s effortlessly cool, totally chill, and maybe just the right amount of weird.  I’m looking for a connection that feels natural, fun, and maybe a little unpredictable in the best way possible.

I’m the kind of person who jumps into random hobbies with zero hesitation, just to see what sparks joy. One month I’m teaching myself guitar riffs, the next I’m deep into brewing kombucha or trying to master origami (spoiler: my paper cranes look more like paper blobs). I pick things up fast, but I’ll admit I’m prone to getting sidetracked by the next shiny interest that catches my eye. It’s a chaotic process, but it keeps life exciting.

Friends describe me as the laid-back type, and I’d have to agree. I’m all about cozy hoodies, jeans that feel like a hug, and hair that’s got a mind of its own (I call it “organized chaos”). I stand at about 5’11”, weigh around 180 lbs, and have a medium build I'm working on.  Sarcasm is my love language, and I’m always down for clever banter or deep, thought-provoking conversations that sneak up on you. Life’s too short to take too seriously, so I try to keep things light but meaningful.

If you’re the kind of person who loves learning random skills (bonus points if they’re totally useless but fun), trading playful roasts with a side of affection, or just vibing over something hilariously dumb like bad reality TV or niche internet memes, we’d probably get along. Let’s grab a coffee, swap stories about our weirdest hobbies, or just see where the conversation takes us.

I didn't initially intend on pursuing a master's, but the opportunity sort of fell into my lap, and I was able to complete my bachelor's (english) and master's in four years. Now I'm out of school and feel like I have absolutely no idea what I should do next. I've applied to some jobs, but haven't even gotten a single interview (mostly communications/content writer jobs).
