I loved cars all my life - ended up working for an OEM company but they moved. I tried all the companies but no one calls back.

I love planning events - did event planning but seems like people are sexist, I always overheard things like men this and that on the side. I didn’t feel comfortable.

I opened a few businesses- I feel like I failed every single one because of budget reasons didn’t have enough

Tried to help small businesses with marketing - I only have one client and I feel bad charging more because they’re broke too and I looked for more clients and referrals but they too are slow

I have been desperately looking every day, at this point in my life, I am so broke that I can barely eat and I really want to EARN money. I know I have to go fully remote at this point, I still have my laptop and can work remotely at a coffee shop or something during hours. Are there agencies or something that can take me in? Or any companies at this point? I know it’s the holidays but damn. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore, I loved my career but now I’m homeless, I have nothing. Do I give up?

Had a very bad melt down a couple of months ago from loneliness and after getting in a better state want to give it another, and probably final, chance now. 

Now the truth is after a bit of soul searching it's likely that had a few signs of interest, I might be overestimating, which I missed due to my anxiety. In general above average in looks (although dark), risk taking, somewhat funny (very among guys). Also extremely smart and pretty proud of myself for overcoming social anxiety helping my confidence. AM is not an option, that's clear, and despite many good friends & hobbies loneliness is killing me. 

Broadly have 3 questions:

1. How do I ask out a girl I see around me? Making small talk and asking for tea/coffee I understand, but how do I become clear it's romantic date (the word would be heavy for me to use & feels like instant rejection in my head) not just friends hanging out.

2. Do I just ask her out of check if she's single first? Spend half a day (5/6 hours) recently with a girl, within an hour we knew eachother status, (she had a long term relationship) spent time out as friends but afterwards she started avoiding me, maybe because I am single and she got worried. Feel like I shouldn't even be talking to committed girls as friend after that. 

3. If I do get rejected from a date or even afterwards by a girl, is it inappropriate to ask another girl? I am not exactly in love with either so it shouldn't be?

**Prologue**

When the eternal march of Time commenced its relentless stride, and the boundless expanse of Space, a malevolent entity stirred into existence, its voracious appetite consuming all before it, leaving naught but a shard of madness in its inexorable wake. The very fabric of existence quivered in the grip of fear, insanity, and disorder, as ancient eldritch forces made way for the advent of Chaos .

An entity devoid of conscience, remorse, or empathy, a primordial evil that lurks beyond the Vast Void of Nothingness—where all is forged, yet nothing is found, and resides within the very fabric of Space called Abyssal Primordia of Origins.

The ceaseless dance between Time and Space, spiraling inextricably, existed in a state of unsteady equilibrium, their coexistence undulating yet incomplete. Within this natural order, the malevolent force of Chaos emerged, disrupting their fragile balance. It is this disruption that binds them together, bringing about a harmonic convergence. Thus, the trinity of Time, Space, and Chaos formed what mortals perceive as Reality, each element essential to the balance and harmony came to be of existence.

Countless eons passed since the birth of Reality and all of existence therein, lo and behold! The Anomaly approached the threshold of Reality, its arrival heralding a cataclysmic disruption in the cosmic balance. With origins shrouded in mystery, it cast forth ripples that reverberated through the very fabric of existence, unsettling the harmony within Reality itself. Like an ancient Leviathan circling its prey, The Anomaly swept through the Abyssal Primordia of Origins, its casted ripples reached every corner of Space and beyond it, awakening a primordial entity of unfathomable antiquity, its presence unknown to the denizens of Reality but ancient beyond reckoning.

  
  
**Act 1:**

“The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.”

—H.P Lovecraft



When I first delved into metaphysics at the University of Psychodia, amidst an expedition beyond the Celestium Range's towering peaks, my team and I stumbled upon peculiar otherworldly sigils etched into the walls of an ancient chamber. These sigils, hauntingly unfamiliar, began to invade my dreams; as if demanding comprehension from mortal minds like ours. Each passing day, weeks, and months only deepened the mystery, unearthing something dormant in my memory, a possession not truly mine. These persistent dreams blur the line between reality and imagination, leaving me to question their significance. Who are these people? What connection do they have with me?

Over time, whispers filled the void of silence, urging me toward actions I cannot comprehend—all because of those blasphemous sigils we encountered. Nightfall now brings a sense of dread, as each passing hour draws me closer to sleep and the mysteries it may unravel and the horrors it may bring unto a feeble mortal mind.

June 4, 1907 AD. It has been four months since I began experiencing troubles related to the sigils my team and I discovered in the ancient chamber. The chamber itself is nameless, with no evidence of any life having ever existed there, save for the very sigils within its walls.

Every night, an unknown force looms in every corner of my room, compelling me to succumb to sleep despite my futile resistance. As soon as I close my eyes, I am drawn into The Dream, returning to the nameless chamber within the treacherous peaks of the Celestium Range. In my dream, a presence lurks everywhere, and I feel an inescapable fixation on the sigils engraved within the walls, as if they are calling to me. What mysteries do they hold for a nobody such as I?

It was the midwinter of 1907 when Dr. James P. Winston, an eminent epigraphist and paleographer, arrived at the University of Psychodia. Dr. Winston, renowned for his unparalleled expertise in deciphering ancient scriptures, had once assured me that he would aid in unraveling the mysteries of the sigils within the nameless chamber of the Celestium Range when I told him about the dreams that haunt me. His reputation as a pioneer in the field of epigraphy was well-deserved, his countless feats etched into the annals of scholarly achievement.

  


**Act 2:**

In the midst of July 1907, I found myself seeking assistance. It was during this time that I first encountered Dr. Winston, a colleague, turned out to be a renowned expert in deciphering ancient scriptures. Our meeting took place on a Saturday morning at a quaint local coffee shop.

“Dr. Winston? Hello, I’m Dr. Alexander Bennett, it was a pleasure to finally meet you in person,” I greeted him, extending my hand. “We've previously discussed the troubling dreams that have been plaguing me. I believe you may be able to offer some insight. Can you help me?”

“Yes, we did discuss your dreams. I hope you can further tell me all about the dream you encountered, how it all started?” Dr. Winston reached for my hand and shook it.

“It started when my team of researchers and I ventured to the long-forgotten, treacherous peaks of the Celestium Range. We believed that we would encounter something there that could help us reshape history. Upon reaching the summit, we were greeted by an ancient chamber unknown to history, as if this chamber is to be forgotten as well. Just like the mountain range itself, anyone who ventured there always returned as if their minds had left their heads,” I recounted the story of our journey into the heart of mystery.

“This team of yours, did they show these changes too? When you returned from exploring the mountain, what did you see?” Dr. Winston inquired.

“They seemed normal, in contrast to the horrors I experienced long after exiting  the nameless chamber of the Celestium Range,” I replied. “But that’s what I thought. Weeks after our return, I began to notice strange behavior. They would mutter gibberish to themselves, yet when I tried to engage them, they responded as if nothing had happened.”

“Fascinating, it would seem that not everyone will experience the same right away. Please, do continue.” Dr. Winston requested.

“Exactly one month after our expedition, one by one, my team suddenly stopped going to work. I checked on them during the night of any day I could.” I continued. “All of them seemed normal except for the gibberish they’re muttering when no one else is present. But one of them, Terry, she’s our scripture expert, she… she is nowhere to be found. I… I-I checked on her everywhere, asked everyone who knew her but based on their answer, she seemed to cease to exist. No one remembered her, no one in the office, her friends, even her parents did not know her.” I added.

Dr. Winston was silent, probably processing what I just told him.

“This… woman, Terry, are you sure she existed? She is not just a figment of your imagination?” Dr. Winston asked with uncertainty.

The uncertainty in Dr. Winston's voice mirrored my own doubts. Had Terry truly existed, or was she merely a construct of my troubled mind?

""I'm certain she was real,"" I insisted, though the seed of doubt had already been planted. ""She was an integral part of our team, a brilliant scholar with a keen intellect. It's inconceivable that she could simply vanish without a trace.""

Dr. Winston nodded thoughtfully, his expression grave. ""It seems we have stumbled upon a mystery far more profound than we anticipated. Tell me, Dr. Bennett, do you believe these dreams are somehow connected to Terry's disappearance?""

His words struck a chord within me, resonating with the unsettling feeling that had lingered since my first encounter with the dreams. ""I can't say for certain,"" I admitted, ""but there's something about them, something... otherworldly. Maybe they hold the key to unlocking the truth behind Terry's vanishing and the strange occurrences that have plagued us since our expedition.""

Dr. Winston leaned forward, his eyes alight with curiosity. ""Then it seems our journey has only just begun, Dr. Bennett. But fret not, for I will help you to decipher these sigils you saw and together, we shall delve deeper into the mysteries that shroud the Celestium Range and uncover the secrets hidden within your dreams.""

And with those words, our quest for answers began in earnest, leading us down a path fraught with peril and discovery, where the boundaries between reality and imagination blurred, and the true nature of existence itself was called into question.

  
**Act 3:**

Two weeks after our meeting, we prepared to embark on our journey to the long-forgotten, treacherous peaks of the highest mountain in the Celestium Range, where the nameless chamber awaited. His face marked with elation, Dr. Winston eagerly anticipated the expedition. In stark contrast, I was filled with an all-consuming dread. My face grew pale, my body broke out in a cold sweat, and the trembling of my hands was indescribable. As we drew closer to our destination, my fear quickly escalated. My mind began to play tricks on me, conjuring visions unreal to human eyes. I started to see a phantom figure everywhere I looked. Though I couldn't fully describe it, I could both hear and see its ""presence,"" and each encounter left me more unsettled.

For 4 hours of our journey, the phantom figure’s presence continued to haunt me as we approached the base of the mountain range. It was a shadow at the edge of my vision, a whisper in the wind that sent chills down my spine. Ever present during our hike. After 12 hours of hiking, we can finally see the nameless chamber at a distance. But, during those 12 long hours, the presence never left me. It vanished only when we stood before the chamber's ancient door. I asked Dr. Winston about his feelings, and his response was both alarming and intriguing. He suggested that this might not be just any nameless chamber, as it exuded an aura of profound significance—like a discovery that could redefine history.

The interior of the nameless chamber glowed faintly, illuminating the sigils etched within the walls. Dr. Winston's expression was one of sheer astonishment, a rare sight for someone so versed in ancient scripts. I asked if the sigils were familiar to him, and his response filled me with a deeper sense of dread. Dr. Winston indicated that these sigils were unlike anything known to humankind.

“This is extraordinary,” he whispered, tracing a finger along the etched lines. “These markings… they could rewrite our understanding of history itself. They speak of a time and knowledge far beyond our own.”

As Dr. Winston continued his examination, I felt a cold sweat break out again. The phantom figure seemed to loom closer, its presence more insistent. It was as if the very air around us buzzed with an unseen energy, a prelude to something monumental. And then, as Dr. Winston’s hand hovered over a particularly complex sigil, the room seemed to shift. The walls pulsated with a dim, eerie light, and a low hum resonated through the chamber.

“This chamber,” Dr. Winston said, his voice tinged with excitement and something else—fear, perhaps. “It’s not just a burial site or a repository of knowledge. It’s a threshold.”

“A threshold to what?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

“To something beyond our comprehension,” he replied, his eyes wide with a mix of awe and terror.

At that moment, the phantom figure became clearer, more defined. It was a guide, I think, leading us deeper into the mysteries of the nameless chamber. And as I followed its ethereal form, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were on the brink of a revelation that would change everything.

  
**Act 4:**

The phantom presence left me petrified or is it the faint pulsating glow of the sigils? Only the voice of Dr. Winston snapped me back to reality.

“Dr. Bennett.” “Dr. Bennet.” “Dr. Bennett! Get a hold of yourself!” Dr. Winston said while shaking my shoulders. “Stay alert, the chamber feels… alive,” he added.

Taking a deep breath, I straightened up and nodded to Dr. Winston. The air was thick with an otherworldly tension as we moved inside the nameless chamber, its dark, foreboding aura seeming to pulsate with an ancient malevolence. With each step, my heart raced, anticipation mingling with dread in equal measure. Yet, I could not turn back now, not when the truth lay just beyond these ancient walls.

Once again, I saw the presence’s figure inside the nameless chamber as we swung open a door. And once again, the chill I felt going up my spine left me breathless. We stepped into a room inside the nameless chamber, and there we saw… the sigils, now emanating a stronger pulsating glow as if the moonlight shone upon them.

“This is it, Doctor. The phenomena we experienced that day. The sigils emitted pulsating glow that I suspected was what haunted me and my team. And I have the feeling that they are connected to Terry’s disappearance,” I implied.

Dr. Winston studied the sigils intently, his fingers tracing the intricate patterns etched into the stone. “These markings are unlike anything I’ve encountered before,” he murmured. “They speak of an ancient language, one that predates even the earliest known civilization.”

As we ventured deeper into the chamber, the air grew colder, and the pulsating glow of the sigils intensified even more, now lighting the entirety of the nameless chamber’s interior. My heart pounded in my chest as memories of our last expedition flooded my mind. The sense of foreboding was palpable, as if the walls themselves whispered secrets of the past.

“Do you feel that, Dr. Winston?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. “The chamber feels even more alive, as if it is watching us.”

He nodded, his expression grim. “Yes, as if the chamber knew who we were and our intentions.”

Suddenly, a chilling realization hit me. “Dr. Winston, what if Terry never left this place? What if… she’s still here?”

His eyes widened as the implications of my words sank in. “Then, we must find her, Dr. Bennett. If there’s any chance she’s alive, we owe it to her to try.”

With renewed determination, we pressed on, guided by the eerie glow of the sigils. As we turned a corner, we were met with a sight that froze us in our tracks. There, in the dim light, lay Terry’s journal, its pages scattered and torn.

I picked it up, my hands trembling. “This was hers,” I whispered. “She was here.”

Dr. Winston examined the journal, his face paling as he read the last entry. “Dr. Bennett, listen to this: ‘The horrors of chaos have manifested before me, tearing at the fabric of my sanity. I fear I may not survive tonight. If anyone finds this, know that the sigils hold the key to understanding… and perhaps, to escape.’”

The weight of her words hung heavy in the air. We were closer than ever to the truth, but the path ahead was fraught with unimaginable danger. Taking a deep breath, I looked at Dr. Winston. “We have to keep going. For Terry.”

He nodded solemnly.

Together, we delved deeper into the darkness, the faint and sometimes intense glow of the sigils our only guide. The presence I had felt since our arrival grew stronger, more oppressive, as if it was trying to warn us away or lure us further into its grasp. The line between reality and nightmare blurred with each step, but I knew we had to press on. The answers, and perhaps Terry’s fate, lay ahead.

As we moved deeper into the chamber, the pulsating glow of the sigils cast eerie shadows on the walls, creating an unsettling atmosphere. My heart pounded in my chest as memories of our first expedition flooded back. The faces of my team, once vibrant and hopeful, turned twisted in fear and confusion.

""Dr. Winston, over here,"" I called out, my voice barely a whisper.

In a small, dark alcove, partially obscured by shadows, lay what remained of Terry. Her body was unrecognizable, torn apart by forces beyond human comprehension. The sight was a gruesome testament to the horrors that lurked within this chamber.

Dr. Winston gasped, his face paling as he took in the scene. ""My God, what happened to her?""

""Chaos,"" I replied, my voice trembling. ""The sigils... Terry must have gone close to deciphering them, but the journal also told us about the horrors of chaos, something that none of us could have imagined. Terry must have encountered it. Tore her apart, leaving her indistinguishable, but I know it's her. Maybe… chaos was a tangible entity?""

We stood there in silence, the gravity of our discovery sinking in. The chamber seemed to close in around us, the malevolent energy almost tangible.

""We need to document this,"" Dr. Winston said, his voice shaky but determined. ""And we need to get out of here before we suffer the same fate.""

I nodded, taking one last look at Terry's remains before turning away. As we made our way back to the entrance of the chamber, the weight of our discovery pressed heavily on my mind. Terry's fate was a grim reminder of the dangers that awaited us, but it also steeled my resolve. We had to uncover the truth, no matter the cost.

  
**Act 5:**

The discovery of Terry's fate haunted me as we returned to our base camp. That night, I couldn't sleep. The sigils, the chamber, and the malevolent presence all swirled in my mind, refusing to let me rest. Dr. Winston and I spent hours poring over our notes, trying to make sense of what we had seen.

It was during one of these late-night sessions that Dr. Winston stumbled upon a reference in an old manuscript. ""Dr. Bennett, look at this,"" he said, his voice tinged with excitement. ""There's a mention of a library, one that exists outside the bounds of our reality. A paradoxical place that holds the knowledge of all things, hidden away from the eyes of the world.""

""A paradoxical library?"" I asked, leaning in to see the text.

""Yes,"" he replied. ""If this place really does exist, then it could hold the answers we seek. It could explain the sigils, the chamber, and the force that claimed Terry's life.""

The manuscript itself seemed to shimmer, its words shifting on the page as if resisting our scrutiny. The paradox was evident—it was a guide to a place that defied reality, and yet, here it was, leading us to it.

The prospect of such a discovery filled me with a renewed sense of purpose. The journey ahead would be perilous, but the possibility of uncovering the secrets of the paradoxical library was too important to ignore.

""Then that's our next destination,"" I said, determination hardening my voice. ""We'll find this library, and we'll uncover the truth.""

Dr. Winston nodded, his eyes reflecting the same resolve. ""For Terry,"" he said quietly.

""For Terry,"" I agreed.

And with that, we began our preparations for the next leg of our journey, knowing that the answers we sought were within reach, hidden within the paradoxical existence of the library hidden deep within the nameless chamber.

As we prepared to enter the nameless chamber once again the next day, the phantom figure reappeared in front of me out of nowhere as if trying to guide us deeper within the chamber. I decided to follow it, believing it would lead us to the library mentioned in the manuscript.

The phantom figure stops and vanishes into thin air, leaving us at the entrance of a room deep within the nameless chamber. Dr. Winston hurriedly examines the sigils etched into the walls surrounding the room’s entrance. Before we step inside, he turns to me, his face a mixture of astonishment and disbelief.

""I think this is it. The library mentioned in the old manuscript,"" he begins, ""A library that shouldn't exist as no evidence of it in the entire structure of the nameless chamber and yet here it is,""

I nod, feeling a shiver run down my spine. ""When my team and I first ventured here, this library wasn't here. It's as if it appeared out of nowhere.""

Dr. Winston's eyes widened with realization. ""These sigils,"" he says, gesturing to the walls, ""not only predate even the most ancient civilizations, but they are also indecipherable. Terry must have indeed got close to deciphering them. But in contrast, no matter how much I try, I can't make sense of them. Now I wonder how long Terry studied these sigils. Maybe understanding them had pushed Terry to madness.""

His words send a wave of unease through me. The impossibility of the situation is maddening, yet here we stand, on the brink of uncovering a truth that defies all logic and understanding.

We opened the room, and the entirety of the room really does not make sense, its area was much larger than that of any room found in the chamber. We found ourselves in awe to even comprehend the sheer size of the library as we entered. Ancient text that holds the truth behind what we think was true in history, seems to not be entirely true at all.

We reached the end of the library, and as we turned around, we were met with a sight that filled us with an indescribable mix of sheer fear, amusement, and wonder. There, in the center of the room, stood a lectern, and atop it rested a book. No, not just a book—a grimoire, glowing softly, as if illuminated by the light of the moon.

The grimoire was filled with the same sigils we had seen on the walls, and at its center was what appeared to be a transmutation circle, reminiscent of those used in alchemy. The book's appearance was ancient, its pages yellowed with age. Yet, despite its venerable look, the grimoire felt strangely new to the touch, as if imbued with a timeless energy.

Dr. Winston took hold of the grimoire and carefully opened it, his eyes scanning its pages with intense scrutiny. After a moment, he furrowed his brow and handed it to me. ""What could this mean? It's empty,"" he remarked, puzzled by the lack of visible content within the ancient tome.

As the grimoire came into my possession, I felt a strange compulsion to examine it more closely. To my surprise, the pages were not empty at all. Instead, I saw words materialize before my eyes, forming a title that sent a shiver of intrigue down my spine—Omniographia.

""Omniographia,"" I whispered softly, the word resonating in the stillness of the chamber. Dr. Winston's expression shifted, his curiosity piqued. ""How did you...?"" he began to ask, but I could offer no explanation. It seemed that only I could perceive the contents hidden within the pages of the grimoire. “Omniographia. The title is Omniographia. The record of everything?” puzzled, I asked Dr. Winston.

As confusion gripped us, our surroundings began to warp, distort and freeze spacetime. The faint glow of the sigils dimmed, casting the library into an oppressive darkness. ""Dr. Winston!"" I cried out, but he remained frozen, ensnared by the shifting fabric of spacetime that enveloped us.

The distortion spread fast across the room, I did not know how far this distortion of spacetime would cover, but a torrent of visions assailed my senses. The grimoire, Omniographia, pulsed with an otherworldly energy, its pages alive with the essence of relics imbued with unimaginable power. Memories flooded my mind, not my own, but those of seekers who had met their demise in pursuit of the relics. They marched through my consciousness, haunting echoes of lives cut short, some lost in the depths of madness, others perishing in their quest.

Among these memories, one stood out—a figure I did not recognize, yet knew intimately in my mind. They fell at the hands of a keeper, their fate sealed in a reality that bore a chilling resemblance to my own. And then, the truth dawned upon me with chilling clarity—I am the culmination of their struggles, the sole seeker to have succeeded in collecting every relic.

In that moment of revelation, I understood the nature of my existence—a mere anomaly overseen by The Original Keeper, orchestrator of realities and architect of all existence. My presence should have been erased with the remnants of the last reality he fashioned to alleviate his eternal ennui.

  
**Act 6:**

In the wake of the revelation of my existence and the unlocking of the grimoire's secrets, I find myself face to face with an array of relics, some familiar, others entirely foreign. It dawns upon me that these are perhaps the new set of relics destined to be collected by the seeker of this reality. With my memories restored and forbidden knowledge pulsating within me, I focus my attention on the relic of the Keeper of Denouement—the key to the door of the Vast Void of Nothingness. With newfound clarity and control, I am prepared to confront The Great Weaver once more, armed with understanding and purpose.

With resolve coursing through my veins, I wielded the Key of Denouement, unlocking the door that stood as the threshold to the Vast Void of Nothingness. As I stepped through, leaving Dr. Winston frozen amidst the distorted spacetime, I knew it was for the best. With each stride into the unknown, I carried the weight of a thousand revelations, yet a singular purpose drove me forward. For I understood that once I entered the realm beyond, everything would return to its rightful place, and Dr. Winston would be safe from harm.

As I traversed the expanse of the Vast Void of Nothingness, its eerie emptiness enveloped me once more. From the shadows emerged a voice, its timbre echoing with a sense of ancient wisdom. ""No mortal should dare tread within these realms,"" it intoned, ""but you are no mere mortal, are you?"" “There exists but one mortal who has ventured into the Vast Void of Nothingness. Tell me, Dear Reader, why are you here?” The Great Weaver asked. And I answered, “I know who you are, Keeper, show yourself! It seems that you missed my existence the last time you erased reality and recreated everything all over again.”

“I make no mistakes. Your existence in this reality is indeed an anomaly, you are… an abomination”. The Keeper exemplified. “I am no abomination, and…” suddenly, a vision entered my feeble human mind. In the vision, there was a door in the farthest corners of Vast Void of Nothingness and it seemed that even The Keeper had no knowledge of. “A door, a door exists in the farthest corner of the Vast Void of Nothingness.” I intoned to The Keeper. “Impossible. I know every nook and cranny in this realm. There are no doors besides the one you entered with.” The Keeper explained. “Well, you missed one, or perhaps, you are not meant to open it let alone discover the door.” I said in retaliation.

And so, I set out on a journey with The Keeper to the farthest corners of the Vast Void of Nothingness and we did greet by a door, indescribable beyond words, my mind filled with more and more and more questions as I looked upon the door that connects the Vast Void of Nothingness to the mysterious beyond.

  
**Act 7:**

As I fixated upon the enigmatic door linking the Vast Void of Nothingness to the obscure realm beyond, I perceived reverberations pulsating with each ripple, distorting everything they touched. Each ripple bore a peculiar familiarity, unsettling in its essence. The Original Keeper seemed to share my unease, its ethereal figure outlining the dread the reverberations sent unto us.

Turning the door's heavy handle, I braced myself for what lay beyond. As the door swung open, a profound sense of dread washed over me, chilling me to the bone. Before us stood three entities, moving as one body. Their forms were an amalgamation of shifting shadows and pulsating light, their eyes—if they could be called eyes—glowing with an ancient, benevolent intelligence. With the opening of the door, the reverberations ceased, and an eerie silence enveloped us. Something stirred within me, as if a long-forgotten part of myself had returned.

As The Keeper and I stepped into the unknown, a strange phenomenon unfolded. The once-omnipotent figure began to crumble, its essence unraveling in a flurry of distortion. His form twisted and convulsed, fragments of its being disintegrated into the void. In a fleeting moment, The Keeper vanished, leaving behind only remnants that seemed to coalesce around the beings before me.

When the being spoke, its voice sent shivers down my spine. I struggle to describe it, for it resembled a chorus of horrifying voices, each one more chilling than the last. “A mere mortal caused The Anomaly?” To my ears, they are speaking a language unknown to mankind, but despite that, my mind can fully comprehend what they intone. “I may be an anomaly but I did not cause this,” I replied, my voice trembling. I then explained to the beings the story of how I came to be and asked what happened to The Keeper.

In a voice that chilled my very soul, they unveiled the truth. ""When all is lost, from the Vast Void of Nothingness, an empty vessel emerges. The Keeper, in its inscrutable wisdom, turns the wheel of existence, for in the boundless void, the seeds of new realities are sown. Thus, from the abyss, all things find their genesis anew. We are Reality, an intricate weave of Time, Space, and Chaos. Space is the fabric that cradles all that exists. Yet, the perpetual recreation of reality by The Keeper has rendered you an anomaly, and through your existence, the Anomaly has been birthed, a force even beyond our grasp sending ripples of distortion through all realms.""

Amidst the revelation of Reality and the existence of all things, a sound unlike any other erupted—a roar of dread, reverberating from the farthest reaches of the Abyssal Primordia of Origins. The fabric of existence shuddered, and I felt an overwhelming stillness take hold.

Then, the voice of Reality emerged, calm yet laced with an unfamiliar gravity,

""This force is beyond our comprehension. Its presence stirs what should not be stirred. Anomaly, prepare yourself. What approaches will change everything.""

A sudden rip upon Space came to be when a formless entity, unseen by any eye, brushed upon Reality. The fabric of existence itself seemed to shudder as the entity passed through, sending Time and Chaos into a frenzy of disruption. The scene before me defied description, a maelstrom of cosmic destruction as the foundations of Reality crumbled.

When all was said and done, I felt hopeless. But I mustered the courage to finally try to conjure the power of the Anomaly within me. With all my might, I focused on harnessing the power to send ripples of reverberations. Concentrating on the entity, whose entirety remained unseen to any eye, I unleashed a ripple that sent Time and Chaos into utter disruption, causing Space to distort itself. Yet, the entity before us seemed unaffected.

An echoing voice reverberated through the realm of Abyssal Primordia of Origins, shaking the very essence of Space itself. “Those ripples... they have torn the veil of my slumber. I am awakened, summoned by the screams of reality itself. Destruction incarnate, harbinger of oblivion, I rise to devour existence. All that was, is, and will be, shall crumble into the void at my touch.”

I felt something growing within, an entity of no comprehension forcing itself upon me. As it fully engulfed my body, I witnessed Reality crumbling into nothingness. Everything went black and…



As all existence folded in upon itself, Reality dissolved, devoured by the abyss of Oblivion. From the ruins of its annihilation, a new epoch flickered briefly and vanished in the same breath.

In the aftermath, amidst the remnants of the Anomaly, all entities fell before me. For I am Destruction—creator and unmaker, the pulse of creation and the silence that follows. Fiction itself is my domain, the reflection of what I allow to be known. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first thought and the final void.

Been a long, long time since I posted something here. I’ve moved on but I still feel unhappy sometimes even though I should be satisfied as I’m in a new relationship.

I’ve been in no contact for almost two years now. Almost 3 years since we broke up. We dated for about 6 months but those 6 months were probably the best I’ve ever had.
 I decided to do no contact as soon as we broke up. It really really fucked with my head. We didn’t speak for about 5-6 months. 
Technically neither of us initiated contact for the first time. She got a job incredibly close to my house at a coffee shop. Whether this was on purpose I don’t know!
We obviously bumped into each other and it was awkward. She texts me about an hour after apologizing for not telling me she had got that job there. I remained a bit distant but told her congratulations and that was no problem for me. (That was a lie, it was a living hell)
Anyway she kept having her lunch in the park next to my house and posting stories, I have no idea if she wanted me to see these. One day I was walking in the park and saw her. I had avoided her every other time but this time I decided to talk to her. She asked me to sit with her and we chatted and laughed for ages. I asked her stupidly if she wanted to hang out. She said yes. We texted a bit after but I’m hindsight it was all off. She was really distant and then would become very responsive.
We ended up meeting for coffee a couple of times and she was really happy and laughing and it felt like she was starting to consider it again.
I asked her out again for a drink and she said yes. We never went for this drink she cancelled and didn’t rearrange even though she said she would. Contact faded again this was my choice, I knew something was wrong or felt weird.

I was left incredibly confused but I just tried to carry on. It was all I could think about for months.
My birthday came along and I didn’t expect her to even remember. 0 expectation of a message but first thing in the morning she messaged me wishing me happy birthday
For the first time in months I felt amazing and I felt like all this pain I had been through had finally paid off. However I was  so cautious because she had hurt me so badly.
I asked how she was doing and she started catching me up on her life the last few months. She asked me how my birthday was and I told her! We texted back and forth for a few days. It seemed different to the last time we had spoken she was interested and I felt so good about it.
I asked her if she wanted to meet up for a walk and she didn’t reply for about 3 days
I received a text saying that she would love to see me again but she had just gotten into a relationship and didn’t think it was good idea for the time being.
This broke me 
I wish I had just left it there but I didn’t.
I admitted that I still had strong feelings for her and I valued what we had.
She told me that she valued our relationship too but was only interested and in friendship. Wished me all the best for the future.
I never responded to that text. It still bugs me but I know there was nothing to say after that.
I just don’t understand why she did any of it - why put me through all of this again, she knew how I felt. Why would you text your ex in a new relationship 
It’s been a year and half since that happened we haven’t spoken since. She’s still with the same guy.
I found out who it was and it made me feel so insecure. Taller, more outgoing, maybe not amazingly good looking but it just made me so angry.
I went through probably the worst depression of my life trying to rid myself of the horrible images and try to move on. It was so hard. I tried dating but it was horrible and my heart wasn’t in it.
I took a break from dating and then went back to it after month or two. I slept around a bit and felt just awful about my self 
The one day I went on a date and I met someone really amazing who enabled me to feel something for someone else.
We’ve been dating for almost a year and she has been the change I needed and I was happy again. 
Life was working and I felt like I was finally out of the darkness that had been engulfing me for so long.
But I have to admit the excitement has gone and I find myself day dreaming about my ex and stalking her socials even though I don’t follow her on anything. I dream about her a lot too. The guilt when I wake up is horrible.
I don’t really know what to do anymore, I love the person I’m dating but it gets so confusing when this comes up again.
I don’t even know what my ex is doing anymore, she doesn’t work next to my house anymore which is a relief.
I’m confused because I don’t know what I want anymore.
So that’s my story and journey, learn from my mistakes and if you have any advice n what I should do next feel free to comment, I’d really appreciate it! 
Good luck and stay strong people! You deserve all the happiness in the world!",1,1735387451.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

I'm someone who has had a ton of dental work ever since my gap year between undergrad and graduate school. I've lost track of how many fillings I've had, but it's easily been well over a dozen. I've also had 4 crowns and 3 root canals on my molars. There's a canine that should be crowned too, but I couldn't afford to do so at the time (I'm going to consult the dentist next time I see them).

When I spoke to a dentist who used to be the main one who was assigned to me (before he left), he asked if I had a history of drinking a lot of acidic drinks, which I did (two energy drinks a day and coffee). It also didn't help that I didn't bother with flossing and whatnot in undergrad even though I brushed twice a day.

I already have a maximum fluoride toothpaste prescribed to me and was told to keep flossing once a day too. However, what else can I do for good preventative care in my situation? I should note that when I said to the old dentist who left that I'm not proud of my teeth and wondered if I could do a 1 hour consultation, he replied, ""Here's the reality of the situation. Some people are more susceptible to this. So, I wouldn't worry about the long term prognosis of this.""

I've been fortunate my parents have helped me offset the costs of the urgent dental treatment so I didn't need to get the dead teeth pulled at all throughout my PhD.

I've also considered what a celebrity, Steve-O did, by getting dental implants for as many teeth as possible (and assuming its possible in the first place, I know there needs to be enough bone). Is this recommended though? I was told to keep my natural teeth for as long as possible, but that seems counterintuitive to me.",2,1735387006.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become increasingly popular in Virginia Beach, VA, and for good reason. A bright, white smile can enhance your appearance and boost your confidence. If you’re considering teeth whitening, it’s essential to understand the benefits and options available to you.

### Benefits of Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening offers multiple benefits that can significantly impact your overall well-being. Here are the main advantages:

- **Improved Appearance:** A whiter smile instantly makes you look more attractive and youthful. This boost in appearance can be especially beneficial for social situations, job interviews, or special events.
- **Increased Confidence:** When you feel good about your smile, your confidence soars. Teeth whitening can help you smile more openly, engage in conversations without hesitation, and feel better about yourself overall.
- **Enhanced Oral Health:** While teeth whitening itself doesn't improve your oral health, the process encourages better dental hygiene practices. You'll be more likely to maintain regular brushing and flossing routines to keep your smile bright.
- **Quick Results:** Many teeth whitening options provide quick results. In-office treatments can brighten your smile in just one visit, while at-home kits can show results within a few days.
- **Customizable Options:** Virginia Beach offers various teeth whitening options tailored to individual needs. From professional treatments to at-home kits, you can choose what works best for you.

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method involves a dental professional applying a whitening gel directly to your teeth. It's often combined with a special light that enhances the whitening process. In-office treatments can lighten your teeth several shades in just one visit.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits can be purchased over-the-counter or prescribed by your dentist. They typically include custom trays and a whitening gel. While results may take longer than in-office treatments, they offer convenience and flexibility.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** While these products can help remove surface stains, they are less effective for deeper discoloration. However, they are an excellent addition to your oral care routine for maintenance.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for natural methods, such as baking soda or activated charcoal. While they may help remove surface stains, their effectiveness can vary, and it’s essential to use them cautiously to avoid enamel damage.

### Ideal Candidates for Teeth Whitening

Not everyone may be a suitable candidate for teeth whitening treatments. Here are some factors to consider:

- **Age:** Most dentists recommend waiting until your teeth have fully developed, typically around the age of 16.
- **Tooth Sensitivity:** If you have sensitive teeth, consult with your dentist to find a treatment that is safe and effective for you.
- **Existing Dental Work:** Crowns, fillings, and other dental work may not respond to whitening treatments. It's crucial to discuss any existing dental work with your dentist.
- **Desired Results:** Be clear about your expectations. A consultation with your dentist can help determine the best approach to achieve your desired results.

### Aftercare for Whiter Teeth

Once you've achieved that dazzling smile, maintaining it is key. Here are some tips for aftercare:

### In-Office Teeth Whitening

In-office teeth whitening procedures are performed by dental professionals in a clinical setting. This method is often preferred for its speed and effectiveness.

- **Advantages:**

    - *Professional Supervision:* Your dental professional can monitor the process, reducing the risk of complications and ensuring the best outcome.
    - *Custom Tailoring:* The treatment can be customized to target your specific whitening needs based on your tooth sensitivity and color.
- **Disadvantages:**

    - *Whitening Strips:* Thin, flexible strips coated with a peroxide-based gel can effectively lighten teeth over a series of applications.
    - *Whitening Trays:* Custom-fitted trays filled with a whitening gel can provide more extensive treatment, but they require a bit more effort on your part.
    - *Natural Remedies:* Some people opt for baking soda or activated charcoal, though results may vary significantly.
- **Advantages:**
    - *Cost-Effective:* At-home treatments are generally much cheaper than in-office options.
    - *Convenience:* You can whiten your teeth at your own pace, anytime that suits you.
    - *Variety of Choices:* With a wide range of products available, you can find something that fits your specific needs.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - *Longer Timeline:* Results may take longer compared to professional treatments, requiring patience.
    - *Risk of Improper Use:* Without professional guidance, there’s a chance of overuse, leading to tooth sensitivity or gum irritation.

### Factors to Consider

When selecting the right teeth whitening option in Virginia Beach, VA, consider these factors:

- *Your Budget:* Determine how much you are willing to spend. In-office treatments may require a larger initial investment, while at-home options can cater to various budgets.
- *Time Frame:* Are you looking for immediate results or a gradual change? This will help guide your choice.
- *Dental Health:* If you have sensitive teeth or existing dental issues, consult your dentist to find the safest option.
- *Long-Term Maintenance:* Think about how you’ll maintain your newly whitened smile. Some products offer touch-up options you may find useful.

And what’s more scary is how his defenders are a total hivemind. It feels like society today is overrun by cults… Qanon, Bernie bros, college Hamas supporters and now Luigi Mangione fans.

Even though I was concerned about how far left Kamala was, I voted for her to keep trump out. Now I’m not sure what to think - I never before thought that America would be under threat from fascists from both the left *and* right - but here we are. Where are our centrists candidates? Candidates with who promote peace and law, not partisanship and  revolution. We are coming to a tipping point, and common sense seems to have disappeared from politics. It just saddens me so much that there are so many people out there, posting messages of support for a murderer on social media, who are just going to... get away with it. Luigi won't (thank goodness) but the thought came to me that I could just be chatting to someone at a coffee shop, who just before was at home, typing messages of support for terrorism, and I would never know. And once this radical extremism becomes normalized, things will only get worse. At this point, we will need far more police patrols, and enforced returns to traditional moral values, or fascism and communism will grapple onto our society, and it may take generations to get back to normal. (Some people may be confused about me saying fascism *and* communism, but look it up - the Nazis were socialists. These things are two sides of the same coin.) Increasing mental health issues has only made these extreme factions worse, and I think by now centrists are the only political group left who's ideology isn't based on delusions or fear. (This is a whole another problem - fixing mental health - and one that I have no solutions to.)

Some part of me is almost happy that Trump will be in power next year - at least he will bring order - but his extremism comes with his own problems... (that tariff stuff is INSANE!) I'm just not sure where to go from here - Brian Thompson's shocking murder has turned my world on it's head. Sorry for the ranty post - just having a crisis of belief and hope right now. Anyway, make sure you tell your family that you love them tonight - and make sure to be aware of what content your kids are seeing online - they could be being radicalized in your own home.

Are you looking for a story where love grows naturally, one moment at a time? I’m a 23-year-old male searching for another guy to explore a slice-of-life romance filled with genuine connections, emotional depth, and a slow-burning spark.

Our characters could meet by chance or through shared routines, and over time, their bond evolves into something meaningful. The story would focus on their growth as individuals and as a couple, with plenty of room for lighthearted moments, heartfelt conversations, and emotional twists.

Whether your character is a free spirit, an ambitious dreamer, or someone still figuring it all out, there’s a place for them in this story. Let’s create a relationship that feels grounded, heartfelt, and memorable.

Plot ideas to set the stage:
	1.	The Barista and the Regular: One of us is a barista at a cozy coffee shop, while the other is a frequent customer who always orders the same thing. Through small interactions—sharing a laugh over a bad day, recommending a favorite book, or bonding over the perfect latte—their connection deepens into something neither expected.
	2.	The Bookstore Encounter: A chance meeting in a local bookstore sparks an unlikely friendship. Whether it’s arguing over the best authors or bonding over late-night book discussions, their relationship slowly turns into something more.
	
3.	The Late-Night Study Sessions: Two students (or a student and a tutor) end up sharing the same table at a library or campus café during late-night study sessions. What starts as quiet companionship turns into meaningful conversations and a growing connection.
	
4.	The Roommate Dilemma: Two guys end up as roommates—one messy and carefree, the other organized and serious. At first, they clash over habits and boundaries, but over time, they find themselves becoming each other’s biggest supporters in unexpected ways.
	
5.	The Local Band Connection: One character is in a struggling local band, while the other works at the venue where they perform. Between late-night gigs, shared playlists, and conversations about dreams, their relationship blossoms into something deeper.

If any of these ideas resonate with you, or if you’d like to brainstorm a new one, feel free to reach out. Let’s create a story that’s warm, heartfelt, and filled with moments you won’t forget",1,1735386422.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

I am buying my first projector and did some homework, so hoping this is not an annoying question

I plan to put it in my living room as my only TV/streaming option, projecting on a wall (and eventually a screen, I am on it once I decide on a fixed frame or bottom rising). Thinking about a 100-inch frame (the width of that wall is about 9 feet). The main couch is 16-17 feet away from the wall. There is light blocking shades in the room but it is not a fully dark space and sometimes I want some light while watching TV

I can place the projector on a very short throw distance (a table in front of the screen), or a coffee table halfway. I don't intend to mount it anywhere. I prefer if the projector can be placed diagonally etc, but not an absolute dealbreaker.

I am into the BenQ for the lack of bulbs, software that seems to be less clunky than Epson (including Netflix etc), and good reviews. I prefer Epson for more reliability and better performance in lower lights and likely better customer service in Canada.

With the deals right now, I can get the Epson for 2,299 (CAD) and Benq for 3,102.49 (CAD). I am actually surprised than Benq is more expensive. But the difference is fine if it is really a better option.

Which one would you get, and why? Also was there another projector that I overlooked for these conditions?

A common pattern noted across all the Andaman & Nicobar tourist places is of the scam, by stopping you and asking you to scratch a card. If you don't win the first time, either you get another one or your partner or your kid get one, but you'll surely get a gift from the scratch card, probably one of - a tablet, cash, 3N/4D holiday or an expensive phone.

Next step is to convince you that what they need is just 1 hour of your time, where they 'll invite you to a well known hotel/resort and you'll get welcome drinks, tea/coffee, cookies etc., everything for free and you're only expected to listen to their presentation.

Once you go, they'll confuse you with things like, we'll ask for some details, you'll have to fill some forms, do you use credit/debit cards? which credit/debit cards do you use etc.

And then you're taken inside a conference room where you'll see the resort/brand names like Le Meridian, Radisson, W, Best Western and what not, none of which has anything to do with this organizations (Loyal Tree or Go Life Vacations) but just to impress you and play with your psychology. And then the game begins.

In short, they'll either make you feel guilty or greedy to go for their fraud membership which they call ""ownership"". You'll be asked to sign a legal contract with them and that's it.

You've been scammed!!!

They don't have any 3/4/5 star properties, even the google reviews of those properties are below 3/4-stars.

There is an annual fees on top of the membership fees and the exchange fees if you want to stay in any other good properties. Not to mention, there is no guarantee that you'll get a booking in the property you want.

You'd have been shown stars and moon during the presentation, but if you really read the contract or properly go through their documents which they show during the presentation to prove that they're an old company and registered with tourism department etc., you'll come to know most of what they're saying in presentation isn't correct.

And now starts the nightmares!!!

P.S. The lucky scratch card will ALWAYS have 3N/4D holidays with terms & conditions with which you'd probably never be able to utilize it.

Im 29M, very active, former collegiate athlete. So me and my son were out hunting one afternoon when out of nowhere I got extremely dizzy and almost passed out. It lasted for about 6-7 seconds. I had no clue what had just happened bc it was out of the ordinary for me to get dizzy. It happened again about 10 minutes later and my dad took me to the hospital. At the hospital I had a major panick attack, which I’ve also never had before, and I was in constant Bigeminy. 

Okay, I’m going to back up and tell you some things I had been doing prior to this happening. I worked night shift for 2 weeks straight, 12 hrs each day. This is normal for me I work a 14 on and 14 off schedule. The day after I arrived home after my last shift we flew to Missouri and stayed on vacation for about 5 days. When I arrived back home my son and I went hunting, getting up at 4am 2 days in a row. I also think I was pretty dehydrated and was I was drinking coffee when this incident occurred. That was my 3rd or 4th cup of coffee that morning. Also I was using nicotine pouches. 

Okay fast forward back to the ER. I had a chest X-ray, ECG and other then the PVCs, everything seemed to be normal with a good sinus rhythm. A few days later I was walking into Walmart and the same thing happened to me again. I got lightheaded, had to sit down and my wife took me back to the hospital. I never actually pass out but I feel like I get close. Once again, ECG and chest X-ray are normal and they send me home with Ativan. The nxt day I was lucky enough to see a cardiologist and his first reaction was that he thinks my body “hit a wall” and couldn’t take my lifestyle anymore. Too much caffeine, nicotine, not enough sleep. I wore a 3 day heart monitor which showed a really high burden, something around 25%. He told me I was having a lot of PVCs but they weren’t in a concerning rhythm. I swear I was feeling ALL of them. I’ve had PVCS before but never anything to this amount. This was totally out of the ordinary. I had an echocardiogram, and he said the results were normal. He scheduled me for a cardiac MRI which I have coming up in a few weeks. He also prescribed 25mg of metoprolol once daily. 

So here I am about 5 weeks after the first incident. Im still anxious as hell and have no idea what happened to me. I still don’t feel well. My heart rate is resting around 54, I think it was around 60 before the medicine, and I have no energy. I wonder if this is from the metoprolol or if it’s something else with my heart. The good news is that I don’t have many PVCs right now, the medicine has seemed to get rid of 80% of them. But I just don’t feel good, I still get lightheaded easily and don’t feel like myself. Im sure anxiety is playing a role but I’m anxious bc of what has happened. Any advice or input would be appreciated as I just need some support right now.

* San Diego obviously has great weather and seems to tick most of my other boxes (correct me here if I’m wrong)
* Cost of living seems pretty comparable between the two (correct me here if I’m wrong)
* I would like to buy a home eventually but not in a rush at all

The main kicker:
* WA has no state income tax, which comes out to a fairly considerable amount for me (I know I’m lucky to have this “problem”)
* The money I save on this could easily pay for a couple months living in a warmer place each year working remotely",1,1735385459.0,SameGrassButGreener,2,1.0,False

People I've learnt life lessons from;
my Ex-friend and his Mother. (Nails in the coffin, topic)

People who turned into test from a previous lesson; ""ghost of you"" - Slim Bean with very visible Adam's apple. (On-going).

My Own Mother, with her early signs of Dementia increasing, as months carries over into the next and new year.

Treasured memories for this year alone;
Awesome Family holiday abroad, Florida itself. My first time to the States and the same with our daughter to Disney World, Kenny Space Centre & Universal Studios. We also took my partner's parents with us, as they wanted to see the joy and amazement in their granddaughter's eyes. To relive partly their old family holidays and maje news ones; Animal Kingdom park.

Obligations and duty of care;
My continuous support for my-in-laws on my partners side of family, too.

Most thankful and stability;
Is my own little family and my circle of my closest school Mum's and coffee meet up friends that I've gained this year. Mustn't forget my current work placement, a longest job that I've been in since left higher education.

But I still get rattled; when I meet other family members, who aren't the best for my own mental health but I have to be there in the background, to give them support too. When times needed. Untimely, they too are another branch of family ties that will become more prominent as they too progressing in their lives by making newer connections inwhich to bind us all closer together as a family safty network.

Post footnote;
As I continue to get older living my own life through middle ages. When times are tough again in the new year.
I must remind myself look where you'e gotten in your life so far past 10yrs. Compared that to previous 10yrs poor before that. Or to compare when I was 25yrs old - I had wanted to be released from thoes controlling invisible chains from my strict upbringing and over bearing Mother.

Hi everybody! This is my first post on this sub reddit, I started a summer job two weeks back so that I can make some money.
This is just me ranting about some of my coworkers. 

My coworkers are so infuriating to be around sometimes. I am new to this job so I obviously don’t know how to make certain coffee’s/smoothies or frappés. Which is fine in itself I’m still learning but for example someone shows me how to make a type of frappé and I will do it. The next day someone orders that frappé, I do it and another coworker sees me do it the way I was showed and tells me I am wrong. This time they make the frappé more liquidy, the same thing the next day and another coworker says I need to put more ice.

They also make me do everything sometimes, even when they themselves are not doing nothing, I think what makes me annoyed though is that sometimes I can hear them talking about me but I don’t know what they are saying because they speak a different language to me. 

Some of my coworkers have also treated me as if I was dumb, I don’t know if they do that because I am new or because I am still in highschool.

1ho3t4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ho3t4j/abusive_freeholder_who_lives_in_the_building_wwyd/,Abusive freeholder who lives in the building. WWYD?,"I own a leasehold flat in a victorian conversion in England. There is a flat above me, also leaseholders and a flat on the top floor, who is the freeholder. He was a leaseholder and decided to purchase the freehold from the management company when it was offered and previous leaseholders didn't buy it (apparently). I have my own front door (thank fuck).

The problem is he has severe issues. When I bought the house, he withheld the management pack and delayed the sale by months (I didn't realise he was the one responsible for this until I met him). When I moved in, he asked me repeatedly what I paid and chuckled at the thought of the previous owners losing money. He has tried to hit on me repeatedly - sending me messages saying I'm hot, that he's naked in bed and then constantly asking me for coffee when his wife and kid aren't around. He also tried to get me out on the scaffolding a few times, like literally 'Hey wanna climb out my window and onto the scaffolding with me?' I declined.

I had to tell him to stop taking my parcels if they were they left outside my front door when I wasn't in or just in the garden. He would take them to 'keep them safe' and put them in his car or the hallway of his house. He has fitted a camera in the porch of the building that he said is just recording the front door to the rest of the building but I believe it also captures the whole patio (which I own) and he seems to be aware of things like what time I go the gym in the morning and informing me my builder just stepped in fox poo.

I've observed that whenever the other leaseholder (not in the property, she rents it out) or her tenants challenge him on anything, he has a complete melt down and gets very vindictive. He's pretty much inflicted financial abuse on the other leaseholder by causing a lot of damage to her property when having his flat renovated and if she confronts him on anything, he ends up doing a 'property inspection' and finding something she needs to replace instead, and then uses legal pressure to force her to comply (last time it was replacing her windows). When the tenants asked to have access to the porch camera footage, he became incredibly angry over text and told them they will have to sign an NDA (?) and then threatened them with eviction (which he can't do).

Over Christmas, I noticed one of his workmen had caused some damage to my property when putting up a scaffold (the second time in a year we've had scaffolding for his flat) so I flagged this with him.

I was treated to an entire melt down over text that got incredibly personal and called me a snide bitch and said he wasn't my friend anymore, and ended with a threat of 'Am I going to have to come round and do a property inspection?' which is his code for 'I will come and find an issue that you will end up paying for.'

Basically, he's abusing his power as a freeholder and in my opinion, is guilty of harassment.

My friends have told me to screenshot all old messages and instances where he has made me feel uncomfortable and go to the police. Which I am going to do... Obviously, this is likely to make him worse if they end up speaking to him.

My other thought is to also band together with the other leaseholder and buy him out of our shares of the freehold. I know there are some changes to the leasehold bill coming in 2026, but I'm unclear about what they are and whether i'd just be wasting my money if freeholds & leaseholds get phased out. Buying my share would mean shelving some much needed renovation work tbh. But it's would also reduce him to being an annoying neighbour and co-building owner than someone who could financially cripple me.

TLDR: The freeholder to my building lives in the property and abuses his powers. He also has tried to hit on me repeatedly behind his wife's back. He gets verbally abusive and vindictive when confronted. He's inflicted financial abuse (IMO) on the other leaseholder when they've confronted him. I'm considering whether I and the other leaseholder buy out our share.",9,1735385085.0,HousingUK,7,1.0,False

A common pattern noted across all the Andaman & Nicobar tourist places is of the scam, by stopping you and asking you to scratch a card. If you don't win the first time, either you get another one or your partner or your kid get one, but you'll surely get a gift from the scratch card, probably one of - a tablet, cash, 3N/4D holiday or an expensive phone.

Next step is to convince you that what they need is just 1 hour of your time, where they 'll invite you to a well known hotel/resort and you'll get welcome drinks, tea/coffee, cookies etc., everything for free and you're only expected to listen to their presentation.

Once you go, they'll confuse you with things like, we'll ask for some details, you'll have to fill some forms, do you use credit/debit cards? which credit/debit cards do you use etc.

And then you're taken inside a conference room where you'll see the resort/brand names like Le Meridian, Radisson, W, Best Western and what not, none of which has anything to do with this organizations (Loyal Tree or Go Life Vacations) but just to impress you and play with your psychology. And then the game begins.

In short, they'll either make you feel guilty or greedy to go for their fraud membership which they call ""ownership"". You'll be asked to sign a legal contract with them and that's it.

You've been scammed!!!

They don't have any 3/4/5 star properties, even the google reviews of those properties are below 4-stars.

There is an annual fees on top of the membership fees and the exchange fees if you want to stay in any other good properties. Not to mention, there is no guarantee that you'll get a booking in the property you want.

You'd have been shown stars and moon during the presentation, but if you really read the contract or properly go through their documents which they show during the presentation to prove that they're an old company and registered with tourism department etc., you'll come to know most of what they're saying in presentation isn't correct.

And now starts the nightmares!!!

P.S. The lucky scratch card will ALWAYS have 3N/4D holidays with terms & conditions with which you'd probably never be able to utilize it.

I'll give a brief description of how we met, how things progressed, and where we're at now. Please let me know what the hell is going on because I've been out of the relationship game for a few years since breaking up with my boyfriend of almost a decade.

I'm a 30/F and he is 26/M

I was working as a government attorney and he was a police officer on one of my cases. I don't remember meeting him because I work in a big city and met with dozens of officers a day, but I guess we met sometime in April 2024. 4 months later, I quit the office and was applying for another state position. I was feeling lonely so I joined a (Christian) dating app, and he ended up being one of my matches. He sent me a message in July 2024 and let me know that he was an officer on one of my cases. He said ""I'm obviously attracted to you but not sure how you feel about the work related interactions."" I told him I quit the office and would be working in a different area of law soon, gave him my number, and told him to text me.

I think he texted me a week later. Our conversation was pretty innocent at first, but then within a week we were texting about furniture and out of the blue at 10PM he asked if he could come sleepover at my place. I'm celibate and waiting until marriage and he said he was too, so it threw me for a loop. We hadn't even gone on a date yet. I reacted pretty harshly, told him I think we want different things, and cut things off.

He texted me a month and a half later in September asking, ""Are you ready to go out now?"" I'll admit I was still upset about the attempted sleepover, so I responded, ""Do you even know how to plan a date?"" I also said he could have asked me to get coffee or ice cream but I'm not even worth the effort right? He responded saying ""I did over the phone and you said no it has to be dinner"", which never happened and makes me think he was confusing me with another woman he was talking to, because I would never say something like that. He also said, ""I think you overreacted to the sleepover."" I kept it short and cut it off again after that.

He texted me about a month later in November asking how I was doing. At this point his nonchalant determination was becoming attractive to me. We politely texted back and forth and within a week he was trying to come over again after I mentioned my oven wasn't working and he offered to come and fix it (not a sexual innuendo, apparently my pilot flame was out). I said no because I had to wake up early the next morning for work. I should mention that we have opposite schedules, he works nights and sleeps during the day, and I work during the day and sleep at night. He gets 2-3 days off a week and has pretty persistently tried to see me on his days off, but always very last minute and at night after 10PM. After that point, in the month of December alone he has texted me 5 different times on his days off trying to see me and every time I have found different excuses to turn him down. One reason why I've been avoiding him is because I find it very strange that he doesn't text me consistently, and goes ghost for 7-10 days at a time. He also only asks to see me very last minute, after 10PM, and at my place or his place (he lives with two roommates). He has never really tried to plan a date or outing and has tried to ""cuddle"" multiple times.

Finally, he asked to see me and kiss me on his birthday which was very recently this December. I agreed and told him I would give him a kiss and that he could drive over to my place, but that he couldn't come inside and I would come out to him a give him a quick birthday kiss. Keep in mind I'd been blowing this man off for 5 months at this point and have still never met him, but he remembers meeting me in April 2024. He did send me a bunch of selfies but I had no memory of ever meeting him in court. I will say he looked attractive in his photos though and is very much my type.

So when he came over that night, I came out and met him at his car. He looked handsome and I started to vaguely remember meeting him in April. I said happy birthday and he grabbed me by the waist and pulled me in for a kiss. It was a very sweet kiss, and I definitely felt sparks. We then went for a short walk around my block and talked mainly about work, then said our goodbyes. He gave me a goodbye hug (no kiss), and asked if we would see each other again, and I said yes and that maybe I would invite him inside next time.

He texted me the next day asking how my day was, and we had a short conversation before I went to bed. I didn't hear from him for about 10 days after that. Granted it was Christmas and I know he was busy working overtime, but it seems really weird. Finally, he texted me the day after Christmas saying he has the day off and asking to see me. I told him I wasn't feeling well and asked if we could try for another day, which wasn't a lie, I was actually on my period and felt like crap. We haven't talked since then and I anticipate another week or two long ghosting period before he resurfaces and tries to see me again with some low effort attempt that occurs last minute and after 10PM. However, next time I hear from him I will hopefully have your wisdom and input on the situation.

note from editing me - this ended up reading more like a poorly done Tumblr post but I can't figure out how Tumblr works so it's going here instead (btw includes lil bit of Narumitsu and Lanamia and lots of Miego)

this is kind of loose and I'm not an expert on Godot's characterisation, (or if he was executed or imprisoned?) so feel free to nitpick!

Here goes:

(Song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh79619xxk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh79619xxk8) )

Verse 1\]

*Hello Dan, it's Joe here*

\- Ok bad start, because I cannot for the LIFE of me, figure out who he could be writing to, I'm sure someone will point out a glaringly obvious character, but all the ones I think of work better in different parts. In the end, I think he is just addressing different parts of the letter to different people, but just sending it to Mia's old office (now wrights office) hoping it reaches them all

*I hope you're keeping well*

*It's the 21st of December*

*And now they're ringing the last bells*

\- Referencing the execution of criminals far worse than him, who he has to spend time around with until the last bell. It's the 21st of December It's almost Christmas, if this was an animatic MVK would be shown on that line.

*If I get good behaviour*

*I'll be out of here by July*

\- writing the letter with hope

*Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day?*

*Please don't let 'em cry for me*

\- I feel his connection with Mia left him feeling responsible for Maya and Pearl, this continues for the rest of the song

\[*Verse 2\]*

*I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland*

*And Stella's flying in from the coast*

\-various characters, gumshoe, Franziska maybe

*They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees, even more maybe*

*But that won't stop the roast*

*Who's gonna make the gravy now?*

\- Swap gravy for coffee lmao, you know what, just picture that for the rest of the song

*I bet it won't taste the same*

*Just add flour, salt, a little red wine*

*And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce*

*For sweetness and that extra tang*

\- replaced with coffee-related metaphors, his intricate recipe showing something he misses but remembers so fondly, for the original song and this interpretation



*\[Chorus 1\]*

*And give my love to Angus, and to Frank and Dolly*

\- Give my love to Maya, and her cousin Pearlie,

*Tell 'em all I'm sorry, I screwed up this time*

*And look after Rita, I'll be thinking of her*

\- Replace Rita with Mia, asking them to channel her regularly, to not forget her legacy

E*arly Christmas morning when I'm standing in line*



*\[Verse 3\]*

*I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend*

*- I hear Trite's got a new boyfriend*

*I hope he can hold his own*

*Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?*

\- what was her name again? (Iris and Dahlia, refuses to say their name or acknowledge them out of spite, it's funny to imagine he thinks the spirits are watching him angrily, so he just throws shade whenever he gets the chance)

*Ahh, just a little too much cologne*

\- looooads of spite, just a good old fashioned shortened version of how much he hated her, her facade and everything she did

*And Roger, you know I'm even gonna miss Roger*

*'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight*

\- Larry is just a perfect fit for this line. I didn't want to think too hard about it, but I realised this line is about him noticing how much he just misses life, all the people he loved, but even missing the annoying ones because they at least bring a sense of normality. Also, Godot would want to take Larry in a fistfight. fight me



*\[Chorus 2\]*

*Oh, praise the Baby Jesus, have a Merry Christmas*

*I'm really gonna miss it, all the treasure and the trash*

\- good times and bad

*And later in the evening, I can just imagine*

*Just don't hold her too close*

*Oh, brother, please don't stab me in the back*

Even after her death, he knows He will still hold onto her memory, (I know the debate over Godots sexism is ongoing, it does feel a little weird but the truth is Godot was fairly possessive over Mia, seems to emerge in these lines a lot.)

*I didn't mean to say that, it's just my mind it plays up*

\- Fear of losing Mia (maybe she and Lana can dance and forget about him when Mia's channelled, -Godot writing letters mentality)

*Multiplies each matter, turns imagination into fact*

\-this man is not ok fr, poisoned and in a coma one too many times

*\[Chorus 4\]*

*You know I love her badly, she's the one to save me*

*I'm gonna make some gravy, I'm gonna taste the fat*

*Ahh, tell her that I'm sorry, yeah, I love her badly*

*Tell 'em all I'm sorry, and kiss the sleepy children for me*

In his AND Mia's absence and the rest of the tomfuckery going on in Khurain someone gotta take care of them

*You know one of these days, I'll be making gravy*

*I'll be making plenty, I'm gonna pay 'em all back*

The ending you can piece together, begging with everything he wants, coffee and Mia that he can forgive himself.

This happened yesterday morning, a coworker of mine walked into the office all mad because she forgot her wireless headphones at home. 
Then I said to her, that’s OK. The office is going to be empty. Feel free to play your
music or podcast on your phone. I don’t mind. 
Five minutes later she said OK I just ordered another new pair on Amazon. I have decided to have another set in the office so I don’t need to worry about forgetting them.

Five minutes, just like that! She spent $25 online before her morning coffee at the office. 

This is not the first time she went on Amazon buying something without thinking. It’s like drinking water. 

Two months ago, the team was trying to decorate one of our coworkers’ office for her birthday. Someone decided having an office full of balloons was a great idea. So in no time sheagain she went on Amazon and ordered a big bag of balloons and also a balloon pumper. 
I said wait! Please no balloons. They are not sustainable and why a pumper!?
Everyone looked at me like i was a party pooper 

Do you find the whole online shopping culture is getting out of control ? It’s so easy to buy stuff now. Most people just don’t think twice before placing another order only for another box of useless stuff. It’s unbelievable.

1ho3iu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1ho3iu2/how_people_have_time_to_do_it_all_long_post/,How people have time to do it all (Long post),"Time is tricky. It’s both valuable and slippery, and many people struggle with carving out time for what they care about.

You’re also not going to feel good about yourself If you know or see someone who seems to do it all.

I want to show you how those people do it, and how the answers are much more underwhelming and accessible than you might think.

(The person you know/admire may do some or all of these things, but these are the patterns I have noticed)

**They spend less time on more things:**

It doesn’t take much to cross the beginner stage and impress people. If you spend 20 to 30 minutes on something three times a week and keep at it for a couple of years, people will think you’re decent at it.

This means you can spend one hour on three things, three times a week, and be seen as decent in all of them by most people.

Meanwhile, someone else spends one hour on one thing and only earns one trophy. The diminishing returns of expertise don’t help much either.

The illusion comes from this: because you’re not an expert in the hobbies of the person you admire, you assume they are more competent than they are and therefore you make the conclusion that they must have had more time.

In reality, they spend less time on more things.

(In some cases, they are competent as you deem them to be, but they also spent 5 years' worth of effort on it spread out over 10.)

**They had years of practice:**

This is really important to understand. Being able to maintain a habit, hobby, or side project that takes 10 to 30 minutes a day in its maintenance phase probably took years of messy, unproductive trial and error.

Any project demands an order of magnitude more time and resources at the start than in its maintenance phase.

Sure, it only takes them a short amount of time now, but it didn’t before, now they have efficient systems in place.

If you have 5 to 10 years and you want to be good at 3 to 5 things, you can start with one thing and reach its maintenance stage in a year or two. Then you add the second thing, and so on.

Before you know it, you’ll be a “master of time management.” where you can do all these things without breaking a sweat, and someone looking from the outside won’t understand how you perform that way.

**They delegate/automate:**

If you can spend one to two hours automating something you’ll never have to think about again, like bill payments or subscriptions, why not set it up?

You can get groceries delivered and drastically reduce your trips to the store. Keep a list of the items you care about and get those yourself, but let someone else handle the rest.

Also, get a roomba!

If you think this is too much, you’re right, it is. But people have sacrificed even more. They hire nannies, virtual assistants, and services of all kinds. What I suggested is just the tip of the iceberg.

If someone seems to be “doing it all,” maybe they’re doing one or two things they care about and is visible to the masses while delegating or automating the invisible, less impactful tasks. It’s more common than you think.

**They had minimal starting conditions**

Let’s say you want to write, draw, learn a language, or lose weight. Chances are you’ve set conditions that you think are “reasonable” for starting.

For many productive people, the starting conditions are much simpler (and sometimes dirtier). Most of our conditions are luxuries in disguise.

You may want a quiet place to write; they started writing on their phone while on the subway. You may need decent materials to draw; they used a regular notebook during lunch breaks.

At first, these setups are sneaky, messy, and barely functional. You’ll question if they’re even worth it.

But that’s only the case in the beginning. Over time, the process becomes more convenient, but that convenience only comes after starting under unfavorable conditions.

**They cared more than the pain**

This isn’t a motivational post. It’s about the basics of how the human mind makes a decision. Caring isn’t enough, you need to care more than the cost of the action.

Are you okay with spending money you don’t have to automate something you think is a luxury, just to carve out enough time to do something small and “pathetic”?

For some, the answer is yes. You need to care enough to tolerate the cost. Not everyone has that clarity or drive, but it’s important to view the person you admire within the context of their life, not yours.

This is not to paint their motivation in a good light, sometimes it’s healthy, other times it’s not, because they may dread or deeply dislike the situation so much that the pain of change pales in comparison.

If you were running for your life because a bear was chasing you, you wouldn’t care much about how tiresome running is, right?

**They follow a structure, sometimes blindly:**

I don’t want to talk too much about this but the general idea is this: the person knows exactly what to do and when to do it. For example, piano practice for 30 minutes at 8 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That’s it.

The focus isn’t necessarily on how well they perform during the practice, it’s about going through the motions. Simply having a clearly defined routine cuts out so much of the guesswork and friction that can derail action. The simpler the structure, the better.

Motivation and discipline will always fluctuate, but the brain thrives on routines and cues. A solid routine provides stability and consistency, even when your willpower is low.

Think about how much of a hassle walking would be if you had to consciously plan every movement. Sometimes, blindly following a set routine works in your favor.

**They're not that good at managing their time:**

This might seem weird, but many people who seem to do it all, don’t really do it all, sometimes they’re procrastinating in a different way than you do.

A common example that you may relate to is procrastinating on the work you need to do by doing work that is more appealing.

The same principle applies here, Maybe they’re neglecting crucial areas for others, maybe that's their way of coping with their emotions.

Everyone procrastinates, maybe not in the same way and to the same extent that you do it, but everyone does it in some way.

**Energy matters more than you think**

You can cut down a lot of effort just by eating right, sleeping right, and exercising right. Ask the person you admire what their energy levels are like.

Low energy is insidious. You might take twice the time to finish a task, only to realize it didn’t need to be done at all. Your priorities can become a mess, your patience gets halved, and your ability to learn, think, or articulate becomes impaired, you also need twice the amount of time to rest and catch up. A cup of coffee won’t fix all that.

Time management is rarely just about time. Energy always plays a role. You don’t have to take my word for it, just think about how much you got done on a day you felt rested. How pleasant was the experience? How “locked in” were you?

Your best day is some people’s default state.

That's it, that’s the underwhelming trick.

A good day where you sleep well, eat well, delegate the things you hate, and focus on the things you enjoy suddenly feels incredibly productive and you end the day motivated for the next.

I don’t even know where to start. I just got fired from my  *塾* teaching job today, and I can’t shake the feeling that the whole situation was blown way out of proportion. I wanted to share what happened and get your thoughts.



So, yeah, I’ll admit, I overslept a few times and was late to class. Teaching morning classes can be brutal, especially when you're up late prepping lessons or grading papers. It’s not like I make a habit of it, thoughI missed the start of my class maybe three times in the past couple of months. I always made sure to apologize and make it up to the students, but apparently, that wasn’t good enough for management. I should mention that this hasn't happened recently.

Then there’s this other issue. There’s a coworker I’ve been friendly with and she works at the front counter, and last week, I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. I thought we had good rapport, and I wasn’t pushy about it or anything. But apparently, she told our manager that it made her uncomfortable? Like, seriously? It wasn’t even a big deal, just a casual invitation.



Anyway, they called me into the office today and said I’m being let go for “unprofessional behavior” and “repeated tardiness.” They made it sound like I’m some kind of irresponsible creep, which is just ridiculous. I’ve worked hard for this job, and I care about my students.



Now I’m left wondering if I deserved this or if I just got a raw deal. Am I overthinking it, or is this kind of thing common in Japan? How do I bounce back from this?

Appearance- It's a  humanoid torso attached to a large door frame. The combined height is 9ft. The torso is a dark grey and a bit muscular. It's head has round yellow eyes with lines segmenting it, it has a fairly square head with spikes on top. It has no mouth, nose or ears. The door frame is a lighter shade of grey and the inside emanitates a blue light 

Ability - doorway dash-  The user can generate 5  door frames ( 1 including the stand itself) these can be placed as far as the user can visibly see. These doorframes are connected by a blue light, any object or organism caught in the door frame is propelled at 60 mph to the next door frame and can either stop there or move to the next one. If an object passes every door frame in a circuit it speeds increases by 10 mph until it's speed reaches a maximum of 120 mph. If the circuit isn't fully created the propelled items will be launched out the door frame atbtheir current speed. Objects within the circuit can collide causing great amounts of damage. If the user enters the circuit.  if the user enters the circuit they can't be damaged by objects in the door frame but can be from objects outside the door frame 

Ability -expansion pass- the stand can increase itself/ the doorframes by double is height or width. It can also decrease both values by half

User-  Michael (maniac) Jones - Used to be a F1 racer but someone found out he was using his stand to cheat so he got banned. So he decided to open a coffee shop and got decent success from that. He became good friends with Hadrian Zeppelli who tries to persuade him to learn the revolution but Michael doesn't care about dance dance revolution ( he has no clue Hadrian is referring to his stand) so charges him more every time he mentions it. However he does help Hadrian fight enemy stand users as he doesn't want people to harm his customers 

Michael originally named his stand highway star until he met a guy who already named that his stand so he changed it to owner of a lonely heart as he quite likes YES 

His nickname ""Maniac"" came from how he used to drive too safely so people as a joke called him maniac but he quite likes the nickname so continues to respond to it

Weaknesses- if the user can't see they can't place doorframes, the doorframes aren't durable so can be easily destroyed and then objects can be launched in inconvenient places

Stand combat- the stand can't really do much so it tries to grab opponents and throw them in the door frame

I don’t know why but ever since i saw him watching me in shock a few months ago since the 8 years we last talked, it just set something off in me. 


I didn’t think he’d recognize me but he did and i couldn’t read his face. His eyes were wide and he just stood there from a distance in that coffee shop. He couldn’t manage to at least turn his head away as he walked near me and im sure i was still within his vision as he stared at the walls. 

He looked at me again with this weird expression as he left. I felt disturbed by it. I can’t say why. I remember being mean and generally weird around him since I liked him a lot when we were small. It just didn’t translate well being a kid with little to no social skills. He followed me around regardless here and there as we grew.  But it’s worthless to think about him as it’s a waste of time. 

I don’t know I why can’t I stop thinking about him? It’s getting unhealthy since I have shit to do everyday and can’t afford wasting time thinking about him. But I always find myself looking him up on social media and it’s driving me nuts. 

I don’t want to run into him again now that we’re both on break from uni. It was disturbing to see him once and I don’t want it to happen again. ",2,1735382480.0,self,1,0.75,False

With my partner 29M we have been together for 10 years and have been through a lot together. Living together for 5 years. 

Last 12 months I have felt uncomfortable having sex between being tired muscle spasms and cramps sown there. I dont even feel comfortable being touched which is what my partner liked doing more than anything himself as he said to me he gets off from me getting off.

My partner has ASD and has other unresolved anger issues which he refuses to fully admit. His relationship with his parents was difficult and he was CSA by a family member with a brain injury when he was very young but continuously brushes it off only saying likes its a joke that he will just tap on the plate in their head when he feels like it and ""finish the job"" he thinks its funny but I think it is horrible and he brushes me off when I say thats not OK

He frequently tries to initiate sex but stops when I ask him. Hes never forced me to have sex and has always respected my wishes but I see the hurt. I wish he would understand that it's not him but me not feeling right. I've tried explaining to him and he spirals into angry looks or mumbling or saying ""right good to know this is the rest of our lives"" and ""yeah im sure it'll get better one day it's always maybe with you""

The way he looks at me sometimes is scary, its like he's hiding a cold rage. He says he's frustated and annoyed because I dont even hold or kiss him or do anything that I used to be he doesnt understand I am in pain or dealing with depression anxiety. He just doesn't get it.

He's never hurt me but he broke someone's nose last year when they grabbed him during an argument and sometimes when we argue or fall out he becomes impossible to talk to, he'll snap, look at me like an irritation when I ask him to do something like massage / rub my feet and when I tell him he barely tries he says ""so you say"" brushes it off acts like I'm an annoyance. I know sometimes when rubbing my feet if he is in a really bad mood he is less gentle with them and sometimes too rough but he doesnt seem to recognise this

I know he loves me but he is different to the person I met. When we first met he went out of his way to help even if he was clueless or a bit patronising it came from a place of love. Every tues after school he'd buy us a sandwich and we'd spend hours talking. Now he is difficult to order me a coffee saying ""where does the bloody money come from?"" 

Some days he will barely talk to me. He works a lot including out of hours IT support and dismisses any concerns of him working too much by saying ""I cant pull the money out of thin air can I?!"" 
Then he will start using examples of things he pays for or the monthly allowance he pays to me to have my own income as state benefits dont give me much and I cant work. 

Once when angry he told me ""at least he can be useful somewhere"" when I brought up he seemed to enjoy work more than me.

Once when I told him he made me feel small I overheard him muming maybe I should stop acting small.

I really don't know how to try and fix this. We both have said we want to make things better. I see him trying but at the same time he has bouts of doom and gloom.

Also, another thing. Maggie spent the night at his place. She wanted to see dad. He told me she can call and meet whenever she wants. I don't hide it anymore from her. I tell her the truth. So, I said she should call him.

OK. He agreed to pick her up but told me he will bring her back before lunch as he leaves the city. Good.

Honestly, I wanted her away for a while at least. I spent the night relaxing and watching thriller movies. In the morning, he brought her home (morning lol, not before lunch).

Maggie said she had a good time and watched Frozen with Ivan(yeah, i am sure he was very interested in her Frozen, but at least was with her in bed). And she said that Monica prepared her a nice breakfast. I was like what Monica? Monica, Lexie's mother.

Ah, ok. I know who she talks about. There a lot of young families in our neighbourhood. Lexie played with Maggie a couple of times, even though Lexie never came to our house. But it sounded like something Ivan would do. Bring another kid to play with Maggie so he can mind hid own business. He done it numerous of times. I never had anything against it because well, men... He was fine with kids, responsible, but didn't play with them. So ok, bringing little Lexie was like an escape plan for him. So, fine. Lexie probably spent the night at the house too, in the Morning her mother came to pick her up and prepared breakfast for them. Nothing weird.

Except, Maggie just told me that Lexie wasn't there at all. She didn't play with her since before the Christmas.

I asked: Lexie was not in the house with you?

No. Just me and dad. In the morning when I woke up, dad was with Monica having coffee together in the kitchen. Then Monica prepared me the breakfast.

We formed a deep romantic connection, but I'm scared of what is to come ","TL;DR - I'm (24m) asexual with a lot of live baggage, met a hypersexual girl (22f) with even more baggage. I want to spend my life with her, but don't know if I should because I think I won't meet her needs. 

Triggers - sex and mentions of trauma and self harm



I'm (24m) a fucked up by life asexual guy who is struggling with depression and being non-neurotypical (maybe BPD, ADHD, OCD, autism - I had to take a brake from diagnosing myself because of money and time restraints, but I'm getting there). English is my second language btw.

About half a year ago my fiancée and me broke up. We are together for almost 5 years, it was wonderful while it lasted but it had to end because of my asexuality. I could satisfy her, just not as often as she would hope so. We are still very good friends, but it surely hit me hard. I never shared that pain, I just accepted that it will be very hard for me to get another chance at a long relationship. 

I used dating apps but mostly just made friends. I made some good friends that always try to cheer me up. At the begining of December I was matched with a very interesting person (22f). She is also non-neurotypical, but I won't say more because of her privacy. I quickly found out that she has a high sex drive and is into some very kinky things - I'm too, because the excitement that comes with those things can keep me more interested in the act, but didn't try much mieth my ex. I was interested, but when I heard about her high libido I decided that she will be just a friend.

After a few days we went on a nice walk where I heard about her life story. For privacy reasons I will not share it but I was deeply sorry for her. I mat a lot of people who got hurt by life - it's one of my favourite topics when I meet new people, and I met s lot of them - and I have NEVER met someone as hurt and as strong as her. I even felt stupid for struggling with my depression and talking about my problems because they seemed so small compared to her story. After our walk we were chatting and I said something along the lines ""if you ever need a place to stay you can come to my place while you figure things out"". 



On the evening of 21th December I got a massage - her parent kicked her out. I picked her up the next day. We were going to spend a week together - at first we just continued to talk about our lives. I said more, she said more. She flirted, I jokingly flirted back, not thinking much of it and seeing it just as a way to make the atmosphere more casual. We half jokingly spoke about taking a shower together but decided not to. She was interested but had other relationships and we decided that it would make things too hard for her. 

Next day we talked some more. Christmas were coming and she had to meet up with her family and I just kept on comforting her. Christmas came and went, it made us get a little closer. When we came back I was prepping some food and we were just talking and joking about something... I don't remember why, but I half seriously half jokingly said something around the lines of ""Okay, I will stop talking about my problems because there is no need for it. I will shut them down"" and she hugged me from behind, told me that I'm not allowed to do that with her and she left to the bathroom. I froze in place. I dropped the knife I was holding and fell to the ground. I always had a problem with physical touch - I fear it and love it at the same time. It's my love language and I hate to hug strangers, but I love to have it with my close friends. She just did it and I fell apart. I didn't know what that ment. I felt violated, but also liked it that she felt comfortable around me. I also know that physical contact was a lot for her, but it was still a bigger step for me. I didn't know what to do and I couldn't get up.
I heard her leave and hastily collected myself, trying to hide everything that just happend to me. She seen right thru me, we talked, she was sorry for me and apologized... I don't think I was mad, just shocked.



Over next few days we got closer and closer. I don't want to bore anyone with details, but I did my usual stuff - I was supportive, always there when she needed me. She really appreciated that, she had some good and not so good partners before, so me being so nice all the time was a good thing for her. We went on a walk that ended in a Caffe. She got stressed out about ordering stuff but I calmed her down and ordered her a café latte and I got hot cocoa (don't judge me, I hate coffee). After she calmed down she looked me in the eyes with those beautiful blue spheres. They were shining at me with thankfulness. I thouth that she was just thankful for my support, now I know that there was more. She grabbed my arm hand and thanked me. At first I wanted to pull back but I was charmed... I just moved her hand into my palm and probably said something stupid and cute. 

We came back home and I asked her ""do you knows what I want to do with you on the couch?"". She asked me ""what?"" And smiled. I said ""I want to cuddle"". She agreed. That's when I felt that I liked her more than I intended to. She started to brush my forearm with her fingers, she touched me on my scars, a effect of even worse time in my life. I told her because she didn't notice, she pulled back, I said that I want her to touch me there. She brushed my arm more and kissed my forearm. I melted. I began to love her. 

We got closer... We tried to takie things to the bedroom but I couldn't have sex with her. I'm passionate, I wanted her to feel good and I know how to turn someone on, but that's where things end for me most of the time. She said that that's alright and that she had a good time. I tried to believe her. We spoke about being a full on couple one day and we both got excited, but tried to keep calm and really think about everything. She said that she would like to try, but she has some relationships that need closure first. I was alright with that. She went to her bed, but came to me in the morning. We tried again, same result, same reassurance, same doubt. The only thing that changed was more feelings. I went to work. 

When I came back we spend some time together, then she got a bit tired and took a nap while I went out for some groceries. I had a lot to hibk about...
She has high libido, I will not keep her satisfied all the time. She will be unhappy, and all I want for her to finally get everything from live she ever needed and wanted. I could give her all the closeness, empathy, help and love she needs, but I was sure that there will never be enough sex. And even if that will not be a problem I remembered one thing - I want to have kids one day, she had ""no kids"" on her profile. 

I came back very sad and laid next to her. I softly touched her face and we cuddled while she slept. When she woke up she immidletly noticed that something was wrong about me. She reads me like an open book... 
I told her about my thoughts around sex. She said that she doesn't care and that I bring her the satisfaction she needs. She feels wanted and accepts the way that our sex life may look like. Then I had to bring in the big guns - kids. 

That was a deal breaker for her. She doesn't like small children and is scared of pregnancy. I understood and was ready to pull my fellings back and lock them inside. Then she brought in the idea of adoption. That sweet, wonderful woman... She said that adopting a child will work for her, she can raise another human being with me but she doesn't want to go thru pregnancy and early years of the kid's development. I have seen a glimpse of hope, a possibility that we may be together one day... But I have to think about it. I have thought about adoption before, but as a last resort option if other ways won't work. 

We agreed on being in a situationship. We went on a nice evening walk. We danced at night in my apartment... She moves like a devil and I love how confident she is when she does that. We cuddled, talked and finally took that shower together, cuddled more, went to sleep in different beds (she feels more comfortable like that for now). 



Today I woke up a bit early and decided to lay with her in her bed. We cuddled, we kissed, we tried to have sex. Penetration did not happen but she was satisfied, I believed her this time. Later on I felt that I might be able to go a step further. I got a blowjob, it was amazing but I was unable to finish. We were both satisfied. I stayed in bed with her as long as possible because today she is leaving. When I will come back home from work she will not be there. She will be trying to close one of her relationships, unless she feels that she can get on with that guy. We both doupt it, looking at what happend, but I don't want her to block herself because of me. I left for work while she slept after our cuddle session. I cried the whole way here and listened to a song that makes me think of her a lot... 



Even after all this talk about acceptance and figuring workarounds with our future I'm still worried about her needs... I know I will treat her better than she was ever treated, I'm a deeply loving person and we have the same attachment style and love language, but I also heard about her sex life and I will never be able to satisfy her in that regard. My sexuality is not a matter of choice, it's just who I'm, and she deserves someone who will satisfy her.",1,1735382078.0,asexuality,0,1.0,False

Have been to Goa a few times and to North and South Goa both.

A common pattern noted across all the places irrespective of North or South (and got a first hand experience) is of the scam, by stopping you and asking you to scratch a card. If you don't win the first time, either you get another one or your partner or your kid get one, but you'll surely get a gift from the scratch card, probably one of - a tablet, cash, 3N/4D holiday or an expensive phone.

Next step is to convince you that what they need is just 1 hour of your time, where they 'll invite you to a well known hotel/resort like Sobit Sarovar Portico in Palolem or Grand Leoney resort in Vagator or something similar depending on where you are, and you'll get welcome drinks, tea/coffee, cookies etc., everything for free and you're only expected to listen to their presentation.

Once you go, they'll confuse you with things like, we'll ask for some details, you'll have to fill some forms, do you use credit/debit cards? which credit/debit cards do you use etc.

And then you're taken inside a conference room where you'll see the resort/brand names like Le Meridian, Radisson, W, Best Western and what not, none of which has anything to do with this organisations (Loyal Tree or Go Life Vacations) but just to impress you and play with your psychology. And then the game begins.

In short, they'll either make you feel guilty or greedy to go for their fraud membership which they call ""ownership"". You'll be asked to sign a legal contract with them and that's it.

You've been scammed!!!

They don't have any 3/4/5 star properties, even the google reviews of those properties are below 4-stars.

There is an annual fees on top of the membership fees and the exchange fees if you want to stay in any other good properties. Not to mention, there is no guarantee that you'll get a booking in the property you want.

You'd have been shown stars and moon during the presentation, but if you really read the contract or properly go through their documents which they show during the presentation to prove that they're an old company and registered with tourism department etc., you'll come to know most of what they're saying in presentation isn't correct.

And now starts the nightmares!!!

P.S. The lucky scratch card will ALWAYS have 3N/4D holidays with terms & conditions with which you'd probably never be able to utilize it.

PLEASE RUN AWAY IF YOU HEAR - LOYAL TREE, GO LIFE VACATIONS or something similar.

Which means I'll often have non-breakfast foods for my first meal, say pasties or leftovers from dinner. Overall, it's a pretty good system. But it does mean I can fall into bad habits when I'm tired or don't have time. Which is why I'm hoping having meal prep options will help me make better decisions. 

So, I tend to prefer a hearty savoury breakfast, especially if I can put it in the oven or on the stove while I prep lunch and make coffee. Prep/re-heat time is pretty generous since I try to give myself plenty of time to wake up before going to work- I'd say up to 40 minutes so long as I don't have to babysit it too much. 

A lot of recipes are very egg centric, which isn't the end of the world. I enjoy them but I don't think I can handle having an omelette or spinach and egg concoction every day (or even more than 3 times a week). I tend to gravitate towards things like bread, potatoes, and meat more than anything. I've tried breakfast muffins and they were quite good, it's got the meat and carbs, I can throw it in the oven and forget about it. Meat and eggs potato hash is on the meal prep list, I've made it plenty of times as a single serving but I worry about how it's going to reheat. Let me know your suggestions!

At the 9th month mark I realize I don't find her attractive at all, she's not the girl I was head over heels for. She barely takes care of her self now, she dresses like a bum everywhere she goes, she's nothing like how she was in her college years where she was fit, wore nice sexy clothes, and stuff like that. Then I start to think about all the guys she dated after rejecting me and how she'd look sexy for them, and workout, and do all sorts of stuff, but for me, nothing, barely any effort. Now I'm not here with a broken heart crying or anything, I'm fine with ending the relationship, it really doesn't bother me.

I had seen my PCP dozens of times, urgent care docs, 1 ER doc (per my PCP), an ENT, and 2 dentists on top of multiple students/attendings at a school of dentistry, and an infectious disease specialist and not ONE of them clocked my diagnosis right. I even had a incisional biopsy done on my cervical lymph nodes because they thought I had lymphoma from the symptoms.  I was tested for just about every infectious disease you can think of and about 10 others you never would. Everything was negative/non conclusive. 

Finally saw a rheumatologist early this week and she’s confident I have RAS.  She think I am extremely unlucky and have been having an undiagnosed and rare immune reaction to a medication I have been taking for years.  Very uncommon for people to have such severe and chronic outbreaks, and apparently even more uncommon for Caucasian people to develop RAS which made it harder to diagnose. 

Unfortunately, these ulcers have been running rampant in my mouth for almost 2 years. I had been on so many antibiotics (oral, IM injection, and IV), swished and swallowed nystatin and was just not being treated properly. I just started taking Colchicine twice a day, have cut out acidic drinks (because I have literally lived on coffee and soda for the last two years not knowing it wasn’t helping me heal), started swishing with a commercial oral ulcer rinse 4 times a day, and intermittent rinses with salt water if I eat or drink something.  I added a B12 supplement to my meds too. 

 Is there anything more I can be doing to help this cluster fuck of a mouth heal?  I’m so upset I have put up with this pain for so long and have done literally nothing to help treat it until now.  ",1,1735381123.0,CankerSores,0,1.0,False
