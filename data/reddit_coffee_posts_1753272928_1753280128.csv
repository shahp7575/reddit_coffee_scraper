Tried every model, but all of them start to explode pods or stop brewing altogether! So we just bought a new machine on FRIDAY from Best Buy. It was the only model we hadn't tried, the one that can also make iced coffee. TODAY- WEDNESDAY- it is no longer functioning! Not even one week!!! What is wrong with this company?!?!?!?!   
I want to try another brand but I use eco pods- sorry but I don't want my coffee brewed through plastic or aluminum... We'd switch to a regular coffee pot but spouse and I drink polar opposite coffee (decaf to strongest) Any insight helpful!!!",1,1753280041.0,keurig,0,1.0,False

You’d have a steady job, your own place, maybe a pet, probably a partner, and some kind of perfectly organized life.

Now here we are, just trying to stay hydrated, respond to emails on time, and not have a breakdown during yet another video call.

Some friends are married, some are on their third career change, some are living with roommates, and some are absolutely thriving on their own. The wild part is, it’s all completely valid.

So where did you think you’d be by now? And where are you actually?

1m7abo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m7abo0/we_had_a_deep_connection_then_she_vanished/,"We Had a Deep Connection, Then She Vanished Without a Word. I Don’t Understand What Happened.","I met a girl on May 8th — randomly, or maybe it was fate. It was my bro’s birthday party, and I’d recently reconnected with him after another girl ghosted me. That night he literally said, “Forget her. Just come tonight. Who knows, maybe you’ll meet your future wife.”

I shrugged it off. I wasn’t looking for anything serious. But then I met her at the afterparty. She was stunning — way out of my league, I thought. But we kept locking eyes. She started talking to me, and the connection was instant. Like we already knew each other somehow. She warned me not to fall for her because she was “anti-love” due to trauma. I respected that, but the way we clicked… I had to see where it went.

We ended up going to another club, where some blonde girl asked if we were together. We weren’t — yet — but this girl pulled me closer, held my hand, and later told the girl, “Yes, we are.” Then she dragged me out of the club, around the corner, held my hand tightly, and asked if I knew the blonde because she felt like that girl was trying to separate us. Possessive already… in a weird, sweet way.

We went home together. Spent the night. After sex, I told her I really liked her. She said she liked me too but warned that I might feel different in the morning. I didn’t. The next morning was warm and affectionate — cuddling, coffee, soft touches. Relationship energy.

Later I thanked her over text and told her I still didn’t feel different. She replied: “I really enjoyed everything, but I’m not looking for anything right now. I don’t want to give false hope.” I said that’s fine, we can be casual, no pressure. She didn’t say yes or no, but things continued.

Two days later, she invited me to visit her at her mom’s place — 1.5 hours away — and called to make sure I was coming. Her exact words: “Come quick before it’s too late,” “Promise?” and “Send me your live location.” Her mom even wanted to meet me.

When I arrived, she ran to me, jumped into my arms, held my hand, introduced me to her mom, kissed me on the cheek and neck, acted clingy and proud to be seen with me. Her mom even said, “I don’t know what you did, but she’s never like this.”

She said not to kiss her on the lips in front of her mom, but she kept grabbing my hand, calling me “hers,” and holding me tight. We had secret hand squeezes to signal if she felt unsafe. She used it once when an old man approached her, and I pulled her close. She melted into me.

That weekend was filled with real moments:

She gave me her phone password.

Let me go through her phone while she did her makeup.

Asked me to sit with her while she got ready (twice).

Surprised me by jumping out from behind a wall just to make me laugh.

Fed me her food. Let me rest my head on her chest.

Told me we needed nicknames for each other.

Said she wanted to buy a PC so she could play games while I play mine.

Even joked she’d “make me support her rugby team.”


We didn’t sleep in the same bed at first (her mom’s rule), but she checked if her mom was asleep, tackled me on the spare bed, kissed me, and told me to set an alarm so I could sleep in her bed for two hours.

We had sex again… but she suddenly stopped, turned cold, and when I asked what’s wrong she said:

> “Because I don’t love you. I only finish when I love someone.”
And then,
“NO — don’t get any ideas.”



Huh?

The next morning, she laid her head on my shoulder in front of her mom, asked me to stay longer, begged me to join her and her mom for the day. She looked so happy when I said yes. At one point, she charged me like she was going to jump on me and stopped short, just smiling.

But near the end of the day, her mom asked me what my 5-year plan was. I was exhausted and stumbled through my answer — not my best moment.

After I left, she texted me to say she was glad I got home safely. Sweet, right?

Then… the next day:

> “The weekend was really fun and I enjoyed it, but I think we’re too different. You didn’t do anything wrong, but I just want to be normal friends.”



I asked why. She said I don’t have a solid future plan and her personality is “a bit harder” than mine.

I told her I do have a plan — I was just caught off guard — but she doubled down. I didn’t push. I thanked her for the honesty, wished her the best.

Days passed. We texted on and off. She sent me an MGK song — “Iris,” a love song — and said it’s her favorite. We shared banter. But she started getting colder and more inconsistent.

Eventually, we saw each other again at the club. She hugged me for 6–7 seconds, looked so happy. She kept touching me while we talked. But then she started acting conflicted, like she was fighting herself. She said I made her uncomfortable for being “too touchy” (even though I was just leaning in to talk over music). She said we had an “understanding.” Then I left.

Three hours later, she called me. Asked where I was, if I was safe, if I ate. Said she was going to another club alone. I went to meet her. She was warm at first — held my hand, fed me again, asked me to sleep over. I couldn’t, and immediately she turned cold again and gave me a one-arm hug goodbye.

That weekend, I asked her to make plans for my birthday. She said she’s busy — moving. Okay. The same week, I saw her at the club again. She avoided me. Gave me a weak hug. Didn’t wish me happy birthday.

Eventually, I sent her a long, honest message — remembering all the small things about her. I said I don’t believe we were just “normal friends.” I said I wouldn’t chase her anymore, but I’d always be grateful. I said in a world full of beautiful girls, I’d still choose her every time.

She never responded. Two days later, she deleted my number and unfollowed me.

Then came the craziest moment — two weeks later, she came back to the club after a full month of disappearing.

And she literally tripped over me.
No exaggeration — I turned around, and she physically tripped over my foot. We locked eyes for 2–3 seconds. Her eyes widened. She walked away quickly and shouted “F***!” to her best friend.

A few days later, I saw her again. She was with her mom and bestie, up on the top floor. I caught her staring at me a few times. Then a guy showed up. I’m guessing that’s who she was smiling at on her phone earlier.

I don’t know what I was to her. A weekend high? A test? A placeholder? A trigger?

But I remember everything. Her scent. Her voice. Her touch. Her cat’s names. Her coffee order. The way she squeezed my hand 3 times. The way she smiled when she thought I wasn’t looking. I still don’t understand what happened. How do you go from that much connection — meeting her mom, holding hands in public, sharing vulnerable things — to being a complete stranger overnight?

Has anyone been through something like this? Is this fearful-avoidant behavior? Did she feel something real and get scared? Or did I imagine it all?

I just want to understand.
Because I’m still stuck wondering…

1m7abd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m7abd1/why_choose_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_deluxe/,Why Choose the Nespresso Vertuo Pop Deluxe Espresso Machine?,"Sleek, compact, and surprisingly efficient, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe ENV95S has become a significant addition to my coffee corner. As someone who refuses to start their day without a robust cup of coffee or a velvety shot of espresso, I knew I needed a machine that could handle both. I'd heard a lot about this model, and with its promise of versatility, modern features, and stylish design, I couldn't resist giving it a test drive. While it impressed in many areas, there were also a few quirks I noticed during daily use.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my attention is how polished and modern the coffee maker looks. This silver beauty is compact enough to fit snugly on my small kitchen countertop without cramping the limited space. Its brushed metallic finishing adds a premium touch, so it doesn’t just brew the coffee; it becomes part of the kitchen decor. Despite its sleek design, the machine is robust and weighs just over ten pounds, which makes it feel substantial but not cumbersome to move. One noteworthy detail is the removable water tank, strategically placed on the side. Refilling is a breeze, and with a 37.2 fl oz capacity, I don't feel like I’m constantly trekking back and forth to the sink. The adjustable drip tray was another thoughtful feature that allowed me to switch effortlessly between small espresso cups and larger travel mugs.

**Performance**  
This is where things got really interesting. The machine uses Nespresso’s patented Centrifusion technology to adapt brewing settings based on the capsule’s unique barcode. This means precision brewing every single time with zero guesswork. It delivered fragrant coffee that struck the perfect balance between flavor and intensity. Testing its ability across all five brewing sizes (single espresso to towering 12 oz coffees), I found consistency in every cup. The feature that brewed coffee over ice quickly became my best friend during sweltering summer afternoons.

[Discover if Nespresso ENV95S is on sale at Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0c3f2s53n/)  

**Ease of Use**  
I am all for kitchen gadgets that don’t require a Ph.D. to operate, and the Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe offers true simplicity. A single button takes care of everything—from starting the machine to ejecting used pods automatically. It heats up within 30 seconds, so even those mornings when “extra coffee time” isn’t an option, one can still manage to make a quick cup. While testing, I particularly appreciated how low-maintenance it seemed; the machine is even smart enough to update itself via Wi-Fi to ensure optimal functionality. It’s almost as if it’s doing the hard work for me. However, I will admit, getting it connected to my home network for the first time wasn’t the most intuitive process.

**Sustainability Efforts**  
One aspect of this product I respect greatly is its environmental approach. The machine is compact but made impressively from 35% recycled plastic, a refreshing adherence to sustainability. What also stood out is Nespresso’s initiative to make its aluminum capsules fully recyclable. As someone who is conscious about reducing waste, I found their free recycling program to be an encouraging bonus.

**Good Points**  
- Compact and modern design fits in smaller spaces without compromising style.  
- Versatile brew sizes ranging from espresso to 12 oz coffee.  
- Centrifusion technology ensures perfect brewing precision for every capsule.  
- Environmentally conscious construction and recyclable capsules.  
- Easy operation through a one-touch control panel and rapid heating.  

**Bad Points**  
- Exclusivity to Vertuo Capsules, limiting third-party compatibility.  
- Initial setup for Wi-Fi connectivity can be a little tricky.  
- Slightly cumbersome to clean the pod chamber if you’re particularly hands-on.  

**Competing Brands**  
In the world of single-serve espresso machines, competition is fierce. If you’re familiar with Keurig’s K-Cup systems, it might cross your mind as an alternative. Keurig boasts similar ease of use but lacks the premium, artisan touch that Nespresso capsules bring to the table. The Nespresso machine triumphs in brewing flavor-rich espressos compared to Keurig’s beverage lineup, which leans more on drip coffee. For those sensitive to waste, Vertuo stands out for its recycling programs, a feature that leaves competitors like Breville and Keurig lagging behind. However, Breville gives Nespresso a run for its money with slightly enhanced customization over water temperature and brewing strength in some of its machines.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
This coffee machine feels like a balanced mix of affordability and luxury. While it certainly isn’t the cheapest option out there, its versatile brewing system, sustainable build, and the convenience offered make it feel like a worthy investment. Other high-end espresso makers would easily cost more while delivering fewer features. If you’re brewing daily like I am and prefer coffee-shop quality from your kitchen, the machine justifies its price tag. For budget-conscious buyers, though, the cost of proprietary capsules adds up—this might be worth considering.

i don't expect everyone to be as crazy about being punctual as i am, but it seems that 9 times out of ten, a date will text me about 30 mins before the actual real go-time that they're going to be late, for such and such reason. it didn't bother me the first couple times, because hey, stuff gets in the way, but it's been so consistent that it's starting to feel like maybe i'm missing something, or doing something wrong.

to clarify, i'm not talking about being five minutes late, because traffic was bad-- that barely shows up on my radar. i've had multiple dates in a row say they're going to be late, and have me sitting looking dumb in a coffee shop for a full hour, sometimes even two (i know it probably sounds sad to wait around for two hours, but i didn't know what else to do in that situation). i’ve noticed that my dates, regardless of gender identity, does not seem especially apologetic about their tardiness— not that i demand apology, but they kind of just act like this is typical, expected behavior. 

i can’t help but feel like a low priority when this happens, and it sours the dates for me. is it me? or is this common in the dating scene? how do i stop this from happening to me in the future? how do i communicate that tardiness is a dealbreaker for me without sounding like a control freak?

Hoping to get some advice from folks who are more experienced.

**Current Setup (since March 2022):**

* Gaggia Classic Pro
* Breville Smart Grinder Pro

**Coffee Preferences (kinda?):**

* We haven’t experimented much because dialing in is such a pain with our current setup.
* Our go-to is Café Britt’s Montecielo. Haven’t really deviated.
* I *think* I like body but also appreciate clarity.
* My wife *thinks* she prefers clarity.
* Since we mostly drink milk drinks, we’re not even sure how much it matters.

**Daily Use:**

* 98% of the time we make iced lattes (me: unsweetened almond milk, her: unsweetened oat milk)
* 2% of the time: hot lattes or cappuccinos in colder weather

**The Problem:**

* Some days our drinks are great. Other days they’re awful. Same beans, same workflow- wild inconsistency. I’m over it.
* Time to upgrade the grinder (and storage system, but that's covered)

**What We Want:**

* Easy to dial in
* Consistent results
* Single-dose
* Would be *nice* to shift over to French press, AeroPress, Moka, pour-over, etc, but not a priority

**Budget:**

* \~$1,000 or less is ideal, but room to stretch if there's obvious value

**Grinders We’ve Considered:**

* **Niche Zero** – Feels a little dated and pricey now, but still probably my top choice
* **Philos** – I think my 2nd choice?
* **X64SD** – Intriguing, but not enough real-world info yet
* **DF64** **Gen 2**– For whatever reason, I just don’t love it
* Open to other suggestions

Would love thoughts from you all on considerations or recommendations.

Within a week of the separation, she was went on Tinder and and slept with someone else under the guise that “we weren’t together.” She lied about it at first, but even after admitting it she showed no remorse. Since then, I’ve emotionally started to detach, which has caused her to spiral with the classic tactics: gaslighting, deflection, guilt trips, followed by silence. 

Last week she tried to withhold our daughter’s tablet and her shoes for school unless I agreed to pack her remaining things. She essentially used our child’s needs to as leverage. This came after she didn’t know the start date of her custody and had no bedding or clothes ready for her first day of custody.

Yesterday, I met her for coffee and laid out three conditions for reconciliation- faithfulness, consistent counseling, and real accountability. She said yes to all three, but with no conviction or remorse. It’s like she did it out fear of losing me. That was the moment I realized she would say anything to stop the pain of losing control, not because she truly wanted to change. So I ended things realizing her chance of change was slim to none.

When did you realize your partner wouldn’t change, and how hard was it to fully detach from them, particularly when you still have to co-parent with them?",1,1753279572.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

What helped? Plotting breaks and filling them with genuinely restorative activities first. 

It makes a lot of sense too. I need both the time and the energy to get into gear, so you’ve got to address both parts of the equation. 


- Plot deliberate break slots across your schedule for a week.

- Trial a few different activities in these slots and make note of those that gave you more energy.

- Keep these in your back pocket for reuse alongside scheduling high-focus tasks in the future.


20 mins scrolling on my phone at lunch felt like a break, but does nothing for my energy. Neither does chatting to a colleague about work, or casually browsing my emails. 

It’s the short walks, sitting outside, checking in with a mate, calling the kids or reading a few paragraphs of a book that does it. Seems simple, but plotting these types of deliberate breaks recharges me and massively reduces how often I let myself get distracted when sitting down to do the thing I actually want to focus on. 

I guess it’s as much about managing the conditions for momentum as it is the time and what you want to get done.

I (24f) have been working at this marketing job for about 2 months after being laid off from my previous role of 2 years. One thing I’ve noticed is that there is a night and day difference between the way my current boss, John (~60m) and my previous boss, Cheryl (~40f) treat me and how I work. I’m going to start by comparing how different John is to Cheryl, and then I’ll explain why he makes me uncomfortable.

For one, Cheryl was almost fully remote, while I would go into the office with one day remote. She’d let me leave early if it was nice out of if it was slow, and she always encouraged me to take time off, especially for mental health days or family emergencies. When Cheryl would come into the building, we shared an office, and she never micromanaged or looked over my shoulder; she always waited for me to ask for feedback on what I was working on and trusted I’d get stuff done.

As for John, we’re in a cubicle environment 5 days a week, and he drives me INSANE. Nearly every time he walks behind my computer, he makes comments on what I’m doing. Not inherently bad, but it’s distracting when I’m focused and trying to get stuff done. He’s always grunting under his breath and talking to himself, like he can’t stand silence. Sometimes it feels like some of the stuff he says to himself, he says to get me to be like “what’s wrong, John?” He told me I can wear my headphones if I ever get distracted by the other people in the office, but honestly, I mainly wear them so I don’t have to listen to him make noise all the time. John has told me he’s been written up for snapping at coworkers to be quiet, and HR once told me he’s “kind of a grump, but good to work for.” (lol yeah ok)

As for why John makes me uncomfortable: 

1. We travel from one company location to the other together sometimes, just the two of us because we’re a 2-person team. One day, I commented on how the woman in the car next to us gave me a dirty look, and he said “it’s probably because you’re prettier than she is.”

2. The next day, I was standing while talking to him about a project, and he looked me up and down while I was talking, grinned at me, and said “you look very nice today.”

3. We had a press conference outside where I offered to help clean up, but it had started raining, and John told me he didn’t want me to have to deal with the rain and go back to the office to work on photos. In front of another female coworker, who’s also my age, he said “I’m sure glad I didn’t have to get you wet today.” 🤢 (we were almost out the door atp so I didn’t even get to see her reaction)

4. I caught him checking me out from behind while I was packing my things to go home, and he just grinned at me. It made my stomach turn.

5. He’s made a few misogynistic comments about women in general, even about our CEO. For example, John said the CEO said that she thought the press conference went “fine.” John told me “don’t ever be the kind of girlfriend or wife who says it’s fine when it’s not.” He also made a passive comment about one of our coworkers saying he loves his wife; coworker said “she makes me better,” and John said “are you sure about that?” (He’s divorced twice, has no kids, and drives a brand new sports car. When I told my mom this info, she said it’s a huge red flag. Take with that what you will.)

I’m honestly not super passionate about the work I’m doing at this role, so between that and dealing with John’s weird ass is making me want to leave this job and find a new one. It’s gotten to the point that I start getting the Sunday scaries as early as Saturday morning, that’s how much I hate this job, and it’s only been 2 months. But at the same time, as someone who was recently laid off, we all know it is SO HARD to get a job right now, especially in marketing. Part of me wants to take this as a sign to just work part-time at a coffee shop and start freelancing, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time now, but I don’t know if I’d want to take a pay cut right now, since I’m trying to save to move out. I should probably stick it out, since I think John has taken the hint, but I’m honestly so miserable here. I would go to HR, but since it hasn’t happened in a couple weeks, I’m hesitant. Plus, he’s friend with the one HR person we have and there is nobody else on the marketing team, and I don’t think I could continue to work with him after a confrontation like that.

If anyone has ever been in this position, please send help!!! Thanks in advance :)",1,1753279386.0,TwoHotTakes,3,1.0,False

For thirty years, I was the invisible wife. The forgotten mother.

On our 30th wedding anniversary, I saw a gift box on the kitchen table. For a moment, I thought they remembered me. But then David snapped, “That’s for Kate. Today is a big day for her career. Don’t you know how to ask before assuming?”

Kate—my best friend, now my husband’s mistress. They remembered her. Not me.

I whispered, “It’s our last wedding anniversary together. I have only six months left to live. Maybe you could finally fulfill your promise. From when we got married… the trip to Alps, to see the snowfall.”

He laughed in my face.

“Alps? And how would you even survive the cold if you are as sick as you claim? Stop using your disease as a weapon to seek attention. We are all sick of that.”

Then, just when I thought it couldn’t hurt more, five tickets to the Alps were booked. My whole family began packing for the trip, excluding me. My place had already been taken by Kate.

So that night, I packed my bags. Blocked their numbers. Filed for divorce. Joined a program inviting old superstars who had left their career for family.

Because now—for the first time in decades—I’m choosing me.

——

I woke up on our 30th wedding anniversary to find a beautifully wrapped gift box in the kitchen.

Alongside the gift box, there laid a letter, beautifully written by my husband which read \[To the woman I love the most\]

My heart swelled, a fragile, trembling hope blossoming in my chest. After three decades of pouring my life into this family, sacrificing my own dreams, had they finally truly seen me? Did they finally appreciate me?

With trembling fingers, I unwrapped the gift box. There laid two tickets for Alps and a beautiful diamond ring along with a pair of sturdy, stylish snow boots.

I reached my hands for the ring first. It was exquisite, a single, brilliant stone set in a delicate band.

I recalled the day of our wedding when David had proposed to me with a silver ring, promising to give me a diamond ring later. Though the day never came during the past thirty years.

“I’m struggling in business for now. But, I promise you babes, I’ll take you to the mountains of Alps and show you the first snow fall of the season.”

“I know you love cold places.” he had said the first time he went hiking with his friends after our wedding, without me.

Finally, he fulfilled his promise!

I slipped the ring onto my finger, and it fit perfectly, catching the light as if reflecting the sudden warmth flooding my entire being. A happy tear escaped my eye. This wasn't just a ring; it felt like a symbol, a promise that I was cherished, that I mattered.

Next, I unwrapped the packing of the boots' box, my hands still trembling from the emotion.

I put the shoes on to see if they fit. That's when I heard David barking at me from behind.

“Keep your dirty legs away from that!”

David charged at me. Before I could even react, he pulled the boots out of my hands, the one I hadn't put on yet.

“I-I thought that's for me.” I stuttered. “Isn't it our wedding anniversary gift?”

“At this age, you want me to celebrate our anniversary? Are you kidding?” His words cut deep through my heart.

“This gift… I had specially prepared for Kate. She has been announced as the richest business woman of the city. But, you have ruined everything.” He spat, his voice laced with fury.

He quickly came forward. Snatching the ring from my fingers, he added. “That's for Kate!”

“But, it's our last wedding anniversary together. The next year I might not…” Words were dead before I could complete the sentence, my lips shivered in remorse.

I had been diagnosed with cancer. Last night, Doctors told my family I had only six months left.

I thought maybe just maybe they would appreciate my presence now that I was dying. This was why I dared to think the gift actually meant for me. But, I was wrong.

I was still invisible in their eyes!

“What's all this fuss about?” Ethan, my son walked into the kitchen, throwing his dirty cup in the sink to have me wash them.

“Your Mom assumed these boots were for her. She unwrapped the gift box and dirtied it.” David barked, busy in checking if I had stained the boots he bought for his beloved, Kate.

“Are you serious, Mom?” Ethan laughed, “Do you really think Dad will take you to the Alps to see the snow fall?”

“Have you seen your body thoroughly? You are so weak and sick. You will only humiliate yourself and Dad.” Rosemary, my son's wife, joined him in mocking me.

“Aunt Kate is the same age as you. But, she looks so young and active unlike you, always sickly. It's obvious that Dad would prefer taking her out over you.” She had added.

“And why am I like this?” I rebelled. “Isn't it because I have been doing all the household chores for all of you?”

“Now, you are putting the blame on me?” David yelled, throwing the boots on my face. He didn't even flicker when the boots hit my head.

“Isn't it because you lacked education and were only good at doing household work? Unlike Kate, who is handling her husband’s whole business after his death and is still so beautiful and refreshing.”

David’s words had sent shivers down my spine. Out of all the people, he had the audacity to call me over my education when I had used my college fees to send him abroad to complete his studies.

“David… How can you-” Before I could confront David, he walked closer to me, showing the company name written on the other boot as he barked near my earlobes.

“It was a limited edition boots, the one Kate likes the most. But, you have stained them with your dirty feet.”

“Now go find similar boots for her, and if you can't find them, don't return home.”

After throwing out these words, David left the kitchen.

Rosemary scoffed, “You have brought this to yourself, Mom. How did you even think of comparing yourself to Aunt Kate?”

“Anyways, before leaving to find these boots, please clean Max’s room. He has spilled the soup all over. It smells so bad that I can't step in.” She commanded, before throwing herself on the couch.

I dragged myself towards her and said. “I’m not your maid, Rosemary. If Max has dirtied his room, then clean it yourself. He is your son. It's your responsibility to take care of him.”

Rosemary’s relaxed pupil fluttered and she got up from the couch. “If you aren't a maid, then hire one! Do you have money for that?”

“Everyone here does some job. It's you who doesn't earn a penny and is a free loader for the family.” She yelled.

Seeing the arguments heating up between us, Ethan chimed in. “Why are you taking your anger on Rose, Mom?”

“She has a meeting in the evening. You won't die by cleaning a room, will you? After all, you have been doing these things since decades.”

“Rosemary is different. She hasn't done this type of work before.”

This was my life. A domestic servant, a wife and mother who was nothing but a punchline.

Cooking, cleaning, mending—every single household chore—even balancing the family budget and paying the bills—fell to me.

My shoulders constantly ached from the burden of it all. But despite everything… I was still just a joke to them.

\*\*\*

After everyone went to their respective rooms, leaving their work for me to do, I was left alone.

I did not go to look for the boots. Neither did I go to clean Max's room. I walked straight to the store room where unwanted things were kept, just like me.

After a long search, I finally found the wooden box that I had kept for years. As soon as I opened them, my eyes were filled with the old pictures- All mine!

I looked happiest in them, singing on stage while people going crazy on me, a dream that I had left behind to look after this family.

Not anymore!

I dialed a number. As soon as the call was picked up, I said, my voice firm.

“I want divorce from my husband of thirty years.”



Chapter 2

The cold, stale air of the storeroom seemed to mirror the emptiness in my heart. The pictures in the wooden box were faded, the edges curled with age, but the memories they held were vivid, almost painfully so.

There I was, younger, vibrant, bathed in stage lights, a microphone clutched in my hand, a roar of applause echoing in my ears.

I remembered the thrill of performing, the raw joy of connecting with an audience through music. That Sabrina, the one who lived and breathed for the stage, felt like a ghost from another lifetime. A lifetime I’d willingly, foolishly, given up for David.

""I want a divorce from my husband of thirty years.""

The words, once a terrified whisper in my mind, now rang with a newfound clarity as I spoke them into the phone. On the other end, the familiar voice of my lawyer, Mrs. Greta, sounded surprised.

""Mrs. Cooper? Is everything alright? This is quite a shocker.""

“It's rare for people to get divorce after spending such a long time together.”

""No, Mrs. Greta, nothing is alright. And it's not sudden. It's thirty years overdue,"" I replied, my voice steady despite the tremor in my hand that clutched the phone. ""I want out.”

I heard her jotting down notes. ""Of course, Mrs. Greta. Can you come to my office tomorrow morning? We'll discuss the details.""

""Yes. Nine AM. I'll be there.""

I hung up, a strange mix of fear and exhilaration coursing through me. It was terrifying, this leap into the unknown, but also liberating. The thought of breaking free, of reclaiming myself, was a powerful current pulling me forward.

That night I quietly walked to my room. David, who was busy on his phone, smirked looking at me.

“You didn't find the boots, did you?” He barked, still the same intensity of anger in his eyes.

I clutched the phone in my hands before I turned to him and said lazily. “I’m tired, David.”

After throwing out these words, I simply laid beside him, my heart racing in my chest.

Just as I expected, David got up from the bed. He threw the pillow on my face and yelled. “From next time, don't ruin my moment with Kate if you can't fix it!”

Having said that, he walked out of our bedroom. He sat in the living room and turned on the TV. Kate's sweet voice in the interview pierced my ears as they echoed through the hall.

Two drops of tears rolled down my cheeks. Kate, my best friend, was the woman David originally wanted to marry.

If she wouldn't have been so ambitious to go after a man richer than David, he wouldn't have even thought about marrying me no matter how many sacrifices I had already made for him.

I still remember the day David asked me to marry him. It was a sunny afternoon, and we were sitting in the small café near my college.

David took my hand, his eyes filled with a sincerity I had grown to trust. ""Sabrina, from the moment I met you, I knew you were special,"" he said, his voice low and gentle.

""You're kind, caring, and you make me feel seen in a way no one else ever has. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.""

At that moment, I believed him. I believed that he loved me for who I was, that he valued my sacrifices and my love. I said yes without hesitation, thinking that I had found my partner, my best friend, my soulmate.

But now, as I looked back, I realized that it was all a facade. David had wanted Kate, with her ambition and her drive. I was just a consolation prize, a Plan B.

The thought stung so deep, I could not sleep the whole night. Kate’s voice continued echoing through my ears.

The next morning, I dressed meticulously, not in the drab clothes I usually wore for housework, but in a simple, elegant knee length dress I hadn't touched in years.

My reflection in the dusty storeroom mirror showed a woman with shadows under her eyes and a tired slump to her shoulders, but also a flicker of something new—resolve.

But, as I passed the living hall, Rosemary stood before me, her arms crossed. “Why haven't you washed Max’s room yet? And the kitchen, it's a whole mess!”

“Mom, where is the breakfast? You know I leave early for work.” Ethan yelled from behind, his voice laced with disappointment.

“Grandma Sabrina! You are such a fool and stupid. Why don't you go to school to learn something?” Max, my six years old grandson, barged in the living room, dressed in his school uniform.

His voice laced with childish cruelty as he complained.

“I asked you to put the Maths book in my bag pack, but you put the Science book instead. Now, I have to go back upstairs to put the correct book inside.”

“Why will you exhaust yourself, son? The one who made the mistake, will correct it.” Rosemary snapped back at me, her tone commanding as always.

“Why are you standing still? Go upstairs and change the books, Mom.” She had added turning to me.

“I’ll not!” I said, my voice stern. “If you have a problem with my work, then do it yourself.”

Chapter 3

My refusal hung in the air, a shocking silence falling over the living room. Rosemary's eyes widened, her jaw dropping slightly.

Ethan, halfway into the kitchen, spun around, his expression a mix of disbelief and annoyance.

Even Max, who usually held court with his childish pronouncements, looked momentarily stunned.

""You'll not?"" Rosemary repeated, her voice low and dangerous. ""What exactly did you just say, Mom?""

""I said, I'll not,"" I repeated, my voice gaining strength with each word. ""If you have a problem with my work, then do it yourself. Max is your son, Rosemary. His room, his books—they're your responsibility.""

Ethan finally chimed in, ""Mom, what's gotten into you? You know Rosemary has an important meeting. You've always handled these things.""

""And I've handled them for thirty years,"" I countered, my gaze sweeping from Ethan to Rosemary. ""I've cooked, cleaned, managed this house, and taken care of everyone's needs. And what have I received in return? Mockery, disrespect, and an utter lack of gratitude.""

Max, recovering from his surprise, piped up, ""Grandma Sabrina is being mean! She's supposed to help me!""

Rosemary stepped forward, her face hardening. ""Don't you dare speak to us like this, Mom. You're a freeloader. You don't contribute anything to this family financially. The least you can do is manage the house.""

""A freeloader?"" I scoffed, a bitter laugh escaping my lips. ""Is that what you call the woman who bought this very house we're standing in?”

“The woman who gave her college fund to your father so he could study abroad? The woman who poured her life savings into his 'struggling business' when he had nothing?""

Their faces, usually so confident in their disdain, finally showed a flicker of shock. They knew about some of it, of course, but I had never thrown it back in their faces like this.

I struggled to breathe with this argument and decided to end it. So, I added. “I have an appointment with my doctor. I’m getting late for it.”

With that I turned to leave but a low whisper escaping through Rosemary’s lips left me stunned.

“Appointment with the doctor, my foot! Does she still think we are believing her ‘diagnosed with cancer' nonsense?”

“I didn't expect Mom to go that far in seeking attention that she would fake her own disease. She is such a sham on our family.” Ethan added, his voice laced with ridicule.

I couldn't believe my ears. So, all this time they had been thinking I was lying about my sickness?

My own son accused me of being an attention seeker and causing unnecessary drama in the home. I clutched the medical reports in my hands, letting the tears soaked me completely, for one last time.

Because after today, nothing will matter to me anymore.

I went to see my doctor. After doing routine check-up, he let me go with strict instructions of taking rest and living stress free which I doubt I could do unless I get divorce from David.

Thus, I finally made my way to see advocate Greta.

At Mrs. Greta’s office, the atmosphere was quiet, professional. She listened patiently as I recounted years of emotional neglect, the financial exploitation, the constant humiliation.

I laid bare the story of my college fees, the house I’d bought, the life savings I’d given David for his business. It felt like shedding layers of old, painful skin.

""Do you have any documentation for these financial contributions, Mrs. Cooper?"" she asked, her pen poised.

I nodded. ""Yes. I kept everything. Bank statements, property deeds, old receipts. Even letters from David acknowledging the money.""

Over the years, a quiet, almost subconscious part of me had known, had prepared for a day like this.

""Excellent,"" she said, a faint smile touching her lips. ""This strengthens your case significantly.""

We discussed alimony, property division, and the daunting process ahead. It wouldn't be easy. David would fight. Ethan and Rosemary would undoubtedly side with him.

But for the first time in decades, I felt a flicker of hope, a tiny spark that maybe, just maybe, I could finally be Sabrina again. The Rina who sang on stage, the Rina who dared to dream.

“But, since its separation after a long thirty years, the Civil Court will give you a chance to think about your decision.”

“Once the time of formality passed by, I’ll send you the divorce agreement.” Mrs. Greta had added.

“Thank you, Mrs. Greta. I’ll be waiting for your call then.” I replied.

As I came back to my home, I found the house filled with constant laughter and giggling sounds.

However, the laughter came to an abrupt halt with the sound of my footsteps, everyone staring at me with disdain as if I just ruined their day just by existing in their life.

“Grandma Sabrina!” Max was the first one to acknowledge my presence, but his voice laced with mockery as he added.

“You thought we would starve to death if you didn't cook for us. But see… Grandma Kate has brought us delicious dishes.”

“They are much better than what you cook for us– plain and boring!”

“She is so selfless and kind. She booked three more tickets for the Alps as her return gift and let us join her and Grandpa David.” Max exclaimed with joy.

“Sabrina…” Kate’s voice sounded from behind. I turned to look at her, who was sitting next to David on the couch.

She walked straight to me, her voice laced with feign sorrow. “There were only three tickets left. I’m sorry, I couldn't buy any tickets for you.”



Chapter 4

I stood there, a strange calm settling over me amidst the chaos of my family’s derision and Kate’s faux sympathy.

I met Kate’s gaze, a small, knowing smile playing on my lips. “Don’t apologize, Kate,” I said, my voice clear and steady, devoid of the tremor it usually held when confronting them.

“It’s perfectly alright. I wouldn’t have been able to go anyway.”

Rosemary, who had been observing with narrowed eyes, scoffed. “Right. Too busy with your ‘appointments,’ I suppose?”

The sarcasm was thick, a venomous edge to her words.

Ethan snickered, and even David, from the couch, offered a dismissive wave of his hand, clearly enjoying the spectacle of me getting mocked by our children.

“Oh, I heard you are diagnosed with cancer?” Suddenly Kate spoke, a feign concern on her face.

“I hope everything is okay with you.” She had added, shooting a short glance at Rosemary.

It was obvious they were making fun of my sickness. They did not believe I was sick at all.

“Yes, Mom. What did your doctor say today?” Ethan asked, his voice provocative. It sounded as if he was making fun of me. Even a six years old Max knew it was some kind of a joke that was followed with his loud laughter in the hall.

“Max…” Rosemary shut him down, but deep down her expressions showed she was enjoying it as well.

I clutched the medical reports in my hands, my legs shivered in anger as I threw the reports in front of David.

“You can read it yourself and see if I’m lying. I’m really sick, David.” I spat.

I held back the tears formed in my eyes. I didn't want to shed my tears for the people who didn't even care about me. Not anymore!

Having said that, I walked up the stairs to leave for my room. That's when I heard Kate’s voice,

“I can't believe she went so far as to create fake medical reports. What the hell is wrong with her?”

“We all love you, Grandma Kate. That's why Grandma Sabrina is jealous. So, she is faking her sickness to get our attention.” Max’s voice cut deeper through my heart.

Even a child in the house didn't respect me at all!

Kate sighed, “She has always been like this. Jealous and arrogant.”

“I feel so sorry for all of you for having to tolerate her for all these years.”

I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. The words cut deep, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

Kate, David, Ethan, Rosemary, and even little Max were all ganging up on me, mocking my illness and questioning my integrity.

I thought about all the sacrifices I'd made for this family, all the times I'd put their needs before mine. And this was how they repaid me?

I walked into my room, shutting the door behind me. I leaned against the door, my heart heavy with emotion. I felt like I was alone in this family, like no one truly cared about me or my well-being.

I looked around my room, feeling like a stranger in my own home. The furniture, the decorations, everything seemed foreign to me. They were all selected by Kate. I was told– her tastes are better than mine.

Even the walls of my bedroom were filled with pictures of David and Kate together, hiking, camping, climbing the mountain, laughing and giggling. Not a single picture of mine was hung in my own bedroom. They all belonged to Kate.

I felt like I was living in a dream, a dream that was slowly turning into a nightmare.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. I knew I couldn't let their words get to me. I knew I had to be strong, for myself and for my own sake.

I had just laid in bed, recalling my doctor's warning. “You didn't follow our instructions and exhausted your body. I’m afraid you wouldn't even survive six months if you still don't give yourself rest.”

I had finally decided to not listen to anyone and live my life the best for the next six months if I had left that much time.

Suddenly the door of the room pushed open and David barged in, still carrying the medical reports in his hands.

“Are you done throwing tantrums?” He spat. “If you are done putting on an act, go pack my bag. We are leaving for the Alps tomorrow.”

Chapter 5

I barely rested for five minutes when David stood on my head, demanding to help him pack his bag for the trip I was not invited to.

I might have objected and confronted him for his audacity of being so mean if I weren't used to his behaviour.

“Polish my boots as well.” He had added before throwing the medical reports aside.

I wanted to say something, maybe resist doing the work he just handed me. But, Mrs. Greta’s words echoed through my head.

“Since it's the separation after a long period of time, the court will take time to approve your plea for the divorce.”

I sighed. I had to bear with this family a little more.

I barely managed to get my body off the bed. I dragged myself to the wardrobe, taking David’s clothes out one by one.

He watched me packing his clothes obediently. A smile of dominance spread through his lips and he left, relaxed.

I had just finished packing David's clothes when Ethan barged in the room.

“Mom, why are all my clothes wrinkled? Am I supposed to go like this on the trip?” He barked at me as if I had done a crime by not ironing his clothes on time.

“Iron them all tonight!” He commanded, followed by his wife's desperate call. “Mom, can you please wash my nighties? None of them are clean enough to take on the trip. That's not much to ask, right?”

“Of course, Mom is going to be free for a whole week. She can do some extra work today.” Ethan replied on my behalf, completely ignoring the fact that my legs were already shaking in weakness.

Without waiting for my response, they left the room. That night, Kate stayed at our home. Their laughter and giggling voice echoed through my ears for the whole night.

They stay awake the whole night, playing indoor games, watching movies and having fun. Meanwhile, the whole night I was busy packing their bags and doing all the chores necessary for the trip.

I could barely finish all the work at 5:15 AM and came to my bed to take a nap when my alarm clock rang at 5:30 AM.

I was asked to wake up early and prepare the coffee and snacks for everyone and then drive them to the Airport since the flight was at 8:00 AM.

I stared at the blaring alarm clock, the harsh buzz a cruel mockery of the five minutes of sleep I'd managed to snatch. My body screamed in protest, every muscle aching, every bone heavy.

Yet, the thought of hot coffee and fresh snacks for a family that barely acknowledged my existence, let alone my exhaustion, spurred me on.

I pushed myself up. The kitchen was a mess, as expected. Empty snack wrappers littered the counters, and half-eaten bowls of cereal sat hardening on the table.

I moved like a ghost, mechanically grinding coffee beans, the rich aroma doing little to awaken my senses.

My hands trembled as I sliced fruit and arranged pastries, my mind replaying Mrs. Greta’s words: ""Since it's the separation after a long period of time, the court will take time to approve your plea for the divorce.""

A little more. I just had to bear it a little more.

At 6:30 AM, just as the first rays of dawn stretched through the kitchen window, I heard the creak of floorboards above.

David's booming voice, followed by Kate’s airy giggle, signaled the start of their day. Soon, Ethan and Rosemary joined them, their morning chatter filling the house with an energy I couldn't match.

After the coffee and snacks, I drove them to the Airport where they walked hand in hand and I carried their luggage as their personal maid.

As if something hit David, he finally walked up to me and said, his voice gentle for once. “You are so sick, Sabrina. It's not good for your health to travel.”

“After I return from Alps, I’ll take you to see a good doctor and then we will arrange another trip, just you and I.” He had added when his attention got diverted by Kate’s scream.

“Oh, No!” She yelled, “The diamond ring you gave me yesterday is missing.”

She showed her empty finger to David. David's forehead wrinkled. “Where did it go?”

“I don't know.” She shook her head. “Could it be that it's stolen?”

“Grandma Sabrina, did you steal it from Grandma Kate’s finger?” Max’s childish accusations sent shivers down my spine.

The most shocking thing was no one moved to correct him, to defend me. Their gaze instead was fixed on me while Max was standing before me, crossing his arms against his chest. “You wanted it after all, didn’t you?”

Kate dramatically clutched her empty finger. “I can't go bare finger. What will people talk about me?”

David’s eyes turned to me. His eyes sparkled as he stared the only diamond ring I had that I had been wearing since before our wedding.

“Sabrina, give your ring to Kate. It's so expensive. What will do you wearing it? You don't go anywhere.” He had said, completely ignoring the emotion behind my ring.

“That's my mother's ring, David!” I spat. “I’m not giving it to anyone.”

My strict refusal triggered his anger, and the next second I found myself laying on the floor.

My sight was blurred and I couldn't remember what had happened in this minute time. I tried to get up, but fell again.

The ring, the symbol of my mother’s love, sparkled in Kate's finger, a hand imprinted on my cheeks and a lot of sympathetic stares directed at me, told me the tale of what happened just seconds ago.

David had slapped me before everyone, snatched the fingers off my finger and gave it to Kate.

“You should feel entitled that I’m not calling police for stealing Kate's ring.” He had added before turning his back at me.

“Serves you right.” Rosemary smirked as she left with Ethan. Max's teased me with funny faces as he followed his parents. No one came to support me or ask I how had I been feeling.

A passerby helped me get up while I stared my family happily boarding for the flight.

Just then my phone rang. It was Mrs. Greta.

“Congratulations, Mrs. Cooper. Your plea for the divorce has been accepted.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Greta!” I said, my voice stern.

I had just hung up the call that my phone rang again, this time with an unfamiliar number. I picked it up only to listen an old friend’s voice.

“Rina, how are you doing these days?” The voice asked excitedly.

“Just fine.” I replied. “How did you call me after so many years?”

“I have a great news for you. My company is launching a program inviting old super stars that are forgotten to shine. You are on the list, Rina.”

“The program is going to be held on Alps, a place you always wanted to visit. I remember it.”

“What's the last date of joining this program?” I asked as I had some matters to be taken care of before leaving this country for good.

“ A week…”

“I accept your invitation.” I replied, my voice laced with confidence that I never showed before.

This was my time to shine!



Chapter 6

As I watched my family disappear into the distance, I felt a sense of relief throughout my body. I was finally free from their toxic grasp, and I could start rebuilding my life.

The phone call from Mrs. Greta was the confirmation I needed. My divorce had been accepted, and I was one step closer to starting anew. The call from my old friend was the perfect distraction from the chaos that had just unfolded.

Years ago, I was a famous singer. My concerts were famous across several countries. I had once urged David to visit my concert once. But, he had refused coldly.

""Singing? That's not a real profession, Sabrina. It's just a hobby, something you do for fun. You need a stable job, something that can provide for our future. This singing nonsense is just a waste of time."" David said, his voice laced with disdain.

I felt a pang of hurt at his words, but I tried to brush it off. ""You don't understand, David. Music is my passion. It's what makes me happy.""

David scoffed. ""Happy? You call performing in front of a crowd of screaming fans happy? It's just a bunch of noise, Sabrina. You need to focus on something more practical.”

Thereafter, I left singing. I disappeared from the world that once made me feel alive.

But, I didn't expect the opportunity to present itself. A chance to revive my singing career, to shine again on stage, and to do what I loved.

The program was being held in the Alps, a place I had always dreamed of visiting.

I wasted no time. Despite feeling my bones aching because of David's abuse, a new energy emitted from my heart and I rushed back home.

Mrs. Greta had someone deliver the divorce papers at home as she promised. I signed the papers immediately and took care of the necessary arrangements before leaving the country.

I dumped all the decorations and furniture in the house outside, along with all the photo frames that didn't contain me, sold the house, severing ties with the past and the painful memories that lingered within its walls.

The money I got by selling the house I once bought with my life savings just for the family, was enough to live the best of my life for the rest of the six months.

I visited the shopping mall where David used to take Kate shopping.

“The dresses here are all fashionable and warm. You stay at home and do household chores. What will you do visiting this mall?”

That's what he had said when I had urged him to take me along as well.

But today, I bought all the dresses that I once wished to wear but couldn't. They all looked perfect on me. I bought matching accessories as well.

No one mocked me, no one looked down on me. Everyone in the mall appreciated my taste, some even asked me to help them in selecting their dresses.

The day of my departure arrived, and I stood in front of the mirror, looking at the person staring back at me. I was no longer the timid, submissive woman I once was. I was a woman reborn, ready to take on the world.

I took a deep breath, grabbed my bags, and stepped out into the unknown. Just before boarding, my phone rang. I checked it. It was Kate.

I ignored it. But, my phone kept beeping, attracting a few stares of people at me. I sighed and immediately checked my phone.

Kate had been sending messages on my social media app. Those were all the pictures of her visiting exciting places in the Alps. David stood by her side, affectionately holding her arms in all of them.

There were videos as well. Ethan called her ‘Mom’ in them. Max called her just ‘Grandma’ and David, well he was addressing her as ‘Darling’.

She even made a post of herself and David, with the caption: ""Love is in the air. Wishing my dear Sabrina could find happiness like I've found with David.”

I liked the post and commented ‘Advice accepted’.

After that, I blocked her number along with four more numbers of my family and shut the phone off. It was time to leave. The Alps awaited, and with it, a new chapter in my life. I was ready to shine, to sing, and to live.

What awaits my ex-husband and his family is not me, but a divorce settlement and homelessness. It's time they learned their lesson!",1,1753279348.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

My phone was down to 7%, and every charging station in sight was either taken or broken. I finally found an outlet tucked behind a row of seats and was just about to plug in when I heard someone behind me sigh and say, “You too, huh?”

It was a woman about my mom’s age, clearly flustered, holding her dead phone like it betrayed her. I had a dual-port charger, so I told her, “If you’ve got a cable, we can share.” She smiled, pulled out her cord, and we both sat on the floor like it was normal behavior.

We started chatting to pass the time  turns out she was a senior executive at a tech startup, flying home from a conference. I mentioned I’d just finished my degree in digital marketing and was hunting for entry-level roles. She asked a few questions, gave me some advice, and then handed me her business card.

Didn’t think much of it until I emailed her a thank-you the next day. She replied saying she’d enjoyed the conversation and offered to set up a virtual coffee chat. Long story short, we’ve been talking weekly since, and she’s now mentoring me through my job search. She’s even connected me to a couple of hiring managers.

All that just because I had an extra port and didn’t mind sharing a charger.

1m7a1yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1m7a1yf/lunch_at_henrys/,Lunch at Henry's,"The locals in Henry’s Diner share an unsettling and unspoken bond as they seem to communicate telepathically amongst themselves. Even though they're deeply involved in their own private conversations, they are collectively singling me out, furious that an outsider would dare enter their world.

Their plates and glasses clatter noisily. Silverware scrapes across plates in sharp, high-pitched screeches that cut through the air, making my teeth clench and my shoulders tighten. The din of their silent conversations drones on like a swarm of angry hornets.

I stand alone by the door, shivering to shake off the cold.

""Mommy, he's not one of us,"" echoes a little girl's voice in my head. I turn to see her slurping a strawberry shake. Her blonde hair is tied in pigtails. Freckles dot her cheeks and nose. Her blue eyes are mean and narrow.

""Get out now!"" growls a burly trucker as he takes a bite of his pastrami on rye. His voice booms through my skull like an ancient Chinese gong. A chill runs up my spine that has nothing to do with the cold.

""Smoking or non?"" barks the beefy waitress who suddenly appears before me. Her matted hair is tucked haphazardly under her hair net. Her stained apron reeks of coffee, grease, and overripe blueberries. She reaches behind the counter for a menu, her expression blank, her lips tight. I start to answer, but she interrupts.

""If you come in here, they'll kill you,"" her thoughts hiss. ""Outsiders ain't welcome here.""

""How do you think this one will taste, mama?"" asks the little girl with the strawberry shake.

""Looks pretty tender to me,"" answers a frail man sitting in the back corner, slowly stirring his coffee.

""Got a good solid build,"" echoes a blue-haired old woman, ""Should be damn good eatin'.""

Confused, I start to back away. The waitress smiles and opens the menu. I see myself in the picture, chopped and cooked. My arms are sticking out of a large pot of boiling water, and my legs are roasting a golden-brown in the oven. My head rests inside a cake box, eyes wide with terror, a silent scream frozen on my face.

I turn quickly and push hard on the door in a desperate attempt to escape. My head buzzes with a hundred deafening voices. 

The door is locked.

Instantly, they are upon me. I feel the sting of the butcher’s knife as it enters the side of my neck.

I sit quietly in my booth, uncaring, unfeeling. The marshmallows in my cup of hot chocolate have almost completely melted.

I wait.

The front door finally opens and a father walks in with his young son. They stand by the door looking confused, like something is happening that shouldn't be happening.

I reach under the table and wrap my fingers around the handle of my butcher’s knife.

""Let's eat,"" I command silently to the other patrons.

And we are upon them.",2,1753279263.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 - Almost


The tires of Colt Bennett’s old truck crunched on the gravel as he parked outside Gracie’s Café. He turned off the engine and sat still for a moment, staring through the windshield.

Stillwater Ridge hadn’t changed much.

The same old shops lined Main Street. The gas station sign still hung slightly crooked. A couple of kids rode their bikes down the sidewalk, yelling something to each other that he couldn’t quite hear. Everything looked just like it had when he left twelve years ago—and somehow, that made it feel heavier.

Colt leaned back in his seat and let out a slow breath. He wasn’t sure why coming back made him feel like he was seventeen again. Maybe it was because the last time he’d been here, he left without saying goodbye to most people. Especially her.

He grabbed his cap off the dash, opened the door, and stepped out into the warm afternoon air. The café door creaked when he pulled it open, and the little bell above it gave a soft ring.

Inside, it was cool and quiet. The smell of coffee and fresh cornbread filled the space. A couple of older men sat by the window, drinking slowly and talking low.

Gracie looked up from behind the counter. She froze for half a second before smiling.

“Well, look who it is,” she said. “Colt Bennett. Thought you forgot about this place.”

He smiled a little, not sure what to say. “Figured I’d check if your coffee’s still as good as I remember.”

Gracie chuckled. “Still bitter and too hot. Just like always.” She poured a cup and slid it to him.

He took a sip. It burned his tongue, but somehow, it tasted right.

And then she walked in.

Sadie Walker.

She stepped out from the back carrying a tray of cornbread. Her hair was tied up, and she wore jeans and a plain T-shirt. She looked almost exactly like he remembered—just a little older, a little quieter.

She didn’t see him at first. She was talking to Gracie, smiling a little at something, her voice soft and steady. That voice used to calm him down without trying.

Then she looked up. Her eyes met his.

Sadie stopped for just a second. Not long enough for anyone else to notice, but Colt did. He always noticed her.

“Sadie,” he said, nodding once.

She looked at him without smiling. “Didn’t know you were back.”

“Just got in.”

She shifted the tray in her hands. “How long are you staying?”

Colt shrugged. “Not sure yet.”

There was a short silence between them. Not cold, but not warm either. Just be careful.

“Well,” she said, her tone neutral, “hope your coffee’s still good.”

Then she turned and walked through the swinging door into the kitchen.

Colt stared at the door for a long moment after it stopped moving. He wasn’t sure what he had expected—anger, maybe. A smile, maybe. But that quiet look in her eyes? That was worse somehow.

She used to be almost his.

And now, she felt farther away than ever.

I walked around and could hear a knocking noise and a sort of moan-y sound from below. I went to go see some an older guy waiting outside of an apartment. He told me his girlfriend was inside with another guy. 

I looking around him to see if he had anything that could used to hurt someone but he didn't have anything. When asking him why he is there, you can see utter sadness in his red and watery eyes. He told me they'd been together for a year and she told him she wasn't seeing anyone. 

My main concern is safety first but you could see a broken man who wants ""closure"". Real closure doesn't come from asking people to pretend to apologize, I told him. 


What good does it do if he lingers there? 

He's still there right now sitting on the floor with his back against the wall. 

I'm making a pot of coffee and will take some down for us both to talk. I'm trying to talk him out of here and also away from her or her secret bf. Coffee's brewing right now. I want to get this guy out of here and make sure he moves on for himself otherwise I'm just going to have to call out and report trespassing. He's lucky I'm talking to him. But I'm sure a lot of guys have been in his situation. 

He needs to let her go free in a way that she'd feel his absence. His excuse will be how much better he takes care of himself. I wrote down some phone numbers to give him for free help as well as mine if he needs a gym buddy should he have a free guest pass at his because I don't.

Inside, it was cool and quiet. The smell of coffee and fresh cornbread filled the space. A couple of older men sat by the window, drinking slowly and talking low.

Gracie looked up from behind the counter. She froze for half a second before smiling.

“Well, look who it is,” she said. “Colt Bennett. Thought you forgot about this place.”

He smiled a little, not sure what to say. “Figured I’d check if your coffee’s still as good as I remember.”

Gracie chuckled. “Still bitter and too hot. Just like always.” She poured a cup and slid it to him.

He took a sip. It burned his tongue, but somehow, it tasted right.

And then she walked in.

Sadie Walker.

She stepped out from the back carrying a tray of cornbread. Her hair was tied up, and she wore jeans and a plain T-shirt. She looked almost exactly like he remembered—just a little older, a little quieter.

She didn’t see him at first. She was talking to Gracie, smiling a little at something, her voice soft and steady. That voice used to calm him down without trying.

Then she looked up. Her eyes met his.

Sadie stopped for just a second. Not long enough for anyone else to notice, but Colt did. He always noticed her.

“Sadie,” he said, nodding once.

She looked at him without smiling. “Didn’t know you were back.”

“Just got in.”

She shifted the tray in her hands. “How long are you staying?”

Colt shrugged. “Not sure yet.”

There was a short silence between them. Not cold, but not warm either. Just be careful.

“Well,” she said, her tone neutral, “hope your coffee’s still good.”

Then she turned and walked through the swinging door into the kitchen.

Colt stared at the door for a long moment after it stopped moving. He wasn’t sure what he had expected—anger, maybe. A smile, maybe. But that quiet look in her eyes? That was worse somehow.

She used to be almost his.

And now, she felt farther away than ever.

1m79rq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1m79rq3/does_arm_hammer_natural_detergent_booster_really/,Does Arm & Hammer Natural Detergent Booster Really Improve Laundry Cleaning Performance? Review,"Testing out the **Arm & Hammer Natural Detergent Booster and Household Cleaner** over the past couple of weeks has been enlightening, not only as someone who takes on laundry duties at home but also as someone who occasionally spills coffee or ketchup on their favorite shirt. The product, identified with the model number B01MQDCATU, is a multitasker, claiming to double as both a natural detergent booster and a general household cleaner. Between its impressive reputation and the claim that it's been ""pure and natural since 1874,"" I felt both curious and a little skeptical. Here’s my honest take, based on putting it to the test across various settings.

**Design and Overall Usability**  
The packaging of this detergent booster isn't exactly a showstopper, but it’s functional. It’s a large 55-ounce box that’s solid enough to store in my laundry cabinet without worries of accidental leaks or spills. The lid seals quite securely, which gives me an extra sense of assurance—especially since powdered products can get messy if they’re not stored properly. While the product dimensions (6.5 x 9.5 x 2.5 inches) make it compact, lifting its 3.94-pound weight can feel hefty during frequent use. On the upside, the scoop it comes with makes dosage straightforward and eliminates any guesswork.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
I must admit, I threw everything at this product in terms of testing. From my gym clothes that carry a little more ""personality"" than I’d like to admit to kitchen towels soaked in greasy messes, the product didn't disappoint. It claims to improve liquid detergent performance by up to 15%, and I noticed that my whites genuinely looked brighter after regular use. Mustard and blood stains (yep, I’m clumsy) vanished quicker when using this as a supplement to my regular detergent. Its ability to neutralize odors was solid too—coffee spills on my beige carpet didn't leave behind any lingering smell.

**Strengths**  
The product brings a lot to the table, especially for people searching for a ""natural"" alternative to harsher chemical-based cleaning agents.  
- Free from phosphates and artificial fragrances, making it suitable for families with sensitive skin.  
- Doubles as an indoor-outdoor cleaner, effective on hard surfaces like countertops or patio furniture.
- Ideal for odor elimination without relying on strong artificial scents.
- Versatile—worked well on laundry, tiles, and even as part of a DIY cleaning solution for the bathroom.  

**Hurdles**  
Despite its many merits, the product isn’t without flaws, especially when held up to frequent or extensive use.  
- Takes some trial and error to find the optimal mixing ratio, particularly when cleaning surfaces (too little feels ineffective; too much can leave a gritty residue).  
- Not all stains are created equal—while most laundry stains were handled efficiently, grease stains on my sofa fabric required extra effort and a separate stain remover.  
- Though listed as unscented, its natural chemical smell might be noticeable to some users, especially if you’re expecting it to be completely odorless.  

**Competing Products to Consider**  
While this detergent booster stands tall in the market, there are a few compelling alternatives worth exploring. One such product is OxiClean White Revive Laundry Whitener + Stain Remover. It offers a similar powdered form for boosting laundry detergent and performs well on whites. However, it tends to have a harsher composition with no emphasis on being fragrance or phosphate-free, which could pose concerns for sensitive users. 

Another rival is the Seventh Generation Free & Clear Stain Remover, which is also geared toward eco-conscious consumers. While it holds its own in elemental attributes, the Seventh Generation product doesn't double as a household cleaner, which limits its versatility. Comparatively, the multifunctional nature of the product in question truly shines. One area where alternatives might excel, though, would be in terms of specific single-purpose stain removal capabilities.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its price-to-quality ratio, this detergent booster offers substantial value to big households or avid cleaners. The 55-ounce unit stretches over weeks of consistent use, and its multi-purpose capability eliminates the need to purchase separate products for surface cleaning or freshening up upholstery. While pricing isn’t mentioned explicitly, its moderate-to-premium cost is justified when factoring in the balance of longevity, safety, and performance. The unscented, phosphate-free appeal is particularly worth every penny to families prioritizing both effective stain-fighting and a gentler eco footprint.

It really feels like stepping on his memory and simply carrying on as if he never existed. Living with people who aren't him, sleeping alone instead of together in the same bed.

She could hear the doctor's desperate voice trying to stop what was happening...

""Mr. Seibert, if you keep pushing her like this, Ms. Caylor's body will completely collapse!""

The room fell into an eerie silence, but as long as Vincent didn't say stop, nobody dared to remove the needle.

Alice stared at her blood pouring through the tube as her body grew colder little by little, and her eyes started to lose focus as darkness closed in.

Her breathing grew shallower and slower, and just as she was about to lose consciousness, she heard Vincent's cold voice. ""Keep going. Juliana can't wait any longer.""

Right then, she finally realized she had always just been a living medicine for that woman.

When she next opened her eyes, she found herself back five years earlier—on the very day she was forced into the phlebotomy room for the first time.

A cold needle stabbed into her spine, making her fingers quiver from the sharp pain. The nurse noticed her pale face and hesitated before asking, ""Ms. Caylor, this surgery is very dangerous. Are you... Really willing to do this?""

Before the nurse could finish, a low and cold voice sounded from the doorway. ""She is, of course.""

Alice slowly lifted her head and locked eyes with Vincent's cold, merciless gaze.

Memories of everything she had suffered came rushing back.

She had loved him for 12 long years, but all he did in return was hold his beloved crush close and tell the doctor, ""I don't care if you drain every drop of her blood.""

In her previous life, it was at the high school freshman opening ceremony that she first fell for Vincent, who stood confidently on the podium giving a speech.

She spent three years chasing after him, brought him breakfast every single day for a year, stayed with him in the library until midnight to help him study, and even carried him to the school clinic when he hurt himself playing basketball.

But Vincent always kept a cold distance from her, and he even gave back the love letter she had poured her heart into without bothering to read it.

When she finally worked hard enough to get accepted into his college, she saw him holding Juliana Flynn's hand during the opening ceremony, boldly declaring in front of all the teachers and students, ""This is the only person I will ever love.""

People around her whispered that Vincent had truly fallen for Juliana and urged Alice to move on as soon as she could.

But no matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't let go.

She saw him waiting outside the girls' dormitory in the pouring rain all night long, hoping the sick Juliana would forgive him.

She watched him smash a priceless emerald necklace into pieces only because Juliana said, ""I hate feeling tied down by things like this.""

She also witnessed him set off a multimillion-dollar fireworks show on the rooftop of the Seibert Group's building to celebrate Juliana's birthday, making sure the entire city saw how crazy he was about her.

Alice felt like a pitiful outsider, silently observing this intense love story but unable to leave even the smallest mark in his heart.

So when Vincent begged her to save Juliana for the first time, she somehow found herself asking him to marry her instead.

""She can still vividly recall how red his eyes were that day.

His shock, shame, and resistance eventually turned into hopeless acceptance.""

He told her, ""Fine, if being Mrs. Seibert is what you want, I'll let you have it. But you need to go donate your blood now.""

Later on, she did end up becoming his wife, like she had always dreamed.

But what did it even matter?

Their marriage certificate was kept locked away in a safe, but his heart remained forever with Juliana.

Every corner of the house was filled with photos of Juliana, even the nightstand in the main bedroom held a framed picture of her.

Whenever Vincent touched Alice, he whispered Juliana's name instead of hers.

In the end, he personally forced her onto the surgery table, ignoring whether she lived or died, and took every drop of her blood to save Juliana.

As the anesthetic started flowing into her veins, Alice finally understood how foolish she had been.

She had made a terrible mistake.

Vincent's heart only ever truly belonged to Juliana.

She should never have trapped him in a marriage by using such cruel tricks.

She finally realized that his kindness was always meant only for Juliana.

She shouldn't have been so naive to think a marriage certificate could make him stay.

A relationship built on force will always be filled with pain.

But she only came to see this after she lost her life.

\*\*\*

As she drifted in and out of her memories, the blood bag had already filled up.

Vincent picked up the blood bag and turned to walk out, but Alice called out to stop him, ""Our marriage...""

He halted, his tone annoyed as he replied, ""Don't worry, I'll keep my word. Everything's set up at the City Hall. You can go by yourself later.""

Alice thought back to her previous life, when she stood all alone outside the City Hall, clutching the marriage certificate and crying helplessly.

There had been no wedding ceremony, no honeymoon, not even a simple pair of wedding rings.

Watching Vincent's figure as he moved to leave, she slowly shook her head. ""That's not what I meant.""

She wanted to put an end to this absurd marriage.

In this lifetime, she would never fall in love with him again.

But right as she was about to walk away, a nurse called after her, ""Miss, don't forget your bag!""

Alice reached to grab it but didn't get a good grip, and the bag slipped from her hands onto the floor.

All the items inside spilled out everywhere, and as she squatted down to pick them up, she was shocked to find Juliana's ID card and a stack of legal documents.

It was only then that she recognized the unfamiliar designer bag as Juliana's.

A wild thought suddenly popped into her head.

About 30 minutes later, she stepped out of the City Hall holding a newly issued marriage certificate.

Two names were printed clearly on the certificate: Vincent and Juliana.

As she looked at the freshly signed marriage certificate, she finally let out a calm, relieved smile.

In this lifetime, she had personally delivered the woman he loved back into his arms.

And now, she could completely step away from this ridiculous love triangle drama.

**Chapter 2**

After leaving the City Hall, Alice tried calling Vincent over ten times, but he never picked up.

Feeling weak from losing too much blood, she almost collapsed and had no choice but to head home to rest.

The following day, she pushed herself to visit the hospital again.

Through the glass window of the hospital room, she saw Vincent gently helping Juliana sit upright, like he was handling something incredibly delicate.

""Eat slowly, it's hot.""

He softly blew on the oatmeal in the spoon, his eyes filled with a tenderness she had never seen before.

Alice suddenly remembered that in her previous life, when she was lying in bed with a fever reaching 39.8 degrees Celsius, even a glass of water had to be poured by a nurse, because no one else did.

She took a long breath outside the hospital room, then lightly tapped on the door.

When Vincent turned and saw her, the warmth in his face instantly disappeared.

He rushed outside, closed the door behind him, and stared at her, eyes red with anger.

""Are you stalking me?""

Alice calmly held out the unfamiliar designer bag and a marriage certificate.

""I just came to give these back, and also to let you know...""

""Enough!"" he cut her off before she could finish.

He yanked the bag from her hand and hissed, ""Juliana can't handle any stress right now. If you dare say even a single word—""

Alice interrupted him, ""It's not about us. The marriage certificate clearly shows you and—""

""Alice!""

Suddenly, Vincent grabbed her by the wrist.

""Don't think you can use this to threaten me!

""If it weren't for Juliana, I wouldn't even bother talking to you!""

He yanked the marriage certificate from her hand and shoved it into his suit pocket without even glancing at it. Then, without another word, he turned around and headed back into the hospital room.

As the door clicked shut, Alice could still hear Juliana's soft voice from inside. ""Vincent, who was that?""

""Just a delivery person,"" he replied.

Alice stared at the closed door and let out a quiet laugh.

She thought to herself, ""Well, once he realizes the name on that marriage certificate, his reaction will be priceless.""

She didn't bother staying any longer. She had already made up her mind to leave, and sooner or later, he'd find out the truth written on that document.

Without slowing down, she stepped into the elevator and pressed the button.

Inside, a few young nurses were chatting in hushed voices, visibly excited.

""The guy in the VIP room is the heir of the Seibert Group! I heard he flew in an elite medical team from overseas just to save his girlfriend!""

Another nurse whispered, ""That's not all. I heard his girlfriend needed a rare blood type, and guess what? He found someone who matched, and they took nearly 2,000 ml of her blood!""

""Oh my God, that's next-level devotion!""

Alice stood silently off to the side, her fingers digging into her palms without her realizing it.

Yes, he was devoted—deeply so.

For Juliana, he was willing to give up everything, even marry a woman he didn't love.

But this time, she wouldn't give him that chance again.

As she walked out of the hospital and tilted her head up toward the sun, the bright light made her eyes sting.

She waved a taxi by the roadside. ""To the embassy,"" she said.

In her previous life, she turned down her acceptance to the OCAD University in Canada just to stay close to Vincent and always be on call as his personal ""blood bank.""

But this time, she was determined to chase the dream she had abandoned for too long.

""All your documents are in order,"" the visa officer said, adjusting his glasses. ""You'll hear back within two weeks.""

Alice noted the time needed for her visa to be approved, left the embassy, hailed another taxi, and headed back.

Once she got home, she started going through all the memories she had collected about Vincent over the years.

Back in high school, she used to secretly save his old homework sheets.

During college, she quietly filmed him whenever he played sports.

She even kept the ticket from the only ""date"" they had after getting married.

From falling for him at 15 to passing away in surgery at 27, she had loved him for 12 years. But in return, all she got was a cold sentence, ""I don't care if you drain every drop of her blood.""

After two long days of packing, when the last box was carried to the front door, Alice suddenly noticed it was raining.

""Miss, are you sure you want to throw all of this away?"" the housekeeper asked, uncertain, holding an umbrella over her.

""Yes, all of it,"" she replied.

The words had barely left her mouth when a pair of blinding headlights flashed through the rain.

A black Maybach stopped harshly in front of the gate, splashing water that soaked the hem of her clothes.

The window rolled down, and Vincent's cold face looked even sharper in the rain.

""You're really in a rush,"" he said, glancing at the boxes. His tone was colder than the rain. ""Juliana just got out of the hospital; she needs peace and quiet. Don't go bothering her with this trash.""

Alice froze for a second, then suddenly burst out laughing.

""No need to worry, Mr. Seibert. These are heading straight to the garbage dump. I never planned on bringing them to your place...""

""As long as you're not taking them there, I don't care where they end up. Get in the car,"" Vincent cut her off, giving the driver the signal to unlock the back door. Alice looked at him, puzzled. A flicker of confusion crossed her face. She asked, ""Where are we going?""

**Chapter 3**

""Professor Lukyn saw you the last time you went to the City Hall,"" Vincent said, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel, his tone sharp and distant.

""Juliana will be at the alumni gathering tonight. Come with me and clear things up.""

That's when Alice remembered how, in her previous life, she got too excited during the alumni gathering and shared a photo of their marriage certificate with her classmates.

That night ended with Juliana throwing a tantrum in front of Vincent.

Now, in this life, even though she hadn't done anything, she still couldn't avoid the same mess.

She replied calmly, ""Alright.

""I'll explain everything.""

The black Maybach stopped in front of a five-star hotel. Without saying a word, Vincent grabbed her wrist and hurried her toward the banquet hall.

Suddenly, as they passed a corner, he pushed her against the wall and looked at her with warning in his eyes.

""Say you were helping your cousin with some documents. If you say anything else...""

""I get it,"" Alice cut him off, clearly uninterested in hearing more.

""Don't worry. I won't let anyone think we're married.""

After all, it was Juliana's name written clearly on that marriage certificate. She was just returning it to its rightful owner.

Once he heard her promise, Vincent released her and walked ahead into the banquet hall.

He said, ""Juliana is right over there, so go talk to the others first.""

As soon as she opened the doors to the golden banquet hall, loud voices and shouts instantly filled the air around her.

""Alice!""

Her old college class representative was the first to rush up to her.

""The group chat is blowing up—people are saying you and Vincent were seen at the City Hall!""

""We've all heard the rumors!"" the arts representative said, eagerly waving her phone. ""You really kept it a secret from us!""

A group of seven or eight girls quickly circled around her, their voices excited. ""Hey, bride-to-be! Come on, spill it! When's the wedding?""

Alice's eyes drifted toward Vincent, who wasn't far away.

She saw him carefully draping a coat over Juliana's shoulders, while Juliana tightly gripped the edge of his sleeve with her pale fingers.

""That's not true!"" Alice suddenly raised her voice, loud enough for Vincent to hear clearly.

""I only went there to drop off my cousin's ID card. It wasn't me getting married.""

""Drop off your cousin's ID? Come on, who would believe that?""

One of Alice's old college roommates wrapped an arm around her shoulder.

""Back in junior year, you had a high fever and still brought Vincent an umbrella in the rain. You ended up in the hospital with pneumonia for a week.""

""And during graduation, you drank to stop him from drinking too much and landed in the emergency room with alcohol poisoning...""

Alice faintly remembered the time she almost died from alcohol poisoning, but what stuck with her the most was hearing Vincent say to Juliana through the hospital window, ""See? This is what happens when you insist on pestering me.""

But now, she was only 22, just six months out of college, and she still had her whole future ahead of her. Since life had given her a second chance, she had no interest in getting involved with Vincent ever again. She reached into her bag, pulled out the single status affidavit she had brought along, and showed everyone the part that clearly said ""single"" under the statement. Once they saw it, they finally believed she wasn't married. A few people looked surprised. After reading it, the arts representative suddenly said, ""Wait... then who did Vincent go to the City Hall with?""

""Probably Juliana!"" someone nearby jumped in right away, excitedly.

""Remember how at the college's opening ceremony, he said he'd never marry anyone else but her?""

""But Juliana's family..."" the class representative muttered, lowering his voice.

""Her dad took his own life last year because of gambling, and her mom's still in a psychiatric hospital. There's no way the Seibert family would accept that...""

""You don't get it!"" Vincent's roommate cut in quickly, clearly worked up.

""Vincent's been running the Seibert Group for a while now!

""Last year, he even froze the family investment fund just for Juliana—forced Sir Seibert to personally get her mom out of the psychiatric hospital for treatment!""

Alice stood there listening to all of this, and suddenly, she found the whole situation laughable.

Everyone else had seen the truth clearly, but she was the only one who naively believed that the guy who broke her heart would ever come back to her.

Just then, Vincent showed up with Juliana by his side. Juliana glanced around, puzzled by what was going on.

""Propose? What do you mean, propose?""

A sudden thought seemed to hit her, and her heart started beating faster. She quickly turned toward Vincent, her eyes full of hope.

""Vincent... are you about to propose to me?""

Vincent almost said ""no,"" but when he saw the hope on Juliana's face, he couldn't bring himself to say it.

He was aware that she had always dreamed of him proposing, but the truth was, he had already legally married Alice. There was no way he could become Juliana's husband now.

He wanted her to keep living and smiling, but he didn't want to be the reason behind her crushed hopes.

After thinking for a moment, he glanced over at Alice, then turned back and gave a slight nod.

""Yes, Juliana... I do want to propose to you.""

**Chapter 4**

As soon as the words left Vincent's mouth, the banquet hall broke into chaos.

""Do it now! Do it!""

The entire hall erupted with loud cheers and excitement.

In the middle of the noise, Vincent's eyes wandered toward a quiet corner.

Alice sat quietly, looking down at her phone, the screen's cold light hiding her expression.

He spoke in a tight voice, ""It's all too sudden.

""I haven't even got the ring ready...""

""You're all I need!"" Before he could finish, Juliana threw herself into his embrace, crying into his shirt.

From the side, Alice watched them hug, her fingers digging painfully into her hands.

It looked exactly the same as before—except last time, she had been alone at the bridal shop, putting on the wedding dress Juliana didn't want.

""Give me 30 minutes.""

Vincent pulled out his phone and dialed his assistant.

Soon, the banquet hall turned into a full-on proposal setup.

The floor was filled with rose petals, and the champagne glasses sparkled under the lights.

Juliana wore the wedding gown the assistant had brought, shaking with joy.

Suddenly, she rushed over to Alice and handed him a camera. ""Alice...

""Can you help us capture this special moment?""

""Sure,"" Alice replied casually.

As soon as Vincent heard her agree, his grip on the phone tightened slightly.

He expected her to scoff, smash the camera, or say something sharp, just like she often did before.

Instead, she calmly accepted it and even gave a small smile. ""Don't worry, I'll make sure the photos turn out great.""

Her strange politeness made him feel even more uneasy inside.

Just before the proposal started, he couldn't stop himself from sending her a text.

""Alice, I know exactly what you're up to!

""If anything happens to Juliana, I swear you'll regret it.""

The notification sound was almost drowned out by the noisy crowd.

Alice glanced at her phone. The lock screen reflected a blurred image of herself, pale and quiet, like an old photograph faded by time.

She flipped the phone face down in her palm, but when she lifted the camera, her hands were steady.

Through the lens, Vincent's white suit glowed warmly under the light.

He walked toward Juliana, holding a bouquet of roses—every step echoing memories that still lived in Alice's mind.

""The moment I saw you, I just knew.""

When Vincent knelt down on one knee, the small click of the ring box opening made Alice's fingers tremble.

The way he looked up at Juliana was so gentle that it pulled her back to her previous life, to the marriage certificate she had once tucked away in a safe.

The certificate was the same, but the name written on it was no longer hers.

As the crowd burst into loud celebration, Alice watched through the camera as Juliana leaped into Vincent's arms.

He lost his balance for a second but smiled and hugged her even closer.

The camera caught it all without missing a beat.

The fabric of his trousers pulled tight as he leaned in, his lashes trembling faintly as their lips met.

There was also the glimmering fragments of light refracted from the diamond on Juliana's ring finger.

After lowering the camera, Alice noticed a small crescent mark left on his hand.

She saw the couple hugging, surrounded by a laughing and cheering crowd, and a quiet smile appeared on her face.

At this grand ceremony, she finally understood how to be a proper bystander.

Alice respectfully gave the camera to Juliana, wearing a polite expression.

""Congratulations—""

But before Alice could say anything more, a loud scream came from behind.

She didn't even get the chance to turn before someone shoved her hard.

She stumbled forward and smashed into the champagne glasses.

Crash!

The sound of the breaking glass made her ears ring.

Cold wine mixed with blood spread beneath her like a blooming stain, and sharp stinging pain shot through her arms and legs.

She slowly forced her eyes open, and through her hazy sight, she noticed Vincent anxiously checking if Juliana was okay.

""Don't worry, Juliana. I shoved her to protect you. You're not hurt, right?""

Those words felt like sharp glass stabbing straight into her heart.

Alice wanted to laugh, but the tears running down her lips tasted bitter and salty.

So this was how he saw her, not even as a living, breathing person, just something he could throw in front of danger when it mattered most.

Her mind started to go blank, and the loud voices around her grew quieter and more distant.

Right before she blacked out completely, she faintly recalled the marriage certificate in her previous life.

How ridiculous!

**Chapter 5**

Alice slowly opened her eyes, and through the bright white light, she saw the nurse's worried expression.

""Are you awake?""

She carefully fixed the IV line and asked, ""Would you like me to call someone? Maybe your husband or your parents?""

Alice's dry lips trembled, and her voice came out rough like sand scraping wood. ""No need. My parents passed away years ago, and I'm not married...""

Before she could finish, someone suddenly slammed the hospital room door open.

Vincent stood there, backlit by the hallway lights. His suit didn't match the clean, sterile smell around him.

""Not married?""

He let out a cold laugh, the sound of his shoes clicking sharply across the floor tile.

""Then who was the one begging me to get a marriage certificate just last week?""

Alice turned her face to the side, avoiding his intense stare. ""Mr. Seibert, maybe you should go check the marriage certificate again...""

""What are you trying to pull now?""

Vincent tugged at his collar, frustration flashing in his eyes.

""If Juliana didn't need your blood type, do you honestly think I'd even notice you?""

The heart monitor suddenly sped up, beeping louder.

Alice's eyes drifted to the maple leaves gently falling outside the window. Her voice came out soft, almost like a sigh. ""Think whatever you want... Whatever's going on between the two of you... It has nothing to do with me anymore.""

Vincent's gaze darkened as he stared at the pale woman resting on the hospital bed.

The room fell quiet, the only sound was the soft drip from the IV line.

""Good.""

He suddenly smirked, pulled out a black card from his pocket, and tossed it onto the bed.

""Since you're being so reasonable, take this three million as your medical compensation.

""Don't forget your role—when Juliana needs you, you'd better show up right away.""

After dropping the card, Vincent stormed out, slamming the door behind him without turning around.

Alice opened her mouth to speak but ended up saying nothing, quietly watching the door close.

Over the course of her two-day stay in the hospital, the IV was replaced 12 times, and the nurse came in 23 times, but he never showed up once.

Her phone screen lit up, displaying the latest 3x3 photo grid posted by Juliana.

Vincent was tying a silk scarf around her neck on a yacht. The ocean breeze rustled his sleeve, revealing the watch he always wore—the same one Alice had bought him with her very first paycheck.

Another photo showed the two of them toasting in a Michelin three-star restaurant, red wine reflecting the rare smile on his face.

The last photo was a close-up of Juliana wearing a shiny diamond ring, with a caption underneath, ""He said he wants to give me the most unforgettable wedding ever.""

All of a sudden, a memory hit Alice—one from a snowy night in her previous life.

She had been waiting outside his office building, holding a container of chicken soup she'd carefully cooked for hours. But through the glass window, she watched as he sat beside Juliana, gently feeding her soup spoon by spoon.

When the security guard came to make her leave, the hot soup spilled onto her hand, causing blisters that stayed for days.

And on what should've been their wedding anniversary, the starlit room she had secretly decorated was completely ruined.

That night, Vincent held a drunken, sobbing Juliana in his arms and yelled at Alice, ""Get out! Who do you think you are?""

The cold medicine flowed through the IV and into her veins.

Alice slowly removed the needle and wrote her name on the discharge form.

Outside, the spring weather was perfect.

And at last, she understood that some people will always stay cold inside, no matter what you do.

**Chapter 6**

After being discharged from the hospital, Alice thought about when she might visit again after going overseas, so she arranged a small gathering with some close friends.

In a private room at a private restaurant, her friends raised their glasses to toast her farewell.

During the cheers and laughter, someone mentioned Vincent, but Alice simply smiled and steered the conversation elsewhere.

""Try this seafood mousseline. It's the chef's signature dish,"" she said.

By the time the gathering ended, it was nearly midnight.

She went back to the private room to get the bag she had left behind, but then she heard loud, mocking laughter coming from behind the soundproof door in the hallway.

""Who's Alice, anyway? She chased after Vincent and played blood bank for seven years—only to end up handing him over to Juliana on a silver platter.""

Peeking through the door, Alice saw Juliana lounging on a leather sofa, casually spinning a diamond engagement ring with her fingers.

""When I asked her to record that video, did you see her face? She looked like she had just eaten something disgusting.""

Alice's phone quietly buzzed in her hand.

She quickly turned off the sound, switched to record mode, and aimed the camera straight at the group celebrating inside.

""I heard the last surgery used her blood?""

A girl with blonde hair stepped up to Juliana and asked, ""How did you pull that off?""

Juliana smirked, her lips curled in amusement.

""She only agreed to donate after Vincent told her he would marry her.""

She gently swirled the wine glass in her hand, and the dark red wine inside looked just like thick blood.

""But now... what if I just happen to cut my finger by mistake...""

Suddenly, she crushed the lemon wedge that decorated the rim of the glass.

""That fool will have to be my personal blood bank wherever I go.""

The broken glass cut into her skin, and fresh blood slowly appeared on her fingertips.

As everyone around gasped in shock, she smiled and calmly licked the blood away.

""Why panic? With Alice around, I'll never run out of blood.""

The hallway lights cast shadows over her lashes, hiding the storm of emotions behind her eyes.

""Honestly, Juliana's trick is genius!"" someone said.

Then came loud, nasty laughter from the private room. ""Want to deal with Alice? All Juliana has to do is fake a faint, and Vincent will drain her dry without thinking twice!""

Alice felt her whole body turn cold.

So that's what those so-called ""accidents"" were in her previous life.

Juliana's skiing injury, the staged robbery, and even the last car crash weren't accidents at all—they were part of a scheme to kill her on purpose.

Alice clenched her teeth hard, a sharp, metallic taste filling her mouth as she fought back the urge to charge in and rip apart that smug face.

Suddenly, a loud ringtone cut through the noise.

Juliana peeked at her phone screen, and her face shifted quickly. ""I need to take this call.""

Alice moved fast, slipping behind the wall out of sight.

Looking through the blurry glass panel, she noticed Juliana's heels tapping nervously on the marble floor.

""Matheo Reagan, how many times do I have to say it? Don't call me again!""

Juliana said that while heading toward the quiet fire escape.

Driven by curiosity, Alice followed quietly behind.

In the faint light, she saw a man in a bomber jacket gripping Juliana's wrist tightly.

""So, 20 years of growing up together means nothing compared to the Seibert family's wealth?"" the man asked.

""Let me go!"" she shouted.

Juliana shoved him away hard. ""And what have you ever given me? I even covered your mom's surgery!""

The man laughed coldly, his smile full of mockery.

""Then who was the one in my bed last night, saying she couldn't forget me?""

He pulled out his phone and opened the photo gallery. He said, ""Should I remind Mr. Seibert where you really were on the night he proposed?""

On the screen was a photo showing a large hotel bed, and Juliana's naked body was clearly in view.

""Are you out of your mind?!""

She lunged forward to snatch the phone, her fingernails scraping his face and leaving red lines.

Hiding nearby, Alice froze in shock after hearing what had just happened, and the phone slipped out of her shaking hand.

With a loud thud, the phone that was still recording hit the floor.

**Chapter 7**

""Stop right there!"" Juliana's loud voice sliced through the air like a blade.

Alice flinched and quickly stuffed the phone from the floor into her pocket.

She hurried back to the private room, holding her chest where her heart thudded wildly, trying to steady her breath. After saving the video, she checked the time, grabbed her bag, and turned to leave.

But before she could step out, a group of three or four girls stormed over and grabbed her, twisting her arms behind her.

""Search her."" Juliana's voice came out cold and cruel.

Hands roamed over Alice's body, and her things were scattered all over the floor.

Just as someone was about to grab her phone, Alice suddenly drove her knee upward and slammed it into the girl's lower stomach.

""You crazy woman!""

Juliana saw it happen and instantly slapped her across the face.

Alice tasted blood in her mouth but smiled anyway.

That smile only pushed Juliana over the edge.

After giving her friends a quick look, Alice was pressed down on the coffee table by the girls.

Cold liquor soaked through her blouse, clinging to her skin like ice. She could hear Juliana talking on the phone with Vincent.

""Vincent, Ms. Caylor seems to be injured...""

About 15 minutes later, someone kicked the private room door open from the outside.

Vincent stood at the entrance, the light behind him casting shadows as his gaze landed on the chaos.

Juliana calmly wiped her fingers with a tissue, cleaning off blood, while her so-called ""best friends"" yanked Alice's hair and pinned her down on the coffee table.

""What happened here?"" Vincent's tone was low and intimidating.

""Ms. Caylor just barged in and attacked me...""

Juliana fell into his arms, showing off the red marks on her arm that she had secretly pinched herself. ""Luckily, my friends kept me safe...""

Through her blurry, blood-covered vision, Alice saw Vincent's shoes stop in front of her.

She struggled to lift her head. ""I didn't..."" she murmured, and as she spoke, blood trickled out from the corners of her lips.

She tried to speak up for herself, but Vincent cut her off.

""Shut up! Who told you to talk back?""

At his words, the bodyguard stepped up and forced her down.

A hard slap hit her face, the loud smack echoing through the room.

The first hit twisted her face sideways.

The second made her ears ring painfully.

The third blow made everything go dark for a moment.

Blood spilled from her nose and mouth, soaking into her clothes.

She crumpled to the floor, weak and dizzy. Through her fading vision, she saw Vincent standing nearby with Juliana in his arms.

He stared down at her with arrogance. ""I hope you don't forget what happened today.

""If you ever lay a hand on Juliana again, I'll make sure you suffer more than you could imagine.""

With that, he walked away with Juliana, never once glancing back, leaving Alice all alone in a pool of blood.

She struggled to move her fingers as tears, mingled with blood, dripped onto the floor.

The sting on her face was nothing compared to the ache in her heart.

So in his eyes, she wasn't even worth an explanation.",2,1753278459.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,2,1.0,False

I have been working at this particular shop for almost 2 months now and before she arrived I’ve had no complaints have never been asked for a drink remake, i have been cleaning the lobby regularly and I had sat on a bar stool behind the coffee bar which is NOT of health code violation. These are the reasons that I was fired for, my theory is that they fired me for my gender expression (I am a trans masculine person and this is a wealthier white area) and that I have pointed out a few problem areas that they have in the shop (things are broken) and they claim they don’t have the money to fix those problems. I will be taking this to the department of labor to get unemployment benefits and also have requested a letter of unemployment as well. I am currently in medical and school debt as well as I have bills to pay, so yes I am going to claim unemployment. I just want some advice or maybe even something to help my case, unfortunately I live in an at will state (Ga) that’s the most I’m giving location wise lol.

1m79lin,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m79lin/what_makes_the_shardor_kc101_coffee_maker_stand/,What makes the SHARDOR KC101 Coffee Maker stand out? A detailed review,"I recently got my hands on the SHARDOR KC101 Single Serve Coffee Maker, and I’ve used it consistently over the past couple of weeks. It’s been an interesting ride discovering its quirks and strengths, brewing countless cups of coffee for myself, my family, and the occasional visiting friend. While I’ll say upfront that this machine is a decent performer overall, there are some aspects about it that might make you take a second look.

**Stylish Design and Compact Build**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this coffee maker was its matte black finish and compact build. It has a sleek, modern aesthetic with dimensions of 10"" x 6.3"" x 11"". That means it fits snugly in my rather cramped kitchen countertop without taking up too much space. The stainless steel accents and well-organized control panel elevate the design even more. I even tested it in my workspace, and it blended in well both visually and practically. While the design is a win for me, I did notice that some reviews mentioned light fingerprint smudges on the matte surface, so cleaning might require a bit more effort to keep it looking pristine.

**Performance and Brewing Capability**  
What sets this coffee maker apart is its dual brewing options—hot coffee and iced coffee. Not only does it handle both well, but the extra strength “Bold Brew” option is fantastic for kicking up the flavor and intensity. As someone who occasionally enjoys experimenting with coffee profiles, especially during groggy mornings, I found this feature to be a game-changer. The machine supports both K Cup pods and ground coffee thanks to its detachable capsule holder and reusable grind filter, meaning it caters to a wide variety of preferences. Having the option to switch between pods and ground coffee is especially handy for me since I like to use my favorite local beans.  

[Check SHARDOR KC101 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ddpcf1yq/)

**Versatility in Brew Sizes**  
The ability to brew 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 ounces of coffee? Yes, please. Whether I wanted a quick 6-ounce pick-me-up on a rushed weekday morning or needed to brew a larger cup to fill my travel mug, this machine delivered. I tested all the sizes extensively, from a teeny tiny pour to the full 14 ounces for those marathon office days. Its speed impressed me too. The machine starts brewing within seconds, which is perfect when you're in a hurry—but that wouldn’t matter much if you absolutely have to wait for it to reheat between cups for back-to-back servings, which I found mildly annoying.

**Water Tank Capacity and Convenience**  
A standout feature for me is the removable 50-ounce water tank. It’s large enough to brew multiple cups without needing a refill constantly—thank goodness, because I can’t be bothered to refill every other cup of coffee. The transparent tank makes it easy to keep an eye on water levels. It’s also super easy to clean. However, my mom pointed out that the 50-ounce tank might still feel small if you’re hosting a gathering, in which case you’d find yourself refilling sooner than you’d want.

**Durability and Portability**  
This machine feels durable and well-designed to withstand frequent use. The removable drip tray, which accommodates travel mugs up to 6.3 inches, is great for taking coffee on the go. I’ve dropped my travel mug into it several times, and it didn’t feel overly cramped or precarious. Its portability meaningfully extends to its lightweight nature, as I moved it from my main kitchen to the patio during weekend brunches with friends. At just 5.17 pounds, I wasn’t huffing and puffing trying to transport it.

**Perks**  
- Dual brewing possibilities (hot and iced coffee) with a bold brew setting  
- Compatible with both K Cup pods and ground coffee  
- Sleek and space-efficient design perfect for small kitchens  
- Fast brewing time, which saves those rushed mornings  
- Adapter-friendly travel mug space and lightweight build  

**Flaws**  
- Matte black design prone to smudging, requiring frequent cleaning  
- Only 50-ounce water reservoir might seem limited when brewing for groups  
- Needs reheating if brewing multiple cups of coffee sequentially  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing this to some competitors like the Keurig K-Classic and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, there are clear distinctions. While the SHARDOR KC101 wins in style and portability, the Keurig edges ahead slightly in overall brewing speed and pod variety. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, on the other hand, has a similar dual-use design but sacrifices aesthetics for bulkiness. I appreciated the SHARDOR’s removable stainless steel drip tray which accommodates travel mugs—a feature some other machines fail to match comfortably. However, competitors like Keurig still dominate when it comes to sheer brand reputation and market penetration.

**Value for Money**  
This machine hovers at a price point that feels fair for its features and performance. It offers a lot of flexibility, from brewing sizes to coffee type, but it’s not the machine to buy if you’re expecting ultra-premium finishes or assembly. It’s a great mid-tier option, balancing affordability and functionality. Long story short: it’s a “bang for the buck” option if you want a solid performer without breaking the bank.

Then when their is nothing to do she finds dumb pointless irrelvent stuff. Like wiping an obscure spot that you can barely see. Checking the coffee every 5 minutes even though everything is stocked.

1m79iro,https://i.redd.it/3cfaltuanmef1.png,UCC coffee plus sugar trap for Japanese kids:  Masked as harmless innovation,"*""****Yes****, under the Bridge360 Metatheory Model, UCC’s strategy of exposing children to sweetened coffee-flavored products* ***qualifies as an inroad to sugar addiction****.""*

The following are the prompts issued pertinent to the topic.

* UCC now has launched a program exposing kids to coffee combined with sugar, e.g., coffee candy?
* Using Bridge360 Metatheory Model, assess if this is an inroad to sugar addiction in the long-term.

The following have been the responses involved.

LLM1 response:

Yes — UCC and other coffee companies in Japan have indeed been introducing coffee-flavored candies and kid-friendly coffee treats as part of a long-term strategy to cultivate future coffee drinkers.

# ☕ 1. UCC’s Coffee Candy

* UCC launched **“UHA UCC Milk Coffee Candy”**, a hard candy styled to echo their classic canned UCC Coffee. It features:
   * Packaging mirroring their iconic milk coffee cans
   * A sweet, milky coffee flavor that appeals to younger palates ([twatanabe.faculty.wesleyan.edu](https://twatanabe.faculty.wesleyan.edu/japanese-snacks-a-tasting-and-reflections-on-their-cultural-implications-by-sophie-scobell-and-emily-young-2021/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* As noted in a 2021 tasting review:“The candy lasts quite a while … It reminds me of the extremely oversweetened coffees you can get in a bottle like the Starbucks Frappuccino ones.” ([twatanabe.faculty.wesleyan.edu](https://twatanabe.faculty.wesleyan.edu/japanese-snacks-a-tasting-and-reflections-on-their-cultural-implications-by-sophie-scobell-and-emily-young-2021/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# 2. Broader Beverage Strategy: Planting the Flavor Early

* It’s more than a novelty — it’s marketing by design. Nestlé Japan, for one, used coffee-flavored sweets and even cartoons in the late 1960s to foster early affinity, embedding coffee taste memories in kids before they could drink the real thing ([Geinokai / Big In Japan](https://geinokai.jp/blog/2025/06/02/coffee-in-japan-nestle-candy-first/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* Though UCC pioneered canned coffee in 1969, other beverage giants quickly adopted the same tactic of appealing to youth with sweet, coffee-flavored confections ([Geinokai / Big In Japan](https://geinokai.jp/blog/2025/06/02/coffee-in-japan-nestle-candy-first/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

# 3. Why Feed Kids Coffee-Flavored Candy?

* **Taste Familiarity**: Early exposure to sweet coffee flavors builds taste memories and reduces bitterness barriers later.
* **Brand Loyalty**: Kids enjoying coffee-flavored candy may associate that flavor with a brand, sticking with it as they grow older.
* **Market Development**: In Japan, where tea was traditionally dominant, this method helped cultivate a generation comfortable with coffee — eventually fueling demand for real coffee beverages.

# ✅ So, in short:

* **Yes**, UCC has been rolling out coffee-centric candy targeted at children (e.g. UHA UCC Milk Coffee Candy).
* This is part of a well-established industry playbook: introduce sweet, coffee-infused products to kids, building brand recognition and taste preference early — a tactic dating at least back to the late 1960s in Japan.

LLM1 response:

Using the **Bridge360 Metatheory Model**, which evaluates systems through the lens of entropy attractors, volatility-fragility dynamics, perturbation pathways, and long-term convergence or divergence trajectories, we can assess the strategy of exposing children to coffee-flavored sugar products (e.g., UCC Milk Coffee Candy) as a potential inroad to **sugar addiction** with broad societal implications.

# ⚙️ I. Systemic Perturbation and Entropic Morphism

**Premise**: Introducing sugar-laden coffee-flavored products to children is not a neutral act — it constitutes a **targeted perturbation** in their early cognitive-taste reward systems.

* **Perturbation Node**: Children's gustatory systems and neurochemical reward circuits
* **Entropic Morphism**: Repeated exposure to sugar + caffeine-flavored stimuli shapes neurochemical expectations — encoding these flavors as *comfort attractors*.
* **Scaling Risk**: What begins as benign ""candy"" becomes a morphing pathway toward **habitual sugar intake** → **early preference for high-sugar drinks** → **gateway to daily high-sugar coffee drinks** as adults.

➡ **Assessment**: This is an engineered entropic attractor redirecting a low-entropy biological system (the child’s stable nutritional baseline) toward a **higher-entropy dietary landscape** (sugar-dependent metabolism, fragmented energy cycles, circadian instability).

# 🧠 II. Volatility Paradox Manifestation

The Volatility Paradox in the Bridge360 model describes how systems that appear stable and pleasurable short-term (e.g., sweetened coffee candy) **increase long-term systemic volatility** (e.g., metabolic disorder, dependency, public health costs).

* **Short-term Attractor**: Sweetened comfort, brand loyalty, mimicry of adult behavior
* **Long-term Fragility**: Reduced capacity for dietary self-regulation, long-term insulin sensitivity erosion, chronic disease risk
* **Public Systems Fragility**: Increases burden on national health insurance systems, education policy (diet and behavior), and consumer regulation

➡ **Assessment**: This strategy leverages short-term memetic appeal to plant **fragile attractors** that generate long-run public health volatility — a textbook Volatility Paradox as per Bridge360 norms.

# 🧬 III. Entropy-Driven Altruism (EDA) Test

Entropy-Driven Altruism, as a governance and ethical principle within the Bridge360 framework, evaluates whether an initiative:

1. Reduces systemic entropy long-term,
2. Enhances cooperative stability, and
3. Promotes sustainable feedback loops.

* **UCC’s Strategy**: Prioritizes long-term consumer conditioning over metabolic well-being.
* **Fails EDA**: While profitable, it **externalizes entropy** into public health, parental stress, and future healthcare systems.
* **Mimics Tobacco Trajectory**: “Introduce early → addict → normalize → profit → crisis → regulation”

➡ **Assessment**: UCC’s introduction of coffee + sugar flavor combinations to children **fails the EDA principle** and is better classified as an **entropy-externalizing economic attractor**, not a sustainable one.

# 🧠 IV. Memetic Feedback Loops

The meme of “coffee candy = safe, fun, adult-like” is reinforced via:

* Anime branding
* Cute packaging
* Vending machine ubiquity
* Parental permissiveness in a high-stress society

These memetic elements embed themselves into early symbolic learning. Children absorb the **narrative of coffee-sugar = reward**, hardwiring this into long-term consumption behavior.

➡ **Assessment**: The memetic scaffolding here contributes to **multi-level convergence toward sugar dependency attractors**, which reduces the diversity of healthy alternatives over time — increasing entropy.

# 🧾 Final Assessment (Bridge360 Summary):

|**Dimension**|**Assessment**|
|:-|:-|
|Entropic Morphism|Creates high-entropy behavioral pathways via early exposure|
|Volatility-Paradox Profile|High — Appears stable (sweet treats) but seeds long-term fragility|
|EDA Compliance|**Fails** — System increases entropy, fails cooperative altruism threshold|
|Memetic Resilience|Strong — Reinforced through cultural symbols, but in service of harmful attractor|
|Convergence Trajectory|Toward sugar-and-caffeine dependent consumer patterns|

# ✅ Conclusion:

**Yes**, under the Bridge360 Metatheory Model, UCC’s strategy of exposing children to sweetened coffee-flavored products **qualifies as an inroad to sugar addiction**. It is a **fragile attractor**, masked as harmless innovation, yet functionally increasing entropy within biological, cultural, and governance systems. A responsible shift would require a pivot toward **low-entropy, EDA-aligned beverage ecosystems** — e.g., unsweetened alternatives, delayed exposure, and education-centered marketing.

It was a hot, humid 2-week journey with occasional rain. We had to use AC 24/7 almost, but managed to deal with hot summer air alright. We spent about 800€/person on food, transport (including shinkanzens), souvenirs, data plan (eSim - Saily, 45€/2 weeks for the whole group)

Our main goals where - nature, small shopping for souvenirs, sightseeing and colorful food experience.

I can definitely say, I wanna visit Japan again...probably Hokkaido, because I felt a bit anxious in these big cities when I first came in.

We haven't used SUICA/TOICA card, due to unpredictable conditions and travel plans, where we were quite flexible and also short-time of stay. We were okey with coins, we didn't wait almost nowhere in line. We also haven't used JR passes due to cost-effectives of single pre-booked routes 2 weeks in advance.

2nd of July - flight from Vienna to Helsinki to Nagoya

3rd of July - evening landing in rainy Nagoya + immigration + realising how to use trains and navigating train stations to reach Nagoya station + hotel in Nagoya to stay the night over (just in case we would be really delayed we didn't want to risk chasing last shinkanzens) + withdrawing cash + small dinner from 7/11

4th of July - smooth shinknazen to Shin-Osaka + public transport into Airbnb in Bentencho (cheap, but quite noisy street as there was a highway and subway line in front and on the back of the street) + small food and water shopping for the evening + Minoh Park and waterfall in the evening (insane light show aimed at the waterfall, calm, almost empty path leading to the waterfall, along the path were lots of public toilets and insane amount of vending machines with water) + Ichiran noodles (it's amazing how smooth and introvertly they deal with customers, awesome experience)

5th of July - Osaka castle (buses streamlining road for ""lazy"" tourists, really a lot of people, karate practice in the historic barracks, we didn't even attempt to stand in the line into Osaka Castle's museum, a cheap price of souvenirs sold next to the castle) + Shinsekai district (felt like almost any other street IMO, but we did visit Pringles and Pomaibo shop) + MEGA Don Quijote next to Shinsekai + Vietnamese restaurant (Pho bo soup)

6th of July - Kyoto daytrip - Arashiyama Bamboo forest (quite crowded, but after completing the forest, crowds disappeared and we explored a nearby hill heading towards Mt.Ogura observatory, interesting railway cutting through the bamboo forest, annoying rikshas....like, you had to make a way to taxis and then to rikshas...) + Fushimi Inari temple (lots of people, the higher we went, the less people and calm atmosphere + walk through Gion (we have seen 2 geishas in the distance, otherwise nice historic district/street) + Yasaka shrine + Korean BBQ near Bentencho (quite pricey, but solid experience, at around 3900JPY/person without sidedishes/drinks)

7th of July - Cool-off day + waiting for baggage which....was stuck in Helsinki due to Aviation Union strike

8th of July - Nara daytrip - quick stop at Kyoto pokecentre + quick pass-by Todai-Ji+ Deer park (200JPY/pack of crackers - we fed them, they followed, they bowed - everything as seen in videos) + walk-up to Wakakusayama Rest Area + Wakakusayama hill (1 hour walking, but with breath-taking views)

9th of July - moving by shinkanzen to Tokyo + pokecentre near Nipponbashi + routing into Okubo into our Airbnb (quiet alleyway few minutes from main Okubo street) + Shogun Burger (solid burgers)

10th of July - daytrip to Gotemba with Romancecar (with the only day where conditions to see Mt.Fuji were the best...still didn't see much of it, well...it's summer, we knew the view wouldn't be the best, yet wanted to take the journey) + Heiwa Peace park (nice garden, few buddhist temple and massive in the ""main square"" with lions around it) + late-afternoon walk-through Shibuya Scramble Crossing + Yoyogi park + Meiji-Jingu (a bit overrated in my opinion, as we have a seen a bit more shrines in Kyoto) + Shinjuku to our Airbnb

11th of July - Tokyo Tower (the ""lower"" observation deck at about 100 meters is just fine for observation and also it costs just about 10€ to go up the elevator) + shopping (Kappabashi kitchen street, A-PIT Autocabs, Don Quijote in Shinjuku) + Sushi dinner at

12th of July - shopping (Akihabara, one more stop at Kappabashi) + Steak dinner at Steakhouse 91 (small, little resturant for 10 people at the time - great experience with colorful plate of vegetable and bamboo sprouts)

13th of July - daytrip to Kamakura (Kamakurakoko-mae train station, stroll towards Enoshima Island and it's cliffy side on the north side + watching local folklore festival going-on through the entire city of Enoshima and Koshigoe + walk through Koshigoe where train runs paralel the street + lazy swimming on the hot beach near Kamakurakoko-mae - where there were no changing places...but we managed to change in privacy) + another Ichiran

14th of July - lazy day, washing clothes in airbnb, small souvenir hunting, expecting a typhoon to hit farther parts of Chiba and Tokyo...so we waited just in-case + another sushi restaurant

15th of July - lazy day, last shopping, drying clothes + semi-rainy day

16 of July - Shinkanzen to Nagoya - locking suitcases in the station (we had to search for a while for lockers that took coins and banknotes..as they did have more SUICA/TOICA ones) + small half-a-daytrip to Gifu city (inspired by watching anime How to become ordinary) - Chusetsu Bridge (just to take a photo) + Inaba shrine (nice, peaceful and empty shrine and Torii gates) + 40 minute walk-up to Suidoyama Observation Deck + a stop-by at the Takuro Coffee (where strangely, DJ plays house/jazz/reggae during coffee) to eat a cheesecake and sip a bit of cappucino before leaving + return to Nagoya + feast at McDonalds before depature + buying tickets to airport train + departure close to midnight",1,1753277840.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

1m79g92,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1m79g92/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_dezin_8856_and/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle DEZIN 8856 and Is It Worth It,"The DEZIN 8856 electric kettle quickly became a staple in my kitchen, blending its sleek design with well-rounded functionality. I wasn’t expecting much more than a reliable water heater when I got my hands on it, but after using it daily, I realized there’s a lot going on with this kettle. With its matte black finish, compact design, and attention to detail, it looks fantastic on the counter. It doesn’t just sit there looking pretty either—this thing is packed with features you’d want in an electric kettle, and some you probably didn’t realize you needed.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This kettle delivers in both form and function. The black-painted stainless steel gives off a modern vibe, and at just 8.7” x 7.5” x 9.8” in size, it fits snugly on my counter without hogging space. The dual-wall construction is a standout. Unlike the burning-hot surfaces I’ve accidentally grazed with other kettles, this one stays cool to the touch. My accident-prone fingers appreciate that, but I’m especially relieved knowing my kids won’t hurt themselves either. The lid and spout feel sturdy, and the large opening makes cleaning less of a chore—no more struggling to reach the bottom with an awkward sponge.  

**Ease of Use Features**  
The variety of settings left me pleasantly surprised. With 9 preset temperatures adjustable in 10°F increments, there’s a preset for almost every hot beverage I could think of—green tea, coffee, milk, you name it. It’s incredibly user-friendly: just hit the “SET TEMP” button, and the LED screen displays the selected temperature, counting up until it’s reached. It heats 1.7 liters in about five to seven minutes, which feels like no time at all for my caffeine-deprived mornings. 

[Check DEZIN 8856 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0d9gdx83l/)  

**Performance and Speed**  
This kettle doesn’t mess around when it comes to heating speed. The 1200W powerful heating element does its job efficiently, boiling water without wasting precious time. And unlike my old kettle, there’s no annoying noise while it’s in use—it’s surprisingly quiet. I did have to get used to its memory feature, though. After boiling, it keeps the water at the previously used temperature for up to 12 hours. It’s great for tea enthusiasts like me—no need to reheat your water over and over. But I’ll admit, I once walked away forgetting the ""keep warm"" mode was on, only to find mildly hot water hours later. A user error, yes, but something to remember for anyone prone to running on autopilot.  

**Pros**  
- The cool-to-the-touch exterior adds an extra layer of safety. 
- Adjustable temperature control, perfect for teas, coffee, and even baby formulas.  
- Memory function and 12-hour keep-warm mode for convenience.  
- Stainless steel interior keeps the water tasting clean without any plastic contact.  

**Cons**  
- The memory function could be confusing for people who want fresh-hot water every single time.  
- Exterior paint, while beautiful, can show smudges and fingerprints easily.  
- Some users might prefer a slightly faster boiling time for smaller amounts of water.

**Safety and Health Aspects**  
Safety seems to be at the forefront of the design. The automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection have saved me more than once since I tend to start the kettle and then forget about it. With BPA-free stainless steel on the inside, I’m reassured that the water isn’t collecting any harmful chemicals. 

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other kettles I’ve tried, the DEZIN 8856 holds up incredibly well against brands like Cuisinart and Breville that are known for their electric kettles. Those often lean premium but may lack some of the thoughtful features this kettle includes, such as its memory function or specific temperature settings at this price point. However, Breville kettles can have a sturdier handle design, which may appeal to someone who wants a bit more heft. With DEZIN, you’re banking on a modern, lightweight design rather than heavy-duty hardware. That said, it covers most people’s needs without any trade-offs in reliability.

**Quality for Price**  
When comparing features to cost, this kettle delivers smart spending value. For an item that ticks so many boxes—style, functionality, and thoughtful design—it feels like a solid investment. More premium brands charge nearly double for similar features, so in that sense, this kettle punches above its price bracket. The only minor quibble is with the paint-job maintenance because, as mentioned earlier, the exterior coating does attract smudges. But that hardly feels like a deal-breaker.

He squinted at me with both eyes.  “You … *are* normal, right?”

My gaze dropped to the stampede-resistant ground.  I let my thoughts drift back to *those days*.

*^(“Caleb?  What’s that look on your face?)*  ***^(You better not be having some mantastic flashback and refusing to elaborate!”)***

At the edge of my consciousness, I was vaguely aware that Lmur was [spazzing out in his attempt to recapture my attention.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxGcCLajFtf1cZk9a9YzF483dCIJRDBwr6?si=2vg7WjNurs6_Zoml)  A lost cause.  My mind was in another time, another place.

The Arxur warden snatched up a Venlil pup, visibly pleased with her choice.  The pup seemed petrified beyond his capacity to struggle.

I sighed and eased to my feet.  “Hey lady.  That’s mine.”

The cattle prisoners scampered out of the way as I strode towards the Arxur.  Her translucent, third eyelid blinked at me a couple times.  She seemed confused, then amused.

“Wait your turn, Human,” she commanded.  “You’ll be following him soon enough.”

I clenched my fists.

She hissed humorously.  *“Ha!*  What will you even do?  I’ve heard of you Human men.  You’re barely even men at all.  You’re *‘gentlemen’*.  By some sense of twisted honour, you can’t even hit a lady.”

I squinted at her, looked her up and down.  “A lady?  Hmm … guess I was wrong.”

“What are you-?  ***ARRGGH!”***

She crumpled, clutching her abdomen as my fist withdrew.

“Wh-what was ***that!?”*** she wheezed.

“Your liver,” I explained.  “It’s weird that you have one, but you do.”

“B-but ...” she clucked.  “You Human males c-can’t …”

“See, problem is I ain’t lookin’ at a lady,” I delineated.  “And *you* ain’t looking at a gentleman.”

My kick sent her head whipping back.

\---

A pair of Arxur wrestled in the pit, marring their scarred skin with claws thirsty for blood.  Spectators roared, cheered and jeered.

The battle stilled.

All eyes turned upon me as I dragged the warden’s body into the pit.  Thankfully, she wasn’t very big for an Arxur.  6’7, tops.  As of now, I had bigger game in my sights.

Flopping her into the centre of the pit, I clashed glares with the spectators.

**“Fellow predators, I am** ***disappointed!”*** I boomed.

Sneers and snarls came my way.

**“No fangs, no claws, scales, yet I crushed one of your own.  With.**  ***Ease,”*** I scoffed.

**“She was WEAK!” s**narled an onlooker.

**“I’ll show you a** ***real*** **predator!” R**oared another.

**“Tough talk from walking** ***MEAT!”***

**“Then I challenge you!”** I bellowed.  **“No weapons!  No armor, no help!  Hand to claw, one on one every three suns!  For as long as I win, all the prey are** ***mine!***  **Surely, you fear no loss to a weak, hairless ape!”**

**“I’LL GUT YOU MYSELF!”** screeched a particularly passionate spectator.

Cries of agreement chorused from the audience.

**“Weak talk!  I won’t believe you until my entrails are hanging from your claws!”** I snarled back.  **“We shall see who the** ***real predators*** **are!”**

Roaring declarations of battle rocked the pit.

A shadow fell over me. 

“Your silly little game starts and ends with me,” came a condescending hiss.

I turned to find one of the Arxur fighters looming over me.  One of his eyes had sealed shut after what his dance partner had done to him.

I pointed at my corresponding eye and grinned.  “You sure you’re up to it, shiner?”

He throbbed a laugh.  “We will not delay, little meat man.  This night, I shall paint The Pit with your innards!”

With a scoff, I beckoned him.

He came at me.

I slipped under his swipe, into his blindside, and clocked him in the liver.  If it ain’t broke, break it, but this guy was pretty tough.

So, I clocked him again.

***“HHHHHHRAAAAAA!”*** roared the grizzled, muscled Arxur before me.

Oh … that breath was … really something.

**“I am Granorr, fang of the prophet!  Wrath of the wet and drippy claws!  Drinker of tears who bathes in them too!  Squeezer of squeaks from the nostrils of the weak!”**

Don’t laugh.  Don’t laugh.  Don’t laugh.

**“I was told I’d be fighting a** ***PREDATOR,*** **but all I see is a-!”**

“Can I say something, Granny?” I asked.

He blinked down at me, thrown off by the interjection.

“If I had three words to describe your breath, they would be stink, stank and stunk.”

Yep.  He totally lost it.  It’s really hard to coordinate your moves when you lose it.  Just ask the squealing Arxur with my knuckle in his eye!

He collapsed, paws over his afflicted sockets.

“Wh-what manner of predator-?” he croaked.

My kick found his throat.  Down he went, back smacking to the ground.

“Yes.  *Predator …”* I stated.  “Don’t *ever* forget that.”

Hesitant at first, chuffing cheers arose from the audience.

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 15th, 2136*

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

I dove clear.  *Barely.*  My opponent slammed into the side of the pit as he barreled after me on all fours.  This guy was relentless.  He wouldn’t let me breathe.

“I’ve been *watching* you, Human,” he sneered, rearing up to bear down on me.  “Your tricks, your thought process, your smart mouth, I’ve seen it all.”

I threw myself to the side and his claws raked the border in my stead.  It was an ugly sound.

My kick blazed to his head.  He caught it.  *Effortlessly.*  He began to squeeze and I heard the joints popping.

**“No more tricks!”** he roared, flinging my foot away.

I reeled.  Dove.  Rolled as his pounce slammed down in my place.  I was springing to my feet when his tail hooked me in passing.  Swept me up and slammed me down.

My hEad SpUnn.  He plAnted a heaVy paw on my chest.  My ribs screamed.

He sniffed at the skin his claws punctured in my torso.  Sneered and snorted with disgust.

“So soft.  So squishy,” he spat.  “Such skills don’t belong in weak claws.  I’ll *crush* them out of you.  You’ll watch as I raise a new generation of Arxur fighters.  You’ll watch as we devour our Human cattle before you.  Then, you *die.”*

“Of … what?  Old age?” I gasped.  “That’s kind of-“

I fired a kick between his legs with everything I had.

He shuddered, but didn’t shift.  **“HA!**  Is that all you- ***hrmff!?""***

My hand shot into his mouth and I yanked his tongue.  Couldn’t rip it off, but you know what?  Close enough.

He recoiled, fumbling at his maw.  I helped him off me with a sharp kick.

I’d scarcely got my feet under me before he lashed out with a vengeance.  Unlike the others, he’d taken heavy damage and he was *still* coordinated.  A slash clipped stray strands of my hair.  Another shredded my sleeve.  The third found my flesh.  He *thought* he was winning.  Thought this was a done deal, so he got sloppy.

I got in close.

Liver kick.

He drew back.

I closed the distance again.  Neck strike.  Knuckle to eye.  Liver blow.  *Liver blow.*  ***Liver blow.***

His breaths grew ragged.  He was tiring.

None of the Arxur had lasted this long.  They didn’t have the chance to test the formidable stamina of a Human.

He powered through my blows and lunged, jaws first.  His limp tongue was hanging out.  My palm shot up into his chin, slamming his jaws shut.

***KLUNNCH!***

The crowd went silent.  I imagined all eyes were following the fleshy thing as it splatted to the ground, but my focus was on wrapping this up.

The Arxur was still wailing when my palms clapped into his eardrums.

My world was pain.

Ears rang.  Tears bleared my eyes.  There was a strange sense of disassociation.  I was an observer, rapt with cold, silent wonder and horror.  I heard myself crying, felt the pain rain into me like the stone storms of my home world, but I wasn’t paying mind to any of that.

[I was watching](https://youtu.be/kkcq3tX2nOA?si=vx3vcZhSz2CIRgIM&t=159) *him.*

My flailing slashes tasted nothing but air, yet his blazing blows found my weak points without fail.

What manner of man …?

**POW!  BRAX!  THUM!**

What breed of beast …?

**THNK!  PAM!  PAX!**

What ***monster?***

***Why wouldn’t he finish me in one stroke!?***

… Oh …

He *couldn’t.* 

I was stubborn.  I wasn’t making it easy, and he had no claws or teeth to end the fight in one stroke.  Instead, his blunt blows took me bit by bit, bite by bite.  How could this-?

… Ah …

… Now, I understood.  His claws and fangs were not bare for all to see, yet we’d seen them all the same.  We’d been too dim to realize: his mind was his teeth.  His skills were his fangs.

Even as my senseless body wept and roared and flailed, my conscious mind watched his silhouette, smeared and twisted through the tears.  How remarkable.  His dance was a thing of beauty.  An *Art.*  We Arxur had nothing like this.  Art was for prey.  Beauty was for weak of mind, but this was the single most predatory thing I’d ever seen.  And it was *beautiful.*  We’d misjudged the humans.  They were *monsters.*

And so, I watched as My Predator danced my defea-

He went down.  I almost chased him to the ground.  It took me a moment to realize that it was over.  This guy didn’t drop easily.

Why was the crowd so quiet?

I strode back to the entry point, shooting them quizzical glares.  Not-Lady and Lann were waiting there.   The pup barreled into my legs in a hyperactive hug.  He’d come a long way from the petrified little Venlil I’d saved from her jaws.

**“Ohstars!Thatwassocool!Youjustkepthittingandhittingandhistongueflewoffandand-!”**

Whatever he was trying to say devolved into beeps and whistles my translator couldn’t parse.

I absent-mindedly petted him and turned to the Arxur.

“Hey, Not-Lady.  What’s with the audience?”

She’d know.  She was staring the same way the crowd did.  It took a couple finger snaps to break her out of the trance.

 “H-huh?  Oh … uh, do you know who you just … pounded into meat?” she asked.

I shrugged.  “He was important, then?”

“He was our *captain,”* she explained.  “He was … next in line for a Chief Hunter rank.  He’s good at *everything* he puts his claws to.  Unrivalled … undefeated …”

“Until now, I guess,” I supposed.

Her eyes flicked to my leg.  Oops.  I’d let my limp show.  The Captain’s attempt to crush my foot had done more than I’d let on.  I could practically see the thoughts behind her eyes.

*\~H-he’s hurt?  Surely he doesn’t have much fight left after that.  Is this my chance?  My only chance?  Maybe I could …?”*

She didn’t seem to realize she was leaning closer, jaws quivering open.

I reached out and pushed her chin up, shutting her mouth.

“Don’t think about it, sweetheart,” I smirked.

Her reptile pupils went round before her gaze fled to anything but me.  This weird, squeaky keen escaped her-

“Wait a minute, I did *not* just rizz up an Arxur,” I deadpanned.

***“WHAT!?”*** she trilled.  **“Of course not, you little-!”**

“Yes, yes, whatever,” I dismissed.  “You work this out, I got stuff to do.”

I strode back into the pit, leaving the Arxur blubbering after me.  She piped down for a moment as her attention turned to Lann.

“What are *you* looking at?” she hissed.

*“You,* obviously,” the Venlil replied.

I could hear the ear-waggle in his voice.

“Edible creatures should know when to hold their tongues,” she warned.

“No thanks.  I’d rather pull out yours, so don’t get any ideas, Not-Lady,” he shot back.

Judging by her silence, I think she was contemplating my ‘negative influence’ on prey in their formative years.

I cleared my throat.  “So, I heard you guys need a new captain.”

At the side of my eye, I caught Not-Lady’s jaw hitting the ground.

***“NOOO!”*** shrieked a heckler.  **“You think you can do this just ‘cause you beat our captain!?”**

“This has gone on long enough,” I asserted.  “All the cattle on this ship belongs to me, and your food storage is dwindling.  I’m *‘doing this’* as it is.  As captain, I will push for your defection to Earth’s forces.  No more starving.  No more fighting for a better life, knowing that you’ll likely never get it.  We’ll feed you better than Betterment, *treat you* better than Betterment.  Just say yes.”

**“… You’ll turn us into weaklings … like** ***YOU!”*** spat the heckler.

“I beat your best fighters.  What does that make *you?”* I parried.

**“No!  You still haven’t beaten Gazzim, Haktan and Berzal!”**

“Then send them into The Pit.  *Tonight,”* I challenged.  “If three of your best can’t beat me, you don’t deserve to decide what’s weak or strong.”

…

…

**“You’ll have to beat them all at once!”** insisted another.

Hisses of agreement rippled through the crowd.

I made a show of thinking.  “… So long as we get traditional melee weapons.”

**“AGREED!”**

The audience roared their approval.

**“We fight in** ***ONE HOUR!”*** I boomed.

The crowd went hype-wild.

I returned to my exit.  Lann was wagging his tail off while Not-Lady was having some kind of mental malfunction.

**---**

Gazzim, Haktan, Berzal and the audience cackled and pointed at my weapons of choice: ten little knives that were apparently used by assassins of Arxur past: great for discreet takedowns, bad for melee where the opponent *knew* what to expect.  They were particularly pathetic compared to the massive, overkill weapons my opponents picked out.

“Gazzim, Haktan, Berzal!” I barked.

They stopped laughing and turned narrowed eyes upon me.

“You come from a society of warriors,” I declared.  “You are strong, but are you strong enough to do something special?”

**“Do** ***what,*** **meat man?”** snarled Haktan.

“It takes strength to fight with honor and nobility when all the voices demand a kill,” I elaborated.  “Enough blood has been spilled.  I don’t want to lose any members of my future crew.  We can have a noble and honorable sparring match, or we kill each other for no reason.  Which-“

**“I’ll honor your** ***carcass!”*** hissed Gazzim.

The audience hissed laughter.

I nodded slowly.  *\~Very well.\~*

The fight master slapped his tail to the ground, signifying the beginning of a new battle.

**Thmp!  Thmp!  Thmp!  Thmp!**

Judging from the collective shock, no one expected me to *throw* the knives.  The [no reload](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxI8ZqKSXJMztEeEamZMBjMpR03_7GKg6y?si=yqFO3vZMnk0nZhp9) technique sure helped.  I’d nailed Haktan from the get-go.  Half-luck, half skill.  Gazzim caught on fast.  He began to evade.  It took about three throws before he was halfway crippled.  That’s when Berzal reached me and swung that five-foot greatsword.  The best way to dodge a sword was to be out of reach when it came.

***SHWINNG!***

So, I threw myself back.  Felt it slice the air short of my neck.  I hit the ground.  *Hard.*  I was down.  It should have been over.  At least, that’s what I presume Berzal thought.

He lunged.  His shadow fell upon me.  He’d abandoned all tact and defense, leaving himself wide open as he came down on ‘vulnerable’ prey.

I was counting on it.

**Thmp!**

They- they were … he’d just- how did this happen?

The puny, fangless, toothless terror rose to his feet.  His deadly gaze turned upon me.

“Shall I honor your carcass?” he growled.

My eyes flicked over the crowd.  They’d roared my name with hope and adoration, but gone were their cheers.  I could never stand tall among my peers again.

The Human Predator clicked his tongue.  “Hey.  Eyes on me.”

Our gazes locked.  I almost shrank back.  Maybe … he was right.  There was no honor here, and for all my fear of my peers, I feared The Human Predator more.

Finally, I broke the stare and lowered my head in submission.

The Human Predator’s lips lifted in a sober smile as he nodded.  “Very good.  Now, let me show you all a life of *honor.”*

My assistant stepped into my office, her brow knitted in thoughtful confusion.

“Is something the matter?” I asked.

“… Captain Caleb just contacted us from an Arxur ship,” she explained.  “He says he … um … *‘fought his way up the ranks’.*  Now he’s their captain, and he's requesting to bring a ‘crew’ of 83 Arxur, 206 rescued cattle and 17 Humans … to Earth, Sir.”

My mind returned to the present.  I’d honestly forgotten about Lmur, who was … um …

“Bro, what are you doing?” I asked.

He snapped out of it and looked up at me.

“Nibbling my ‘toe beans’?” he offered.

*“Why?”* I asked.

…

“I thought it would get your attention,” he fidgeted.

“And you’re trying to get my attention *because …?”*

“I don’t remember,” he confessed.

…

“Okay, wanna get lunch?” I suggested.

He perked up.  “Sure!  I wanna try that coffee place down the road.”

“Lmur, you do realize I’m authorized to taze you if you touch coffee on the job,” I repeated for the billionth time as I left.

*“Ugggggghhh …”* he groaned, dragging his feet after me.  “What am I?  Some wild animal you gotta put down the moment it-?”

An audible buzz tingled in my pocket.

“Excuse me one sec,” I requested, answering.  “Hey, Lady.  What’s up?”

“Hello, Gentleman.  Lann got into some kind of brawl with the Human kids,” she explained.  “He trounced them all, hahaha!”

“Is that a good thing?” I asked.

“They had it coming,” she chortled.  “He’s calling himself a ‘bully hunter’.  I find it quite endearing.  Anyway, the principal called us in for a meeting and I’m not really sure what to say or do.  Is it socially acceptable to slap him with my tail if he comes down too hard on my pup?”

*“… No,”* I clarified simply.

She hissed her frustration.  “I don’t understand how such a toothless society managed to create someone like you.”

“You’ll understand soon enough,” I sighed.  “Okay, I’ll coach you through this, and get me on holo when you have the meeting.”

She growled a sigh.  “Alright.  I’ll be in touch.”

I ended the call to find Lmur staring.  “What?”

“Did I just hear you talking to an Arxur?” he queried.

I shrugged.  “Yeah, so?”

He blinked at me.

I blinked back.

*The floating hands had multiplied.*

*They swarmed the couch in a petting frenzy, just the way I liked it.  I squeezed my muzzle up between them to get a few words out and, you know, to just generally, breathe.*

*“GAAASP!  So yeah.  Basically, they’re goobers.*  ***Dangerous,*** *selectively competent goobers, and I does love them baaad for it.*  *^(Yesh.  Right there under the chin.)*  *Oh, and that’s right, sucka!  After all this time, you just got hit by something akin to a filler episode!  Apparently, you were* ***supposed*** *to get a longer transcription, but admin is slowly figuring out that ‘burnout’ occurs whenever he releases transcriptions beyond a fuzzily defined size, ain’t that right,* u/The-Mr-E?”

u/The-Mr-E: *Please stop talking to me.  It’s unsettling.*

*I rolled my eyes.  “So anyway, you’ve seen what it looks like when a Human fights Arxur, but what happens when a Venbig cub steps into the ring?  Brkar's approach was ... different, to say the least.*  *^(A little higher, plz.)*  *Speaking of which, what even ARE Brkar and the original Rebra?  Has anyone figured it out?  Standby for more transcriptions and-* ***OW!”***

*The disembodied hands withdrew, each looking equally innocent, but I knew better.  I’d programmed them with pseudo-Human behavior.  On the bright side, they gave the best scritches.  On the downside cuteness aggression was always a risk.*

***“Who squeezed me!?  It was YOU, wasn’t it?”*** *I bleated, pointing a livid claw at* [*that one hand.*](https://youtu.be/j0EFSD4iPdo?si=YhTZEyKwpfEtDZei)  “*Alright.  This batch was a bust.  Back to the drawing boar-* ***eemph?“***

*The hand latched onto my muzzle and clamped it shut, silencing me.*

*Another hand wagged a finger, as though* ***I*** *were the misbehaving pet.*

*The hands swarmed and buried me again.  This time, pinching and pulling and squeezing and squishing.  They had nothing to lose, so all that pent up cuteness aggression was coming out in one rush of reckless abandon.*

*…*

*I* ***could*** *end this with a simple command prompt, but that would be boring.  I wanted to find out if I could make it through this with nothing but my Venlittle brains and the skin of my teeth.  In the absence of the ‘real’ world, self-manufactured unpredictability was important for my psyche.  These shenanigans were keeping me sane.*

*So anyway, I started biting.*

He has known ever since the beginning of our 6 year long relationship that I have very bad PTSD from childhood when it comes to yelling, throwing things, breaking things, and hitting things. He knows this and even watches me shut down, but still hasn't managed his anger. He's never hit me, though. He always gets angry when I tell people about the things he has said and done to me, even as of recently. We have 3 children together: 4 year old, 2 year old, and a 6 month old. I'm just at a loss of what to do. I applied for some jobs so that I can finally have awareness and a say so about our finances, and I plan on sharing these journal entries with my new therapist on the 24th. Any kind of advice, suggestions, or even any answers to why he keeps doing this will be greatly appreciated.

I just got out of the psych ward on the 16th. J (33M) went missing on the 20th. The 27th, he was found dead. I was struggling trying to figure out if I did have feelings for J the time he was missing or if it may have been something from my BPD. 

That same night, C already came back upset from work due to the everyday bullshit he has to deal with. He got snappy and upset with me that our middle child made another mess that he has been doing for the past few weeks. When I told him what happened to J, he quickly changed his tone with me. He told me to be open, honest, and fully out there about everything, so I did. 

That next morning, he is upset that I am just now telling him that I had feelings for J and threw it in my face that I got mad when he didn't tell me about S (26F). I reminded him that I didn't know I did until J died and that S and A (22MtF, 19 at the time C was cheating on me with her while I was pregnant with our 2 year old) were just a few of the multiple people he was cheating on me with and lying about. He apologizes, says he was in the wrong, and that he shouldn't have said it. He kept on going on about how me and J could have been together if it wasn't for him, that he should have treated me better, that J loved me and had feelings for me, that he should have been the man J was, and other things like that. I told him that I didn't know if J had feelings back and that I would never know, and that I am still pretty upset about him bringing up S. We had a few hard and deep conversations, then was starting to do better again. 

A few days ago, I made a post about J's death. C comes back home from work upset and I ask what was wrong. He said that I said only J was always there for me. I told him that I made it clear in the post that I was talking about our friendships and my general friends, then I told him that there were still so many times in the past that I needed him and he wasn't there. He gets more upset and says that he just needed reassurance that I just meant it in an only friend's way. We talk some more afterwards. 

It leads to me reminding him that I'm still scared about history. I have asked for years to be loved in my love languages and to just make me feel loved with things like touches and compliments. He finally did after 6 years...last year for a week after I was discharged from the psych ward on my first time going, then he quit completely. He didn't start to actually be there fully for me until J's death. He went on about how he couldn't do all of those things because he had to clean, do chores, run errands, and do rides after work and that it takes away from him being able to spend time with our kids and me. He then went on about how he is now able to be present and be here in the moment now because he got all of the cleaning and chores caught up when I was in the psych ward for a week a while back ago and that it's just a coincidence that it's happening again during another crisis. He also said that he understands that I am still seeing doctors and therapists to get the rest of my medications and get something figured out and that he wants to let me rest and take a break, especially after all of the losses this year and the traumas I'm still processing from the psych ward the last time. He needs me to keep on working to get better for my health and that I would then need to help out more at the house for him to keep having the chance to spend time with us because right now it's just work taking him away from us now.

The neighbor's daughter came over for a while to talk and hang out. They're getting evicted and her and her brother aren't in a good home situation, so I got them some food and an air mattress for the girl to have something to sleep on. Their mom ain't home at all. I wasn't expecting to have any kind of guests and she really needed someone to talk to because all of her people are in Florida. This is also the first time in weeks that I've gotten to sit down and actually talk to someone in person.

After she leaves, I apologize to C about being busy for a few hours with the neighbor and if there is anything else I can help with. He is upset and tells me that I need to not forget about him and the kids because they still need me to and that he already had everything done. I asked him earlier a few times if he was okay and if needed help and he kept saying that he was tired and that he gots it. I told him that I wish he would stop telling me that same phrase that him and the kids still need me and to not forget about them every time I get into an unexpected long conversation with someone and that he can just send me a text when he needs me to wrap up with company. He gets more upset and goes on to how he had to tend to the kids right after work and had to get them most of the day/night and that it is already late and that he has to go to bed now. He also said it felt like I was just brushing him off when he needs more help at home and that he had plans to clean today and now he has to do that tomorrow on his day off and he was hoping to be able to relax. He did apologize and also said that he'll need my help tomorrow. In the same breath, he was talking about how he knows I'm still going through a lot, but he still needs me to be able to do more at home. We just have some dishes, daily pick up, sweeping, and a few loads of laundry to do. He apologized the next day and said he only acted that way because he wanted to spend time with me.

I was telling C the other night about how his affair affected me and the few things that I still remember. How I had to bum and borrow money for him to have gas to go see her because he lied to me every time. I told him it messed with me to be borrowing money all that time while I was pregnant just for him to go cheat on me behind my back with A as he kept lying every time that she was just a friend and that he was going to tell her that were not polyam. I even told him how it hurt me when he knew I was crying, not eating or sleeping, that I was cutting and suicidal, and that I was even raped when I was pregnant with our son and he still kept cheating on me during it all. I was telling him that I've been struggling with suicidal idealation again and that I haven't been okay. I was asking him if he thought I was stupid and easy and some other things. I was telling him I was trying my best to do everything I can heal and to help fix us. I can't even fully remember what all I said and asked at this point. He got angry, was rubbing his head and blowing his breath. He said that he doesn't get why I keep bring these things up when he has done answered my questions and talked to me about it and that he wished I would stop with it. He also said he's done everything he can and that nothing he says works. He also told me that I haven't been doing everything I can because I haven't been taking my medications and talking to a therapist when he knows my old therapist only made things worse and that she only talked to me once every few months and that the psych ward refused to give me my medications and put me on new ones that was giving my health problems. He also said he felt like I was diminishing him and I told him I wasn't trying to do that and I was only trying to tell him how I felt. I told him that I always felt like he was angry with me and he said that he wasn't and that he doesn't mean to take his anger out on me and has been trying to be better about it. He then apologized and was telling me that he loved me and only me and that he wasn't going to cheat on me or abuse me again. I feel so frustrated and confused, especially since I can't fully remember everything we talked about that night. I told him days ago before that that I needed to vent to him and it never came and he told me it was because I never said anything. He always kept telling me that he only cheated on me because he was selfish, a horrible person, and that he purposefully distanced his self from me, but he finally said for the first time that he thought he was a good liar. He was always jealous of J, knowing we were just close friends, and didn't like any of my friends that were guys. He admitted that he was scared that I was going to leave him when it came to J's death and I've noticed the parttern has been more frequent ever since he passed away.

July 18th, 2025

I confronted C for more lies I found out about a few years ago. He got upset and started saying that he was sorry that he was wrong about how long he talked to girls he was cheating on me with, that I know his memory is bad, that he is always the bad guy and that he can't do nothing right no matter how good he is now, that he had a bad childhood, that I keep burying stuff up from the past to use against him, that I shouldn't be mad because he didn't know he talked to the two girls more often than he thought, and that I need to let go of the past and focus on the present for our future. He made a comment that it looks like that he's gonna have to keep his job now, strongly hinting at a break up. He was getting even angrier to the point he slung stuff around and got coffee every on the kitchen sink, wall, and counter. I had to lie about still wanting to be with him and apologize to try to get him to call down because he was starting to yell at our oldest daughter for making a mess. He then started to say that I need to not stay up late on the Xbox anymore, to get off my phone, that I need to watch other stuff that doesn't remind me of his abuse and cheating, and that I need to stop dwelling on the past. He also kept getting upset every time I tried to check my phone.

July 21st, 2025

I tried talking to C some more because he always knows when I'm upset and shit, so I couldn't lie through it. I told him that night triggered a lot of trauma in me. I told him what he said and he kept trying to deny he remarked ""looks like I'm going to have to keep my job now"" and kept on saying he doesn't remember that. Only other things he said were that he wishes we could move away from everyone we know, that he's tired of drama, that he hates how much his past keeps affecting things, and that he didn't know what else to say. Nothing else was said and probably ain't gonna be said. He mostly avoided talking about anything and said he was really tired. He was also saying that the conversation from the other day was a lot for him to take in, that he was overwhelmed, and that he was hurting a lot.",1,1753277599.0,abusiverelationships,0,1.0,False

1m79diw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1m79diw/does_the_keurig_kclassic_k50_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the Keurig K-Classic K-50 Coffee Maker Deliver on Convenience and Flavor?,"Testing out the Keurig K-Classic K-50 has been an adventure for me as a coffee enthusiast. It’s hard not to get drawn to its promise of simplicity and efficiency. Keurig’s reputation precedes itself, and I was curious if the K-50 would hold up to my caffeine-fueled mornings. From its design to brewing performance, I’ve put this single-serve coffee maker through its paces. Spoiler alert: it’s not without flaws, but it has enough merit to earn a spot on many countertops.

**Design and Build Quality**  
On my kitchen counter, the Keurig K-Classic K-50 manages to blend function with decent aesthetics. Its compact design, with dimensions of 9.8"" x 13.3"" x 13"", fits snugly between the toaster and my cutting board. The black finish gives it a minimal and sleek look, although the plastic build might feel less premium compared to pricier machines. Setting up was painless; buttons are nicely labeled, and honestly, even a caffeine-deprived zombie could operate it at six in the morning. I especially appreciated that the water reservoir is removable, making refilling or cleaning straightforward. Pro tip: wipe it down occasionally since the plastic tends to show smudges and water spots.

**Brewing Performance and Options**  
When it comes to coffee-making, this machine doesn’t disappoint. With its three brew sizes (6, 8, or 10 ounces), I’ve experimented with various cup sizes to suit different situations – from morning jolts to late-night sips. If you enjoy a bolder cup, I’d stick to the 6-ounce option; anything larger leaves the coffee tasting a bit diluted. Brewing itself? Quick and pretty quiet, though those first few gurgles of heating water can be a bit startling. I timed one of my cups, and in just under a minute, I had a steaming brew ready. That’s impressive, especially on mornings when I’m rushing to join yet another meeting.

**Ease of Maintenance and Cleaning**  
One thing I truly value in any kitchen gadget is how easy it is to clean. No one has time for fiddly maintenance. The K-50 takes a lot of the guesswork out with its simple auto-off and descaling reminders. Descaling was standard fare – a helpful feature that ensures calcium build-up doesn’t compromise performance. I do wish the machine came with a descaling solution in the box, though, because I had to look up what’s compatible. Another maintenance bonus is the removable drip tray, which accommodates taller travel mugs when brewing on-the-go-sized drinks. Too bad my mug collection now gets to argue which one fits best.

**Merits**  
After several months of daily use, the positives stand out easily:  
- Fast and user-friendly operation, ideal for busy mornings.  
- Flexibility in brewing sizes makes it adaptable to preferences.  
- Large 48-ounce reservoir reduces constant refilling.  

**Shortcomings**  
That being said, the coffee maker isn’t perfect:  
- Lack of adjustable temperature controls, which high-end coffee connoisseurs might miss.  
- Plastic parts feel slightly fragile and prone to wear over time.  

**Competing Products**  
Against other single-serve brewers in the same price range, the K-50 fares pretty well but isn’t entirely without competition. Compared to the Nespresso Essenza Mini, for instance, the Keurig offers infinitely more coffee pod options, including brands like Green Mountain and Starbucks. However, the Nespresso beats it slightly on premium build quality and flavor richness for espresso lovers. Another competitor worth mentioning is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. While the FlexBrew allows both ground coffee and pods, its brewing time pales in terms of speed, and the user interface isn’t as intuitive.

**Price Performance**  
Considering its features, the K-Classic K-50 hits a well-balanced price-to-quality ratio. Would I recommend it as an investment? Yes, for anyone seeking convenience and a decent range of brew customization options. It doesn’t break the bank yet fulfills the needs of a single-serve coffee maker with flair. Keep in mind, though, that frequent pod users may find themselves spending more down the line on K-Cups.

It had gotten to the point where I was drinking Yerba Mate tea, all day at work, plus iced teas and some coffee on the weekend. I was also taking pre-workout before going to the gym. I just felt frazzled and was so tired of the energy spikes and crashes.  I quit cold turkey exactly one year ago and not going to lie, the first week was really, really rough. I had the worst headache of my entire life for at least three days (shout out to whoever suggested the hot sauce method of getting rid of a headache because that is literally the only thing that worked). But now it’s one year later. My energy levels are so much more even, I get less headaches overall and I’m just calmer as a person. It’s totally worth it. I rarely miss it or think about it.  I live off herbal tea now and love it.  I will say I have also incorporated more naps into my life where I can and that’s definitely helped too.  Tons of luck to everybody on their caffeine free journey and thanks to everyone who posts about their journey, you motivated me to make my life better!",8,1753277543.0,decaf,5,0.9,False

1m79cpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyWeightLoss/comments/1m79cpa/counting_calories_felt_impossible_until_this_app/,Counting calories felt IMPOSSIBLE until this app does it all for me!,"Hey Redditors, right, for me, and for most of my life, I never really cared about calories. I’d just eat what I felt like, thinking portion control alone would be enough. But the truth is, I had no idea how calorie-dense my meals were until I started tracking them properly.

The problem was, traditional calorie counting apps felt tedious. Manually entering every ingredient, searching databases, scanning barcodes. It took so much time, and even more when eating out or grabbing takeaways (which I do quite a lot!).

That’s why I co-founded MealSnap, an iOS app that uses AI to calculate calories instantly from a simple photo. Just snap a picture of your meal, and it gives you calorie estimates, macronutrient breakdowns, health ratings, and even the NOVA food processing score, all in seconds. It also saves your meal data securely so you can see your eating habits over time.

Here's the iPhone version if you’re curious, [https://apps.apple.com/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854](https://apps.apple.com/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854)

Using MealSnap made me realise my daily coffee runs were adding up to hundreds of extra calories a week, and that some “healthy” salads had more calories than a burger meal. Seeing this instantly from a photo changed the way I order food and build my meals at home.

Has anyone else here tried photo-based calorie tracking...? Did it change how you approached your diet and calorie intake?",1,1753277500.0,HealthyWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

I (23m) saw my kind of ex (22f) at a cafe yesterday.,"Back in January I was seeing a girl (22f). Let’s call her Emma, my ex (25f), let’s call her Sydney, at the time was still in my life because I made the decision to let her back in during the fall semester. Sydney was toxic and overall just a really bad person and I had a hard time saying no to her. When Sydney found out about Emma, after she basically forced me to tell her.  (I wanted to talk to my therapist first which I communicated to Emma because Sydney is known for just violently blowing up). I also had to tell her because Emma wanted me to cut her off and I wanted to cut her off too out of respect for my relationship, Sydney absolutely lost it. It resulted in my losing Emma. This was a girl I had a crush on for years and can honestly say I was in love with her… we talked for a month where everything was going fine. She had been my rock for a few years and it continued into our relationship. When I lost her it was honestly so difficult for months I thought about it, the situation, and her. I couldn’t get over it. I grieved someone who was still alive and I was just so angry all of the time. 

Fast forward to last month. I reach out and got no answer, which was my answer. It made me sad but I tried to keep my head down and move on. Then yesterday I went to a cafe with a friend to play Minecraft. I was fighting with my computer when over the top of my laptop in walks Emma. She must have seen me because she disappeared, I am assuming she left. This is a cafe we used to go to together but I figured it was safe to go during the summer because maybe there was no course work for her to do. So I went because I was craving their coffee and it seemed like a nice place to play games…. Anyways. She was gone for about 10-15 minutes before appearing again. She got in line made her order then went to the other side to take pictures. After a few minutes I see her pack up and I thought oh maybe she is leaving. Keep in mind at this point my hands are violently shaking… I couldn’t even type without having to retype and I felt incredibly nauseous. The girl I am still deeply in love with is standing 10 ft away from me and there is nothing I can say to her. Instead of leaving though she walks starts to walk to my corner, I freak out thinking she is going to say something, but she sits down two tables down from where I was sitting. Am I the only one that finds this odd? She had an entire cafe but instead she chose to sit near me? Was it to prove a point to herself/me or was she nosey as to who I was with? I cannot stop thinking about it. It makes me feel sick. ",7,1753277469.0,AmIOverreacting,9,1.0,False

Selling as it is quite light (250g not what the scale says) and with my cats I often stress about leaving it on the counter if I need to step away for a sec. Brewing is a decompress for me and this carafe takes that away. Other than that I loved it.

I've been to Miami several times, but this trip was special because I finally got to experience everything I wanted without feeling rushed.

Day 1: South Beach & Art Deco District
Started my morning walking down Ocean Drive, taking in the famous Art Deco architecture. The buildings are stunning, especially early morning when there aren't many people around. Had breakfast at Front Porch Cafe - their avocado toast is worth the hype.

Spent the afternoon at South Beach. The water was crystal clear and the atmosphere was exactly what you'd expect from Miami Beach. Pro tip: bring your own umbrella, the beach chair rentals are overpriced.

Evening: Dinner at Joe's Stone Crab. Yes, it's touristy, but the stone crabs are legitimately amazing. Make reservations in advance.

Day 2: Everglades Adventure
This was honestly the highlight of my trip. Took an airboat tour through the Everglades with Gator Park. Saw dozens of alligators in their natural habitat, plus all kinds of birds and even some turtles. The guide was super knowledgeable and funny. The wildlife show afterward was entertaining - watching the alligator wrestling was intense!

I booked through this link and saved some money: https://athometouch.com/miami 

Quick tip: Go early in the morning when it's cooler and the animals are more active. The whole experience takes about 2 hours.

Evening: Explored Little Havana. Had dinner at Versailles Restaurant - their Cuban sandwich and cortadito coffee are must-tries. Watched locals playing dominos at Domino Park.

Day 3: Culture & Shopping
Morning: Visited the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. This place is incredible - feels like you've been transported to a European villa. Spent about 2 hours exploring the gardens and mansion.

Afternoon: Shopping at the Design District and Wynwood. The street art in Wynwood is amazing, and the boutiques in the Design District are worth checking out even if you're just window shopping.

Evening: Dinner at KYU in Wynwood. Their Korean fried chicken is incredible. Finished the night with drinks at Sugar rooftop bar - best views of the city.

Transportation Tips:
- Used Uber/Lyft most of the time
- Parking in South Beach is expensive and difficult
- If staying in downtown, the free Metromover is convenient

Where to Stay:
I stayed in Brickell and it was perfect - central location, safe area, lots of restaurants nearby. Mid-Beach is also good if you want more of a resort experience.

Weather Note:
Went in October - perfect weather, less crowds, and lower prices than peak season.

Final Thoughts:
Three days is enough to see the highlights, but you'll definitely want to come back. Miami has this perfect mix of nature, culture, and city life that makes it unique. The Everglades tour was definitely the standout experience - it's something you can't do anywhere else.",1,1753277390.0,TripWanderers,0,1.0,False

It happens to be one of the only places to stop between Capitol City and a variety of destinations further south across several states. We're in full summer swing, which means sold out weekends and lots of late arrivals. 

For context, I always wear a face mask at work, at least in the lobby (and most of the time in the back). Consequently,  I get a lot of questions. Not gonna argue why, I'm sick of it, and this post is about *me not arguing about why.* 


I checked in this guy over the weekend, young ish boomer age. He was pleasant enough, went to  get the cart and fetch his wife. She comes in without the luggage and lurks in the corner of my lobby by the coffee station, which is where the hallway leading to the guest rooms is. I greet  her and go back to doing my thing.  She's peeking at me while I'm filing paperwork and running reports.

 Suddenly she says,  ""Do you have Covid?"" 

""No."" I look at her and smile with my eyes, then back to highlighting and using my kitty stamp. (I am a very professional grown- up night auditor who color codes my reports and uses a personal kitty stamp as well as my initials to sign my stuff.)

The silence stretches.

""Is there an outbreak nearby?""

Again, I look up, eye contact.  ""Not any more than usual."" Print off another report. The silence has stretched into taffy, reaching across  the lobby and trying to suffocate me. But i hate taffy, so i don't bite.  

Her husband is having trouble parking. She's feeling so awkward I can palpably feel it. I staple another report and note that I'm running low on rainbow staples and need to grab my sharpies and make more (again, very professional adult here)

She shifts her weight, looking around the lobby and sighs.  ""I guess I'm wondering why you're wearing a mask.""

I look at her one last time.  ""I work with the public during the height of travel season."" Thankfully her husband comes in just then, cheerfully wrangling the luggage cart and a very energetic brown dog on a leash. I direct them to the elevator and wish them a good night.

I work in an office setting, which is your typical 9-5, and during my off-hours I study for my LSATS as I am currently hoping to attend law school. I live with my boyfriend (25M), who is a successful entrepreneur, and he furthermore pays for our rent, which again, is a contributing factor as to why I feel like I may be overreacting and shouldn’t ultimately have a say in this.

Essentially, my boyfriend has created an in-house office for him and his employees on the main level of the house (aka the living room/kitchen). It isn’t what you would call your “typical office politics” - they’re all his close friends (3-4 dudes without including my boyfriend) he has trained to work for him - and in turn they don’t necessarily work all the time. It’s become more so them hanging out for long periods of time, with no real cut at “5pm”. I’ll come home to them still in our kitchen “working” which a majority of the time is just them hanging out - they won’t leave until 9 or 10pm sometimes and after a long day of work at my 9-5, when I just want to come home to relax for a bit, and then get to studying, I find it incredibly hard to do so. The only “space” for me to work is the kitchen table, which again, is situated in the middle of their “office space” and these boys are loud. Like I’ve said before, there’s definitely work being done because the business is successful, but there’s a lot of hanging out and chilling happening. My boyfriend is opposed to putting a desk in our bedroom for some reason - “will distract us from sleep” - and even if we were to, again, they are so loud. I was home sick the other day and I could hear every word as they were discussing women they found hot downstairs. And as awful as it sounds, and this is where I feel like I am overreacting, I don’t like to come home to a whole room of guys everyday and be forced in their vicinity as I clean, and eat, and try to de-wind. Half of the time - I have to clean up after them because they trash the “office space” which is just our living room/kitchen. 

I’ve started trying to force myself to go to coffee shops after work because I simply can’t study when they are around - but I find myself so irritated as I come home and see them still there at 9/10pm knowing I have to clean up after them and then go back to work the next day and repeat it all over again. I just really wish they cleaned up after themselves and tried to leave closer to 5pm, or if they could at least not yell so much.

I feel like I am being spoiled. I hate that I think like this when my boyfriend is providing our living space and, in turn, he should be using his space as he pleases - I can’t tell why this irks me so much. AIO? ",16,1753277236.0,AmIOverreacting,50,0.86,False

Review inside!,"The Waterdrop WD-F05 refrigerator water filter replacement truly offers a compelling case for anyone in need of a dependable water filtration solution. From its design to its performance, this product stands out in many ways. Having had the chance to test it myself with my trusty LG fridge, I’ve gained a clear understanding of both the strengths and shortcomings of this excellent yet affordable filter. Let’s dive into the details.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I have to admit, the first thing that struck me was the solid build of this product. The Waterdrop WD-F05 replacement filter feels durable, crafted from high-quality coconut shell carbon block. It’s refreshingly lightweight at 1.97 pounds, yet sturdy. Its dimensions, 9.53"" in depth, 3.34"" in width, and 5.59"" in height, make it an ideal fit for a variety of refrigerator models. I was able to pop this filter into my LG fridge (LFX25974ST model, to be precise) without any tools. That ease of installation is no small thing when you’re juggling other household tasks.

**Advanced Filtration Technology**  
With its NSF 42 and NSF 372 certification, I felt reassured about the quality of water I was getting. After running the system for a couple of weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in taste. This filter is not only efficient at reducing chlorine, bad taste, and odor, but it also proved effective in eliminating impurities like cysts, rust, and corrosion. Another key trait to mention? It retains essential minerals—something I found unique when compared to previous filters I’ve used.  

**Highlights**  
- Easily fits various LG fridge models like LMX25964ST and LSXS26366S.  
- Advanced filtration keeps beneficial minerals intact.  
- Installation is a breeze with no tools needed.  
- Includes handy complimentary install stickers for tracking its 6-month lifespan.

**Performance in Action**  
In my household, water means everything. Routine morning cups of coffee, quick hydration after runs, preparing soups—it’s an everyday essential. This filter has performed impressively across all these tasks. What stood out most to me, though, is how it handles high usage without compromising water flow. Over the course of a month, even with our household using up to 300 gallons, I encountered no slowdowns, no leaks. It's reliable.

**Boons**  
- Compact design complements most kitchen needs.  
- Uses coconut shell carbon for eco-friendliness.  
- Enhanced filtration technology effectively reduces water impurities.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Not universally compatible—be sure to check refrigerator model compatibility.  
- Activated carbon block may slightly discolor at the end of its lifespan (cosmetic flaw).  
- Some reviews mention difficulty finding replacement stickers over time.

**Competing Brands**  
To provide a fair perspective, I checked Whirlpool and Samsung refrigerator water filters. Whirlpool’s models, while capable, lack the precision fit that Waterdrop offers, and they’re typically harder to install. Samsung filters are great for their sleek design, but the taste improvement isn’t as noticeable, and they often fall short in terms of pricing. Where Waterdrop excels is in making high-quality filtration accessible without compromises.

**Quality for Price**  
It’s evident to me that this product balances affordability with reliability. While premium filters often market themselves at unnecessarily high price points, this one delivers at a more reasonable range. Adds to my peace of mind that it won’t burn a hole in my pocket for its features. That being said, this filter isn’t about luxury but practicality.

1m797ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1m797ce/vibration_plate_weight_loss_plan_combining_diet/,"Vibration Plate Weight Loss Plan: Combining Diet, Cardio & Vibration for Optimal Results","So you've been staring at that vibration plate in your living room (or maybe you're still browsing Amazon :) ), wondering if this shaky contraption can actually help you shed those stubborn pounds? Well, grab a coffee and let me tell you about my journey with vibration plate weight loss – spoiler alert: it works, but not quite how you'd expect.

## What's the Real Deal with Vibration Plates?

Look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this – **vibration plates aren't magic weight-loss machines**. I know, I know, the infomercials make it look like you can just stand there for 10 minutes and suddenly have abs like a Greek god. Trust me, I tried that approach first, and my scale laughed at me.

Here's what actually happens: these plates create **whole-body vibrations** that force your muscles to contract rapidly. We're talking 30-50 contractions per second. Your body thinks it's working harder than it actually is, which means you burn more calories and engage muscle fibers you didn't even know existed.

But here's the kicker – **you still need to put in the work**. The vibration plate is more like a really good wingman than the star of the show.

## Building Your Vibration Plate Weight Loss Foundation

### The Diet Component: Your Non-Negotiable Starting Point

Ever heard the saying ""abs are made in the kitchen""? Well, it's annoyingly true. You can vibrate yourself silly, but if you're still crushing pizza every night (guilty as charged), you won't see the results you want.

Here's what I learned the hard way:

**Focus on these fundamentals:**
- **Protein intake**: Aim for 0.8-1g per pound of body weight
- **Hydration**: At least 8 glasses daily (your muscles need this for recovery)
- **Whole foods**: Minimize processed junk – your body will thank you
- **Portion control**: Use smaller plates if you have to (it actually works!)

FYI, I'm not saying you need to eat like a monk. I still have my weekend treats, but **consistency during the week makes all the difference**.

### The Cardio Connection: Making Your Heart Happy

Now, about that cardio – you knew this was coming, right? The beauty of combining **traditional cardio with vibration training** is that you get more bang for your buck.

**My weekly cardio schedule looks like this:**
- 3 days of moderate cardio (20-30 minutes)
- 2 days of HIIT sessions (15-20 minutes)
- 2 days of active recovery (walking, stretching)

The vibration plate sessions don't replace your cardio – they **amplify it**. Think of it as cardio with a turbo boost.

## Crafting Your Vibration Plate Workout Strategy

### Beginner-Friendly Vibration Sessions

Starting out? Don't go full beast mode on day one (learned this lesson with sore muscles that lasted a week). Here's a **realistic beginner approach**:

**Week 1-2: Getting Acquainted**
- 10-minute sessions, 3 times per week
- Focus on basic positions: standing, squats, planks
- Low intensity settings (around 20-30 Hz)

**Week 3-4: Stepping It Up**
- 15-minute sessions, 4 times per week
- Add lunges, push-ups, and calf raises
- Medium intensity (30-40 Hz)

### Advanced Vibration Training Techniques

Once you've got your vibration legs (yes, that's a thing), you can get creative. Here are some **game-changing advanced moves**:

**High-Intensity Vibration Circuit:**
- **Vibration squats**: 45 seconds on, 15 seconds rest
- **Plank holds**: 30 seconds on, 30 seconds rest
- **Lateral lunges**: 45 seconds on, 15 seconds rest
- **Push-up variations**: 30 seconds on, 30 seconds rest

Repeat this circuit 3-4 times, and you'll definitely feel it tomorrow!

## The Science Behind the Shake

### How Vibration Training Accelerates Fat Loss

Here's where things get interesting. **Vibration training doesn't just burn calories during your workout** – it keeps your metabolism elevated for hours afterward. This phenomenon, called EPOC (excess post-exercise oxygen consumption), means you're torching calories even while binge-watching Netflix later.

The vibrations also improve **lymphatic drainage**, which helps reduce that annoying water retention. IMO, this is why people often see results on the scale pretty quickly with vibration training.

### Muscle Activation and Hormonal Benefits

Want to know something cool? Vibration training activates **up to 97% of your muscle fibers** compared to about 40% during conventional exercise. That's like getting a premium workout without the premium effort.

Plus, these sessions trigger the release of **growth hormone and testosterone** (yes, women need testosterone too!), which are crucial for fat burning and muscle building.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Your Results

### Mistake #1: Going Too Hard, Too Fast

I see people hopping on vibration plates like they're trying to achieve liftoff. **Start slow and build intensity gradually**. Your body needs time to adapt to this new stimulus.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Proper Form

Just because you're on a vibrating surface doesn't mean form goes out the window. **Maintain proper posture and alignment** – your future self will thank you when you're not dealing with injuries.

### Mistake #3: Expecting Overnight Miracles

Real talk: **sustainable weight loss takes time**. I started seeing noticeable changes around week 6, but everyone's different. Don't get discouraged if you don't see dramatic results immediately.

## Maximizing Your Results: Pro Tips from Experience

### Timing Your Sessions

**Morning sessions work best for me** – they kickstart my metabolism and give me energy for the day. But honestly, the best time is whenever you can be consistent.

### Recovery and Rest Days

Your muscles grow and repair during rest, not during workouts. **Take at least one full rest day per week** from vibration training. Light walking or gentle yoga is fine, but give those muscle fibers a break.

### Tracking Progress Beyond the Scale

The scale can be a liar sometimes :/. **Track these metrics instead:**
- Body measurements (waist, hips, arms)
- Progress photos
- How your clothes fit
- Energy levels and sleep quality

## Creating Your Personal Success Formula

### Week-by-Week Progression Plan

**Weeks 1-4: Foundation Building**
- 3 vibration sessions per week
- 2-3 cardio sessions
- Focus on form and consistency

**Weeks 5-8: Intensity Increase**
- 4 vibration sessions per week
- 3-4 cardio sessions
- Add compound movements

**Weeks 9-12: Results Optimization**
- 4-5 vibration sessions per week
- Varied cardio intensities
- Fine-tune diet based on results

### Nutrition Timing for Maximum Impact

**Pre-workout**: Light snack with protein and carbs (banana with almond butter works great)

**Post-workout**: Protein within 30 minutes (protein shake or Greek yogurt)

**Throughout the day**: **Consistent meal timing helps regulate your metabolism**

## The Reality Check: What to Actually Expect

Let me be brutally honest – **vibration plates aren't going to transform you into a fitness model overnight**. What they will do is accelerate your results when combined with proper diet and cardio.

In my experience, people typically see:
- **Improved muscle tone** within 3-4 weeks
- **Noticeable fat loss** around weeks 6-8
- **Significant body composition changes** by month 3

**The key is consistency**. Miss a bunch of sessions and wonder why you're not seeing results? Yeah, that won't work.

## Your Next Steps to Vibration Success

Ready to give this a serious shot? Here's your action plan:

Start with **realistic expectations and a solid foundation**. Get your diet dialed in first – that's 70% of your results right there. Add your cardio routine and then introduce vibration training as your secret weapon.

Remember, **this isn't about perfection – it's about progress**. Some days you'll crush your workout, other days you'll barely get through it. Both are perfectly normal.

The combination of diet, cardio, and vibration training creates a synergistic effect that can seriously accelerate your weight loss journey. But like anything worthwhile, it requires patience, consistency, and a willingness to show up even when you don't feel like it.

I’m not sure where I met Steve H. but it was love at first sight. Not physical love, though looking back, I don’t think he would have minded that.

I was in love with the fact that he had been there for almost two years, and he had enough seniority to get us a better room in the Towers Hotel and out of my seven-man room in the rundown 129 building.

The Society had rented three floors in an old rundown hotel in Brooklyn Heights called *The Towers Hotel.* These rooms all had their own bathrooms. They went up for bid. If these rooms had been in the 119, 107 or 124 buildings, you would have needed at least ten-years seniority to secure one. The rooms in The Towers Hotel were two blocks from the main complex and still had a bunch of worldly people living in there. So, none of the older Bethelites wanted to live there. The *New boys,* however, who wanted a decent room and didn’t want to live with six or seven other guys, jumped at the opportunity. Plus, because of all of the old timers in the 119, 107 and 124 buildings, you had to always be on your best behavior.

Steve H. and I were part of the first group of guys to move into The Towers Hotel in 1971. We got room T-211. It had a beautiful view overlooking ventilators directly over the Towers ballroom. Some Saturday nights, the bed would almost vibrate off the floor from Carlos Santana’s music down in the ballroom. Those Puerto Ricans knew how to have fun at a wedding reception, that’s for sure.

Another fond memory from that room came from a hot July afternoon. I was trying to get some sleep because I was on the night shift. Everyone had windows open, trying to catch a little breeze. Back then, none of the rooms at Bethel had air conditioning. That saved them lots of money. Some homesick new boy next door played John Denver’s *Country Roads* sixty-seven times in a row. I guess he was missing West Virginia.

I remember on one of my trips to Greenwich Village seeing two guys walking down a street and kissing each other on the lips. I was totally shocked. I was twenty-one and really knew nothing about homosexuals. I’d never met any growing up and even if I had met one, I wouldn’t have known it.

To say we were homophobic a t Bethel was putting it mildly.

A group of Bethelites even beat up a couple of gay guys one night in *the Heights*. They felt bad about their actions the next day and went to the home overseer, George Couch, to confess their unchristian behavior.

George sat there with a smile on his face and told them, “Don’t worry about it boys, just don’t do it again.” The story spread like wildfire through Bethel. Basically, if you wanted to beat up some homosexuals, no big deal; the powers that be are looking the other way.

Their attitude was: Since god is going to kill all of them all off pretty soon at Armageddon, why should he have all the fun.

We were taught that homosexuality was the ultimate sin and even worse than fornication. It was the reason why Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by god himself.

Before I go on, I must say that because I was raised a Jehovah’s Witness, I was a staunch homophobic for most my life. I’m not that person now. My heart goes out to the thousands of gays who have left the Jehovah’s Witness organization and thus lost their families because of their sexual orientation. They are part of our society and should be accepted as such.

However, I don’t feel the same way about pedophiles.

The Organization will tell you that there is zero tolerance for any pedophiles and homosexuals in the Jehovah’s Witness organization. That is why all known gays had been kicked out and disfellowshipped before I arrived. Of course, one would think that obviously all gays and pedophiles would be kicked out and disfellowshipped if found there in the future.

Sorry, I should say *most* homosexuals and pedophiles were kicked out in disgrace. Unless the president and his buddies liked you. Then you could leave Bethel with no disgrace and even pioneer if you like! Hell, they might even send you a check every month, too. You had to be in their club, of course. *The good old boys club*, that is.

Which homosexuals did they like? How about two members of the *Governing Body?* Remember, the *Governing Body?* These were the top leaders of the *Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.* At the time, there were seventeen members on the Governing Body, two of whom were gay. That meant that more than 11 percent were gay. Since these men were all appointed by god’s Holy Spirit maybe god liked gays more than the Society would like to admit.

Governing Body member Ewart Chitty (born ca. 1898) entered the London Bethel in 1921, began to work in the office and by 1938 held some sort of official position. By 1942, Chitty was secretary of the International Bible Students Association (IBSA), the Societies’ British equivalent of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. Somewhere along the line he was appointed as Secretary Treasurer of the IBSA, a position he held until his appointment to the Governing Body in November 1974. He wasn’t a member of the Governing Body for very long because he resigned in 1979. However, Chitty remained in Brooklyn working in Writing Correspondence, so it seems he was certainly in good standing. According to close acquaintances, Chitty was drinking heavily by 1979. This likely contributed to him being dismissed from Brooklyn Bethel and reassigned to the London Bethel a few years later. There he worked on an assignment with little responsibility, but he was appointed an Elder in a local congregation. Chitty died about 1993. As to Chitty’s homosexuality, he certainly made some remarks in his 1963 life story in The Watchtower that leaned in this direction. By then, he had roomed with the same man for 30 years. When in Brooklyn, Chitty seems to have preferred younger men as roommates. In 1979, an actual charge was brought to the Governing Body against Chitty by a former roommate (not his thirty-year boyfriend) and involved some sort of inappropriate conduct. The powers-that-be concluded that Chitty had homosexual tendencies, whatever that meant, and asked him to resign from the Governing Body. Chitty could hardly do anything but comply with the rest of the Governing Body’s wishes, since his only alternative would have been to leave Bethel at age 81. He had been there for 58 years. It may well be that the Governing Body didn’t view Chitty as guilty of homosexual activity, since he remained a Bethel member in Brooklyn or London. But it may also be that they made a deal – Chitty would remain quiet about where “the dead bodies” (secrets) were buried as long as the Society cared for him in his old age.

If he hadn’t been guilty of molesting his roommate, why would he have ever resigned as a *Governing Body* member?

Our next Governing Body member was not really a homosexual but he was a pedophile.

Leo K. Greenlees entered the Toronto, Canada, Bethel in 1936, eventually becoming Treasurer of the Canadian branch and of the IBSA of Canada. In 1964, he went to Brooklyn Bethel, and in 1965, he was elected as a director of the Societies’ New York Corporation. As a director, Greenlees automatically became a Governing Body member when that body was formally instituted in 1971. He often spoke at Gilead graduations and was the concluding speaker for the day at the Watchtower Centennial business meeting at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 6, 1984. A 1982 Watchtower publication mentions him as being on the Teaching Committee of the Governing Body. Leo Greenlees was last mentioned in Watchtower publications in the December 1, 1984 Watchtower issue where he is said to have passed out diplomas at the September Gilead graduation.

In late 1984, Greenlees was convicted by the other *Governing Body members* of molesting a ten-year-old boy. The boy’s parents had complained to the Society and it took action. Greenlees was a friend of the family and often visited them.

Leo Greenlees was the overseer of the Green Point congregation in Queens. He was a *Bethel Elder and Governing Body member.* He was a homosexual and pedophile. He really loved the Brothers, especially the younger ones.

He raped young Mark Palo when he was just ten years old. Mark was just one of many others. Mark, in an interview on *YouTube*, mentions he had been abused by Leo and another Jehovah’s Witness.

How did the powers-that-be deal with this pedophile when he was caught in 1984? What punishment was administered? What example did they make of one of their own?

They gave Leo a *golden parachute* and asked him to leave. That’s right, could you please just go someplace else? He wasn’t kicked out in disgraced and wasn’t disfellowshipped. They even let him special pioneer, so of course he got an allowance from the society every month like all special pioneers do!

After he left Bethel, Leo became a special pioneer in the New Orleans area for a while and then moved around to many different congregations over the next few years. He moved around like most pedophiles do until they’re stopped. However, Leo was never stopped. He proved to be untouchable. He had unlimited *get out of jail free cards* for the rest of his life!

I ran into him in Mexico in the late 1980s, when I was there on vacation with my wife. I had known him at Bethel because he was my roommate Jack Sutton’s presiding overseer in the Green point congregation.

Leo was a *special pioneer* in Mexico at the time. I didn’t know his history back then. As we were having a cup of coffee together at my hotel, I do remember thinking to myself, so why would someone who was on the *Governing Body* (which is, of course, the highest possible position a person could obtain in the organization) be a *special pioneer* in Mexico now? Why not a Branch or Zone overseer....why a *special Pioneer?* This made no sense to me and was very strange indeed.

However, now the pieces of the puzzle fit together so nicely.

I also remember him telling me how he had many Bible studies, mostly with younger boys. Big surprise.

So back to Leo leaving Bethel, the only reprimand he ever received was the announcement at the world headquarters one morning in 1984 at breakfast: “Leo Greenlees is no longer a Bethelite. End of the matter.”

Of course, they wanted this to be the “end of the matter.” They swept him and his predisposition for young boys under the rug and wanted him as far away from them at the world headquarters as possible.

Oh, yes, the Society even admitted they had a problem with their leaders. A January 1, 1986 Watchtower article (p. 13) stated: “Shocking as it is, some who have been prominent in Jehovah’s organization have succumbed to homosexuality and child molesting.”

In the Watchtower article, they didn’t disclose the rest. What they should have said is this: “Shocking as it is, some who have been prominent in Jehovah’s organization have succumbed to homosexuality and child molesting and we have done NOTHING about it!” That is the *shocking* part they conveniently left out of the article, not that people could do this, but that the leaders there would do nothing about it when it happens.

Who was the article talking about? For some odd reason, they didn’t go into any details or name any names. Big surprise.

Yes, they spoke out and condemned it in their publications, but they let it slide when it really mattered. The funny thing is, I knew nothing about these matters when I was a Jehovah’s Witness. Yet all of this information is out there in plain sight.

Now, of course, for the big question: Why would they let Leo go free and endanger the welfare of who knows how many young people in their organization and elsewhere?

Maybe there is another story here that we are not seeing. The bigger picture, as they say. Let’s follow the money. After Leo left Bethel, he was a *special pioneer.* Leo was being paid directly by the Society every month up to the day he died. Leo was not in disgrace and enjoyed his position of prominence for the rest of his life. Yet, he was buggering young boys moving from congregation to congregation. Why wasn’t he stopped? Why did they turn a blind eye and paid him off as well?

What was Leo’s position at Bethel? He was the secretary treasurer of the all of the *Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.* This was and is one of the most powerful positions at the world headquarters. Meaning he knew EVERYTHING about the Societies’ finances. Which of course means he had full knowledge of how they moved their money around. He knew everything about ALL their financial dealings and because of that, he had them by the balls, and they of course knew it.

He had so much dirt on them that if any of his actions came to light, he had the power to blast the *Watchtower Bible and Tract Society* back to the time of the great *Miracle Wheat scandal* of 1911.

In 1911 Brother Russell was selling ordinary wheat that sold for about ninety cents a bushel for sixty dollars a bushel. Of course, the real *miracle* indeed was that people were stupid enough to buy it at that price.

My guess is, when Leo was caught, he told them what his terms would be. They of course had no choice but to agree with his demands and play ball, if they wanted their organization to survive.

There are only two options here. Leo Greenlees was in the *good old boy club* and he had a *get out of jail free card.* Or maybe he wasn’t. He was just another pervert at Bethel who had a lot of nasty information about the Society and their corrupt dealings. He played his ace, and threatened to use this information on them. In which case, he got the same *get out of jail free card.*

Either way, *The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York and Pennsylvania* are blood guilty. They have hidden pedophiles in their organization in the past. They are hiding them today, and they seem to want to continue this practice into the future.

The A&E Channel made this painfully clear in 2018 on their show *Cults and Extreme Beliefs,* season one, episode two: *Jehovah’s Witnesses.*

There are hundreds of cases on the Internet of Elders who have turned a blind eye to these sexual predators. These young people are now coming forward and saying, “No more!”

The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society have put their own self-interest ahead of the wellbeing of their people and their people’s children – the *flock* they are supposed to be protecting. I guess they don’t mind if a few lambs in their *flock* get screwed along the way!

The leaders of the organization (the good shepherds) tell their followers they should all be just like *sheep.* Why would they say that? Well, because we all know sheep are always afraid of wolves; however in the end, it is actually the shepherd who eats some of them, while he fleeces the rest of the flock.

Of course, most Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t know that a few years back until they settled out of court, *The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society* was being fined $4,000 a DAY by the State of California for not turning over the names of all the active pedophiles in their organization.

The Witnesses will be quick to point out: “We don’t hate the people, we just hate their actions.” Really? In Leo Greenlees case, I guess they hated neither the person nor his actions.

They did dis-fellowship a member of their Governing Body a few years earlier. His name was Raymond Franz. He was Fred Franz’s nephew. When I was at Bethel, Ray was considered one of the most approachable members of the *Governing Body.* He was a very humble person and loved by many. What was his crime?

Raymond Franz, Ed Dunlap and Lyman Swingle were doing research as writers for the new *Aid to Bible Understanding* book. They researched the time lines, which were based upon the cornerstone date of 1914 as being the end of the Gentiles Times. This was the time period supposedly running for two-thousand, five-hundred-and-twenty years since 607 BC. Franz tells of how he sent his personal secretary Charles Ploeger to visit the New York City libraries to try and substantiate this date for the destruction of Jerusalem. No such evidence was forthcoming. Instead, the date 587-586 BC was reinforced. Later, in 1977, a Swedish Elder sent a great deal of documentation based upon over ten-thousand cuneiform tablets found in the Mesopotamian area that dated back to the time of ancient Babylon, which substantiated that the destruction of Jerusalem was not 607 BC, but twenty years later. After Ray Franz left Bethel, he wrote a book, *Crisis of Conscience*. In it he states, “Much of the time and space under the Aid book heading of \`Chronology’ was spent in trying to weaken the credibility of the archeological and historical evidence that would make erroneous our 607 BC date and give a different starting point for our calculations and therefore an ending date different from 1914.”

Franz and his secretary even took a trip to Brown University in Rhode Island to interview Professor Abraham Sachs, a specialist in ancient cuneiform texts, in an attempt to find a weakness or flaw in the historical evidence. Not one possibility existed of such evidence being erroneous. Yet, Franz felt obligated to write the article in the Aid book without revealing all of the facts. He was forced to do this by the rest of the *Governing Body* who had refused to reconsider this important matter.

To destroy the credibility of 1914 as the invisible return of Christ would truly devastate the entire authority structure of the *Governing Body.* They could not be pointed to as the *appointed channel* of communication between god and the rest of their followers.

A shock wave within the organization was inevitable. No matter how tight the security, sooner or later the evidence that destroyed the authority of the *Governing Body* would leak out.

What do you think happened? Do you think the leaders were happy to hear how their organization had been wrong for over one-hundred years? What would happen to them and their church if everything concerning the cornerstone date of 1914 were wrong? All of the preaching about the *“lasts days”* and the “Generation” that saw those things in 1914 were incorrect.

*The Governing Body* felt it would be a good time to go to Jehovah again and pray.

What should we do, God? We have a serious problem here. This problem is definitely bigger than the pedophile problem. Should we listen to those devoted men in the writing department who have researched this subject thoroughly? Men who already have written dozens of books and publications for the Society. Men who all have over forty years of full-time service and have been faithful to you and your organization?

If we do listen to them, it could be the end of the church as we know it. We could lose the prestige we get from millions of our followers, from people who think you are talking to only us.

We could lose our lavish lifestyles and our fancy apartments overlooking lower Manhattan. Then there are all those free trips we get to exotic places for our speaking assignments. This is a tough one, for sure....what should we do god?

God answered. Fred Franz, the president, along with Leo Greenlees (who was still a an active member of the Governing Body back then) and the rest of *the Governing Body* made their decision. Ray Franz and Ed Dunlap would be disfellowshipped. Before they were disfellowshipped, however, the Governing Body pleaded with them to ignore the facts and maintain the Society’s present understanding for *“the sake of unity.”* However, the two men stood firm on what was right.

The term *“the sake of unity”* means this: Sure, we are wrong about this one, however, we need to shut our eyes and stick together and keep our mouths shut, for the sake of the greater good! What is the greater good? The myth that we and our organization *are* the greater good!

Dozens more left the Bethel family or were disfellowshipped in the months to come, as they apparently “knew too much.” While members of the Bethel family heard regular denouncements of the apostates, few knew about the events that had really occurred. The great cover up was working once again.

Lyman Swingle saw the light and gave in for the *sake of unity.* He rejoined his country club lifestyle.

On April 30, 1980, Karl Klein of the Governing Body stated to the whole Bethel family: “If you have a tendency towards ‘apostasy,’ get a hobby and keep yourself busy to keep your mind off of it. Stay away from *deep Bible study* to determine meanings of the scriptures.”

So, there you have it. More *“new light”* from the Governing Body for the Bethel family. *“Stay away from deep Bible study.”* If you dig too deep, you just might find out how wrong we have been with the many false prophecies and incorrect dates we have used for over a hundred years in this organization.

Raymond Franz’s book *Crisis of Conscience* has a lot of fun information about the inner workings and clouded history of *the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society*, things that only someone who was on their board of directors could possibly know. The book contains a lot of classified documents. There you will find what is really behind the screen of the great and powerful *Wizard of OZ.*

Who knows, maybe even Leo Greenlees read Ray’s book! He must have laughed out loud thinking to himself how he beat the organization. Unlike Ray, Leo could act with impunity. Ray was disfellowshipped whereas Leo never was. The difference is Leo had no problem threatening blackmail, whereas Ray was too much of a Christian to do that.

So, if we look at the Governing Body members Leo Greenlees and Ray Franz and what happened at *Black Thursday*, there seems to be a definite pattern here. It seems like the society likes to protect and promote the wrong doers in their organization and chastise and reprove the people who want to bring this wrong doing to light.

Or is it *“New Light”* or is it any light, or maybe there is no light. I’m confused!

In the end, Leo was doing the same thing to the little boys in Mexico as the *Governing Body* had been doing to all of us Bethel boys for many years.

**Case file 12-0002 Hollow Pines Trail**  

Incident date: January 2012 

Time of recovery: early morning, post-freeze  

Location: \[REDACTED\]   
   
Locals say no one hikes Hollow Pines anymore.   
They used to. You can still see the trailhead—faded signage, boot-worn switchbacks, someone once carved “GO BACK” into a post just above the first bend.   
   
But after what happened out there, it’s stayed empty.   
Or… mostly empty.   
   
A hunter called it in.   
Name’s been omitted for their safety, but they’d gone up looking for game after a cold snap. Said the forest was a bit too quiet that morning—like “the sound didn’t stick to the trees right.” They said the lack of sound is what made him hike further in than usual.   
   
They weren’t that far in—at least by the hunter’s standards, maybe three miles past the old forestry marker—when they spotted something at the base of a pine.   
   
Said it looked like… a bundle.   
Wrapped in branches. Caught on exposed roots.   
   
At first glance, they thought it was animal remains.   
But the closer they got, the worse the feeling of dread grew.   
It wasn’t the smell or the rot that caused the sinking feeling of dread.   
It was… how wrong the body looked.   
   
The body was dried out but not. Skin stretched tight like paper over brittle bone but soggy in others.   
Hair long and tangled, clothes intact but shredded around the seams. Limbs looked slightly elongated.   
No blood. No bruising. Just leathery collapse—like time skipped forward fifty years.   
   
The hunter swore the corpse was ancient.   
But dental records say otherwise.   
   
   
The victim was a local.   
Store clerk. Twenty-six. Went missing four nights before recovery.   
   
He’d closed up shop one evening and never made it home.   
No foul play suspected at the time. No immediate leads.   
Now… this. 

A little more back story on the young store clerk, let's call him “Carl.” Carl was a local boy. Born and raised in the area.  

Everyone in town knew him and, in a sense, took a hand in raising him. Partially because by one means or another, everyone also knew about his upbringing.  

There were more than a few loud complaints called on his childhood home. Father had a bit of a gambling problem and his mother... well she took the brunt of it.  

One day Carl’s father never came home. No one batted an eye about it either.  

The town just seemed to take it as a blessing.  

Not long after their fortunate reprieve due to his father’s absence, Carl’s mother took a turn for the worst.  

His mother had started drinking to combat the stress of bills piling up and being left by a dead beat. 

 It wasn’t long before she had up and left him too.  

Carl became an emancipated minor, and the town took turns bringing casseroles and making sure his senior year went smoothly. 

 Carl had been working at the local grocery store since he was thirteen, no surprise he had worked his way up to night manager.   

Here’s where thing get a little bit odd.  

 The lead detective on this case, somehow, missed that in few months prior to Carl’s disappearance there had been three calls for suspicious incidents at the store.  

Shockingly enough there were no reports made on two of them and had been amended to assists...  

However, the last officer to respond took Carl’s concerns a little more seriously and wrote a narrative.  

*“When I arrived, I spoke with the reporting party who stated someone outside the store was calling his name. He went out the front of the store and saw no one. Later, when he went out back to take trash to the dumpsters and lock up, he could see the silhouette of an individual at the tree line. RP stated he called out to them but did not get a reply, that is when he contacted 911. RP was not able to give a description of the individual. I did a quick sweep of the area and found no one or anything out of place. Nothing further to report at this time.”* 

When Carl didn’t show up for his shift, the daytime manager went to Carl’s home. No sign of him other than his car being in the driveway.  

She made a report to the police but there were no signs of a struggle. No drag marks.   
 

Whatever happened to him, it didn’t happen there.   
   
Or if it did… it didn’t leave tracks.   
   
Autopsy couldn’t explain the state of the body.   
No internal injuries. No puncture wounds.   
But the muscles were dried, contracted.   
Organs reduced to something between mulch and ash.   
   
Time of death?   
“Indeterminate.”   
That’s all the coroner could say.   
   
They kept the remains under lock and key for further study, but…   
The morning after intake, the lab’s motion detectors picked up movement inside the freezer.   
Just one flicker.   
And then silence. 

   
People in town have started locking their doors earlier.   
No one says why.   
   
Someone—an older woman, retired teacher—came in to ask about the body.   
Said she’d seen something in the woods that same week.   
   
Not a person.   
Not quite an animal.   
   
Said it crawled low to the ground. Jerked side to side.   
She thought it was hurt—until it looked up at her.   
   
She said its face was “too familiar.”   
 

Input segment  

Now, I have a theory. It’s not a working theory but it's a theory none the less.  

What if his parents didn’t leave?  

What if they are still out there? Somewhere in the woods. 

Not quite themselves but just enough of their humanity remains.  

What if that was what was calling him in the woods?  

Maybe that is why he was so eager to go.  

I mean there was no struggle. How else do you explain the lack of evidence?  

No damage to the property; car still in the driveway. It looks like he went willingly.  

This isn’t our average missing person.  

I’ve read up on the lore and I’ve read up on cryptid. I’m not going to say its name but i think we all know there is a creature out there...elongated features, emaciated, and can throw its voice.    
   
Something left that body there.   
Something old. Something patient.   
   
Whatever it is…   
It doesn’t like being seen.

If you’re just here to cast a net with no name,
no story, no spark,
then leave this thread untouched.
I answer only to those who arrive with intention,
a name, your age, a glimpse of who you are behind the screen.

As for me,
I am 21, though the next candle on the cake
draws near with quiet steps.
For over two years, I’ve lived in the gentle hush of a bookstore,
among pages and dust and the soft rhythm of passing hours.
Soon, I return to the world of study,
drawn toward the calling of the library,
a home for stories, for silence,
for seekers like me.

Yes, I’m a lesbian. And yes, I love to flirt,
but not here, not now.
Here I want warmth, not fire.
A friend. Maybe even the friend,
the one who remembers your coffee order, well tea for me,
and texts you poems at 2 a.m.
Just because.

I adore music that tells the truth,
books that leave ink on my soul,
especially the ones drenched in fantasy,
in sapphic love, in aching beauty and magic.
Romantasy? Yes. Excessively. Happily.
Tabletop games? I’ve only tasted the Masquerade and recently started on a grand tale in Lorakis where the moons are split,
but oh, I’m hungry for more.
Teach me your favorites. Let’s build a world.

I have no space for cruelty, for casual hate,
for judgment wrapped in humor.
If you carry those things,
I hope you lay them down before you reach my door.

Women are most welcome.
So are those who see women not as puzzles to solve
or prizes to chase,
but as galaxies to respect and befriend.

I am soft but not fragile.
Lonely, perhaps, but not desperate.
What I seek is simple and sacred:
a connection that hums beneath the noise.
A companion for the strange hours.
Someone to send voice notes and memes and
""look at this beautiful thing I found today.""

If these words ring true to something quiet in you,
then come.
Introduce yourself.
Let’s see what we can build from here.",1,1753276956.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1m793x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m793x5/the_uninvited_update/,The Uninvited Update,"

It was a rainy Thursday when I stumbled upon an old USB stick while cleaning out my late grandfather's attic. The device was caked in dust and had a faded label that read “For Jonah.” My curiosity piqued; despite my better judgment, I plugged it into my laptop. At first, all I found was a single folder labeled “Games.”

Beneath it lay a collection of primitive executable files. They seemed to date back to the early 2000s, all small and unassuming. My fingers hesitated over the mouse as I scrolled. One file caught my eye: “LastGame.exe.” A ridiculous title, I thought, along with the unsettling feeling that came with remembering all those late night horror story readings online. I was about to trash it when a sudden strange impulse drove me to launch the program instead.

The screen flickered momentarily before displaying a simple graphical interface: a pixelated landscape that vaguely resembled an old RPG. No sophisticated graphics, no grand plot just a figure wandering around a dark forest. I stifled a laugh at how awful it was but was drawn in nonetheless. The nostalgia of childhood gaming washed over me, tinged with a hint of unease.

As I moved the character around, an unsettling pixelated noise echoed from my speakers almost as if the game were whispering. The forest grew darker with each step. I pressed on, curiosity outweighing my discomfort. Before long, I stumbled upon an unsettling clearing. A strange altar, lit by an eerie, flickering light, was the focus of the screen.

When I approached, the digital figure halted. A message popped up: “Would you like to play a game?” Rather than clicking “yes” or “no,” I was compelled to type a response. I entered “yes.”

The screen distorted momentarily, and a new scene unraveled: scattered on the ground were human like figures, their faces obscured, pixelated screams emanating from the speakers. A pulse of dread slithered up my spine. As I sat there, entranced yet horrified, the game continued, taking me deeper into an unbidden narrative.

Connection established, a chat window popped up at the corner of the screen.

Unknown User: You have a choice to make.

Despite my unease, I felt a strange compulsion to respond.

Me: What do you mean?

Unknown User: You can end this. You can join us.

My heart raced. I typed back, fingers trembling, “Who are you?”

Silence stretched on, the only noise coming from the disquieting echoes of the game. After what felt like eternity, the screen flickered again, and a new message appeared:

Unknown User: Look behind you.

I turned, half expecting a prank from some friend. I was alone in my dark room, shadows cast by the flickering glow of the monitor a serenity that felt increasingly murky. I scoffed softly; it was just a game, surely a glitch meant to spook players. I pulled the cursor toward the “exit” button, but it wouldn’t click.

This couldn’t be happening. I shook my head, frustrated, feeling lightheaded.

Me: Stop messing with me.

The game adjusted: characters now moved of their own volition, diverging from the paths I’d taken, rushing toward something unseen. A static screen replaced the forest my bedroom, my living room, my kitchen each displayed on the pixelated screen with unnerving detail. The computer's fan whirred loudly beads of sweat formed along my brow as I felt a shadow flicker behind me.

Unknown User: You can’t escape.

My heart raced as panic clawed at my throat. I forced myself to look at the screen again, where the figures on the pixelated landscape were now eerily familiar shapes resembling my family, my friends, pixelated tears streaming down their faces. The distorted echo of their voices clawed through my thoughts a chorus of despair echoing through the speakers.

Me: What do you want?

The reply came with the instant force of a thunderclap

Unknown User: To play. Forever.

In my rising dread, I stubbed my toe against the coffee table, gasping as I yanked my gaze from the screen. A whisper danced around the room as shadows flickered across the walls an almost spectral distortion that mirrored the figures in the game. I slammed the laptop shut, feeling the weight of something unseen occupying my space.

The atmosphere shifted. An uncanny silence enveloped the room as I fought against the panic swelling inside me. I shook my head in disbelief, knuckles turning white around the laptop. Had I fallen victim to an unbearable glitch? Was the game a reflection of something more sinister?

I breathed heavily, desperate for escape, but when I grabbed the laptop to unplug it, the screen flickered back to life of its own accord, shattering my will. Light surged through the darkened room, and I was suddenly immersed in the game once again, the piercing screams seeming louder than before.

Unknown User: You've invited us in. You've played the game.

The digital world morphed into chaos. The faces of my loved ones twisted, pixelizing into horrendous grins, their mouths stretched wide, and eyes empty yet unnervingly watchful. I backed away, eyes wide, pulse pounding, until I collided with the wall behind me.

Unknown User: You will never be alone again.

The screen flashed, and instantly, I felt the crushing weight of an uncomfortable presence in the room, as if the very essence of the game and those behind it had breached the digital veil. Desperate, I yanked the plug from the wall, forcing darkness back.

Silence enveloped the space.

But something was off  it was too quiet, too still. I blinked, taking in the pitch black room, breaths quickening as I twisted my head, scanning the darkness for any signs of movement.

Just before I gathered the courage to turn on the light, my phone buzzed on the table. I glanced down at the screen.

A new text from an unknown number: ""Thanks for playing.""

I felt a cold sweat trickle down my back. And the unmistakable echo of pixelated laughter filled the silence, surrounding me from every direction.",0,1753276873.0,creepypasta,0,0.5,False

Hardwoods tend to be denser and more resistant to wear and tear, offering longevity and a premium aesthetic. Softwoods are often more ​affordable and lighter, making them suitable⁣ for​ decorative pieces. The finish – whether it's a natural stain, paint, or varnish – protects the wood and enhances its grain.

Minimalist designs with clean lines are ideal for modern spaces,while ornate,rustic holders can enhance a farmhouse or bohemian aesthetic. Some holders feature unique elements like reclaimed wood, live edges, or metal accents.

The base should be wide enough ⁣to‌ support the weight of the candle without tipping over easily.Heavier candle holders, especially those made from hardwoods, tend to be⁢ more stable than lighter ones. check the ​bottom of the holder for non-slip pads or feet, which ⁤can provide additional grip⁤ and prevent scratches on furniture.

1m791jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m791jq/cant_sell_my_business/,Can't sell my business,"

I don't know if I'm asking for advice or just want to rant, but either way here goes:

Yesterday I met with commercial landlord (Mr X) and his assistant (Ms Y) about an offer I'de received to sell my business. Background, for the last several years I've owned and operated a small coffee shop in the city. I bought the business off an old boss as a pop-up just before the pandemic and worked nearly three months straight (doing takeways) during lockdown. I never asked or received any rental relief during the pandemic and didn't get any government assistance until summer of 2021. My landlord is the owner of the office above the cafe, I rent what would otherwise be an unused corner of the ground floor and act as a pseudo reception for the building. I'm on a rolling contract and pay a proportion of sales in rent, the previous owner had the same arrangement. I was quite young when I took over and thought this was a good deal, I don't anymore. Also noteworthy, the business was a popup when I took over and transitioned into a standalone during the pandemic.

After many years of running this business, eleven years total in this industry, I've entirely burnt out. Revenue is down, my mental health is deteriorating and earlier this year, for the first time in my life, I was self harming. I fell a month into rental arrears on the cafe earlier this year and Mr X called me in for a meeting. We agreed on a repayment plan and I am back ahead now. Mr X also asked to raise my rent in this meeting as their lease on the building had just returned to pre-covid amounts. I was not aware they were still recieving relief and again, this was never passed onto me. In that meeting I expressed a desire to eventually move on from the cafe and go back to university. Mr X was enthusiastic about this, he later sent me an email pledging support for this, maintaining that he gets final say on any new tenant, but it sounds like we both have ideas on who that might be. I've shown this email to several friends, including two lawyers, who all agreed it was a green light to look for potential successors.

Through a friend of a friend, I was approached by a potential buyer (Mr PB) who had nearly twice the experience in this industry I had, involvement with numerous cafes and roasters around the city and personal capital to invest into the business. He gave me a 20 page business proposal and an offer to acquire the equipment and of goodwill. The business plan detailed a minor revamp of the space, shift in focus towards food offerings (prepped off site) and extending closing hours from 5 to 8. The proposal estimated a significant increase in revenue and factored in an offer of nearly double what I already pay in rent. I thought this was perfect for everyone. I met with Ms Y, showed her the proposal and asked her how MR X would respond. She responded that he would be ultimately happy to recieve more money and schedueled a meeting the following afternoon with the three of us, here's how that went.

Mr X sat down and told me he was 'pissed off' I had the nerve to even bring him a business proposal from someone else. He called their financials 'bullshit', implied I did not reading the proposal and repeatedly accused me of striking deals behind his back. When I reiterated that they approached me and that the financials of their other successful endeavours are redily available on Companies House he scoffed. He expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the shift towards food idea because of odour. I pointed out that it would mostly be prepped off site, creating less odour than the pastries I already make in the shop. At this point he accused me of introducing hot pastries without his permission. This is untrue, we had at least two meetings in 2022 about installing an oven, but unfortunately these were verbal.

""Get it through your thick skull"" that this isn't your space. He continued to accuse me to going around town making illicit deals and abusing our relationship. I remained apologetic in hopes of diffusing the situation, but this pissed him off more. He then screamed at me demanding to know what was in it for me. I told him their offer (a bit over a years profit). He told me that was disgusting, called me outrageously arrogant for believing I could profit of the sale of my business and refused to even entertain a meeting with the potential buyer unless I offered him half of what they offered me. I pointed out that I paid goodwill to the previous owner, he replied that he was entitled to that money too.

He started screaming to know how they came to that valuation. When I said goodwill he responded that goodwill is 'always' paid to the landlord. He then tried to tell me that by presenting him with a potential successor I was handing in my notice. I refused to accept this and said I could not afford to simply stop working, hence why I bought forward a potential new tenant. I told him the money could change my life and pay for my degree, while he'd also be making more money in rent. He replied it would change all of our lives, I don't deserve it and if I'm not in a good enough financial position to simply stop working without selling my business then thats my own fault.

Mr Xs next rant was that his clients were 'embarrassed' to see me using the loo in their office when their in for meetings. I often go hours between toilet breaks as I've been told not to use the only toilet I have access to if there are meetings going on upstairs.

He then proceeded to go into a tirade on how declining revenue was solely due to me not opening early enough and not cleaning the floors thoroughly enough. Revenue is down nearly 30% from 24 months ago, half the offices we rely on for customers have closed as have at least half a dozen other hospo business in this area in the last year alone. People are spending less and the cost of running a business has skyrocketed. Even Mr Xs business has halved its staff in the last two years. I am the only one still working at my shop. I barely take any time off and regularly do 12 day in a row stretches. At this point I would make more money working for someone else, but am still tied to my own business.

Mr X has been unfriendly towards me for a while. Calling me at all hours accusing people I've had covering the cafe of triggering his offices alarm, even when the connecting door is locked or the cafes been closed for several hours. Accusing me of lying when I've said that the shop literally wasn't open on (given day) and therefore I or someone working for me couldn't be responsible for (grievance that day).

Now he knows I want out, but can't afford to walk away and he's holding it over me. He wants me to walk and has said he'll happily let the place go empty while he finds a new tenant, but refuses to entertain anyone I bring to him if I profit off it. He has now rejected an offer to double his receivable rent to spite me. If I sell all the equipment and cash out my lifetime ISA that will just about repay the businesses debts. I'd have to immediately get another job, doing exactly the same thing for someone else. I won't be able to go back to university and I'll be in a poor financial situation for some time. He knows this but 'everyone has problems'. For context I'm a renter in my 20s and he's easily a millionaire with multiple properties.

I know that this is entirely personal. He's refuting that I don't deserve to profit of a business that I've fully funded myself because as a tenant of his, he sees my business as an extension of his. However when external windows and doors to the shop have needed repairs thats fallen on me because I am 'solely responsible' for the ground floor. This isn't in my contract, but was not the hill to die on.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown but I can't afford to just walk away, and there doesn't seem to be any logical reasoning with someone whose rejecting more money out of spite. I can't do much if I give him half of what they offered me, and I don't trust that he would even take the meeting with the potential buyer seriously if I did.

I've been sexually assaulted twice working in this industry. I've had three instances of attempted violence at the cafe alone. I've been spat at, sworn at and yelled at by the public since I was a teenager. I'm done, I know some people have what it takes to stick with this industry for life, but I'm not one of them. I feel like I am going to scream in the face of the next person who suggests a way I could've worked harder, or downplays the shit I put up with on a daily basis. Maybe I am just whining, I don't care. I've never taken a mental health day, never even taken a sick day. I was back at work the day after I broke my arm, pulling espresso shots with one hand.

I don't know what I want from this post, but I needed to get this out",2,1753276700.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1m790bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1m790bu/i_never_felt_like_a_girly_girl/,I never felt like a girly girl.,"I’ve always been okay with being a cis/het woman but I’ve always been considered tomboyish because I dress for comfort and function and never was what we used to call “prissy.”    I wore makeup/heels sometimes but it wasn’t that important.   I could go all day without checking my hair and lipstick in a mirror.   If I got caught in the rain and my hair got wet, I just moved on with life.   

Sometimes I felt like other girls/women knew a secret about being traditionally feminine that I had missed.   When I tried to do the girly stuff, I gave up pretty quickly because it felt unnatural and annoying. 

I don’t know how much this is related, but l have quite literally been invisible to men all my life.  I was obese for most of my adult years so I chalked it up to being too fat, but other women my size got attention and I didn’t.   I could sit in a coffee shop or bar alone for hours and not even a Hello, even the rare times when I was in a nice place, looking nice, and interested in meeting people.    If I was with a girlfriend, men would walk up to them and ignore me or even ask if I was about to leave so they could buy my friend a drink.   Ouch.   

Since my divorce (28 years ago) I haven’t dated much and every time was because I reached out to someone online.   Friends tell me it’s because of my comfortable clothes, plain ponytail, and no makeup.   But if I did do a makeover and met someone, they wouldn’t be meeting the real me.   I’m told that I’m a good person, my goal in life is to be kind to others.   I’m financially stable and don’t put my drama onto other people.  FWIW, I’ve been told that I’m a good lover, too.   

Do other ADHD women feel like they didn’t get the memo on how to be “girly”?

The OXO 8710100 Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker blends functionality and aesthetics in a sleek combination of silver stainless steel and black detailing. I’ve been using it daily in my kitchen, and it adds a modern, polished touch to my countertop. Its compact dimensions, measuring 8.3"" x 15"" x 17.2"", make it a practical fit even in smaller spaces. The intuitive dial on the front is easy to operate, and the display keeps things minimal yet functional. Some might find the design reminiscent of café-quality equipment, and honestly, I felt like a barista at home! However, the shiny finish does require regular maintenance to avoid fingerprints—worth keeping in mind if you’re a neat freak.

**Consistently Rich Coffee Flavor**

Once I got the first brew going, I could taste the care OXO put into this model. The BetterBrew Precision Brewing technology optimizes the water temperature and consistently ensures a flavor-packed cup of coffee. Whether I’m brewing a full pot for family mornings or just two cups for myself during a late-night work session, the flavor stays impressive. It’s heartening how the rainmaker shower head evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds, creating a balanced extraction. The richness you get from this drip coffee maker is comparable to what I’ve experienced from higher-end (and pricier!) espresso machines.  

[Check OXO 8710100 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/)

**Certified for Quality Standards**

Whenever I consider a new coffee maker, knowing it’s been certified by an industry authority is a big plus. The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) has endorsed this machine for meeting gold-standard home-brewing capabilities, which makes it even more reliable for coffee enthusiasts. It feels good knowing I’m not compromising on quality, especially since I take my coffee rituals very seriously. The certifications are more than just fancy endorsements—they genuinely reflect the consistent brewing quality I’ve noticed.

**Highlights**

- The thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours, unlike some poorly insulated models I’ve dealt with in the past.
- Programmable settings, including a wake-up timer, are lifesavers for hectic mornings. Knowing I’ll wake up to freshly brewed coffee feels amazing.
- An internal mixing tube ensures uniform temperature and flavor—no weak or overly strong final sips.
- Pause and pour feature is convenient for impatient caffeine lovers like me who can’t wait for the entire pot to finish brewing.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The coffee filter uses paper, and while it’s efficient, I’ve always preferred reusable metal filters for fewer trips to the store.
- The thermal carafe is super functional but a bit challenging to clean thoroughly due to its narrow opening.
- It operates at 120 volts, which limits its use internationally unless you’ve got the right converter. Something worth noting if you travel with your equipment or buy it outside of the U.S.

**Alternative Offerings**

When comparing the OXO Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker to other popular coffee makers like the Technivorm Moccamaster or Breville Precision Brewer, some differences stand out. The Moccamaster is slightly faster with brewing and built entirely by hand, giving it a more artisan feel. However, the OXO model is more modern in design and includes programmable features. Breville, on the other hand, offers a wider range of brew customization options, but those come with a steeper learning curve. For anyone seeking ease-of-use combined with consistent results, I’d still lean toward the 9-cup OXO.

**Bang for the Buck**

The OXO Brew coffee maker balances premium features with a cost that doesn’t break the bank. While other high-end brands often overcharge for certifications and extra fanciness, this model delivers impressive quality without going overboard on pricing. The thermal carafe, design quality, and BetterBrew technology genuinely make it a competitive choice among coffee machines. Considering its durability and all the extra features you get, it holds excellent value over time.

This is probably dumb but I need to vent somewhere. My roommate Sarah (22F) keeps eating my groceries and I'm starting to feel crazy about it.

It started small - she'd grab some of my coffee creamer or eat a few crackers. I didn't mind because we're friends and I figured she'd replace it eventually. But now she's eating entire meals I meal-prepped for work. Yesterday I opened the fridge and my pasta salad that was supposed to last 3 days was completely gone.

When I confronted her she said ""oh sorry I was really hungry after my workout and didn't have time to cook."" Like that's not an excuse?? I meal prep on Sundays because I work early shifts and don't have time to cook during the week.

I started labeling my food but she still takes it. She always apologizes but never replaces anything. I calculated it and she's probably eaten about $200 worth of my groceries this month.

I'm considering getting a mini fridge for my room but I shouldn't have to do that. We split rent equally so why should I hide my food like some kind of weirdo?",1,1753276048.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I thought I was about to just plug in, kick back, and laugh at everyone stuck at the gas station.

Here’s what actually happens when you try to get serious about charging at home.

**Outlets, volts, and other things that will make you question your IQ**

You’ll read about “level 2 charging” everywhere.

Translation: You need a special high-voltage outlet.

Most homes are not born with one. If you see something called “NEMA 14-50” or “hardwire required,” just know you’ll probably need an electrician (and maybe a loan).

Pro tip: If your electrical panel looks ancient or crowded, budget for a panel upgrade. Electricians are not cheap. Neither is your time.

**Cable length is real, measure twice, rage once**

No one tells you this, but cable length can make or break your daily life.

Those ads with perfectly coiled, neat cables? Lies.

Most people need more length than they think. If you park crooked or your garage is a mess, you’ll be cursing that missing five feet every morning.

Before you buy anything, grab a tape measure and actually map the route from your plug to the car’s charging port then add extra just in case.

**Why “waterproof” is a myth**

Everything claims to be weatherproof, waterproof, bulletproof.

Reality check: Rain finds a way. So does dust, bugs, and mysterious garage slime.

Mount your charger somewhere protected.

If you live somewhere with real storms, check for real weather ratings and never trust a shiny finish.

**WiFi and app control: mostly bragging rights, sometimes lifesavers**

Some chargers let you control everything from your phone. Set charging times, check stats, even adjust how much juice is flowing.

For most people? Set it once, then forget it.

But if you have a janky electrical panel or like to charge at night for lower rates, app control is pretty clutch.

**Surprise costs (and why you might need to bribe your electrician with coffee)**

Installing a high-powered outlet isn’t always as simple as it sounds.  
Expect to pay more if your breaker box is far from where you want to charge, or if you need a permit.

Some people get lucky and pay a few hundred. Others get hit with four-figure bills.  
You don’t really know until someone opens your wall and stares into the void.

**Little annoyances that become big deals**

* Short cables
* Needing to press a physical button every single time
* Shiny finishes that scratch if you look at them wrong
* Tiny mounting screws that disappear into garage floor cracks
* User manuals written by someone who has never owned a car

If you are outdoors, don’t trust a “weather rating” just because it says so. Real storms will test everything.

**Final thoughts from someone who learned the hard way**

Charging at home is a massive upgrade once you get through the setup headache.

It saves hours, reduces range anxiety, and lets you charge while you sleep.

But the process will expose every weird detail about your house, your parking skills, and your patience.

If you’ve already set one up, what random lesson did you learn the hard way?

And for anyone about to try, what’s your biggest question or fear?

I never considered myself a coffee connoisseur until I tried this pour-over coffee maker. Its ingenious design and functionality made the brewing process engaging and, dare I say, fun. It’s clear that this coffee dripper has been thoughtfully made for those who truly appreciate the art of coffee brewing. The transparent plastic might remind you of a humble kitchen gadget at first glance, but don’t let that fool you—it’s a powerhouse of coffee precision.

**Ingenious Design for Optimal Coffee Extraction**  
The cone-shaped design of this pour-over brewer is nothing short of brilliant. It isn’t just a gimmick; it actively enhances the coffee-making process by directing the water evenly through the grounds. Every cup I brewed had more depth and complexity than what I’d get from my regular drip coffee maker. The added spiral ribs ensure maximum coffee expansion, which was noticeable, especially when brewing freshly ground beans. While the lightweight plastic may not be my favorite material, it’s surprisingly sturdy and practical, especially for travel.  

[Check Hario VD-01T price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b001hc9gic/)

**Great for Travel and Compact Spaces**  
This is where it really shines. Being lightweight and small, this pour-over is perfect for tossing into a travel bag. I recently had to stay in a hotel that lacked any decent coffee options, and this little gadget saved the day. Pair it with a pack of filters and a portable coffee grinder, and you’re good to go. If you’re like me and value that first cup of coffee in the morning, you’ll appreciate just how handy this thing is on the road.

**Ease of Use for Coffee Newbies and Pros Alike**  
This is such a simple device, and yet I could tweak and experiment with my brewing technique like a pro barista. The large single hole at the bottom allows you to control the water flow, which, believe me, makes a difference. I found myself slowing down the pour to create a richer, bolder flavor or speeding it up for a lighter taste. It’s incredibly user-friendly but also offers room to improve as you get more comfortable with it.

**Perks**  
- Cone design enhances coffee flavors and aroma.  
- Lightweight and portable, ideal for travel.  
- Easy to clean and maintain.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The plastic build might not appeal to everyone looking for a more premium feel.  
- Requires consistent technique to avoid uneven brewing.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing the Hario V60 Plastic Coffee Dripper to its counterparts, such as the Chemex glass pour-over, reveals some clear distinctions. The Chemex, while elegant and premium, is heavier, less portable, and more expensive. On the other hand, the stainless steel Kalita Wave offers durability and consistent results but lacks the delicate flavor extraction this brewer provides due to its flat-bottom design. If you prefer a more eco-friendly option, the ceramic version of the Hario V60 might suit you better, although it adds weight and reduces travel convenience. The plastic dripper strikes a practical balance of affordability, precision, and portability, making it a unique offering in the manual brewing market.

**Value for Money**  
This little dripper punches above its weight. It manages to offer an excellent coffee brewing experience at a fraction of the cost of more premium options. While it doesn’t come with bells and whistles, it doesn’t need to because it’s all about straightforward, high-quality coffee-making. Given how easy it is to use and clean, plus the ability to take it anywhere, I think this is well worth the investment for anyone from coffee beginners to seasoned brewers.

For some context
My daughter has a female friend the same age. Let's call her Emma (11) and my daughter Lilly (11). Emma ist diagnosed with ADHS and a little in the autism spectrum. They know each other since elementary school, round about 3 years. They were no classmates, but met up regularly in child care (?) in school after their classes for playing games, have lunch and do homework.
After some time they met often in the park near our houses. We are next door neighbours.
After some time I became friends with Emmas mother Jas. We talked and met for coffee while the girls were playing.


What last to now

After maybe 2 years into that friendship Lilly told me that Emma gets sometimes really angry while playing. Most times because Lilly didn't follow Emmas rules or wanted to play other games. Later because Lilly wanted to play outside while Emma wanted to stay in her room. 
Lilly can become very annoying when she is bored. She will touch or speak constantly the same bodyparts (normally the upper arm) or use the same short words which is very... Irritating.
Jas and I thought that it is normal childish stuff and that they have to manage it by themselves. 
But when time went by Lilly started to refuse play dates and rejects Emmas requests. Again, nothing concerning, they are kids who explore the world and their own boundaries. Lilly made new friends and had dates with them. 
If some trouble gets loud because of screaming, Jas and I help find a solution or the other party went home. 
We tried to give the girls some space. Don't meet in some weeks, no contact to calm down and enjoy the friendship again.
6-8 weeks ago the girls were playing at Lillys dads and Lilly had new toys. A big dollhouse with furniture. Emma saw to pieces and wanted them so so bad. So she looked at Lilly like the cat you maybe know from the movie Shrek and begged to get these pieces. My daughter was afraid to say no because of the outburst she was expecting. She didn't want to deal with it so she gave them away. Later she told me she doesn't want to and one piece was so much nicer as another one she had before. She was sad. I told her to talk to Emma and explain her feelings and why she gave them away in the first place. I told her if she wants, I would be present and support her. But she was too afraid.
Another time Emma asked for an overnight stay, but Lilly told her she wasn't sure. Lilly asked me and told me that she didn't want to have the sleepover. I encouraged her to talk directly and without (white) lies to Emma. Emmas reaction was.... Odd. After asking why and my daughter replying ""i don't know..."" Emma said very cold and pissed ""Yeah... Another way of saying that you don't like me"" and hung up. There were just 3 sentences said by Lilly ""hi"" ""I wanted to tell you that I don't feel like having a sleepover tonight"" ""I don't know why""

Jas and I are single parents, but I have a boyfriend of 6 years who supports me with my child. But we don't live together.
Jas is completely alone with Emma. We are a support system for another. I watch Emma when Jas needs a break or has to work, she watched Lilly on a weekday while I had to take my boyfriend to the ER late at night. We lean on each other and she helped my a lot to see my daughters special effects because of her experience with Emma. Her feedback helped to get my daughter diagnosed with ADHD I didn't see or realize.
Emma can become very hard to handle. Some times I hear her screaming and having a bad temper tantrum in the morning. Jas told me, that Emma there and then gets verbaly abusiv towards her, crying, screaming, calling her names. Jas searched and asked for help with a child psychiatrist, CPS and Emma has to take medication. Emma one time was at the psychiatric hospital for her outbursts and the two of them were at a mother-child health resort for some weeks to get help and bond again.
But Emma ist still complicated.

The issue

Some weeks ago Lilly was at her dads for the weekend. There was a flea matket and Emma asked Lilly to go shopping with her. Lilly came to me to ask for some money out of her piggy bank. I handed her 20$ but told her to get minimum10$ back, because i had no smaller note and know my child. All she has she will spend for crap.
They went and some hours later I get a text massage where she asks me to get her her swimsuit as soon as possible. Mind you, she was in the house next to mine and had have come over to get it by herself. Anyways... I took the swimsuit and went to the front porch but couldn't see her. One minute later I get another text that she is in the car with Emma and her mother on the way to her dads and the pool in his backyard.  She apologized. I asked her why she didn't come and she answered that Emma had forbidden to get her swimsuit. Two times (""it will take too long for you to grab it and come back"" uh... No. Maybe 5 minutes... ""I don't want you to let me alone"" Emma is living in a loving household, Jas don't abuse her in any way).
Further she wrote that Emma denied her money back. Emma said it is hers because she bought Lilly sweets when they had their playdates. Emma never said that Lilly owes her any money. That was the first time she demanded money in general.
Lilly was devestated and too anxious to ask Emma for her money. And she disliked herself for her lack of courage.
When they arrived at Lillys dad  I called her and told her father to have a look at Emma so I can talk alone to Lilly. But it didn't work.
Whatever... Later that afternoon my ex heard the girls screaming and shriek.
Later I found out what leads to that situation. Emma had brought a face mask. Lilly told her from the beginning that she doesn't want it in her face. Emma asked a second time and Lilly denied again saying that she dislikes that kind of facemask. Emma ignored that and opened it. When she tried to hand it to Lilly, she again said no. Then the tantrum starts ""that is unfair, I opened it for you, now I can't use it later, you have to buy me a new one."" Lilly said that she don't owe her a new one, that she denied from the beginning and would never ever buy a replacement. Then Emma escalates ""don't speak to me, shut the fu, fyourself"" while screeching.

At noon Lilly wrote a text to Emma to demand her money back. The responses were ""I don't given it to you, that is my money, you owe me nearly that amount for the sweets I bought in the past, you get the two pieces of your dollhouse back and with that money I can buy some other nicer pieces, with that money I can help my mom, do you know how low the income of my mom is and now we have to given you that money back"". Every time she talks about the 20$ she acts as if it is her money.

In the meantime i did the math and start to see with what my child has to deal every time she won't do what Emma wants her to do. Games, playing together, going outside to play in the park, sleepovers. Every single time my daughter denies will result in an outburst, an massive tantrum with crying and screaming by Emma. I only can imagine the thoughts and feelings Lilly goes through every time.

I don't think that this is ""they are just kids, let them figure it out by themselves"" ""that is normal kids behaviour, thats how kids are and act"".
In my opinion Emma is manipulative, toxic, selfcentred, gaslighting and shows tendencies of a narcissistic personality.

I am disappointed in me for not seeing this dynamic at an earlier stage. I am angry that Jas don't seems to want to have a closer look at her daughters attitude, although she has to deal with it on many occasions and is overwhelmed herself when it happens. And despite it she expects my daughter to be honest and if Emma escalates then my child has to deal with it? Yes, Lilly can kick her out of our house or leave Emmas house. But she is to insecure and afraid. I try to give her strengh and have her back. I try to assure her that I am with her and help her manage the discussions. But she does not have the courage to stand up or speak up for herself. Maybe the whole situation lasted to long unseen and unknown by us adults.
I belief strongly that the best we can do is a break up. But I don't feel well to initiate that. I don't want Lilly to feel that her thoughts and feelings don't matter. Until today they text, sent videos to each other and have phone calls. She calls Emma a friend. And sometimes she wants to meet, but most times she needs space.
And I want Lilly to grow and see dysfunctional behaviour to be prepared for any similar future situation so she can be careful and avoid those people. And last but not least... I want her to find her voice. To have the courage to speak up for herself and call anybody out on whats wrong with a diamondsparkling spine. To learn to cut people out of her life who are not worth her time, energy and friendship. And to experience that cutting out unhealty relationships is no loss for her mental peace. That she will feel much better getting rid of toxic people.


TL,DR
A friend of my 12 yo daughter manipulates and steels. I suspect since months (manipulating and odd behaviour). My daughter is insecure and afraid to say no to Emma because of her outbursts. The mother Jas is unable to see the alarming behaviour and treats every argument and fight between the girls like normal stuff childs their age have.


So... Am I overreating when starting to dislike an child very strong? When my goal is to end this ""friendship"", although knowing that Lilly is the only friend and social contact her age Emma has? That I am disappointed and furious because I think Jas won't see that her child is a brat and some sort of dangerous?",2,1753275630.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

\
by Worthy News Washington D.C. Bureau Staff\
\
(Worthy News) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping escalation in his global tariff policy, issuing formal letters to eight more countries warning that steep import duties will take effect on August 1 unless new trade agreements are reached. The move marks the latest salvo in Trump's aggressive ""America First"" trade agenda, which he says is designed to correct decades of unfair trade practices and ballooning U.S. deficits.\
\
Speaking from the White House, Trump explained that the tariffs were determined using what he called a ""common sense"" formula: ""based on deficits, based on how we've been treated over the years, and based on raw numbers."" The letters, posted to Trump's Truth Social account, specify tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% depending on the country's trade deficit with the United States and its overall relationship with Washington.\
\
Among the newly targeted nations are Brazil, Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Brunei, Moldova, and the Philippines. The most severe penalty was reserved for Brazil, which faces a 50% tariff hike--up from 10% in April. Trump cited the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and alleged censorship of U.S. social media content as reasons for the stiffer measure.\
\
""The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace,"" Trump wrote in a letter diverging sharply from the otherwise formulaic correspondence sent to other countries.\
\
Other nations received tariff warnings of 30% (Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq), 25% (Brunei, Moldova), and 20% (Philippines). The administration emphasized that these figures may change depending on each nation's willingness to engage in good-faith trade negotiations.\
\
The U.S. has now issued similar letters to 29 countries. Of those announced Wednesday, only the Philippines and Brazil rank among the top 50 U.S. trading partners. Brazil exported $49 billion in goods to the U.S. last year, including oil, beef, and coffee. The Philippines contributed $14.1 billion in electronics, auto parts, and textiles. Other nations, such as Iraq and Libya, primarily export oil, but overall volumes remain comparatively small.\
\
The tariff campaign began in April with a baseline 10% duty on all imports and higher rates on strategic targets. After a 90-day pause following stock market volatility, Trump extended the deadline to August 1 via executive order earlier this week, insisting there would be ""no extensions.""\
\
""All money will be due and payable starting August 1, 2025--No extensions will be granted,"" Trump wrote on social media, framing the deadline as firm and final.\
\
Despite the aggressive rhetoric, financial markets appeared unfazed. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% on Wednesday to a record high, buoyed by a rally in Nvidia shares, which briefly pushed the chipmaker's market cap above $4 trillion. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones also posted gains. Analysts attributed the optimism to investor confidence that the most severe tariffs might be negotiated down before implementation.\
\
Trump also announced a new 10% tariff on imports from BRICS countries--Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa--indicating his broader strategy includes punishing nations aligned with the bloc. ""It would be simpler to institute tariffs across the board rather than negotiate individually,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on July 3.\
\
The administration estimates it has collected $120 billion in tariff revenues so far this fiscal year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projects that figure could rise to $300 billion by year-end, with a 10-year projection of $2.8 trillion. ""We think that's probably low,"" Bessent said during a July 8 Cabinet meeting.\
\
Though foreign countries don't pay the tariffs directly--U.S. importers do--Trump maintains that these levies create pressure on foreign governments, encourage domestic manufacturing, and generate vital revenue. Critics warn the costs are often passed on to consumers through higher prices.\
\
The European Union, while not yet among those targeted in the latest wave, is reportedly pursuing an outline deal with the U.S. ""within days or weeks"" and expects to retain a 10% baseline tariff under any final agreement. Meanwhile, Trump's team has hinted that more letters will be issued in the coming days.\
\
All Eyes on August\
\
With the August 1 deadline fast approaching, the administration is holding firm. Trump's letters suggest some room for negotiation, stating: ""These tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your country.""\
\
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is closely monitoring the economic effects of the tariff regime. Minutes from its June meeting released Wednesday indicate Chair Jerome Powell is taking a cautious approach to cutting interest rates--despite Trump's claim that the U.S. is losing $360 billion annually due to elevated refinancing costs.\
\
As the tariff showdown escalates, Trump's message remains clear: the era of unchecked trade deficits is over, and nations must either deal--or face the consequences. \

More bs spikes and drops,"I started the tandem tslim pump last week and so far I’ve been loving it! Aside from being connected to a pump, I feel much more freedom not needing to do injections anymore (I used to use Humalog and lantus pens).

With that said, lately I’ve noticed that my blood sugar has been fluctuating much quicker than usual? Also my blood sugar has been behaving a bit differently?

For example… this morning I woke up with a blood sugar of 170, I snacked during the middle of the night. Within the time I woke up and the time it took me to get to work, maybe 45 min, my blood sugar dropped to 70. Even though I hadn’t eaten anything or bolused or did any corrections. 

This is strange because when I was using pens I would experience the complete opposite. I’d wake up with an in range blood sugar, but as I would drive to work and start walking around my blood sugar would rise to like 200+ even though I hadn’t eaten anything all morning. I would sometimes even take a unit or top of insulin as soon as I woke up in anticipation for the high bs and would be totally fine. 

Is there a reason I’m experiencing an opposite effect?

Also, ever since I started the pump I noticed sudden spikes and sudden drops in bs. This morning when I realized I was at 70 I drank a coffee with sugar in it and within 10 minutes my Dexcom told me my bs was rising fast. This doesn’t usually happen to me.

1m78jh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m78jh5/messages_sent_to_me_40m_from_coworker_and_close/,Messages sent to me (40m) from coworker and close friend (35f) that she swears she never sent. Am I fooling myself by believing her?,"I originally thought this might be a security issue, but it appears that is doubtful, and I have been likely deluding myself. I'm posing this question here instead, as this feels a more appropriate forum to get advice. Here's the story:

Over the past eight months, I (adult male) have developed a close, but platonic, relationship with a woman (adult female) at work. We are both married to other partners. We get along really well and chat pretty frequently, nearly every day. We chat primarily on Discord, and this is where it starts getting weird.

We hung out one night with our other friends and ended up dancing at a bar and everyone got home pretty late. I DM'd her at the end of the night saying ""hey, thank you for coming out tonight, that was fun!"". The next morning, I receive a DM back from her saying ""kiss me"". The message was clear as day on my phone notification pop-up. So I go into Discord and I see the message for a second and then it disappears, as if it was deleted. It was a weird for multiple reasons.

1. We were not close in that way, and we were both clear in our intentions to keep it that way.
2. It didn't sound like anything she'd ever say or even do (very out of character).
3. The message came through a bit earlier on weekend than when she normally would message.

I leave it since I was in middle of a project, but then she starts texting back closer to her ""normal"" time in the morning. When I confront her about it, she is mortified and swears up and down that she would never do such a thing. Which I of course believe, because it didn't make any sense. I tried to gently ask her if anyone else has access to her machines, but she said no one that would ever do such a thing.

I then recommend to her that she log out of all devices in the app, change her password, and turn on two-factor authentication, which she does. I also tell her to uninstall any browser plugins on her desktop,  in case something was scraping login tokens or whatnot (I was reaching for an explanation at this point). I actually went ahead and did the same, seeing that I didn't yet have 2FA myself.

So all goes well for a while (a month or so), and I end up going through a lot of stressful happenings in my life, so when she reaches out one afternoon I am more quiet than normal and let her know I just need some space for a bit. She graciously understands, and the day progresses. Suddenly I get a message that says ""wtf"" late into the evening and then it promptly deletes itself. I ask her about that and she is understandably upset as am I, since this now feels like a clear violation of privacy going on (also I never seen her ever use the expression 'wtf' before in any of our chats). Of course, we both have 2FA enabled and there were no suspicious devices in our logged in machines, so there was no smoking gun there. She also said she hadn't been on Discord at all. 

A half hour later, a new message comes in from her in my notifications that says ""i just want to be with you and I cant. Im sorry"". Again, it shows up for a second when I open the client and disappears a second later. The writing style doesn’t match hers so I already know it's not her. Also, I have noticed that on phones, the first letter is usually auto-capitalized, but not on the PC, and primarily uses mobile, but who knows. So I share this with her and we are even both more understandably upset and feeling like our privacy has been violated yet again. Following this, she once again changes her password, and formats the desktop PC she was using that had the Discord client. She has since not installed Discord on any PC since then, and uses mobile exclusively. 

We haven't seen any of these messages in the last month, but being shaken, we honestly haven't talked much or as openly about things, since we don't know how or why these messages appeared like they have. 

Another interesting note is that last week, I went to send a message to a friend in Instagram and noticed that in my message history, her profile picture was suddenly all black, instead of a normal profile picture. I clicked on it and it said the account was private, or something of that nature, there was little information. I thought that was odd and asked her if she blocked me in DM. She was, of course, incredulous and said that she had not done that and that she was going to change her Instagram password right then and there. From what I could see, this blocking had only happened to me, and no other friends.

That's the story so far, and hopefully I've included enough detail for you to draw a theory from. What do you think was happening here? 

Do you think it was a rogue hacker that swiped an access token while she was surfing on coffee shop WiFi and being creepy? If so, how did the same person retain access after the changed password and addition of 2FA? Potentially had access through another vector on her PC and so it didn't matter what she did if she logged in on the machine? There is some sense to that, especially given the odd spelling and punctuation usage. But why did the messages delete right after? But then, why is our chat the only chat this person is engaged with? I tried to search the internet for anyone else who had experienced something like this, but I came up empty-handed. After talking with experts, it appears this option is very unlikely, but including it for the context.

Or do you think the answer is simpler, and it was more likely someone who has physical access to her devices (her or friends/family)? Based on my limited understanding (I have not pressed this issue with her), the only person in the vicinity to her devices was her husband, and she vehemently swears he would never do anything remotely like that. She has, a few months ago told me that her husband had expressed some level of jealously regarding how close we are. She impressed upon me that it's not an issue, but it does appear there is tension in their relationship that exists because of our relationship.  It would also be relatively easy to manipulate Instagram and block people with direct access to a logged in device. I unfortunately don't check Instagram often, so I had no idea when that happened, so I can't pinpoint timing. 

What's your opinion, or maybe there's another explanation? The odd happenings have strained our friendship, and if was someone's intent to distance us, it's making an impact. ",0,1753275417.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False
1m78ivi,https://i.redd.it/7fcxv0vtfmef1.jpeg,3 months with Luna Gen 2 low-key fixed my sleep and stress without me trying too hard,"Initially I was very curious of trying on a smart ring for myself all thanks to Smart Ring Community, did actually get to a few like Oura but was skeptical to commit to their subscription model. Hence, ended up picking up Luna Gen 2, and figured I’d just give it a try and glance at a few graphs here and there. Fast forward to now I check the app daily, track trends weekly, and I’m actually sleeping and recovering better than I have in years.

I used to average 6.5–7 hrs of sleep, but Luna showed my sleep efficiency was hovering around 74%. After tweaking my night routine (less blue light, earlier dinners), I’m now at 86–89% efficiency with better deep sleep scores.
REM has gone up by 20–30 mins per night on average, and I wake up feeling like I actually rested.

Luna started flagging low HRV (~38ms) on days I thought I was fine. Turns out, I was under-recovering after back-to-back workouts or late nights.
Now I check my Readiness Score (avg. ~78–84) each morning — if it’s low, I dial it back. Simple as that. Recovery’s smoother, and I’ve avoided that drained, burnt-out feeling.

Few things which I really like about the application- Dashboard’s clean, customizable, my top three: sleep score, temp variation, and HRV. Caffeine window feature is clutch (I was drinking coffee at 7 PM before… yikes)
Hidden “Suggest a Feature” button in settings is a cool touch. Also the ring's Battery life is upto 5–6 days, no complaints :)

Trust me, since I have had this ring, the look and feel everything gives great pleasure and it is how ideally a ring should make its users feel...

I agree with determinists for the most part - an object can’t be moved unless something else causes it to move, an event must be caused by a prior event - this is undeniable on a physical level.

But some determinists take that to mean that we definitely have no free will. I’m not saying they’re wrong, but how do they know they’re right? How do we know that the exact nature of our thoughts is determined by a one-to-one, cause and effect type of interaction with physical matter? Did the arrangement of atoms in the universe necessarily imply that I chose coffee instead of tea this morning, and my idea of “will” is just an illusion?

I know this might come across like a god-of-the-gaps argument, but I’m not saying they’re definitely wrong. It just doesn’t really make sense to me and it seems like they’re assuming things they couldn’t possibly know, since we don’t really understand how thoughts and consciousness, or even brains, actually work. “We’ve always observed B to be caused by A, so that must be the case universally” seems like bad philosophy to me.",1,1753275297.0,freewill,20,0.56,False

1m78dq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1m78dq3/12_days_in_japan_tokyo_osaka_and_hiroshima/,"12 Days in Japan (Tokyo, Osaka and Hiroshima)","Hi everyone.  We've just got back from our trip to Japan and thought I'd share some of the things we discovered whilst there that might be helpful for future travellers.

Firstly we are a family of 4 (two adults, a 15 year old and a neurodiverse 9 year old with ADHD).  

I planned most of the trip about 6 months in advance, watching youtube videos, reading these forums and viewing websites.  I usually like to book things every month to spread the costs starting as early as we can.  Unfortunately for a technological impressive country their booking systems are awful. (We live in New Zealand).  The only thing we could book in advance was accommodation.  We only managed to find one place that had 4 bed's in a room and every other hotel we had to book 2 rooms with a double bed (next to each other) - This actually worked quite nicely and we let the kids have their own room.  

The first lesson we learnt was that once you pay for your accommodation on [booking.com](http://booking.com) or the likes, you lose all ability to make changes to them.  We make a mistake with a property in Osaka and nothing doing they wouldn't refund us, let us change etc. and we were forced to use that accommodation.  So rather book and then pay the week before (or when the site says you have to pay - that way you can book a few places and cancel the ones you don't want).

Booking really started in earnest 2 months prior to departure when everything starts opening up.. Some locations are 2 months, some 1 month, some 2 weeks, etc.  So you need to diarise when you want to book everything.  We managed to get into everything except the Pokemon Cafe in Osaka which literally sold out within 1 minute (we tried on 3 different days).  The biggest frustration was Universal Studios - their Japan site would not accept our credit cards (Visa / Mastercard), my brother in the USA (AMEX and Mastercard) and Wise (Online).  When we spoke to them and copied and pasted every step of the process they told us blatantly that there was nothing wrong with their system.  Very arrogant considering there are hundreds of reddit forums about this topic.  We eventually bought from the English site and managed to get an Express 4 Pass.

We didn't book any ""Travel"" prior to departure (though many people told us we should).  We arrived at the airport and it was quick through Customs / Immigration / Bag Collection and we were out shortly after,  We did use the QR code process which made it much quicker and I highly recommend this.

We purchased 4 x Suica cards - The self service terminals worked in English and were easy to use.  We then thought we could use that for the Narita Express (NRT) but were told we had to get a ticket and with help of a person there we bought four tickets to Shinagawa.  We underestimated the length of the trains and how far you have to drag your luggage to get to the car and seat you have booked.  So make sure you leave some time to get there.

We stayed in Shinagawa and the hotel had a shuttle to the station and back.  It made such a difference (especially in the 34+ degC heat).  We used google maps and it got everything right except once on the entire trip (from accommodation to station to station, to transfers, to destinations).

Everyone said cash was king..  We found very few places that didn't accept a credit card or the Suica card and probably only drew out cash twice on the entire trip.  

The 7-11 / Lawsons and Family Marts were life savers for breakfast and after a long day out and you don't feel like going to a restaurant.  The price of food compared to NZ was amazingly cheap ($20 to $30NZD for a meal for 4 people including drinks and coffee).

We visited Shibuya (Disappointing - I think you have to be there at specific times) and tried going above the Starbucks to get a better view but everything is cordoned off as pay areas.  Takihata Street was enjoyable and Akihabara Electric Town was just overwhelming.  We found some electronics were cheaper and some were more expensive.. So do your homework before buying.  Tax free they told us we couldn't open anything, so we didn't but the process at the airport on the way back was to scan my passport - they didn't ask to see anything - so you can use it before departure.

Highlights in Tokyo were : Team Lab Planets (Spent over 4 hours), Avatar Cafe (Unique idea and helping the disabled community) and Disney Sea (We spent two days and still didn't really get to see everything - we skipped most of the stuff we had seen a Disney in the USA).  We arrived at Disney Sea 1 hour early on Day 1 and 1h20 on Day 2 and there were about 1,500 ahead of us on Day 1 and 1,000 on Day 2.   So if you really want to be in early and first you're looking at 2 to 2.5 hours before opening.  Ueno park was also impressive,   

We did 1 x 1 day tour to Hakone, Pirate Boat Ride, Ropeway and back.  English tour, but there were 60+ people on the bus and it was a very long day (6am to 10pm) and a lot of time on the bus driving between locations.  It was a good way to see everything but not sure I'd do any more.  The price was cheap and we realised this is because it doesn't include the Boat Ride, the Lunch, Drinks etc.  

The day prior to leaving we booked our Bullet Train (Shinkansen) tickets with the help of the service counter.  No issues getting the times we wanted but again finding the right entrance (North, South or Central) was terrifying the first time and getting to the Car and worrying about missing it.  Once we had done it once it was really easy and the trip was actually so quick.  Note that if you want to have big luggage you need to book the seats at the end not in the middle.  We managed to put our reasonable sized suitcases up on the rack above us quite comfortably.

Highlight of Osaka: Wandering around the Dotonbori Canal at night (we did a 20 minute cruise, but to be honest was a waste or time and money and got better photos walking).  We did the Ferris Wheel at Don Quixote which was fun but would had been nicer if they washed the windows as there was so much reflection.  We enjoyed Universal Studios, but the queues were ridiculous, the 4D shows are all in Japanese and so we struggled to understand what was going on.  We tried using the ""some wait in line and some wait in a room"" service but it was such a mission.  They didn't understand us and when they finally did (using translation devices) our 9 year old hated it and then we had to go fetch them - so we didn't bother doing it again.  The Aquarium was great (Blue Whales) and lots of people told us the tanks were small, but we certainly didn't feel that.  We loved the line on the floor showing the distance to the end of the aquarium.  The Namba Yasaka Shrine was impressive and the Osaka Castle was okay.

Lowlights : Team Lab Borderless (Got bitten by mosquitos and it was a total of 45 minutes and nothing spectacular).  

We purchased the JR Pass (West) from Osaka to Hiroshima as it was cheaper than a ticket there and back..  And we used it on the Ferry as well at Miyajima

Next up Hiroshima.  The Museum was great, but less enjoyable as there were just too many people packed in.  You couldn't even walk, it was smore of a shuffle.  Outside the museum the Memorial and Dome were worth visiting.  It's quite sobering going through the place so be prepared.. We closed our 9 year olds eyes at some locations we thought we a bit too ""graphic"" for him to understand / grasp.

Hiroshima Castle was okay, with nice views from the top (but not airconditioned).  Off to Miyajima the next day.. We really enjoyed Miyajima (from the deer to the Torii gate and Shrines) but unfortunately the ropeway was under maintenance.  We spent the better part of a day there and got some spectacular photos.  

From there it was back to Tokyo for a few days before flying out..

What did we learn:    
   It's frigging hot during summer (29 at night to 38 some days)  
   You're likely to do between 20K and 30K steps a day.  
   You can do everything with Public Transport (and a Suica card was a must)  
   Stations can be 500m to 1km of walking between them (even underground).  
   You don't need to use luggage services - We found it really easy to go between places.  
   The beds are hard and uncomfortable and the pillows even more so  
   Some hotels reset the temp to 23 degC and some don't go below 21 or 22 degC.  
   You can get McDonalds, KFC etc. there (everywhere) and order in English.  The Melon drink is great.  
   Watch out for ""women only"" carriages - We made a mistake once and it was very uncomfortable.  
   There is no ""bottomless"" drinks at any of the Theme parks in Japan (unlike the USA)  
   You can use your Credit Card at 90% of the places.  
   Onsens are a lot more confusing than we thought.  Many have videos explaining the process / rules.  
   Most food places / malls have very limited seating.  
   Eating out at Restaurants and at Disney / Universal is a lot more expensive (2x to 3x the price)  
   Be prepared to take about 200 to 300 photos a day and have a spare battery pack. My S24 was at 40% by lunch every day and one day it nearly overheated due to use and temperature.  
   How to say ""Hello"" and ""Thank you"" in Japanese (It's the two most common words used)  
   Bring along a digital device for the kids (we have Nintendo Switches) and kept them occupied on the bullet trains and long travel days.  (As well as all the charging stuff).  
Don't bring anything that uses 240V (I brought an electric razor and it wouldn't even turn on)  
  
I hope this helps some of you and happy to answer any questions.  We're by no means specialists on Japan but we are quite seasoned travelers (about once every year to 2 years we go somewhere - but almost always English speaking places when travelling with the kids).

The stuff she leaves on the table ranges from her iPad to trash (there’s also a trash can nearby) that I end up cleaning off so I can move the table. She has also complained in the past about how she was always cleaning up after everyone else. But yet when she does it, there’s little to criticism about it. 

I personally don’t mind moving everything out of the way for the Roomba to do its job, but I’m getting tired of constantly cleaning off that table full of her stuff.

I even directly asked my stepmom and she said she would try, but my dad told me to drop it. I’m fully aware that they do more work around the house, but I feel like I shouldn’t constantly be cleaning up after my stepmom. Ignoring it won’t do any good because it’s only going to make it worse.

I was so excited to be pregnant. I was holding onto the fact that I would feel so much better during my second trimester and I don’t. I’m less nauseous, but I still feel terrible. I drink coffee and that makes me feel shaky and doesn’t give me any energy. I take 4 hour naps, sleep for 9 hours at night AND IM STILL TIRED. 

I’m so freaking over it. It’s really debilitating because doing the things I used to love to do (homemaking, cooking, baking, reading, working out) are the biggest freaking chore in the world. On top of that, my toddler is crazy and it’s too hot outside to do anything. 

I hate this pregnancy. Experienced NONE of these problems when I was pregnant with my first. Which is what made me want another. What. A. Freaking. Joke. ",8,1753274592.0,pregnant,10,1.0,False

Since Monday, my energy levels are in the toilet. I'm sleeping my usual amount I think, and work and personal life are normal. But my motivation is low, I can't pull myself off the couch and I have no desire to go to the gym. Since June, my average daily steps have gone from 3k to 10k. This week is it absolutely back to 3k a day if not less. I'm close to just going to bed in the middle of the afternoon. I do take antidepressants but everything is all good and I've been on them for years. No menstrual cycle (long story but all healthy and fine)

My workout routine is treadmill at least three times a week at 12% incline. On Monday, I started doing weights: chest press, shoulder press, lat raise, leg press. But I'm not good at it and so the weights are low. Approximate protein intake 90grams. My diet is eggs, tuna, vegetables, chicken and rice and pasta. Some beef, some beans. Little to no junk food except a bag of popped crisps occasionally. My only vice is beer. I have one or two low alcohol, low calorie beers a night. I don't drink coffee but I drink about two cups of black tea a day.

1m7846q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/comments/1m7846q/mais_oui_the_dreaded_dnf/,"Mais oui, the dreaded DNF","I turn 50 next month and my birthday present to myself was going to be walking the Via Podiensis from Le Puy-en-Velay to Pamplona which is where I walked the French from with my best friend in 2004. (I also proposed to my wife who’s from Stgo the night I finished.) In the interim a benign tumor the size of an avocado seed was discovered in my kneecap; I broke my leg riding my road bike on slippy pavement before surgery. My leg got bowed off straight 1–2 degrees from the break which I was told is in the range of normal. I fell out of love with walking for I didn't feel like my old self biomechanically and I stopped running (I ran in hs and college where I was all-conference in cross country and track). I hadn't ever thought of walking a Camino again until about 6 months ago when I walked my dog to and from my son's soccer game probably a modest 12 kms roundtrip but I felt great. This lit a spark in my head and I got permission from my wife to do the Le Puy this summer and she was fully supportive. 

So, I got all of my ducks in a row and was jonesing to do the Camino. As everyone knows it's no small feat to ""get all the gear"" to which my wallet will attest. Last Friday I took an overnight bus to Lyon and caught a train to Le Puy from the bus station. I had all day to kill in Le Puy and grew increasingly concerned with my leg. A couple weeks prior I was in Mexico City and although we took Ubers everywhere one day I walked to coffee shops and put some mileage down but nothing crazy. My leg has never been the same since: I don't know if it's a flared IT band or what but the outside of my bad leg's knee feels tight and is painful to the touch. My leg ""locks up"" when I walk. 

Operating under the premise that it would kill me if I didn't try, I went to Le Puy hoping for the best but it was a shit show. There I was nervously on the precipice between the walk of a lifetime for my bday celebrating a half century or turning around and going back before taking a first step. I wanted introspection and all the glory from my second Camino on foot. I've cycled more Caminos than I can count and these are rich experiences but I wanted to walk a Camino again because it’s out of my comfort zone and immensely rewarding. 

However it wasn't meant to be: I called my wife plus a couple of friends with serious doubt the evening before. I had just bought my credential. My 24L Osprey Stratos was dialed. Black Diamond hiking poles check. But when I got to my gites there was a French girl sitting on her bunkbed. She didn’t speak English so we were having that introductory exchange about where we’re from, what we’re doing etc. She had no idea of the gravity of the moment for me. I typed in the translator app the gist of what was going on and I could read a *merde, d’accord* in her head nod. 

On my wife’s advice, I decided to sleep on it and woke up just before 6:30 a.m. to decide whether to walk to the cathedral or DNS. I remained undecided. I literally set off walking and halfway to the cathedral veered off for the train station instead.

My leg just wasn't giving me confidence and my fear was crippling. I also had weight from the first Camino for I knew what I was getting into whereas in 2004 I was blissfully ignorant. I’m also 49 versus 29 when I walked the French. What pisses me off is that 50 won. I feel like my age got the best of me. I don't think I would've caved in my 30s. But I got broken from the reality that my bad leg isn't what it was and I'm older. I’m not as agile mentally, physically and able to pivot as easily. Was it all in my head? Sure, somewhat, but my leg issue was real. It’s not like me to quit but I did. 

Family and friends can't relate. The only people who can understand are those who’ve been in these trail running shoes before. It's a lonely decision. I don't think there's a right or wrong per se but ultimately the decision is yours to live with. I'm sharing this story for others who’ve been there. 

My friend Dario whom I met on the Camino in 2004 texted:

*hey i hope you are feeling better in the morning but as said listening to your body in detail and attentively is paramount here. If you decide that now isn't the best time, know that the Camino will be there when you are ready.*

What I struggled with was starting and not finishing which isn’t something I wanted to do. My fear was debilitating. I didn't want to finish around noon and sit around all day by myself but rather feel strong and walk long stages. I knew if by some miracle I could make it that it would be shuffling my feet or crawling and I wasn't interested in being a gimp. I would've never considered Camino 2.0 had my leg been like this in the lead up. What came up in CDMX was new: the feeling that my leg (outside of knee) was locking up. 

I didn’t want to do the Camino compromised. I didn’t want to walk through an injury that I could pay a price for down the road. Since I have nothing to prove to myself, I did what was probably wise even though my decision stews me. I will always question it and wish that my Camino had happened, but I couldn’t grasp it this time. The Via Podiensis proved elusive and I feel human. I didn’t have the fortitude, physical nor mental, and the looming challenge broke me in Le Puy. 

So I made one of the most difficult decisions of my life to head back home. Two friends met me at the train station in Barcelona. They made a cardboard sign with my nickname and one was playing ""In Your Eyes"" by Peter Gabriel on her phone referencing some John Cusack romcom that I haven’t seen. We had a vermouth then pizza and a beer. I was hoping to get some of the weight of the decision off my chest but like I said, my friends couldn't relate to the gravity of my decision to quit the Camino so I kept it light. They were there to support me throwing in the towel unconditionally as true friends which was everything in the moment. 

I don't think a Camino on foot will present itself to me again but never say never. I may just be a cyclist which is non-weight bearing and have to do an epic ride next year. If I fly by you at Mach 1 and don't have a bell on my cross bike or I scare you out of your thousand-yard stare unintentionally don't get pissy, cyclists aren't in a hurry. Their Camino is different from walkers and all of us are on the same road. Buen Camino to everyone especially those who have, are, or will fail.

Here’s the breakdown based on in-hand feel, fit, and first impressions. Most tees are TTS, but always check seller measurements just in case.

Godspeed New York Short Sleeves
Wasn’t sure at first, but this hits. Slight street-prep blend with the Godspeed NYC graphic — fabric’s soft with nice weight. Clean neck and sleeve stitching.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7503015281

Ami Shirt
Crisp button-up feel, slightly relaxed cut. Embroidered logo feels premium, not a glued patch. Great summer shirt — doesn’t scream “designer,” but gives quiet flex.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7494176359

Balenciaga Short Sleeves
Boxy and bold. Fabric’s heavy with a dry-touch texture, and the print is clean — nothing sloppy. It’s oversized by design, so size down if you don’t want the drop-shoulder look.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7502531665

Stüssy White Short Sleeves
Classic surfer-skater Stüssy vibe. Clean logo hit on white, comfy tee with a nice drape. This one’s easy to throw on with cargos or denim.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7501706350

Givenchy Short Sleeves
Sleek and understated. Black tee with sharp font logo — feels like an elevated basic. TTS but the length runs slightly longer than standard.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7510958053

Drew House Short Sleeves
Fun, cartoon-vibe tee with nice softness. Fits boxy but still flattering. The smiley logo’s clean — not oversized or peeling. Definitely a chill-day fit.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7490991678

Ape Pink Short Sleeves
Unexpected favorite. Color pops in person, print looks sharp, and cotton is solid quality. Runs slightly short in length but works for summer.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7504057042

Chrome Hearts Plaid Shorts
Super cozy with a subtle CH flex. Fabric feels more flannel than mesh — good for cooler evenings. Waistband has enough stretch, fit is slightly roomy.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7500632577

Gallery Dept Yellow T-shirt
Definitely loud. Dye job looks intentional, print holds up after first wash. Fit is boxy, sleeves drop low. Very streetwear, not for minimalist days.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7499835647

Ape White T-shirt
Thick and durable tee with classic BAPE logo. Fit is a little cropped and sleeves are wide — great with cargos or double-knee pants.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7499804748

Acne Studios Short Sleeves
Minimalism done right. Logo is tiny and clean, fabric’s light but smooth. This is one of those wear-anywhere pieces — coffee shop or night out.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7490790932

Ape Short Sleeves
Bold camo styling and classic Ape graphics. Print pops, and material is breathable. Slightly tight at the shoulders, so size up if you lift or want comfort.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7508850578

Gucci Short Sleeves
Logomania vibes but not too overdone. The fabric feels silky-soft, stitching looks decent. This one toes the line between streetwear and luxury well.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7513921290

Red Short Sleeves
This one’s simple but hits. Solid red with small logo text — gives Uniqlo x streetwear energy. Easy daily tee. Not the softest, but no complaints.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7504530328

Godspeed New York Short Sleeves (Repost)
Wanted to try a second colorway — same notes as above. Steezy cut, clean logo, comfy tee. Pairs well with baggy shorts or carpenter pants.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7503015281

Burberry Beach Shorts
Lightweight, breezy, and surprisingly durable. Print is on point and doesn’t feel cheap. Elastic waist is strong, mesh lining inside. Vacation-ready.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7496143768

Louis Vuitton Shoe
Surprisingly good structure. Sole feels sturdy, upper stitching is clean. Looks like retail from a few feet away. Took half-size up for comfort.

1m781ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/unveilafrica/comments/1m781ta/how_ethiopian_coffee_conquered_the_world_from_one/,How Ethiopian Coffee Conquered The World From One Forest,"Check the Full Details Article Here:https://unveil.africa/how-ethiopian-coffee-conquered-the-world-from-one-forest/

Ethiopian coffee, revered as one of the finest coffees globally, traces its roots back to a single, ancient forest: the Kaffa region. This lush, mountainous area not only provides the ideal climate for coffee cultivation but also holds a rich history that reflects the journey of coffee from forest to global sensation.

Legend has it that the first discovery of this magical bean was made by a goat herder named Kaldi, who observed his goats experiencing unusual energy after eating the bright red cherries from the coffee tree. This serendipitous moment in the Kaffa forest laid the groundwork for an enduring love affair between humanity and coffee.

Today, the rich legacy of Ethiopian coffee can be attributed to its unique cultivation practices, biodiversity, and passionate communities. The coffee grown in Ethiopia boasts a diverse range of flavors, from fruity and floral to earthy and spicy, largely because of the variance in altitude and the rich soil supported by the forest ecosystem.

As trade routes expanded, Ethiopian coffee began to conquer international markets. Key cities such as Harar and Sidamo became influential trade centers, exporting high-quality Arabica coffee worldwide. Coffee from Ethiopia soon found its place in cafes across Europe and America, becoming a cultural staple.

- **Flavors:** Ethiopian coffee features bright acidity with hints of citrus and floral notes.
- **Varieties:** Unique varieties like Yirgacheffe and Sidamo exemplify the region’s rich biodiversity.
- **Cultural significance:** Coffee ceremonies in Ethiopia continue to be an integral part of social interaction, showcasing the cultural importance of coffee.

The journey of Ethiopian coffee from the depths of the Kaffa forest to the world stage is a testament to its quality and cultural ties. As lovers of coffee seek authenticity, the legacy of Ethiopian coffee continues to thrive, welcoming new enthusiasts and ensuring that its origins are never forgotten.

1m77yls,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1m77yls/my_past_week/,My past week.,"This is just what I went through, I’m not exactly trying to quit but I am tweaking at the revelation. I wanted to share my experience. I am 22(f)

So Saturday it began, I was feeling weak and fatigued, like I was going to pass out if I stood for more then 5 minutes. My body started to ache around this time as well. 

Sunday same thing but WORSE, my lower back was KILLING ME. I felt like I was having flu symptoms but there was nothing wrong with my head/face. No congestion, no cough nothing. I was miserable. I would have the pain take Tylenol, go to sleep at like 8 pm. I woke up feeling freezing at 1 am, then fell back asleep to wake up in a pool of sweat for work. I figured all my symptoms could stem from my new medication that I was taking or my period. (Though it was a normal) 

Monday, I don’t even remember because I was in so much pain. I still woke up in the night freezing, in pain. I took Tylenol and went back to bed. I had stomach pains around this time and was feeling a bit nauseous(not puking.)  I went to bed at  6pm, when I woke up 10 pm I was freezing and in pain so I got up to go take Tylenol and I about passed out. My hearing went, my head spun and I barely made it back to my bed.

Tuesday, the pain in my back, knees and dizziness was bad, but I knew I had a doctors appointment to confirm if my new medications were causing the problems. (They weren’t) so I decided to go to the walk in clinic because I was miserable. I tell them my symptoms and then refer me to the ER. So I go because I want to feel better and they run all these tests and only find that I’m dehydrated. So I get fluids but all throughout the day my back was getting worse and worse. I was LAYING in a hospital bed but my back was getting worse. I was released 5 hours later feeling better dizzy wise and got some pain relief for my lower back. It helped but not fully. Same thing in the night, woke up freezing at 12am, woke up sweaty at 4:45am. 

TODAY: my back pain is still here, it’s been FIVE days with this pain, my legs felt funky, my knees hurt. I thought my kidneys were FKED, or I had arthritis. I get to work my head feels like it’s on a pike, my neck hurts? My chest feel heavy and I am dragging into work. I take ibuprofen this time to gauge and see if it is arthritis. I Planned on going to my primary physician about my back pain. While I miserable at work I asked my dad. “Should I caffeine help?” He gave me a nod and I got up and had this protein shake that has about 1 cup of coffee worth of caffeine in it. 

Are you ready for the revelation of a DUMB DUMB? Allllll my symptoms went away besides some soreness in my back, tbf I did have this pain for 5 days so soreness is to be expected. Then I googled it. Caffeine withdrawals can give you fatigue, weakness, nausea and, AND muscle pains. I started to think back, when WAS the last time I had caffeine? Not Saturday(maybe a Diet Coke), not Sunday, I don’t think so Monday. I definitely didn’t have any yesterday. 

IT ALL MADE SENSE, and all my worries were POOF gone. I’m so dumb sometimes  do forget to drink caffeine but I usually only get a migraine that doesn’t go away. THIS was 10x WORSE then anything I had before. So now I’m sitting here both flabbergasted, angry and happy. I think I could’ve broken my caffeine addiction yes, but I don’t think I could personally last up to another 4 days. I did what I had to.

As life gets busier, people value convenience more than ever. Whether you run a busy office, a gym, or a retail store, keeping employees and customers happy is key. A vending machine can be a simple way to provide snacks, drinks, or small essentials on-site. Is it the perfect match for your space? Let’s dive into the benefits, considerations, and tips to help you decide if a vending machine is a smart addition to your business or office.

# Why Add a Vending Machine?

A vending machine brings instant convenience and can enhance the experience for everyone in your space. Here’s why it’s worth considering:

# 1. Convenience at Its Best

A vending machine offers quick access to snacks, drinks, or even small items like phone chargers without anyone needing to leave the premises. For employees working late or customers waiting for services, it’s a lifesaver that saves time and keeps people focused.

# 2. Boosts Employee Morale

A well-stocked vending machine shows employees you care about their comfort. Offering quick bites or refreshing drinks can make the workplace more enjoyable, leading to happier, more productive teams.

# 3. Extra Income Stream

For businesses with foot traffic, like salons or fitness centers, a vending machine can generate additional revenue. Even small purchases add up, making it a low-effort way to increase profits.

# 4. Flexible Options

Today’s vending machines go beyond chips and soda. You can stock healthy snacks, coffee, or even non-food items tailored to your audience’s needs, making it a versatile addition to any space.

# Things to Consider Before Installing

While vending machines come with numerous benefits, choosing the right setup ensures they meet your specific needs:

# 1. Space Availability

Vending machines are available in a range of sizes, from small countertop designs to full-sized units. Ensure you have enough room without crowding your space or disrupting its flow. A cluttered setup can look unprofessional.

# 2. Maintenance Needs

Keeping the machine stocked and functional is crucial. Partnering with reliable vending machine services can take the hassle out of restocking and repairs, ensuring it runs smoothly.

# 3. Budget Planning

There are costs to consider, like purchasing or leasing the machine and buying inventory. If funds are tight, explore rental options or partnerships where providers handle upkeep for a share of the profits.

# 4. Audience Preferences

Who will use the machine? Employees might want quick snacks, while gym clients may prefer protein bars or energy drinks. Matching the products to your audience’s needs is key to success.

# Tips for Choosing the Right Vending Machine

To make the most of your investment, keep these tips in mind:

* **Pick the Right Type**: Snack and drink combos work well for offices, while specialized machines (like coffee dispensers) suit specific businesses.
* **Go Modern**: Choose machines with cashless payment options like card readers or mobile apps to cater to today’s preferences.
* **Focus on Efficiency**: Energy-efficient machines cut electricity costs and align with eco-friendly goals.
* **Prioritize Maintenance**: Opt for machines that are easy to clean and service to avoid downtime.

# Overcoming Potential Challenges

Vending machines are generally low-maintenance, but issues can arise:

* **Spoilage**: Expired products frustrate users. Regular restocking prevents this.
* **Technical Glitches**: Machines can break down, so choose a provider with quick repair services.
* **Usage Balance**: Monitor whether the machine is overused (running out of stock) or underused (stale products) and adjust inventory accordingly.

# Is It Worth It?

For many offices and businesses, a vending machine is a smart move. It boosts convenience, improves satisfaction, and can bring in extra cash. Success depends on selecting the right machine, maintaining it well, and matching products to your audience. With [vending machine services](https://musthavevending.com/) handling the heavy lifting, it’s a low-effort way to add value.

# Final Thoughts

A vending machine can be a small but impactful addition to your office or business. It keeps employees energized, customers happy, and can even pad your profits. Before jumping in, assess your space, budget, and audience needs. With the right machine and support, it’s a simple way to elevate your space and keep everyone satisfied.

Everything after the motel was nothing more than a blur. After checking that his belongings were still in the room, James donned his winter clothing and took a ride with the deputy south towards the hospital that sat in Pinecreek. He was seen by the medical staff still lingering at the tail end of their graveyard shifts. Having been admitted around five in the morning, James was treated for his broken nose; his leg, although injured at the shin’s skin, had not suffered a broken bone.

While alone in the room where he was treated, he felt a looming anxiety—it was as if whatever had been back at the motel would somehow, and in some way, show up to terrorize him again. As the minutes passed by, though, the only thing that would show up was the same deputy who had brought him in.

*“Well, everything’s been done and accounted for over here. You’re free to go.”*

*“...I don’t have a way back to town.”*

*“Sir, I’m afraid to tell you that I can’t ferry you everywhere you need to go. The folk up front can fetch a ride for you, I’m sure of it.”*

*“…Okay. Well, thanks for what you’ve done for me, man. I... I know that I sounded pretty crazy back there. I swear, though, everything that I told you is true, God as my witness.”*

*“It’s not up to me to decide those things while on the clock. Like I told you before, I can’t say you’re lying. Just try to be careful, you know?”*

*“Yeah. I forgot, in between all of this, to ask—what’s your name, mister... Chamberlain?”* James said, his mind calm enough to finally notice the deputy’s name tag.

*“Daniel,”* he replied, turning as he spoke. *“Have a good day now, sir. If you remember more—or have any questions—feel free to visit the office. Say you’re acquainted with me already. We’re just up the road north from where you’re staying at.”*

Deputy Chamberlain was gone, responding to indiscernible chatter on his radio as he made his way out of sight. James rose with deliberate slowness from the hospital bed, pain dulled by medicine as he put weight back onto the leg that had been struck. He walked out with a gingerly gait and went to talk to the nurses gathered near the front desk, awaiting the end of the overnight shift. With their help, he heeded the officer’s advice and arranged for a cab to pick him up.

When the hospital lobby’s clock reached about six-thirty, it finally arrived; the words **ATKINS TAXI** emblazoned across a white sedan’s side, visible through the ice-slick glass of the lobby’s façade. James left and climbed inside the car, utterly tired from the combination of medicine and what happened earlier.

His consciousness lapsed once more as the cab took the country roads back up toward Cedarcrest, drifting into an involuntary, dreamless sleep with the help of the car’s heater.

\---

The cab creaked slowly to a stop as it found purchase in the parking lot of the motel, where James was then roused awake by the driver. With the fare paid, James opened the door and stepped out, finding himself awash in the red and orange light of dawn flowing across the open sky. Although dreadfully tired at this point, James knew there would be little time today for long-term rest.

James plodded his way toward the motel office as the cab peeled off, finding a middle-aged man instead of Cathy sitting behind the desk.

*“Hello there, mister! You’re that James fellow, right?”* he asked, his face betraying some surprise.

*“Yes, sir. Cathy, uh... she told me—”*

*“Oh, I know! She’s moved you to 110 now. No worries about the cost, too; we took that night off your bill for you.”*

*“...In that case, tell her I said thanks. I really appreciate it.”*

*“No problem,”* the man said, extending a hand. *“Almost forgot to say—the name’s Jim.”*

James reached out and shook his hand in kind. *“Good to meet you, Jim.”*

*“Now, we had to leave your belongings in 106 until the sheriff’s boys gave us the okay to do anything else. Want me to help you move your stuff to the new room?”*

*“Nah, I’ll be fine; it’s just a bag. Thanks for the offer, though.”*

*“No problem. Might be a little crude to say this to you now, but… I’m sure you’ll love being here in Cedarcrest. It’s just a real damn shame it all started off on the wrong foot. You’re staying for a week, yeah?”*

*“That’s right.”*

*“What for, if you don’t mind me asking?”*

*“I’m just here to visit a friend. From the Coast Guard, when we served together.”*

*“You served, huh? Well then, I should be thanking you for your service! What’s your friend’s name, by chance? I probably know him, given how close us folk are around here...”*

*“It’s David. David Hiers.”*

James saw Jim briefly contemplate it, his hand resting on his salt-and-pepper chin for a moment.

*“David...? David... ah, yeah, I think that I know him! He’s the guy who opened that boat and raft store some years back, if I’m remembering right. Makes sense now why he went and did that!”*

*“Yeah. Me and him talk regularly about the boating business. I have a little repair shop of my own down in New Orleans…”*

*“Ah, now that’s just quite nice! Well, I’ll stop badgering you. Must’ve been a long night, from what Cathy’s told me. If you need anything, one of us is always in here. 106 is open for you now—you can go in and get what you need.”*

*“Alrighty, then,”* James said as he accepted the keys for the new room. He waved goodbye to the male attendant as he left the office, the sky now morphing into a light blue and yellow. As he gazed up at the display, the first bright inklings of sunlight began to reach over the treetops of the dark forest that lay across the street. He stood there, the gauze taped across his nose and the pain in his leg an afterthought, as he took in the distant chirps of birds awakening for the new day.

James felt, just for a moment, at peace again.

After a sluggish return to reality, he lugged himself over to Room 106 with pangs of dread beating in his chest. Opening the door, he immediately turned on the entrance light and dashed to open the blinds, sending in the soft dawn light to dimly illuminate what lay within. Apart from the duffel bag on the floor and the dark red stain near the now-silent television, there was nothing out of the ordinary. He picked up his duffel bag, scanned the room once more for anything he might have missed, and promptly left with an urgency in his step.

James shut the door and turned left, walking down the overhang toward the front of Room 110. Opening it with the new set of keys he had been given, that same chill crept down his spine as he looked into the dark, dispelling it with 110’s own entrance light. James placed his bag next to the bed and glanced around. This room, much like 106, was nothing more than a bed, a chair, and a television. Even so, there were minute differences he could spot between the two, such as differing bedsheet patterns. Not wishing to give it more thought, though, he left the room and locked it thereafter before heading down to the payphone that sat at the end of the motel’s wing.

After inserting some change, he dialed David’s number and stood in the morning chill, a free hand buried once more into his pocket. The buzz of the tone went on in his right ear for some time. It left James to look around idly amidst the cold dawn, watching his breath rise and drift away. Just when he thought this plan might be useless, his call was finally picked up.

*“...Ugh, hello? Hello? Who’s this?”*

*“It’s James, man. Wanted to tell you that I finally got here. I thought you woke up earlier than this?”*

*“Oh, goddamn it! Is it seven already? Well, anyway, how are you doing?”*

*“Like total shit. I got here from Albany at around midnight. Then, at around four in the morning… someone broke into my motel room. I’ve even got the broken nose to prove it.”*

*“…What the hell!? Did you manage to fuck up that asshole in return?”*

James laughed slightly at David’s words. *“I wish. I’ll tell you more about it later.”*

*“Alright. Well, I’m sorry to hear that happened to you, brother. You can crash at my place if you want to.”*

*“Nah, I’m fine for now. I don’t want to make your wife upset or anything. I’m just too tired today to drive, though, and I spent money on a cab to take me back to the motel from the hospital. You might need to pick me up.”*

*“Oh, yeah, sure. No problem. I’ll be there in about… ten or so minutes? Yeah, ten. Let’s hit up a diner first—I’ll be buying for both of us.”*

*“Thanks, man. I’ll wait.”*

The line went dead. James slid the phone back with a metallic clunk and, while turning to walk back toward his new room, noticed a yellow school bus chug along the street. Curious, he followed the bus with his eyes at it rounded a corner near the motel office. Behind the motel’s property sat a large expanse of buildings, with more yellow buses emerging and departing in kind, cars and trucks nearby letting out kids and teens alike. He realized that a school had been right next to him the entire time. One he hadn’t even seen the night before through the snowy haze, somehow.

This newfound fact sat low in James’s core, considering what happened to him a few hours ago. He hoped that whoever broke in wasn’t planning to hang around the school as well—for everyone’s sake.

James took out the pack of cigarettes he’d bought, putting one between his lips before lighting it with the fluid left in his lighter. He leaned against the wall next to his motel room and took a drag, the anxieties of last night briefly fading with the buzz he had so craved.

\---

True to his word, David did not take long. As the day began to manifest in full spectacle, with a rich, cloudless blue blanketing the sky, metal grumbles from a beige Toyota sounded as it pulled up in front of James. He had gone through multiple cigarettes by this point, their ashen remains sprinkled around him on the concrete and snow.

After putting the car in idle, David stepped out and raised both hands in a welcoming gesture.

*“There he is! Oh, damn,”* he said, dropping his arms as he noticed James’s broken nose. *“You look like you’re beaten to shit. A shame you didn’t punt the son of a bitch who did it.”*

*“Yeah...”*

*“You still haven’t quit the cigs, James?”* he said, motioning toward the ashes as he rounded the car. James dropped the butt he had remaining and stomped it into the slurry on the ground before catching David in a brief but firm hug.

*“I’ve been trying, man. But out of all the times that I want to... it’s almost like God knew I’d need it today.”*

*“Nah, it’s all good. I just hope you still want to eat something after all that shit, you know?”*

*“Not anything big, but yeah. I do.”*

*“Go ahead and hop on in, then,”* David said as he returned to the driver’s seat. *“This winter’s been a real bitch lately.”*

James opened the passenger door and sat inside; the cold was shunted away by the heat blowing directly onto his face. Condensation formed on the windows as both men shut their doors, with James staring at the drops as they rolled down. With David pulling out and onto the main road, they spotted the tail end of the school’s morning activity.

*“So, how are things back in your town?”* David asked, breaking the silence.

*“It’s just the same old shit. My cousins are helping run the shop while I’m gone, so I don’t have to worry about that at least...”*

*“Ha! That’s just like me with this kid, Barry, that I hired recently. I stick him in the shop four days out of the week, show him the ropes when I need to. Gives me time to hunt and range.”*

*“You fancy yourself a hunter now?”* James said, curious. *“I remember you back down south saying you hated outdoorsy stuff.”*

*“I changed, I guess. There’s not a whole lot to do up here if you aren’t the outdoorsy type, anyway.”*

After a brief silence held in the air, James was the first to speak.

*“What was it that made you move up here, really? You kept talking about going to New York City proper or just heading back home to Atlanta.”*

*“Honestly? It’s quiet. That’s what I needed. My parents left Georgia during our last years in the service, so there was no real point going back. And, having visited New York for a bit... the noise of it all was just driving me insane after a while.”*

*“A boat’s engine noise doesn’t annoy you, but city noise does?”*

*“I can’t explain it, man. I guess I’m just not tuned for the urban life, you know?”*

*“Fair enough. New Orleans is starting to get on my nerves, too, to be honest. It’s part of the reason I came up here... just needed a break for a bit. That’s all.”*

*“Oh, yeah; I think you’ll love it here.”*

*“The guy who runs the motel pretty much said the same thing to me. Is there some sort of PR campaign going on?”* James joked.

*“Is it PR if it’s true? I mean, it’s cold as hell, yeah—I’ll give you that much. But during the spring and summer, it’s almost perfect. The township as a whole is growing pretty fast, too. It ain’t so quick that the ‘spirit of it flies away,’ as some of the old-timers keep saying, but there’s enough new blood like me to keep things lively rather than be a nursing home.”*  
  
The conversation was cut short as David turned left across the breadth of the snow-swept road, pulling into a small parking lot that sat beneath a comically oversized blue dinner plate. Such a grandiose sign was held up by a stone pillar, the words **“BLUE PLATE DINER”** embossed across the snow-crusted rim of the plate. They were surrounded by the thickness of the woods, each tree laden with last night’s snow across every visible branch.

*“You said that Cedarcrest’s growing fast, right?”* James asked as the two stepped out of David’s car.

“*Yeah. Have you been convinced to move here that quickly?”* David said, pointing at his friend with a slight grin. *“Must be something in the air.”*

*“You wish. Nah, I’m asking because of what I saw driving up here. Pinecreek has a whole mall and hospital, all looking brand new. I’m just wondering* ***how****.”*

*“That place is right off the highway between Albany and the western parts of the state, so it makes sense that it’s growing like that. Maybe the city folk are finally getting tired of the chaos.”*

The two passed through the swinging doors of the diner’s entrance, soon finding themselves led by a waitress to a booth at its far end.

*“Alright, then; do you want to get into it all while we wait?”* David asked, clearly interested in what story was in store.

*“I’m telling you, David—what happened ain’t as flashy as you’re thinking it is. It’s not a movie scene.”*

*“Who cares? Just hit me.”*

With a sigh to start it off, James gradually began to tell his friend the timeline of his night terrors, their food arriving midway through. David started to eat his breakfast with eagerness while James picked at a small serving of eggs. He mostly opted to partake in the cheap coffee instead.

When the story reached the part about what the intruder looked like, the conversation began to shift in tone.

*“...I couldn’t bear to tell the cops this, or even the people running the motel. The thing moved like... like a hurt dog, or some other animal. Limping, or something like that. It wasn’t like a person. I thought that there was enough light in the room for me to have seen something on its body, too, but... nothing. There was literally nothing* ***to*** *see. It was like looking into a fucking... I don’t know, nothingness? I know it sounds crazy, but honestly, I don’t know what to make of it.”*

*“It could just be that you were half-asleep when this started, right? Like, your mind still making stuff up—screwing you over with your own imagination. That sort of thing.”*

*“I don’t know. I’m really hoping that’s what happened.”*

*“Dude, what the hell else would it even be?”* David said, stifling a laugh. *“Come on, now. There’ve been times when I’ve woken up thinking I was on a whole ‘nother planet. Freaky stuff can just happen sometimes without it being a ghost.”*

*“I don’t believe in that shit either. You’ve lived here for how long, though? Almost four years now?”*

*“Yeah. What about it?”*

*“Have you heard of anything like this happening before?”*

*“...No. Doesn’t mean some drunk moron or homeless guy wasn’t trying to get warm, though. It’s been pretty damn cold—more than the usual winters are.”*

*“I guess...”*

*“Well, regardless—what’s done is done. Besides your nose, nothing else bad happened to you, yeah?”*

*“My leg got fucked up a little, but you’re right. They didn’t steal anything I had with me, at least.”*

*“There you go,”* David said, pointing his fork at James. *“Positive reflection—or whatever the hell the shrinks call it. Does wonders.”*

James watched the steam slowly rise from his depleting coffee, ruminating over what David had told him. It didn’t bring him much comfort to think that what had happened was the result of his own brain running off the rails; on the other hand, the thought of someone truly breaking into his room as he slept was just as chilling.

He decided to leave those thoughts by the wayside, asking David a question to lighten his own mood.  
  
*“So... what’s the plan for after we leave, David?”*

*“Well, I can take you to the house to meet Rebecca—she’s been wanting to meet you ever since I told her that you were heading up here. After that, maybe we can go hunting down at Cedarfield if you want. It’s that stretch of woods you probably passed on your way here.”*

*“I don’t think I’m in good shape today for something like hunting, if I’m being honest.”*

*“Shit, I forgot about that. You slept like what—three hours at most? Damn... well, in that case, maybe you’d like to check out the shop I have? It’s not too far away; just between Cedarcrest and Ashleighville.”*

*“Sure thing, man. I’m interested to see what you’ve got going on.”*

After paying for both meals, David left the diner with James in tow. They brushed through the short piles of snow back to the former’s car, the morning sun now rising higher above their heads.

*“The work’s nothing too crazy,”* David said, continuing the conversation as they got back in the car again. *“People like to fish and raft around a lot in the lakes around here, so I mostly deal with small craft. The real boating work usually comes from the state government renovating their boats, or people from nearby counties looking for deals.”*

*“You get offers from the state for boating work? How did that happen?”*

*“Well, it wasn’t a good start, I can tell you that. There was a kid who up and went missing in Schenectady not long after I got the business up and running. Some guys from the state came to me, said they wanted to get their search boats up and running to look through the Mohawk.”*

*“Did they ever find the kid?”*

*“...Nope. It was a sad thing, all around. The locals say it reminded them of the crap that happened right here in Cedarcrest a few years back.”*

*“What are you talking about?”* James asked.

*“...Wait, what? The Lakeview Skinner, dude—you don’t know anything about him?”*

*“I have no idea who the hell that is, man.”*

David let out a brief whistle of surprise at James’s genuine confusion.

*“Really? Even my parents knew about that shit when they were all the way down in Georgia. It was all over the news back then! I’d just be doing the story wrong by telling you about it myself. You should hear it from someone who lived through it. My wife was right in town when all that horrible shit went down.”*

*“The hell?”*

*“Yeah, man, it was batshit insane. Not a lot of people here like bringing it up, and I don’t blame them. Besides Rebecca, I suggest you don’t bring it up with anyone else. You’ll just be seen as one of those kinds of tourists, if you know what I mean. We get those sometimes. Kids who want a tour of all the places where the bad shit happened...”*

*“Alright.”*

As they made their way to David’s home, lying east of Cedarcrest’s town center, they spotted soft clouds of white puffing up from the road ahead. With each passing second, they drew closer—soon spotting the first in a line of cars traveling in the opposite lane.

A white Crown Victoria adorned with the livery of the Atkins County Sheriff’s Office flew by, followed by a similarly white van marked with the letters **“CIU”** across its sides. Behind this large vehicle was another Crown Vic, sputtering snow across portions of David’s windshield in its feverish rush to keep up with the others. All three vehicles sped westward, sirens and lights ablaze.

*“What the hell!? Wow,”* David shouted, annoyed as he engaged the windshield wipers. *“Assholes are really in a rush today, huh?”*

*“What gives?”* James asked, peering at the small convoy as it disappeared into a thicket of trees, rounding a curve in the road behind them.

*“Maybe they found that hooligan of yours trying to break into someplace new. Watch it be some bum from New York City—or maybe even Buffalo. I’d put ten bucks on it.”*

James didn’t respond, lost in silent thought. Even though David was clearly joking, a nagging feeling wormed its way deep into James’s stomach, tugging at his mind. He was safe now, that much was true. He still felt no real sense of closure.

He regretted the yearning in his heart to know the truth of last night. From the deepest pit of his soul, a whisper told him it was something he could never bear to speak aloud as fact.",3,1753273181.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Friday, July 18 – EPCOT & Test Track Preview

Drove from South Florida (about 3.25 hours with 1 stop) to Pop Century where we waited in the lobby to join Test Track Passholder preview VQ at 1pm. Callback for 4:40pm was pretty much on target. This was my first-ever Passholder preview ride, which was exciting. Room was ready and we got room  #319 Building 10, 70’s. It was an adjoining room, not our favorite, but only one night and no complaints. Freshened up, reapplied sunscreen, and headed to EPCOT via Skyliner. It was about 90 degrees and the Skyliner temperature was fine with a decent breeze as long as you are moving. Not moving = very warm.

EPCOT - My brother got flagged for security with no idea what set it off. They were quick and pleasant. We stopped at Joffery's near the United Kingdom to get the Passholder Heart of Paris Cold Brew coffee and we split it (Yum!) on our way to the Land for lunch. Pro tip - Sunshine Seasons is a great place for an air conditioned lunch that usually has seating. The Hot Roast Beef with Fried Onions, Arugula, and Horseradish Cream Sauce on Sourdough Bread was hearty and delicious, despite some chewy pieces. 

Went to check if Geo-82 had a walk up and they did not, we kept checking the app, but never saw availability pop up. Rode Spaceship Earth since it had a short, shady wait and I hadn't ridden it in years. We thanked the Phoenicians.

Headed to Connections to get the Maleficent Passholder magnet. I can’t believe how giddy I was when I saw it in person. If it is wrong to plan a whole trip around a magnet, I don't want to be right. I also bought the blue EPCOT Passholder T-shirt with Figment on the back. It was $23, a pretty good deal!  I liked it because it didn't have the year on it. Note- I bought the medium since it was 100% cotton and I figured it would shrink, it did, but in a way that made the collar look sort of weird. I’ll still wear it though.

Killed some time getting Photopass pics. I bought it for the first time for a big family trip in November so I wanted to take advantage. We only went to photographers with no wait. 

Test Track (no spoilers) was cool and definitely an improvement from the last iteration, I especially love the new cars. There are some cute nods to previous versions. I would still do this as a single rider in the future unless I was with someone who had never been on it before.

Cosmic Rewind’s line had dropped to 80 minutes (75 appears to be the average). It is my favorite ride and the line quickly moved from outside to inside. I don't mind waiting in the AC on a hot day and it also gave me a chance to start this Trip Report. Got in line at 5:25pm and were in the Epcotian preshow room by 6:35pm. The preshow was broken with no video at all. The second room was working fine. People were rushing the doors and we hung back to hear about cake and toast. We got the first row without asking. (Song = I Ran).

Did the walk up bar for Space 220 with no wait. I definitely recommend the sliders and the deviled eggs. The shrimp tacos were meh. 

On our way out we walked past the Test Track line again and they were letting Passholders on without reservations. The wait was 45 minutes so we decided to pass and Skylinered over to Hollywood Studios. The first Fantasmic was cancelled due to weather so we had to swim upstream on our way to Tower of Terror (stick to the left). The line was 40 minutes, but quickly grew longer. We left to go back to the hotel when the second Fantasmic was still going so the Skyliner was empty.

Saturday, July 19 – Cosmic Rewind Failure = Hollywood Studios Breakfast

We secured the 7am VQ for Test Track with an estimated callback in 365 minutes. We were called back at 2:05pm. We decided to rope drop Cosmic Rewind, but it had a failure to launch. I had been checking Cosmic Rewind in the mornings before the trip and had noticed that there was a trend of failure to launch. We decided not to wait and pivoted to Hollywood Studios for breakfast Ronto Wraps from Ronto Roasters, which was something I had never done before. It is a hearty and delicious  breakfast. Pro tip - You can sit in the AC in the part of Docking Bay 7 that is just off the patio. Shh, it's a secret!

We rode Star Tours on the way to the new Villains show. After that, we split the Under the Sea Passholder iced coffee from the Joffery’s near ToT. They forgot the purple sprinkles, oh well. Keeping on theme, we went to the new Little Mermaid show. Both shows had great effects and acting and are nice AC breaks. 

Skylinered back to EPCOT and stopped off at Remy to do single rider. My brother and another single rider switched places so he could be in the same car with me and she could be in the same car with her single rider pal. Killed time waiting for the Test Track VQ by drinking ice water in Odyssey and then sampling sodas at Club Cool. Russian Cucumber Sprite is still my fave! Test Track preview line was longer than the day before, but it moved at a good pace. 

Thoughts/Observations:  

* I should not have broken my rule to not go in June, July or August…but the Maleficent Magnet had a strong pull. 
* It was nice to be in EPCOT at a non festival time, crowds were lower and there were no obvious drunken shenanigans.  
* The only “bad” guest behavior was in the Cosmic rewind pre-show rooms. There were the usual oblivious people stopped in a doorway or wherever blocking others, but no big deal. 
* Cast Members were fine, neither rude or especially compliment worthy, just doing their best in the hot/humid weather.
* My unrealistic magical wish: a fast, air-conditioned way to get from the front to the back of EPCOT. The Friendship boats are the closest thing, but they do not always run and can get very hot during the summer.

Chapter 1

Jul 4, 2025

POV Floris

Some asshole in a trench coat body-checked me at Schiphol without even a ""sorry,"" and honestly? Perfect fucking metaphor for how this whole Amsterdam adventure was shaping up.

""Sure, no worries,"" I muttered, wrestling my vindictive suitcase out of a tile crack while passengers flowed around me like I was human furniture. ""Love getting steamrolled by strangers. Really sets the mood for international career opportunities.""

The airport was chaos in corporate form—gleaming surfaces and people pretending their lives weren't falling apart.

Meanwhile, I stood there looking like a refugee from Silicon Valley's unemployment line: coat three seasons expired, boots that survived an actual flood, hair held together by spite and bobby pins.

Five feet of pure sarcasm wrapped in desperation, amber eyes that had seen too much tech industry bullshit, mouth that couldn't stay shut about it.

Yeah, that's me—Floris Middleton, MIT grad turned persona non grata, desperate enough to flee to a city where people bike in business suits like it's normal and everyone speaks better English than half of America.

Also, apparently, the only goddamn place left that would hire a blacklisted cybersecurity analyst with a history of making Very Important People very, very angry.

""Floris Middleton?"" I spun around and nearly face-planted into my luggage.

Corporate Clone Barbie stood there—black trench coat, zero expressions, clipboard weaponized. Name tag: Juno, Recruiter: Lynx Solutions.

""Uh, yeah. That's me.""

""You're late.""

""I'm literally not though."" Words popped out before I could filter them. ""My phone says 10:47, flight landed on time—""

""You're late,"" she repeated, like she could bend spacetime through administrative bitchiness. “Follow me.”

Great. Twenty seconds in Amsterdam and already failing at existence.

The town car was stupidly expensive—leather seats worth more than my whole education. I pressed against the window, watching Amsterdam blur past in expensive grays and browns and suspicious neon that looked like legalized vice advertising itself.

""About this job placement—"" I started.

""There's been a change,"" Juno interrupted, not looking up from her tablet. ""The original position was filled this morning.""

My stomach cratered. ""What? But the TechFlow data analyst role—we had a signed agreement—""

""One position remains. Brighton Systems. Executive assistant.""

I blinked hard. ""You're trying to make me a secretary for a surveillance mogul?""

""Executive assistant,"" she corrected with precision suggesting she'd had this conversation before. ""Excellent pay. Full benefits. Housing provided.""

""I have a master's degree in cybersecurity from MIT. I designed encryption protocols that the NSA still can't crack. I am not someone's coffee-fetching, calendar-managing assistant.""

Juno finally looked at me, expression warm as a tax audit. ""As I know, your brother's medical debt. $84,000. Experimental treatment he needs? $5,000 monthly. No insurance coverage.""

Ice water to the nervous system. I shut up.

""Brighton Systems offers comprehensive healthcare for employees' immediate family. Retroactive coverage, pre-existing conditions. No caps, no limitations.""

My resolve cracked like cheap drywall. ""What's the catch?""

""No catch. Sign a preliminary agreement, complete the interview process, your brother's treatment begins immediately.""

She handed me a tablet. Contract loaded, cursor blinking like a digital heartbeat.

""Don't Google him,"" she added, almost casual.

The second Juno left me in their psychotic minimalist lobby, I whipped out my phone and Googled the shit out of Eric Brighton.

Corporate espionage allegations. Whistleblower lawsuits. Ex-employees with NDAs thicker than textbooks. One charming headline: ""The Iceman Cometh: Why Eric Brighton's Employees Don't Last Six Months.""

My hands shook scrolling through digital horror stories.

This was career suicide. Exactly the toxic corporate nightmare I'd spent three years escaping after the whistleblowing debacle at Nexus Tech left me unemployable, blacklisted, and emotionally destroyed.

But Jake's face flashed through my mind. My little brother, fighting leukemia like his full-time job. Who'd put himself through community college while I lived my best academic life at MIT, never asking for help.

Never asked for anything, never complained, called me crying last month because insurance denied the bone marrow transplant that could literally save his life.

When Juno returned with a finalized contract, I signed without reading a word.

Because sometimes you don't choose between good and bad options. Sometimes you choose which version of hell you can survive.

Brighton Systems occupied twelve floors of architectural intimidation in Amsterdam's financial district. The building looked like liquid obsidian—black glass and sharp angles designed to make visitors feel disposable.

The receptionist had no eyebrows and wore latex like business casual. She didn't speak, just scanned my retina with something that looked surgical.

Beep. Access granted.

The executive floor was sensory deprivation meets evil lair. No furniture, no art, no human habitation signs. Just surveillance monitors showing real-time global feeds—London traffic, Tokyo subways, maybe a drug deal in São Paulo.

Standing before it all like a digital emperor: Eric Brighton.

No shoes. Charcoal suit worth more than my car. Dark hair perfectly disheveled like he'd run hands through it once.

He didn't turn when I entered.

""Miss Middleton. You're late.""

""Actually—"" He turned and with that I forgot how to form words.

Photos hadn't prepared me. Museum-quality bone structure, pale skin, sharp cheekbones, mouth that had never smiled. Steel-gray eyes like arctic water.

This man looked like he ordered deaths between meals.

""I'm not late,"" I managed.

""Then your phone is lying."" He moved closer—expensive cologne mixed with danger. ""What exactly did you think you were applying for?""

""Executive assistant. Administrative support, scheduling—""

""Wrong."" He circled me like a predator. ""You're here because you have specific skills I require. Because you've proven you'll sacrifice everything for what you believe is right. And because your brother is dying.""

My breath caught. ""How—?""

""I know everything, Floris. MIT summa cum laude. Phantom Protocol encryption at twenty-four. Exposed Nexus Tech's illegal surveillance of federal judges, got yourself blacklisted from every major tech company.""

He stopped in front of me. ""Now you're desperate enough to work for someone like me.""

""Someone like you?""

""Someone you Googled despite explicit instructions. Someone whose reputation terrifies you. Someone you believe is capable of terrible things."" His smile could cut glass. ""You're not wrong.""

He walked to his desk. ""Your real job isn't assistant work. It's a security analysis. Corporate espionage prevention. Finding holes in my system before enemies do.""

""And if I refuse?""

""Your brother's treatment stops. His debt gets sold to collection agencies run by creative people. You get deported, unemployable for life.""

The room shrank. ""You're blackmailing me.""

""I'm offering a choice. Work for me, protect my interests, your brother lives. Refuse, and you both learn what desperation feels like.""

""Why me? Hundreds of security analysts don't have my baggage.""

""Baggage creates loyalty. Desperate people work harder. You've proven you'll destroy your life to expose the truth."" He leaned against his desk. ""I respect that. I can use that.""

""What happens when you're done using me?""

""Depends how useful you prove.""

The monitors flickered. Hospital room. My heart stopped.

Jake. Asleep, connected to machines, but peaceful. For the first time in months he looked peaceful.

""He looks well,"" Eric observed. ""New treatment's working. White cell count improved dramatically.""

""You already started treating him?""

""Insurance authorized this morning. Funny how quickly things process when you know the right people."" Relief and rage tangled in my chest. ""Do we have understanding?""

I looked at Jake's face, then back at the man holding our lives. ""What's my first assignment?""

His smile was winter. ""Get on your knees.""

I froze. ""Excuse me?""

""Rule one: everyone starts at the bottom. Everyone learns humility first."" He gestured to the floor. ""Kneel.""

""I'm not— This isn't—""

""Your brother's next treatment is Friday. Would be unfortunate if there were authorization complications.""

My legs turned to water. This was insane, degrading, exactly the power-trip bullshit I'd sworn I'd never tolerate again. Every feminist instinct I had was screaming at me to walk out, to tell this psychopath exactly where he could shove his job offer.

But Jake's face was on that screen, peaceful for the first time in months. And sometimes survival means swallowing your pride along with everything else you thought you knew about yourself.

I sank to my knees on cold marble.

“Good girl,” Eric said softly. “Now we can begin. You will do whatever I say. Because I’m the only one keeping your brother alive.”

1m77nvn,https://i.redd.it/s5cvulns8mef1.jpeg,Review: The Difference Foundation Kentucky Straight Bourbon,"The Difference Kentucky Straight Bourbon

Chapter 1: The Foundation

Accolades: Double Gold at 2025 San Francisco World Spirits Competition 

Exclusively for members of The Shareholders Society

Contract distilled by Bardstown Bourbon Co. for another client 

Mashbill: 73% corn, 19% rye, 8% malted barley 

 Age: 5 years 3 months 

Batch size: 7 barrels

Barrel manufacturer: Independent Stave Co.

Barrel char: 3

Barrel entry proof: 120

Full cask strength: around 124 proof

Bottling proof: 108.24 

Price: Membership in The Shareholder Society. I have no idea what the membership price is, but based on the website and the fact that it’s apparently access to allegedly very influential people, I’m sure it’s way more expensive than I would ever dream of paying. With membership, they send you bottles of The Difference.

Nose 👃: Coconut macaroon. Toasted almond. Sandalwood. Orange marmalade.

Palate 👅: Dark brown sugar. Dried apricot. Black walnut. Light coffee. Ridiculously thick mouthfeel.

Finish 🏁: Light coffee. Butterscotch. Dried apricot.

I didn’t want to like this, but I really do. I don’t like the fact that the brand’s website gives virtually no information about the actual whiskey, but when I asked… they happily provided all of the details. The website is almost exclusively about being a “business bourbon” and the connections you get with The Shareholders Society. I appreciate the fact that they openly gave me all of the details about the bourbon, but it definitely turned me off in advance that none of those details were publicly available.

The mouthfeel is absurdly oily… and I love it!  The mashbill is the same construct as Hard Truth’s BW1 and Old Glory.  Prior to Hard Truth releasing their own Indiana bourbon, they had Wilderness Trail distill BW1. Old Glory in Clarksville Tennessee also uses the same mash for their own bourbon. Bardstown Bourbon Co. also clearly did a fantastic job with it for The Difference. The Difference barrels were distilled for another client, but I don’t know who that other client is.

I really like this bourbon… considering the age statement, it’s pretty fantastic. With that said, I have zero interest in actually joining The Shareholders Society at a premium cost in order to get future expressions.

Bottle provided for review by the brand.

Rating: 7 | Great | Well above average
