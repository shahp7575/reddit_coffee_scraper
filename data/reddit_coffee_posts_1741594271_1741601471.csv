Dopo aver finito, prende il telefono e controlla l’indirizzo del suo alloggio. Cammina per cinque minuti e arriva davanti a un grande portone. Cerca le istruzioni sul telefono e trova il codice per aprire la porta. Entra, prende l’ascensore e arriva alla sua stanza. Apre la porta e sorride: è stanco, ma felice di essere arrivato!

Recently been going through a data recovery process with a Toshiba Canvio Ready. It had been dropped from a coffee table accidentally and was making clicking noises. I brought it to a data recovery specialist and have had it in the shop since. Computer Forensics Lab in London, as recommended by a couple threads here.

  
Last week, I received the below email:

'As you are aware, we have successfully completed the head swap. However, for some reason, the HDD keeps hanging, and when we attempt imaging, the drive crashes. We have to wait for a while before trying to read the data from the disks again.'

Then last Friday, this:

""I'm afraid the HDD is still hanging. We are trying to disable EARR, but if it doesn't work, we won't be able to recover any data.""

A couple things: 1) Would anyone be able to translate this to layman's terms as to what the issue seems to be with the hard drive, and 2) what are the likely chances of getting any data recovered, with this company or if I choose to take the hard drive to another company after. 

I know I should've backed everything up, but as usual I was a bit stupid, just trying to set some realistic expectations for myself now.

1j7uv4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1j7uv4x/i_27m_had_sex_with_an_ex_i_dated_in_college/,I (27M) had Sex with an ex i dated in college.,"Hi All,

I was working in one of the companies in Bangalore. One day in the Orion Mall shopping center, I noticed a quite familiar girl. She looked like Shruti, my ex gf from college. She was a Telugu girl from Andhra Pradesh. At first, I was not sure if I was right. But when I went close and checked, it was indeed Shruti, to my surprise.

Shruti was my Senior and I had crush on her right from the first day I saw her in college. It took a while for her to realise that I was crazy for her. Long story short - Shruti and I were college sweethearts, everyone in college knew about our affair and were in a relationship for 5 years. But college relationships are not meant to last, right? We had to split because of parental pressure. Shruti was 2 years my senior in college and was from an extremely traditional middle class family.

I met Shruti after 8 years. I am 28 now, and Shruti is 30. I'm still single but Shruti is married. Shruti's husband works in a government job and was posted in Belgaum. So she has been in Bangalore (IT job) somewhat closer to Belgaum. I happened to work in Bangalore Electronic City on a short-term assignment when I bumped into her.

I was genuinely happy seeing her after so many years. Shruti hadn’t changed even a little in her looks. She was still the same traditional Indian housewife who wore a saree and was devoted to her family. We had cut off all contact after her marriage, and I had no idea how her life had been.

Me: Hi Shruti, so happy to see you. What are you doing here?

Shruti: Hmm, It's you. Oh happy to see you, too. I have been in Bangalore for a few years now. My husband is working in Belgaum. What are you doing here?

Me: I have come to Bangalore on a short-term assignment. How are you? Why don’t we have a coffee together if you are comfortable?

Shruti: Sure but some other time? I have to go and pick up my son from school. Let's do 1 thing. Why don’t you come to my home lunch tomorrow afternoon if you can?

Shruti messages me her address, and she left. Shruti was still the same, a straightforward conservative woman who lived by her principles. At 30, she looked beautiful and elegant and didn’t look older than 25. All my college memories came back.

How did we have dreams for our entire life and plan to get married? Everything was shattered as her parents didn’t approve of our relationship. Even though we were in a relationship for 5 years, we had never even kissed as she was conservative. However, I didn’t mind as our relationship was genuine.

I went to Shruti's home the next day on a Friday afternoon for lunch. Her son had gone to school, and her husband was working on another city Belgaum. We spoke about everything, from traffic in Bangalore, to covid to how our lives have changed in the past few years.

The rapport was still there, and we were comfortable in our conversations. Finally, I asked Shruti how her life was. At first, she said everything was fine. But being her boyfriend for 5 years, I knew everything was not fine. I sat next to her and asked her to tell the truth and not lie to me.

To tell me the truth as a friend. There were tears in her eyes. She said that even though her husband is a good person, she is unsure if he is faithful. She said she had heard a few stories about him from other people. I felt bad for Shruti as she is one of the most conservative and loyal girls I had known.

I felt bad for her and was not sure what to say. I tried to convince her that things would be better soon. Better sense would prevail once he realized how good she was. She started sobbing more as I tried to convince her. I was not sure what to do.

So I gently placed my hand reassuringly on her hand and told her everything will be fine. She told me she made a mistake listening to her parents. She should have gone against their wishes and married me. I told her that the past could not be changed, and she needed to look towards her future.

I tried consoling her to lead her life and not get stuck in a relationship as it would take her nowhere. Knowingly or unknowingly, I placed her head on my shoulders. I caressed her head and put my hand around her shoulders. It took us a couple of seconds before we realized what had happened, and I apologized.

She said she was sorry too. It had been some time that someone had consoled her. She felt lonely in Bangalore, away from home. Though great in bed, her husband was never was there for her emotionally. All he gave her was sex but not emotional support.

I hugged her reassuringly and, in the heat of the moment, kissed her cheeks and then her lips. It was a gentle kiss on her tender lips, and I sucked her upper lips in the heat of the moment. Without realizing she too reciprocated by sucking my lower lips. I was kissing Shruti for the first time, and I saw her eyes so closely.

I told her I was sorry again. I asked her not to be guilty as her husband is no saint, and I stood up to leave. She said I was right and held my hand, stopping me from leaving. Once our eyes met, the old spark had kicked off. We felt that connection where both wanted each other at that moment.

Describing her, Shruti was 30 and had an hourglass figure with broad waists. My guess is her figure is approximately 34-24-34. She had long hair, which she always braided. She wore a bindi on her face and bangles on her hand. She had silver anklets on her feet.

She was fair with an elongated face and pointed lips. She had round breasts which sat high on her chest, which was fairly big 34C I guess. She had a broad waist and long legs, always covered either by saree or salwar kameez. She was a soft-spoken girl. Even at 30, Shruti looked the same, epitome of grace and beauty.

I was getting hot. I could sense that Shruti was breathing heavily and was getting warm. Shruti was wearing a blue silk saree with a matching blouse. Shruti was sitting next to me on the couch. I dragged her close to me and made her sit on my lap. I loosened her saree pallu, and she was in her blouse.

Her large voluptuous breasts looked good, and her cleavage was visible. She was wearing a white bra which was visible inside her blouse. I had never gotten so close to Shruti, and I was still not sure if I was doing the right thing. I held Shruti around her bare waist with my left hand and gently kissed Shruti's lips.

Me: I love you Shruti, I wish we could do this every day.

Shruti: Love you too, Rahul. Fate has chosen something else for us.

Me: Are you sure you want this today?

Shruti: Yes, baby. I can’t stop myself anymore. We deserve at least this.

I gently licked Shruti's cleavage. Her cleavage was seductive because of her blouse. It was a low-cut cotton blouse and had 2 hooks holding her large breasts. Her white bra was visible inside. It was a non-padded plunge bra that made her entire cleavage visible.

I slid my tongue in between them and gently licked it. I licked her upwards towards her neck from the bottom of the cleavage. With my left hand, I was caressing her back. With my right hand, I was caressing her waist. I kept licking her cleavage and neck and shoulders and moving up towards her lips.

Each time I sucked her lips, I gently kissed her nose and licked her eyes. I fondled her ears with the tip of my tongue. I wanted Shruti to feel loved and wanted. I unhooked her blouse, and I could see her white bra holding her breasts. It was a sight I had fantasized about so many times in college.

I removed her blouse and my T-Shirt and poured some honey (that I took from the Dinning table) on Shruti's cleavage on top of her bra. This made it juicy and tasty. I gently kept sucking her sweet honey-laden breasts. Each time I sucked her breasts, Shruti held my head tightly. She pulled me towards her, giving out a gentle moan.

I asked her if she liked it. She told me that her husband only fu\*\*\*\* her hard but never made her body feel so good. She loves this. She gently kissed my head while sucking the honey from her breasts. Shruti was still in her saree below her waist.

I quickly unwrapped it, and she was on her petticoat and bra by now. We moved to her bedroom, where she unzipped my jeans. I pulled the lace off her petticoat. Finally, Shruti and I were in our innerwear. I already had an erection.

Me: Love you, baby. I am living my dream. I am happy I am finally able to share my love with you.

Shruti: Same here, baby. Love you too. You make me feel so good and wanted. Love you to the moon and never back.

Me: (Playfully) What if your husband comes home now?

Shruti: (Playfully) You have to jump out of the window. Now don’t waste time and make love to me that you always wanted to.

Me: I haven’t started yet.

Shruti was in her red underwear and white bra. With many bangles on both of her hands, anklets on her ankles, a gold chain around her neck, and gold earrings. She looked very beautiful in her curvy figure. I knew Shruti deserved everything and had to give her my best.

Shruti had a huge mirror in her bedroom. I took Shruti to the mirror, and she was facing it. I was standing behind Shruti. I could see her face in the reflection. I could see her breasts in the reflection and her buttocks right in front of my eyes. Shruti was shy of me watching her.

I gently hugged her from behind. I unhooked her bra and kissed her back. I could see her breasts dangling in the reflection. I started licking her bareback from behind and was cupping her breasts. I could see Shruti's expression in the mirror. She had closed her eyes and moaned gently.

I played on her back with the tip of my tongue and circled her nipples with my fingers. I asked Shruti if she liked it. Shruti replied, “Please continue, darling.”

I gently put my hands on her buttocks, squeezed them, and pulled her red underwear down. I could see her vagina in the mirror and her buttocks right in front of my eyes. I kissed her neck slowly. With my left hand, I tried to squeeze her breasts.

With my right hand, I slowly rubbed her vaginal lip. She gave out a loud moan. I could feel it getting wet. I could feel her body shivering and her heart pounding. Both of our bodies were tightly clinging to each other, and I could see us in the mirror intertwined.

Me: Shruti, are you sure? Do you want to do this? I don’t want you to regret it later because you know you are married now.

Shruti: Yes, baby. Please make love to me. I have never been touched the way you touched me. I like it.

I slowly entered my erect penis from behind to her vagina. Shruti gave out a gentle moan and bent a little. I hugged her from behind and cupped both of her breasts from behind. I circled her nipples and kept kissing and licking her back and neck during each penetration.

I could see Shruti's reflection in the mirror. I could see my hands on her breasts and my penis entering her in the reflection. She kept moaning, and I asked her if she liked it. She closed her eyes and nodded yes, and tried to pull me forward with her hands.

I continued this for a few more strokes, getting faster. Shruti was properly lubricated. The room was filled with our moans and the sound of me entering her, and the bangles dangling in her hand. My strokes were getting faster. Shruti and I made eye contact and looked at each other in the mirror.

Both my hands were on her nipples and my face next to her, hugging her tightly from behind. Finally, I ejaculated inside her. I apologized for ejaculating inside her, and she said it’s okay as she knows her dates and she will take care of it. We both were breathing heavily now and sat on the bed.

Shruti gently kissed me on my cheek. I reciprocated by kissing her forehead and whispering, “I love you, baby,” in her ears. It was 2pm now, and yet to have our lunch. We decided to take a quick shower. Shruti and I went to the bathroom, and both of us stood under the shower.

The hot water was pouring over our heads. Shruti's long hair was wet and looked more beautiful. I pulled Shruti close to me and kissed her lips. We smooched under the hot water, and we kissed each other. She was moving her hands over my back.

I held her buttocks and squeezed them each time she kissed me. I took her fingers and sucked her fingertips. I kissed her wrists on her bangles and licked her palm, and sucked her armpits. I was erect again and told Shruti that I wanted to enter her again.

Shruti smiled and said she would love that too, and she never had s\*\* under the shower. I knelt, and water dripped over Shruti's vagina like a gentle waterfall. I gently sucked the water dripping from her vagina and rapidly flipped my tongue on her clit. Shruti moaned loudly and held my head tightly. The water was flowing over us. I then stood up and gently pushed Shruti against the wall and penetrated her. It was fairly easy by now, and I stroked her under the water. Shruti kept giving out moans and whispering my name while I penetrated her.

I had my hands around her buttocks and gave everything I had for one last time. After a few strokes, roughly 5 minutes, I finally ejaculated once again inside her. Shruti gave out a loud moan as well, and I knew she had reached an orgasm.

We stood under the shower for a minute and let the hot water run over our bodies. Shruti then knelt and held my penis in her hand and gently kissed it. We applied soap on each other and cleaned ourselves. We took a shower together, dried each other, and dressed up.

We both were exhausted and slept in each other’s arms for an hour. We finally had lunch together. Before her son was back from school, I bid her goodbye. Shruti had tears in her eyes. I asked her if she was regretting whatever had happened.

She said she would never regret and loved every moment of it. She was only sad that we had to meet this way. I planted a kiss on her forehead and told her that I would always love her, and I left.

But now we have been in long distance for almost the entire past year since we're in different colleges. In college, I made a great friend group, all girls. There are some guy friends too but I dont regularly spend time with them or hang out with them regularly. 
My bf on the other hand, spends a lot of time with the girls at his college. He plays games with them, bunks lectures with them, goes out for coffee or tea with them, goes to movies with them. I didn't have much of a problem with this, until

One night, I asked him to be home early the next day so we could play his favourite game together. He told me he'd definitely be home on time (1 pm was the original timing). I expected he'd be home by 2 and even if he wasnt, he'd at least inform me.
I called him at 1 to ask him what he's doing, he told me he was helping his female friend (lets say T) complete her assignment. I was caught a bit off guard but I brushed it off. Then I waited for him till 2, then till 3, then till 4.
He came back at 5 pm. No texts, no ""I'll be late"", not even an apology.

I asked him why he was so late, he told me he forgot to text me that he was going out for lunch with his friends. He had originally told me he wouldn't wait around for lunch. I asked why, he said ""T wasn't going to come so we weren't gonna go, but I insisted her so she came along and I had to go"" 

This honestly broke me, but I forgave it. Its been 2 months since this incident but I cannot stop being insecure. I can't stop overthinking. I feel like he put someone else over me. I mean, he could've at least informed me right? 
Shouldnt a couple in long distance relationship have some more boundaries than one in a normal relationship?
I feel extremely conflicted and don't know how to deal with my feelings right now.
I would appreciate it if someone gave me a perspective from a fresh angle.

TLDR: My bf was late for 4 hrs and didn't inform me while I was waiting for him, only to tell me he was busy with his female friends.",2,1741598331.0,RelationshipIndia,9,1.0,False

Please give me some advice: I intend to spend about a week in Cambodia - will be longer in HCMC, so I am planning a trip from there to Phnom Penh and back.

b) is it possible to sail the whole way? Where to sleep if it is more comfortable for two days?

c) book accommodation in PP via booking Agoda etc. or directly on site?

d) how long does it take to get an e-visa online and is it easier upon arrival?

e) what about cards in Cambodia (Revolut?) or do I need cash?

... I know: a lot of questions.

Not morbidly but close. Every morning I brush my teeth and my tongue and it makes me gag. Why not lean into it and throw up whatever I ate the night before? That my body didn’t digest for hours apparently. I haven’t done it yet. I’ve been trying to lose weight over a year now. I walk 3 miles a day, compared to the zero before. I haven’t lost any weight in AN ENTIRE FUCKING YEAR and I’m feeling so defeated. I still walk no matter what, for my heart health, but I’ve given up thinking it’ll help me lose weight. I don’t eat crazy either. I use dinnerly, but sometimes I’m still hungry so I eat the leftovers, and it ended up being too much for the day, plus whatever I ate for lunch. Once a month, I get a craving and order a burrito, and it undoes all my progress FOR THE WHOLE MONTH. Amazing how only one meal can make you gain so much. Anyway I’m at the edge now and feeling so hopeless. I can’t magically not be hungry, sorry to the fat people haters that will just tell me to put down the fork. I probably eat less than you.

1j7uc3h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j7uc3h,Plastic Tamper No More,"I finally gave in and bought a quality tamper for my Flair Neo. I had a choice between one with a teak handle and one with a burl teak handle. If I really known how stunning these tamper are I might have opted for the latter. They are made and sold out of Indonesia by Ipok Tala. The shocker was the weight. At a fifth of a kilogram, this thing is a beast. I might even use it for a meat pounder. 😂

I considered the Flair tamper but for 19¢ less I couldn't see choosing a plastic handle over wood. At today's exchange rate, the Flair model sells here for $31.25, the one I bought I paid $31.44, and the burl teak model is $33.76. From what I've read the Flair tamper is 39.25mm and mine is 39.45mm. Not a lot but the main reason I decided to dump the plastic cup/tamper is the ring of coffee that was being left pushed against the PF wall.

Irritable with my wife, hating all people I meet and my friends. Saying asshole things just to get a rise out of people, enjoying others' misery. 

I don't and didn't have conventional depression. Pre-Zoloft I had things I enjoyed and loved and always had affection for my wife despite being a prick. I say that just to let you all know I wasn't depressed in the conventional way because I have had a bout of ""real depression"" in my youth 20 years ago and I know what that is. 

However last year I began to take Zoloft because I just wanted a change. I wanted something to kick me off of my curmudgeonly ways. And it was extraordinary. 

Now I'm no longer negative, hating people, saying things to be a prick, no longer impatient with my wife, and I'm just a pure sweetheart (as per my wife of 15 years which is the ultimate litmus). I'm kind to my wife's friends and our friends and they all have noticed and told her. Hell, I even make small talk with strangers now and enjoy getting people I don't know to smile - I used to HATE small talk and talking with the barista when getting my coffee.

I feel so bad about forcing my wife to live with my self when I was such a miserable asshole for so many years. It didn't need to be. Also she is menopausal and I am perfectly able to weather her emotional storms without issue and she loves it and is grateful for it. I don't think I'm a different person on Zoloft, I think I'm my best self on Zoloft.

I made this post because recently my mother in law told us about their friend (who was pretty much my wife's uncle and family) who is the biggest miserable asshole and he has completely changed due to starting some course of anti depressants. 

Do you have a miserable prick in your life? Suggest anti depressants. 

PS I had issues with sleepiness and cumming for the first few months and I started taking Wellbutrin with Zoloft and it fixed those issues. Be careful of taking too high a dose of Wellbutrin though, because it made me rage. ",5,1741597054.0,zoloft,0,0.86,False

Episode 2 Script: Introducing lead actress  Radhika
Scene : Leaving the Therapy Session – Mitesh and Rudra’s Conversation

(Mitesh leans casually against his car as Rudra exits the therapist’s office. He watches him closely before smirking.)

MITESH (grinning):
So, how was it? More deep, life-changing realizations?

RUDRA (shrugging, smirking slightly):
She said I deserve happiness.

MITESH (serious for a second, then nods with a smile):
You definitely do, man.

(Just as he says this, they stop at a red light, and Radhika appears on the side of the road. She’s trying to grab a falling ice cream cone while simultaneously adjusting her bag and talking animatedly on the phone. She drops her phone, gasps dramatically, and quickly bends down to pick it up, bumping into a passerby in the process. The person glares at her, and she gives them an apologetic, sheepish grin.)

MITESH (watching her antics, laughing softly):
Speaking of happiness… you need someone like that. Full of life, funny, someone who can actually make you enjoy things.

RUDRA (scowling, unimpressed):
I can’t handle silly girls.

MITESH (laughing, amused):
Oh, you think you can’t.

(Mitesh smirks to himself, knowing full well that Rudra has no idea this ‘silly girl’ is about to become part of his daily life. He wonders how she even managed to impress Rudra in the interview.)

Scene : Next Day – Radhika’s Grand Entrance

(Radhika rushes into the office building, clearly late. She clutches her bag, trying to juggle files, her ID card, and a coffee cup all at once. She sprints towards the elevator but, in her hurry, doesn’t notice Rudra walking towards the lobby.)

RUDRA (checking his watch, walking briskly):
(muttering) People can’t even be punctual—

(Before he can finish, Radhika crashes into him, spilling a few drops of coffee on his sleeve. He stiffens immediately, his jaw tightening.)

RADHIKA (gasping):
Oh no! Sir, I—I mean—Mr.Rudra Mehra! I’m so sorry! First-day jitters, you know how it is!

RUDRA (coldly, wiping his sleeve):
Clearly, you don’t. First-day jitters don’t justify being late. My office. Now.

(Radhika winces as Rudra storms off. She mutters to herself, trying to psych herself up before heading to his office.)

Scene : Rudra’s Office – The Lecture

(Radhika stands awkwardly in front of Rudra’s desk while he leans back in his chair, arms crossed, his expression unreadable.)

RUDRA (firmly):
So, Ms. Sharma, this is how you start your job? Late on your first day?

RADHIKA (nervous, trying to lighten the mood):
Technically, I was almost on time. Just… you know, fate had other plans.

RUDRA (raising an eyebrow, unimpressed):
I don’t run my business on ‘fate.’ If you want to work here, punctuality is non-negotiable.

RADHIKA (nodding quickly):
Understood, sir! Lesson learned. I will be ridiculously early from tomorrow. So early, I might have to sleep in the office!

(Rudra stares at her, not sure if she’s being sarcastic or serious. Before he can respond, Mitesh walks in.)

Scene : The Big Reveal

(Mitesh enters Rudra’s office just as Radhika leaves. He watches Rudra rub his temples in frustration.)

MITESH (grinning):
What’s with the face?

RUDRA (exasperated, pointing at the door where Radhika just left):
She was late on her first day. How did I even select someone this careless?

MITESH (grinning mischievously):
Oh, I was wondering the same thing yesterday when you said you can’t handle silly girls.

RUDRA (frowning, confused):
What?

MITESH (grinning wider, enjoying this moment):
The girl we saw yesterday—the one you said was too silly? That was Radhika.

(Rudra’s eyes widen slightly. He leans back, thinking about how she had seemed mature and composed during her interview.)

RUDRA (in disbelief):
She seemed serious when I interviewed her…

MITESH (laughing, shaking his head):
Oh, she can be serious—when she wants to be. But that’s not all she is. She’s talented, man. Just… different from what you’re used to.

RUDRA (muttering, still shocked):
Unbelievable.

MITESH (smirking as he pats Rudra’s shoulder before leaving):
This is going to be fun.

(Rudra watches him leave, exhaling deeply. He has no idea how he ended up hiring someone like her—but something tells him, his life is about to get a lot more chaotic.)

Some chaotic moments 


Scene 1: Radhika’s First Major Work Mistake

(Radhika is supposed to send an important project report to a client but accidentally attaches the wrong file—a meme she saved instead of the actual document.)

RUDRA (checking his email, suddenly freezing, then glaring at Radhika):
Ms. Sharma… what is this?

RADHIKA (nervous, peeking at his laptop):
Oh! That’s a very motivational meme, sir. See, it says ‘Success is like a sandwich. The more effort you put in, the better it tastes!’

RUDRA (pinching the bridge of his nose, exasperated):
I do not need life lessons from a sandwich. Why did you send this to the client?!

RADHIKA (grinning sheepishly):
Well… at least it’s inspiring?

RUDRA (sternly, crossing his arms):
Fix it. Now.

RADHIKA (saluting playfully):
Yes, sir! Consider it fixed!

(She rushes out, leaving Rudra shaking his head in disbelief.)


Scene 2: More Chaos – Radhika’s Silly Office Antics

(Radhika, trying to carry coffee, files, and her phone all at once, bumps into a filing cabinet, causing papers to fly everywhere.)

RUDRA (furious, stepping into the mess):
Ms. Sharma! Are you physically incapable of walking straight?!

RADHIKA (pouting):
Sir, I’m just multitasking! It’s an art!

RUDRA (deadpan):
It’s a disaster.

(Another day, Radhika accidentally presses the office speaker button while humming a Bollywood song, broadcasting it to the entire floor.)

RUDRA (gritting his teeth, storming into her cubicle):
Ms. Sharma, why is there a romantic song playing across the office?!

RADHIKA (gasping, quickly covering the speaker with her hands):
Oops… consider this office ambience?

RUDRA (warning tone):
One more mistake, and I’ll—

RADHIKA (nodding quickly):
Yes, yes, I know. You’ll fire me.

(She winks and rushes off before he can say anything else. Rudra exhales deeply, wondering why he hired her.)


Scene 3: Radhika’s Growth – The Big Presentation

(Over time, Radhika starts improving. She still has her fun personality, but she takes her work more seriously. Finally, she’s given the responsibility to present a marketing pitch in a board meeting.)

(As she speaks, Rudra watches in quiet surprise. She’s confident, well-prepared, and engaging.)

RUDRA (thinking to himself, impressed):
She’s… actually good.

(After the meeting, Rudra approaches her.)

RUDRA (clearing his throat, looking at her seriously):
Ms. Sharma. Good job.

RADHIKA (eyes widening in shock, dramatically clutching her chest):
Wait. Did you just… compliment me?

RUDRA (rolling his eyes, muttering):
Don’t make me regret it.

(Radhika grins, feeling proud.)


Scene 4: Rudra’s Unintentional Soft Spot for Radhika

(One evening, Radhika is in the breakroom, struggling to open a jammed coffee vending machine.)

RADHIKA (muttering, frustrated):
Ugh, why does life test me like this?

(Rudra, watching from afar, sighs and walks over. Without a word, he presses the right button, and the machine instantly works.)

RADHIKA (gasps, looking up at him like he’s a hero):
You have magical fingers!

RUDRA (raising an eyebrow):
It’s called reading the instructions, Ms. Sharma.

(Radhika laughs, and for the first time, Rudra finds himself smiling without realizing it.)

MITESH (passing by, whispering teasingly to Rudra):
You’re smiling. Because of her.

RUDRA (quickly wiping the smile away, clearing his throat):
No, I’m not.

(Mitesh smirks, knowing full well that Rudra is unknowingly growing fond of Radhika.)


Scene 5: The Beginning of Friendship

(Over time, their banter turns more friendly. Radhika continues to be a chaos magnet, but Rudra no longer finds her unbearable—he finds her endearing.)

(One day, Radhika is having a tough time, feeling frustrated with a project.)

RUDRA (walking over, setting a cup of coffee on her desk):
Here. You look like you need it.

RADHIKA (blinking in surprise):
You… brought me coffee? Voluntarily?

RUDRA (shrugging, looking away):
It’s just coffee. Don’t make a big deal out of it.

(Radhika smiles, realizing that beneath his tough exterior, Rudra actually cares.)

RADHIKA (grinning teasingly):
You’re not as scary as you pretend to be, sir.

RUDRA (raising an eyebrow):
And you’re not as hopeless as I thought, Ms. Sharma.

(They share a small, genuine smile—the beginning of an unexpected but growing friendship.)
This structure keeps their dynamic fun, evolving from frustration to admiration, leading to the start of their friendship.

I didn’t even put a price, just asked for offers, thinking, you know, people would throw reasonable numbers my way. Big mistake.

First offer: 20 CHF. I thought it was a typo. Nope. They were dead serious. I politely declined, and the guy just replied, “Good luck getting more for that garbage.”

Next up: 50 CHF and a smug “That’s all it’s worth.” Another guy told me I should be paying him to take it off my hands. Then someone else said I was a scammer for even trying to sell it at all. Like… what?

I know Switzerland is expensive, but damn, I didn’t expect electronics to depreciate faster than a used tissue here. I’ve checked Ricardo and other local sites, and I see people listing them for 150-250 CHF, depending on condition and accessories.

I have a Jura Z8 that had an excellent run so far with over 25000 cups since it was purchased in 2016.

Since about a week ago, I have issues that started with the coffee dripping very slowly: the pump was working, I would get a full cup but it would take easily 45s for an espresso and double that for a coffee. I opened the machine and cleaned the brewing group, the sieve was almost completely blocked, there was a big amount of coffee ""goo"" which was also accumulating in the hose that was going up from the brewing group toward the nozzles. After putting it back together, the problem was still present until a few cups later where the machine made a big pressure release noise while brewing a cup after which it started working normally again.

A couple of days later, problems started again, I had spare refurbished parts ready so I changed the entire brewing group, the big pump and the membrane regulator that's on top of it, I also inspected the hoses and everything looks good.

When I brew a cup, the grinder works normally, then the pump starts but it makes some kind of ""muffled"" sound for a few seconds, then the machine says ""system is filling"" I hear some pressured air being pushed out, and then the machine says ""enjoy your cup"" as if it had finished the preparation, then it delivers ground beans in the container.

There are few parts I haven't yet changed in the water circuit, any idea what my problem may be ? currently looking at the ceramic valves but thought I'd ask before buying

Edit: Non coffee water works perfectly fine but if I understand correctly, it uses a completely different circuit

1j7ty4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1j7ty4g/caught_my_neighbours_secret_morning_romance/,Caught My Neighbour’s Secret Morning Romance,"So, yesterday morning, I was sitting by my window, sipping on my coffee, when I noticed this guy standing outside my neighbor's house. He was pacing around, texting, and honestly acting kind of sketchy. I figured he was either lost or waiting for someone, but then I realized he seemed way too into it. Something was definitely up.

A few minutes later, I saw the girl—still in her pajamas and looking half asleep—walk out the front door. They started talking, and I thought, ""Okay, this is it."" They went inside the house, and I’m sitting there, peeking through the blinds, curious about what was going on.

Then, I saw them through the window. They started hugging, and not just a quick hug—it was one of those full-on, romantic hugs. I could see them leaning in, and before I knew it, they were kissing right there in the middle of the living room. I couldn’t help but just stare. It felt like I was watching a scene straight out of a movie, except... through my window.

But then—just as they were really getting into it—I heard a horn honk outside. I looked out and saw her little sister’s van pulling up. The guy immediately froze. I saw the panic on his face through the window, and he bolted upstairs to hide. I was dying laughing at this point. He looked like he was in a full-blown escape mission.

The girl quickly closed the door behind her and tried to act casual.

A few times I would be busy with work, it’s 20km away from the city where she works, so sometimes when I used to go to the city I used to find her there and give her a lift close to her home off the city whenever.

So the problem starts when I would think I’d go to the city and I would tell her since we chatted a lot, but would end up busy and not call her to meet up to give a lift. Sometimes I would be in the city and just say that i am or would be. She would wait for me somewhere thinking I’d pick her up, while it was not on my plans.

One day she got angry all of a sudden and I felt bad because i did not know she used to assume, so i offered to pay a taxi for her to go home. She refused saying she wanted me to pick her up. I did not because i was busy and would not return home anytime soon, and i told her multiple times.


The other day she gave me a laptop for me to fix. I fixed it and I asked if she really wanted the laptop on the same day or if I could give her the next day. The next day It would have been easier for me to give the laptop because i had a lot to do on the current day. She insisted she wanted on the current day. So I went to deliver a product to a client first after I left work. She started calling asking where I was, I told her i was delivering a product and she could meet me there so she could retrieve the laptop. She insisted I deliver and meet her at a spot 1km away from my delivery point. So after delivering the product I had a date with my girlfriend and I picked her up since it was in the same direction my friend was waiting. Together we give her the laptop and ask if she wanted a lift to the closest bus stop. She refused saying she wanted to get home fast, so she took the bus nearby.
After i get home i text my friend wanting to know hows the laptop and if she got home safe. She said she got robbed at the bus stop and they took her laptop. I felt bad for her and gave her strength. She responded saying it would not have happened if i told her i was busy that day. I got a little mad and did not respond.
The next day she calls and says she faked getting robbed and it should serve as a lesson for me and she liked the laptop.

Few months passed She sent me a picture of a new coffee place i really like. I tell her I like the muffins there and we can go on a friday at 5pm. So i can buy the muffin. The day arrives and at 4:50pm i send a text greeting. no response. 5:20pm I start calling and no answer. By 5:50pm she says she still at work and will leave late. I go to the gym.
She says nothing the whole weekend and sunday she greets me by text asking if we could go on monday to the coffee place. I say i will be busy and maybe another day.
She then says just dont text me to confirm if the plan is on in the final hour. And i just stay quiet. Makes me wonder if she was actually at work.

Actually I was clean for years but now slowly slipping into this habbit again. Almost daily I drink one latte with a lot of milk and just a drip of coffee.
I have noticed, around half an hour after I drink it I start to sweat at the armpits. And the smell is really horrible 🤮 I mean, it's not normal sweat smell, it smells completely different, like cannabis (i dont smoke) and it is really gross.

(20M)","All my life I never had the urge to invite someone out or either confess. For some reason while in school people were confessing or getting into relationships or looking for what they liked, I just looked from the distance. I may have felt that I liked someone but never told her.

Time have passed and right now I am on my third year of college. I started thinking that thisl is something I need to deal with. Last semester I met a girl, for me, the most precious woman I have ever seen. She is smart, funny and I can't get enough of her smile and laugh (working hard to make her laugh a lot). I met her on the community study areas of my college residence.

One day I was walking into this floor that has a good amount of desks and some closed rooms for studying and there she was. Instantly I fell in love, I really, really wanted to talk to her. I realized she was a medical student (19F) and there was someone who I knew that also studied medicine and coincidentally was seeing class with her. By the will of God this person was also sitting close to her, so I started chatting with the girl I already knew and tried to get the girl I liked into the conversation. Somehow I managed to do it, got her name and started talking to her or tried to when I got to the study area but it was really difficult because this girl was kinda shy and introverted.

For some context, I am somewhat of a extroverted person, I am extremely talkative and all my life I have found it very easy to make friends. Talking to this girl was a titanic endeavor, she quickly ran out of words and following the conversation for me was difficult because I didn't knew what to talk to her about (I was having a hard time focusing, her eyes just made me go into autopilot mode hahaha). Some weeks passed by and all of a sudden this girl gets extremely talkative, like I am a person who never shuts up but this girl just became next level. The thing is that most of this happened when I asked her about her career, how the exams went and also asked about what she was studying on that exact moment. Like sometimes I managed to drive the conversation about the things she liked, how she loved art, her pets and other stuff. The last times I have talked to her, I am always the one who goes and just sits by her side and start talking. 

Today I did it, I went and started talking to her a lot, we really talked from around ~11pm to almost 2am. I went and sat exactly next to her (I was in front of her, other side of the table) we made a lot of eye contact and I think I made her laugh for a while. I am really into this girl but there are some things that feels weird when trying to ask her number or/and ask her to go grab a coffee. I just don't know if she's just being nice or she is interested or what should I do, this is something I have never experienced before. I'm lost, please recommend me what should I do, is she interested or how can I know it? If she is, how can I ask her out?

I am really a noobie in this area so I'm so sorry if the answer seems obvious. I have made a lot of female friends but have never tried something romantic or of that kind with someone I like and have never flirted.

Any help would be appreciated.

In December I replaced the pump after suspecting the original (from 2012) was broken. Turns out it was a blocked solenoid instead, and given the age of the machine I ended up replacing the boiler, all seals etc..

Machine has been working fine for a couple of months and this morning it died again. I suspect the pump - I've been trying to get the grind size right and this morning went for a too fine a grind size (and tamped quite hard), left the machine to run for about 90 seconds and a very, very slow drip of espresso came out, then nothing at all.

Took the portafilter off, reground at a coarser consistency and started again, but no coffee or water came out at all. Nothing coming out of the steam wand so it's not a solenoid issue (and in any case, all that has been recently thoroughly cleaned or replaced and I only use reverse osmosis water in the machine).

The pump still vibrates but is VERY quiet. No  movement from any of the air bubbles in the water in the outlet pipe of the pump, so I suspect the pump is toast.

Also, yes, the water tank is full and the tube doesn't have any blockages.",0,1741594485.0,gaggiaclassic,0,0.5,False
