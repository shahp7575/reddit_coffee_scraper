I was pregnant with my daughter and woke up one morning with blood everywhere. The doctors called it a threatened miscarriage but never told me the source.

I’m visiting from Germany for a quick trip. I was in Chicago for 4-5 days, and now I’ve just landed in Portland for a short 40-hour stay. This is my first time in Portland, Oregon, and on the Pacific coast in general, so I’m excited to explore. I’m staying downtown, and when I arrived, the city felt a bit… stranded? I didn’t see many people around, and I noticed quite a few shops with boarded-up windows. Is that normal for Portland, or could it be related to Election Day and stores being cautious about potential election-related unrest?

Is there anything specific I should check out or experience today because of the election? Or anything I should avoid for security reasons?

I’m really into alternative rock music, good coffee, and local food, and I’m always up for meeting new people. While I love the outdoors, I know I won’t have enough time for much of that, so I’d love any recommendations for things that might give me a taste of the Pacific coast American lifestyle while I’m here!

1gklzc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gklzc9/sobercuriosity_leading_to_a_huge_wakeup_call/,“Sobercuriosity” leading to a huge wake-up call ,"Drinking alcohol is basically as common as drinking coffee in my culture. I started when I was 15ish (about 10 years ago) and only ever took a 3 month total break from it. I have been curious about going sober for “my thirties” and have been reading up on the sober-curious thing lately. It’s made me realize that my relationship with alcohol is not even half as “casual” as I thought it to be.

My reasoning was: “I don’t drink alone, I don’t drink to not be sad and I only drink on weekends and the occasional mid-week get-together, so I’m good.” 

Since exploring my own sober curiosity I realized some things I hadn’t caught as red flags before:

- If I start drinking it will *never* only be a glass or 2
- “I’m not an emotional drinker” isn’t exactly true for me when I’m still drinking to suppress anxiety at parties etc.
- I black out frequently and quickly
- I have a hard time rejecting drinks when offered
- A lot of my plans with friends consist of “grabbing a drink”, during which I would feel uncomfortable reaching for a non-alcoholic option
- “weekends and occasional weeknight” is still 2 nights a week on average and thus still more than 8 drinks a week on average
- I say I can always stop (which I think is true, as I don’t feel like there is a physical dependency) but when I think about stopping with the goal of never starting again I am incredibly scared (which leads me to believe there is an emotional dependency that I didn’t clock before)
- Lots of my jokes/ things people know me for are based on being a party girl/ drinking a lot 

Figuring all of this out has been really scary and difficult. I am thinking about going completely sober (2 weeks in at this point), but on the other hand I feel like I’m just “making a fuss over nothing” because all my friends and most of my family do the same thing as me and see no problem with it. If anyone went through a similar stage and wants to share their experience I’d be very grateful! ",2,1730853272.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False
1gklz20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/1gklz20/the_last_cup_of_tea/,The Last Cup of Tea,"The Last Cup of Tea

The first time he walked into my tea house, butterflies were dancing outside the window. Two Monarchs, their wings catching light like stained glass, performing an aerial ballet through the golden autumn air. The old copper wind chimes my grandmother hung years ago tinkled softly, their green patina matching the tiny moss garden by the entrance.

I was grinding matcha when he entered, the stone mortar warming under my hands. The rhythmic scraping stopped as our eyes met. He looked like drowning felt - beautiful but desperate for air. His navy blue hospital scrubs were wrinkled, and there was a coffee stain on his sleeve that he'd tried to wash out but couldn't quite manage.

""What would you recommend?"" he asked, and I noticed how his fingers drummed against his thigh - an anxious morse code I'd learn to read over time. The dark circles under his eyes reminded me of tea stains at the bottom of cups.

""You need White Peony,"" I said, already reaching for my grandmother's clay pot - the one with the butterfly etched into its side, wings spread in eternal flight. ""It's like morning dew on spider webs. Gentle but strong enough to hold your world together.""

He raised an eyebrow, amused. ""That's... poetic.""

""Tea is poetry you can drink,"" I replied, watching his expression soften as the steam rose between us. ""I'm Maya.""

""Daniel,"" he said, and somehow I knew that name would change everything.

Our love story unfolded like a tea leaf in hot water - slowly, deliberately, releasing its essence in its own time. Every Thursday afternoon, he'd appear, shedding the weight of hospital shifts like a heavy coat at my door. I learned to read his mood by his footsteps on the wooden floors - light and quick on good days, heavy and dragging when he'd lost a patient.

My tea house became his sanctuary. I taught him about gongfu cha, how to listen to the water's song as it heated, how to hold a cup like you're cradling a bird. He taught me about the stars, sneaking me up to the hospital roof where we'd drink jasmine tea from a thermos and trace constellations with our fingers.

""That's Orion's Belt,"" he'd whisper, his breath warm against my ear. ""Three stars to guide lost people home."" His hand would find mine in the dark, and I'd pretend not to notice how it trembled.

The butterflies stayed all winter, defying nature itself. They'd dance outside my shop window every day, their wings now tattered but still beautiful. My grandmother would have said it was a sign. She taught me to read tea leaves, to sense the stories hiding in the dregs at the bottom of cups. But she never taught me how to read the darkness in someone's eyes, or how to heal a heart that's breaking in slow motion.

I started noticing changes. How he switched from oolong to stronger black teas. How his hospital stories became shorter, darker. How he'd stare at the butterflies like they held answers to questions he couldn't voice.

The last time he came in, it was raining. The butterflies were nowhere to be seen. He ordered Dragon Well - his favorite now - but the tea grew cold between his hands. A single leaf floated vertically in his cup - an omen my grandmother would have recognized. When he left, he touched the butterfly etching on the teapot, his fingers lingering like a goodbye.

His text came at 2 AM:

""The tea you made today... it tasted like goodbye. You always knew, didn't you? What we needed before we did. I'm sorry, Maya. The roof door is never locked. Weird for a hospital, right? Don't call anyone. I just... wanted to thank you. For showing me beauty can exist in small things. In tea leaves and butterfly wings and moments of peace between storms. Look up sometimes, okay? I'll be that weird star that doesn't fit in any constellation.""

I found him on the roof, sitting on the edge, a thermos of cold Dragon Well tea beside him. The same spot where we used to watch stars. The same spot where he first kissed me, tasting of jasmine and hope. This time, when I reached for him, he tasted of salt and goodbye.

He's getting help now. Real help. Sometimes he still comes in for tea, but we orbit each other like distant stars, close enough to see but too far to touch. Some bonds, once stretched too thin, become like over-steeped tea - too bitter to salvage.

But every morning, I still make an extra cup of Dragon Well. And every morning, two butterflies dance outside my window, their wings now iridescent in the dawn light. One has a torn wing but flies anyway, supported by its partner in their eternal dance.

Because sometimes love isn't about happy endings. Sometimes it's about being the person who notices - the trembling hands, the cooling tea, the cry for help buried in casual conversation about constellations. Sometimes love is simply being brave enough to keep pouring tea, keep watching for butterflies, keep believing in the power of small moments to save lives.

Even when those moments break your heart.

And sometimes, if you're very lucky, those broken pieces catch the light just right, like butterfly wings in autumn sun, reminding you that beauty can exist even in endings.

P.S. - I still keep his favorite clay pot, the one with the butterfly etching, ready each Thursday. Old habits die hard, like hope, like love, like butterflies that refuse to fly south for winter.",1,1730853251.0,ShortSadStories,1,1.0,False

If you're into a laid-back and alternative aesthetic, we might just hit it off! Here are multiple pictures of me: [https://imgur.com/a/mA06N8G](https://imgur.com/a/mA06N8G)

When I'm not immersed in a game or exploring extreme metal music (mostly Black Metal), I enjoy the company of my friends. Together, we go on camping trips, visit museums, get dinner or treats, watch movies, play board games, and hang out. We've also visited the Renaissance faire a couple of times. I used to play music with friends as a vocalist. Recently, I've been having movie nights with one of my best friends, enjoying new movies and showing him some he's never seen.

I've also been hanging out at my local game store recently. I met a bunch of cool people there, and I enjoy playing TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Pokémon. Recently, I've also gotten into building model kits. Outside of the game store, I'm trying some language learning, こんにちは. I would love to play D&D, but I don't quite have the time or people, unfortunately. One of my best friend's girlfriends has expressed interest, so don't be afraid to be nerdy with us.

Professionally, I am an IT Tech. I just started at a new place, and I've been learning new things and getting along great with all my coworkers. Academically, I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I'm a laid-back individual who doesn't partake in drugs or party scenes (yes, I even abstain from coffee!). I don't drink alcohol either, but I don't mind if you do. My friends have beers while I'm around. Apparently, I have an INTJ personality type. I maintain a positive and lighthearted atmosphere, constantly cracking jokes with my close-knit group of friends.

In terms of my ideal partner, I'm looking for someone around the ages of 18 and 25, preferably of East Asian or Caucasian descent. As someone who's reasonably skinny, I am also looking for someone who is slim, fit, or petite. I'm not the biggest fan of tattoos or piercings either, but that's not always a dealbreaker, so don't let that completely deter you.

My long-term goals involve building a future together and creating a life filled with meaningful experiences and shared adventures. If you resonate with my interests, values, and long-term goals, shoot me a message and a pic—I’m genuinely looking forward to getting to know you!",1,1730852752.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

This grown woman is choosing money and her fans to enable her. 🙄

Alcoholism is a very hard disease to get over; she cannot cure it by reading books like she “cured” her BPD. She needs to go to a therapist specializing in addiction and AA. 

“Relapsing” is a very traumatic thing for people; I don’t understand why she would be putting this in her vlogs, nonetheless clickbaiting it. She did it on Vlogtober Day 6 last year, too, and at least this time, she didn’t edge the audience to tell the story by doing mourning routines and making shit coffee. 

Then again, see the click-based MLIO vlogs and make dramatic thumbnails. She gets the most views on embarrassing life decisions, bringing in Adsense. She is looking for validation from her fans or trying to show her struggles to help those in need in similar situations, but she doesn’t care about her fans. She neither listens to them nor the snark when she is deliberately making poor choices for her mental health and life. 

By the way, correct me if I am wrong, but I think she has even clicked self-harm and does not want to live anymore in the title or thumbnail. I know she had for sure in the vlogs before. 

This is just such an odd way to process emotions; maybe it would be better if she did like a vlog of the process of sobriety on the side than posting it in a milestone. But during the hardships, it is just such a choice. I can already see her blaming the hate for the reason she relapses. She knows she will not get sympathy from anyone but her enablers and casual watchers, who don’t know the cycle of how she does things. 

I don’t know this just rubs me the wrong way, she introduced this sobriety journey as if it’s the first time, but she has done this multiple times in the past. MLIO 1-3, Limbs Era, Single Era. We know she knows how to keep some things secret, like her continuous lies and the story of what made Limbz break up with her. 

If she or the Cindynablers calls out the snark for their lack of empathy, first of all take a deeper look and Cindy because she has no empathy for anyone but herself. Second, if she doesn’t want people picking her apart then don’t put it on YouTube…

P.S. just out of sheer curiousity do we have any new snarkers, say joining and being disillusioned by Cindy from anywhere as close as 6 months ago? If so then what was the final straw for you?",7,1730852597.0,Lifepluscindy_snark,0,1.0,False

1gklpr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/40something/comments/1gklpr6/the_good_times_misspent_youth/,The “Good Times” & Misspent Youth,"    Today was a very long day.  It was a tiring day. It was the kind of day that makes me miss being 20 again, when I had no responsibilities and not a care in the world, and I was only responsible and accountable for myself. I was broke. I lived in a tiny apartment. I didn’t even own a car. I worked a simple coffee-house job and made minimum wage and lived off of my tips. 
    I looked forward to Tuesdays and Thursdays for ladies night and karaoke. I didn’t have a cell phone or a credit card. I didn’t know what the heck a 401k was for, nor did I care. I barely had an email and I realized it was the most free I have ever been, and today is one of those kinds of days where I just wish that I could have appreciated it more. 
      I would’ve been kinder to myself. I would have nurtured myself more. I wouldn’t have gotten mad over so many stupid things. Or wasted energy on the trivial and mundane. I would have been more present and enjoyed it.
      Don’t get me wrong. I appreciate my life and what I have now, but adulting is hard work. It’s every damn day and there is no rest for the weary or the wicked and sometimes, just sometimes I miss the Carefree days of my misspent youth.

I heard the commuting is terrible in Hanoi so it's probably better to live near where you work. But it's important to me to live in a place that won't make me depressed. I can't find much about this neighbourhood online at all. What would it be like for an expat to live there?

1gkljky,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gkljky/my_husband_is_rotten/,My husband is rotten,"All of this started about 5 months after I married my husband.

We were together for four years before we got married. Everything was great. There were minimal fights, and tons of respect and great communication from the beginning. I loved my husband. He was a kind soul who always tended to me when I was sick, surprised me with cute dates, made me laugh, and loved my friends and family. The moment I introduced him to them, he was greeted with open arms, and he has been there for them all ever since. He's driven my siblings to their sports games, taken my mom out for coffee, and even went hunting with my dad. He always had this way of lighting up the room when he walked into it, and making even the darkest days seem like nothing. He was my person, he was everything.

Just before we got married, he bought me this adorable shepherd cross which we named Potato, Po for short. Po went everywhere with us. Camping, vacations, beach days. He was our only child, and he was very attached to my husband, Reece. Po was approximately a year old, and because he was a rescue we never really new what his previous life before us was like. But, we loved him all the same. 

We enjoyed going to the gym together, going on walks, and cooking together. Some may say it was like the love you see in movies. Picture perfect. And it was, truly. 

Our wedding was beautiful, like nothing I could've imagined. We spent time with our best friends and family, shared memories and I took his last name. It was the perfect day, with my soulmate. 

Reece was a business man and worked for a large company a few cities over, and I was a small business owner. Both of us were fortunate enough that we got to spend most of our time at home with each other a Po, and he has a lovely office upstairs where he could tend to any work related stuff. I preferred to work from the kitchen table, as I felt too confined in an office. Everything was great for the first five months of our marriage. But things slowly started to change. 

Weird things started to happen around March. I started to notice Reece seemed distant, not himself. He often complained of brain fog, like he ""just couldn't think straight."" Then that brain fog turned into migraines. He would become ill frequently, and had a hard time keeping up with his work. Eventually, he was getting ill so often that his job laid him off. He couldn't keep up with the work load, and the company couldn't afford to employ someone who wasn't working enough hours. This took a huge toll on his health. He began sleeping a lot, even during the day. One nap a day turned into two. He wouldn't eat much. I knew he was slipping into  a horrible place. So one day I finally convinced him to see a doctor. 

The doctor said he couldn't explain the migraines, that it was most likely something to do with a past injury or his diet. He was prescribed some antidepressants, and told to start eating more sustaining meals. While I didn't completely agree with the doctor because we always ate healthy and exercised frequently and Reece had no memory of a neck or back injury, I didn't know what else to do, so I just hoped the medication would help. 

One night I was laying in bed watching my show which I usually did before we went to sleep. Reece had posted himself in his office claiming he was in search of another job. I was hopeful for him and I had began to see a small change in his attitude. While he still suffered from the migraines and brain fog, it seemed that his overall mood had improved. He was eating more and coming back to the gym with me when he could. I heard him close the office door and start down the hall to our bedroom. I paused my show hoping to chat with him about his day and his findings. He opened the door and I could see the exhaustion written all over his solemn face. I asked him how he was, and about his findings to which he only replied ""fine."" then slammed our bathroom door. The sound of the shower turning on followed suite. I was utterly shocked. Even in his lowest times he had never slammed the door in my face, or been short with me like that. He always communicated his feelings. I shook off the miserable feeling and started watching my show again. When he emerged from the shower an hour later, his demeanor was the same. I decided not to push and turned my light off to go to sleep.

A few days later and I still hadn't heard an apology for his actions, so I decided to talk to him. I found him in his office, but when I tried the knob I found it locked. So I knocked twice. The door opened a tad, just enough that I could see his bloodshot eye through the crack. ""What's up?"" he asked.

""I would like to speak to you about the other night please."" My voice was stern but low. Instead of opening up the door to let me in, he quickly squeezed himself out, shutting the door behind him again. He crossed his arms, face painted with annoyance. ""You have been very irritable these last couple days, and I feel that it is being turned on me without reason."" He huffed out a small laugh. 

""You really think I need this shit right now, Anne? I lost my job, I can't find anything, and my fucking head is pounding. I can't think straight and I can hardly eat without throwing up. Just leave me alone!"" With that he stormed back into his dark office and slammed the door in my face. I couldn't help but notice the smell that wafted off of him and out of that room. It smelled like rot. 

Days and days passed, and I hardly saw Reece. He kept himself locked up in that office all day and night. He never even came to bed anymore. Part of me wanted to go in there and haul his sorry ass out, but another part of me was terrified. Terrified of the smell that rolled off him that day, of the crazy look in his eyes, of the way his teeth seemed like they were decaying, his gums bloody and red. 

He left one day, I didn't know why, and I didn't really care, all I knew was I needed to get into that office. I had to see why he was keeping himself cooped up in there, as well as what was causing the awful smell. So I started up the stairs on shaky legs, my heart pounded in my chest. The door of course was locked, but I didn't care. I threw my shoulder into it a few times before the frame finally cracked and the door swung open. I silently thanked the gym. But my thoughts were soon a distant memory at the scene that lay before me. Piles of vomit seeped into the carpet next to his desk, chunks of hair laid all over the desk, and a pile of decaying, maggot filled teeth lay in the trash can. His office chair had flaps of torn skin fused in with it, blood speckled the carpet in a few places. I covered my mouth to stop the stench from invading, but it was too late. I booked it to the bathroom and emptied the contents of my stomach into the toilet. I literally had no clue what was going on. I was panicking, I was crying. I dialed his brother and hurried him over to our house.

After I explained everything to him, I took him upstairs to see the office, he had to step out a few times to keep himself from adding to the vomit already on the floor from Reece. I'm sure the horror and disgust in our faces was almost comical. I asked him what I should do, he was speechless. We decided we were going to get him to the doctor. Something wasn't right with him. So when his car pulled in the driveway, we readied ourselves to face him, but he came inside, closed the door, walked upstairs, and locked himself back in the office. Like we didn't even exist. He loved his brother, they were like best friends, so him ignoring both of us like that was insane. 

""Listen, Anne. I think you need to give him some time, call a therapist and see if anyone can do a home visit, describe the situation and see what they suggest. I don't think cornering him is a good idea, and I am most definitely not going back in that room again."" I nodded my understanding, not really able to form words. Obviously his brother, Chris, hadn't caught a glimpse like I did, hadn't seen the strips of meat hanging from Reece's face, or the maggot that writhed on the floor where it fell from him, looking for it's next meal. 

A week had passed, and I hadn't seen Reece at all, but the smell coming from his office was beyond grotesque. I had to keep the windows open at all times, otherwise I would be clutching my stomach over the toilet. I had talked to a therapist as Chris suggested, and they basically told me that I was crazy and needed help. They even suggested hallucinations. It was on the eighth night that the gurgling sound started coming from his office. And they didn't stop. They would get loud and then quiet, like he was choking on his own bodily fluids. I made the mistake and peered under the door one night. My heart almost gave in as I saw his raw, boney feet stumbling around on the carpet. Long, decaying strands of meat trailed behind him, like his skin had been flayed from the bone. Maggots dropped every so often. His voice garbled and raw. In the far corner I could make out one of his eyeballs laying on the floor, flies swarming it. 

It's been five days since I saw that scene under the door. The garbling from down the hall has been going on for days now, his voice less and less distinguishable. It sounds like someone drowning in mud. The thick sludge coating their throat before slowly snuffing them out. Po is scratching at the office door, his whines cutting through the strangled sounds. I am shaking as I type this out, my head feels like I have been hit by a truck, and I swear I can feel something crawling around behind my eyes. ",2,1730851995.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

First things first: congrats on your pregnancy! Whether this was a planned journey or a surprise, discovering you’re expecting is a huge milestone. You might be feeling a mix of emotions right now – joy, excitement, maybe a bit of nervousness. All of these are completely normal. To help you navigate this early stage, here’s a rundown of essential next steps to get you prepared for the months ahead.

# 1. Take a Deep Breath and Let it Sink In

Finding out you’re pregnant is a life-changing moment. Take a little time to let it all settle in. Sharing the news with a close friend or partner can help you process it all. It’s perfectly okay to feel a bit overwhelmed. You’re at the start of an amazing journey, and there’s plenty of time to figure things out.

# 2. Calculate Your Estimated Due Date

One of the first things you might want to know is your due date. You can get a rough idea by adding 280 days (or 40 weeks) to the first day of your last menstrual period. Alternatively, there are many online calculators that can do this for you. This date will likely be adjusted at your first ultrasound, but it gives you a general timeline to start planning.

# 3. Book Your First Prenatal Appointment

Reach out to your healthcare provider to schedule your first prenatal visit. This is typically set for around 8-10 weeks into your pregnancy, though it may be sooner if you have certain health conditions. During this initial appointment, your provider will confirm the pregnancy, review your medical history, and discuss any lifestyle adjustments. They’ll answer your questions, so feel free to bring a list along!

# 4. Start Taking Prenatal Vitamins

If you aren’t already on a prenatal vitamin, now’s the time to start. Look for a prenatal with at least 400–800 micrograms of folic acid, which supports early brain and spinal cord development. Other important nutrients include iron, calcium, and vitamin D. Many options are available over-the-counter, but your provider can recommend a specific one if needed.

# 5. Evaluate Your Diet and Hydration

You don’t need to make drastic changes, but a few dietary adjustments can benefit both you and your baby. Aim for balanced meals with fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Staying hydrated is also key, especially to manage early pregnancy symptoms like fatigue and headaches. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* **Foods to Avoid**: Raw or undercooked meats, high-mercury fish (like swordfish or king mackerel), unpasteurized dairy, and deli meats (unless heated until steaming).
* **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking water regularly supports circulation and helps manage early pregnancy symptoms.

# 6. Limit Your Caffeine Intake

If you love your morning coffee, don’t worry – you don’t have to quit completely. Most experts suggest limiting caffeine to about 200 milligrams a day (roughly one 12-ounce cup of coffee). Caffeine can cross the placenta, so sticking to this guideline is considered safe. If you’re sensitive to caffeine, consider decaf options or swap out with herbal teas.

# 7. Avoid Alcohol and Quit Smoking

Now’s the time to avoid alcohol and, if you’re a smoker, make a plan to quit. Both can affect your baby’s development, and quitting can significantly improve your health as well. Many resources are available, from support groups to counseling services, to help you quit if you need assistance. Your healthcare provider can also guide you on options to make these transitions easier.

# 8. Review Health Insurance and Maternity Benefits

This is a good time to check what your health insurance covers regarding prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum support. You’ll want to know:

* Are prenatal visits and ultrasounds covered?
* Are preferred hospitals or birthing centers in-network?
* What are the expected costs for labor and delivery?
* Does your plan include postpartum support, like lactation consulting?

Understanding your benefits early can save you surprises later on.

# 9. Consider Prenatal Screenings and Genetic Testing

During your first few visits, your provider may discuss optional screenings and genetic testing. These tests can help detect potential health issues for both you and the baby. Some common early screenings include blood tests and ultrasounds, typically around 11-14 weeks. Genetic screening is also available if you choose to pursue it.

# 10. Rest When You Need To

Early pregnancy can bring fatigue, nausea, and emotional ups and downs. Don’t feel guilty about needing extra rest – your body is working hard! Naps, early bedtimes, and even small breaks during the day can make a huge difference. Listen to your body’s cues and take things easy when you can.

# 11. Connect with a Support System

Whether it’s family, friends, or an online community, connecting with others can be incredibly helpful. Talking with those who have been through pregnancy can provide reassurance and helpful tips. If you’re comfortable, sharing the news with a close circle can offer you an early support system as you navigate the ups and downs of the first trimester.

# 12. Learn About Safe Exercises

Staying active during pregnancy is great for your body and can help with energy levels and mood. Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or prenatal yoga are generally safe and beneficial. Always consult with your provider before starting a new exercise routine, and remember to listen to your body – gentle movement goes a long way.

# 13. Prepare for Emotional Changes

Pregnancy brings a whirlwind of emotions, from excitement to anxiety. These feelings are normal, and you’re not alone. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, talking with your partner, a friend, or even a counselor can help. Relaxation techniques, journaling, or even practicing gratitude are great ways to balance the emotional shifts that may come.

# 14. Plan When to Share the News

Deciding when to announce your pregnancy is a personal choice. Some people share right away, while others wait until after the first trimester. There’s no “right” time – go with what feels comfortable for you. If you’re considering when to tell your employer, many wait until they’re a bit further along, but you’ll know best when the time feels right.

# 15. Anticipate First Trimester Symptoms

The first trimester often comes with symptoms like nausea (hello, morning sickness), sore breasts, fatigue, and mood swings. Knowing what’s common can help you feel more prepared. If nausea is challenging, try small, frequent meals and keep snacks like crackers handy. Ginger tea or candies can also help ease queasiness.

# 16. Begin a Simple Journal or Use an App

Keeping track of your symptoms, thoughts, and questions can help you feel more connected to the process. There are many pregnancy apps that offer weekly updates, checklists, and tips. If you’re a pen-and-paper person, a simple journal can work wonders, and it’s a great way to capture memories from this time.

# 17. Look into Finances and Budgeting

Now’s a good time to start thinking about your budget. Babies come with expenses – from baby gear to potential changes in income during maternity leave. Reviewing your budget early can help you feel more financially prepared as the due date approaches.

# 18. Plan for a Safe Work Environment

Consider if any work adjustments are needed to keep you and your baby safe. This might include limiting heavy lifting, avoiding prolonged standing, and being mindful of workplace chemicals. You don’t need to inform your employer immediately, but it’s helpful to think about accommodations that might be necessary as your pregnancy progresses.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding out you’re pregnant marks the start of an incredible journey, and taking these initial steps can help you feel more in control and prepared. Trust your instincts, take things one day at a time, and lean on your support system. Pregnancy is unique for everyone, and there’s no one-size-fits-all approach.

Focus on the essentials and be kind to yourself.

so i started with the company back in 2015. i had quit my job without something lined up because of a toxic work environment. i was unemployed for about a month and decided to apply for starbucks because i knew i had a good chance of getting the job due to 5 yrs of previous coffee experience. it was supposed to be a temporary thing but we all know how that goes.

i’ve made small attempts here and there throughout the years to quit, but nothing really worked out and then in 2021 my area got a massive pay increase that made it even harder for me to find something better.

i recently moved to another state and because of the market change i had to take a $4 pay cut but i was ok with that because my partner got a pretty decent paying job in our new city.

i was incredibly unhappy at my last store to the point where i would have mental breakdowns in the back room several times a month (i used to be a ssv, stepped down a year ago to take care of my mental health.) 

when we decided to move out of state, i figured i’d stay with starbucks and just transfer since it would be easier than looking for a new job. i also hoped that a change of store and scenery would make me love my job again, but i’m halfway through my second day at my new store and i already feel the frustration i was feeling before all over again.

i thought it would be better, but it’s (mostly) the same bs that made me angry at my old store and i feel it’s just a company wide problem. constantly understaffed and poorly managed stores. coming in as a brand new transfer who is also a barista, i don’t want to step on any toes, but i’ve immediately noticed  several gaps at the store but i don’t think it’s my place to say anything, especially since no one really knows me and most don’t know that i was a supervisor for 8 years.

so, here is my question for anyone who has found themselves in a similar situation: should i just quit and find a new, higher paying job or should i stick it out another 9 months until i hit my 10 years and can use my coffee break? is it worth it?

tldr; i’m a 9 year partner, was a ssv for 8 yrs, stepped down to take care of my mental health, moved states, transferred with starbucks but i still feel the burnout even at a new, slower store where the customers are MUCH nicer than my old one. should i stick it out and hit my 10 year coffee break or should i just throw in the towel?",1,1730851767.0,starbucks,1,0.99,False

After maternity leave kasi, need ko pa mag render. At balak ko kumuha ng kasama sa bahay para sa maiiwan kong mga anak.
Graveyard yung sched ko (earning 18,500 package, same kami ng sweldo ng asawa ko) at maiiwan na bata ay isang 6 years old, 3 years old at 3 months old na baby.
Duties and responsibilities ay mainly focus sa 3 years old at 3 months old. (Pakain, paligo, timpla gatas, hugas bote, sterilized ng mga bote, ligpit toys, hugas plato)
As for the 6 years old, alalay nalang like handaan ng food, at ihatid/sundo sa school na 5-8 mins walk pero trisikel nalang para 2-3 mins lang.
Di na magluluto, maglilinis o maglalaba kasi kami naman ng asawa ko gagawa nun.
Sa batas kasi dito sa pinas 6,500 daw ang minimum na sahod + 8 uninterupted sleep + gov benefits. Kaso parang mababa naman yun kasi 3 bata ang titingnan.
May long term kasama kami sa bahay and fortunately makakapag abroad na siya since yun yung pangarap niya talaga. Kaya naghahanap kami ng kapalitan sana.
Nag start sya samin ng 4k at tinaasan namin into 6,500 considered na mag 1 year na siya samin.
May freedom mag cp or videocall sa fam as long as di napapabayaan yung bata.
Free snacks, coffee, foods, foodtrip.
Free vitamins and medicines (plus check up if magkasakit)
Free accommodation, toiletries, wifi + gov benefit.
Bali if ever may makukuha na kasama sa bahay, ganyan pa din yung treatment but much higher salary.

Tried to search sa FB groups kasi at kapag nakakakita ako ng same job posting katulad sa situation ko, usually 7-10k ang sahod. At madaming mga kasambahay ang umaalma kasi 15k na daw ang minimum ng kb/yaya.
Kaya naguguluhan ako. Kung 15k kasi ang ipapasahod, 3,500 nalang matitira sakin 😅 we have bills to pay din kasi lalo na at 2 bata ang nag ga gatas at diaper.

Ps. Need ko daw kasi mag render para rehireable pa din ako if gusto ko bumalik, plus para makuha daw yung final pay ko at yung matben 2 ko.
Wala naman ako problem sa company na pinagtatrabahuhan ko kasi mabait silang lahat at gusto ko yung working environment doon. Toxic lang yung account considering na telco siya.
Need advice please.
Also kung may kakilala kayong gustong mag apply pm lang din po ako. Kahit anong edad po as long as kaya pa. Also babae po ang hanap namin sana.
Marunong po kaming mag asawa makisama at never po kaming nananakit o naninigaw ng kasama sa bahay. Wag lang po sasaktan yung mga bata at habaan lang po yung pasensya sa mga bata.

1gkldff,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gkldff/mf_the_lame_bird_550_words/,[MF] The Lame Bird (550 words)," One day, she was feeling particularly pompous in her grace, charm, and intelligence, after being praised all day by her peers. When she saw a meek bird dwelling in the damp corner of the corridor, surrounded by a herd of incompetents who were struggling to capture the creature, she decided to consolidate her superiority by bravely approaching the pigeon-sized bird in complete confidence.  The black bird, greasy and injured, cowered away from her and stared at her with its large, endearing, brown eyes as she grabbed it and took it to the balcony to place on the grass. The bird stumbled out her hand, wobbled slightly, and took flight, albeit with great effort and a few loose feathers.

A few days passed and she found that whenever she walked home from her dreary routine, she was accompanied by the curious bird. Sometimes it would fly above, sometimes perched nearby, always maintaining a respectful distance. It was always watching somewhere, deeply curious of the woman. Deeply critical of some of her choices, especially those in men. Deeply interested in her popularity, and her apparent loneliness. Deeply concerned for her safety precautions, or the lack thereof. She took note of the bird and distinguished it from others of its kind by the gentle, brown eyes, and the limp in its right leg.

At night, when the overworked companion took to her balcony to soak in the landscape, the bird would rest near her arm and pick at the seeds placed there. And then she would kiss the bird and hold it, and then release it when it flapped its wings violently in her face.

When Winter was getting ready to bid farewell, a new, special unit joined her workplace to help with the case. The foreign unit kept to themselves, hovering near the coffee machines in packs of twos and threes, always in black clothes. They barely spoke to each other, only mutters and grimaces. One such man would work tirelessly in the upstairs office, only speaking if necessary, and otherwise he would be gazing ahead, as if watching the world go by. He claimed the picnic bench his own. The one that was two from the left of hers, in the open space of the courtyard. He would hunch over his lunch, almost too tall and large for the picnic table. After 20-or-so minutes, he would get up and limp over the bin near her bench and dispose of his wrappings, not without catching a glimpse of the beautiful woman multitasking between food and work. This would be the highlight of his day, everyday, until the case was completed and the special unit returned to their headquarters. When Summer approached, she felt like she could finally breath again after the horrendous workload of winter, and she remembered her bird companion. But it seemed like with the finishing of the case, came the end of her chapter with the bird. How she longed to be looked at by its gorgeous eyes, gazing at her with adoration, as if she was its saviour.

She didn’t know, that when she shut her balcony door and readied for bed, a pigeon-sized silhouette sat on a nearby tree, observing the landscape, as if watching the world go by, checking for any threats that might harm his dear beloved.",1,1730851487.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

We were in the same city when we met and basically spent every second with each other I had never been happier than waking up next to him everyday.

1gkkybw,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1gkkybw/what_are_lesbians_on_dating_apps_actually_looking/,What are lesbians on dating apps actually looking for? ,"This is partly a rant but can someone actually explain to me as well why or how it's like this?

So from 16 - 22 I was only looking for a serious relationship and could never find one. I would go out on dates with loads of girls but none of the ones I liked, liked me back. Then from 22 - 24 I was looking only for hookups and causal sex and I also couldn't find anything. That's when I also encountered lots of girls who wanted only serious relationships or at least coffee dates, instead of ""booty calls"" for example.

But I don't understand, for years it seemed like everyone only wanted causal sex, and I really thought that that was what the majority was doing. Because everyone kept talking about ""hookup culture"". And then when I finally came around to it, all of a sudden it seemed like everyone was demonizing it, no one was doing it anymore and everyone just wanted relationships and coffee dates as I did before.

But the thing is, thats what I did for 6 years and all I encountered was dead ends. And I put a lot of effort into it as well. Imagine getting to know hundreds of a girls and getting closer with them, with the goal of a relationship, but every time just having to go back to square one and try again. It honestly just gets to a point where you don't feel like it anymore. Like, can we just skip to the good part?

Honestly, I can tell if I want to have sex with a girl just by looking at her photo. I'm not saying that if we did arrange a hookup, that the sex would definitely happen, but I'm pretty sure that we could at least try to do something sexual and have some fun. I mean whats  the worst that could happen? We're lesbians and I'm pretty sure that neither I nor her would be forcing anything that the other person didn't want. 

So then comes my question, why is there so many lesbians that don't know what they want and just want to ""see where things go""
 What do you mean see where things go? How is anything supposed to go anywhere, if you have no idea where or how you're going?  Also, it seems like the only women who might actually know what they want are 35+, which is really a bummer honestly. Because I'm 24 and I'm having a hard time finding someone in my age range, in their twenties.

And it's not even that I ever stopped wanting a relationship, it's just that through so many failed dating experiences I came to realize I'm not really missing out on as much as I thought I was. I'd still be psyched to find an actual good and healthy relationship, it's just that I can't believe how hard it is to actually find one considering how normal my criteria is. The only thing that I ask of her is that she is financially stable and okay with the fact that in some periods, our relationship might have to be long distance because of my job.

And I know that still isn't a small thing to ask for, but still out of the thousands of woman Ive talked to and matched with,that literally none of them could have matched this criteria. Also, of course that she has to live somewhat nearby, because if not, than we literally wouldn't be together for like 90% of the time, which just doesn't make sense.

Also, she would have to like sports as well, because sports is a huge part of my life. I do some art as well. And of course, my age, and my type, which is feminine women. In my opinion, these aren't really that big of criteria,.but considering there's literally no lesbians on the apps near me, I'm pretty much screwed for most of my life.

And what exactly is the point in texting 24/7 about a million silly little things, with no purpose behind it? I don't understand why everyone is trying to pretend that we're meeting spontaneously or organically, when we're literally on dating app. People see they want someone who knows what they want, and then when you tell them, their response is that ""they just want hang out, make friends, to see where it goes"".

Honestly, I call bullshit that so many people are on dating apps actually to meet friends. I don't understand why they're lying. I feel like people have no idea what they actually want and that you can't even trust them. They are just playing these silly little games that start drama and go nowhere.

1gkku7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1gkku7n/ah_thats_what_the_25_was_for/,"Ah, that's what the $25 was for","So I came in at 4 today to the GM and day shift person both wearing masks and a woman standing outside with her suitcase and dog. I came in and was hit with the heavy smell of cleaning products. I asked what was up, and they asked if I smelled the lady. Fortunately my nose is bad at its job so all I smelled was Fabuloso and air freshener.

Apparently the woman couldn't afford a room and was now waiting for a taxi. I was instructed under no circumstances to let her check in.

A little while later a truck pulled up and a family came out. They've been staying with us off and on for a couple weeks. It's three siblings in their 60s-70s who are all dealing with some mental illnesses and also homelessness from what I can understand. A church is helping them, but they are constantly fighting with each other so the situation is complicated.

They were back and forth between the truck and the lobby trying to get their shit figured out with a church lady who kept assuring them that god would help them find the answers. It was not an ideal way to start a shift.

Then the church lady came in and said the lady with the dog had drugs, and the lady with the dog was having a loud argument with one of the siblings outside. I'm not religious, but I did find myself asking god what did I do to deserve all of this? What did I do to deserve all of you? And then I started thinking about Coheed and Cambria which made everything better.

Fortunately the woman with the dog left on her own without me having to run her off and the unwell old folks got checked in. I tried to settle in for a quieter evening.

Later on though a guy came up to the desk looking to check in. There were immediate alarm bells because he smelled like liquor and had an empty beer bottle in his hand. I decided just to try to check him in in the interest of getting him out of the lobby as quickly as possible.

He handed me a debit card first, then asked if the ID had to match it. I said yes, and they both have to be yours. He told me his identity had been stolen on the dark web. Cool, one of those kind of check ins. 

He gave me his ID and it did match his card so that's all good. The card declined of course and he expressed frustration because apparently he has $180k in the bank. Of course, sir.

He waffled for a bit on what he was going to do, then asked if he could use the bathroom. I said sure.

A little while later he came out, asked about the location and hours for Best Buy, then started to leave. Then he paused and came back and dropped $25 over the desk ""For my trouble."" I tried to stop him and give him his money back and assure him that I didn't need it but he kept walking. I left it on the desk to contemplate what to do with it because it doesn't feel great taking money from someone who is clearly not all there.

A little while later I went to restock the coffee station and glanced into the bathroom beside it. The floor was soaking wet, there was toilet paper and seat covers everywhere and his empty beer bottle in the middle of the floor. I then realized what trouble he meant.

I went back to the desk, pocketed the $25 and grabbed my cleaning supplies.",62,1730850027.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,4,1.0,False

I will be staying overnight in downtown Albany on Wed night…care to play??

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women...Especially a woman who lacks the right kind of attention from younger guys. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man…I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves...and husbands don't always make you feel wanted.

I am a fun, discreet, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play…and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secret🤫

I live in western CT but travel regularly all over CT, western MA and upstate NY for my business😉

After she got little bit distant from me. We are still texting every day, from morning to night, but we are not hanging out at all now. I noticed that if I don’t suggest some plans she will not do it by herself.

I don't have code names for the new guys just yet, mine is piranha, the other 2 is hammer head(HH) and tiger shark(TS). For now I'll be calling the new players L and J. 

I moved part 1. Added a couple more parts to the end, moved part2 upfront and had the 2 new guys start in the morning coming back from a local coffee shop and noticed world stat agents. 

L rolled high enough that the world sat guys told him theyre destroying the building the next day, thinking they were one of the workers. So he alerted me since I own the apt. 

I don't panic cause we have ammo and weapons. Even though I'm gm I'm playing on the side lines, frozen irl like im in a daze and dont know what to do. That's when one of the players came up with using furniture in the halls, so we all do that for each floor. I call rex to get me in contact with world sat cause I want to talk it out, and this is where coms get cut. 
 
So me and Hh go on bikes, cause we don't have cars yet, to see rex who basicly tells me world sat don't want to speak. But heard they was planning something tomorrow. Rex's police scanner goes off about a fire and he says, I guess they're starting today. As we look through a window and see smoke in the air. 

We rush back. But irl L, J, and TS left to get snacks from the kitchen as we were going to rex, so in game, they went back to the 3rd floor where we live to eat. At the same time world sat was setting off fires on the first floor, unbeknownst to the rest of the party. So when they came back to play irl I tell em world sat started fires and to help evacuate the apt. 

As we are evacuating people, I have the players roll 1d10. they need to get 10  per evacuation, not all at once but some did hit 10 exact a couple times which sped things up. Each had 5 to evac. After that, one player was like can I check to see if one of the fire fighters has a gun, I don't trust them.

And thats what kicks off a kind of shootout. Cause he does in did spot a gun on one of them and whispers to us about it and we had the numbers so we shot em outside the front doors like fish in a barrel. I let the Andersons have a blunderbuss. And other tenants that stayed had some pistols, like wise, everyone playing had a pistol.

This is when TS and L decide to check the fire truck out and find the smoke is being produced by several emitters. At this point they set off to disarm them, some of the npcs take the dead over to the empty lot across the street where the first truck is. The rest of us regroup on the 3rd floor where I get a call from an unknown number. Folks at world sat want to negotiate. 

This is where we had to stop playing irl but ill post pt2, tomorrow.

***Monday***

“Get me everything you can on “Peta Cobrati,” Echo One said, leaning over Max’s shoulder. “We need to know who she is and what her angle is.”

“Already on it,” Max said, typing in a blur.

“And look up the Lion retrieval and cross-reference it with LA. See what it is, if it even really exists or if that was her way of letting Two-Three know his cover is blown.”

“It’s real,” One-One said, coming in from the left apartment with a pair of burger bags and two cardboard trays of drinks he’d procured from the nearest Burger King. “Two pounds of solid emerald that was on tour with us courtesy of the Zambians a while back. Rumour has it, it went missing but turned up again so quickly no one’s willing to officially verify it.” He stopped just inside the war room and put the two bags down on the conveniently placed coffee table that was there for all things not business-related. “I bought a variety of things in case you were all hungry, including an extra-large protein shake for you, Max. Hope you like strawberry.”

“Forget about the freaking food! How do you know about the Lion?” Echo One demanded.

One-One shrugged. “An ex of mine worked at the capital when the shit hit the fan over it. According to her, it was stolen while in secret transit through this city.”

“How did the media not climb all over that? Surely we’d have heard about a theft of something that big!”

One-One shrugged again. “I don’t know what to say, boss-man. I’m just telling you what I heard.” He pulled out a wrapped burger the size of both his hands and a cup of fries from one bag and snatched up a drink, chortling happily to himself. “Come to Papa,” he drooled, returning to the other apartment.

“He’s right,” Max said, bringing up a page of the emerald that was literally the size of an ostrich egg. She’d also uncovered a buried report about the theft that went nowhere since it was relocated quickly enough.

Echo One looked over the screen and swore. “Why would you give Two-Three credit for that thing’s retrieval?!”

Max shook her head. “I didn’t. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you. Someone gift-tagged us this cover story. I was still in the process of making ours up when the new one shot us into the top Google search spot *in freaking LA.”*

“FUCK!” He stared at the chest-cam footage of Three-Two. From where he stood, he had a clear view of the woman in question, and Echo One knew that wasn’t an accident. ‘Friends close … unknown enemies closer’ type of thing. “What do you know about Cobrati?”

Max typed furiously for far longer than expected. Echo One was just about to ask her what the problem was when a different screen appeared on Max’s monitors with a clear picture of Peta Cobrati, including relevant spot facts. “Huh,” Max huffed, squinting at the screen. “Did not pick her for thirty-eight.”

“MAX!”

“Oh, right. Ummm… Ahhh! That explains the legal knowledge. She’s a freelance police consultant with the authority to slot into any investigation across the country.”

Max frowned. “Is that a thing?” *Isn’t that the FBI’s job?*

“Damn, someone up the food chain must like her to get that kind of nationwide clearance.”

“So, she’s a cop?”

Max winced. “Kinda? I mean, she has the roving rank of detective, probably to get around red tape, but every other cop I know is locked into one jurisdiction. They don’t even cross a city, let alone state lines. And speaking of her old jurisdictions, hers was right here in LA. Looks like she … oh, holy crap! I officially love this woman!” Max gushed, her expression taking on something akin to hero worship as her eyes absorbed whatever was on her screen. “Fuck me, that’s badass!” Her shuddering huff was one of disbelief.

Echo One was ready to throttle her. “Max,” he warned, his voice taking on an icy edge.

Ignoring his warning tone, she turned to him excitedly. “She was a decorated detective who left the city some fifteen years ago after a dirtbag with deep pockets tried to bribe her into looking the other way during a homicide investigation. Boss, she made him *eat* his expensive jewellery at gunpoint! Even his chunky gold chain necklaces and his Rolex! It nearly choked him.”

She made the double hand gesture for the ‘mind officially blown’ before catching his murderous glare and settling back to work. “Ummm, yeah, so … ahhh … she worked a couple of months for the state police before going into her current gig and has been there ever since.” She must have opened up her search parameters using facial recognition, for suddenly, pictures appeared on her screen where Cobrati rubbed shoulders with the country’s elite … and not just the socialites. Business tycoons and politicians. People with real pull.

Echo One thought about her attack on the guy. “How is she not in prison for assault?”

Max shrugged. “I guess the guy dropped the charges, or one of those bigwigs there helped her out. Or maybe she made a deal and left quietly. I don’t know. All it says here is that she relocated soon afterwards to New Jersey…”

“What’s she doing back here?”

At that, Max’s expression clouded. “I don’t know that either. Technically, she has her PI licence, and her clearance rate is really high. But her primary job is being a national player for the police. I can’t even begin to calculate the odds of her being on assignment right here when this all happened.”

Echo One loathed unanswered questions. “She can’t be here because of Phillipa. Helen didn’t even know she was coming before last night. Is there any way to find out whether she’s here in a police capacity or a PI one?”

“You want me to hack LAPD database?”

God, it was tempting. There was no doubt Max could get in and out without anyone being any the wiser, but things about Peta Cobrati had the hairs on the back of his neck standing up, and he hadn’t made it this far by ignoring his instincts. She was trouble, with a capital T.

More pictures popped up—this time with members of the Nascerdios family. One in particular caught Echo One’s eye and almost caused him to smile, probably because he could relate. Going by the decorations in the background, it was clearly a Christmas party. Clefton the musician and Rory the racer were pressed to either side of Cobrati with their lips firmly attached to her cheeks in exaggerated kisses while a piece of mistletoe could just be made out at the top of the photo. Strahan the magician stood in the background with an amused smile, while Cobrati’s pained expression and tense shoulders implied she’d *literally* rather be doing anything else.

The number of men and women in the world who wouldn’t commit murder to be on the receiving end of a double kiss from those two bachelors could be counted on one hand. Yet Cobrati obviously didn’t feel that way about them. True, some people were simply like that. Money, wealth and privilege meant nothing to them, and when it was pushed onto them, they tended to push back.

That! That’s what was bugging him. She wasn’t pushing back. The woman who was on record for choking a man on his expensive jewellery was enduring something she plainly hadn’t wanted to. Like they were … *family?*

He squinted, trying to find any family resemblance between them. All three had swimmers’ builds, and they were attractive in their own right, but that and their fair skin was as far as the similarities went. The three Nascerdios all had the telltale black hair and eyes, whereas Cobrati had long locks of Irish red hair and green eyes.

He breathed out slowly and shook his head, the puzzle rolling over in his head. The Nascerdios name trumped everything, much like a royal name. Anyone who married or was born into that family automatically had it, whether they liked it or not. A Nascerdios never took another name. It was unheard of.

Perhaps she was dating one of them. That might make her tolerate their nonsense. Keep the peace for the holidays, so to speak.

Two-One re-entered the room. “Boss, I know I can’t be with my team right now, but I was hoping—” Whatever he’d been about to say never passed his lips once he spotted what was on Max’s screens. “What’s going on?” he asked with a cautious frown.

“That’s what we’re trying to work out,” Echo One said, eyeing the older man cautiously. He flicked a finger at the screen. “Cobrati, the woman in the middle, is in the room with Helen and the rest of your team.”

“Shit…that can’t be a coincidence,” Two-One swore, reaching for his phone.

“Who are you calling?”

“Headquarters. This isn’t about the company.”

Echo One snatched the phone from the man’s hand and disconnected the call. “You don’t get to—Start talking!” he demanded, his frustration at the man at an all-time high.

Two-One breathed slowly through his nose. “Okay. Word is, the boss’ daughter is in a relationship with a distant, non-blood-related cousin to the Nascerdios. And now, someone who knows them well enough to take that shot is here poking their nose into this?” he gestured at the picture.

The words that stuck in Echo One’s mind were *distant, non-blood-related cousin to the Nascerdios.* Was that what Cobrati was? It would certainly explain a lot.

It was also a major complication they didn’t need, and better to find out now than later. Echo One turned back to Max. “Reach out to your dad and see if he can shed any light on this.”

Max nodded and stretched her hand towards a cell phone that sat in a cradle to one side of her hub.

I looked back at them and they just kept staring me, I did not understand why, I was dressed pretty normally, just some shorts, an average tshirt and some sneakers, nothing out of the ordinary, but they kept staring at me as if I was doing something wrong or something, I then kept driving away on my bike and enjoyed my day, but this stayed with me until just a while back when I was talking to a coworker of mine, when I told him this he responded that ""Maine is full of racists"".

The plain truth is that I find my coworker to be unnecessarily competitive and kinda undermining. When we first started working together she would jump in mid conversation while I was speaking to the clients and answer the questions they had. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt and say she might have been trying to be helpful, me being new and all, but it got old very quick. Our workload isn't clearly divided either but I do my best to communicate with her what clients I will be working on so we don't double call or run into each other's work, and although she reciprocate most of the time, she still does irritating stuff that makes me question her intentions. For example, it has happened a few times now where I will be working in a client's account and all of a sudden I hear her calling them and doing the work that I was about to do. Our company system tells you if someone is already logged in to the account , which makes me even more suspicious that she might be doing it intentionally. I do want to point out our workload is very light and we find ourselves with lots of space time, but I don't think that's a reason to take over someone else's work. One time, she blamed her coffee intake for the fact that she did all the work and left me with nothing to do by the time I got there. Anyway, I have tried not giving into it but she is so irritating. Because of it I find myself rushing to do my work or mirroring her behavior which makes me so upset because I am not that type of person. It has cause the dynamic to be sort of passive aggressive and I hate it. I know the best thing to do is to focus on myself but when you are working so close with someone else it's hard not to let it affect you. Anyway that's the end of my rant, lmk if you ever experienced a coworker like that before and any tips to de-escalate the situation.

But I found a way out. No cold turkey, no intense withdrawals, just a slow, gentle trick that actually worked. Figured I’d share it here in case it helps anyone else struggling.

Here’s what I did:

1. Keep Your Routine (Just Sneak in Decaf) - For me, making coffee was as much a ritual as it was about the caffeine hit. So I kept the routine exactly the same — grinding my coffee fresh every morning.

2. Tiny Swaps - I started with 18 grams of caffeinated coffee per cup. For the first few days, I took just 1 gram of that 18 and swapped it with decaf. So, I’d brew 17g caffeinated and 1g decaf.

3. Slowly Up the Decaf Ratio - Every week, I’d add another gram of decaf and take away a gram of the regular stuff. Week by week, I eased my way down until I was at a full cup of decaf, about two months in.

Now, it’s not zero caffeine, but it’s low enough that I don’t have those nasty side effects anymore. The best part? I still get my morning coffee ritual, and I’ve adjusted to the taste. It’s like I tricked my brain into accepting “coffee-like” without the actual caffeine dependency.

If quitting caffeine feels impossible, try this. Just a little patience, and you can sidestep the headaches and keep your coffee habit. Hope it helps someone!",6,1730848930.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1gkkejv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gkkejv/i_live_with_the_shitiest_roommates_ever/,I live with the shitiest roommates ever,"So I moved out of my moms house a little while after high school because she wasn't emotionally available enough and I had to be the second parent (I'm the oldest of 4). And me and two of my ""friends"" from high school thought it would be a great idea to get an apartment together. How wrong we were. From the beginning it was pretty awful. I slept in the living room because we got a 2 bed 2 bath and we agreed that I could pay  less in rent because I slept in the living room. Terrible idea, my roommates are always loud when they come out here, whether it's to cook food, or do laundry. They slam doors, pots and pans, and talk like there in different rooms all the time. On top of being loud in the kitchen they take forever to clean their dishes. Now I'll admit I don't clean my dishes right after I use them all the time, but I mostly do. The only exception is I forgot a sheet pan in our oven for 2 days. These guys on the other hand only clean when it's convenient for them, like when they need too reuse a pot or pan, or all the clean dishes are gone because they don't  clean them regularly. And even if they do the dishes are nasty afterwards. That's not even the worst part. There isn't a single surface in the kitchen that's clean. Counters, stove top, microwave, even the fridge shelves are dirty. And I'm always the one that cleans them because I can't stand to look at a dirty kitchen. They leave trash on the counters as well, we have like a half island/bar area that is completely covered in trash, stains, and shit they refuse to put away. And on top of that when they finally decide to take out the trash they don't even do that they just take the trash out of the bin and leave the bag in the apartment. And that's just the kitchen.

The living room faced a lot of the same problems until they got desks and PC's for their rooms. There were constantly dishes and half drank water bottles all over the place. One time the worst of the two, I'll call him ""C"", left a sauce packet in between the couch cushions and it broke and got every where. My grandma gave me a coffee table to put in the living room and before they both moved to their rooms with there games, they left a ton of trash on top of it and, on the shelf below. And the worst thing that they did was fall asleep on the couch when they got high, when they had a perfectly good bed in their room.

That brings me to another thing that makes them shitty roommates. They get high a lot of the time, and when they do they're loud annoying, and sound even dumber than they normally do. They order food and make a mess of it. They watch TikTok's at loud ass volumes, and are rude to the kittens.

About 3/4's of the way through our lease, we got some rescue kittens from C's mom's restaurant. They stay in C's room and have everything they need in there food bowls, water bowl, litter box, toys, etc. But my roommates constantly treat them like shit. They yell at them acting like they understand English, for instance, they love running and walking around your feet, and they've even tripped me up once or twice. But all my roommates do is call them assholes and retards for doing it. And I'm like, they're not old enough to understand how get out of peoples ways, and on top of that they don't speak English so they'll never understand you. And these two kittens are angels, they haven't destroyed anything, they learned how to use the litter box instantly and they don't even fight each other. Anytime they're play fighting my roommates are always like stop fighting, or why you guys always gotta fight. This isn't even the worst part. On multiple occasions C has forgotten to feed or give them water, clean out there litter box, and he hardly even engages with them at all. Most of the time he's yelling at them.

This leads me to another part, C's bedroom, C's bedroom is so dirty. He's only ever vacuumed once the entire time we've been living here. He leaves piles of clean and dirty clothes all over the place. And the worst part he doesn't clean up the litter on the floor. So every time I have to get clothes from my side of the closet (we share a closet because I don't have storage sleeping in the living room) I step in litter. And sometimes there have been cat turds on the ground, because again he doesn't clean the litter box. I'm also pretty sure that there's a half a case of unfinished water bottles in his room alone. That's not including the 10-15 empty ones he's got stashed behind his room door.

And now the worst part, the bathroom I share with C. Surprise surprise, it's dirty. Everything is dirty, the floor, the bathmat, the mirror, the sink, and especially the toilet. He leaves toothpaste stains in the sink, spit stains on the mirror, sometimes above my head, I'm 5'7"" he's 5'9"". He refuses to buy a new towel that won't leave fabric all over the place. He never takes out the trash in the bathroom. And he leaves literal shit in the toilet and sometimes throws his USED toilet paper in the trash. On top of that he somehow manages to get shit on the toilet seat, and cover, that he never cleans up I clean it the most, because I don't trust him to do an even half decent job. And there was one time I found shit on the floor, and I wasn't sure if it was him or our kittens. Which shouldn't even be something I consider but here we are.

And finally, I don't know if they're actually dumb but they act fucking stupid. All they do is sit in their rooms playing video games while watching TikTok's or YouTube videos. C rages at any video game if it doesn't go his way and my other roommate ""D"" rages when ever he plays online games, which he almost exclusively plays. C's raging is worse than D's though. He yells, slams things, and says he's going to murder his enemies and their families. Sometimes he's just talking about enemies in single player games. They both work at the same panda express, and all they do is complain about how shitty their job is while doing next to nothing to change it. On top of that they suck with money. They both spend carelessly and on multiple occasions C has barely been able to pay his rent. And what I've heard from one of his co-workers when I gave him a ride back to his place cause C and D fell asleep after they got high, is that C barely has anything in his savings. He only pays $200 more than me in rent, and has less monthly expenses.

And I can't move out because I'll lose the security deposit, I can't move back with my mom because it's bad for my mental health. I can't get my own place because my job doesn't pay me enough (I'm looking for better jobs or just a second one). And I don't know anyone I could live with, and I don't want to risk living with random people cause I don't want this to happen again.

That's all I can really think of right now, I might post again later. Thank you to anyone that read this, questions and discussions are welcome",6,1730848824.0,Vent,3,0.88,False

1gkk825,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1gkk825/organizing_joint_expensesfinances_cc_perks_and/,"Organizing joint expenses/finances, CC perks, and learning to use credit ""correctly""","**This is long (I'm sorry). :( Gold stars and my deep appreciation for anyone who manages to get through it. <3**

My husband and I have been married 2 years, living together for 7. Combined we make about $140k. We have a house (mortgage), one vehicle (car payment), three pets, and no kids. Our finances are a mess.

I am looking to consolidate our debt, streamline our finances, save more, and accumulate points for travel. Problem is, we've always carried balances on our credit cards... Neither of us learned the ""proper"" way to use cards (paying them off every month).

My husband has:

* MBNA CC: balance of $4780 (19.9%) that he's paying off (they froze it two years ago after he didn't submit some kind of identity document?? Still not clear on that), and
* Credit Union LOC for $10k (10.2%) with a balance of $9800. :|

I currently have:

* CT Triangle CC ($2500 limit with offer for $4500) - balance $1593
* CO Gold CC ($1000 limit) - balance $950
* Tangerine CC ($3000 limit) - balance $2220

Investments:

* Wealthsimple TFSA - $7735 (+4.90% ""all time"")
* Wealthsimple RRSP - $2290 (+9.6% ""all time"")
* Wealthsimple Trade - $481 (I am learning how it works so I haven't put much in here... +11.93% ""all time"")

We both pay into pensions via our employer.

I was recently approved for Disability Tax Credit and got some money back with it, so I plan to use that to pay off the balances.

For day-to-day banking/payroll, I use Tangerine and he uses the credit union he's been with for 23 years (since he was a teenager). We HAD a joint account with the credit union but they dicked us around and now only he has access to the account (I banked with them for a short time but I got tired of their inability to fix the joint account situation and the monthly fees I gave up and fully switched to Tangerine). For the last year or so I've just sent him an eTransfer for my half of the bills. He has been struggling to manage it lately (a few payments have bounced), though, and I don't like being cut off from joint expenses.

He's finally agreed to leave the credit union and have us ""join forces"":

* Both payroll into one account,
* Consolidate our debts and focus on paying off,
* Build our savings (I have a few thousand in an RRSP and in a TFSA, he has $500 in an RRSP and no TFSA),
* Find a way to earn something (cash back, points, loyalty, etc) on our bill payments, and
* Find a credit card to use as our ""regular spending"" (with the intent of building points for eventual travel).

I think I have a decent plan for most everything, but the credit cards are throwing me a loop.

Unless there are major holes in this plan, I think this is our plan right now:

1. Joint chequing account with Tangerine (where I bank currently). Our payroll goes here (we get paid bi-weekly on opposite weeks). Alternate would be to use Wealthsimple Cash (joint account).
2. We each have a personal chequing account with Tangerine to put our personal ""mad money"" into (a small, agreed upon amount that we get whenever we get paid... Money to use for coffee, clothes, treats, etc). Alternate would be to use Wealthsimple Cash.
3. Joint savings accounts set up as ""envelopes"" - savings for vet bills/expenses (we have Trupanion insurance but I'd like to build up some savings as two of our pets have a ""pre-existing"" condition), savings for oil (house is heated with oil and a ductless heat pump), savings for family gifts, etc.
4. We get him a TFSA with Wealthsimple (I have mine there) and move his RRSP over as well. Small auto-transfers set up.
5. As much as I like the idea of using PaySimply/Plastiq to get the points, I am guessing the most straightforward thing to do is to use my CT Triangle card to pay bills (since that's a thing, I guess) and have the card automatically paid off each month via our joint account. We don't use CT family stores that much but I suppose we could...they have decent sales.
6. Get a joint LOC (with a better rate? I have no idea what a ""good rate"" is in the current economy...I still have to research this one), transfer his old/high-interest debt over, and work to pay it down. My current cards (listed above) put on hold/left empty. Need to figure out what activity/spending is needed to avoid deactivation...unless I can keep my oldest card active and close the other two? I'd rather reduce my # of cards but I don't want to bugger up my credit - especially where our mortgage term ends Sept 2025 (that's a different kettle of fish I need to learn about).
7. And the big one that I'm having the most trouble with: learning how to use a credit card for expenses and pay it off each month. I have a bad case of wanderlust and we haven't really been able to travel due to the associated costs and the aforementioned financial mess. I'm thinking an AMEX Cobalt or one of the Aeroplan cards would be our best bet for where we want to travel eventually (we're in eastern Canada and would like to travel to the rest of Canada, the US, Caribbean, the UK, and Europe). Do we buy our groceries, gas, family gifts, etc with this card - ensuring we don't go over the amount of income we have after bills/personal ""mad money"" comes out - and then pay it after the statement date?

I suspect I will receive several comments about YNAB, Google Sheets, and other platforms which is fine - its definitely something I'm investigating - but I know my mind and how overwhelmed I can get. If the budgeting platform doesn't auto-pull transactions or does so but disconnects constantly, I will give up on it. If we can't quickly see what we have available by glancing at an app on our phones, we're not going to use it. I tried and gave up on Mint (and a few others) more than once over the years. I just can't stick with it. ""Change"", you say... It's my end goal. Truly. We WILL get there.

I am intelligent, but I also have a hard time with processing and catching onto things due to my ADHD and mental health. Neither of us had any real education on credit and debt growing up, so - it's been a process (to say the least). 

Feel free to offer a better plan if I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be (a running trend with me :\\ ). I feel really vulnerable sharing all of this - and really stupid - but I know I (we) need guidance.

Huge thanks to anyone that made it through the above. I'm so grateful for this sub and the intelligent people that share their wisdom, guidance, and advice with those of us that struggle with financial literacy.

Long story short is I am still with my WW after two separate episodes of her being unfaithful.

By and large I feel like we are in a good place. Or at least not a bad place. It's not water under the bridge, but I feel like enough time has passed and the emotions aren't so raw, and enough good things have happened that I can start to feel confident that I made the right choice to stay.

However one area in which I feel I am still having to work hard is in how I feel about being attracted to her, and being intimate with her.

In every other aspect of our relationship there is a third thing that pulls our focus. We're doing something for the kids, or we're doing some work on the house, or we're booking a trip or social event with some friends, or we're solving some other practical life issue. It's like even if we're alone together there is always a third thing that makes us not alone.

But attraction and intimacy between us is different. It's just us, together. And when it's like that and we're truly alone together, her infidelity can taint all the feelings that are supposed to be good.

I could give a thousand examples but some morning last week I was sat in bed drinking coffee and my wife came in from the bathroom and she was nude. Just the sort of momentary practical nudity that happens every day in a marriage, and which sometimes goes unnoticed or unappreciated.

But on that day, for whatever reason, my brain was just like ""Hey! We like that!"" and I felt compelled to just look, and to enjoy seeing her nude body. I don't know if she noticed me looking. If she didn't notice that time then I know that there are other times when she will have noticed. And felt good to look, and I felt no shame whatsoever about just looking and enjoying her. 

That lasted right up until the other part of my brain reminded me of what she's done and then  that good feeling was washed away by... I don't even know. Embarrassment? Like I now feel embarrassed to be attracted and turned on by my wife? I almost feel childish or silly for being turned on by her?

The part of our relationship that was just me and her, no third thing, now has this dark cloud over it. Not always, but I can't keep it from showing up, and when it does there's no 'third thing' to shield me from it.",5,1730848149.0,survivinginfidelity,4,1.0,False

Evasive, mixed signals, immature, hid behind a computer screen, aloof, narcissistic, insensitive, contradictory, completely took me for granted. Entirely self-absorbed. Acted like he was a big prize. Meanwhile, he didn't even have a job like he could take me for a cup of coffee, let alone dinner.

I was trying to be kind and patient, but I think even Mother Theresa would've ended up telling this jerk off. He kept telling me his exes were mean to him and not his soft place to land. 

I finally realized it was HIM. Nobody could be a soft place to land. He was so evasive and shady you wouldn't even know where to put the cushion!

Anyway....I kept thinking some of his traits were just Capricorn traits and I needed to be patient, but you all made me realize he was just a jerk.

Anything in *\*asterisks and italics\** isn't meant to be read aloud, it's there to either hint at the tone or provide context that might help the script make more sense.



**Summary:** Listener is stressed and running late to work when they - literally - run into their grumpy neighbor, Narrator. Turns out, Narrator is pretty concerned about Listener and wants to take care of them, in their own unique way.



**Word Count:** Approximately 1,229 words (Not including any actions or cues left in asterisks and italics)



**Writer’s Notes:** It's been a minute but I promise I'm still writing scripts!



**Script Below:**

  
*\*Listener is in a rush as they rush to the door - already, they’re twenty minutes behind and doomed to be late to work. They fling the door open and slam it shut behind them as they run outside. Immediately, they crash into their neighbor, who stumbles back with a surprised yell.\**



*\*Surprised/Annoyed\** “Hey! Where the hell do you think you’re going, bumping into everything like that? You must’ve bruised your shoulder bumping into the door like that, not to mention how you probably bruised yourself from running straight into me like that.”



**(Pause)**



“Whatever, don’t bother with your apologies. You better tie your shoes first instead; can’t have you tripping and stumbling into someone else **again-**”



*\*Narrator pauses.\**



*\*Curious, a bit cautious\** “Wait, don’t… Stand back up.”



**(Pause)**



“Yeah, I know what I said, but that’s not… Look, just forget it, okay? Just- Stand up.”



**(Pause)**



“Hey. Look at me.”



*\*Narrator waits a moment but Listener doesn’t respond or turn towards them. Narrator huffs, trying to maintain their calm, despite their gruff attitude.\**



“Listen. I’m not- I’m not mad at you, okay?”



**(Pause)**



“I know, I know. But I promise I’m not. Not actually *mad.* I’m just kinda, y’know, like this.”



**(Pause)**



*\*Gentler\** “I mean that I have a voice and face that aren’t exactly… Well… I don’t have the most ‘friendly demeanor’ - that’s pretty obvious. But I promise that I’m not angry with you right now. So can you please look at me? Just for a second?”



**(Pause)**



“Thank you. Now stay still for a second.”



*\*There’s a few seconds of silence before Listener gets shy and looks away.\**



*\*A bit gruff\** “Hey, did I say you could look away?”



*\*Narrator sighs.\**



“Sorry. I didn’t mean for it to come out like that. I meant to say that I want you to keep looking at me.”



**(Pause)**



“...Huh. You look tired.”



**(Pause)**



“No, really. And I don’t mean just the ‘couldn’t fall asleep last night’ tired. You look exhausted, like you haven’t been able to sleep for *weeks,* maybe even *months.”*



**(Pause)**



“That’s not uh- I didn’t mean it like that.”



**(Pause)**



“I meant that you look like you’ve been overworking yourself. Your posture is so tired - like, you look like a plant drooping because it hasn’t been watered enough. Hell, you look like you’re about to fall asleep right now.”



**(Pause)**



“Except that you do. Your head keeps drooping and you can barely keep your eyes open. I’m half expecting you to fall asleep standing up.”



**(Pause)**



“Well, then you should go lay down and get some more sleep then.”



**(Pause)**



“Work? Really? You think you’re going to go to work like this?”



*\*Narrator scoffs.\**



“Absolutely not.”



**(Pause)**



“Are you kidding? You’re so tired that you’re basically a walking mannequin. And not even a properly dressed one either - your shirt’s on inside out.”



**(Pause)**



“Don’t look so embarrassed. That kind of thing happens when you’re more tired than a bear who’s a month late for hibernation. Now really, tell me you’re not actually going to go to work.”



**(Pause)**



“Yeah, I’m serious. You can’t go to work like this-”



*\*Listener’s phone rings, cutting Narrator off.\**



“Is that your boss calling you? Here, I’ll answer it.”



*\*Narrator takes Listener’s phone and answers it.\**



“Hi, yeah, find someone else. You’re overworking your sweet employee here and it’s gonna need to be a sick day today.”



*\*Narrator hangs up.\**



“What? Why do you look so nervous?”



**(Pause)**



“He didn’t say anything, I hung up before he could.”



**(Pause)**



“He deserved to hear it. I've seen the hours you leave for work and get back home; he's *clearly* overworking you. You need time to rest and recover from work like that, and he's going to give it to you one way or another.”



**(Pause)**



“Yeah, he is. Because you're not going in today.”



**(Pause)**



“Nope. You’re going to stay home, and you're going to sleep in and rest.”



**(Pause)**



“Fine. If you don't want to stay home today, then you don't have to. You can come to *my* apartment and rest.”



**(Pause)**



“You can't tell me you're surprised right now. I'm going to make you rest one way or another.”



**(Pause)**



“Why not? It’s my apartment, I have people over if I want to. It’s not like the world will end if you cross the threshold of my earthly domain. Now come on, you’re coming with me.”



*\*Narrator opens the door to their apartment, walking inside.\**



“C’mon. Get in here.”



**(Pause)**



“Obviously, I meant it. I’m gonna make sure you get the rest you need, now really, come inside before the bugs start getting in.”



*\*Listener enters Narrator’s apartment and Narrator shuts the door behind them.\**



*\*Playfully sarcastic\** “Look at that. You’re in my apartment, and nothing’s exploded yet. It’s a miracle.”



**(Pause)**



*\*Amused\** “Calm down, I’m just joking. Like I said, you’re allowed in here. I’ll even say that I’m happy to have you here.”



**(Pause)**



“Yes, **really.** Now quit looking so scared. And come over here while you’re at it; standing right by the door isn’t any way to help you relax.”



**(Pause)**



“C’mere, sit on the couch. I dragged some blankets over here since I was watching some movies last night. Feel free to make yourself comfortable. I’m gonna grab you something to wear because that uniform looks uncomfortable.”



*\*Narrator leaves the room. Listener stands there awkwards for a few moments before sitting on the couch. After another few moments, Narrator returns.\**



“Here. It’s an old hoodie I got from a concert that ended up being a few sizes too big. But hey, it’s still pretty cozy. You can go ahead and change, I’ll go to the kitchen and make us something to drink and grab a few snacks. Sound alright?”



**(Pause)**



“Okay, good. Then I’ll be back in a couple minutes.”



*\*Narrator leaves to the kitchen, a door shutting behind them. While they’re gone, Listener changes into the hoodie and sits back on the couch. There’s the sound of a few dishes/ceramic mugs moving around before Narrator walks back to the living room. They gently knock on the wall to get Listener’s attention.\**



“Are you dressed yet?”



**(Pause)**



“Good. Then scoot over a bit so I can sit next to you.”



*\*Narrator sets a few cups/plates on the coffee table.\**



“And here’s this. I wasn’t sure which you’d prefer, so I made tea and some hot chocolate. You can have whichever you want, or both. It’s up to you.”



**(Pause)**



“Yeah, No problem. I also grabbed a couple snacks, so you’re free to have some of those too.”



**(Pause)**



“What do you mean?”

  
**(Pause)**



*\*Sarcastic\** “Oh, so I can’t be nice to my neighbor, can I?”



**(Pause)**



“Just because I want to. Do I need to have an ulterior motive?”



**(Pause)**



*\*Amused\** “Hey! I’m not a jackass *all* the time.”



*\*Narrator laughs\**



“I mean, I can be nice sometimes. I’m being nice right now, aren’t I?”



**(Pause)**



“Like I said, because I want to.”



**(Pause)**



“Well, because I think that you deserve it. You’re a pretty cool person and a nice neighbor, so I wanted to help you out. You’ve been working yourself too hard, you need to give yourself a break. It’s pretty obvious that you’re close to getting burnt out and today was a perfect example of that. I just decided to step in before it got too bad.”



**(Pause)**



“Yeah, I think you’re pretty cool. In a bit of a nerdy way, but still. The nerdiness is endearing.”



*\*Narrator chuckles.\**



*\*Amused, a bit flirty\** “What? What’s with that look? You’re looking a bit flustered there.”



**(Pause)**



“You know, looking away from me isn’t helping your case. If anything, it just makes you look even more flustered.”



*\*Narrator laughs.\**



“Hiding your face in the hoodie doesn’t help either. But, you know what might help?”



**(Pause)**



“Maybe, if you scooted a bit closer to me and hid your face in my neck, I wouldn’t be able to see how embarrassed you’re getting right now.”



**(Pause)**



“Yeah, I’m serious. Or would that make you even more flustered than you already are?”



*\*Teasing\** “Teasing you? I’m not teasing you. I’m just making a suggestion.”

  
**(Pause)**



“Well, it could be because I think that you’re pretty cute. Or because I want to get a bit closer to you. Could be either one, really.”



**(Pause)**



“So are you just gonna keep staring at me like that, or are you gonna come here and let me wrap my arm around you for a bit?”



*\*Listener moves over on the cough, sitting closer to Narrator.\**



“That’s it, come here. Get up close to me so I can wrap my arm around you. Lean in, just like that.”



*\*Listener and Narrator begin to cuddle.\**



“There. Now I can’t see how cute you get when you’re embarrassed. Isn’t that better?”



**(Pause)**



“It may have been a trick, but I think that you like the cuddles just as much as I do.”



**(Pause)**



“Your silence speaks volumes, cutie.”



*\*Narrator laughs.\**



“Alright, let me turn on a movie real quick; that way you can really relax, and maybe if I’m lucky, you’ll even decide to take a nap on me.”



*\*Narrator turns on the TV and the sound fades out as the audio ends.\**

- Slight increase in burping. I rarely ever burp at all, so it was enough for me to notice. It wasn't excessive or annoying, and they weren't ""sulfur"" burps either. 

- Right upper abdomen ""twinge"" pain within hours of injection. Not sure if referred pain or also a mental thing. In the days following, I'd get that same twinge feeling on the upper left side (stomach) right after meals, which was definitely real. 

Appetite: 
My appetite was slightly, but noticeably suppressed. For context, I am using sema to treat BED. I still binged at the same frequency as usual, but with less quantity of food. My ""stopping point"" came sooner than it usually does. 
Another appetite thing I noticed, I drank way less coffee and caffeine overall, it's kind of freaky. I'll go the whole day with just one coffee in the morning...

Weight: 
My weight fluctuated throughout the week as normal, and I did not lose weight. I am mostly-accurately tracking calories and was not in a deficit due to binging, but I am confident it will be easier to maintain a deficit as the medication builds up in my system and as the dose increases.

1gkjxwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1gkjxwe/an_ongoing_story_of_love_ill_update_as_it_goes/,An ongoing Story of Love - I'll update as it goes along [November],"Well, I guess I'll join in. Here's a story of love, still ongoing. As you see it's extremely long. But if you interested in the thorough thoughts I had, feel free to settle in, grab something to drink:

I recently started connecting with a girl I’ve had an interest in for a while now. Initially, I only saw her in university lectures early in 2024, and, as someone who thought it wise not to approach a girl solely because I found her attractive, I initially dismissed any notions of connecting with her. She has brown hair that reaches down to her shoulders, is quite short even for a woman, and has innocent eyes. Despite her fluffy, cute face with a natural blush, she has a lightly defined jawline that frames her extremely well. Her hair is usually slightly wavy, falling to her shoulders, with a curtain of bangs framing her face, and sometimes she wears it in a ponytail.

**March - June 2024**

So how did I end up connecting with her? Well, I’m from a country where people live rather close together. The country is small, and public transport is ranked among the best in the world. It is cost-efficient, clean, and on time. In addition, my university isn’t a destination for most international students, so I deduced quite early that she must be from the same region. One day, a few months after I first saw her, I was on my way home at night and coincidentally met a female friend from my old middle school. We talked, had some fun reminiscing, and as she’s quite the romantic, she asked me if I had a love interest. Initially, I said no because, as mentioned before, I had no ambition to approach this girl. However, my friend kept asking. How did she look, what did she study, etc. Her questions became more and more specific until she pulled out her phone and showed me, by god, a picture of her.

I was stunned. How could this be? There were 400 students in the room, and somehow I had run into a friend who used to be the best friend of my love interest. They went to school together in 7th and 8th grade before they parted ways for middle school. So my friend suggested I reach out to my love interest and pass along her best regards. And so, a week later, I did.

I had planned everything out. I must admit that I am not a shy person; normally, I have no difficulties approaching anyone if I have a clear intention. But this time was different. The intention wasn’t really sincere. Yes, I wanted to pass on the regards, but in the end, it was only a cover-up. As I approached her, I was confident. Everything was going fine, though she looked rather “grumpy.” She seemed disinterested, maybe even annoyed. Her attitude was so strong that for a moment, I thought about abandoning the idea. But something pushed me forward, and I kept going.

When I asked her if she was this person, let's call her Adornia, she took her time reacting. She stared into her laptop before giving me a side-eye and answering, “Ehhh, yes?” Without even thinking, I smiled and said, “\[Her friend\] sends her best regards!” Suddenly, she was shocked, giggled, and smiled. To say the least, she was an entirely different person, jolly, curious about how I knew her friend. We had a short two-minute chat before class began again. It was a good chat, and I’d made an impression that, at least, was not negative.

After that, I had only occasional chats with her during breaks and in the hallways, but nothing serious. The relationship between us was good and courteous, though I felt nervous every time I approached her. That’s when my friends started noticing, and I admitted to them that I had taken an interest in ""Adornia."" They were extremely supportive and still act as my wingmen to this day.

**Exam season - June 2024**

So many weeks went by, and I still hadn’t gotten her number – and exams were starting. Due to the nature of our study program, I wouldn’t see her after exams since we weren’t studying exactly the same thing. We’d only shared the same program during the first year. I knew I had to make a move, in some way, now. So, in the first week of exams, I asked for her number on Friday. This encounter, at least from my perspective (though many have assured me it was only my strict perception), was a mess. I was shaking, forgot my own phone number, and even entered it wrong. Yet she was still friendly and maybe even found it entertaining. So, bad luck with a dash of good fortune. We started chatting, and on the second-to-last day of exams in mid-June, I asked her over WhatsApp, ""How about we go for an ice cream after all this is over? \^\^""

She took a bit to reply and then answered, ""Hey, I’m not sure if I can come because I’m quite sick. Can I decide spontaneously tomorrow?"" I respected her message completely and, following Occam’s razor, assumed she was telling the truth. She wasn’t a bad person. In fact, right now, she’s pretty much the kindest person I know, always apologizing for the smallest mistakes. Despite that, I thought it might have been a soft rejection. Nothing that made me feel bad or sad - just the slightest bit disappointed.

The next day, I went in to write the last exam. It was over 25 degrees, and there was no doubt she was sick; she arrived with a jacket and a scarf around her neck, her face pale. She hadn’t been lying. So, after the exam, I approached her, intending to tell her to get well soon and not to worry about the ice cream. But, incredibly, before I could even say what I wanted to, she brightened up and told me she’d like to go for ice cream right now. I only asked if she was sure, and she said yes. Her female friend who was beside her asked if she could come along, and we both agreed. If Adornia had wanted to be alone with me, I wouldn’t have known; it was totally fine with me that her friend came along.

We ended up having a lovely afternoon, enjoying some great gelato and getting to know each other better. I learned what she was studying exactly (business, while I studied economics), why she chose it, and about her interests. She was a gymnast and trained two or three times a week. It was a jolly time, and in the end, after a good two hours, she had to leave for her training session, naturally not wanting to be late. We hugged, and things started to quiet down. For me, it was a happy start to the summer break and the holidays.

**Summer Break / Summer holidays - June to September 2024**

She rarely messaged me, and I rarely messaged her. However, after about a month and a bit, I asked her how her holidays were (she went to Namibia) and if she was satisfied with her grades. For the longest time, I received no response. Time went by, and, well, I thought maybe she wanted to cut ties since we wouldn’t be seeing each other anymore. Again, I wasn’t defeated, just a bit disappointed. I enjoyed my holidays with friends, even traveling to another country for a week (I don’t travel often). During this trip, she finally responded! She told me she had cut the internet and was simply enjoying time away from civilization. Just her family, her camera, and a notebook. She told me she was very happy and satisfied with her grades (I would later find out her grades were actually superb). She had just one more exam to take, and since I’d already taken it earlier, she asked if I could help. I gladly accepted.

I revised my notes, made them clearer and more detailed for someone else to read, added comments, highlighted important points for the exam, explained its structure, and so on. I sent her my files, and eventually, we also met to go over everything. She even helped me prepare for an exam I had failed on my first attempt.

Fast-forward: we both passed the exams with flying colors.

**3rd Semester of University - September 2024 - today**

The university started again in its third semester, and our contact slightly increased. We were in touch about twice a week, sometimes meeting in person. Feeling encouraged by our good connection, about three weeks ago, I asked her to go for coffee. And honestly, I think it was clear to both of us that this was an informal date. If I learned anything about her, it’s that she’s incredibly intelligent - and I believe she knew from our first meeting that I was interested in her. She replied that she didn’t know if she had time, and, well, that was it, I thought - a friendly, soft rejection. On Monday, I went to university and told my friends, with a smile and a soft voice, “I think it’s over. I tried.” I didn’t even explain the situation to them, but they knew.

There wasn’t a lecture that day, so I had a four-hour break. I decided to go home and return later. On my way back, I heard a notification through my headphones. It was from Adornia. It said, “Hey! I could make room on Wednesday!” Obviously, I felt a bit rejuvenated. I took my time to think of a response and told her that Wednesday after university was perfect for me.

We met on Wednesday, and it was a wonderful time. We took a stroll through town before settling down at my favorite coffee shop. We laughed a lot and got closer. She even admitted that, strictly speaking, she wasn’t actually free from lectures yet; she had skipped it to have coffee with me. And that’s the last significant story I have to tell.

Since then, our contact has increased again. We meet informally about once a week during a break, chatting and catching up.

And as of November 5th, that's the stand.

If you have read this far, thank you for your interest. I don't believe this is some post that most will read because it's so damn long. But if you have any suggestions of how I should approach this or how you'd approach this, I'd love to hear. If you were me, how'd you ask a girl for a relationship or should I, as I plan now, just let it develope naturally?

In all honesty, I don’t believe she’s into me romantically. And that’s alright. I live a good life, I’m happy, and I’m glad to have her in my circle. If something happens, it’ll happen. If not, it’s okay. I’m young, and the chances of us ending up together long-term are slim. In fact, I partly see it as a bit of fate that, through sheer coincidence, I learned that an old friend of mine used to be her best friend. If, on that cold winter day, we hadn’t met by chance and he hadn’t asked me about my love interest. yes, all this would’ve only been a dream.",1,1730847547.0,love,1,1.0,False

I (18F) met a guy (18) on Tinder after my friends convinced me to try it, and we’ve been hanging out for a month and a half now. Our first meetup was casual, we walked to the city centre, got coffee and paid separately. We ended up back at his place, talked for hours then kissed and touched but it didn’t go any further. The next day was similar (talking and kissing) and he mentioned he’d recently broken things off with an ex from another country which was an online, long-distance relationship that ended for good before he and I matched on Tinder.

Since then, we’ve been talking daily on Snapchat and kept up a Snapstreak. We’ve exchanged flirty pictures (topless) but he’s never pressured me for anything more, which I appreciate. He makes some light sexual innuendos or teases about other guys but at the same time, I’m noticing mixed signals. For example, I suggested we go see a film together, he agreed, but he didn’t follow up on planning the date. One night, we went to aa fast food place, and while he paid for himself, he pointed out that I could order from another screen. Another time, he wanted to pick up a takeaway but he didn’t offer to share his food though he did walk me back after (we live in the same student accommodation block as we're both university students)

He’s told me he’s “too mentally exhausted” for a relationship right now, which makes me wonder if he just sees me as a friend. But he’s still flirty and sometimes hints that we’re more than friends. When it comes to anything sexual, though, he’s a bit reserved/shy. He avoids talking about kinks and tends to joke or change the topic if I bring it up. I jokingly bit his neck lightly once, and he told me he’s not into things like that but that's the most I've gotten out of him. So, I’m unsure if he’s just uninterested in going further in that way (for reference we're both virgins and both a bit shy).

Another thing I find odd is that he’s never complimented me or told me anything like that directly. It feels strange, especially since he’ll flirt but won’t actually say anything affectionate. I also usually have to initiate our conversations, and his messages often come late at night (around 1 a.m.), though I’ve managed to get him to start replying a bit earlier. He seemed slightly annoyed when we lost our Snapstreak because I was busy, but now it’s been almost two days without him messaging, and I’m curious to see if he’ll make the first move.

We have chemistry and get along well, but his actions are confusing. He’s friendly and engaging when we’re together, but he doesn’t go out of his way to make plans, pay, or show direct interest. I don’t want to seem clingy or put all the effort in myself, but I can’t tell if he’s just interested in friendship or something more. Should I wait to see if he reaches out more, or should I ask him directly what he’s looking for? How can I gauge his interest without putting myself out there too much?

Tips or advice would be appreciated and are welcome please :-) ",1,1730847065.0,dating_advice,3,0.99,False
