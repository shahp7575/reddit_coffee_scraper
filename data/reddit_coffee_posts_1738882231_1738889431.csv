1ijiiel,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultBedwetting/comments/1ijiiel/a_word_of_caution/,A word of caution,"Hey all,

I have struggled with this for the past several years and wanted to give you some insights as to how this issue developed and what I think caused / accelerated its progression. And ultimately, give people some caution that might inadvertently cause this issue or exacerbate it to a point of no return. 

I'm male, and this issue started for me in my late 20s. I had no prior events / experiences with bed wetting even as a child. The progression started with more frequent night time urination. Eventually this led to me having to wake up three or more times per night which caused excessive daytime drowsiness. Because I have some light insomnia, waking up multiple times and struggling to get back to bed was a terrible experience. I ended up bringing this up to my doctor, who mentioned the likely cause was too many liquids before bed. I didn't like this explanation because really nothing regarding my diet ever changed, and my fluid intake remained constant. Up until this point however, I never wet the bed nor did I ever have any concerns that I would. 

After a particularly troublesome week with waking up constantly and getting little sleep, I was searching for answers online and eventually discovered that some people manage nocturia through wearing diapers. I mulled this over for some time, but eventually bought some with the intention of wearing them to bed, using them in bed to prevent having to get out of bed to use the bathroom, thus allowing me to fall back asleep more quickly and regain some of my lost sleep. Getting accustomed to this was weird, and I had to overcome some pretty big personal barriers before I gave it a shot (namely, embarrassment for having to order and wear diapers). But eventually I decided to try it because I could not bear losing any more sleep.

This started off fantastic. I was able to adapt relatively quickly and the diapers worked as intended. I regained hours of lost sleep and felt much better throughout the following day. Around the three month mark however, I realized that I would stop waking up on certain occasions, or at least wasn't remembering doing so but would wake up with a wet diaper. By month 6, I essentially wouldn't wake up in the night any more but would always wake up wet. At first this didn't really concern me. This was during the pandemic, and I pretty much was relegated to staying home and I lived alone. I guess I never really thought about me becoming dependent on them, and thought by not wearing diapers I would simply wake back up like I did before. 

I decided to test this theory and well, let's say that I didn't wake up. So now it seems that I essentially either have to retrain my bladder, or I'll be forced to wear diapers to bed every single night for the remainder of my life. This kind of sucks financially as the premium ones can me expensive, and also is embarrassing when travelling or visiting my parents.  I have not discussed this with any friends or family or doctors out of embarrassment.

I guess at the end of the day, I am happy that I am getting great sleep every night. But I'm not so sure I would have pursued this if I knew that I would end up with this condition. You guys don't think this is indicative of any underlying issues with my bladder, right? Like I'm not actively losing continence? I don't really ever have any issues during the day. Sometimes if I drink coffee I'll have to urgently use the bathroom about every 30 minutes, but I feel that this is normal considering coffee is a diuretic. 

If anybody else has nocturia and is considering wearing diapers to bed as a solution, be forewarned that you may go down the same road I have gone.  ",1,1738889320.0,AdultBedwetting,1,1.0,False

1ijiazm,https://www.reddit.com/r/cagayandeoro/comments/1ijiazm/whats_with_the_hate_train_on_warning_people_where/,What's with the hate train on warning people where they shouldn't buy their coffee.,"There‚Äôs a lot of negativity surrounding certain coffee shops, yet most of it lacks proper facts and context. Many complaints focus primarily on pricing or ownership‚Äîsuch as targeting businesses owned by the Villars‚Äîwhile ignoring the fact that many other cafes charge just as much, if not more, without facing the same scrutiny.

I refuse to blindly jump on the hate train when accusations without solid evidence say more about an agenda to tarnish a business‚Äôs reputation than about the business itself. This isn‚Äôt about defending any particular shop‚Äîit‚Äôs about recognizing that pricing complaints are often personal and subjective, especially when people continue to patronize these establishments. If a coffee shop is truly ‚Äúthe worst,‚Äù then there should be objective reasoning, not just vague claims fueled by bias.

Supporting lesser-known or local coffee shops is great, and I encourage it. But spreading misinformation or unfairly fixating on pricing only misleads others. If the goal is to make informed choices, then discussions should be based on facts, not assumptions.

A Constitutional Perspective on Responsible Discourse

My intention with this post is to encourage everyone to remain objective and to always question the motives behind accusations or negativity, especially when it involves a business or an individual. Unless facts and evidence are properly presented to corroborate a claim, we must be mindful of the principles enshrined in our constitution that safeguard fairness and due process.

Article III, Section 1 of the Philippine Constitution states that ""No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws."" While this primarily applies to government actions, the principle extends to public discourse‚Äîmeaning that no individual or business should be unfairly judged without basis.

Furthermore, Article III, Section 4 upholds ""the freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press,"" but this right comes with the responsibility to avoid misinformation, defamation, or baseless accusations. Freedom of speech should empower truth, not be a tool for unjust condemnation.

We may have a flawed and sometimes corrupt system, but that does not absolve us from upholding fairness and rationality in our discussions. If we demand accountability from businesses, let‚Äôs ensure that we apply the same standards to ourselves‚Äîby prioritizing truth over speculation and facts over assumptions.",3,1738888699.0,cagayandeoro,2,1.0,False

1iji6xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iji6xu/yesterday_i_was_asked_if_i_remembered_the_first/,"Yesterday, I was asked if I remembered the first time I felt like something was deeply wrong with my mom.","I was ten years old. My grandma - mom's mom - liked to make a trip out of Christmas shopping, and this year she had booked a small cabin in one of those ultra-cute winter towns that are hoppin during the season. She was driving and my mom was in the passenger seat.

The sun went down and forced me to put down the book that I had been buried in. I hadn't checked in on what was happening in the car for a few hours but the shift in mood was palpable. Mom and grandma always had a tense relationship, but this felt different. Darker, somehow. Without even hearing a word yet, anxiety began to churn in my gut and I tuned in to the conversation.

""[Mom's name], what the hell is wrong with you?!"" from grandma. Her head rapidly snapped back and forth between watching the road and staring at my mom, mouth agape and her expression a strange blend of fear and anger.

In the dark of the back seat, I quietly shuffled over to get a look at what was happening in the passenger seat. What I witnessed may have made me laugh in any other scenario, but right in that moment the only thing I felt was that something was obviously, terrifyingly, not okay.

My mom had taken her shoes and jacket off. She was digging through her purse, speaking incoherently. Two pairs of sunglasses covered her eyes and she was trying to put on lipstick but kept falling asleep and stabbing herself in the face with it. My heart hammered in my chest and I weakly called out ""mom? Are you okay?"" only to discover that she had no idea who i am. I begin to sink into the most severe panic attack of my life up to that point.

""Goddamn it, [mom's name], i am pulling over and getting you a damn cup of coffee! You're not making any sense!"" grandma was yelling at my mom, but i could sense the fear in her words. She was afraid of what was happening. She was mad. Why?

We pulled off the highway and haphazardly parked at the end of a long single-lane diner. Old school east coast style; all neon and chrome. Now out of body, I see myself open the car door and step to the gravel. I notice my mom is still not wearing shoes. She wanders in a Z up to the glass door, babbling nonsense and pinging off of any obstacles. I shut her door for her while my grandma whispers harshly under her breath. I decide to bring up the rear so mom can't wander off or fall down. Snow is lightly falling.

The blast of heat and glaring flourescents of the diner sharpen my focus momentarily and I begin to take in our surroundings. Being dinner time, the tables are mostly full. Conversations messily overlapped in a cascade of language as we made our way to the back right to claim one of the last booths. As we move down the aisle, these sounds began to subtley shift until it was absolutely unmistakable: they were laughing at her. They were laughing at the crazy shoeless lady in two pairs of sunglasses inside in the dead of night. I whipped around, heart in my throat, and watched these strangers watch her. Tears stinging in my eyes, i sank down on the bench seat in defeated shame. I knew i didnt have the courage to say something or protect her.

The waitress came to our table to take our order. Grandma tersely ordered for herself and my mom. When that woman turned to me, I finally broke. Its the first time I remember being openly pitied. I ran off to the bathroom and threw up several times. I don't remember anything after this.



Now, as an adult with context I can tell you this: she was high. It was the beginning of the opioid crisis, she was a nurse, and she was in progress of being diagnosed with an ambiguous but severe chronic pain condition. She essentially had an open script to whatever she wanted, and what she wanted was benzos and opiates. Go figure. She did add her own unique flavor to it with a crippling addiction to ambien, which is what brought on this bout of incoherence, hallucinations, and overall confusion.

Her diagnosis is questioned to this day. She cannot control her own medication. Mentally she's capped around the age of 14 and is entirely dependent upon everyone around her.

There was a lot of abuse. A constant cycle of get drugs > forget child > run out of drugs > take withdrawal out on child. As a result, I don't remember much. As a result of her drug use, she remembers even less. My grandma is dead. I am the only person that knows about this and I just wish I didn't.

1iji2o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dopabeane/comments/1iji2o2/fuck_hipaa_after_the_week_i_had_my_own_patient/,"Fuck HIPAA, after the week I had my own patient file is about to double in size, and I'm here to tell you why","So there‚Äôs so much that happened before and after Jack‚Äôs interview that I don‚Äôt think I can get to it all, but I‚Äôll try.



My stress levels were off the charts. I couldn‚Äôt eat and could barely work.



Christophe noticed and tried to cheer me up, which failed. Finally he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in the interview with you. Jack asked for me to come.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe get along.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou never told me that.‚Äù



He shrugged. ‚ÄúRafael and I brought him to the Pantheon. He is used to hiding, I think, because of how he looks. When we met, I did not react to how he looked except to say I liked his shirt.‚Äù



My stomach churned a bit as I recalled Jack‚Äôs report and the description of his physical condition.



‚ÄúBut I am used to people who look and smell dead even though they are not.‚Äù He hesitated. ‚ÄúI try to keep from being friends with other inmates and the research subjects.‚Äù



*What a great job you do,* I thought but didn‚Äôt say.



‚ÄúBut Jack wanted to be my friend. He did not have any, so I did not tell him no.‚Äù



I then asked Christophe what he knew about Jack in order to make myself feel better. It backfired spectacularly; after several minutes of halting conversation, Christophe revealed the full extent of Jack‚Äôs fear and other complicated feelings for his mom ‚Äî in other words, about an abusers who is genetically identical to me.



‚ÄúHe will know you are not her,‚Äù Christophe assured me.



I didn‚Äôt believe that for a second ‚Äî and felt it was entirely unfair to expect it of Jack besides ‚Äî but it felt unkind to say so.¬†



That did nothing for my steadily mounting stress levels.



Christophe spent the morning in my orbit while I wrote up notes and prepared files. In the afternoon, he waited outside the cells while I conducted appointments with other patients. Every time I came out and saw him waiting, I felt a little calmer.¬†



That realization paradoxically made me feel less calm.



As the day wore on and Jack repeatedly postponed the interview, my anxiety metastasized into something almost unmanageable.



It finally eased when Charlie popped in and told me, ‚ÄúJack‚Äôs still having trouble. It‚Äôs probably not going to happen tonight, so if you don‚Äôt hear from me in the next half hour, consider yourself done for the evening.‚Äù



I waited in the conference room, partly because my room was still freezing, partly because Christophe was still with me and I wasn‚Äôt entirely comfortable having him in my room. Especially not after the mess the Harlequin made of the blazer he left behind. I still haven‚Äôt told him about it. I‚Äôm not even sure how.¬†



As if reading my mind ‚Äî although he was probably reading my smell or something, which I guess is close enough ‚Äî Christophe asked, ‚ÄúDo you want to talk about when I came into your room?‚Äù



I could tell by his voice that this was painful for him, which made it less painful for me. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù



‚ÄúI think we do. Did I upset you?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



I could practically see him fighting the urge to cringe. ‚ÄúWas anything I told you wrong or unwelcome?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo. Not even a little, but next time we talk like that, neither of us can be drunk.‚Äù



A massive amount of weight seemed to slide off his shoulders as he sprang out of his seat and took the one next to me. It was maybe not entirely what I was hoping for, but it was also not something I wasn‚Äôt hoping for, either. ‚ÄúI am not drunk now.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know.‚Äù



‚ÄúI also don‚Äôt know how to talk about what I want to talk about.‚Äù Suddenly the invisible weight piled right back onto his shoulders, and I knew what was coming.¬† ‚ÄúBut I do know that I do not have to be drunk to want to do this.‚Äù



He leaned in. Before I could think, I made myself lean in too.



It was short, simple, solemn, charmingly chaste.



And it melted me.



I don‚Äôt know how to describe it except to say it was the only kiss I‚Äôve ever had that was both objectively underwhelming and subjectively perfect in every way.



He pulled away, looking about as scared as I‚Äôve ever seen him. I didn‚Äôt want him to be scared, so I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt have to be drunk to want to do that.‚Äù



And of course that‚Äôs exactly when Charlie marched in to tell me Jack was finally ready.

  


The interview was devastating, but I handled it reasonably well.



Afterward, Christophe tried to follow but I waved him off politely. ‚ÄúI think I need to be alone.‚Äù



He obediently fell back. ‚ÄúIf you need anything, come to me.‚Äù



‚ÄúI will.‚Äù



I paced my half-frozen room for a while, turning Jack and Asher and their interviews over and over in my mind, but didn‚Äôt get anywhere.



I didn‚Äôt want to stay in my room. I didn‚Äôt want to go to the cafeteria, either; even though it was late, there were too many people and it was noisy.



So I decided to hide out in the conference room.



I knew immediately that it was the best decision I could have made. It was nice, dark, clean, and above all, quiet. Unlike the cells, it‚Äôs totally insulated from inmate and cafeteria noise. It‚Äôs probably the quietest room in the facility. I wondered why they couldn‚Äôt make the cells half this quiet.¬†



After an hour or so, I decided I might as well sleep in there. Quiet, isolated, and warm ‚Äî well, not warm, but at least not frozen ‚Äî and impersonal? I wasn‚Äôt going to get anything better.



So I crept out to my own room, grabbed a pile of blankets and my favorite pillow, and crept back. I set up a pallet in the best corner. Then I pulled out my voice recorder and tablet, and listened to Jack‚Äôs interview again. I took notes. Some were for work, some were for me.



I listened to it three times in a row. In the middle of the fourth run, the door opened and Christophe came in.



Looking at him made me feel equally uncomfortable and relieved. I pulled my earphones off. ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt is very late.‚Äù His voice and his face were uncharacteristically gentle.¬†



‚ÄúI know, but I don‚Äôt think I can sleep right now.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt strictly true. What‚Äôs true is I was afraid of sleeping. I have nightmares every other night as it is. After talking to Jack, I suspected actual night terrors were in store.



‚ÄúYou should try.‚Äù He looked at me shrewdly. ‚ÄúAre you afraid of being alone?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, but it probably doesn‚Äôt help.‚Äù



‚ÄúI am afraid to ask this and I am sorry if it‚Äôs the wrong thing to ask, but‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said.



And just a few minutes later, he was back with his own bedding. He set up his own pallet a couple yards away and parallel to mine.





Since it seemed rude to keep working while he tried to sleep, I wrestled my bedding into position and settled down.



He looked over, vaguely horrorstruck. ‚ÄúWhy is your pillow like that? What did you do to it? And why are you laying like that?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs how I sleep‚Ä¶?‚Äù



‚ÄúBut your neck is‚Äî‚Äù



‚Äú‚Äîcomfortable.‚Äù



‚ÄúGet a different pillow at least. Yours looks‚Ä¶*broken*.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù



Still looking moderately horrified, he said, ‚ÄúOkay, but I think it is no wonder you have nightmares.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry it upsets you.‚Äù



‚ÄúI am not upset, I am disturbed.‚Äù



That made me laugh a little too hard for a little too long, which in turn made him look quite pleased with himself.



‚ÄúI am going to turn off the lights so I don‚Äôt have to be disturbed anymore,‚Äù he said.



I burrowed down into my blanket cocoon, then realized it was too warm after all and surreptitiously kicked off several layers.



But not surreptitiously enough, because he said, ‚ÄúGo to sleep, or I will leave.‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt. I will want to leave, but I won‚Äôt.‚Äù



‚ÄúI appreciate it. Good night.‚Äù



‚ÄúI would say the same except you can‚Äôt have a good night twisted up like that.‚Äù



‚ÄúGo to sleep.‚Äù



He did.



I didn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt, not after Jack. Not after seeing those holes burned into the air and the eyes behind them.¬†



But knowing I wasn‚Äôt alone kept me calm.



I talked to Eric first thing in the morning about possible treatment options for Jack.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm open to suggestions,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut please do understand that we‚Äôve tried many, many things.‚Äù



‚ÄúHave you tried asking some of the inmates for help?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes. We‚Äôve asked two.‚Äù



‚ÄúSena, right?‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù



‚ÄúWho else?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. We can‚Äôt ask them again.‚Äù



The warning in his tone was clear, so I kept going. ‚ÄúCould we maybe use Isam to‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know, try to defuse Asher? The one man bomb squad against the human warhead?‚Äù



‚ÄúI have no idea if that will work. I‚Äôm willing to try, but bear in mind Isam is supremely uncooperative. I would go so far as to say he‚Äôs as uncooperative as Asher.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know. But I‚Äôd like permission to talk to him anyway. And I have a few other ideas.‚Äù



He blinked tiredly. ‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù



After that reception, I felt like I was grasping at straws but kept going anyway. I mentioned Mrs. Stitcher ‚Äî (‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt consent to assist, but you can ask,‚Äù he said), Larry (‚ÄúHe seems to heal emotional and psychological injuries rather than physical, but we can try and Jack does have psychological wounds he might help with‚Äù), and Pierrot.



‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Eric asked.¬†



I explained about Pierrot‚Äôs honey.¬†



‚ÄúWhich he can only access from his little habitat under the bed, yes?‚Äù



‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat would be a containment breach. Administration will refuse, but it‚Äôs a good idea otherwise so I‚Äôll ask.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe might want to talk to the Swan King, too.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúI know Jack isn‚Äôt an environmental hazard, but Asher‚Äôs proximity seems to have damaged him in ways that aren‚Äôt the same, but not also *not* the same‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúGet to it, please.‚Äù



‚ÄúThere are similarities to the way Eli‚Äôs hurt. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same in any way, but if it is, the Swan King might be able to help.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôll send it up the chain.‚Äù



With that, I went on with my day.



As far as the Pantheon goes, it was a good one. I supervised a visitation between the Bye-Bye Mommy and Dolly Doe. It went beautifully. If it keeps going beautifully for another four months, they‚Äôll be allowed to share a cell. Eric even said we can host an adoption ceremony. It sounds stupid, and maybe it is, but I think they‚Äôd both love it.



After that, I talked to the Swan King ‚Äî not about Jack (that wasn‚Äôt approved yet) but whether he‚Äôd be open to potential T-Class reclassification.



‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm only willing to do work you can guarantee won‚Äôt be undone. Without that promise, no.‚Äù



On a whim, I asked if he missed Aeristyra. That seemed to surprise him.



‚ÄúThe longer I‚Äôm away from it,‚Äù he said slowly, ‚Äúthe more it feels like a nightmare. But the longer I‚Äôm here in your Pantheon, the more I remember that I *am* a nightmare. So‚Ä¶yes.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you miss Darcus?‚Äù



‚ÄúEvery moment. But the distance is its own relief.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow?‚Äù



‚ÄúSometimes I like remembering that I‚Äôm a nightmare. I don‚Äôt remember that when I‚Äôm with her.‚Äù



With the unsettling sense that he‚Äôd just peered straight into a level of my soul even I wasn‚Äôt aware of, I asked if there was any junk food he was partial to and rattled off the options in the break room.¬†



‚ÄúNone of that, but I‚Äôll take one of the of the chocolates in your pocket, now and any other time you remember. And I‚Äôd like more visits like this. I don‚Äôt often get to talk. I‚Äôm listened to even less.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt anyone listen?‚Äù



‚ÄúListening only tends to happen when equality is assumed. Even those who assume it can‚Äôt always listen to me. You didn‚Äôt either, not at first.‚Äù¬†



I weighed this. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. Thank you for your honesty. In the spirit of honesty, the people you listen to seem to end up better off. I‚Äôd like to be better off, too.‚Äù



After that, I headed straight for La Dama and her first non-investigative session.



I had no idea what to expect, but even so it was entirely unexpected.



The second I sat down, she held up her hands. The three small, beautiful eyes embedded in each glimmered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell you what I see you for you. It‚Äôll be quick.‚Äù



Feeling frightened but eager, I nodded.



‚ÄúNothing is set in stone, so everything changes all the time. You‚Äôre not any different. For you, sometimes I see stars. Sometimes a circus. Sometimes wings. Sometimes there‚Äôs a forest. Sometimes there‚Äôs only the Pantheon. Sometimes there‚Äôs fire. Sometimes there‚Äôs a little village with lights in all the windows. Sometimes there‚Äôs only darkness. There‚Äôs always a wolf. Sometimes he‚Äôs happy. Sometimes he‚Äôs angry. Sometimes he‚Äôs rabid. And he‚Äôs always starving.‚Äù



‚ÄúI appreciate that,‚Äù I said, even though my mind was spinning and I felt vaguely ill and massively confused. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm still here to talk about whatever you want to talk about.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already done that.‚Äù



With that, she cut the session off.



After thinking for a few minutes, I went to see the Knotwitch.



But as usual, she pretended I wasn‚Äôt even there. There‚Äôs very little quite as unsettling as being treated as though you don‚Äôt exist by an entity that could most likely unexist you if she wanted.



I gave up and went back to my room, feeling rather hurt and super annoyed. I was even more annoyed when I realized the temperature was as low as ever.



When someone started pounding on my door a second later, unease overtook that annoyance.



But it roared right back when I opened up and found myself face to face with Merry. Birdy looked up at me, ruffling her ragged wings.



‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs movie time,‚Äù Merry said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre watching *Pacific Rim*. Mikey picked it. He also made a lot of popcorn. Like a ball pit worth of popcorn. I don‚Äôt even know where he got it all.‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time.‚Äù



‚ÄúTime isn‚Äôt something you have. Time is something you make. I insist you make time for this, only because I know you want to deep down. Come on. Let‚Äôs make it.‚Äù



That‚Äôs how I wound up watching *Pacific Rim* with Merry, Birdy, Mikey, Jesse, Lucy, and a handful of V2-Class Agents, two of whom were expressing relief at being off shift ‚Äî ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre practically dealing with a riot down in Ward 2 ‚Äî‚Äù and one of whom was the youngest worker I‚Äôve seen at the Pantheon. Her name was Carmen, she couldn‚Äôt have been older than twenty-one, and Merry‚Äôs behavior towards her was verging on slimy. Nothing in her body language indicated that his behavior was welcome, so when he got up to grab something to drink, I slid into the seat beside her.



*Thank you*, she mouthed.



Mikey came by a minute later, wrangling several tubs of popcorn. He shoved one into my arms and one into Carmen‚Äôs.



Merry then reappeared with a Sprite in one hand and a coffee in the other. I tensed slightly, but he cheerfully sat down on my other side and slurped his coffee. ‚ÄúI want to be vegan, but breves exist. Do you want a breve? I‚Äôll make you one. I make great breves.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, but thank you.‚Äù



‚ÄúYour loss. Carmen?‚Äù



‚ÄúDefinitely not.‚Äù



‚ÄúLet me know if you change your mind.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to.‚Äù



He cracked his soda open as obnoxiously as possible and slurped that too.



One thing I will say is that *Pacific Rim* is a lot better than *Samurai Cop.* Maybe that‚Äôs why Merry wouldn‚Äôt let me enjoy it.



Less than ten minutes after the movie started, he leaned in close. ‚ÄúSo, now that we can talk without the big bad wolf snarling every time I say your name, how are things?‚Äù



‚ÄúSome are fine, not are not so fine.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true,‚Äù Birdy said.



‚ÄúWhich things are fine, and which aren‚Äôt fine?‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Can we ‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lie,‚Äù Birdy interrupted. ‚ÄúShe knows.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs Christophe one of the things that are fine?‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat true,‚Äù Birdy said helpfully.



‚ÄúSpeaking of Christophe,‚Äù I hissed, ‚Äúwhy do you treat him like that?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause he reacts. He reacts better than anyone I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù



‚ÄúThis is true,‚Äù said Birdy.



‚ÄúYou should try making him react sometime,‚Äù Merry told me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be good for him.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lie,‚Äù Birdy told me. ‚ÄúSeriously. That‚Äôs the *biggest* lie he‚Äôs told you.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so rude, Birdy.‚Äù



‚ÄúCan you shut the fuck up?‚Äù Mikey said.



Merry did not shut up. He just got quieter and talked a lot faster. I assumed it was in retaliation for Carmen.



By the end of the movie I was so mad I could have strangled him, and made the ill-advised decision to tell him so.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm flattered! And actually not at all opposed, but Christophe‚Äôs feelings would be hurt, and that‚Äôs not *quite* the reaction I was talking about when ‚Äî‚Äù



I left before he could finish and hid in my room, where I had a completely unexpected and massively delayed breakdown about Jack.



At this point, the Harlequin came gliding out of my closet and made me an offer:



He‚Äôll save Jack if I kill Asher.



To use Merry‚Äôs phrase, I‚Äôm not at all opposed.



The problem, of course, is how to accomplish it.



Every idea I had felt stupider than the last. Soon I was stuck in a spiral of frustration and self-doubt. My room felt cold and hostile besides, so once it was late enough I bundled up my bedding, a book, and my last bag of chocolate and escaped to the conference room.



I wasn‚Äôt entirely surprised when someone knocked an hour later.



‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I said.



It was Christophe, freshly showered and lugging his own blanket.¬†



As he set up his makeshift bed, I said, ‚ÄúI heard you had a crazy day at work.‚Äù



He shrugged. ‚ÄúFor whoever you heard it from, maybe, but not for me. I got to do all of the things I am good at for the whole day.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù



‚ÄúAn inmate learned how to unlock the cells without leaving his own. We had to find out which inmate, which took a very long time because we were busy putting everyone back in their cells. I did most of the putting back. Then we had to find out how to stop him from unlocking the cells again, which did not take very long at all. I did most of the stopping.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo I want to know?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúProbably not. Tell me about your day instead.‚Äù



I told him in broad strokes, reluctantly finishing with the movie. As expected, he was distinctly unthrilled, but he relaxed a little when I finished with, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm never doing it again.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood. What are you eating?‚Äù



‚ÄúChocolate.‚Äù



‚ÄúI want some.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs it safe?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶dogs aren‚Äôt supposed to have chocolate, so‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúDo I look like a dog?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, definitely not, but like‚Ä¶the whole wolf thing‚Ä¶? You lean into it really hard, and like..I know you get kind of wolfy sometimes, like when you were helping Courtney with that asshole, and‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyebrows were traveling higher and higher up his forehead, and I was faltering besides, so I gave up. ‚ÄúI just wanted to make sure.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, you have. And I appreciate it, but I will appreciate eating them more.‚Äù He snatched the bag and poured half of it out before tossing it back. ‚ÄúHow is ‚Äî‚Äù



Before he could finish, the door ricocheted open and Merry flounced in, carrying a sleeping bag and a clear plastic bag of leftover popcorn almost as tall as I was. Birdy bobbed after him, ragged feathers shimmering.



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said.



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He plopped down between me and Christophe, which put him far too close to both of us.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not enough space for you here,‚Äù I said.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true. However, strictly speaking there wasn‚Äôt enough space between me and Carmen for you either, so really it‚Äôs only fair. But who cares about fairness? All I care about is friendship. It‚Äôs the responsibility of friends to keep each other in check. You kept me in check today, and to that end l‚Äôm really happy to be attending a sleepover with my good friends tonight. Here, have some popcorn.‚Äù



He lobbed the bag at Christophe, who for all his protestations looked distinctly wolflike in that moment.



‚ÄúBefore you throw me across the room,‚Äù Merry said, ‚Äúfirst, understand that against my wishes and yours, I‚Äôll enjoy it. Second, I need to talk to both of you because they‚Äôre probably going to reclassify me to an inmate.‚Äù



Christophe looked even more startled than I felt. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not important.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lie,‚Äù said Birdy.



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs important is that they‚Äôre probably going to do it soon. That means if I‚Äôm lucky, I‚Äôll get to be in Ward 1.‚Äù



‚ÄúWon‚Äôt they make you T-Class?‚Äù Christophe asked.



‚ÄúMaybe. After what happened, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù



Christophe‚Äôs expression was of grudging admiration. ‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù



‚ÄúI already told you that doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù



‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying,‚Äù Birdy told me.



‚ÄúI hate admitting this, especially to the Agency‚Äôs favorite pets, but I am very scared and very anxious,‚Äù Merry said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also somewhat offended because Dr. Wingaryde wants to code-name me ‚ÄòThe Magician,‚Äô which I find both juvenile and strangely offensive. And I wanted to talk to both of you ‚Äî mostly Christophe, but both of you ‚Äî about what it‚Äôs like to be an inmate here. Don‚Äôt downplay it, don‚Äôt try to make me feel better. Just tell me what it‚Äôs like. Everything you can think of. The bad, the super bad, and the worst.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt is not all bad,‚Äù Christophe said. ‚ÄúFor you, it might not be bad at all.‚Äù



And with that, he launched into a long and thoughtful explanation that prompted so many questions from Merry that I lost count. Christophe answered every single one.



Or at least I assume he did, because I fell asleep before they were done.



When I woke up the next morning, Merry was sleeping on the opposite side of the room, wrapped in his sleeping bag and two blankets I recognized as mine. Despite that, Christophe was noticeably closer to me than he‚Äôd been the night before. But they were both peacefully asleep, and I noticed that both the popcorn and the chocolate were gone.



Their conversation picked up when they woke and continued over breakfast. I left them to it, but on my way out of the cafeteria, Charlie caught me.¬†



‚ÄúYou and Christophe need to attend mandatory counseling tomorrow at 8:30,‚Äù he said briskly.



‚ÄúCounseling for what?‚Äù



‚ÄúI think you know. My office, tomorrow, 8:30.‚Äù He went into the cafeteria to tell Christophe.



After that I had a session with Love. Charlie attended and quickly took the lead and not to be rude, but thank God because I was so out of my depth I was basically soaring in the air far above anything that could be considered a depth.



After that, I received permission to speak with Isam. He was polite, even gentle, but refused to engage beyond pleasantries.



After that I had a session with Babygirl. As always, I brought chicken cooked to her enthusiastically and inexpertly described specifications.



She ate it all in two bites and told me it wasn‚Äôt as good as her Mom‚Äôs, but ‚Äústill mostly okay.‚Äù



One update I didn‚Äôt get to is that now that he‚Äôs here in the Pantheon, Merry is assigned to the search for Babygirl‚Äôs mother. When I told her, she was so happy she danced. It was unnerving as fuck, like a Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark illustration turned to flesh, but it made me smile anyway.



My last session of the day was with Camila.



It isn‚Äôt easy spending time with her, and not through any fault of hers. Quite frankly, she‚Äôs amazing. But I feel guilty every time I speak with her, and I think that‚Äôs a rational and deserved response. Everyone here ‚Äî Christophe especially ‚Äî put her through hell and she has nothing to show for it but permanent servitude.¬†



It took me a while to decompress from our meeting. I spent that whole while holed up in the conference room working on documentation.



Near bedtime, I ran to my room for bedding and immediately noticed it was warm.



I thought of Camila and almost stayed. I even settled in for the night.



But my resolve didn‚Äôt last, and I went back to the conference room.



Merry was nowhere in sight, but Christophe was already there



He looked exhausted, but still smiled. It was difficult to smile back, which he noticed. ‚ÄúDid you have a bad afternoon?‚Äù



Since I can‚Äôt really lie to him, I said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù¬†



He didn‚Äôt pry. I wondered what he sensed, and whether it translated into specific knowledge. The look on his face made me think it probably did.



‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúIt was a very busy day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI spent it doing things I am good at again. I‚Äôm tired and I will probably fall asleep fast.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably beat you there.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen you should turn off the lights. That way I won‚Äôt be disturbed by your broken pillow or your broken-looking neck.‚Äù



I obliged.



He fell asleep almost immediately. I didn‚Äôt. I browsed on my phone to make myself feel better, the success of which you can gauge by the comments on my last post.



I didn‚Äôt feel better. I just ended up obsessing over Asher and Jack again.



To that end, I woke Christophe up, partly to ask several questions, partly because I was jealous that he was sleeping soundly and I wasn‚Äôt.



Since I didn‚Äôt want to bombard him with a heavy topic the second he woke up, I started off with something lighthearted, which didn‚Äôt go badly but also didn‚Äôt go well.¬†



After that, I circled through a few other topics and finally told him what the Harlequin offered ‚Äî to save Jack if I kill Asher.



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù he said immediately. ‚ÄúNot for any reason. I mean of course kill the fucker if you can figure out how. I will help. But leave the Harlequin out of it.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably right.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúI know I am right. Now,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbecause you woke me up, you have to help me get back to sleep.‚Äù



My hackles went up just a bit. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can sing me a lullaby.‚Äù



They went down again. ‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Any one you like. Choose.‚Äù



Feeling stupid but amused and vindictive enough to really go for it, I started *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.* He closed his eyes until the end.



Then‚Äî



‚ÄúThat was a very nice effort, but it was not actually nice, and it not how you sing a lullaby. Here, listen. I will show you how.‚Äù



He had to wait, which he did quite patiently, until I was done laughing.



Then he started to sing. I didn‚Äôt recognize the lullaby ‚Äî didn‚Äôt even understand the language he used ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt need to. And he was right:



I have no idea how to sing a lullaby, especially not compared to him.



By the time he was done, I was drowsy. ‚ÄúThat was so nice.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt was better than nice. Now, you still have to help me fall asleep. Since you cannot sing, you can tuck me in.‚Äù



‚ÄúFor real?‚Äù



‚ÄúIs there a not real way to tuck in someone?‚Äù



I clambered to my feet and mimicked what I did the night he was drunk, right down to smoothing his hair back from his face. ‚ÄúThere. Good night, Christophe.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt sleep very well.



Judging by how quiet he was, I don‚Äôt think he did either.



Yesterday was actually uneventful as far as the Pantheon goes. I didn‚Äôt even have an interview or a session. It was all paperwork and preparation for intake evaluations tomorrow.



I did camp out in the conference room again last night even though my room is reasonably warm now, where I tried and miserably failed to teach Christophe to play Pokemon Go.¬†



But the fun started afresh this morning with our mandatory counseling session with Charlie.



When I showed up at Charlie‚Äôs office, Christophe wasn‚Äôt there. Lateness is unusual for him, which I told Charlie.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because he isn‚Äôt late. I had you come early because need to talk. I was just going to have you stay after, but I‚Äôve been told that you and Christophe refuse to part ways during meetings.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe have good reasons.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd I have a good reason to talk to you alone.‚Äù



I wanted to argue, but every instinct I had told me to listen quietly.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all glad you and Christophe are‚Ä¶working together.""



His tone told me all I needed to know. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶?‚Äù



‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he agreed.



He watched me carefully. Charlie has eyes that are almost honey-colored, and they‚Äôre usually warm. While that warmth is clearly deceptive, it‚Äôs nice.



But no warmth was there now.



Finally he said, ‚ÄúThe Khthonic process is one we don‚Äôt really understand, even after decades of research. The one thing we do know is that it results in changes that align with the victim‚Äôs own wishes. The Bye-Bye Mommy transformed into her profoundly flawed understanding of a good mother. Babygirl respawns without any injury or damage to fulfill her mission, just like a video game character. Dolly Doe is more complex on the surface, but I believe ‚Äî as I‚Äôm sure you do ‚Äî that the absence of anything that could force her to remember who she is or what she suffered is key. As you know, Camila became untouchable in the ways that mattered to her and that she understood.‚Äù



I waited.



‚ÄúChristophe is the same. The reason he‚Äôs physically imposing, highly intimidating, and incredibly strong not only in practice but in appearance is because that is what the truest part of him wants.‚Äù



I knew where he was going, but I wanted to be wrong.¬†



‚ÄúHe cares about you, probably more than you know and possibly more than want. It‚Äôs obvious to everyone but you that you reciprocate.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut,‚Äù I said again.



‚ÄúBut this relationship is changing him into what he didn‚Äôt ‚Äî and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äî want to be.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhich is?‚Äù



‚ÄúDiminished, unexceptional, unremarkable, toothless, and weak.‚Äù



‚ÄúHe seems pretty happy to me.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because of his unhealthy and ultimately unsustainable desire for approval from people he cares about. The person he cares about most is you.‚Äù



I fought the urge to fidget, and pretended to be oblivious to the fact that I was blushing.



‚ÄúHe wants to be what you want. Without consciously realizing it, he‚Äôs trying to change himself to align with what you want him to be. You‚Äôre responding positively. And of course you are. It‚Äôs impossible not to respond to someone who reflects what you want, particularly with the chemistry you two appear to enjoy. But the change isn‚Äôt making him happy. Your approval of current behavior is making him happy.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat exactly are you ‚Äî‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúWhat you want Christophe to be isn‚Äôt what he wants to be, and it isn‚Äôt who he is. That may never occur to him, but I think one day it will. And when it does, the fallout will be destructive for both of you. I‚Äôm not trying to scare you, but you need to be aware.‚Äù ¬†



There was so much I wanted to ask about this, but every instinct was suddenly screaming at me to ask him something else.



So I did.



Packing every syllable with all the compulsion I could manage, I asked, ‚ÄúAm I related to Eric?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow?‚Äù



‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your half-brother.‚Äù



Shock shattered my concentration, which broke my power.



Charlie didn‚Äôt look remotely fazed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt force you to do anything. We both know that. Still, I advise you to keep that to yourself. It‚Äôs not a threat. Just a recommendation, and mostly because I‚Äôm lazy as hell.‚Äù



I was saved from responding by Christophe, who at that moment entered.



‚ÄúSit,‚Äù said Charlie.



He sat next to me.



Charlie surveyed us both, looking even more tired than Eric. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually know how to counsel an intensely emotional woman who somehow fails to recognize that she is actually feeling those emotions any more than I know how to counsel a man who is simultaneously experiencing life as a forty-year-old, a fourteen-year-old, and four-hundred-year old.‚Äù



‚ÄúI think I am actually five hundred,‚Äù Christophe said.



‚ÄúI appreciate your input, but it doesn‚Äôt change my larger point.‚Äù



‚ÄúAccuracy is important. You have said so to me many times.‚Äù



Charlie‚Äôs eyes looked a little flinty. ‚ÄúI was going to apologize for what I‚Äôm about to subject you to. I was even thinking about skipping some of it. But I‚Äôm not sorry anymore.‚Äù



His lack of sympathy was on full display as he queued up a series of generic and weirdly old corporate training videos regarding workplace relationships, sexual harassment, and professional conduct.



I was bored and embarrassed.



Christophe started off irate, at one point asking, ‚ÄúHow is this relevant? We are not doing anything they are saying ‚Äî‚Äù but the videos were so unintentionally awful that he ended up quaking with semi-silent laughter by the halfway point, and didn‚Äôt stop until the end.



‚ÄúGood job, guys,‚Äù Charlie said. ‚ÄúCome back in fifteen minutes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy? We‚Äôre done.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done with the one-on-one counseling, but the group session starts at 9:30.‚Äù



I could have cried. ‚ÄúGroup session?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, group session. You two aren‚Äôt the only ones engaging in unprofessional conduct around here.‚Äù



It was torture, but at least we weren‚Äôt the only ones being tortured.



The training consisted of several sections. While Christophe and I were both there for what Charlie‚Äôs PowerPoint presentation termed *potential romantic misconduct*, there was a section on insubordination that was directed at me, and a section on personal safety that was clearly directed at him.



A section on workplace intoxication was obviously aimed at Mikey, who showed up drunk. I think ‚Äî well, hope ‚Äî it was intentional. When Charlie snapped at him, he pointed out that it was his day off.



Several V2 agents were present for a section on gossiping, plus a section on workplace safety violations. That must have been directed at Christophe, too, because some of the V2s high-fived him at several key points.



Love was there, and had a section tailored especially for them about how literally turning yourself into your coworkers isn‚Äôt allowed.



Gabriella was there too for a section about the unprofessionalness of encouraging your coworkers to engage in unnecessarily risky behavior, and a V-Class Agent named Garrett was there to review a section about engaging in unnecessary risky behavior.



A doctor assigned to the Medical Division had a whole section on medical ethics. At the end of it, she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I disagree, but how am I supposed to do my job?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, Dr. Vargas, I think it‚Äôs self-explanatory‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm Dr. Hyde.‚Äù



Charlie frowned. ‚ÄúAre you assigned to the Medical Division?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm assigned to Research and Development.‚Äù



Charlie briefly closed his eyes. ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs been a mistake. I apologize. You‚Äôre dismissed, I guess.‚Äù



This sent Mikey into a laughing fit. When Dr. Hyde gave Charlie a disdainful glare that was equal parts mean girl and imperial royalty, I joined in. ¬†



‚ÄúPlease, everyone,‚Äù Charlie said, ‚Äúgive me a break. This is your last chance before Administration comes down on you.‚Äù



Merry asked, ‚ÄúAre they going to come together or are they going to come separately?



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre starting and I don‚Äôt want to know. I just want you to stop.‚Äù



When it was finally over, Charlie passed out tests. The sight of his test made Mikey dissolve into helpless laughter. Since he was clearly in no fit state, I went ahead and took his test for him. Charlie didn‚Äôt even try to stop me.



A couple of hours later, I was summoned to the director‚Äôs office. I knew exactly why, of course.



When I arrived, he made a big production of wanting to walk me through the exterior perimeter security measures to familiarize myself with facility defenses.



Once we were out past the perimeter fences, I said, ‚ÄúHalf-brother, huh?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe have the same bio-dad?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù



‚ÄúHave I met him?‚Äù



Eric looked so stressed I almost felt sad for him. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point telling you.‚Äù



‚ÄúI beg to differ, bro. Is it Charlie?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, although that‚Äôs a very good guess. Who told you he‚Äôs an inmate?‚Äù



And I knew.



Just like that, I knew.



‚ÄúIs my dad ‚Äî my actual father ‚Äî the goddamned Harlequin?‚Äù



His silence said more than words ever could.



I sat down in the snow.



Eric sat beside me with an impressive lack of difficulty.¬†



‚ÄúWhy do you have your last name?‚Äù I asked accusingly.



‚ÄúBecause of my mother. The conception was purposeful, but it didn‚Äôt work out. He disowned me the day I finally learned about it for being unoriginal, boring, and too much like my mother.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo we know how he met my mom?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù



‚ÄúDoes everyone here know?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo. Just you, me, Charlie, and him. We didn‚Äôt even know about you until he told us.‚Äù



‚ÄúDoes everyone know about you?‚Äù



‚ÄúAbsolutely not. I didn‚Äôt even know until I was‚Ä¶fifty-five? It was a deathbed confession from my mother.""



‚ÄúHow does Administration not know?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause when the Harlequin breaches containment, no one knows what he gets up to unless he tells them. There‚Äôs a risk that he‚Äôll tell everyone about us one day, but not a particularly big one. He doesn‚Äôt respect Administration ‚Äî he finds corporate structure unforgivably boring, and he thinks Admin are unworthy of anything that would be entertaining, including exciting disclosures. And if he changes his mind, Charlie‚Äôs on hand to keep them in the dark until we figure out what to do.‚Äù



‚ÄúI hate this.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo do I. Do I have to tell you to keep this from Christophe?‚Äù



‚ÄúI guess not.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood. It‚Äôs cold. Let‚Äôs go back.‚Äù



I went straight to my quarters where I saw a file on my bed. Written on the folder in handwriting I somehow recognized even though I‚Äôve never seen it was a note:



*I have your second mostly unredacted file, darling girl.*

*But this isn‚Äôt it.*

*It‚Äôs the redacted version.*

*This is because we NEED to discuss the unredacted version before you read it (not least because of the headache-inducing involvement of your bad dog, my grandson, our bomb boy, the endlessly helpful Michael, and a magician), but I just don‚Äôt feel I have the capacity for this conversation right now.*

  


*When that changes, I‚Äôll let you know.*

  


*Your father,*

  


*Arlecchino*





I opened the folder and started to read.





**Interview Subject: Wendy Darling**

**Classification String: Uncooperative / Destructible / Gaian / Protean / Critical / Egregore**

**Interviewer: Michael W.**

**Interview Date: 10/31/26**





**\[INTERVIEW REDACTED - DO NOT RELEASE\]**



SUMMARY:



This highly unexpected interview occurred after the inmate‚Äôs infiltration of AHH-NASCU.

During the interview, this inmate (formerly T-Class Agent Rachele B.) gleefully provided a great deal of highly troubling information that will remain classified for the foreseeable future in order to prevent unnecessary panic.



Broadly speaking, the interview consists of the details surrounding the inmate‚Äôs catastrophic entry into the City Bright.



The inmate claims that she has successfully conquered half the city after gruesomely disabling the Harlequin by committing acts ‚Äúthat can only be done in the City Bright.‚Äù¬†



She also excitedly detailed her curation and acquisition of certain individuals that she very recently kidnapped for the express purpose of providing services within her half of the City Bright.



Despite the powerful inter-Agency defenses mounted against her, it must be noted that this inmate successfully kidnapped approximately half the inmates in Ward 2, as well as Uncontainable #3.¬†



Most concerningly, she also kidnapped T-Class Agent Christophe W., who is the only individual capable of destroying her.¬†



Despite extensive efforts on the part of B-Class Agent Merrick A., Christophe has not been recovered.



When asked why she kidnapped Christophe given their extremely tumultuous personal history, she responded, ‚ÄúBecause I love lost boys. He‚Äôs the lostest of lost boys, so I love him most.‚Äù



Based on the information gathered during this interview, the inmate was reclassified to Egregore status.





\* \* \*



Honestly, I was annoyed.



Like I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been that annoyed in years, not even at Merry. It took all my self control not to throw the file into the garbage.



And for the first time since he started his intrusions, I hoped the Harlequin would show up.



Of course he didn‚Äôt.



So I went directly to his cell. He was pretending to sleep, but his favorite rage song ‚Äî *Gimme That Boom* by Skindred ‚Äî was playing, which meant he was mad as hell. It was not lost on me that the thing he was mad about could very well be the interview where my future self mutilates him and steals his home, so I backed away slowly.



Anyway, that‚Äôs been my week so far.



I don‚Äôt know.



I‚Äôm stressed, my head hurts, I feel sick, and I think I‚Äôm about ready to go get drunk with my nephew.",8,1738888029.0,u_Dopabeane,0,1.0,False

I was wondering if any of y'all have had tics, particularly breathing tics, that get so bad you end up nearly or completely passing out? I know that since it happened to me it's likely that there are others, but I'm feeling pretty shaken as its the first time its happened to me, and I think I just want to hear it from others that I'm not alone.

I feel particularly crushed by the looks of my classmates, as I was with my class when it happened. I'm very antisocial, I don't really have close friends and I recognize I can be a bit prickly, and when I try to correct that I just come off like a doormat. That is to say, seeing my peers look at me with mild annoyance and discomfort was almost more distressing than my conversation with the floor of a nearby coffee shop. 

I'm kind of torn between the fear of it happening again and not wanting to be alone right now and the utter humiliation that's making me want to sink into the floor.

If any of you guys are reading this and feel similar throughout your experience with this disorder, whether it be the fear of what could happen or the embarrassment and loneliness, just know that this random teenager cares for you, and even though I don't know any of you personally I think of you often and I hope you're all doing well.

My espresso tastes sour, you can‚Äôt taste much of anything else, 

[bottomless 54mm portafilter]

[Grind size and bean amount] 
I‚Äôve tried various bean amounts and grind sizes, 
I used to use 18 grams for double shot, with a 4 grind size, however still barely any pressure and very sour, so I tried 7 grind amount with 16 grams, then 1 grind with 16 grams, then 12 grind with 16 and 18 grams, and 4 5 2 and 8 grind sizes with 16 grams, and no change in pressure or taste to the level I wanted, still sour, 

[puck prep] [tamping]
I‚Äôve tried tamping around the edges more, I used to think it was because the stock tamper didn‚Äôt tamp the edges of the portafilter that I bought, causing channeling, but I know now that the tamper fits the 54mm the same as the stock portafilter because there both 54mm, 
I also tried tamping harder or softer, relatively the same result, very little pressure and super sour, 

[mixing a little with the metal prong thing]
The device with th little metal prongs that you use to break up the grinded beans in the portafilter before tamping, I found that even if I only mess with the top, it still causes the pressure to be worse, if I don‚Äôt touch the beans at all with the metal pronged thing, then the pressure improves a little but the puck becomes soggy and misshapen, I try my best to tamp evenly however I ordered an even tamper to help me 

[shots] 
I mix my shots after extraction, they come out pretty hot, and I‚Äôve pulled dozens and dozens with only a little change, even when the pressure is better finally after trying, it never reaches espresso range and the taste remains better but still disgustingly sour, not how I like it, I‚Äôve pulled a good shot before but I tried the same thing and it didn‚Äôt work out at all, 

[beans] 
I use freshly bought French roast ‚Äústrong and rich‚Äù arabica whole bean coffee, dark roast, from Trader Joe‚Äôs.

[I also compared both portafilter and their size is the same except one gets smaller at the bottom and the other does not] the one that stays the same size thru out the filter is the one with pressure issues, however both portafilters give me relatively gross sour shots] ",1,1738887679.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1ijhx17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijhx17,Wellness Yerba Mate from Hugo - Review,"Hi again, I am reviewing the Wellness Yerba Mate this time, from Hugo.üòä They really liked my last review, so they wanted to know what I thought of one of their other blends. 

Their Wellness Yerba Mate, is advertised as formulated for woman. With the added ingredients: Chamomile, Dried Apple, Green Tea, Rosehip Peel and Dried Hibiscus. This blend is said to help with energy, metabolism, regulating blood sugar, general wellbeing, satisfying cravings, calming your mood along with your digestive system, and gives your skin a healthy radiance. Thank you Hugo for this lovely experience! 
(Disclaimer: I was sent this Yerba Mate for an honest review.) 

The Yerba: 
[Look] 
Like the last version it has cut leaves and very little stems. There is no noticeable dust. You can see the pieces of dried apple, rosehip peel, and dried hibiscus. There are also some rolled pieces of leaves that might be the green tea. It‚Äôs a nice looking blend. 

[Scent] 
The dry yerba has a nice sweet fruity smell. Along with some warmer dried fruit notes. As I continue to smell I can definitely pick up on the greener notes of the yerba and probably some of the green tea. All in all, this makes my mouth water. I need to try it, now! üòäüíñ

[Taste] 
This blend is good to be brewed with both a french press, and the traditional way. I recommend 160F / 71C, or lower when brewing because of the green tea. Super hot water makes it super bitter. 
(French Press)
Like the last blend, the yerba mate is very smooth. Not much bitterness at all. There is some natural sweetness from the yerba, and the apples. I also detect a tiny bit of tartness on the end of my tongue, which is probably from the hibiscus and the apples. I don‚Äôt really taste the chamomile or green tea much, but I do feel the usual calming effects. I really enjoyed this. 
(Traditional Gourd)
Using the gourd I taste more of the tartness from the hibiscus. The apples flavor is noticeable, but the hibiscus really shines here. Maybe I didn‚Äôt have enough in the French press. I‚Äôll have to experiment more.
(Final Thoughts) 
This blend was a very enjoyable drink. The combination of flavors is pretty balanced, and I like the tartness. The energy level is decent as well.

  Well for this story we need some information, I'm Gabi, my sister we'll call her Li and her friend we'll call her Isa, I'm 23 years old and they're both 19. Li and Isa have been friends for about 10 years, becoming friends soon after Li ended a friendship and Isa supported her, over the years this girl became something for Li like ""the sister I never had"" and we interacted several times over the years, from birthday parties to nights. pajamas. Until an incident occurred where I took the girls who were probably 13 years old to a swimming pool, where while we were having fun in the water, Isa's bikini simply came off when she was close to me in front of me as if...it was for me to see and logically I ended up seeing it, I apologized and she apologized; Well, it could have just been my impression but I had seen her purposely untie her bikini to, let's say, ""show me the contents"" but it could have just been my impression.
  Years went by and no such incident happened again until somehow (despite barely leaving the house and only to work at a mall coffee shop and play games in my free time) I managed to find a girlfriend, I dated her for 2 years and in the meantime we did ""couple things"" if you know what I mean. Good; In the end we finished. And in the time after my breakup until my next relationship other incidents happened.
  Several times when Isa was at my house talking to my sister and the door was open, she always tried to fill me with someone or in front of my door, leaving Li against the door so that she thought she was looking at her when, in fact, she was looking at me, or she said she was leaving and walked past looking at me, trying to hide it, but it didn't work, I noticed this every time. Until in 2021, one night when Isa came to sleep at home in Li's room, until she came to the room, opened the door and... she was wearing a towel. Then he made an excuse that he was looking for my sister while he kept looking at the area below my belly and then he left. After that, I got another girlfriend who I dated until June last year, but something I noticed during the time I dated this girl (let's call her Ju) was that unlike my sister who adored her, Isa avoided being in the same room as her, staying only when necessary and always staring at her breasts, or when I was with Ju, staring at me. Something that bothered her was one of the reasons for our breakup.
 *Pause for me to describe the characters in the story. I'm 23 years old, I'll be 24 in April, physically I look a lot like the actor Tom Holland, the only difference is that I wear glasses and have a thin beard. My sister Li, who turns 20 this year, reminds me a lot of Ellie from ""The Last of Us Part 2"" but with brown hair that reaches her shoulders. And Isa, who also turns 20 this year, looks practically like Marvel's Wanda actress (I don't remember her name right now unfortunately) but with a ""bubble butt"".
  Well, after all this context, it's finally time to tell you what happened. And well... about 3 months ago my sister said that she would like me to take her and her friend to the beach and that they would pay for a separate room for me but as long as I took them since they didn't have money for two plane tickets (we live a 5 hour drive from the beach) but I refused since I had to work. More or less a week later she asked if I really wouldn't go and used her same argument as when we were children ""Aren't you really going? Gabi"" I thought better of refusing and accepted. Over the past 3 months, Li and Isa came to my work a few times to confirm if I was going and they always asked for something, and while they waited, Isa would usually glance at me from the corner of her eye, in addition to always saying how excited she was for the trip, always asking me if I was too.
  Finally the day arrived, I woke up at two in the morning and went to pick them up, I picked up Isa first since she lives nearby and then I picked up my sister. And after 2 stops and 5 hours in the car, we arrived at the beach at 10 A.M. But when we arrived at the inn, my sister asked for the key to both rooms, but the girl said that she had only rented one room, which, after a lot of conversation, the girl said that the inn considered that she had selected only one room (as mine was the one she asked for later, as I wasn't planned to go initially) the girl apologized and then, to try to make up for the mistake, she returned the money for that room and gave us a room with a bed. couple and one single. We got comfortable, put our bags and decided that Li and I would sleep in the double bed and Isa in the single.
  We went to the beach and put on sunscreen and did ""beach things"", swam in the sea, ate portions of shrimp and potatoes, ate ice cream, etc. The girls went to walk along the beach while I took care of things, during that time I ate meat skewers and roasted cheese and believe it or not I was touched on the butt and called beautiful by a beautiful lady; until I simply fell asleep and when I woke up I was on Isa's lap while my sister was eating an ice cream next to me, I asked what was happening and they told me that when they came back they found me sleeping and Isa let me use her lap as a pillow, I thanked her for that and got up.
  We returned to the inn and there we relaxed in a turtle-shaped pool for some time. We went to our room and took a shower and when I got out of the shower just wearing shorts because I had forgotten to get the Isa shirt ""What a great body you have, right Gabi"" I took the shirt and quickly got dressed. We had dinner in a restaurant we went back and slept, when in the middle of the night I woke up looking at my sister, I turned my back and Isa was looking at me when he realized that I had woken up he pretended to sleep as quickly as possible I turned around again and tried to sleep as much as I could trying to forget about it.
  The next day we went for breakfast but the day started off strange as Isa was peeling a banana in a calm and calm way and when eating it she ""gently"" bit into it while looking at me, which I found very strange. At the beach we enjoyed the day like the previous one until I decided to get out of the water and Isa left soon after, a while later Li left too and went to look for an ice cream cart, when he walked away Isa asked me to put sunscreen on her which I thought was strange, but I accepted. At that moment I decided that on this trip I would confront her about all these moments, until I had the brilliant idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdrinking a few beers (there was no way I could have had a worse idea).
  Throughout the day I had between 4 and 6 300 mL beers, which left me a bit upset and I ended up forgetting to talk to Isa about her acting weird towards me. We all went back to the inn and next to the pool there was a sauna, which we relaxed in until dinner time.
  Well, we went back to the room, and while they were watching TV I closed my eyes to try to rest from the drinks I had had. When I was woken up by Li, she told me that Isa was vomiting, and that I was supposed to watch her while she went to the pharmacy, so I told Isa to take a shower and then go to sleep.
  And while I was watching TV she got out of the shower, came to me (only wearing a towel) sat next to me, and while rubbing my leg she said ""Don't worry, I just threw that green broth from the beach down the toilet and pretended to throw up. I don't have breath (she smiled)"" at that moment I remember taking off my shirt, giving her a kiss, taking off her towel and we started ""slutty""; I don't remember much but I remember it being the ""wildest hooray"" I've ever done in my life."" And the next day I woke up in my underwear, with a terrible headache from drinking and memory lapses from the day before, Li complained that I left Isa alone vomiting and went to sleep, something I accepted just to avoid causing problems. When she turned around, Isa came close to me and whispered ""Last night your little friend was great, right? Gabi.
  That day we returned home and I couldn't get it out of my head, and I started to think, had she been thinking about that since the pool incident? I had never thought of her that way. But what now? I feel like I betrayed my sister's trust, how can I fix this? Do I tell her? Do I talk to Isa about our relationship? It's been four days since I came back and I don't know what to do, help me.

I couldn‚Äôt see anything at first, but I knew immediately from the humming of some troubled sounding V8 and the rough undulating of my surroundings that somehow while I was passed out I had been dragged from the gas station and was now riding in some stranger‚Äôs car. Maybe not the weirdest thing to happen to me whilst traveling through the desert, but jarring nonetheless.¬†  
  
¬†¬† I realized I was in the back seat of the car when I put my hands forward to feel the back of the passenger seat, and I could see the lights of the dashboard coming from the gauges up front, though I couldn‚Äôt see the lights from the center of the dashboard with the radio and A/C. The driver of the car was a completely dark silhouette that I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to tell was there if it weren‚Äôt for the dashboard lights, the cigarette that was lit in his right hand lying on the center console, and the shadowy figure of his left hand gripping the steering wheel.¬†  
  
¬†¬† Though I was unsettled by this change in surroundings, I didn‚Äôt really feel as though I was in any kind of danger, since otherwise I‚Äôd be sideways in the trunk all tied up with rope and tape over my mouth (which I‚Äôm well familiar with). I attempted to get the driver‚Äôs attention. ‚ÄúHey! Who are you? Where the hell am I? I‚Äôm gonna be really pissed off if you didn‚Äôt wait for me finish shitting myself before dragging me into this goddamn thing.‚Äù I already was kind of pissed off since I hadn‚Äôt gotten the chance to wipe before I fell asleep, and I could still feel the consequences of that. . .  
  
¬†¬† The driver didn‚Äôt respond however. He kept staring dead ahead without a single flinch into the abyss, speeding forward through a darkness so intense that not even the headlights of the car could penetrate. That was the most frightening thing of all, because earlier when I was driving myself it was one of those picturesque nights in the derelict part of the country where the sky and the ground were both being illuminated by the stars and the moon. Now, no matter how much I tried to squeeze my eyes into adjustment, I couldn‚Äôt see a damn thing out of the window.  
  
¬†¬† I couldn‚Äôt see what the speedometer was saying, but I could tell by the pitch of the gurgling engine and the intensity of the car‚Äôs rocking motion that we were moving pretty fast. ‚ÄúHellooo??‚Äù I blurted out at the man again. I felt for the red button that‚Äôs supposed to eject the seatbelt buckle, but when I found the button, it was completely jammed. I was locked in place. ‚ÄúUm. . . .can you at least pull over and undo this seatbelt so that I can get my ass off this seat and put my pants back on?‚Äù. Still no response from the man. ‚Äú. . . .I mean it‚Äôs. . . .hell it‚Äôs not like I can just run off through the desert. Who am I gonna ask for help, the vultures?‚Äù I said, getting the impression that the man still thought of me as just one of those scummy coward thugs who‚Äôd kill a whole family before I‚Äôd let anything bad happen to myself.  
  
¬†¬† ‚Äú. . . .Oh believe me. . . .‚Äù, the man finally said before taking a drag off his cigarette, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre way better off in here than out there. . . .‚Äù. The man then took his cigarette over the passenger side of the car, the ashes still glowing, and flicked the ashes off into the footwell.¬†  
  
¬†¬† I knew that I had no right to argue with someone who would be insane enough to drag some seeming nobody into his own car and as a result probably outgunned and outwitted me, so in response to his statement I simply laid back in my seat with a sense of inadequacy, and stared back to my left where the window was, and it was all still pitch black. My head, still throbbing with a tremendous headache, was swirling with the thoughts of who this man was and what he planned to do with me, and I thought about what I would do if I somehow made it out of this situation alive and how I would explain to the boys in Pie Town that I spent several hours with my ass exposed in the backseat of the boogie man‚Äôs rotten old sedan without them thinking that I had fucked around with my drug collection whilst traveling. . . .again.¬†  
  
¬†¬† ‚Äú. . . .How about some music?. . . .‚Äù Said the man spontaneously, and then he reached into the glovebox and pulled out an 8-track which I couldn‚Äôt see the label of in the darkness. He then said, ‚ÄúI could go for some noise right about now‚Äù, before inserting the thing into the darkness of the dashboard. What began blasting from the crunchy speakers of the car was what I could only describe as a caterwauling cacophony of rock instruments playing alongside multiple bellowing vocalists shouting impromptu gibberish.¬†  
  
¬†¬† That‚Äôs not what bothered me though. What bothered me was that this was one of MY songs. In my youth when I was still with my high school friends, we decided that one day, when the mayor imposed some toothless noise regulation on our neighborhood, that we would form our own little garage band in an act of rebellion called ‚ÄúDissonance‚Äù. The one song that we ‚Äúwrote‚Äù was exactly what the name of the band implied. Borrowing equipment from the local college with the help of older friends, we settled into my garage and organized all of our instruments; each with our own microphone for us to vocalize. Then on the count of three we would use our instruments and our voices to strum and bash and scream a supreme shockwave of sound throughout the entire damn neighborhood.¬†  
  
¬†¬† We never recorded the song though; it was just one of those neighborhood anomalies that we never committed to recreating again when all the neighbors came bashing at our doors. So, realizing that the  
man had just pulled out a fucking 8-track of a song of mine that should be more lost and forgotten by the world than the whereabouts of J. J. Harding‚Äôs 157^(th) toe-nail clipping, I was actually starting to get somewhat frightened by this man.  
  
¬†¬† ‚ÄúHow the hell do you know about this song!?‚Äù I said, yelling over the speakers which were blasting my ear-raping song at full volume, ‚ÄúWhere did you get a recording of this!?‚Äù.  The man ejected the cassette from the player and said, ‚ÄúI guess I was just in the right place and the right time. . . .‚Äù, and then I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre freaking me the fuck out man, what do you mean by that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ¬†At this point, since I started to sense that he was willing to converse with me, and at that point I was completely losing my cool, I started bombarding him with repeated questions like some overbearing news reporter.¬†‚ÄúWould you shut the hell up?‚Äù He finally responded in a scolding tone of voice. ‚ÄúWhat I mean is, I was there to witness all of it. . . . To watch the whole shit-show unfold.‚Äù I barked back at him, ‚ÄúHow? I didn‚Äôt see your ass around anywhere when we were doing that, I don‚Äôt fucking know you man!‚Äù¬†  
  
¬† ¬†‚ÄúWell then, you slewy chicken-shit bastard. . . .let me shed some light on the matter for you. . . .‚Äù He reached his hand up to the roof of the car and turned the roof light on. My heart sank as I saw just how dirty and rotten the interior of the car was. Where there was once the plush and lustrous red leather interior of a classic Ford Galaxie was now a filthy metal cage, battered and torn¬†by the rage of some suppressed rabid animal.¬†In every corner of the car were cobwebs and rat nests of varying sizes, which were tucked behind piles of lousy woman clothing, beer bottles, ammunition boxes, lottery tickets, and many, many old receipts. . . .¬†  
  
   That's not what bothered me though. What bothered me is that this was MY car, and I was responsible for everything; every last speck of dirt. . . . I looked up at the driver, and was horrified to see that he was still completely pitch black despite the luminosity of the light above him. I couldn't even begin to process everything that I was seeing as I slowly turned and tilted my head towards it all. As I felt the crushing weight of hopelessness mashing and churning at my soul I screamed and thrashed all around me, but it was as if the abrasive seatbelt seemed to firm it's grip on me the more I struggled.

1ijhnmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForexCliobra/comments/1ijhnmx/what_is_forex_trading_a_beginners_guide_to/,What is Forex Trading? A Beginner's Guide to Currency Markets,"Ever wondered how people make money trading currencies around the globe? üåç

Let me break down Forex trading like we're grabbing coffee and chatting about the most exciting financial playground you've never explored.

# What Exactly is Forex Trading? ü§î

Forex - short for Foreign Exchange - is basically the global marketplace where currencies get traded.

**Quick Mind-Blowing Stat Alert:** The forex market moves a whopping **$6.6 trillion daily**. That's more money moving in 24 hours than most countries' entire annual GDP! üí∏

Imagine you're swapping dollars for euros, betting that one currency will rise against another. That's forex trading in its simplest form.

# Why Should You Care About Forex? üöÄ

Trading currencies isn't just for Wall Street wolves. It's for anyone who understands:

* Global economies are interconnected
* Currency values constantly fluctuate
* Smart strategies can turn market movements into profit
* You don't need millions to start - even $100 can kickstart your journey

# My Personal Trading Philosophy üí°

Since 2015, I've learned forex isn't about getting rich quick. It's about:

* **Understanding market psychology**
* **Reading economic indicators**
* **Managing risk like a pro**

# Forex Trading Fundamentals üìä

**Key Elements Every Trader Needs to Know:**

* **Currency Pairs:** Always traded in pairs (EUR/USD)
* **Leverage:** Allows controlling large positions with small capital
* **Pip:** Smallest price move in currency trading

# Risk Management - The Real Secret Sauce üîê

Most newbies blow up their accounts because they ignore risk. My approach?

* Never risk more than 2% per trade
* Use stop-loss orders
* Diversify your trading strategy

# Want Proven Forex Resources? üéØ

But I pretty much never get approached, which makes me wonder if I‚Äôm just not attractive or maybe look a little off.

Guys stare at times, and I know I stand out since I dress nicer than most people around here. I don‚Äôt go to bars since I don‚Äôt drink, but I do go to coffee shops and uni, and still, nothing really happens.

Since moving here, only one guy has randomly given me his number. I‚Äôve been called pretty or beautiful by catcallers or people on the street, but that doesn‚Äôt really mean much lol. 

I am pretty awkward at times and have a RBF which i feel gives a closed off vibe, but even when i try to do eye contact or look at them (which is my extent of approaching) they usually stare and not approach. 

I was on dating apps for a bit, and used to get hundreds of likes and messages (also doesnt mean much) from guys who i thought were ‚Äúout of my league‚Äù, and those same kind of guys would stare at times but again not approach. 

Ive been around my friends and they get approached by others, even those who arent guys seem to just spark conversations with them. Sometimes i wonder if i am just not attractive and thats why people dont approach, or if my vibe is off putting. ",2,1738886796.0,dating_advice,19,0.63,False

The S/O didn't want to spend the money and was dismissive. The person got disappointed and the S/O ended up getting them one after the fact and didn't think it was a big deal. I felt bad for the person and then they wrote something like, it wasn't about the cake but it was about the cake. It was about being placated and not actually cared about. Something in me broke a little after reading that.
One year, for my birthday, I made a coffee and chocolate cake for my friends that were visiting from out of state and my fiance at the time. I like baking for people and I took extra time and care to make it look good. Frosted it really nice, added strawberries on top. It looked super edible. My friends had to cancel because they had to drive through an ice storm to get home and didn't want to wait Incase it got worse. I was disappointed, but glad they didn't stay because it did end up getting worse. Told my fiance they weren't coming and she just said "" okay"" and went back to ignoring me. She had been very cold and distant to me for a week or two and when I brought it up she said everything was fine. I later found out she was cheating on me with one of her friends and when she ignored me to be on her phone, that's who she was interacting with. She had told him how annoying I was being that day. Later we ate cake in almost complete silence. I asked her why she didn't get me anything or try to do anything for my bday. She said she thought this was it, my friends visiting and that she didn't think I wanted anything else. I don't make a huge production out of the day, but I like to do things and I appreciate meaningful gifts. It's something we did for each other for every special day, so I was really confused by her answer. The next day, we went to a store so I could pick out a wallet and I belt because I needed those things replaced. That was my bday present from her. 
This month is my birthday and last night there was an ice storm that I had to drive through to get home after work. Reading that post combined with those other things have made the feelings I'm having heavier. I just wanted to get it out into the ether or whatever. If anyone does read this, no, we are not together anymore. I'm in therapy and doing okay. ",2,1738886794.0,self,0,1.0,False

The venue has a kitchen with a fridge and large sink but no stove. 
I‚Äôm running into springtime wedding chaos in mid April. 
Caterers are replying, ‚Äúall booked up‚Äù ‚Äúclosed Sundays‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt want BBQ or restaurant drop off food. 

I need the food catered and someone there to tend to the party and food all afternoon. 
I want several options on the buffet and if gluten free can be done, bonus. 
I have a lot of picky eaters so if I have 12-16 different items, they can pick and choose‚Ä¶.
Also, hot tea, coffee, soft drinks and wine. 

When I‚Äôm not actively looking for someone I can think of people that are doing catering and would love the business. 
But, when I need someone, Google shows me all the big companies that don‚Äôt need my business. 

Finding someone that needs/wants my business and is looking for customers would be ideal. Not because of money, I will pay big co. prices to a small co. It‚Äôs because I like to feel appreciated for patronizing a business just as I make the business feel appreciated for whatever service they offer our community. 
I dislike feeling like I‚Äôm putting someone out or just another customer. 
I like to show appreciation both ways and compensate for a job someone‚Äôs heart is in and they like what they are doing.
So far, everyone I have spoken to I have apologized for bothering them or dare asking if they could cater a Sunday affair in April. 

I know there are smaller companies specializing in customizing and organizing around specific needs of the client and that‚Äôs who I am looking for. 

Thank you if you know of the company I am searching and help me.

‚òΩÔ∏é\~\~Personality\~\~‚òæÔ∏é



Cheerful and kind, Naoki acts like a big brother towards everyone without fail. He always seems to be in a good mood and is always looking for something fun to do. When interested, he can spend hours working on something or doing something, but as soon as he gets bored he will look for something else to do. The only exception is when he does something to help someone else, especially if it involves hero work, as he is fully aware that he can‚Äôt afford to slack off just because it gets difficult.

Naoki has a very welcoming and approachable aura. He talks eye to eye with everyone and is capable of adjusting his speech pattern depending on his partner‚Äôs intellect. On the other hand, he makes no difference between higher-ups and equals, which is often considered disrespectful by others.

Naoki is very fond of children and everything children like. Whenever he meets a child, his brotherly demeanor is even stronger than usual, as if his personal goal is to protect that child. When Eri came to UA, he took it upon himself to look out for her, even if Aizawa and Togata insisted it was fine.¬†

‚òΩÔ∏é\~\~Backstory\~\~‚òæÔ∏é

Naoki grew up in an area where there was a lot of gang activity, so his parents taught him how to survive from the moment he could walk, in case the worst happened. His family was poor and couldn‚Äôt afford moving to a safer area. Despite that, his parents did whatever they could to give him and his little sister Aiko a good childhood.

Naoki‚Äôs quirk developed without him noticing until he was seven, which was when he accidentally stole the quirk of a gang member who was trying to mug him. That quirk was regeneration. Naoki just ran away and hid from the guy, thinking that Regeneration was his own quirk finally manifesting and didn‚Äôt realize the true nature of his quirk.

The day Naoki realized the true nature of his quirk was also the day disaster struck. When he turned 10, his parents took him and his little sister birthday shopping at the mall. Naoki and Aiko were fooling around and during that, he took Aiko‚Äôs quirk, Plasma. Aiko, upon noticing, threw a tantrum and Naoki panicked as he was trying to give her quirk back. But before he actually could, a group of villains attacked the mall, causing huge collateral damage. Naoki and his family got buried in the rubble, and Naoki only survived because of his regeneration quirk.

Naoki was saved by Eraserhead after the villains were defeated. His parents had died at the scene, and Aiko died in the hospital. He was never able to return her quirk. With Eraserhead being his saviour and the fact that he didn‚Äôt have anyone left, Naoki clung to him like a lifeline, refusing to let go, let alone letting himself be put into a foster family. He cried endlessly, apologizing to Aiko for stealing her quirk and not being able to protect her. Hearing this, Aizawa decided to adopt him. He realized that if he wasn‚Äôt guided correctly, Naoki could become a dangerous villain, and he couldn‚Äôt prevent that if he was put into any foster home.

  


‚òΩÔ∏é\~\~Trivia\~\~‚òæÔ∏é

* Naoki didn‚Äôt reveal the true nature of his quirk to his class until after All For One first appeared. Upon realizing the similarities between himself and AFO, he became wary of himself and feared that he could‚Äôve become just as awful if Aizawa hadn't taken him in.
* His quirk developed from his father‚Äôs quirk, who had a copy quirk. His quirk is a mutation of that.
* He always wanted to become a famous musician until Aizawa taught him about heroes. It‚Äôs still something he wants to pursue on the side
* He cannot steal mutation quirks.
* He rarely takes anyone‚Äôs quirks, unless it‚Äôs to disarm a villain. For allies, he always asks for consent first. He returns the quirk once he doesn‚Äôt need it anymore
* He made Aizawa go to lots of musicals with him
* The first thing Naoki did when he met Eri was to show her his favourite children music
* While he gets along with everyone in the class, he regularly cusses out Mineta for being a creep
* Naoki and Jiro often jam together
* Naoki's plasma is similar to Aisha's Morphix from Winx Club",1,1738886232.0,MyHeroAcadamia,0,1.0,False

I told him when we get a place together, i want the tracking off and he said he didn‚Äôt know how he felt about turning it off because his parents have anxiety and it makes them ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù to know where he is when he‚Äôs not home (he only graduated a year or so ago and is staying at home until my lease is up so we can get a place together- we basically live together now as much as he‚Äôs over but my place is too small to actually have it be ours - expensive city problems)

1ijhcx7,https://i.redd.it/orhf5mrywlhe1.jpeg,ENCANTO - A GIFT FOR ABUELA üêõüéÅüßÅ,"Translation I found for this book! As it's not easy to access for others. Hope you enjoy. Any thoughts or feelings welcome but please REFRAIN from Alma bashing! 

Story : 

Deep in the Colombian mountains, in the village of Encanto, lives the Madrigal family...a rather special family! Each member has a magical power.

Isabela, for example, makes the flowers bloom. Antonio talks to animals. Dolores has supernatural hearing. Even the house, Casita, is enchanted!

Born of a miracle, this extraordinary abode helps set the table, feels the same emotions as its inhabitants, and responds in its own way when spoken to!

Only Mirabel does not have a gift, but she stands out for her intelligence, her humor and her sensitivity.

This morning, the sun is shining on The Encanto. To take advantage of the good weather, Julieta has decided to serve breakfast outside, on the terrace. Soon, the table is covered with the most delicious dishes! There is ripe fruit, fresh coffee, corn cakes stuffed with cheese, juices of all kinds...Everyone takes their seats with enthusiasm and appetite.

As Julieta sits down, Luisa says:

‚ÄúTomorrow is Abuela's birthday. Has everyone found her a present?‚Äù

Isabela is the first to answer : 

‚ÄúYes! I'm going to surprise her with a long carpet of roses leading to the Casita courtyard!‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm almost done adding embroidery to her new shawl.‚Äù Mirabel says.

She thinks about the candle and butterfly patterns she has been sewing on the stole for several evenings. ‚ÄúI hope Abuela likes them!‚Äù 

Camilo gets up to speak.

‚ÄúT√≠o Bruno, his rats and I are rehearsing a scene from her favorite telenovela.‚Äù he announces.

At the same time, and under the admiring eyes of his family, he transforms into a character from the television series. 

‚ÄúLet's not forget the music.‚Äù Felix interjects. Abuela's favorite vallenato band is already rehearsing. She loves to dance!

Pepa, who has the power to control the weather, concludes:

‚ÄúI'm glad everyone found their gifts.‚Äù

Despite the general excitement, Antonio can't get excited about his Abuela party.

‚ÄúI have to find a gift for Abuela's birthday.‚Äù he whispers to Chispi, his capybara friend. ‚ÄúBut what can you give to someone so special and so loved?‚Äù

The others all have amazing ideas!

He thought for a moment.

‚ÄúWhat if I ask her what she wants?‚Äù He suggests.

Chispi gives him a disapproving look, which means: ""Bad idea, final. It would spoil the surprise!"" 

Later that day. Antonio walks past his grandmother's room. The door is ajar, so he peeks in. Abuela Alma is sitting in her rocking chair. 

In her hands she holds a black and white portrait. The boy recognizes the face in the photo: it is that of Abuelo Pedro, when he was young.


Abuelo died before Antonio was born. Everyone in the family knows how much Alma misses him.

‚ÄúI would like to find an idea to make her happy.‚Äù Antonio whispers to Chispi. ‚ÄúShe looks sad, don't you think?‚Äù

The capybara, as usual, looks skeptical.

But, thanks to his gift of communicating with animals, Antonio knows that behind this incredulous air, his friend agrees. 

So, the next morning, they go to the central square of the village. All the inhabitants are preparing for the festivities!

Because Abuela is not only the head of the Madrigal family, she is also a person loved and respected by everyone at Encanto.

And for good reason! It's thanks to the miracle she witnessed years ago

That the inhabitants are protected from evil.

Accompanied by his animal friends, Antonio searches the surroundings for a gift idea. Suddenly, a monkey jumps on Chispi's head. He points to a piano carried by Luisa - with one hand, of course, thanks to her superhuman strength!

‚ÄúNo way. ‚Äú laughs Antonio. ‚ÄúI'm not going to give her a piano!‚Äù

He had barely finished speaking when two hummingbirds flew in and wrapped his scarf around his head to cover his eyes. 

The boy bursts out laughing and lifts the edge of the scarf to see where he is putting his feet. At that moment, his gaze falls on a stand of bu√±uelos...his favorite snack!

Besides, he is not the only one to love these delicious snacks sold in the streets of Encanto. As proof, the long line that stretches in front of the stall! 

As soon as he smells the scent, Antonio remembers a memory. Some time ago, while he was waiting in front of this same stand with Abuela, she told him the story of her meeting with Abuelo. 

‚ÄúThey shared bu√±uelos!‚Äù  Antonio remembers, his eyes wide. ‚ÄúAbuela told me it was her favorite meal, and that she often made them for Abuelo to celebrate their joy.‚Äù

He snaps his fingers, certain he's found the perfect idea. 

‚ÄúThat's it! I'm not going to buy her a gift... I'm going to make her one!‚Äù 

Without further ado, Antonio heads back home. As he walks, he makes his plan. First, he has to find someone in the family who knows Abuela's recipe. Then he'll set out in the kitchen and will prepare delicious bu√±uelos to bring back happy memories to his grandmother!

Back at Casita, Antonio looks for his mother, Pepa. Without success, Felix, his father, is not there either. They have probably gone shopping for the party. 

At that moment, Antonio hears a noise on the first floor. It's Mirabel! Quickly, he runs up the stairs four at a time and knocks on his cousin's door. 

She opens the door with a smile and listens to him with attention. When he finishes, she shakes her head. She has never made bu√±uelos and has never had the recipe in her hands.

‚ÄúSorry, To√±ito.‚Äù she sighs. ‚ÄúBut I know someone who should know‚Ä¶‚Äù 

She motions for him to follow her, and the two of them walk through the house toward the kitchen. 

Julieta is in the kitchen, and all around her, there's a real commotion! Dishes are spinning, colanders are dancing, freshly cut vegetables are swirling and a pitcher of water is pouring itself into a bowl!

It looks like Casita has decided to give Julieta a hand with the festive meal.

When Mirabel and Antonio question her, she answers them ‚ÄúOf course I know Abuela's recipe! And I'd love to share it with you.‚Äù

She opens a drawer filled with delicately folded papers and pulls one out from under the pile. Antonio and Mirabel are amazed by this treasure.

They watch Julieta as she scans the recipe with her eyes, which appeared from Abuelo Alma and Abuelo Pedro, more than fifty years ago. Then she reads it to the children. Antonio is delighted. It's exactly what he needed. He gives an emotional glance to his cousin and she nods.

‚ÄúAre you ready to prepare delicious bu√±uelos?‚Äù Julieta asks.

Both of them nod vigorously. Then, without wasting a minute, they get to work!

Antonio and Mirabel are so excited. They love to cook, so the idea of preparing their grandmother's favorite dish for her birthday fills them with joy!

First, they take out all the utensils and ingredients they need. Julieta dictates the list to them. They need sheep's cheese, corn and manioc starch, sugar, eggs, butter, milk and salt. And don't forget a good dose of oil for frying, of course!

Mirabel's mother stands between her daughter and her nephew to show them how to do it. She starts by mixing the wet and dry ingredients to make the dough. Her two young apprentices imitate her.

‚ÄúShe's all sticky!‚Äù Antonio notes, laughing.

In fact, he has dough all over his fingers!

His aunt suggests that he add cornstarch. He follows her advice and soon has a big golden ball. After letting the dough rest for ten minutes under a damp cloth, the three cooks form several nicely round balls. Finally, it's time to fry the bu√±uelos! 

‚ÄúBe very careful,‚Äù warned Mirabel's mother. The oil is extremely hot! In fact, in the pan,

Antonio and Mirabel are very attentive.

A delicious smell of donuts fills the kitchen... and other members of the family soon arrive!

Dolores, who heard the crackling from the back of her room, runs first. She is joined by Camilo who arrives with his nose in the air, enticed by the perfume. 

After asking Julieta's permission, Antonio hands out a few donuts to the newcomers. But he warns them right away: he's keeping the rest for a surprise! His siblings accept without protest...even though they would have liked to taste dozens more! Abuela's recipe is definitely exquisite.

When he finished tidying up the kitchen, Antonio hands the basket full of pastries to his aunt and says:

‚ÄúT√≠a Julieta, I know that Abuelo Pedro is missed a lot by  Abuela. Could you add a little magic to these bu√±uelos to make her sadness disappear?‚Äù

Julieta smiles and replies that the boy's love for his grandmother, as well as her thoughtful gift, have as much power as magic

Reassured, Antonio runs to his room to wrap his gift with the help of his animal friends. They add their little touch: orchids, one of Abuela and Abuelo's favorite flowers!

The sun is setting over the Colombian mountains. It's time for Abuela's birthday party! Casita is decked out in her finest. 

Huge garlands of flowersmulti-colored, created by Isabela thanks to her pe–µ–ª—Å–µ, dress the inner courtyard, The grand staircase is decorated with a sumptuous carpet of roses. And what about the members of the Madrigal family? They all got out their best outfit! Even Bruno's rats are dressed to the nines: one of the rats is wearing a dress that fits her...and a little matching headdress!

Throughout the house, lively music mixes with bursts of laughter. The atmosphere is even more joyful than usual! Everyone waits for Abuela to arrive, who finishes getting ready in her room.

When, finally, the old lady appears at the top of the stairs, there is silence. 

Julieta, Felix, Bruno, Dolores and the others watch her descend, with a slow and elegant step. Then, each in turn, they file past her to offer her their gift. 

‚ÄúThese red roses are beautiful, Isabela.‚Äù Abuela said, hugging her.

Then it was Mirabel's turn to step forward.

She hands it to her grandmother the shawl she decorated with embroidery. 

Abuela admires the patterns, then wraps herself in it.

‚ÄúI love my new shawl!‚Äù she exclaims with emotion.

Finally, everyone turns to Antonio. But the boy is not ready to give his gift yet. He wants to wait for the perfect moment!

The Madrigal family sits down at the table, in a joyful hubbub.

Abuela settles into her usual seat and Antonio rushes to be next to her. That's when he hands her her basket wrapped and decorated with orchids.

His grandmother carefully unwraps the wrapping and her eyes fill with tears when she discovers the bu√±uelos, all round and golden. With a smile, she takes a bite. Immediately, wonderful memories of her dear and tender husband come back to mind. 

‚ÄúTo√±ito.‚Äù she sighs.

‚ÄúThese delicious bu√±uelos remind me of my Pedro‚Ä¶But also all the good times that we share, you and I, when we walk around town!‚Äù

It's Antonio's turn to be moved. He smiles wide, then goes to curl up in Abuela's arms. She hugs him tightly against her.

Finally, in a soft, warm voice, she whispers:

‚ÄúThank you for the best birthday.‚Äù

We have decent equity in a SoCal home, so we have money to spend on things and can go very well beyond the $37k of cash that gets immigrants extra points for citizenship.  Despite being prior military myself, I have wanted to leave the US for reasons outside the scope of this post for at least a decade.  I was cybersecurity for a couple decades, then had the good fortune of signing a lease for a bar/music venue a few months before the pandemic began (doh!) and might go back to product engineering or cybersecurity, or might just open a tea shop in Vancouver.

While we want to leave for lots of reasons, those reasons are accelerating.  My wife is funded by NIH grants and has already had a couple techs have their funding frozen, and her own grant processes frozen, due to...you know, that stuff I don't want to get into arguments about.  My son is trans, and still a minor, and we almost wonder if he would be needing asylum at this point given the POTUS has decided to target 0.5% of the population rather aggressively.

1. Our understanding is that Vancouver is pretty socially progressive, and accepting of LGBTQ?  Our our son is a good...quarter? of why we want to leave, and a good half of the urgency, with a goal of being someplace he will be safe and able to get care that is now illegal in the US.
2. We have enough of a property that we actually have goats, despite being in the city.  We'll hate to leave the goats, we love them, but since my wife might be trying to work for the university, we're not sure how reasonable it is to have a place with...goats.  We also have dogs and cats, but...that's not as crazy ;)  San Diego has crappy public transportation.  Yes, we are visiting soon to get a feel for things (after our son gets his passport), but...
3. I hate this question when people ask it about San Diego - but I gotta ask.  We don't really care about the size of our house (3br/2ba? our older kid isn't sure if they would move, they're an adult technically), but otherwise what sort of household income is needed for a non-greedy middle class lifestyle?  We're not lavish, our laptops are more than 3 years old and none of the people in the house have the latest generation of phones :P   I know people in San Diego that make $40k and are happy, I know people who make $500k and are miserable, but if we just want to be able to afford a couple vacations a year and whatever, is that...$150k?  $200k?  My wife will have a much easier time getting a work permit than me, so we want to see what we could live on while I wrap up other stuff and then try to dust off my skills.  A 5 year break from cybersecurity as a middle-aged person is a career ender generally.
4. we have a few northern friends, a couple close friends are in Calgary and said we should stay away due to our son, though there's a position there at the university my wife is very well qualified for.  My wife and I know a tiny bit of French, but...only enough to order coffee from a patient person.  Are we right to be focusing on Vancouver over other areas in the great wilderness known as Canada?

to be honest I personally have advocated for Germany or Spain (my German and Spanish are much better than my French, among other things), but my wife wants to be on the same continent as our extended families.  We both lived in upstate NY for a while so we're not really worried about the cold.

Then it pours out either nothing at all, or maybe too fast? My drink tastes like water, I don't know if it's cause of oat milk, and I didn't steam it right or the beans aren't being grinded and extracted right. 

I also tore the felt washer when cleaning. Could that be an issue? Or is my burr not set right? Or am I grinding the beans at the wrong setting?

If I was you I would NEVER rent this apartment. I lived in this apartment (it did not look as nice) for a little over 5 years. Here are things that sterling management did during the time I lived with them (2019-2024) 

(PSA: people will knock on your windows year round at anytime of night or day. They literally are street level.)

1.) My sink was over 30 years old. It broke monthly because it was NOT maintained and by broke I mean you could turn the knobs and NO water would come out and when it did work it was only the cold water. I did my dishes in my bathtub for over 3 months because they wouldn‚Äôt come in and fix it. 

2.) my neighbor threatened me on multiple occasions. He would beat on the walls, beat on the door aggressively and the cops had to respond multiple times. He threatened my life so they ‚Äúgraciously‚Äù let me move out. They tried to get me to pay the lease break fee than ‚Äúmagically‚Äù after threatening them legally, BENTON COUNTY, who owns the building ‚Äúpaid it‚Äù

3.) When someone moved out they wouldn‚Äôt change the door code until someone complained 

4.) Our mail was constantly stolen because of the fact that they wouldn‚Äôt change the door code. (How do I know this was an issue? Because everytime they changed the code we would have NO mail theft for months) 

5.) While some of the office staff are nice upper management has no loyalty to make sure things are fixed. Infact when you call in to complain that your sink isn‚Äôt working and the maintenance worker says he‚Äôll be back soon (before EOD) and doesn‚Äôt return you get essentially called a ‚ÄúLiar‚Äù but the refuse to accept the emails you‚Äôve sent with proof the sink is still not working. 

6.) One time my water started leaking and it got onto my counter, it ruined my coffee machine, my blender and my toaster. They came in and turned the water off, didn‚Äôt notify me, and when I got home (11hrs later) there was an inch of standing water on my kitchen floor and tons of water on my counters. When I called to inquire why o wasn‚Äôt notified (due to the standing water all over my kitchen) she said they don‚Äôt have to notify me if they enter my unit for an emergency. It‚Äôs in our lease that they do. 

7.) when I moved out, again after living there 5years  tried to charge me $80 dollars over my deposit for ‚Äúpaint supplies‚Äù and refused to provide me (or my lawyer) with any proof they actually purchased new ones. Benton county again ended up ‚Äúpaying for it‚Äù. So imagine my suprise when I get a threatening, text, phone call and email stating I HAVE to pay them in 5 days or they will send me to collections. When I call the person I talk to says ‚Äúya I can see you paid not sure why they called.‚Äù 

And finally, this was not an issue for me but I think they should inform new tenants that a lot of the tenants are in a Benton county Drug rehab program and no they will not actually step in even when your neighbor who is not a part of the program is selling drugs out of his window and to people in the program.

Hello all, I am glad to find community here, though I do wish it was for different reasons. 
I wanted to inquire with everyone if this situation has happened to anyone else and if anyone has any advice (I‚Äôve seen lots of helpful folks comment on others so I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall will come through for me) 
I lived in South Eastern Texas for 22years, throughout childhood I had slight eczema but it was only very small splotchy areas and it went away after a while. Cut to 2022, I moved to New York and have had four years of hell with a flare up that refuses to quit. I have very large areas of my legs that are covered with eczema (think the entire back of my thighs, and inside). Arms are inside all splotchy that is now creeping to the outside too. 
I do not know the cause (part of the frustration), but also not much works to keep it away either. It started on just my thighs, then my lower stomach, now it‚Äôs on my hands and all over my arms. There are days where I can barely bend my legs because the back of my knees are just too inflamed or dry. It makes it hard to exercise as when I sweat it stings. I have seen a derm here and she recommended ‚Äúloose clothing and moisturizing after the shower, no fragrance‚Äù all very common and what I was already doing. 

What I have done: 
I eat whole organic foods, 
never more than 1 cup of coffee a day,
I have a shower filter that removes all the usual crap that is in our tap water,
I use moisturizer daily,
I have tried Opzelura but it is incredibly expensive and does not work on anything but my hands,
I do not wear things with fragrance, 
I drink lots of water,
I wear gloves when dishwashing,
I have practically thrown out my entire wardrobe save for the items that are 100% cotton or other non-toxic materials, 
I have done what I can to manage stress,
And I am 100% sober.

I just feel like I have tried lots to remedy this issue and haven‚Äôt caught a single break. So tell me, has this happened to you? Or do you have any helpful info that could point me towards a silver lining?",1,1738885743.0,eczema,1,0.99,False

1ijh7cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1ijh7cd/hello_i_think_i_need_help/,Hello. I think I need help.,"Hello.

My heart is really heavy tonight as I write.

Six months ago, after more than a decade of daily drinking i decide to end this because I am too poor to afford beer. 

I then develop some ear problems. I hear my loud, boomy baritone voice hit my eardrum hard every time I speak. 

My job required me to talk. I am self employed. I decide to quit, unable to continue anymore. 

I start writing, following the advice from some self help book.

I will always remember this morning where I write :

‚ÄúIf everything was possible , what would I become ? ‚Äú

And I feel the pen gliding on the paper, and witness the words ‚Äúa woman‚Äù appearing before me. 

I realize I have to explore this because frankly my life is finished right now and it‚Äôs only a piece of paper, it‚Äôs not gonna do anything to write. 

I write and I remember episodes of my life. I realize i have been suppressing a lot of who I was.

A freaking lot. 

Page after page, for months all I write is about this. Becoming a woman. I go as far as buying a dress and putting it on and, to my surprise I look incredible in it. I even try it on before my wife, saying I bought it for the fabric as I started learning stuff about sewing. 

I am also terrified. Terrified. On one hand i realize i had dreams, visions of me as a woman and this makes me feel incredible. On the other hand I am so scared. 

I find out people who are trans are actually kind of nice people, also I realize I wouldn‚Äôt mind being a trans woman at all : ladies, you are so inspiring for me. 

But on the other hand I feel shitty and keep repeating to myself it‚Äôs not going to happen, I don‚Äôt want my ‚Ä¶ breadstick ? To go from what I know to something I don‚Äôt exactly know. What if I don‚Äôt like it ? 

I explore some more of my past and repressed feelings. And oh boy. The deeper I dig, the more dysphoria I find, I realize I also am dissociating every single day since puberty and that‚Äôs what led me to drinking : when I am tipsy, I am still dissociating but I can blame it on the booze. 

I realize as a child I loved it when my classmates would call me a girl. 

I realize as a teen I was drawn to trying on my mom‚Äôs clothes. Not my dad‚Äôs. My parents found out and we had a ‚Äútalk‚Äù‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs a blur period of my life, i remember being locked in a closet for hours, being told horrid stuff about people transitioning and bigot stuff and ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fragmented, blurry and may not be exact in any way but I believe I was mentally abused into suppression. 

I remember people I knew as a young adult closely monitoring me for signs of me being trans, cracking transphobic ‚Äújokes‚Äù and me not laughing (I hate transphobia, I hate this so much, always did !!) Finding out later in life these people all knew each other and knew my family turned my blood into ice. 

And, basically I could go on and on and on for hours about this journey of me wanting something, me repressing it and me being conditioned into repressing it. 

I remember the dissociation I felt and still feel . 

It‚Äôs been a hard 6 months. I realize I am just not a man. I admitted to my wife, after she asked if I wanted to ‚Äúbecome a woman‚Äù that I already was one. 

I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything about it or finally admitting that I desperately need to do something and to take a damn decision. 

And then the orange buffoon and his army of 
Buttlickers show up and they just proceed to oppress trans people specifically because some egomaniac decided his daughter wasn‚Äôt a valid person. He reminds me of my dad. More fear for me, though.

I am not asking what should I do. I am here to share this story and to ask you this : 
What would you do ? 

Deep down, I would love exploring being a woman in my late 30s and I dread doing nothing about what I feel. I don‚Äôt care if I am a big, incredible woman who wields a guitar with ease, has a twisted sense of humor, likes coffee and wears black dresses. That doesn‚Äôt sound half bad to me, sure beats doing nothing. I can‚Äôt even see myself regretting this decision.

But the fear keeps me from just smashing this damn egg of mine. If the world was perfect, what would I become ? No limits.
I see the pen gliding on the paper, writing down:
‚ÄúA woman‚Äù

she messaged me everyday, found out I was going to a meeting near where she works and asked to meet me for coffee

We meet, she‚Äôs great but a majority of the chat was about keeping things a bit fun, light, etc

From here she‚Äôs messages me everyday for a week. I ask to meet her again because I thought maybe I could still get her as a client. She turned me down for the coffee invite but a few days later was really happy to go for drinks with me at a bar

I felt guilty because I‚Äôve got a girlfriend so I cancelled the meeting,
told her about my girlfriend and mentioned we shouldn‚Äôt text unless professional 

She apologised and said she was just looking to make connections in the industry (I think this was to save face)

A few days pass and I felt a bit guilty for rejecting her so abruptly. I tried to give her a call as I felt it's a better way to communicate with something like this but she didn't pick up. She did text me though and said she was out with friends for her birthday.

From here I've gone no contact.

I'm interested to gauge what her intentions were?

Although I held back on flirting and kept things platonic I must admit because she was pretty assertive, open and wanted to go for a drink I saw myself getting attracted which is why I chose to walk away",0,1738884788.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

1ijgv7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ijgv7f/the_passenger/,The Passenger,"I‚Äôve always preferred solitude. No office politics, no customers‚Äîjust me, my rig, and the hum of the open road. All I need to do is get from point A to B, and since I‚Äôm paid per mile, I don‚Äôt mind the long cross-state treks. The only downside is that I don‚Äôt see home nearly as often, but when I do, I make sure to spend as much time as I can with my family and friends. Besides that, I love blasting music, eating greasy fast food, and driving through the beautiful scenery America has to offer. But lately, the road hasn‚Äôt felt as peaceful.

I don‚Äôt know when it started. Maybe a few weeks ago. Maybe months. It‚Äôs hard to tell. Some nights, the highway feels different‚Äîlonger, emptier, like I‚Äôm driving through a place that doesn‚Äôt quite exist. I figured it was just exhaustion playing tricks on me. That happens when you push yourself too hard. That‚Äôs why I started setting timers to pull over and nap every few hours. Sleep deprivation turns the brain into an unreliable narrator, and I have no interest in waking up wrapped around a telephone pole.

But even with rest breaks, something about tonight felt off. It started small. I thought my radio was acting up. I was driving through the middle of nowhere when my CB switched off, and I heard faint chatter‚Äîjust a soft murmur beneath the hum of the engine. I reached for the dial, thinking maybe a signal had bled through, but the moment my fingers touched it‚Äîsilence.

It scared the hell out of me, but I knew better than to let my mind wander. Hallucinations happen when you‚Äôre sleep-deprived. That‚Äôs why I stick to my rest schedule, even if it means delaying deliveries. I wasn‚Äôt about to let fatigue get the best of me.

A few minutes later, I heard it again. A whisper of static, a voice crackling through the quiet, just barely loud enough to catch. It was like someone had picked up a transmission on the edge of the range. I listened harder, leaning toward the speaker. The voice wasn‚Äôt speaking English. It wasn‚Äôt speaking any language I knew.

I turned the CB on, scanning through channels. Nothing. Just empty air. That should‚Äôve been the end of it. Just a faulty radio. That‚Äôs what I told myself. But then, the voices came from somewhere else. The passenger seat.

I heard my name. No, I felt my name. Not out loud, not like someone calling from another room, but as if the suggestion of sound had brushed the back of my mind. A whispered thought that wasn‚Äôt my own. A chill crawled up my spine. I gripped the wheel tighter, flicking my eyes toward the empty seat. My duffel bag was buckled in, my thermos resting against it. Nothing out of place. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that someone was sitting there.

My stomach twisted. I knew it wasn‚Äôt real‚ÄîI knew it. But the sensation lingered, like the ghost of a hand brushing against my arm. I blinked hard, forcing my focus back to the road. It‚Äôs just exhaustion, I told myself. Just my mind playing tricks on me. But that‚Äôs what scared me the most.

My dad had been sharp once. A man who could play the piano with his eyes closed, never needing a calendar, always remembering every school event. Then, in his early forties, he started forgetting things. Small things at first‚Äîwhere he left his keys, the name of a town he‚Äôd passed through a hundred times. Then, one day, he forgot how to drive.

Early-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs. Runs in the family.

And now, here I was, hearing things that weren‚Äôt there. I clenched my jaw, gripping the wheel tighter. It‚Äôs just fatigue. I had to believe that. Because the alternative? That was something I wasn‚Äôt ready to face.

After a while, everything seemed to settle. The rain started drumming against the windshield, steady and relentless, blurring the world beyond the wipers. I rubbed my eyes with one hand, keeping the other firm on the wheel. The miles stretched endlessly, an unbroken ribbon of wet pavement cutting through the dark.

Then‚Äîclick.

I flinched. The sound was unmistakable. The passenger seatbelt had just fastened itself. My heart lurched into my throat. My gaze snapped to the belt, now pulled taut against the empty seat. I swallowed thickly. The truck hit a bump, jolting slightly, and the belt‚Ä¶ tightened. Like something was sitting there. For a long, terrible moment, I just stared at it. The belt remained locked, stiff, and secure‚Äîas if someone invisible had just settled in for the ride. A deep, gnawing chill crept down my spine. I was alone, but something was buckled in.

I reached over, hesitated for half a second, then unbuckled it. The belt snapped back into place with a sharp whip. I exhaled slowly, shaking my head. Probably just a sensor issue. Just exhaustion. Just my imagination. I tried to believe that. For a moment, everything was fine. Just keep driving.

I glanced at the clock on the dash. 1:43 AM. Still a couple of hours from the nearest rest stop. I sighed and reached for my coffee, but it had long gone cold. As I maneuvered around potholes, something glistened ahead‚Äîroadkill, maybe. At least, I thought it was roadkill. I slowed my truck as I got closer, narrowing my eyes against the rain. It was a deer, lying on its back just off the road, its legs stiff and pointing toward the sky. The downpour made it hard to see, but something about it looked especially‚Ä¶ wrong.¬†

Its neck was mangled, strands of muscle and sinew exposed where the head should have been. I assumed it had been torn off in a collision, but as I kept looking, my stomach twisted. The chest and abdomen had been carved open, hollowed of all its organs. It was disgusting, to say the least, but I chalked it up to a deer falling prey to a bear. Yet as I studied the scene, I realized this wasn‚Äôt the work of a wild animal.

The body was too clean. No gore. No scattered organs. Just a hollowed-out shell, its ribcage exposed, its insides missing like they‚Äôd been scooped out with surgical precision. The hide along its back was peeled open, a long, deliberate slit running down its spine. The edges of the wound weren‚Äôt fresh‚Äîthey had been seared shut. And inside?

Nothing. Just an empty, black void where life used to be.

I pressed the gas, eager to put distance between me and the carcass. But just as I glanced in my mirror‚ÄîMy stomach dropped. Something was stepping into the deer‚Äôs hollowed chest.

¬†It looked almost human-shaped, but the neck was too long, the shoulders too broad. My heart stalled as I watched it slowly descend into the cavity.¬†

Then the deer jerked. Not like a dying animal. Not like something taking its last breath. Like something inside was testing the controls. Its front legs slammed onto the pavement, stiff and awkward, as if they had locked into place. The back legs twitched, then kicked out all at once, sending the body into a brief, unnatural spasm. Then, in one violent motion, it stood.

I slammed my foot against the gas pedal, barreling down the road. Whatever I had just seen was fucking horrifying, and I wasn‚Äôt about to stick around to see what it would do next. After a few minutes of reckless speed, I forced myself to calm down and drive safely. I tried to rationalize what I had just experienced. It had to be a hallucination, a trick of exhaustion and paranoia. The darkness, the rain, my overworked brain‚Äîit all made sense. I was just going a little crazy from lack of sleep.

Then I heard the clacking.

It was impossibly loud. Clack, clack, clack. The sharp rhythm of hooves striking the pavement sent a surge of cold terror through my veins. Tears welled in my eyes as I dared to look to the side. Beside my truck, moving impossibly fast, was the same headless deer. Its body contorted with rage, its bones pushing through the skin as it ran. From the hollowed chest, long black hair flowed wildly in the wind.

I slammed my foot onto the gas again, praying I could get away. Fifty miles per hour. Sixty. Seventy. I pushed past eighty, but it didn‚Äôt matter. The deer matched my speed effortlessly. Almost tauntingly, it kept the same distance beside my truck, screeching with every step. Then, it closed the gap.

I barely had time to react before two gaunt, skeletal arms emerged from the deer‚Äôs chest. Each finger ended in a curved, claw-like nail. The creature reached out, slamming its talons into my truck door, piercing through the metal like wet paper.

My stomach turned as it clung to the side of the truck and pulled itself further out of the deer‚Äôs chest, its upper body clawing free. Not just pulling‚Äîtearing. The deer‚Äôs ribcage snapped like brittle wood, splitting apart as the thing inside forced itself loose. Strands of flesh and sinew stretched between them, clinging, resisting‚Äîlike the body didn‚Äôt want to let it go. The deer collapsed onto the road behind me, swallowed by darkness.

I had no clue what to do. My instincts took over, and I started swerving left and right, trying to shake it off. But it held on. Climbing and clawing its way to the roof of my truck. Then, slowly, it lowered itself over the windshield. That‚Äôs when I saw its face. And it was fucking disgusting.

Its skin was deathly pale, stretched tight over sunken cheeks. Its hollow, dead eyes bore into me, every muscle in its face twisted with unrelenting hatred.

The moment our eyes met, it screamed.

The sound wasn‚Äôt just loud‚Äîit was unbearable.

My skull felt like it was splitting open. My eardrums popped, a sharp burst of pain exploding inside my head. Blood dripped from my nose. My vision swam, the world tilting sideways.

Then, it started slamming its head against the windshield.

Over.

And over.

And over.

Each impact sent web-like cracks through the glass, larger and larger, until‚Äî

SMASH.

The thing punched through the windshield and its claws wrapped around my throat. I couldn‚Äôt breathe and my vision darkened as my grip on the steering wheel weakened. I tried slamming on the brakes, hoping the sudden stop would send it flying, but it held on with monstrous strength.

My hands fell from the wheel.

Without my guidance, the truck veered off the road.

And then‚Ä¶

Nothing.

When I started to come to I tasted blood pooling in my mouth. A sharp, crushing pain bloomed in my chest as my senses slowly returned. Smoke clung to the air, thick and acrid, burning my throat with every shallow breath. My head throbbed, and when I tried to move, a bolt of pain shot through my ribs.

I forced my eyes open.

My truck was wrecked, and the front end crumpled around a massive tree. Steam and smoke curled from the destroyed hood, the windshield shattered into jagged pieces. A deep gash throbbed along my forehead, and my hands trembled as I tried to push myself up. I looked down at my torso, lodged deep inside was a large metal fragment when blood slowly drained from the wound. It was when I looked up that I saw it.

Pinned between the hood of my truck and the tree was a long, gangly leg. The skin was sickly pale, stretched taut over knotted tendons. The limb twitched, but the rest of the creature was nowhere to be seen.

I sucked in a ragged breath, my entire body screaming in pain as I searched for my phone. My fingers were slick with blood as I fumbled beneath my seat, finally brushing against the shattered screen. It was barely functional. With crimson dripping from my hands, I wiped the screen clean enough to see the numbers.

9-1-1.

I hit the call button, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The dial tone droned in my ear, dull and distant beneath the haze of adrenaline and exhaustion. My vision swam, my pulse pounding like a war drum against my skull. Then, after what felt like an eternity‚Äî‚Äú911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù

Relief crashed over me, so sudden and overwhelming that it almost drowned out the searing pain from the gashes across my body. My words tumbled out, frantic and uneven. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI was attacked. Some kind of animal‚Äîmy truck got run off the road, and I crashed straight into a tree. I need medical help now! Bring guns‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs still close.‚Äù

I forced myself to keep it vague. The last thing I needed was to sound insane and have them hang up on me. ‚ÄúSir, are you injured?‚Äù The voice was steady and practiced, but I could hear a hint of urgency.¬†

‚ÄúYes‚Äîyeah, I think so. I‚ÄîI‚Äôm bleeding. My head, my chest‚Äî‚Äù I swallowed hard, the pain finally catching up to me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how bad but I have a piece of metal lodged in my stomach‚Äì I can barely move.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, stay with me. Can you tell me your location?‚Äù

I sucked in a shaky breath, forcing myself to look around. The highway was a blur of rain and darkness, my truck‚Äôs headlights barely cutting through the mist.

‚ÄúI‚Äîuh, I was heading south on Route 19. Maybe twenty miles past the last rest stop. I don‚Äôt know exactly where.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôll track your phone‚Äôs GPS.‚Äù A few keystrokes clicked through the line. ‚ÄúHelp is on the way. Stay on the line with me, okay?‚Äù

I nodded before realizing they couldn‚Äôt see me. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

A few seconds passed. Then‚Äî ‚ÄúSir, you mentioned an animal. Can you describe it?‚Äù

I hesitated. My throat tightened. Do I tell them?

I gripped the phone tighter, pulse hammering. ‚ÄúIt‚ÄîIt wasn‚Äôt normal. It looked like a deer, but it was... wrong. It didn‚Äôt have a head, and there was‚Äî‚Äù I stopped myself. The truth sounded insane even in my own ears.

‚ÄúIt ran my truck off the road,‚Äù I said instead. ‚ÄúIt might still be out there.‚Äù

There was another pause, just a little too long. Then the operator‚Äôs voice returned, softer this time.

‚ÄúUnderstood. Just stay put, sir. Emergency services are en route.‚Äù

But in the silence that followed, something else filled the space. A sound, high pitched and angry. A loud screech permeated the forest that my truck was now stuck in. It was so loud the operator on the other side of the line could hear it too.¬†

‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù

I could barely process the question. My breath hitched as I clutched the phone tighter, my fingers slick with sweat and blood.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù My voice caught in my throat. My body refused to move, every instinct screaming at me to stay still. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here.‚Äù

The line went quiet, but I could hear the tension in the operator‚Äôs breathing.

‚ÄúSir, do you have a weapon?‚Äù

I swallowed hard, glancing around the wreckage of my cab. My pocket knife‚Äîtoo small to do anything useful‚Äîwas in the glove compartment, but my hands were shaking so badly I wasn‚Äôt sure I could even hold it. My truck was dead, my body was battered, and I was stranded alone in the dark with that thing. Then I heard more noise. The underbrush rustled. Twigs snapped. The shadows shifted between the trees.

My pulse jackhammered against my ribs. I struggled to move, pushing against the crushed door, but my body screamed in protest. Too slow. Too weak.

From the darkness slowly limped forward A shape. Tall. Gaunt. Watching. Just beyond the reach of my truck‚Äôs flickering headlights, something stood at the treeline. Its frame was impossibly thin, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. The skin was a sickly, corpse-like gray, stretched too tight over sharp bones.

But it was the eyes that made my stomach drop. Two hollow, cavernous pits, black as the void, staring straight at me. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. The operator‚Äôs voice crackled through the line, barely a whisper over the static.

‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶? Are you still there?‚Äù

Her words acted like a trigger for the beast. It got down on its hands and started racing its way towards the truck screeching at the same time. I screamed in terror as I used every ounce of strength to reach for my glovebox. I forced it open and with shaky hands, I managed to grab and flip open the knife. It wasn‚Äôt much but it was all I had.¬†

Looking back at the creature all I saw was a blur of sickly gray limbs, its body contorting unnaturally as it closed the distance in a fraction of a second.¬†

SLAM

The truck shuddered violently as the creature slammed its body against the side, metal groaning under the impact. A long, skeletal arm lunged through the shattered window, clawed fingers grasping blindly for me.

Adrenaline flooded my veins. With a raw, desperate burst of strength, I lunged, gripping my knife tight, and drove the blade deep into its gangly arm.

A piercing shriek tore from its throat, a sound so unnatural it made my skull feel like it was splitting. But it didn‚Äôt stop. It clawed at me, and I fought back, both of us thrashing and tearing at each other like wild animals.

Eventually, the beast had enough and it pulled its arm back through the car window and started to sprint away back into the night. Tears lined my cheeks as I started to fade back into unconsciousness. The last thing I heard was some unintelligible words from the operator.

¬†I woke to blinding light. A harsh, sterile glow burned through my eyelids, pulling me from the depths of unconsciousness. The sharp tang of antiseptic filled my nostrils, mixing with the steady beep‚Ä¶ beep‚Ä¶ beep of machines.

I was alive.

Dazed, I turned my head, my gaze adjusting to the unfamiliar white walls of a hospital room. Tubes ran from my arms, and an IV drip hung beside me. I could barely think past the fog in my skull. Then, I tried to move. A sharp, stabbing ache bloomed in my ribs, but something felt off. I couldn‚Äôt feel anything below my chest. My breath hitched. I swallowed hard, my fingers gripping the thin hospital blanket, but I didn‚Äôt have the heart to look. Instead, I stared at the ceiling, my mind numb, my body wrecked.

But despite the pain‚Äîdespite the fear creeping up my throat‚ÄîI was grateful to be alive.

Days passed in a blur of medication, whispered conversations, and restless sleep. Doctors came and went, their voices distant as they discussed my injuries. A shattered ribcage, deep lacerations, nerve damage.

The prognosis wasn‚Äôt great, but I was lucky to be alive.

My truck was totaled. Emergency responders had found me unconscious, bleeding out in the wreckage. The official report called it a wild animal attack. They assumed a bear or some rabid predator had forced me off the road. I asked about the severed leg that had been stuck between the truck and the tree but I was told nothing of that sort was found so I didn‚Äôt argue.

What else could I say? That I‚Äôd been hunted by something inhuman? That I‚Äôd watched it crawl out of a headless deer‚Äôs chest and tear through my truck like paper? They‚Äôd think I was insane. So I kept my mouth shut.

Even as I lay there, recovering, the memories didn‚Äôt fade. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it. That sickly gray skin, those hollow black eyes, the screech that made my skull rattle. My dreams were filled with flickering headlights and the endless clack of hooves on wet pavement.¬†

A little over a month later I was discharged. The doctors said my mobility would take time to return, but I was already regaining some feeling in my lower body. The nerve damage hadn‚Äôt been as bad as they feared. With therapy, I‚Äôd walk again. That was the first bit of good news I‚Äôd had in a long time.¬†

My best friend, David, picked me up from the hospital. He helped me into the passenger seat of his truck, eyeing my injuries with a grimace. ‚ÄúJesus, man,‚Äù he muttered, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou really got torn up. They said a bear did this?‚Äù

I hesitated. My mouth felt dry. ‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

David didn‚Äôt push. He just nodded, put the truck in gear, and drove. The ride home was quiet. The rain drizzled against the windshield, the wipers dragging across the glass in slow, rhythmic swipes. For the first time in a long time, I felt safe.

The place was exactly how I left it‚Äîsmall, tucked away on the edge of town, surrounded by miles of thick forest. The kind of place where neighbors were a ten-minute drive away and the nights were silent besides the infrequent sound of the wildlife. David helped me inside, made sure I had everything I needed, then left me to rest. I collapsed onto my bed, my body screaming for relief.

I tried to fall asleep, but I couldn‚Äôt. I thought it was just my paranoia. My nerves were still shot, and my brain was still wired from everything that had happened.

Then I heard it. A sound, faint and carrying through the trees. It was a high-pitched shrill screech.

Every muscle in my body went rigid. A sharp pulse of fear crashed through me, but this time, I wasn‚Äôt trapped in a wrecked truck.

This time, I was ready. I reached beside my bed, fingers wrapping around the cold steel of my shotgun.

If that thing had followed me here It wouldn‚Äôt leave alive.

- Wasting so much time at work to go have a ciggy break and I usually will end up having even two in a row.

- Opening the window even when it‚Äôs freezing cold. 
- Going outside in the freezing cold when I am at a restaurant or a bar. Also, I am usually the only one going out to smoke while my friends continue their discussion. 
-The awful smell. 
-The worry of not having enough cigarettes and wasting time going to the tobacco shop. 
- Having less pocket space because of the cigarette pack and lighter. 
- Being out of breath after a flight of stairs. 
- Sometimes skipping gym because of the stamina hit after a cigarette.

All of American law, what's actually law? It's contract law.

That's why they make a big deal out of contract law in The Paper Chase and why that professor is named

Kings-field.

Think ancient chess too.

So for now, I'm naming knowledge that's related and correlated to work they've done in labs as if I wait, have a theory or know an answer to an unanswered question in science as everything that they have has never, ever been proven at Oxford in science court then...

They do the work for me.

They repeatedly demonstrate what I already own as knowledge or they end up testing ideas that I have.

I never needed the money to do the hardcore research.

As I'm not theorizing.

I can know when I just look at their work if it's correct, if it's how nature is and behaves.

It's easy if you're a woman as they deny everything woman, they say to your face that they don't and that's their public line on repeat but in actuality? They never ever actually consider it or reason it so a giant sized hole is, you simply had to be a determined woman.

I can skate right on in and past them. That's how denial works too. 

If they set eyes up me, including judges? They cannot deny me or my fact or what law and US Code actually says.

You need to sue the employees of SCOTUS to figure this out including the Justices when now all of you lived thru clerks stealing a Justice's draft.

Of an opinion.

So ask self: how long have they the clerks been paid to corrupt the law and the process until justice is made impossible unless you buy it or become what they are? Maybe they were always doing that, since 1803.

Science is correct when they claim that theyised something and so many are returning to Octrees and going over that. Again. Yes, do that. They always miss the amount of energy as power becoming motion. 

Unite AI steps with calculus.

You do need these tiny numbers.

And they can be a 1 or be exacting, be motion, they can be fresnel coefficients too.

If the number is absolute and whole?

This number, the number that everyone in physics is taking about since CERN and Higgs failed, they did not get the result that they predicted. Boom, Higgs Theory is bad.

One glaring wrong not error or mistake ?

TWO 'god' particles are, one is male and the other is female.

Observe, all things are born as 2 not 1. 

And all has a biological origin as it's all conscious to some degree but it's not all as consciously aware. 

Right now my 'help' is one other woman and we still need to talk.

So I'M still deciding how I want to do this.

My former plan to serve Congress was derailed but now I know exactly why. I need to reconsider that. When and what I'll serve upon them. 


Bitcoin and the lawsuit for equality as that's about human potential to we each develop or not and how much or not and  in which direction began when I broke into RPIs computer center in 78 or 79 at age 12 and saw Donald Meagher's work up and running.

Before it was released.

I don't think he had publish yet, I believe he did that in 1980. What I saw anyway.

And I saw a 3d truly realistic sphere, cone and cube against a natural scene, something like sand and trees.
 
In color.

So close to reproducing nature but what I knew? Knew? 

ARCHIMEDES.

Hint: They didn't translate Archimedes' palimpsest on Bouyance correctly, they've entirely misinterpreted what he was stating, he knew what's happening in nature.

Sooo

Don't assume, don't make loosey goosey connections.

And?

‚ö†Ô∏è Language!l tricks! 

Choose a dictionary. Whoever you work with or even if you're by yourself?

Always!! Look up the formal definitions of words and in various fields of study, use that to negate your and everyone's subconscious or any mental disorders like denial.

Lawyers and scientists share something in common here: they refuse to let you pin them down on anything especially THEIR exact words as then, you CAN call them.on it and challenge their work. That's why lawyers before me refused to quote the exact words of the founding, governing documents that are contracts, as then they couldn't make this crap up and inflict somebody else's wants or their warped mind on you.

Then? Justice couldn't be for sale.

Currently science is for sale. 

I can backup my work and what I'm saying with tons of evidence and proof and nature that anyone can observe.

 I can give you the details and the absolutes and hardcore GOOD math and science.

Is Reddit appropriate?

Will SV Bros just keep stealing only to destroy the work to then harm you?

Elon Musk is for Elon Musk never for you and he could buy his ideas until I came along but why ppl worship ANY other human will forever be lost upon me. But actually  worshipping the rich on paper only or celebrities esp modern politicians? Paying them tribute, it's not just taxation? You pay them tribute now! 

Maybe they don't have a business plan as they lack the human ability and capacity to create one.

That?? Maybe their idea is fatally flawed from its conception. Maybe it's them, that person.

It's insane.   

I cannot participate in what I know to be criminal or: insane. 

ü§∑

Does make me wanna drink!

And really, are they ever going to help you level the field so that money doesn't give them the wholly unjust advantage anymore? No. Of course not. They can't have you profit share in Bitcoin and all crypto. If crypto still exists at all. 

I never gave them my consent to do anything that they've done, they even REcentralized it to profit and be one members of the Federal Reserve then bitched about INVITING DC REGULATORS back in.

It's fraud, it's Organized Crime In The Open that they brag about.

""Disrupt"" is code, to them?? That word means: violate law, statute and code to profit. 

I'll never ever understand how ppl came to think, how they came to LOVE being slaves and love these INADVERTANT FORMS that slavery takes.

You deny it's slavery as that's not human nature.

You cannot reason what you're acting to do to yourself once you label this crap what it is

A form that slavery takes!

That is weaponized money.

That is unconstitutional forms of money.

Constitutional? Natural?

They CAN'T enslave you unless you're willing to be enslaved and then you LET them enslave you.

Hello My name is‚Ä¶ I am 23 years old, I am 1.68 cm tall and weigh 68 kg. Like every new year full of resolutions, I decided that this was going to be mine too. 
I started in January exercising at home because I am very embarrassed to do it in front of other people, I changed my diet completely, I watched 100 videos on healthy weight loss, I tried it for the first 3 weeks until I felt that I looked the same which makes sense for the short time but you know the desperation, in my search for how to lose weight I found the famous Acxion pills better known as or phentermine, they are not weight loss pills but appetite suppressants, that is, they take away your hunger, I started I started self-medicating, but the side effects were too many, 3am type insomnia, I was also short-tempered and constipated, meaning I couldn't go to the bathroom for days, I stopped taking the pill for a few days but the hunger was brutal, I was consuming approximately 1800 calories a day, which to what I was used to was very little. 


I got frustrated and started taking them again, but I regulated the dose, I no longer felt bad but on the contrary I had a lot of energy and I could go without eating maybe all day but I knew I shouldn't do it, I ate too healthy in January, I started to tone my body a little but it's not enough for me, I want to lose weight and reach 50kg. It doesn't matter how.

February begins, I'm still frustrated with losing weight, I feel stagnant and I don't know what to do, I start taking the pill and stop eating almost all day, I drink a lot of water and wake up deflated which in my eyes looks good, but at what cost? I have been sleeping at 3am for 2 weeks, I feel very sad and want to cry all day, I have no motivation to exercise, I just resign myself to the fact that by eating very little during the day that way I will lose weight...

I have fallen into binge eating again, yesterday I ordered 2 coffees at home, I ordered them in the healthiest way but I did not eat all day and the mixture of caffeine with the effect of the pill made my early morning one of the long ones... 

Today I didn't take the pill, I want to get some sleep, I had watermelon and a kiwi and 1 liter of water for breakfast, for lunch I ordered a taco bell delivery, I ate possibly what 2 people would eat, I tried to vomit it but it didn't work, so I went to take fiber to relax everything... the feeling of guilt invades my entire body and the desire to cry takes over me once again.

So, I've been using my Casabrew espresso machine for about six months now, and it's been a decent starter machine for me.

I'm not trying to hate on the Casabrew ‚Äì I knew it was a budget-friendly option when I bought it. But I'm ready to upgrade!  I'm looking to spend around $500 max.  I definitely can't swing a $1000+ machine.

I've been looking at Gaggia machines. Are they a good step up from the Casabrew?  Would you consider them mid-tier?  And, most importantly, do they make hot espresso?  I know about the Breville Bambino Plus, but I'm curious about other options.

Preference:
¬∞Semi automatic machine.
¬∞I drink americano, latte, or cappuccino.
¬∞Use machine 4-5 days a week.
¬∞Counter space not an issue. 
¬∞Skill level is an advanced beginner üòÅ
¬∞Location-Atlanta, GA, USA.

Any recommendations or advice from you espresso experts would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

#The PSE lost 39 points to 6242 ‚ñº0.6%

Shout-out to /u/SituationLimp2643 for the inflation take appreciation and for the observation that ""inflation feels like a tax on top of the actual tax that the government is charging"" (inflation is programmed wealth transfer from wage earners to asset owners, so there's a reason why it feels that way), to /u/Constant_Mall_3043 for sharing their PSEi newbie experience and for noting that there is a ""certain peace of mind that comes with knowing that you'll get dividends"" (I've come to appreciate this peace much more in my 40s), and to /u/chemhumidifier for the positive feedback on my little inflation rant.

This was a tough week for me from a time-management perspective, but next week we'll have a lot of great stuff to do on the personal finance front, a lot of giveaways, and even an Inside the Boardroom episode if everything goes according to plan! Lots of stuff going on. 

Happy weekend. See you all on Monday!

#‚ñåMain stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  Figaro confirms investor hunt, no knowledge of MONDE exit...** **Figaro Coffee** [FCG 0.83 ‚ñ≤1.2%; 117% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=0a670d6e75e99593ec6e1601ccee8f59)], the **Jerry Liu**-owned and **Justin Liu**-led restaurant company, confirmed a report that FCG has selected an investment bank to assist with finding potential investors, saying that its desire to find new investors was previously disclosed. The report also claimed that **Monde Nissin** [MONDE 7.77 ‚ñº0.1%; 90% avgVol] was seeking to sell its 15% stake in FCG that it purchased in 2023 for ‚Ç±820.3 million. FCG said that it ‚Äúhas no information nor knowledge on this matter‚Äù, and further said that it is ‚Äúnot in a position to confirm nor clarify the plans of MONDE regarding its investment in [FCG].‚Äù The value of MONDE‚Äôs stake has fallen nearly 20% in the two years since it was purchased.
>    - ***MB:*** While MONDE didn‚Äôt confirm its intent to sell in the report, MONDE did say at its last analyst briefing that it was trying to ‚Äúlook for an exit‚Äù because its attempts to bring the FCG brand into the consumer segment had ‚Äúnot been successful.‚Äù FCG‚Äôs price is actually lower now than it was during the time of that briefing, so I can‚Äôt imagine MONDE has sweetened on its position in FCG. All I know is that FCG might find it difficult to raise money through a stake sale if MONDE is also working the phones trying to pitch a similar sale. It doesn‚Äôt sound like the two companies are working together, so I suspect that any buyer would likely receive a better price due to the excess of shares out there on offer between the float, FCG, and MONDE.

>- **[UPDATE]  Colliers PH: Metro Manila has 8.2 years of condo oversupply...** According to a report by **InsiderPH** [[link](https://insiderph.com/colliers-ph-metro-manila-condo-glut-hits-82-years-ofws-seen-as-market-lifeline)] on a briefing by **Colliers PH** research director **Joey Bondoc**, Colliers PH said that it will take 8.2 years to clear the inventory of unsold condo units (approximately 74k units) at the current sales pace. Mr. Bondoc said that the number of unsold units is 77% higher than 2023, with the large increase due to the POGO ban and the associated drain on demand for Metro Manila condos for workers in that industry. Mr. Bondoc said that the struggle to sell units was not universal across all segments of the condo market. High-end condos have been ‚Äúdoing relatively well‚Äù and only account for 5% of the unsold inventory in Metro Manila.
>    - ***MB:*** My take on the condo backlog is simple. People don‚Äôt want to pay ‚Äúbooming condo market‚Äù prices for ‚Äúimploding condo market‚Äù units. While it might be true that developers paid more for the properties on top of which the condos were constructed, the price that one paid for something in the past doesn‚Äôt have any bearing on the current market price of that thing now. Sales are not happening because the actual market price of the condos is a lot lower than the developers want. That‚Äôs it. If they dropped prices dramatically, we‚Äôd see a huge uptick in the number of condos sold. People want to move into the city. They want to buy condos. They just don‚Äôt want to pay some artificially-high price set in 2018 with pre-inflation crisis maintenance fees. It‚Äôs like the time I bought $TRUMP coin for $25.50. I sold most of it for $35.00, but I held on to six coins ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. Well, $TRUMP never mooned. It‚Äôs sitting at $17.50/coin today, and if I tried to sell it for $25.50 ‚Äúbecause that‚Äôs what I paid for it‚Äù when I bought it, the entire world is going to laugh in my face. Not only because I bought $TRUMP, but because buyers don‚Äôt care about your personal story. Markets are free of personal narratives, and the same goes for developers. If they want to take in some cash, they could lower prices and move units. Would it harm their profit projections? Yes, of course, but that‚Äôs life. Price is the reason the condo market is dead.

>- **[DIVS]  RCR declares final FY24 dividend...** **RL Commercial REIT** [RCR 6.04 ‚ñº0.2%; 203% avgVol] a Q4/24 dividend of ‚Ç±0.101/share [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=cdffaad85e42aa5cec6e1601ccee8f59)], payable on February 28 to shareholders of record as of February 20. The dividend has an annualized yield of 6.69% based on the previous closing price, which is essentially flat with RCR‚Äôs pre-dividend annualized yield. The total amount of the dividend is ‚Ç±1587 million, which is 93% of the ‚Ç±1700 million in distributable income that RCR reported for the quarter. Relative to RCR's IPO price, the dividend increased RCR's total stock and dividend return to 14.73%, up from its pre-dividend total return of 13.17%.
>    - ***MB:*** Ignoring the special dividend that RCR declared as a result of the huge ‚Ç±34 billion infusion of mostly mall assets, I‚Äôve seen a few posts talking about the disappointing size of this Q4 dividend. Check **@mokongboy‚Äôs** great chart of RCR‚Äôs dividends to see why. The Q3 dividend was ‚Ç±0.1009/share, then all the assets got infused, and then the Q4 dividend was ‚Ç±0.1010/share. Sure, that‚Äôs an increase, but that‚Äôs only an 0.01% increase. That‚Äôs underwhelming. RCR‚Äôs stock price has increased 20% since the announcement of the infusion back in June of 2024, and while I can‚Äôt prove the increase is tied to the injection and the belief that future quarterly dividends would grow, I know from talking to a lot of REIT investors every day that this was a big part of what caused the buyers spoke with to move into RCR. Don‚Äôt get me twisted, it‚Äôs a good move for RCR to diversify its asset base away from commercial real estate and it‚Äôs not a massive ‚ÄúL‚Äù for it to maintain a stable dividend, but the PR around the injection and the expectations that grew following the special dividend were definitely hinting at bigger and better things. Maybe that‚Äôs still coming? I don‚Äôt know. RCR seems pretty proud of its ability to increase dividends by ‚Ç±0.001 per quarter, but I think investors were looking for better to keep its streak of quarterly dividend increases alive.
