**Delina, PDM** \-- Smelled her before and know I like her. Want to REALLY know she's worth it before buying  because of the price

**Peau De Peche, Keiko Mecheri** \-- I've been looking for a fresh, photorealistic peach and this has been recommended. It's also very reasonably priced! Happy to hear other (realistic, not overly sweet) peach recommendations.

**Ristretto Intense Cafe, Montale** \-- I've been looking for an intense, espresso coffee scent that's not caramel-y or a sweet latte scent. I've tried Akro Awake and Coffee Addict, both of those are way too sweet and not coffee-heavy enough for me. I have Intense Cafe and like it, but it's definitely more of a rose scent than coffee.

Context: So I have this mom circle of friends, 4 kami, the other one is engaged but no kids yet. And  3 of us are all moms (1 year gap for our kids).  I am a first-time mom and I have this mom friendship where I think fell apart. we were friends for 1-2 years. And eventually nagka sunod2 nabuntis, married so parang we have 1 year gap in between. 4 kami magkaibigan, and now, idk what went down the drain. We suddenly dont talk to each other. And I also feel na parang we felt the same way (muted each other, dont want to interact both social media and personal), and there's like an ongoing beef which we cannot explain. We were somehow close and happy and thriving for the past year: visiting each others house, coffee dates, ukay dates, resto hopping. Even though we are all busy at some point, we were never busy for each other. Until this year parang ang cold na. Am I just OA? Are we going through different phases in our post partum journey? Or sadyang may secret animosity talaga?  
  
Friend#1 - we had beef 2 yrs ago, somehow nagkausap but i find it hard to reconnect since ang toxic nya both personal and social media. mahiling mang chismis ng kapwa, naging malaki na rin ang ulo when she started earning more. typical daming kaaway sa social media. but on the good side, she is extra frendly and she reaches out to 3 of us. parang naging glue din sya kasi sya ung nag proactively invite lahat. Introvert kami tatlo. Sya din ung wala pang kid yet engaged. after we talk to fix things last year, ako ang nahihirapan mag reconnect. Like parang may lamat na. We tried to hang out together pero makikita talaga sa face ko na hindi ko kayang mag pretend.  
  
Friend#2. Mas close sila ni #1. bigla nalang hindi nako pinansin. Pansin ko din muted na ako kasi i dont see her liking and watching my day. TBH wala akong kasalanan sa kanya, we never had beef at all. I dont have problems with her but sya ung tipong she will side with whoever she knows the longest and duda ko she only heard of #1's side and of course di ko alam what story she put in. 1 year postpartum.

Friend #3. Mas connected ako sa kanya but she has high boundaries. Sya din ung mejo mentally stable and strong mindset sa aming lahat. She ocassionaly has problems and talks to me. She sometimes has problems with other 2 but she can still face them smiling and can be civil/casual with them after. But idk lately she and Friend #2 hang out together ofter. Mejo less na ang intereaction nya samin lahat. Siguro na totoxican sya. Kasi panay vent out ko sa kanya and she just gave birth.



Previous Attempts: Also, common denominator, lahat kami panganay, so the typical panganay na mejo mataas pride. Walang nag iinitiate for us to talk. Ako nasa post partum journey din ako and getting depressed lot of times, si #2 probably post partum din 1year, si #3 post partum din ata. Ako dedma din pero nasasaktan ako. Masakit pa pala to sa romantic breakup. In a diff perspective, ayoko na din maging close kami ulit knowing what happened and what it caused me. Dami ko nang gasto sa solo travel, I make sure to go out every week to unwind pero whenever I go home, sakit nanaman and it stings a lot. Hinighlight ko talaga ung post partum kasi BAKA (silver lining of hope) na we are all undergoing post partum so baka factor din un.

I never believed in the idea of soulmates or ‚Äúthe one‚Äù, she completely changed my perception.

There's this guy I have been talking for a couple of months ever since he became apart of my friend group. We've been a little flirty, sure, but I get a little flirty with everyone.

I was on call with him last night because neither of us could sleep. The call was normal at first. He talked to me about this game he's been obsessed with, I talked to him about a new coffee shop some of our friends have been talking about going to, etc just normal friendly discussion.

Then he started sounding more like, breathy? Idk the best word to describe it, but he began whispering a lot more and almost sounded like he was panting, but also like he was trying to sound normal. My mind at first goes to him being injured, so I asked if he's okay. He said he's okay, and he went back to being overall normal. At this point, I was just confused and concerned but we continued talking.

A couple minutes later, the same stuff happened as the first time with him whispering and panting. I asked him again and he then said he couldn't help himself. I was still confused, but I was kind of catching on, but apart of me thought I was being weird for even thinking he would even do that. But then he began rambling on how he felt bad and how he had no self control when it came to me, and at that point, I just asked him straight up if he had been touching himself and he said yes.

I then hung up and immediately began crying. I felt disgusted, mostly disappointed, I think, I'm still trying to process it, honestly. He kept texting me about how he was sorry, but also kept saying he couldn't control himself, which just scared me more than anything because I've been in really bad relationships before and he was just reminding me of it.

I let him know how upset I was, through text ofc, I was not about to call him again, and he did apologize at first, but when I told him that I just wanted a friend, he said, directly copied from his text, ""It's your fault for making me feel this way all the flirting too you knew what you were doing making me lose control don't act like your innocent""

I didn't think I was flirting with him over call mostly because I was tired, but I don't know, maybe I did. I also don't know if I'm making a big deal out of nothing. It's not like he touched me without my consent, I couldn't even see him since it was just a voice call, no Facetime.

Buying foods with less packaging/waste.,"I think the ultimate epiphany with anti consumption is the impact our food intake has on a bunch of different industries.  For example the healthcare industry is quite literally bloated because of our obesity endemic from over consumption of foods, ultra processed foods, etc.

The best thing we can do to limit waste and consumption is to basically buy produce, meats, bakery breads, and avoiding the ultra processed foods which make up the bulk of your trashcan.  Some billionaire is profiting off of all that packaging shit that ends up in landfills.  

Whole foods supports farmers, ultra processed foods supports Nestle, etc. 

Intermittent fasting helps limit the consumption of food.  Usually I drink coffee with cream in the morning and dinner in the evening.  Sometimes will have a few pieces of bread or light snacks if im going to be active. That works for me, other ways might work for you depending on what you like to eat. Super foods, teas, herbal tinctures, etc. can help sustain you without feeding the beast. 

Interestingly, when addressing your food consumption you also symbiotically address your health. The better your health, the less disease, the less medications you will consume. ",24,1742232489.0,Anticonsumption,10,0.79,False

* H1B renewal
* Approved I-140

I am based out of the US and wanted to urgently get my new H1b visa stamp. I had applied for a 6 month UK tourist visa from the US earlier in December 2024. There were multiple dates within 1-2 weeks in London and Belfast so decided to book my appointment through the AIS US visa site. My interview was on March 11 and I booked my appointment on March 05. 

  
Overview of my experience : 

* Monday evening : Reach UK 
* Tuesday : Interview date ( 9am)
* Tuesday afternoon : Approved
* Friday morning : Issued
* Following Monday morning : passport pickup
* Tuesday morning : Fly out to US

  
Overall interview experience was super smooth and streamlined. Although my interview was at 9am I reached the embassy at 8:15 ( thanks to jetlag) and entered the embassy. The only question the officer asked me was the name of my company and immediately mentioned that my visa was APPROVED. 

 Note that only small backpacks with Ipads,phones allowed ( STRICTLY NO LAPTOPS). You go through airport style security when you enter the embassy building. In case you have a bigger bag, just head to Sendero Coffee Shop opposite the embassy who have lockers. 

  
Main documents required : 

* DS 160 ( printout) --> in case you don\`t have it there is a shop stones throw away from the embassy 
* Appointment confirmation page
* Passport
* I-797 actual document
* Passport photo ( 2 x 2 US visa)

  
My passport pickup experience was interesting. I did not receive any tracking info so decided to show up at the DX pickup location with a valid ID ( US DL or any ID works) only to be redirected to another location 15 min away. I had to wait for an hour to get my passport back since the transition from DX to Fedex as the pickup location over the weekend. Hope the pickup is smoother going forward. My suggestion would be to NOT rely on the tracking info and if possible show up directly at the pickup location ( ONCE the DS-160 status shows ISSUED). 

Overall, the experience was great and I would highly recommend it especially given that London\`s not a bad place to stay for work/vacation :)",1,1742232410.0,h1b,0,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs how it started:

My best friend, Sarah, was going through a rough breakup. She was devastated, crying every day, and nothing I said seemed to help. One night, after one too many glasses of wine, I jokingly said, ‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôve always had this‚Ä¶¬†*intuition*¬†about people. Like, I can sense things.‚Äù She looked at me with these wide, hopeful eyes and said, ‚ÄúWait, are you psychic?‚Äù

I panicked. I didn‚Äôt want to let her down, so I said‚Ä¶ yes.

Big. Mistake.

At first, it was harmless. I‚Äôd say vague things like, ‚ÄúI feel like you‚Äôre going to meet someone new soon,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI see a tall, dark-haired person in your future.‚Äù She ate it up. She started calling me her ‚Äúspiritual guide‚Äù and even paid for my coffee a few times as a ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù I thought it would fizzle out. It didn‚Äôt.

Word spread. Now, her entire friend group thinks I‚Äôm a legit psychic. They‚Äôve been coming to me for ‚Äúreadings,‚Äù and I‚Äôm making up nonsense on the spot. One girl asked if her ex would come back, and I said, ‚ÄúThe spirits say‚Ä¶ maybe, but only if you focus on yourself first.‚Äù She cried and hugged me. I felt like a monster.

It gets worse. Sarah‚Äôs mom heard about my ‚Äúgift‚Äù and invited me to her book club to do a group reading. I tried to back out, but Sarah begged me, saying it would mean so much to her. So, I went. I sat in a circle of middle-aged women, holding a crystal I bought at a gas station, and made up stuff about their futures. They loved it. Now, they want me to come back every month.

I‚Äôm in too deep. If I come clean, I‚Äôll destroy Sarah‚Äôs trust and look like a total fraud. But if I keep this up, I‚Äôm going to get exposed eventually. I‚Äôve even started researching astrology and tarot cards just to keep the act going. I‚Äôm spending hours online learning how to sound convincing. It‚Äôs exhausting.

Reddit, what do I do? Do I come clean and risk losing my best friend? Or do I keep this charade going and hope no one figures it out? Has anyone else ever been trapped in a lie that just kept growing?

- How many euros in cash do you recommend bringing?
- Do you recommend purchasing and learning to use a nice camera before the trip, or did you find that your iPhone took good enough pictures?
- What are your favorite spots for coffee/breakfast in both Galway and Dublin?
- What are your favorite non-tourist trap shops for souvenirs in Galway, Inis M√≥r, and Dublin?
- What is the best store to find Gaelic/rugby/football kits in either Galway or Dublin?
- When going to pubs, did you bring your passport, or what your state drivers license a sufficient ID if needed?

1jdhyb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/1jdhyb3/starbucks_ordered_to_pay_50_million_after/,Starbucks Ordered to Pay $50 Million After Delivery Driver Suffers Severe Burns,"*A* Los Angeles County jury has awarded $50 million in damages to Michael Garcia, a delivery driver who suffered third-degree burns from a hot tea spill at a Starbucks drive-thru. The verdict comes after a years-long legal battle over the coffee giant‚Äôs handling of scalding beverages and sets a new precedent for similar cases.

Garcia, who regularly picked up orders for delivery services, alleged that in February 2020, a Starbucks employee handed him a cup of hot tea without securing the lid. When the cup spilled, the liquid caused severe burns to his hands, arms, and legs. Court documents detail how Garcia endured multiple skin graft surgeries and now faces permanent injuries that impact his ability to work.

‚ÄúThe jury sent a clear message that companies serving dangerously hot liquids have a responsibility to ensure customer and worker safety,‚Äù Garcia‚Äôs attorney said in a statement following the ruling. Starbucks, which argued in court that the spill resulted from an accident rather than negligence, has not announced whether it plans to appeal.

This case echoes other high-profile lawsuits involving hot beverage spills. The most famous occurred in 1992, when Stella Liebeck successfully sued McDonald's after suffering third-degree burns from their coffee, leading to a landmark product liability case. However, Garcia‚Äôs $50 million award is **25 times higher** than past related settlements, seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dEuKT8qYj2jR7iVkZbceZPVZjFNgvlBrtC4G-lkeyw4/edit?usp=sharing), setting a **new legal precedent** that businesses should take seriously. Reports indicate Starbucks had the opportunity to settle for **$3 million** but chose to take the case to trial.

The case also highlights the importance of **worker safety training** in the food and beverage industry. Experts say comprehensive training programs on proper handling of hot beverages, securing lids, and ensuring safe hand-offs can significantly reduce risks for both employees and customers. Workplace safety advocates argue that consistent reinforcement of safety protocols can help prevent similar incidents, protecting workers and avoiding costly legal battles for businesses.

Legal analysts suggest that this ruling could **increase the risk for businesses facing similar lawsuits**, pushing companies to reassess their safety measures, employee training, and settlement strategies. The verdict underscores the growing expectations for corporate responsibility and the potential financial consequences of neglecting safety protocols.

1jdhvgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1jdhvgy/can_coffee_boost_metabolism_and_increase_fat/,Can Coffee Boost Metabolism and Increase Fat Burning?,"If you‚Äôve ever sipped on a fresh cup of coffee and felt a surge of energy, you‚Äôre not alone. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, loved for its rich flavor and powerful effects on energy levels. But beyond just keeping you awake, can coffee actually help boost metabolism and increase fat burning?

The short answer is **yes**, but let‚Äôs break it down into simple terms, real experiences, and expert insights.

¬†

# How Coffee Affects Your Metabolism

Metabolism is the process by which your body converts food into energy. A faster metabolism means your body burns calories more efficiently, which can help with weight management. **Coffee plays a role in this process due to its caffeine content.**

# Caffeine and Metabolic Boost

Caffeine, a natural stimulant found in coffee, has been shown to **increase thermogenesis**‚Äîthe process where your body generates heat and burns calories. When you drink coffee, your heart rate slightly increases, your energy levels rise, and your body starts burning more fat for fuel.

According to **nutrition expert Daniel Carter**, who has worked with coffee enthusiasts and athletes, ‚ÄúCoffee isn‚Äôt a magic weight-loss drink, but when consumed correctly, it can support a healthy metabolism and fat-burning process.‚Äù

# Real-Life Experience: How Coffee Helped Sarah Stay Fit

Sarah, a 35-year-old fitness coach, shares her story:

""I started drinking black coffee every morning before my workout, and I noticed that I had more endurance and energy. It helped me push harder, and over time, I started seeing better results in my fat loss journey. I also felt less hungry throughout the day, which helped me manage my calorie intake.""

Like Sarah, many coffee lovers have experienced similar benefits when combining coffee with a healthy lifestyle.

¬†

# Can Coffee Help You Burn Fat?

Yes! Coffee not only increases metabolism but also enhances the body's ability to burn fat.

# 1. Coffee Mobilizes Fat from Fat Cells

Caffeine stimulates the nervous system, sending signals to fat cells to break down fat. This releases **free fatty acids into the bloodstream**, making them available as energy.

# 2. Coffee Increases Fat Oxidation

In simple terms, caffeine helps your body **use fat for energy instead of storing it**. This is especially useful if you drink coffee before exercising.

Dr. Lisa Thompson, a dietitian specializing in metabolism, says:""Drinking coffee before a workout can improve fat oxidation, meaning your body is more likely to burn fat as fuel. Just make sure to avoid high-calorie, sugary coffee drinks, as they can counteract these benefits.""

# 3. Coffee Reduces Appetite

Many coffee drinkers report that they feel **less hungry after drinking coffee**. This is because caffeine affects hormones that control appetite.

Alex, a 42-year-old business owner, shares his experience:""I used to snack a lot between meals, but after switching to black coffee, I noticed that my cravings reduced. It helped me stick to my diet and lose 10 pounds over six months.""

¬†

# The Best Way to Drink Coffee for Metabolism & Fat Burning

Not all coffee drinks are created equal. If you want to maximize the metabolism-boosting effects of coffee, here are some expert recommendations:

# ‚úÖ Drink Black Coffee

¬∑¬†Black coffee has **zero calories**¬†and provides all the fat-burning benefits without added sugar or cream.

# ‚úÖ Time Your Coffee Right

¬∑¬†The best time to drink coffee for fat burning is **in the morning**¬†or **before a workout**.

# ‚úÖ Avoid Sugary Additives

¬∑¬†Fancy coffee drinks loaded with syrups, milk, and whipped cream can **add hundreds of unnecessary calories**, reducing the fat-burning benefits.

# ‚úÖ Stay Hydrated

¬∑¬†Coffee is a diuretic, meaning it can cause dehydration. Drink enough water to stay balanced.

¬†

# What Coffee Experts Say

We reached out to coffee industry professionals to get their take on coffee and metabolism.

# Interview with Mark Johnson, Coffee Roaster

""The quality of coffee matters. If you drink organic, high-quality coffee with natural compounds intact, you get more benefits than low-grade instant coffee loaded with artificial flavors.""

# Interview with Jenny Roberts, Barista & Nutrition Coach

""One of the best ways to enjoy coffee for metabolism is to have it black or with a splash of unsweetened almond milk. Also, don‚Äôt drink coffee late in the evening, as it can disrupt your sleep, which is essential for a healthy metabolism.""

¬†

# Final Thoughts: Can Coffee Really Boost Metabolism?

Yes, coffee can **increase metabolism, enhance fat burning, and suppress appetite**, making it a helpful tool for weight management. However, it works best when combined with:‚úÖ A balanced diet‚úÖ Regular exercise‚úÖ Good sleep habits

1jdhtue,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jdhtue/why_are_exotic_coffees_so_expensive_as_a_coffee/,"Why Are Exotic Coffees So Expensive? As a Coffee Farmer, Let Me Tell You the Truth Behind the Price","If you've ever wondered why a Geisha, Bourbon Rosado, or Eugenioides can cost three, five, or even ten times more than a regular coffee, let me break it down for you.

Fewer trees per hectare
Most exotic coffee varieties, like Geisha, are tall-growing trees, which means they take up much more space than traditional coffee plants. On a farm where you could plant 6,000 conventional coffee trees (which are usually medium or short in height), you can only fit around 2,000 Geisha trees. And to make matters worse, despite being larger, each Geisha tree produces only half the amount of cherries compared to a regular coffee tree.

More vulnerable to diseases
Not only do they produce less, but they are also more susceptible to diseases and pests. Leaf rust, for example, can wipe them out easily, and in humid regions, fungal infections can become a serious issue. Taking care of them requires more labor, higher investments in prevention, and, in many cases, accepting that you‚Äôll lose a portion of your harvest every year.

They take longer to produce fruit
While some commercial varieties can start producing coffee in two years, exotic coffees often take three years or more to give their first decent harvest. And there‚Äôs no guarantee that all trees will survive.

Growing them is hard, but processing them is even harder
The work doesn‚Äôt stop once the cherries are ripe. For an exotic coffee to truly shine, it needs to be fermented, dried, and roasted with surgical precision. A mistake in fermentation or drying can ruin months (or even years) of work.

Low supply, high demand
These varieties are produced in small quantities because very few farmers can take on the costs and risks of growing them. And with limited supply in the market, prices naturally go up.

The flavor really is different
It‚Äôs not just marketing‚Äîcoffees like Geisha can have jasmine, tropical fruit, or even fresh bell pepper notes in the cherry. You don‚Äôt come across a coffee with that kind of complexity and clarity every day.

The price reflects the risk and effort.

Growing exotic coffee is a gamble. They‚Äôre harder to manage, require more care, and rely on buyers willing to pay their real value. As farmers, we take the risk of investing in varieties that could bring us incredible flavors‚Ä¶ or significant losses.

So when you pay more for an exotic coffee, you‚Äôre not just paying for the name‚Äîyou‚Äôre paying for years of work, risk, and effort from seed to cup. And trust me, as a coffee grower, making every bean worth it is no easy task.

Hello my next best bro!

I'm a 32-year-old guy living in Europe. Looking to connect with other guys who enjoy both outdoor adventures and city life. I'm into a variety of activities - from hitting the beach and surfing to exploring urban landscapes and enjoying nature hikes. You can usually find me at the gym or a local library.

I appreciate meaningful conversations and am always up for watching films, reading books, or just hanging out. My travels have taken me to different scenic spots, and I'm always eager to hear recommendations about new places to explore!

When I'm not traveling, I enjoy spending time with friends and appreciating good coffee. I'm openly gay and value authentic connections with people from all backgrounds. 

Would love to meet like-minded guys around my age who are looking for a genuine friendship. Happy to chat about travel experiences, share movie recommendations, or discuss anything interesting going on in your life!

Krystal Voss

There I was, fully nude in front of the stocky, intimidating, masculine female officer. I attempted to put my clothes back on after a daily strip search as a condition of my work place.

""There is a new procedure"" she interrupted, ""You have to spread your labia."" The officer grinned; the first time I'd ever seen her smile, in the year or more she had worked at Denver Women's Correctional Facility.

My jaw dropped and I must have looked at her like she was insane.

""You know what that is?"" She asked me.

""Yes, I know what that is."" I replied and I wondered if she was just coming on to me, or if it was a real procedure. Nothing was posted. But then, the new warden had a habit of changing procedure on a whim, without any notice. (We heard it even bothered his staff.) Reluctantly, I opened my most intimate part to this complete (apparently) lesbian stranger and her obvious enjoyment of the display. Now, I'm not modest or any kind of prude, yet, this new procedure disturbed me to the very core.

All our workers were in a panic. The news spread like wildfire. I helped circulate sample grievances, citing Administrative Regulations, Colorado Revised Statutes, Constitutional Amendments and the women added their personal anguish between the lines. Many families were told not to visit, due to searches after visits. Nobody wanted to do a porn pose for any officer. It felt like sexual harassment. In the coming weeks, so many grievances were filed on this procedure, a general statement was posted and every one came back with the same generic posted answer.

After I filed my step one grievance, a captain called me to the block office in the unit to chat. She and I argued civilly about the demeanor the officer used with me.

""No staff likes to do this procedure."" She insisted.

I raised body fluid and sanitation issues.

""If you just open your labia farther back from the opening; just pinch the skin and pull open slightly, you won't get fluid on your fingers. This is not an invasive procedure,"" she countered.

What about menstrual times? What about women who have fluid all over? The different arguments spun in my mind and tumbled out of my mouth.

Eventually, the captain turned the questioning to me.

How long had I been incarcerated? (Five plus years.) How many grievances had Ifiled during that time? (Less than five.) On what? (Religious rights, medical diets, legal mail and this.) How many write-ups during this time? (None.)

""Well, that is impressive."" She said with a haughty air. I felt demeaned, yet, thanked her for her time and asserted I'd continue my grievances.

Fortunately, the change in policy of daily strip searches at the print shop became random, in line with every other work crew. Yet, that does not stop a particular officer from choosing me every time she enters the shop to strip some and pat search the rest. She likes to direct us to prop our foot on a toilet, after the full ""proper"" search to hold open our labia and pause, as she bends down, often with her face less than a foot away, to examine.

""What is she looking for?!"" My enraged brain screams silently, the whole time spread and naked, alone with authority.

""This isn't my favorite part either."" She says quasi-sympathetically, while handing my clothing back, opened, like she's dressing a child.

""It is not necessary, and I'm filing a complaint with the Feds. We'll let a judge decide,"" I coldly replied.

""Oh!"" She answered, shock registering on her face.

I stormed out of the shop, dreading the next time that officer walks in to do security detail. It will happen all over again.

The stories are much worse. The whole thing began in a restricted privileges/discipline unit. It was reported to me by women living there at the time, one woman was threatened with pepper spray until compliance. Stories of hidden pills, needles, syringes circulated and changed when staff justified why it began; why it was necessary to prevent anything being held in a piece of body tissue lacking musculature.

Women could not sleep and experienced flashbacks from sexual abuse. Mental health providers brought a flood of concerns to the Administration. It fell upon closed ears.

Step after step of the grievance process was denied. Then, someone collected letters from a dozen of us for a journalist friend. Nothing happened for a few months. I thought it was a dead end. Then, in July 2010, media attention brought letters from a prominent attorney at the Washington DC ACLU. The women were quietly rallied to write him their personal stories. This has lead to a ""cease and desist"" letter to the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC). from the A.C.L.U. As of writing this, no change has come. My prisoner's complaint is nearly ready. A couple women and I are filing on behalf of all the women in the facility. I want a permanent injunction to stop the labia lift. Stop the trauma to these women, stop the icky feeling of abuse that comes from even the most removed demeanors of some officers during the searches, and stop this madness!

The most concerning facet of this particular spot of my incarceration journey is the sexual connotation of authority getting too close to our body parts. The ""Prison Rape Elimination Act"" was put in place to prevent sexual activity between inmates and officers. (Yet, the hotline established does a victim no good in the middle of the night, when phones are shut off!) Inmates are constantly being threatened with ""PREA write ups"" if caught hugging a friend or even touching an arm or hand in conversation. The Code of Penal Discipline handbook and Administrative Regulations are full of admonishments against any kind of sexual contact or activity, implied or direct. How fair is it that two of my friends were taken to the hole for one brushing fingertips against the other‚Äôs neck in Medline? Removing an errant hair or an insect in a public place versus non-medical personnel examining our clitorises in private seems a little imbalanced.

The facility had gone to great lengths to separate ""couples"". All the medium unit pods were issued separate library and gym time. Joint law library appointments were scrutinized for so called ""custody issues"". If two who were seen together often entered a bathroom at the same time, an officer was likely to bust in, with her keys silenced. The cameras posted at each bathroom door and day room inaccurately told all. This kind of harassment met my roommate and her friend. The officer found them brushing their teeth. They were in innocent company, with coffee pots and oral hygiene products, when under the guise of security, the ""labia lift"" entered the scene!¬† The double standard is disgusting!

Then, even more concerning, is the newest C.O.P.D. addition of ""false reporting"", as a class I offense. One could lose honor housing, incentive jobs, hobby privileges, 90 days good time and spend time in the hole if a report is determined to be false. How can an inmate prove what happens, alone, naked, with an officer? Whose word will they believe? What ""proof"" do we have? This is pushing a lot of women into silence. After my experience with the captain denying my validity on any arguments, who actually cares that this happens?

I‚Äôm serving thirty years, twenty-five and a half, with maximum good time. How can I and other women who have much more time on a sentence, stand by and let them inflict this indignity on us without doing everything we can to stop this?

1. Anyone here a part of the Film program? What has your experience been like?

I‚Äôm huge into making documentaries; as a matter of fact, I‚Äôm working on one right now about postsecondary education programs for people with intellectual disabilities. Also have a soft spot for more experimental, arthouse-type films. The hope is to eventually get my MFA and teach film. Want to share my love for the art form with others.

2. Is it easy to find community on campus? I‚Äôm your standard artsy type with a bit of nerd and punk rocker thrown in and a heaping scoop of autism to finish it off. Love D&D, hardcore shows, art museums, and ranting about high speed rail for 45 straight minutes (that last part actually happened).

3. What‚Äôs the city of Rochester like? Wanna hear the inside scoop. Bonus points if you suggest a good coffee shop to help fuel my caffeine addiction‚Ä¶

I do not have a job, I have been applying everywhere in our town for almost two years and cant get accepted anywhere. We go to different schools btw. Were on Spring break for two weeks now

Lately I feel like she hasn't been making time for me to hangout or even to just talk. And I get it shes tired from work, I know. But yesterday I asked if she wanted to grab a coffee, go for a walk and do a cute little painting date Ive been wanting to do. She told me no and that she wanted to stay home, chill and clean. I was okay with that because I know she needs it, but she ended up going to another town to go shopping the whole day and then went to her grandmas. I got a bit annoyed because she ghosted me the whole day but who cares. This morning I text her if she would want to hangout and do the thing I wanted to do before. Again she told me no and said her friend asked her yesterday if she wanted to hangout and thats what theyre doing today. I told her its okay and that I was a bit annoyed. Then she sent me a long text a few minutes later telling me that tomorrow shes hanging out with a friend before she works, then on Wednesday shes going to clean the whole day. Then Thursday and Friday shes going to her grandmas again to sleepover and hangout. Saturday shes works. Sunday she says she has plans but cant remember what. Monday and Tuesday she works. Then March 26-29 shes leaving town with her grandmas again to visit her friend.

I dont know if I'm just super clingy but thats a huge wait before I can see her again. Yesterday I tried to stay productive but I still had so much time and I just sat around. I have even less stuff I can do today and itll stay that way. I dont have very many friends, the ones I do have are on a trip with their school.

I still have feelings for her.,"M (35) was in contact (on Social Media - Instagram) with F (47, divorced, with one adult child) for like a half a year. After a failed attempt to meet in person a couple of weeks after we started talking, when I deactivated my account due to personal issues, and she didn\`t hear back from me until Christmas, we started to chat again from time to time. I proposed to her to meet in person¬†last week, which we did.¬†

¬†She is into me for sure, but she was reticent to move forward to meet me in person as she considers me too young (which is not true at all) but might consider me like some sort of FWB. ¬†She didn\`t want to meet with me in a coffee shop or bar or similar, as she said she had not done this (hanging out with a younger guy) until now. So we met in a quiet location, where we mostly kissed. We have stayed for an hour. I would like to mention that after she saw me in person she changed, meaning that instead of inviting me to her place (which was supposed to be the week after), she moved it faster, making time during the weekend.

¬†I spent the evening at her place. We drank some wine, have had sex, Both felt great, and the sex was excellent. However, literally while on top of me, she told me that SHE WILL SEE AN OLDER GUY (C), a date planned for today.  She even shared a photo with the guy and said she did not like him. I asked her if she could cancel this date, as I felt that we were one into another. She declined to give a clear answer, as the date had been arranged by one of her friends, but she said she might consider it. She asked me to spend the entire night at her place, which I wasn\`t able to do so I left after midnight.

¬†I got home, text her saying that I arrived, she asked if everything is ok and we have said good night.

¬†Starting from Sunday morning, I felt everything changed. I felt the distance she wanted to take on me (she stopped initiating conversation). I just said good morning and left her alone until today.

¬†It was the same today. I sent her a text a couple of hours ago asking if she was ok, answered yes. I asked for a photo with her, but she declined. Somehow, we\`ve moved to the date topic and I have confronted her on this. I got on why she had not told me about this when we decided to meet in person. We exchanged some texts, eventually dumping her. I also bragged about the old guy (made a bit of fun of him) and that if she wants a guy like that one, she can have it.

What pisses me is why she hasn\`t told me that she has a planned date (like from the start of last week, when she proposed the deal)? It\`s not like I would have 100% rejected her proposal, but I would have had all the facts, therefore I could have been able to make the right decision. She said I\`m overreacting because it\`s not like she would make it with him.

¬†I dumped her but I do have feelings for her. Did I overreact? Should I have left space for a possible reconciliation?

I am also mad as I feel cheated, used, and lied to, but I am still thinking about her. Have I proceeded correctly?

Now I‚Äôm Counting Down.,"I needed a job‚Äîbadly. So when an office assistant position opened up at a company I‚Äôd never heard of, I jumped on it. The interview was weird. No talk of salary, benefits, or even job duties. Just a single sheet of paper slid across the desk with a list of ten rules.

‚ÄúFollow these exactly,‚Äù the interviewer, a pale man in a gray suit, said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do just fine.‚Äù

I should have walked out. But desperation makes you ignore red flags.

  
**RULES FOR EMPLOYMENT:**

1. Arrive at 8:00 AM sharp. No earlier, no later.
2. Do not acknowledge the man in the janitor‚Äôs closet.
3. If the phone rings at exactly 12:15 PM, do not answer it.
4. Always leave before 6:00 PM.
5. If you hear typing from the empty cubicle, ignore it.
6. The coffee in the breakroom is not for you.
7. Never take the elevator alone.
8. If you see your own reflection smile at you, look away immediately.
9. The emergency exit is for emergencies only. Real emergencies.
10. Never, under any circumstances, break a rule.

I should have run. But the salary was listed at an obscene number. Enough to dig me out of debt and start over. I signed the contract.

For the first few days, nothing happened. I did mindless paperwork, ignored the janitor‚Äôs closet, and pretended not to hear the occasional burst of typing from an empty desk. My coworkers were polite but distant. No one talked about the rules. No one asked questions.

By the end of my first week, I was starting to feel safe. Maybe it was all a stupid hazing ritual. A test of obedience.

Then I broke a rule.

It was an accident. I stayed late one night, caught up in a mountain of files. When I finally glanced at the clock, it was 6:17 PM.

My stomach dropped.

The office was silent. Too silent. The kind of silence that presses in on your ears. I grabbed my bag and walked quickly to the exit, my footsteps suddenly too loud. I told myself it was fine. The building hadn‚Äôt exploded. No alarms had gone off.

Then I heard it.

Click.

A single keystroke in the darkness. Then another. And another. A steady rhythm of typing coming from the empty cubicle across the room. My skin prickled. The typing stopped. I held my breath. Something shifted in the darkness. A chair creaked. Then, the whisper.

‚ÄúSix.‚Äù

A cold breath of air brushed against my ear, though no one was there. I ran. The next morning, the rule sheet on my desk had changed. A new rule had appeared at the bottom, typed in the same crisp font as the rest:

**11. You have six days.**

I asked my coworkers about it. They wouldn‚Äôt meet my eyes. One finally muttered, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break any more rules.‚Äù I did everything perfectly that day. I arrived at exactly 8:00 AM. I ignored the janitor‚Äôs closet, the phantom typing, the too-warm coffee. But at 12:15 PM, the phone on my desk rang.

I stared at it. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to answer. But now I had six days to‚Ä¶ what? To live? To work here? I needed answers. I picked up. Static hissed on the other end. Then a voice, warped and distant:

‚ÄúFive.‚Äù

Click.

The rules are changing. Each morning, my countdown updates. **Four days.** **Three.**

I‚Äôve been careful. I follow every rule. But last night, as I left the office at exactly 5:59 PM, I caught my reflection in the glass doors. It smiled. I looked away immediately, heart hammering. But in that brief moment, I saw something move behind me in the reflection. Something tall. Something wrong.

**Two days.**

I don‚Äôt know what happens when the countdown reaches zero. No one will tell me. I just know I don‚Äôt want to be here to find out. 

Tomorrow, I‚Äôm breaking Rule #9. I‚Äôm taking the emergency exit.

The last time, I was one year free but I failed at a Christmas dinner. That led to time to time cigarettes and that went full circle to smoking again. Also, I did it with the Allen Carr book and it was so... Easy? That I think I lost the fear of the nicotine effects I guess. 

The good news is this time I just smoked like five months consistently before quitting again (the book helped on this because once you understand how the nicotine trap works you are on a unconfortable point where you can be smoking but no longer enjoy it how you used to).

Anyway I stopped last week so this is my day seven and honestly I feel great. I only have sporadic urges of smoking but they are really soft and mostly when my brain is still malfunctioning aka, when I just woke up. Some pattern I noticed in my case is that when I stop smoking the best thing I can do to forget about it and not feel the intense withdrawls is turning around to a healthy lifestyle. It makes the body heal faster and knowing that, I feel more motivated. Some examples in case it helps:

-I drink good things (water, Green tea, Miso soup and matcha latte) because it gives me something to be entertained with and it hydrates me, what makes me honestly excited about how much my skin will improve.

-I buy and use consistently body care products because one of the reasons why I stopped smoking was the smell of the cigarettes so it makes me happy having a long lasting vanilla and flowers scent.

-I quit coffee because it dehydrates and honestly, the matcha killed the caffeine withdrawals so why not?

-I eat consistently tangerines, bananas and all those healthy and colorful ingredients because I never liked veggies so I try my best on this. And junk food is heavily asociated with smoking afterwards in my brain so I preffer to limit it.

-I try to read pretty often about benefits of quitting and what happens x time after you do it because it keeps me on track when I feel down. Also, revisiting some chapters of the Allen Carr's book from time to time helps a lot.

The biggest reasons are as follows :

1. Ukraine continues to crumble. The war has been moving in Russia's favour and they need to continue pressing as their advantage will keep growing over the next 2 years.  

2. Donald might end up completely cutting off Ukraine which add to the ever growing number of allies that have been abandoned. The US and allies fighting is also forming cracks in western unity. 

3. Europe seizing Russian assets would be the cherry on top for global monetary realignment.

All of this works in the favour of the majority of the population of the world, which is not in the western countries.

1. Countries now have the opportunity to set up their own tech industries and try to be the bigger players locally creating massive wealth.

2. Trading in local currencies makes things more accessible.  

3. Opening of new trade opportunities has been a massive blessing. European goods have gotten really expensive which has created a parallel market of goods from turkey, Egypt and Russia. My coffee used to nescafe uk for 15$ now it's bescafe russia for 4$

4. Majority of the raw resources, goods produced and services rendered are in the non western part of the world. Yet the western countries enjoy a better Qol due to their strong currencies. 

The war in Ukraine will indirectly uplift the lives of billions of people across the world, while the qol of western countries goes down slightly. This also will help in reducing brain drain and immigration into the western countries and finally allow the non-western countries to develop. ",0,1742230374.0,changemyview,25,0.12,False

- Michelle: I'm more shy and quiet than most people on reality TV, but this is my life, and I want you all to know the real me. I do think in order to understand who I am, you really need to kind of know where I come from and how I got here. So I have two immigrant parents that came to LA in 1985.
- Michelle: My mom is from Culiacan, Mexico, and my dad is from Tehran, Iran. They were both born and raised in their countries and decided to move to LA in their 30s. My dad was super intelligent, very strict with me, and he spoke five languages, hence why I have a little accent.
- Michelle: I was raised by two parents that came from two different sides of the world, and I loved it because I got to experience two different cultures, food, languages, lifestyles. But they were both super loving, and I couldn't have had a better upbringing in terms of love. I saw my parents truly love each other, respect one another, and it was an ideal marriage, at least in terms of my eyes.
- Michelle: Prior to my parents getting married, my mom was actually married in Mexico and had my brother and sister, but her first husband passed away in a plane crash, and that is one of the reasons why she went to LA. That is when she met my dad, and my dad said, come to LA, I want to get married, and he raised my brother and sister as if it was his own children. So I never even got to feel that I had a half-brother or sister to me they were just my brother and sister.
- Michelle: So for a very long time, everything was amazing with my parents, my brother and sister. You would call it like the perfect family. I didn't see them fight, they respected each other. My dad was romantic. It was just like a very loving, normal household. And when I was about 12 years old, things slowly started changing with my dad's personality and mental state.
- Michelle: My sister was studying psychology. She was getting a master's degree, and my mom would tell my sister the things that my dad was saying and doing. And we all had to sit down and have a conversation with him that he needed to get help and maybe get diagnosed.
- Michelle: And that is when I remember my dad picked me up from school one day and sat me down. And it was the first time I saw my dad cry. And he asked me if it was okay if he divorced my mom and if he could leave me because he didn't think it was safe for me to be around. And I said yes. 
- Michelle: So my life drastically changed in a matter of a day. I went from loving parents to suddenly my mom has to get her act together and figure out how to financially take care of me to get a job and to do everything else at the house.
- Michelle: I was raised in West Hollywood and then we went to a really nice neighborhood in South Pasadena. That's where I lived with my parents. And I went from living to a very nice community to all of a sudden I had to move to San Diego by the border, a city called San Ysidro and everybody lived by the Mexican border.
- Michelle: So it was, you either lived in Mexico or in San Ysidro and everybody spoke Spanish and it was just like a completely different culture change overnight for me. So fast forward to a crazy high school where I have girls just want to fight me and it was just really hard because they called me the white girl. 
- Michelle: So I never really quite fit in because when I lived in LA, I was the Mexican Persian girl with the accent and then I go to a Mexican school and then I'm the white girl. So I was just always out of place. 
- Michelle: Then I go to college and I have to support myself because my brother and sister had a degree. So I have to, of course, have a degree just because I want to be like everybody else.
- Michelle: And that was always important to my dad. He always thought no matter what, school, even with a new generation, that you need to have that knowledge and background. So to me, I was like, okay, I'm gonna go to Cal State, get a degree, but I also have to pay for school.
- Michelle: And there was a Hooters nearby. So I was like, what is the best way to have a night job, get paid well and go to school? So I was a Hooters girl for about five to six years.

Getting into Real estate (Timestamp: 8:45)
- Michelle: And so when I graduated, I knew I got a business degree. I knew I wanted to be a real estate agent. My brother owned my brother was a very successful lender. So I graduated, I went and moved in with my brother while I was studying to get my real estate license. And I was his assistant.
- Michelle started with doing cold calling and asking people if they wanted to sell their house 
- Michelle: And it was kind of crazy because I got my license. And in the matter of eight months, I sold 19 houses all by myself. And I worked for a prestigious company in San Diego, Coldwell Banker, and I got Rookie of the Year.

Ryan Serhant from Million Dollar Listing (timestamp: 9:43)
- Michelle: My brother at the time, so I started doing really well. And he's like, have you ever watched Million Dollar Listing New York? I had never seen it. So I started watching it. And I'm like, holy shit, I want to be just like these guys.
- Michelle: They sell $10 million condos, 20 million. They're hustlers. They wear nice suits. I want to be that version in a woman. So I Google all of their names and email, and I email all of them. 
- Michelle: And Ryan Serhant emails me back, and he says, I'm opening up an office in LA. I'll be there next week if you want to have a meeting. So I did.
- Michelle: So I impressed him with what I told him. And I think he saw what a go getter I was, and that I just had huge dreams for myself. And he hired me immediately. He said, you can work under my team.
- Michelle worked for Nest Seekers and then Hilton & Hyland

Jesse (timestamp: 17:24)
- Michelle: And Jesse Lally was working at Hilton and Hyland, and he saw me, and so he follows me down the street, hoping that I get off the phone, which I don't. So then he actually messages me on Facebook. This is back in 2015.
- Michelle: He messages me on Facebook, and he says something cheesy. It was like, I don't even remember. It was something about air conditioning. It was really hot. So I had never seen him in person. When he messaged me, he had seen me.
- Michele: And he asked me, hey, we have an office meeting on Tuesday. Would you like to go out on a date with me that night? And I said, sure. And he's like, great. Why don't we have a cup of coffee before the office meeting so you can get to know who I am, and then we'll go out at night. 
- Michelle: So I see him, and I think he's very handsome, but he does literally all the wrong things any guy can ever do. He sits down. Apparently, he had like 20 cups of coffee. He doesn't ask me a single question about me.
- Michelle: He's just talking about rambling on about himself, and then he's saying things like, oh, I just got out of a committed five-year relationship, and I don't want anything serious, and I'm just looking. Like, he's just, that is not what I wanted to hear. Mind you, in my mind, I'm like, I need to be married before 30.
- Michelle: So I was trying to find a serious boyfriend, a serious relationship, and he's literally telling me the opposite of what I want to hear. So I go to the office meeting. I'm like, how am I going to get out of this date?
- Michelle: And so that night, I text him, I'm so sorry, I have a migraine, and I end up going out with my girls. So this is the infamous story, because a lot of people, I got feedback, and they're like, why would you have a child with a one night stand? But I don't think people realize that that is not what I was looking for.
- Michelle: I go out with my girlfriends, yes, I get drunk, and I'm like, okay, I'm just gonna, he's not husband material, so I'm just gonna use him as a booty call. And that is what I did. So the following day, he actually acts totally normal. He's contacting me, he's texting me, he wants to see me, and we just start spending every day together. And that is what I was looking for. I wanted something serious.
- Michelle: So it was very contradicting what he first told me when he met me as to how he was treating me. And him and I started going out a lot, going to restaurants, sitting at bars, and people, we were just organically having conversations with people about the real estate market and about buying and selling. 
- Michelle: And so we would meet people and they're like, oh, we want to look for a house. We're like, oh, we can help you. So we just became partners without even trying to be partners because it just made sense.
- Michelle: I think people get confused because they saw the very end of our relationship, but it wasn't like that in the beginning. It was amazing. It was easy. What I loved most about Jesse is that I saw that we could build a great life together, that I could have a partner, that we didn't have a lot of money at the time. And throughout the years, we were doing bigger deals.
- Michelle: We started from 3 million to 10 million to 20 million. We sold the house for 40 million. And I just saw that we could enjoy life, travel and just do it together. And that's really what I wanted because all my life, I felt like I always did everything on my own and I wanted that partner. 
- Michelle: So Jesse and I were together for a long time and things were really good. There were obviously red flags, but when you're young, you don't really pay attention to them or you just think, you brush them under the rug and you just think it's going to be fine. 
- Michelle: And for the most part, things were good. And I just thought nobody's perfect. It'll be okay. We'll figure it out and just keep moving forward.

Meeting Jax and Brittany (Timestamp: 21:51)
- Michelle: While we were married, Jesse and I are constantly going out, meeting people, and we meet two very important people, Jax and Brittany. Apparently, Jax and Jesse were roommates over 20 years ago. They lived in New York City, and they were trying to be actors and models.
- Michelle: They had a falling out, and I don't really know what happened, and I think that's their story to tell. So Jax and Jesse finally reconnected once Jesse and I were married, and he introduced me to Brittany. I remember when Brittany and I first met, we talked about how old we were, we're the same age, then she mentioned she was a Hooters girl, and I said it too,

When Michelle had Isabella (Timestamp: 
- Michelle had Isabella in April 2020 which was right after things started shutting down due to Covid
- Michelle: So, so I arrived to the hospital and I said, give me that epidural immediately. And Jesse was very anti everything. He wanted natural. I'm like, this is not happening. I'm four centimeters and I'm going to die. So give me it now. So they gave it to me. And when I did do the epidural, I was stuck at seven centimeters for like a day.
- Michelle: And so my doctor was like, you have high pressure. I wasn't feeling well. He's like, if we don't do something about it, then we're going to have to do C-section.
- Michelle: And then Jesse starts arguing with the doctor, like, no, she's not going to have, there was something he wanted to help induce me. And they're arguing he's, and finally my doctor is like, do you want her to die? Or do you want to have a healthy baby? We're doing this now. I'm overruling you and she's, and I'm doing it. And he did it. And thank god that night I delivered Isabella.

Things starting to get bad in Michelle‚Äôs marriage (Timestamp: 32:09)
- Michelle: But once I had a child, your life instantly changes as a mother. And that is when things slowly started changing. And this is the part that my marriage became a nightmare.
- Michelle: It was a very lonely time for me, but my world at the time was my daughter in my home. And unfortunately, that wasn't the same with Jesse. He continued his life as if he was still kind of a single guy. And I was expected to be at home. And he really kind of stopped communicating with me. He was gone all the time.
- Michelle: And even when he was home, he was always on the phone, or he had his vodka on the rocks. And I never had that one-on-one where somebody asked me how I'm doing or would have a conversation with me. And he was just getting further away while I was becoming more of a mother.
- Michelle: He was not doing his part in trying to be a father. A lot of people ask me, why didn't I leave sooner? But when you're married, you don't just walk away. It takes time. And us as women, it's like you're married. I got married and I had no intention of ever getting divorced. I wanted to be married to him for the rest of my life. That was my mindset and what I wanted as a goal of happiness. But he changed and not for the better.
- Michelle: I felt like I grew and he was just going backwards in life. And I stayed, I stayed as long as I did because the unknown is super scary. I had no idea how was I going to start all over in my 30s, now with the child and have to move out and possibly get a new work at a different place because we work at the same office.
- Michelle: And my life with Jessie was very intertwined. We had worked together our entire relationship. We did a TV show together, we share a child together. And it was just so scary to think that I would be literally starting over from scratch. 
- Michelle: And it takes a lot to be able to tell yourself, like, this is not what I deserve, this is not what I want in my life, and I'm gonna do something about it and start over, even though it's gonna be one of the hardest things I have to do in my life. So our relationship really started changing once we had a child.
- Michelle: And when Isabella was about one years old, that's when we were introduced about possibly doing a reality TV show together. And things weren't that bad. There were, you know, I thought there were bumpy roads and ups and downs and marriages, so I just thought this was something that was gonna get better with time.
- Michelle: And then we get a call and they're like, we're gonna start doing this show soon. And that was literally the worst time of our relationship. And it was also the worst time of my life. I had the worst news anybody could ever get before starting to film a TV show.
- Michelle then said that right before filming, she found out her mom had stage 4 cancer
- Michelle: And this is probably a week or two before I start filming the show. So internally, I'm going through such a difficult marriage, and I'm confused because I don't know what to do. I'm like, do I leave? Do I stay? Do I do this TV show? My mom has cancer. What does that mean? I've never known anybody to be sick, let alone cancer. And it was stage four. So they said she had to have surgery immediately and then do chemo right after.
- Michelle: So right, I think it was a week before filming, I had to go to San Diego, be with my mom while she had all of these surgeries, and then go into filming, while me and my husband want to kill each other, and everything is just horrible. And I thought, naive of me, but I had never seen reality TV. I had thought I could just hide it, and not say anything, and just keep it to myself.
- Michelle: And now watching back the show, I see how miserable I was, and how much I was actually going through mentally. And I tried to hide it, and I've heard that I look like a robot, and I think it's because I was. I didn't know how to handle it internally. I didn't know if was my mom gonna get better with chemo? Was she gonna die? Like there was just so many unknowns.
- Michelle: And I could not at the time make the decision whether I was gonna stay or leave. 

The first time Michelle told Jesse she wanted a divorce (Timestamp: 37:41)
- Michelle: One thing I wanna mention is before filming, there was a point where Jessie and I were really bad. And I didn't even think about it.
- Michelle: And I just sat him down and I'm like, I wanna divorce, this is horrible. I'm gonna get an apartment a block away and we'll figure it out and we can do therapy. And I remember doing it in my office because I just didn't want him to change my mind. And he was crying so much. And it was a four hour conversation. And he really begged me.
- Michelle: And he made me feel like he woke up and was going to change. And I was very vocal. I told him that I was so unhappy. And all of the things he did were very severe. His drinking was very severe. His spending habits were very severe. Him never being home. It was just, it took a real toll on our relationship. And so he promised me and he said, give me a year.
- Michelle: And if you're unhappy in a year, I will walk away. And I will make sure you're taken care of. I will make sure everything is good. And I said, well, I owe that to our marriage and to our daughter. And so I did stay because I wanted to give him that last chance. So I gave him the chance and that's when we got the call that we were gonna start filming.
- Michelle: So I was giving him the opportunity when in fact, I was already mentally done. And Jesse can be very convincing. And he convinced me that he was going to change and he was going to do anything to fix the marriage.
- Michelle: And he guaranteed me and promised me that he would make sure that everything would go smoothly even if I wanted to leave. And that didn't happen. I should have known, but that didn't happen.
- Michelle: And I'm still struggling, but I'm happy that I left because I'm not miserable every single day. And so much has happened since then. And it's a very difficult divorce. I think I'm going through one of the most difficult and complicated divorce because I'm dealing with a difficult person. 
- Michelle: And even though it should be easier, it's not, but I'm trying to navigate that because I know that this is not going to last forever. I was in a really bad place mentally while filming, and it really showed in my demeanor.
- Michelle: And I was just so unhappy, and I wasn't true to myself. 

When Michelle left (Timestamp: 40:20)
- Michelle: And finally, when we stopped filming, I just realized like it's now or never. I have a, at the time, two-year-old. I don't want to do it when she's 10. Why am I going to be unhappy year after year? This is not what I signed up for. This isn't, when I said I do, this was not the agreement. 
- Michelle: And so we had a wedding anniversary right after filming. And I just told myself like, do I want another wedding anniversary and be miserable? And I said, no. So I woke up and I sat him down and I said, there is nothing you can do or say to change my mind. So please listen to what I have to say.
- Michelle: And I feel like I was very fair. I said, I gave you the time, but I'm going to ask for a divorce. Nothing's changed and I want it to be as easy as possible. I don't want to take your child away. I want to be 50-50. I want to live near each other. I want to learn to co-parent and be friends with one another. And I think that I couldn't have made it easier on him. And I realized that I had a responsibility to show my daughter what a healthy relationship was
- Michelle said she is starting this podcast because, ‚ÄúI want you to know the different layers of me.‚Äù

1jdhdr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1jdhdr7/not_quite_oab/,Not quite OAB,"
I wanted to share my story in case it helps someone going through something similar.

 Last July, I went through an extremely stressful period at work. One day, I rushed to the emergency clinic because I felt the urge to urinate every 10‚Äì20 minutes and thought I had a urinary tract infection.

They took blood and urine samples, but everything came back normal. I was given bladder-specific painkillers, but they didn‚Äôt help at all. I visited a gynecologist to rule out any gynecological issues (like a prolapsed uterus), but everything was fine. Still, I was constantly struggling with the urgent need to urinate and lower abdominal pain.
Then I saw a urologist, had a bladder ultrasound and another urine culture test ‚Äì again, all results were normal. I stopped eating spicy food and cut out coffee completely, but I still felt like I had to pee all the time.
Nights were hard too ‚Äì although I was lucky to get away with just 1‚Äì2 bathroom trips per night, it still disrupted my sleep. For eight months, I lived with a low but persistent pain ‚Äî a steady 2-3 out of 10 on the scale.

 I tried meditation, which helped a little, and went to a kinesiologist who used a TENS device targeting the tibial nerve ‚Äì I noticed some improvement, but the symptoms didn‚Äôt fully go away.

And don‚Äôt laugh ‚Äì at this point, I turned to ChatGPT for help. It came up with a plan to support my body from within: magnesium, pumpkin seed oil, and herbal teas. After just the first cup of tea, I already felt a bit better. After the second cup, I had my first ‚Äúnormal‚Äù day in a long time ‚Äì and things have been steadily improving ever since.

Most likely, my issue was not classic OAB, but rather a combination of sensitive bladder, possibly an irritated bladder wall, mild inflammatory processes, and neural hypersensitivity ‚Äî and for these, the herbal tea was the perfect solution.

The fact that tibial nerve stimulation didn‚Äôt help only reinforces this: this was not purely a neurological dysfunction, but also involved a local bladder condition as part of the picture.

The herbal tea is:
Salus Nieren-Blasen-Tee ‚Äì Key Active Ingredients:
‚Ä¢ 150 mg Hauhechelwurzel ‚Äì Spiny Restharrow Root (mild diuretic, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory effect).
‚Ä¢ 250 mg Goldrutenkraut (echtes) ‚Äì Goldenrod (a classic remedy for bladder and kidney cleansing, anti-inflammatory, supports mucosal regeneration).
‚Ä¢ 200 mg Schachtelhalmkraut ‚Äì Horsetail Herb (excellent muscle relaxant, supports lymphatic circulation, promotes tissue regeneration).
‚Ä¢ 250 mg Birkenbl√§tter ‚Äì Birch Leaves (mild diuretic, supports elimination, cleanses the urinary tract).

I know my journey isn‚Äôt over yet ‚Äî I still have several months of healing ahead, and I‚Äôll have to say goodbye to my four daily coffees for good. But I truly hope the information above helps someone out there, or at least encourages you to give it a try. It‚Äôs an inexpensive remedy, and maybe it‚Äôs something you haven‚Äôt tried yet ‚Äî but it might just make a difference.

Normally, this would annoy me.. But that day I was happy to be up and for the day ahead of us. After we got dressed and ready for the day, we packed up the truck with a big box of clothes we planned on bringing to a consignment shop, and what remained, we were going to take to a thrift store to donate. 

  
At 0930, we arrived at our first stop.. Chick Fila for breakfast. We rarely eat out for breakfast, but Chick Fila has some bomb fast food breakfast items!! Afterwards, we stopped at a gas station to grab a couple Monsters.. I tried a new one (for me), an Irish Creme coffee Monster which I enjoyed. My wife grabbed a Peach Ultra which she really liked, as well!

We stopped at the consignment shop and dropped off our clothes.. My wife told me she hoped we'd make $75 on all of it.. I said I'd be beyond happy with that because I know how these shops work, lol. While we waited for them to go through the clothes, we went next door to a crafting store as my wife LOVES to craft. She bought a couple items, and a couple birthday presents for our loved ones while there. We get the text to come back to the consignment shop.. We do. We made $20.10.. And instead of us being upset, we just could not stop laughing. I told the gal there she could keep the dime. Lol.

  
We then drove a couple towns over to go to their botanical center. We went straight to the butterfly room where they have probably 50(ish) butterflies flying around, with tons of flowers and gorgeous plants. This is where I found out I was scared of butterflies... We took tons of pictures and saw all different pretty colors of butterflies. It wasn't overly crowded so we basically got the room to ourselves! Next, we went to another exhibit which they change seasonally. At this time, it was FILLED with tulips! SO beyond pretty and calming. We saw an orange tree there and of course we had to pose and take pictures with it all! We sat at a table and talked for awhile, saw some other creepy bugs, looked through the gift shop and left for lunch. 

  
We tried a new Greek place which we ended up really liking and we will definitely be going back to! We proceeded to a variety of shops- Pet Smart, Ulta, Old Navy, TJ Maxx. We didn't buy a lot, but we did find a couple things! Some new earrings for my wife, some candies for me, and some new bowls!

  
Last stop of the day before heading home, we went and got our favorite thing ever.. BUBBLE TEA! We try to come to this town often, because they have the best boba here! We drank that on our way home, wife crocheting in the passenger seat next to me.

  
You know those days where everything lines up? The events of the days, how you're feeling mentally and physically, what is going on in your lives.. Everything just happened to be working in our favor that day. I rate it a 10/10 day and wouldn't have changed a thing.

1jdhd3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1jdhd3l/should_i_release_my_shorthand_font_builder_app/,Should I release my shorthand font builder app?,"**TL;DR: I made a tool for designing and using shorthand fonts, but I'm conflicted about releasing it because I hate that it could be used to generate AI training data. I worry it will kill part of the magic of shorthand.**



The long version:



As a pet project, I decided to make a small app for designing shorthand fonts. Here's a preview of what it looks like.



https://i.redd.it/tsczayxs4ape1.gif

You can use it to design, edit, and combine individual characters or phrases to build a complete and robust shorthand system:  


Then you can use that system to convert *any* text into your shorthand:

https://i.redd.it/rpj9n7b02ape1.gif

Making this has been a great joy for me. It has helped me to practice my shorthand (trust me, designing your own shorthand font is a *fantastic* *-* and painful *-* way to learn all the quirks of your chosen system), expand my programming skills (or rather, the skill of making judicious use of AI coding tools), and entertain myself when I'm bored.



I can think of a lot of cool and fun uses for this, including:

* Serving as an open-source repository of shorthand systems that we can all improve and expand together
* Comparing different systems to assess things like size (number of different glyphs), efficiency (ink-to-character ratio), etc.
* Providing a framework for incorporating shorthand fonts into other tools
   * Making flash-cards for reading practice
   * Building an all-purpose dictionary for translating text to shorthand
   * Checking your QOTD work
* Other stuff that you all might come up with



My biggest concern, however, is that a tool like this could be easily used to generate data for training an ""AI"" model to recognize and translate shorthand writing.



The upside of an AI shorthand translator tool? Then you wouldn't have to post on reddit every time you want to figure out what your grandma's secret diary or ancient recipe says.



The downside? It could kill the magic of shorthand.



To me (and I suspect, many of you), one of the most beautiful parts of shorthands *is* how strange, confusing, niche, and cryptic they can be. When I'm at the coffee shop taking notes in shorthand, passers by either think it's Arabic or that I'm having a stroke. When I write in my journal all the unhinged, clinically concerning thoughts that I have (/s), I can rest easy knowing there are probably less than 1000 people on the entire planet who could read it. Shorthand fills that spot in my brain where I'm still just a ten year old kid who wants to spend his summer break making a secret language with his brother so that they can write notes to each other without their parents knowing what they're saying.



An AI shorthand translator could take that away.



Given how niche this area is, it remains one of the very few parts of our world where AI *will absolutely fail* (if you don't believe me, try uploading an image of some shorthand to your favorite AI tool and tell me how it goes). There's not enough training data, and there aren't enough people with the knowledge, time, and willingness to *create* that data. But if I release this tool, we're one step closer to some industrious programmer hacking together a quick little training pipeline that generates text, converts it into various shorthand systems, and teaches a model to translate between them all.



Am I being paranoid? Overly dramatic? Am I withholding something useful from the community on a personal whim?



The last thing I want is to ruin a part of something that we all find beautiful and fun. I do want to share my work, but believe me when I say: I would rather scrap a programming project that I spent months building rather than end up contributing to something that makes our world just a little bit worse.

My little one turns One in the HOT Texas Summer. Our house is not large enough to host all our friends, so we thought about using the local park with a covered pavilion. 

The kicker is, we would do early morning before their first nap to avoid the mid-day Texas heat. We were thinking donuts & coffee and making the theme pajamas, so everyone knows it is SUPER casual, just roll out of bed - basically just a large play date. Is 8:30a too early to start?

ENM seeking someone to connect with or go on occasional dates. Happily married and dating/exploring separately, based in the CITY NAME area.

Really I'm just looking for someone who is reliable and fun to hang out with and who I can plan dates and connect with over some shared interest or activity. I have a good sense of humor, I'm emotionally stable and mature, I have good communication skills, and my favorite part of getting ""old"" is that I'm getting better at knowing and asking for what I want.

I'm happily married to and raising two kids with my nesting partner, so I'm not looking for another primary partner or a larger family (got the snip years ago!), generally cannot host, and realistically can meet up somewhere between once a week to once a month, depending on distance, advance notice, etc. But I don't work a regular 9-5 and often have a lot of flexibility during the day for lunch or coffee get-togethers.

As far as interests go, I like to cook and eat good food (I have celiac and am a pretty good gluten-free chef). I love live music of many kinds and I'm a hobbyist guitar and bass player. I'm an avid runner and enjoy outdoor activities of many kinds -- hiking, kayaking, etc. I also like movies and books (too many to list, but recently enjoyed The Substance and been reading lots of Terry Pratchett), board and video games, and plenty of other indoor activities too (wink wink nudge nudge). I'm pretty much a non-drinker at this point, but do enjoy weed and very occasionally will have a cider or whiskey.

* at what age did your dad take his life? I forgot.

* (me) lil over 30 I guess. \[that was around my age\]

* Umm, did any1 ever speak to u abt being bipolar?

* (me) Ye, plenty, but theyre never acting on anything and I dont rly wanna talk about everything.
* U know what, I think we should try lithium for u.



So here we are. Ive been on lithium since then and got my bp diagnosis not long after, and tbh, Ive never been this stable on any drug. Pre L, once my brain started getting fked up, I always thought Id end up taking my life. But this drug made me feel like I could actually have a chance u know.



In less than a year my side effects were:

Weight gain -> +23 kg

Loss in IQ (trust me) -> -30p at least xD

Acne -> my body is shooting out sebum. And yet, Im dry as a mf regarding hair, skin, lips, mouth. How does the body even come up with this??

Polyury, or like I wrote, w/e its called -> I drink 9 liters of water/day and pee all the time.

Hand tremor -> Sometimes I cant drink without using both hands and I usually spill (its not even sexy commercial style)



and these ones arent even the worst. The worst is: DIARRHEAAA, or as this guy on this forum \[bless u man!!!\] is writing ‚ÄúIve got the shits‚Äù. I have a really hard time working or having a social life with this. Being or feeling like Im fat and ugly, thats secondary, but I really need help with this.



So I change the formula from ‚ÄúLithionit 42mg (6mmol)‚Äù \[Lithium Sulphate\] to ‚ÄúLitiumkarbonat OBA 300 mg (8,1 mmol Li+)‚Äù \[Lithium Carbonate\] and yet its not good enough.

Other things I tried is changing my diet (IBS-diet), worked pre L but not anymore. Now trying IGT for half a year, nobody is asking me if Im pregnant anymore, but the diarrhea is not gone.

Around a week ago I changed coffee for matcha. I try to drink less alcohol but it doesnt help either.

Now Ive lost it completely, and I‚Äôm gonna try something called calamus root, TBD. Clearly I need help.

I am in Canada, looking to build or to get a prebuilt. I have built systems in the past, but this would have been 15-20+ years or so ago. So, I am not up to date on newer builds. Currently have an Alienware Aurora R8 which was a prebuilt with the following specs. Looking at moving towards either a 5070ti or 9070XT build. My budget is max $3000 Cad if I have to buy everything. I am guessing I can scavenge the Storage, but am unsure of parts like the RAM, CPU, power supply, motherboard, liquid cooling... I would like a spacious case, do not care too much for lighting effects.
If parts are not reusable how much of a premium is the Best Buy Canada prebuilt system like this one SLC4600BSDFV3 would I be paying?

Since November, I have been experiencing stomach issues. Occasional constipation relieved by drinking more water and episodic bouts of diarrhea usually an hour or two after eating. I tried to keep a food diary on which foods trigger it and it's mainly coffee, greasy food or food with lactose. Sometimes I can eat those foods with no issue. But the episodes seem to be growing closer and now I have more frequent gas pain. I was diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis in November with joint damage in my wrist because I let the pain go on too long thinking it was a RSI or carpal tunnel. I've always had a sensitive stomach, but I've been acutely aware of all my symptoms since that experience last year. I don't want to brush it off again.

I will say I have extreme health anxiety, especially since Nov and have had frequent panic attacks over my stomach. I do not have any red flags symptoms like blood in the stool, weight loss, extreme abdominal pain or fatigue (if anything, I'm more alert than usual). I had bloodwork done in December 2023 (CBC, CMP, thyroid panel) and everything was normal except for a high hs-CRP, which I don't know if it's related to the arthritis.  When I have to go to the bathroom, there's no pain, just urgency. 

  
I do have a doc appointment next week and I will bring up my concerns but I am worried over the change in bowel habits. I know persistent diarrhea can mean many things, but I guess the increase of CC in under 50s is scaring me. I don't want to be dismissed because of my anxiety but at the same time, I need some reassurance while I wait for the appropriate tests. Thank you.",1,1742229490.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1jdh1k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jdh1k8/the_message_was_not_meant_for_you/,The Message Was Not Meant for You,"Most days, I worked from home while my young daughter watched television. At least, that‚Äôs what I thought was happening.

At three years old, my daughter was obsessed with the nursery songs every child loves: Baa Baa, Black Sheep, The Wheels on the Bus, Incy Wincy Spider. My wife and I encouraged it, believing it helped her develop language and musical appreciation. We couldn't, however, always be present for her, and there were options to entertain our daughter through the television. I'm not proud of it, but I saw that the TV provided ample cause for her to focus on the jingle jangle of a Humpty Dumpty, leaving me to focus on my work. Whilst we were by no means poor, a nanny was out of the question, and grandparents were either deceased or lived far away. As such, television played a significant role during weekdays.

For several years, my working life hummed along to the songs of juvenile rhyme. Childish ditties haunted my professional acts. Everything seemed normal, and my daughter developed her faculties at an expected rate. This is all very mundane and predictable at this point. You might wonder why I would relate this to you. I want to clarify that before I go into the marrow of this matter, I am, or at least was, of sound mind and judgment. But there was one day when it all changed. The day the voice spoke.

One afternoon, my typing joined the cartoon wail of the television. I won't go into what this work involves - it doesn't matter, and I don't want to risk identifying myself by any means. Whilst my daughter watched the glowing television screen, I heard something I never expected - among the din of the childish tunes emanating from the TV. The voice announced itself. At first, I thought it might have been something I misheard. My attention was on my work, not the colourful chaos flashing on the screen. I ignored it - promptly consigning it to the realm of brief mental phantasms which increasingly plagued me as I grew older. My ageing limbic system struck by lightning limbo.

Then it happened again. I heard it. With my ears. It wasn't just in my head. The grit of the words. The contours. I took it in‚Äîthe voice.

I WILL SHOW YOU SHAPES YOU HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED.

What does that mean? Nonsense. You're tired. Take a nap if you need to, I thought.

I WILL SHOW YOU SHAPES YOU HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED.

There it was again. I heard it. It was deeper than any bass singer‚Äîbelow the register altogether. I couldn't place an accent. It was accentless in the most profound sense. The sound of the voice conformed perfectly with its meaning. No human geography could link to this voice. The meaning dictated the sound and the sound dictated the meaning. Perfect unison of sign and signifier. No mediation. Meaning in itself. I tilted my head towards the sound's source - the television with my young daughter seated before it. Multi-coloured shapes fluttered by - an animal, a donkey, expanded to fill the screen. ""Eeyore!"" it squealed - nothing out of the ordinary.

The sun grew warmer. I made progress in my tasks. I cooked lunch for the two of us, and she ate much of what I cooked. An ideal midday ensued. All the while, the television blared out the pedestrian classics of infancy. My daughter looked a little sleepy. Nap time?

And then, uninvited as before, it repeated its declaration.

I WILL SHOW YOU SHAPES YOU HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED.

It became persistent and the tone more direct. More confident. A little more normal, but there was something off about it. It wasn't human. It was wrong. What were these shapes, and why would I ""consider"" them?

CONSIDER THIS.

CONSIDER THIS.

CONSIDER THIS.

My head rumbled as my eyes darted to the keyboard. It wasn't right anymore. The QWERTY order was misaligned, or at least it was different to how I remembered it. The letters on the keys were wrong. Shifted‚Äîre-written in a language that didn't quite make sense. The contour of my hand against the backdrop of the keyboard softened. Faded.

My hand,

the keys,

my khand,

To be the plastic keys.

To be pressed and caressed by my fingers.

To be the tool and the operator.

It made sense. The only sense. The only way. Then it shifted out of the way. So absurd. Cold, standing at the interstitial web between sleep and waking life. Sense became an absurdity. Logical order resumed. It was fine again. Everything in place. As I had always known it.

A shot of recognition. My eyes bulged and I scanned the room, pulling the muscles in my neck. My heart pounded. My daughter was gone.

Then I remembered, or at least thought, that I had put her to nap. Was it true? I clambered up the stairs to her room to find a sleeping babe.

Relief.

At first, I told myself it had never happened. I even laughed at the absurdity of it‚Äîthe voice, the shifting letters, becoming the keys, the creeping dread. It was ridiculous‚Äîa combination of overwork and stimulants. I even considered speaking to a doctor. Maybe even my wife if I got desperate. No. That would make it too real.

But sometimes, when I sat down to type, my fingers hesitated over the keyboard. Sometimes, I turned off the television, only to find it still humming, the screen black but somehow alive. Sometimes, my daughter would sing her nursery rhymes just a little too slowly, stretching the words like toffee, as if she were testing them on her tongue.

But nothing happened. Not really. Nothing I couldn't explain.

But.

But.

But I knew it never left. As much as I wanted to think. To think that it wasn't real. To believe in the mundane. My wife. My daughter. My family. My job. My salary. My bills. The world was a box. Little more. Stick figures hitting each other. Cause and effect. But it would return. I knew it would. All that time. Time. Waiting.

It did.

I SHOWED YOU THE SHAPES.

DID YOU CONSIDER?

I waited for it to leave. Wash over me. A misfiring brain concocting spectral delusions. Perhaps this was the early onset of some cruel disorder that would paralyse me in the years to come.

But I had to think of it. The message. To consider. What could I possibly consider? I was at a loss for the absurdity. Just as I was months ago. Then I thought I had buried it. That it never happened. False memory. Imagination.

This was the recognition. The Second Act. Confirmation of the real. It was the story.

I WILL SQUARE YOUR CIRCLE.

The words struck something in me that I didn't know existed. In primal space. Like hearing a song from a dream you forgot. Like recognising a face in a crowd when you know it‚Äôs impossible. My breath caught, my fingers clenched, my body recoiled‚Äîbut why?

What did it mean?

No, no, no, you won't do that. No squaring circles or circling squares with me.

I WILL SQUARE YOUR CIRCLE.

I WILL SHOW YOU.

SHAPES.

YOU HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED.

I've considered a lot of things. I've considered your creepy voice. I've considered that maybe I shouldn't have experimented with those plants back in the day. I've considered that thinking about this will send me to the looney bin. Off to bedlam. A broken brain. That's what this is. Short-circuiting neurons sparking new-wrongs.

YOU WILL CONSIDER.

THE SHAPES.

REMEMBER.

THE SHAPES.

SQUARE.

CIRCLES.

No. You can't.

It's too much.

Don't break me down...

My body folded like a satin curtain dropped into a wash basket.  


YOU WILL TREMBLE AND DISASSEMBLE.

I WILL CLEAN YOU.

NOW.

ARISE.  


I blinked.

The air smelled of coffee.

I was in the kitchen.

Steam rose from the countertop as the dispenser let off a scream announcing the arrival of boiled water. I picked up the cup, guided a spoon to mix and sipped. That's it. No sugar, or milk. No additives. I drink coffee for utility, not pleasure. Just wake me up and get me going.

The house was silent. We lived on a cul-de-sac a while away from busy roads. My wife had already left for her office; my daughter slumbered. Shadows of the past night pricked the edge of my vision. The brightest darkness. Dark lightning.

I sat at the dining room table, a makeshift office these past few years, much to my wife's displeasure. Two laptops, paper printouts, and books sat where plates, knives and forks would be. On weekends, I‚Äôd clear the workday ephemera and let the table rest. I'd sit here with my first coffee, Monday through Friday, before my daughter would inevitably stir in bed, wake and declare her consciousness to the world.

Something wasn't right. A tick in my skull burrowed deeper. The kind of mental *peck* that accompanies me when I stroll a supermarket knowing I have forgotten something.

I rose from the table, walked towards the television and considered my frosted outline upon the onyx-black screen. I was conscious of the silence again.

The edges of the television caught my attention. There was something unfamiliar about the material surrounding the glass. Was it leather? I put my hand out to caress it. I felt something akin to scales. Had I missed this before? These strange details hidden in plain sight.

And moisture.

And movement.

No, it couldn't be.

Breathing?

A droning buzz reverberated in my skull, the sound warped as though I rose from a great pool of liquid. And then another sound cut like the sharpest knife into my eardrum.

It was the doorbell.

I turned around and walked to the front hallway. Through the frosted glass of the front door, a figure stood stone-still. I wasn't expecting anyone. It was a nice neighbourhood, and I wouldn't normally be wary of such a call at the door, but I felt I had to approach this visitor cautiously. I slowly unlatched the door, opened it by a couple of inches and peeped out.

The man stood there. I could swear he was already smiling, or was it grimacing before I opened the door?

""Sir, I‚Äôm here to see your television.""

""My television?""

""Your television,"" he repeated.

""I don't think you've got the right house.""

The man‚Äôs smile widened.

""Oh, it's the right house. Your wife told us about the problem.""

""My wife told you about problems with the TV?""

""Yes. Did you consider them?""

I swallowed. ""Consider what?""

""The shapes.""

Something shifted behind me. A feeling, not a sound.

And then‚Äîjust beneath my breath, barely audible‚ÄîI heard it.



I WILL SHOW YOU SHAPES YOU HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED.



The man's eyes flicked past me. Over my shoulder. Towards the television.

""It‚Äôs best,"" he murmured, ""not to keep them waiting.""

I looked the man up and down. He wore a blue workman's suit with a toolbelt slung around his waist. A dark silver baseball cap sat on his head, its brim oddly flat. His face was ashen white. His large, dark eyes sank into deep sockets. His accent was faintly Eastern European, Balkans perhaps. Romanian, or Bulgarian, maybe. Very difficult to place.

His mouth tightened, stretching his grimace even wider. A wave of warmth washed over me, like the certainty of something long forgotten. A certainty that he belonged here, though I had no reason to believe it.

I heard my voice before I could stop it. My lips parted on their own. ""Well... you'd better come in.""

With a nod, the man stepped inside, his movements staccato. His arms and legs jolted as he walked, as though he forgot and remembered how to walk from one instance to the next.

I followed him as he approached the television. His jolting hand swiftly reached to his belt and he took something from it that I couldn't make out. He held the item in his hand and pointed it at the television, which emitted an ear-piercing screech causing me to clutch my ears.

At the top of the television, a black proboscis arose from within. Was this some new voice control feature? I never saw that in the manual. The man stepped closer and proceeded to place his mouth on the appendage. The sound of a whistle filled the room as he held it in his mouth. On the screen appeared a snow effect of rainbow-coloured words that looked somehow fÃµÕÜÃäÃÑÃ´ÕöaÃ∏ÕÜÃÑÃõÕàÃπÃômÃ∑ÕíÕëÃ¶iÃ∂ÕõÕÅÕöÃ°Ã≠lÃ¥ÃâÃ†ÃóiÃ¥ÕëÃ¨aÃµÃøÃãÃ©rÃ¥Õ†Ã§ÃØ. The whistling sound grew in intensity and I clutched my ears ever tighter. The room trembled under the weight of the sound, like a billion angels keening in a dying heaven.

Then. Silence. I lowered my arms which by this point were wrapped around my head, so shattering was the sound. The visitor had removed his mouth from the object. I felt a great escape of putrid air from the room, like a window opened in a place forgotten for decades. He turned 90 degrees to his left, paused, and then another 90 degrees to face me, revealing his ceaseless grimace.

""This message was not meant for you. Please accept our apologies.""

A message? Our apologies? My eyes met the deep-set pools of blackness in the visitor's eyes. I couldn't say a word. What could one say to a series of absurdities such as these?

Then, another voice. Behind me. A woman.

""Darling I'm so sorry. It wasn't meant to happen like this.""

It was the voice of \*\*\*\*\*, my wife.

I turned to face my wife and saw my daughter standing beside her, all three feet of her stood perfectly straight, her little eyes glaring into mine, her mouth solemn.

""This was a big mistake, dear. You've received messages that were for us.""

She sighed.

""There's no use explaining it because you just wouldn't understand. Everything is compromised. We're ending this.""

Then my wife froze, moved, and froze again, like a fast wound video tape brought to a sudden standstill.

I winced, feeling an icy touch on my shoulder. I turned and found the man standing not three inches from my face, his eyes now metallic silver.

""The television is fixed, sir. But you are broken, and I must fix you.""

And just like that, I found myself in the surroundings of this prison. The doctors tell me they will make me better. They say that I've suffered a breakdown. That I've invented everything about my supposed life. When I ask them about myself, they won't tell me. They say it's important that I recover my true memories myself. But yet there's nothing else but the life I've lived. I am that person, I'm sure of it, or at least I was.

I am kept confined in my ward. There are no other patients here. No windows. No clocks. No time. I've given up on figuring this out. I just imagine movement. Transitioning. I gaze at the brilliant white walls. Place my hands in front of them. Feel their cold stones. Shapes twisted. Blur the boundary.

The metal room filled with a screeching echo. The cell door opened slowly. Nobody was there, but darkness beyond.

A voice.

""You will proceed.""

I found myself drawn to the door - my legs moving my stiff body towards it.

A familiar form emerged from the darkness. The blankest of faces. The perpetual smirk. The one who said he fixed my television. He was in a white coat, like a doctor, but the peculiarly flat silver baseball cap remained. Incongruous.

""We have sufficiently rotated the shapes. This was an unfortunate interlude.""

He stood still, that ceaseless grin painted on his face.

My breath punctuated the silence. Did he expect me to respond to that? Questions were difficult to muster, let alone answers. I felt my eyes squinting.

""Do I get an explanation?""

The being looked up like he was seeking the guidance of an invisible creature above us.

""No. The message was not meant for you. You will proceed as planned. There will be no more disturbances. We guarantee it. Enjoy the rest of your journey.""

Behind the being, my wife and daughter emerged from the dark, also dressed in lab coats. I'd never seen such a tiny coat of that kind on a young child.

""It isn't authorised to tell you anything, other than the bare minimum.""

My mouth gaped - it was my toddler daughter speaking like an intelligent adult.

""You will only barely recall this. You play a minor, but important part in a mission that I, and the being you know as your wife, are undertaking.""

I held my fingers to my cheeks, pinching them. Get me out of this lucid nightmare, I thought, but rather than ejection into the real, I felt a sting pulse my face.

""An eÃ∑ÃøÕêÃóÃºÃπnÃµÕíÕùÃßeÃ∏ÕëÕòÃÆmÃµÃöÕóÕÑÃ¢yÃµÃöÃôÃº fÃ∂rÃ∂iÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂ enemy interrupted the project. Several shapes were knocked out of line. It attempted to communicate with you. Its message was disruptive. It is a liar.""

I felt a great weight lift from my body, my arms rose like balloons and the room filled with the purest white light.

Super itchy red skin that would eventually dry out and leave a scar. (Does this happen to anyone else?) Only once, have two of the spots developed into cold sores. Once they did, I convinced my Dr. to put me on 1000mg of Valtrex 2x/day. 

Since, I‚Äôve been trying to better understand my triggers. One that I definitely confirmed a couple days ago was after taking fluconazole for a yeast infection. Apparently it‚Äôs a common trigger for many. Confirming this makes me question if this is how it all started. I constantly get yeast infections and since about two years ago, I started frequently taking fluconazole every time I had YI symptoms. Did this trigger the beginning of never ending rash/coldsore outbreaks? 

I‚Äôm not sure, but I‚Äôve been on Valtrex for six months now and still occasionally get these OB whenever I miss a dose. Now, I‚Äôm afraid to get off off Valtrex because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll keep getting them despite not taking fluconazole. 

I don‚Äôt know guys. I feel so defeated sometimes. I‚Äôm very healthy, sleep well, exercise, extremely clean (extra clean and careful during OB), clean meals, take vitamins. No chocolate, no coffee, no caffeine, no sweets, no nuts/seeds, alcohol once every blue moon. Don‚Äôt feel stressed. Supper supportive partner and family. I don‚Äôt even like to cry that much anymore during OB‚Äôs and rather give them little to no attention because I don‚Äôt want to feed them with ‚Äústress‚Äù. 

Is it even safe to take Valtrex for cold sores for so long? Anyone else been on it for years? Do you ever get off it? Did you get cold sores after getting off it? 

Please tell me someone can relate. Thanks for reading.

I'm a hobbyist photographer and writer and it's been a lifelong dream of mine to create my own book. After travelling extensively through Japan, I wanted to make a travel/photography book (especially across my adventures in Japan) to achieve my dream and to maybe share it with friends and family. I'm not sure if I'll have anything good for the market, but I'm focusing on writing and publishing for myself for the time being (baby steps!)

I've also been a longtime fan of the publishing company, Taschen. Their *Project Japan: Metabolism Talks* has been one of my all-time favourite books, and I've been an avid collector since I've been introduced to them in university.

Although I'm used to writing and photographing, creating a book has been a daunting challenge. All I have is a rough draft of the book on Pages and an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription for InDesign. I'm not even sure where to start (InDesign is overwhelming as a newbie!)

Would Taschen also use InDesign? What size would be appropriate for a larger coffee-table book? (I'd also appreciate any recommendations to other subreddits that might be able to give more guidance.)",1,1742229135.0,publishing,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been brewing for a while ‚Äî V60, cold brew, espresso ‚Äî but I never thought much of it until now.

Lately, I came across a pretty good deal on¬†*Espresso Coffee Shop*¬†for the Rocket Appartamento. Even with shipping, it‚Äôs a lot cheaper than buying it firsthand here. And now, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

I currently use my trusty Gaggia Classic with the switch buttons. Got it secondhand in 2021 (I'm not surprised if its around 7 years old now), and I still love the shots it pulls. Honestly, I‚Äôve grown pretty attached to it (lol, but I‚Äôm okay with moving on). The only thing is‚Ä¶ the steam wand is kind of gross ‚Äî milk hardens into the crevices, and it‚Äôs a pain to clean. Plus, the heat-up time and steam power discourage me from offering people hot milk drinks.

So, here I am, staring at the Rocket Appartamento and wondering:

* For those who upgraded, do you have any thoughts?
* Do you regret it?
* Do you love it?

I‚Äôm currently using a Sette 270 for grinding espresso, and it‚Äôs been great. Just wondering if the Appartamento would be a worthy upgrade. I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences.

However the other day the car was having a hard time starting, then the next day left me stranded a few towns over. Luckily I had bought a few spare DME relays, so before I called AAA I popped one in to see if that was the problem and the car fired right up. 

I thought I was in the clear, and that the old relay had just broken down over its lifespan (I don't know how old it was, as it was in the fuse box when I bought the car) but today I couldn't start the car either after driving around for a bit and stopping for some coffee. Again, I had one more spare relay and put it in to get to work.

From reading [84' 944-No start until pull/replace DME Relay - Pelican Parts Forums ](https://forums.pelicanparts.com/porsche-924-944-968-technical-forum/1138290-84-944-no-start-until-pull-replace-dme-relay.html)it seems like excess heat could be the problem. I know these relays can start to work again when cooled down, but I haven't tried plugging in either of the ""spent"" relays back in to see if they'll work.  Is this problem of going through relays quickly caused by a short in the wiring? Anyone have success using the F9 solid state DMEs with the LEDs to diagnose their problem? I have an appointment with a mechanic for another issue on Wednesday if it's something that I can't take care of.

We have dated and are in a relationship for 6 months thus far. I‚Äôve noticed she‚Äôs wierd with her phone or shall I say overprotective since day 1. I can‚Äôt go on it or even holding it would be an issue, she says for privacy reasons which is fair enough. I noticed one day she was on Snapchat messaging someone and when I walked into the room, she closed the conversation immediately and was all nervous.

I confronted her and asked who she‚Äôs talking to and she said ‚Äúits a group chat.‚Äù Which im aware group chats are purple not blue, which was a lie. I stared at her and she stood up and goes you‚Äôre making me uncomfortable. The next day she was snooping my phone while texting and I angled the phone away and pulled it away from her face and she exploded saying ‚Äúoh you can do that but I can‚Äôt.‚Äù I told her too bad. 

After that I told her we can sit down and have a transparent conversation about what happened, when we did she avoided the texts and wanting to talk, she ignored me for 5 hours. We finally sat down after she was home alone and her parents and family were on vacation. I told her how that snapchat conversation made me uncomfortable and she insisted it was a group chat. We talked more and seemed to be on better terms, but I told her if another thing happens, she will findout the hard way. Her biggest fear is me dumping her or leaving.

Later that day I noticed this grin or smirk on her face, I have never seen something like this. I can‚Äôt even try to do it with my face but it was like stuck on her face. I asked her if she was okay and she seemed in a daze. The next day we woke up and were supposed to go to the beach but it was raining. 

Suddenly around 12:30 she insisted I should go home and she needs time to herself and to let the dog to roam the house, he‚Äôs extremely aggressive the dog. I sat there and asked her whats the rush and she started rolling her eyes. She grabbed my clothing bag and put it in the closet, like cleaning up the house in a rush. I asked again whats the rush and she got impatient.

So I left and came back around 5pm. I noticed when I came back in, her face was bright red and flushed. That grin was on her face again and when I went to hug and kiss her, she pulled her face away immediately. I asked her whats wrong? And she said she‚Äôs fine, while sitting on the couch she started flushing all over, her face, ears, and neck were bright red. When we walked downstairs to her bedroom she immediately started shaking and became all nervous, and stuttering. I asked her whats wrong and she was full of anxiety, without any explanation. 

I didn‚Äôt notice anything out of the ordinary in the room or anything on her, but I was sketched out. She did send a snapchat earlier that she went to starbucks for a coffee after I left and she left the house.

I dumped her later that night after her friends came over. I asked her whats wrong with her being all anxious and she says ‚ÄúI swear im okay‚Ä¶ I promise.‚Äù

Am I overreacting? I felt like she left the house and cheated.

So I broke up with my boyfriend after a year together back in jan. He took 9 months to tell his family about me, and 10 to ask me to actually be his girlfriend, however by this point, we were certainly together. He was going out with other girls for coffee but didn‚Äôt see the issue with not telling me for months. He also accused me of cheating as I turned my location off, however I did this as i got incredibly sick, not being able to walk so was going nowhere. He would text me saying a girl won‚Äôt stop texting him but never actually told them he was seeing someone, despite me encouraging him to say that. The list goes on, so needless to say I broke up with him (even though he couldn‚Äôt understand why). I got back together with him a month or so later as I felt I didn‚Äôt give him a chance. I explained my feelings and he said he loved to hear where he went wrong and that i should have said earlier (as if communication was the issue‚Ä¶). First week back was great. I got flowers from him for the first time, and it seemed better UNTIL he said the reason I broke up with him must have been because me and my family were jealous of his achievements! He was making it very clear that he did not know what my issues were, and couldn‚Äôt see a problem with his behaviour, despite him seeming pretty coherent when we rekindled. He also turned everyone against me after the first breakup, but then said it‚Äôs my problem what people think of me. My final straw was him asking me how much my rates were, got up and threw ¬£300 of cash at me whilst I was on the bed, albeit doing it jokingly and I went along with it. I just don‚Äôt think this is something one should do whilst trying again with the relationship. I ended things a few days ago as it just wasn‚Äôt working. Aside from all that, we had a fun relationship! I feel as if I didn‚Äôt really express my feelings enough in the relationship, and maybe instead of ending things, I should have said more of how I felt?

even worse the set of two tanks the buyer is talking about were brand new!!!!!!!

also, this was a bundled order and all I had available to pack this in was a box because of the capacity of it.

not bashing this person if there was actually a stain that I somehow missed but geez, a one star review?

just kind of sucks üòî do i message the buyer or leave it?

I‚Äôm super excited to join this incredible university and start this next chapter. 

Are there any fellow future Huskers joining in Fall 2025? 

Or current students who want to give me some survival tips? üòÖ 

Let‚Äôs connect! I‚Äôm all about making new friends and finding out where the best coffee spots are on campus (we all know that‚Äôs crucial). 

Can‚Äôt wait to see what UNL has in store!

The bars in that snippet alone are just hard as bricks lmao    Anyways, when the show got to ‚ÄúHumble‚Äù I was thinking about when they were creating the set list and thinking about crowd reaction and how dope it is that everyone knows what song is starting the second you hear the two consecutive guitar strums at the beginning of humble and I also thought it was funny that Kendrick knew everyone was waiting for him to say the word ‚Äúspiral‚Äù and he chose not to, instead had everyone else do it for him while he takes a breathe haha     fast forward a couple of tracks and I‚Äôm still thinking about the set list build and I caught something in ‚ÄúEuphoria‚Äù right when the beat kicks in at the ‚ÄúBenjamin and a Jackson‚Äù bar, bro those bells are wayyy louder than I remember before! I went back and relistened to the single, rewatched euphoria at the pop out, it‚Äôs there, but it‚Äôs not the same. I actually thought back to the j. Cole track ‚Äúfor whom the bells toll‚Äù and I know there‚Äôs a Metallica track with the same name but never really listened to it so I googled the meaning and was left kind of speechless lol for someone who makes moves that seem so calculated, it feels like it has to be intentional, and also, on that stage, in red white and blue? There‚Äôs an obvious reach towards the liberty bell there and then that makes me feel like the bells toll for whomever they may apply. Maybe I‚Äôm trippin, maybe I just need some coffee haha but I gotta get to work now, thanks for coming to my ted talk ‚úåÔ∏è ",2,1742228157.0,KendrickLamar,0,0.67,False
