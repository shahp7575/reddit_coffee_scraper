The first time we met again, ⏳
he fired me in front of everyone. 🥀
Five years ago, I carried his child. 🤰
-----------------------------------
Chapter 1
Isla

They say ghosts don’t exist, but they’ve never been blindsided by one in a designer suit and Italian leather shoes.

I was running late for the Monday morning meeting—half-asleep, clutching my lukewarm coffee, and praying no one noticed the stain on my blouse from Leo’s jelly toast attack. I slid into my chair just as our CEO, Mike, cleared his throat.

“We have a new majority shareholder,” he began, eyes darting nervously around the boardroom. “He’ll be overseeing operations personally. Please give a warm welcome to—”

The door opened. I looked up. And my heart stopped.

He stepped into the room like he owned it—which, technically, he now did.

Lucien Wolfe.

Only I didn’t know him as that. Not five years ago. Back then, I only knew him as Luke—the man who kissed me under a Tuscan sunset, who made me laugh like I hadn’t in years, who vanished without warning and took my heart with him.

The same man who had no idea he left me with something far more permanent than heartbreak.

I gripped the edge of the conference table, my nails biting into the wood. He looked different—taller somehow, broader, sharper around the edges. His dark hair was slicked back now, his jaw tighter, his expression like chiseled ice.

But his eyes.

God, those eyes.

Grey. Cold. Calculating.

And still the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.

He scanned the room with all the warmth of a panther selecting prey. And then—he saw me.

Our eyes locked. A flicker of something crossed his face—confusion, maybe? Recognition? But it vanished before I could name it.

“Thank you, Mike,” Lucien said smoothly, his voice deeper than I remembered. “I’m not here to shake things up… yet. I’m just observing. Continue.”

He sat at the head of the table, precisely where he belonged. Alpha. Untouchable.

I couldn’t breathe.

My mind screamed. Does he remember me? But he didn’t say a word. Didn’t falter. Didn’t even blink.

I forced myself to sit still through the rest of the meeting, though I heard none of it. The walls felt like they were closing in. The room was too hot, too bright. Or maybe that was just my panic setting in.

The moment Mike dismissed us, I bolted—too fast, too obvious, but I didn’t care.

I made it to the hallway, half-jogging toward the elevator, willing the doors to open faster.

“Isla.”

I froze.

His voice was behind me—quiet, commanding, impossible to ignore.

Slowly, I turned. Lucien stood just a few feet away, hands in his pockets, watching me like he was trying to place a dream from a lifetime ago.

“You look… familiar,” he said, head tilting slightly. “Have we met?”

I swallowed. “I—I don’t think so.”

He studied me longer, and I felt like I was being dissected under a microscope. “You sure?”

“Positive,” I lied.

He stepped closer. Not threatening. Not unkind. Just… intense. “Hmm. Maybe I’m mistaken.”

You are. Please be mistaken. Please walk away.

But he didn’t. “What’s your name?”

I hesitated. “Isla. Isla Monroe.”

He said it quietly, testing the sound of it on his tongue. “Isla.”

The elevator chimed. I turned and stepped inside, desperate for escape.

As the doors closed, I met his gaze one last time.

Those eyes. That face. That past I’d buried deep.

And the secret I had never told a soul.

I made it to the bathroom before I broke.

Locking myself in the furthest stall, I sat down and pressed a hand to my mouth to muffle the sob that escaped.

Lucien Wolfe. Billionaire. CEO. Tech titan. My son’s father.

How was this happening?

Five years. I’d told myself a thousand times I would never see him again. That what we had was just a summer illusion. That he probably wasn’t even real.

But now he was here. Flesh and blood. Standing in my office.

And I had a son with his eyes and no idea how to fix this.

That night, I tucked Leo into bed and sat beside him as he drifted to sleep. His tiny hand clutched my fingers, his lashes long and dark against his cheeks. He was the only good thing that had come from that heartbreak.

He didn’t know who his father was. I’d never spoken his name. How could I, when I didn’t know who Lucien Wolfe really was until recently—until his face started popping up in Forbes articles and tech magazines?

I’d thought about reaching out. A hundred times. A thousand.

But how do you explain to the richest man in the country that you had his child and never told him?

And how do you admit that you were scared? That you didn’t know if he’d want the baby, or hate you for keeping it?

Now the choice was being ripped from my hands.

He was here.

And the past I’d worked so hard to bury was clawing its way to the surface.

Chapter 2
Lucien

She looked at me like I was a ghost.

It wasn’t the usual reaction I got when walking into a room—fear, awe, admiration, maybe a hint of jealousy. People read the name Lucien Wolfe and either scrambled to impress or to hide. I was used to being the one in control, the one others studied like a predator in the wild. But this… this was different.

Her expression hit me like a cold wave—eyes wide, skin pale, breath caught in her throat.

And for the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why.

Isla Monroe.

The name lingered in my mind long after the meeting ended. Her voice echoed too—soft, poised, but trembling at the edges, like she was trying to hold herself together. I knew I’d seen her before. Not in a vague, have we met at some gala? kind of way. No, this was different. She struck something deep, something old. Like a song you haven’t heard in years that still makes your chest tighten, even if you don’t remember the lyrics.

But I couldn’t place her. And that infuriated me.

I’d spent years sharpening my instincts, reading people in seconds, uncovering lies with a glance. I could dissect a man’s life from his handshake alone. Yet the moment I looked into her eyes, all of that precision slipped. It felt like standing on the edge of a memory I wasn’t allowed to access.

Familiar. That’s what she was.

Too familiar.

I stood at the window of my penthouse hours later, the city skyline stretched before me like a conquest. The glass walls framed a world I’d carved out with my own hands—skyscrapers that bore my mark, a legacy that had no room for fragility or emotion.

But tonight, I wasn’t thinking about stock prices or acquisition deals. I was thinking about her.

That look on her face. The way she flinched when I said her name.

Isla.

There was something in the way her lips moved. A memory that wouldn’t form completely. A moment just out of reach. I closed my eyes, trying to force clarity.

And then it came. Italy.

My hand tightened around the crystal tumbler of scotch. It had been five years, but suddenly, that summer came back in sharp flashes. A quiet village outside Florence. The smell of lemons and dust. A woman with sun-kissed skin and laughter in her voice. I’d gone by Luke then. My middle name. Trying to escape my life, my name, the headlines. A sabbatical of sorts—except no one really escapes who they are.

And her.

The girl who never asked who I really was. She didn’t care about Wolfe Capital or my last name. She just saw me. Luke, the man who painted awful watercolors and burned pasta. The man who held her under the stars and kissed her like the world was ending.

Could it be…?

No. It couldn’t be.

But the timelines matched. Her reaction matched. The way she looked at me—like I’d shattered her.

And her eyes… God, they were the same ones I remembered looking up at me beneath a Tuscan sky. I’d buried that summer under layers of ambition and steel. I told myself it didn’t mean anything, that it was just a break in the storm.

But it had meant something.

And now I couldn’t ignore the question gnawing at me.

I set the glass down with a sharp click and pulled up her employee file on my tablet. Legal consultant. Hired three years ago. Good reputation. Met deadlines. Clean record. No red flags.

Except there was a gap.

A full year missing.

Maternity leave?

The thought hit me like a brick to the chest. My jaw clenched. I opened a deeper background search—something the standard HR system wouldn’t show. Isla Monroe. Age 29. Born in Seattle. Moved to New York six years ago. One dependent.

Leo Monroe. Age four.

Born nine months after that summer.

I stared at the screen, unmoving. My throat dried. My ears rang like I’d been thrown into the ocean. The facts were lining up too neatly. Too painfully.

A son?

My son?

No. I was jumping to conclusions. Assumptions. Dangerous ones.

I needed proof. I needed truth. Because if she lied—if she kept my child from me—then this wasn’t just betrayal. It was war.

I leaned against the desk, trying to breathe through the storm of thoughts crashing through my head. Four years. She’d known for four years and said nothing. What kind of woman does that? What kind of mother?

And yet… part of me wasn’t angry.

Part of me was gutted.

Because I hadn’t known. I hadn’t been there for his first steps, his first words. I hadn’t even known his name until tonight.

I picked up the phone.

“Darren,” I said, my voice low and clipped. “I need a quiet DNA test run. Fast. Get me something off Isla Monroe. Coffee cup, pen, anything she’s touched.”

There was a pause. “You think she—?”

“Just do it,” I snapped.

I ended the call and paced the room for what felt like hours. The scotch sat untouched. My phone buzzed with updates I ignored. None of it mattered right now. Not until I knew.

That evening, I found myself parked outside her apartment building. I hadn’t planned it. I told myself I was just in the area. That I needed air. But I didn’t move. I stayed. Watched.

She emerged just after six, bundled in a long coat, scarf wrapped tight around her neck. Her hair was tucked beneath a wool cap, and in her hand was a much smaller one—chubby fingers, a navy-blue mitten, a little boy no taller than her hip.

He laughed as they walked. Bright, wild, unfiltered joy. The kind I hadn’t felt in years.

And then—just for a second—he turned his head.

Our eyes met.

Grey.

Not maybe grey. Not sort-of grey.

My grey.

My mouth went dry. My chest caved in.

He looked just like me. Same bone structure. Same smirk. Same damned eyes.

I couldn’t breathe.

She hadn’t told me. She’d gone on with her life, raised a child who carried my blood, my legacy—without me.

He was mine.

And I’d missed everything.

Chapter 3
Isla

The first sign that something was wrong came when I opened my fridge and found Leo’s juice box missing.

Not a big deal on its own—he’s four and fast when he wants to be—but the second sign came a heartbeat later. My phone buzzed on the counter with a calendar notification I didn’t set. A meeting. Noon. Private conference – Lucien Wolfe’s office.

I hadn’t agreed to any meeting.

I stared at the screen, heart thudding. A chill slid down my spine.

This wasn’t a coincidence. Not after yesterday. Not after the look he gave me.

He knows something.

I tried to shake it off as I dressed for work, but the thought stayed rooted in my skull. I kissed Leo’s forehead before dropping him off at daycare, and the entire time he talked about dinosaurs and cookies, I felt like a bomb was ticking somewhere under my feet.

The office felt colder today. Or maybe that was just me.

Whispers followed me down the hallway. A few glances. Nothing out of the ordinary, but it felt like everyone knew. Like I’d grown a scarlet letter overnight.

I didn’t have time to think about it. At 11:58, my nerves completely unraveled.

I stood outside Lucien Wolfe’s office, staring at the massive glass doors like they might swallow me whole.

You’ve survived worse, I told myself.

That was a lie.

I knocked once, then pushed the door open.

Lucien was behind his desk, sleeves rolled up, suit jacket draped over the chair. He looked up—and everything in him went still.

“So you did come.”

I swallowed hard. “You sent a meeting invite.”

His eyes flickered. “You didn’t decline.”

I walked in cautiously, arms folded tight across my chest. “What is this about?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he reached into a drawer and pulled out a manila envelope. My stomach twisted.

“I don’t like being lied to, Isla.”

He slid the envelope across the desk.

I didn’t open it. I didn’t have to.

“I want to hear it from you,” he said softly, but there was steel under the words. “Is he mine?”

The air left my lungs.

My legs gave out, and I sat without meaning to, sinking into the leather chair opposite him. I stared at the envelope. At the name scrawled on the tab in neat handwriting.

Leo Monroe.

I looked up slowly, my voice a whisper. “You had me followed?”

“No,” he said. “I had you investigated.”

The distinction barely mattered.

I should have been angry. Maybe I was. But the truth was—I was scared. Not of him. Not really. I was scared of what this meant. For me. For Leo. For the life I’d worked so hard to build.

“You had no right,” I said quietly.

He leaned forward, voice calm, but tight. “I had every right. You disappeared after Tuscany. No number. No last name. You cut me out. And now I find out I have a four-year-old son with my eyes and my damn DNA?”

Tears blurred my vision. I blinked them back.

“I didn’t know who you were, Lucien. Not really. You left without a word.”

“So did you,” he shot back. “I woke up one morning, and you were gone.”

My throat tightened. “Because I saw the headline on your phone. Lucien Wolfe, heir to the WolfeTech fortune, missing from family estate. I realized everything had been a lie. You weren’t just some guy escaping the noise. You were—you. And I was… no one.”

Silence fell.

He stood, running a hand through his hair. “You still should have told me.”

I stood too, suddenly angry. “What would you have done? Sent a check? Sent your lawyers to take him from me?”

His jaw clenched. “You think I would take your son away?”

I didn’t answer.

“Our son,” he corrected sharply. “You had no right to make that decision for both of us.”

Now I was trembling. “I was scared. I didn’t even know if you’d care. I figured you’d deny it. Or worse—use him as leverage if it suited you. That’s what men like you do.”

He looked like I’d slapped him.

“Men like me.”

I regretted the words the moment they left my mouth.

Lucien’s voice lowered to something lethal. “You think I don’t care? You think I’m the kind of man who’d abandon his own son? You knew me, Isla. You knew who I was before the world ever got involved.”

“I thought I did,” I whispered.

We stared at each other, and for a moment, the walls between us cracked—just enough for the past to slip through. I saw the man I once loved in his eyes. The man who held me by the fire in Tuscany, who kissed my shoulder and promised he wasn’t going anywhere.

He was gone now.

This man? This man was fire and storm and vengeance, wrapped in an Armani suit and a heart that had turned to stone.

“I want to see him,” Lucien said at last, voice quieter now.

My stomach twisted. “You can’t just walk into his life. He doesn’t know you.”

“Then introduce us.”

I stared at him, panic rising. “Lucien—”

“I’m not asking, Isla. I’m telling you. You kept him from me once. You won’t do it again.”",1,1758744612.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I admire you for showing me great and true love through our friendship first and the romance that followed. Even though we no longer have a relationship, I never held an ounce of hate in my heart towards you. I am grateful for the time we had together, but I wish it was longer. I have tried to put myself in your shoes to understand why you did not want a relationship anymore, but I may never understand. I believe that love is a choice. It is a choice to be with someone through the good and bad, through connection and disconnect, through the easy and hard times. I do not understand why, but I do know that you did not choose me. It breaks my heart. You said that you were just holding onto our past, but we had so many amazing recent memories. We still had fun together, or at least I did. Our trip to Louisville at the end of July was so fun. I would never choose to go on a ghost tour, but I went because you were so excited. I genuinely enjoyed spending time with you up until the very end. The state fair and even spending time with you while you did your work brought me so much joy. I felt so blindsided because I was so secure in you and our relationship that I didn’t doubt a future together even though I also felt a disconnect. I thought we were going to fix whatever was wrong. I know it was starting to get intimidating thinking about the future in general, but I felt comfort in the idea of having you by my side. I wish you had told me how you felt sooner because we could have talked it out or made changes to combat those feelings of disconnect. I just feel like you never even gave us a chance once you started feeling that way. If you wanted it to work out, you would have had a conversation with me about what was bothering you. Instead, you pushed it off and bottled it up until it got to be too much and you told me that you did not think it would be fixed. You could have talked to someone else, too. It’s like you didn’t care. I knew that you were avoiding me in the days leading up to the breakup. I knew that you did not really have much work to do. I knew that you weren’t too busy. You didn’t want to talk to me because you didn’t want me to bring up the obvious. What was so scary about sharing your emotions? You bottled them up and held resentment towards me because of it. You were completely unfair to me and I did not deserve that. You said that you started feeling this way since you got back from study abroad, so what happened in Belfast? I originally thought that maybe you experienced some depression when you moved back here and I was worried about you. It was a big lifestyle change and that can be hard and it can translate into relationships. In the back of my mind, I think the real reason was because you wanted to try something out with someone else even though you told me that was not the reason. I just do not think that someone could love me and want to spend time with me, but not want to have a relationship with me. That reason cannot be true because it is an oxymoron. How could you say that you don’t want to pursue me anymore, yet you want to be friends? Friends still have to pursue each other to be friends. How could you say that you felt this way and still went on my family vacation and invited me to go to Canada with your family? I was there and I did not see the same disconnect that you did. I keep replaying every moment that we had together over the summer and I think of how blissfully dumb I was. From sneaking kisses when no one was looking to cuddling under the midnight stars. I was so in love with you. I felt a connection with you. I want to believe that you were in love with me, too. How can you act like that if you truly felt distant? 
I missed you so much last semester while you were gone. I cried so many times because I just wanted you there with me, so I learned how to navigate college without you. Every once in a while, when I started missing you, I would read the letter you sent me for Valentine’s Day. “Our second of many.” Little did I know that was the last letter I would receive. 
These past few weeks, I found myself waiting for a text or a call from you. I just wanted to see your name pop up on my phone and I hoped it would be a ‘hey you wanna grab coffee and chat?’ text or a ‘hey I’d love to meet up and catch up’ text. 
A big part of me secretly hopes that we will get back together, but another part of me is screaming that I did not deserve this heartbreak. Ok well, all of me wants to get back together, but I am not going to get on my knees and beg for you to come back to me. I deserve to be chosen, loved, and pursued. I just wish it was you.

I’m 90% sure I know which exact resort Bonnie was talking about. I was gifted a 1 night stay there with complimentary activities. I remember arriving and just like Bonnie described it, you drive through a long driveway til you reach these very large gates where you have to give your booking info to be buzzed in. Very luxurious, exclusive and expensive, probably why I have never heard of it. Its not your typical San Diego resort overlooking the beach or the coast, this one was nestled within canyons. It was acres of just trees and sprawling land.

I had a massage reserved and fortunately no unexpected reiki or entities attaching to me but I just remember having a weird, eerie, almost like a heavy feeling in those separate spa rooms. It might just be because they’re outdated compared to the rest of the facility? It looked like  an old clinic were they would perform lobotomies, I’m not even joking. Other areas I felt weird were the dining halls. There is definitely a weird “energy” on the resort grounds. But other than that, nothing out of the ordinary happened. It was a nice staycation.

Now, I dont have much knowledge with spiritual practices but it’s frustrating when people do these practices that they absolutely have no business touching. That therapist was inexperienced and most likely summoned whatever that entity was, not to mention they did that on someone that did not even consent to it. I love Jack’s ending comment bc Bonnie should’ve raised hell with a manager. Idc if you get my coffee order wrong but playing with my life like that???

Bahrain’s Business Landscape in 2025: Unprecedented Growth, Global Confidence\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting with Gulf business district. rankings position Manama among the most attractive Gulf capitals for foreign direct investment. Reuters recently noted a 6.2% year-on-year GDP growth, with the financial services and logistics sectors especially buoyant. The introduction of 100% foreign ownership in 99% of commercial activities (see KeyLink’s guide) and the streamlining of Sijilat commercial registration have cut setup times by half since 2023.\
Bahrain’s free zones and business-friendly regulations set it apart from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Where Dubai can feel crowded and Riyadh regulatory processes slow, Bahrain’s small size, direct government engagement (especially at EDB and MOICT), and deep-rooted business culture make it remarkably agile. I once incorporated a client’s holding company in the Diplomatic Area in less than 10 days—a feat virtually impossible elsewhere in the GCC.\
Why Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Matter for Bahrain Company Formation\
Commercial disputes are inevitable, especially in cross-border deals common in Bahrain’s open economy. Arbitration—particularly international arbitration—has become the preferred method for resolving conflicts efficiently and confidentially. But the real question for seasoned executives and first-time founders alike is this:\
\
Will Bahrain actually enforce an international arbitration award quickly and reliably?\
\
Bahrain’s Legal Framework for Arbitrating and Enforcing Awards\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for arbitration processes. to Bahrain’s Arbitration Law (Law No. 9 of 2015) further clarifies the expedited mechanisms for recognizing and enforcing foreign awards through the High Civil Court—reducing the statutory processing period from 60 to 30 days.\
The Legislative Backbone\
\
Arbitration Law (Law No. 9 of 2015): Modeled on UNCITRAL standards, governing both domestic and international arbitrations seated in Bahrain.\
New York Convention: Bahrain will enforce awards from any country party to the Convention, subject to very narrow exceptions (e.g., public order).\
Judiciary Structure: The High Civil Court handles enforcement proceedings, located in the Diplomatic Area within Manama. Forget the intimidating queues you might expect at MOICT; there is a dedicated counter for arbitration-related filings (go early on Wednesdays—trust me, it’s half the wait).\
\
Practical Example: Enforcement in Action\
Two years ago, I supported a Singaporean tech firm with enforcement of a $2.3 million SIAC award. After registering the award and translation with the High Civil Court, we obtained exequatur within just over a month—a remarkable pace even by international standards. The debtor’s Bahraini bank accounts were attached within two working days.\
Step-by-Step: How to Enforce an International Arbitration Award in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation during arbitration enforcement..\
2. Prepare Documents (Insider shortcut: Have professional certified translations ready—Sijilat clerks will send you back if your Arabic translation isn’t up to MOICT standards. I once lost a week here!)\
\
Required Documents:\
Authenticated copy of the arbitral award\
Arbitration agreement\
Certified Arabic translation (if needed)\
Proof of service to the respondent\
\
3. Application to the High Civil Court\
\
File the enforcement application with supporting documents at the High Civil Court in the Diplomatic Area.\
Pay the relevant filing fees (typically BHD 100-200, see cost breakdown here).\
\
4. Notice to Debtor\
\
The court notifies the debtor, who can object only on limited grounds (e.g., procedural defects, violation of due process, or award not yet final).\
\
5. Court Review & Exequatur\
\
If no valid objections, exequatur (execution order) is granted within 30 days under the revised 2025 law.\
\
6. Execution\
\
With exequatur in hand, proceed to enforcement—freezing assets, bank accounts, or even seizing property.\
Bahrain’s enforcement officers are diligent, and attachments are processed swiftly—a distinct advantage over some Gulf neighbors.\
\
Real-World Timeframes and Cost Considerations\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for arbitration enforcement in Bahrain. per enforcement application\
- Translation and notarization: BHD 50-150 (USD 130-400) depending on length and service provider\
- Legal representation: Most local firms charge BHD 1,500-3,000 (USD 4,000-8,000), but specialized arbitration boutiques in Bahrain Bay or the Seef District may offer fixed-fee packages, especially if you’re handling multiple awards\
- Typical timeline: 30–60 days if the documents are in order and the debtor does not mount a frivolous defense\
\
Tip: Schedule your filing at the High Civil Court for Wednesday mornings; Mondays are swamped after weekend backlogs, while Thursdays run short-staffed due to early Friday closings.\

Challenges, Insider Solutions, and Bahrain-Specific Best Practices\
A Common Pitfall: Incomplete Documentation\
A surprising number of applicants forget to include the certified translation or miss one notarization step. (I learned to triple-check the MOICT checklist before booking those costly legal stamps—saving my clients both BH D and frustration.)\
Local Customs: When Majlis Meets Modernity\
During Ramadan, court business hours shorten sharply. Plan filings outside of peak prayer times and avoid expecting same-day responses. Traditional Bahrain business etiquette often involves offering coffee to court clerks or interpreters—yes, this still oils the wheels, though always handle such gestures with tact.\
My Biggest Challenge—And Solution\
My toughest enforcement case involved a recalcitrant debtor with friends in high places. The key was maintaining open communication with the enforcement office—and, crucially, hiring a Bahraini advocate familiar with the unwritten power dynamics in the Diplomatic Area. Cultivate these relationships early; they matter a lot more than even the most perfectly drafted legal memo.\
2025 Regulatory Update: Streamlined Digital Filings\
As of April 2025, Bahrain’s Sijilat platform allows pre-registration of enforcement applications for arbitral awards. While the physical submission is still required at the High Civil Court, digital preregistration cuts waiting times by up to 60%. (The best part? You can now book your filing slot online—no more dawn queues at Diplomatic Area.)\
Comparison: Bahrain vs UAE and Saudi Arabia\
Bahrain’s smaller scale is its hidden strength. While the UAE has DIFC and Abu Dhabi Global Market, both are swamped by case volume and sometimes longer timelines. In Saudi Arabia, enforcement can be unpredictable if the award conflicts with local Sharia principles. Bahrain’s courts, in contrast, have a strong recent track record of honoring both Western and Asian arbitral awards—so long as you meet the formalities.\
Business Structures and Ownership: Choosing the Right Entity for Dispute Protection\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration for Bahrain companies.: Most common for SMEs; shields owners from direct liability, and courts respect the corporate veil if proper governance is observed\
- B.S.C. (Closed and Public): Best for larger ventures or family offices; allows for multiple shareholders and smoother asset structuring\

Explore the full range and nuances via this in-depth guide to Bahrain business types.\
And when forming your entity, don’t overlook Bahrain’s free zones (see benefits here); awards against entities domiciled in free zones are subject to the same enforcement regime, with added expatriate-friendly features.\
Compliance, Accounting, and Ongoing Obligations\
\

Don’t cut corners: engage a Bahrain-based service—like this accounting and compliance specialist—who understands local quirks (one client lost an entire summer’s worth of Tamkeen wage support due to a missing Arabic payslip).\
Pro Tips for Time and Money Savings\
\
Document Preparation: Pre-certify and translate arbitration agreements at the time of contract signing—not after a dispute arises.\
Best Filing Windows: File enforcement petitions outside national holidays (notably Eid and Bahrain National Day); schedules can slip by weeks otherwise.\
Networking: Frequenting the majlis at the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce or coffee shops in Bahrain Bay builds vital connections. (I once secured a last-minute expedited court appointment over a casual espresso at Al Abraaj.)\
Use Local Agents: Assign a Bahraini agent to handle court service—locals often get faster responses, especially during peak business months.\

Support and Resources: Who Can Help?\
\
Alt text: Professional business support for arbitration matters in Bahrain.): For hands-on support from inception to enforcement.\
- Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB): For regulatory updates and investment promotion resources.\
- Local law firms in Seef and Diplomatic Area: Many have dedicated arbitration desks, and some provide bilingual services for complex, cross-border cases.\
- Official news portals (Gulf News – Bahrain section, Reuters – Bahrain market):** For tracking regulatory updates and major local business wins.\
FAQ: International Arbitration Award Enforcement in Bahrain\
How long does it take to enforce an international arbitration award in Bahrain?\
Normally between 30 and 60 days—if documentation is in order and the award does not face substantive objections. Recent digitalization via Sijilat should shave this down further in the second half of 2025.\
What are the main grounds to refuse enforcement?\
Refusals are rare, but possible if:\
- The award violates Bahraini public policy (interpreted narrowly)\
- The arbitral process was fundamentally unfair\
- The award has not yet become final/binding\
Do free zone companies fall under Bahrain’s enforcement regime?\
Absolutely. Both mainland and free zone entities are subject to the same enforcement regime. Free zone advantages include simplified labor onboarding (see 100% foreign ownership guidance).\
Is a Bahraini lawyer necessary for enforcement applications?\
While technically not mandatory, in reality a local advocate is invaluable for navigating the High Civil Court and Sijilat systems—and for avoiding common pitfalls with translation and certification. I always recommend budgeting for local legal support; it pays for itself many times over.\
What business structures minimize enforcement risk and maximize foreign investor protection?\
A W.L.L. offers a good balance for most, but larger ventures will benefit from B.S.C. structures. See full business type guide to compare pros and cons.\

Final Word: Bahrain’s Advantage in Arbitration Enforcement\
Surprisingly, what started as a tangent—my quick coffee meeting in Seef—often yields more success than the most careful legal preparation. Bahrain’s unique blend of fast-track courts, digital platforms, and personal relationships gives it a major edge for anyone forming a company and doing cross-border business in the Gulf.\
Go prepared, connect early, and remember: meticulous documentation and trusted in-country partners turn enforcement from a risk into a competitive advantage.\

We’ve talked about marriage, long-term plans, and even moving back to my home country together.

Recently, I’ve developed a crush on a colleague (25F) in my grad program. She’s attractive, confident, smart — the whole package. We message on Teams a lot, usually during work hours, and here’s what’s been happening:
	•	She sometimes/often starts the conversation herself.
	•	We’ve had coffee or lunch together, always in group settings.
	•	She once brought me a Red Bull when I asked and wouldn’t let me pay her back.
	•	She teases me sometimes in the group chat.
	•	She’s asked about my girlfriend and shared details about her own breakup.
	•	Most conversations are light — TV, weekends, work stuff — but personal topics pop up occasionally.

What hasn’t happened:
	•	No messages outside work hours.
	•	No invites to hang out alone offsite.
	•	No romantic comments or obvious flirting.
	•	No social media adds or texting.

The issue is me: I’ve caught feelings even though nothing physical has happened. I love my girlfriend and don’t want to hurt her, but I can’t avoid this colleague entirely because of work and the dynamic of the grad community, and the constant chatting makes it harder and starting to feel she may be subtly interested too.

TL;DR: In a long-term relationship but have a crush on a colleague I see and chat with every day. Nothing inappropriate has happened, but I want the crush to fade so I can stay fully loyal to my girlfriend.

I have 9 older siblings including some half siblings and In laws. I live with my parents and my youngest brother (15). I don’t remember much from this time period but I know that when I was a toddler, there were 7/8 of us kids living in the house including my second youngest brother, Josh. I don’t remember him leaving but he is my half brother so he spent a lot of time with his mum and it therefore took me months to notice he left. I was 7 at the time and he was 17. My parents told me for years that he was in the army but when I was 10 or 11, I realised that it wasn’t adding up and after months of digging, (there’s no record of him on the internet so I just had to search old documents and memorabilia) I discovered what really happened. It turns out, he got involved with the wrong sort of people in secondary school (his mum is like that so it wasn’t a huge shock) and he stabbed someone, they survived but he got 3 years in prison. I’ve spent years trying to find him and can’t. My 15 year old brother found out the truth last year. I’m pretty mature for my age and am basically independent but he is a moron so my parents didn’t didn’t trust him(they know I know). Josh contacted my mum (his stepmother) yesterday and he wants to meet me, my mum and my brother for coffee after school on Monday (it’s Thursday rn) I’m really nervous as I don’t even remember what he looks like and he’s had every chance for the last 3 years to get in touch. But I’m also really excited as I missed him for years; Like I said, I don’t remember much about him so i kinda stopped missing him.

Right now, I’ve made it Warsaw-only for the first testing phase, since apps like this only work if people in the same city use it.

It’s very much an **MVP** — the basics are there (sign up, make a profile, create/join events), but I’m still improving things like safety reminders and extra features.

If you’re curious, I’d love if you:

* Created a small event, or
* Just told me what feels useful / confusing.

I want to cast a money spell, of certain amount to get rid of my debt. I have never done anything like this before but I feel that it might work as I believe in it. I'm not sure where to start or what to do. 
I thought about going to a witch and ask help from her but since I have been researching a little on this, I believe I might be able to do it myself. 

I have few questions before I do anything. 

1. Based on my research I have only limited supplies, for example sugar cinnamon, cardimom, bay leaf, coffee, honey coins and rice. All these items have been used in preparing food except coins so they are not fresh or pure. Does that impact anything? If not then how could I use these items to caste spell? Also, is there any specific spell I need to use like chant or pray? Also I do not have a jar. 

2. If I mess up anything during the process would the spell have a negative impact? Does anything can cause the spell to be against what I want to achieve?

Any proper steps to step directions or guidance is appreciated.

Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Anyway, that is all from me, I believe. If you are interested, perhaps have some questions, feel free to poke your head in my DMs! Hopefully hear from you soon!",1,1758743744.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

I give it a last chance to find my MBTI type. :) I didn't try this sub yet. Thank you for your time and help. I'll use the recommended questions. Please note that I am not native English speaker. So far people saw me already as several different types, and that is a little confusing. I accepted one type and then someone came and said ""no, you are not that, you sound like this other"" ... I envy a little those who are easily typed. XD :D They have much less work with it. :D :D :D

* Give a general description of yourself. How old are you? (I'm not good at introductions. 39, female, ""Mage of Void"", cat mom, DIY person)

* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? If you are not working, what kind of job do you want to do or what are you studying? (financial administrator, I ended up in this career for survival, I can't say it comes naturally, fortunately I have other tasks too so it isn't too boring, I don't do well with monotony)

* Describe your childhood/upbringing. Did it have any kind of ideological or structured influence? How did you respond to it? Did you have any significant negative experiences that may have affected how you think or behave? (Complicated. I grew up in a poor family, my parents showed me some really unhealthy patterns, I guess I've been through some trauma, but nobody really cared about my feelings. I got confusing signs especially from my father, in front of others he was a proud parent, at home he was always disappointed, complained about me not being social enough, discouraged my artistic hobbies, I don't really know if anything would make him satisfied XD ; I mean I had good grades, I wasn't dumb or too lazy to study... yes, I didn't get friends, because other kids didn't like me because of my look. I was always very insecure around people. As a teenager the first signs of PCOS started to appear, but I wasn't diagnosed yet. So I experienced a lot of insecurities and shame about that too.)

* Do you have any mental or physical health issues that might affect how think or choose to live? Provide a brief description. (PCOS tends to mess with one's emotions. Sometimes I feel too emotional. It doesn't bother as long as it stays on the ""few tears during an emotional scene in a movie""-level, but sometimes I become impatient with people, and then I regret that. I just try to stay alone then if I can.)

* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? (Sounds like a very good plan. XD It would be even too short to really find time for everything I like doing undisturbed. Painting, practicing archery, staying up late and take the telescope outside... finishing the books I started... writing... making some good food... etc.)

* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage? (I don't know if it makes sense, but I prefer connecting physical activity with something useful, for example I walk a lot... but I usually have a destination, like a shop or something, but if I don't, then I do this to try out alternative routs to expand my inside map of the city, discover things, small stores I wouldn't find in any other ways... I'm a beginner archer, I love it because I can practice it alone without being embarrassed in front of others. I admit I avoid things like dancing or trying a gym, because there are people. I don't think I left behind the old shame, especially after getting ""nice"" comments even in my workplace... I don't know it yet, but I might try the local archery group. Archers come in all shapes and sizes and ages, so maybe I wouldn't be a misfit there.)

* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? (I'm curious, but only about things I'm interested at the time. I'm not curious about gossips and other people's private lives. I think I have more ideas I can do, but not extreme amount of ideas, if I don't do them it's partly because of the lack of time, lack of energy, lack of money, or losing motivation for various reasons. But the important ones I finish sooner or later. My ideas about art, repairing or changing things around my home and garden, story ideas, ideas to learn something like a language... but originally I wanted to be a teacher, then I had ideas about teaching, how I could help to students with problems etc. Now I have ideas about archery equipment if it gets serious enough...)

* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? (No. I don't want power over others. Also I'm aware that people in leadership positions change with time. It changes their empathy, lowers it. I wouldn't be a good leader, because I don't want to be one. But I would be good at selecting people for certain tasks. I'm good at seeing/recognizing potential and talents and abilities in others. )

* Do you prefer hands on activities or working with your hands in some form? Describe your activities. (Yep. Drawing, painting, making jewelry, occasionally sewing simple things, planting flowers, cutting hair... I have this silly habit of touching different textures just to get an idea about them, like fabric, wall, or paving slab and tile samples in shops XD but I do that with other senses too, I remember spices, smells... it helps me to select the one material I need for something later, and it's kind of pleasant. I feel the difference between cats' fur too.)

* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer. (Yes. The most characteristic thing about my art that I don't have a consistent style. I tried a wide variety of tools too, also sometimes colorful, sometimes less colorful... I like unusual materials too like coffee. Also people don't really understand it. I recently realized that. I thought they just don't like it, but probably they don't understand it, and then it's boring to them. I kept art as a hobby against the discouraging experiences. I also feel that I hold myself back, because I care too much about it how people would react if I would depict things like negative emotions... for example. But I don't like hiding my pictures either. I don't see the point of painting them and then not showing. But I also know I can fell into the trap of caring way too much about what people might enjoy seeing. At some point I didn't know what I wanted to see on my pictures any more. So I'm currently in a kind of healing process from that state.)

* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them? (All has good and bad. Past good: things I already learnt, knowledge. Past bad: trauma, losing friends. Present good: having a stable job, less drama than in the past. Present bad: feeling a little lonely, still being more poor than not. Future bad: losing family members (age), and it is very unlikely that I'll have a child. Future good: I might be able to find at least some friends, and maybe have an exhibition once. How do I deal with them? I don't have to deal with them, time just goes I'd rather not carry a pocket singularity just to slow it. What I have to deal with is the bad patterns I picked up, and the fears, things like that.)

* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? (The key is what that ""anything"" is. If it's something that truly doesn't require my help, then I let them handle it. If it's something they can't do and I can, and I have the capacity to do it, then I would probably help. Why not? It feels better to help, even if I probably wouldn't really ask help from others. I feel best if I can solve something by myself. But I'm not dumb, if I need an extra hand with something, or it would take too long to learn something, then I'll ask someone's help of course.)

* Do you need logical consistency in your life? (Up to a point. But I'm not so rigid that I couldn't change my views if something I believe turns out to be incorrect. And occasionally I enjoy some chaos.)

* How important is efficiency and productivity to you? (Important, but not at all cost, being lazy is important too. XD)

* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? (Control or manipulate? I don't control people. But everyone manipulates others. If I praise a meal in front of someone, I manipulate them in a way to try it. If I encourage people, I manipulate them to be more confident. If I go into small talk at work, I present a more social image than I really am, and the purpose of it is to communicate to them I'm safe, approachable, they can ask me I won't bite their head off.. and I benefit from it when I need help. It helps cooperation. But see me in the store XD... I dislike when people come too close, then I discourage them to do that. :)  )

* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them? (I think I talked about them above. Art - I like it because it's a language. And colors and images can stir up feelings I can't really describe. Archery - it's love, there is something special about knowing that my ancestors used such weapons, it's connection to the distant past, also philosophy, I think one needs to feel respect toward the weapon because of the danger it holds in itself.)

* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? (I need to understand something to learn it. I struggle when I get a partial information and I can't connect it to anything, and can't see through the entire process. Books and experiences are both fine for learning.)

* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? (Average. I do a bit of both. I can make plans, but if I realize it won't work the way I thought, then switching to alternative is perfectly fine. I think I could probably group the tasks into units that can be done at once and the doing the rest another time.)

* What's important to you and why? (I don't understand the question. Important in which area?)
* What are your aspirations? (To build a decent calm life I can enjoy, no hurry, no drama... and not entirely useless.)
* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why? (X ; I don't like talking about fears. I treat them as something personal. It usually involves fears about the future. Uncomfortable? XD A lot of things from too much noise to weird men being interested in me... and that woman on the bus who climbed through me to get a seat... that was disgusting >.< ... also those insecurities I talked about. I don't hate. In the past I hated a very few people who actually caused some damage to me... but it takes a lot to make me really hate. I don't like the feeling, it's too strong and too negative, and eats up too much mental energy without having any use. But there are things that annoy me, like littering, or when some people are so dumb I don't have anyone to talk to, but I'm still supposed to explain something to them...)

* What do the ""highs"" in your life look like? (colorful?)
* What do the ""lows"" in your life look like? (dark and cold)

* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? (I'm usually aware of my surroundings. If I'm not then I'm most likely sleep deprived. :D I guess I'm daydreaming, when I write for fun. But that time is dedicated to that, and then I prefer to close out everything with music or something...)

* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? (It depends on if I went inside willingly or not. XD If not, then I'd think about finding a way out. :D If willingly, then just meditate - preferably in dark - and let my mind do crazy wanderings. :D)

* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? (long, it is possible if I get new important information or think it though and realize I rather wanted something different...)

* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? (I don't know how long. It depends on how well, how fast I can recognize what's going on. They are important, because emotions are part of me. I don't want to be emotionless, that's scary and unhealthy. But they certainly cause a lot of problems, or keep me from trying good things too... but without them I can't make any art. I experienced that after a trauma, grief, somehow my brain almost muted my emotions for a while, and I couldn't access art to relax or give out tension or anything... I thought I won't be able to do it again. )

* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? (I can pretend to agree. Is that what this question asks? Well if I see that disagreement would be pointless or not worth the effort, then sure. I don't feel like arguing with people about every minor things. What for? :D )

* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you? (Not really, but currently I don't really meet rules that doesn't make sense. And if they really don't, then I just keep them out of self interest, I wouldn't want to risk my job, because something is illogical in bureaucracy... I learnt to play the game by the given rules. It doesn't hurt. Sometimes it's actually less work... for example giving only what is asked without anything extra. 🤷‍♀️ )

* What is the ideal life, in your opinion? (generally peaceful in the meaning of no drama, but colorful with pleasant new experiences and options to learn and develop one's abilities)

1npm4fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1npm4fu/aitah_for_picking_my_sisters_side_when_she_was/,AITAH for picking my sister's side when she was objectively being a dick?,"TL;DR : My sister made some hurtful comments to and about our half-sibling's boyfriend over dinner to the point that they now want to go no-contact. I think that's an excessive reaction. Half-sibling says I'm a coward for not calling her out on it. I don't want to be mad at my sister about it because I know she's grieving. 



I (34F) have one little sister (29) and we have a half-sibling (29 also) who we only met ten years ago, although we were always vaguely aware that our dad had another kid. Our relationship was very, very dodgy when we were younger but in recent years it got better, even pretty friendly. We live within reasonable driving distance, saw each other about once a month, have coffee, catch up and whatever else. 



Our father died eight months ago. He was extremely close to my little sister. She was pretty much his clone, always looked up to him, and he loved her more than anything. As you can imagine, she was gutted when he passed. She's always been kind of stoic but these days she's a brick wall. And she's always been kind of abrasive but these days she'll just snap from time to time and be an absolute twat. I know that's not who she is, she's just hurting, I deal with it and try to be there for her.



Lot of backstory but here's the heart of the matter : Last weekend, sister met half-sibling's boyfriend. I had already met him before, he seems nice enough. I insisted that they bring him to this dinner we had planned, even though they didn't think it was a good idea. Major fuck up on my part.



Two things about the boyfriend : he has an amputated leg and he's very tall, like 6'6 or something.



So everybody's over for dinner at my house and the moment this man walks in, my sister's face turns completely sour. He's being very polite and pretending he doesn't notice, goes to shake her hand, which she's visibly relunctant about. She didn't even stand up to greet him and half-sibling when they walked in. Half-sibling made a quip about it like ""nice to see you too"" or something but she didn't reply. And it just devolved from there.



I ask boyfriend about his family, he says he's an only child, my sister jokes that with his size, it's no wonder his mother didn't want another one. He laughs it off. Later, he further explains that his parents still live in the country he's from so he doesn't get to see them as often since he moved here, my sister asks how long he's been here and when he answers 11 years she jokes that it's weird he still has an accent. He laughs it off. He stands up to go to the bathroom and hits his head on the light fixture, she jokes ""bring the entire house down, why don't you?"" He laughs it off. Just firing these off one after the other for almost two straight hours. At some point, I don't remember exactly what she said but I had to kind of tap her on the shoulder to get her to stop. Half-sibling was not laughing, at all. Staring daggers at her the entire time.



Breaking point was when I asked about boyfriend's job. He says he's a machinist, writes programs to cut metal parts for a car manufacturer. My sister jokes ""Is that how you lost the leg? One of your programs gone wrong?"" He didn't laugh it off, his face just fell. I don't know how he really lost his leg but it was obviously a sore spot. Rightfully.



There was a second of silence, then half-sibling just goes ""Fuck you."" My sister keeps trying to act like it was an innocent joke but half-sibling stands up and is obviously about to tear into sister but their boyfriend kind of took their hand and asked them not to. I'm pretty sure that's the only reason they didn't take a swing at my sister in that moment. Boyfriend is obviously uncomfortable and trying to not cause a scene. I think my sister said something else but I was so embarrassed my ears were literally ringing, I don't remember.



They both just left awkwardly and quietly. I tried to apologise and boyfriend said he shouldn't have come and I felt terrible. He looked on the verge of tears.



I tried to talk to my sister when they had gone but she sort of shut me out for the evening. I asked if she was okay and she said yes but she also looked on the verge of tears at that point. I think she felt really guilty, I gave her a hug before she left.



I texted with half-sibling that evening and the day after and I apologised again and tried to get them to be compassionate towards her because she's still grieving. They say that that isn't an excuse because we all lost our dad but she's the only one acting ""that way"" and she's always been ""mean."" They say I'm overly lenient towards my sister, that I'm being a coward for not saying anything after she made those comments. They say she was being ableist and racist. I just don't think that scolding her like they want me to would help in the situation. I'm trying to mediate, since neither of them want to talk to each other.



So they said if that's how I feel and if I'm not willing to ""stand up"" to her, then they need to cut ties with both of us at least for a while. So I said okay, and we haven't talked since.



Now I don't know. I honestly feel bad for the boyfriend, he tried his best and I'm sure he didn't come to dinner expecting to be talked to like that but I think half-sibling is being a bit radical, cutting ties while we're all grieving. I don't see how that's supposed to help.",1,1758743450.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

1npm1oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1npm1oc/events_to_help_you_meet_new_people_explore_the/,"Events to help you meet new people & explore the city, beginning with a free Water/Fall Festival Meetup THIS SUNDAY!","Hey Toronto Redditors!

We're Denys & Dan, and have been living in and around this amazing city for years,but noticed a common theme: there are so many cool things to do, but it's not always easy to find a group to do them with! We've both tried attending various events and using social apps, but often feel like there's a missing piece when it comes to truly fostering genuine connection.

That's why **we're launching a new series of events designed to bring people together, inspire new friendships, and explore the best of Toronto**. Think of it as a low-pressure way to meet like-minded individuals and discover new experiences, without the awkwardness!

# A little about us:

* **Denys:** I moved to Toronto with my parents when I was 4 and have lived here ever since. I love to travel and spend time outdoors. Whether it be running, biking or just strolling around, you will almost never find me inside (expect when I am working). Furthermore, over the last couple of years, I have turned into a bit of a coffee addict, and now know almost every cafe in the city.
* **Dan:** I was born in Toronto, raised in the suburbs, and have once-again called Toronto home for 5 years now. I'm a huge foodie: I love cooking, baking, and exploring Toronto’s culinary gems. I'm also really into sports and fitness, especially basketball and spin classes. While I enjoy a good night out (especially if there’s EDM music involved), I've found myself spending more and more time doing chill activities like board game nights, waterfront walks, and run clubs.

# Who is this for?

Inspired by all the ""I want to do fun things, but I don't have a group to do it with"" and ""I'm new to the city and looking to meet people"" posts we see on Reddit, we're creating a space for you to connect with new people. 

We anticipate most attendees will be young professionals in their 20s and 30s, primarily living Downtown. While you're welcome to bring a +1, our focus is really on creating an environment where everyone is open to making new friends, so solo individuals are more than welcome!

# The events

Each event will begin with some ice-breakers to help everyone get to know each other. Other than our first event, we will have at least a small fee to discourage no-shows so we can create reliable and engaging experiences for everyone, powered by a proprietary ice breaker algorithm we’re building. Some events (e.g., our Cookie Crawl) will include certain items as well.

* **Water/Fall Festival Meetup - Sep 28 @ 5:30pm - Harbourfront:** Let's get together and check out the Water/Fall Festival at Toronto's Harbourfront Centre! This inaugural, free festival is a great way to explore the waterfront and experience some incredible art and culture. We'll meet up at 5:30 p.m. for introductions and icebreakers, then head over to the food market to grab some dinner and drinks before exploring the unique art installations, live performances, and exhibits. This will be a casual, low-pressure evening by the water, perfect for meeting new people and enjoying a beautiful fall night. We can't wait to see you there!

* **High Park Sunset Hike - Oct 8 @ 6pm - High Park:** Grab a warm sweater and join us on a relaxing hike around High Park! Come solo or with a friend, meet other fellow nature lovers and enjoy the great outdoors. We will meet right outside of the Grenadier Cafe at 6:00pm and spend 2 hours exploring the various trails of this amazing park. Afterwards, we will head over to a nearby bar for food and drinks.

* **Toronto Waterfront Bike Ride - Oct 25 @ 6:30pm - Fort York:** If you are an avid biker or someone looking to get into biking, this event is for you. We’ll meet at 6:30 right in front of Princes' Gates at the CNE for introductions and icebreakers. The ride will start immediately after and take us out west to Etobicoke. We will be aiming at riding a total of 30-40km and will end the ride where we started. Post ride drinks will be taking place in Liberty Village and are optional but highly encouraged.

* **Cookie Crawl - Oct 26 @ 10am - Fashion District:** Join us for a sweet and scenic stroll through two of our favourite local cookie shops to sample the city’s best chocolate chip cookies! Plus, we’ll take a detour through Toronto’s famous Graffiti Alley for some photos and light exploration. [**Link to register.**](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/high-park-sunset-hike-cruu-meet-new-people-find-your-cruu-tickets-1738348450009?aff=reddit)

And this is just the start! We're planning a diverse range of activities to cater to different interests.

We’re looking forward to meeting you!

I have been taking naps every day for 3 weeks straight. I am absolutely exhausted, even when drinking coffee. Not too much has changed environmentally. (Not pregnant)

I went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago and had somewhat normal labs.

I have 75% for neutrophils, and 17,8% for Lymphs. Also 1.8 for TSH. I have no cough, runny nose, congestion or fever.

I found a small lump on my neck, that feels soft, and going again this Friday to demand more testing. That same side of neck feels more swollen than the other side as well.

What should I advocate for? I want them to do more testing to rule things out.

I feel likes it’s Thyroid related, due to the lower levels, and 2 years ago I went from 105-160 in a few months. I was diagnosed with POTS around that time and put a lot of my symptoms under that. I just worry its cancer related. I don’t have access to in depth family history.

I have the occasional night sweats, but they’re inconsistent. No fevers, that I am unaware.

I have been diagnosed with depression in the past, and have worked 70 hours plus a week. This exhaustion feels so incredibly different, like uncontrollable. I am not someone thats naps often.

It took several doctors visits to be diagnosed with the POTS, and it was very discouraging. I dont want to endure that again, so this appointment I want to be demanding. I have no problem paying for the testing for some peace.",1,1758743051.0,AskDocs,4,1.0,False

1nplwxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNSUBSCRIBEpodcast/comments/1nplwxw/hello_the_silence_chapter_4/,"Hello? ""The Silence"" Chapter 4.","
Chapter 4: The Knocking

Loud, continuous knocking shook the door, followed by a deep, gentle “Hello?”
“What the fuck?” I thought, heart pounding.
Rich had said no one was allowed in the 20, mile zone. And especially with the fire going on near by. staff only. A lost hiker, maybe? I didn’t know, but the knocking grew louder, harder, insistent.
I stood, glancing at the machete by the desk. Better be safe than sorry. I slowly get up to grab it, then tucking it behind me to avoid scaring a potential hiker, and I then crept to the door. Just in case, I called out, “Hello?”

The knocking stopped. Dead silence.
I gripped the knob, turned it slowly, and pulled the door open. Nothing. Not a soul, not a footprint in the dirt. The woods stared back, still, like they were holding their breath. I grabbed the flashlight from the desk and circled the cabin, staying close to its walls. Crickets chirped, owls hooted in the distance—peaceful, normal. But something felt wrong, like the silence was waiting to return.

“What the actual hell was that?” I muttered, heading back inside. I locked the door, checked every window, and shut off the lights. It was nearly 1:30 a.m. I’d done my nightly check outside, as Josh had asked, and everything seemed fine, except for that knocking. The outhouse hole in the bathroom caught my eye as I passed. It was too deep, too dark, like it led somewhere beyond dirt. I shivered, avoiding it.

Exhausted, I brushed my teeth, washed my face, grateful for the heated water. I changed, climbed into my sleeping bag on the twin bed—clean but well-worn, its sheets questionable. The cabin was chilly, the sleeping bag a smart choice. I zipped up, got comfortable, and passed out, the woods’ peaceful sounds lulling me to sleep. A good night, despite everything.

I woke around 8:30 a.m. the next morning. Not having slept well from last night. I unzip my sleeping bag, the cold air biting me. Getting out of my sleeping bag took serious effort, who likes waking up freezing? 

I got up and started on my morning routine, start the coffee, brush my teeth, put on clean clothes, have my coffee, and be ready for the new day ahead, and my new journey to begin. 

(Several months later)

Time has flew by out here. 
When I arrived, it was chilly, leaves just falling. Now, a blanket of snow draped everything, turning my zone into a breathtaking wonderland. The beauty of the woods never ceased, but I couldn’t shake the memory of that first night’s knocking, or the way the silence felt alive, waiting.

I spent days patrolling, mapping landmarks, distinctive rocks, creeks, trees. I noted animal patterns. a massive buck with an impressive rack leading a deer herd, squirrels scurrying, a colorful duck flying overhead with a unique neck band. I snapped a photo of two chipmunks on a snow dusted log, snowflakes falling gently past them. 

My reports to Rich and headquarters were detailed, sent via the cabin’s ancient computer. I was getting pretty damn good at Texas Hold ’Em in my downtime, I started one of my puzzles, and I finished reading one of my books. 
though the oven’s worn knobs still baffled me, I set it and wait for it to warm up, and then cook by guesswork and pull it out before it gets to burnt. 

No more silences or ghostly visitors since that first night. I said “Hello” every time I stepped outside, entered a new area, or returned to the cabin. It was second nature now, a ritual to keep whatever haunted these woods at bay.
Things felt normal... for a while.

Then one morning, I woke late, around 10 a.m. Something was wrong. Silence. Absolute, suffocating silence. No birds, no wind, nothing.
“Maybe I’m still half asleep,” I told myself, heading to the bathroom. I peed, couldn’t hear it. Brushed my teeth, washed my face, no sound of water, no clink of the sink. It was like the woods had swallowed sound itself, just like that first night.
Had I forgotten to say “Hello” yesterday? I didn’t think so, but I wasn’t taking chances. “Hello!” I called, waiting for the woods’ sounds to return, like before. 

Nothing. No gentle “Hello” echoed back, just deafening silence. I couldn’t even hear my own voice.
Panic crept in. I threw on a pair pants, a tee shirt, and some slippers I brought, stepped outside, and yelled, “Hello!” Still nothing. 

“Oh shit, this can’t be good.” I hurried back inside, sat at the computer, and emailed the station: “Rich, Josh, you there? I just woke up and I can’t hear anything. What’s going on?”

Minutes later, Jonah replied.
""Alex, it’s Jonah. Rich and Josh are meeting with neighboring rangers about downed trees blocking some roads. I’m holding down the station. Have you been saying ‘Hello’?”

“Yes, every damn time I move or breathe! I’ve been religious about it. Are you saying it?” I typed, frustrated.

“Of course,” Jonah wrote. “I've worked here for Four years, never slipped up once. I can hear fine, the station’s safe. The fence keeps it out. You sure you’ve been saying it?”

“YES, I SWEAR! If we’re all saying it, why’s this happening?”

Jonah took a while to respond. 
""It happened once before, a year ago, off-season. A homeless man wandered into the zone. Silence hit, stayed for a week. In the station it was fine, but in the zone, We couldn’t hear a thing, Police came and took him, he couldn’t speak, just stared blankly. We never learned why it lifted, but it didn’t stop until he was gone, maybe he's not even alive."" 

My stomach dropped. 
""So, someone’s out here, lost, causing this? Was he deaf or mute?”

“Probably, one or the other."" Jonah replied. “Couldn’t talk, wouldn't write, or even sign. Just stared. If someone’s in the zone who can’t say ‘Hello,’ it stirs things up."" 

""What happened to him?""

""No idea. Once the police took him, we never heard anything else about him. But If you can’t hear, that has to mean someone’s out there.”

“Should I head to the station, and we search together?”

“No, I can’t leave. Rich’s orders: someone stays for radio and messages. Start at your cabin, search east toward the station, check in before heading back.”

Great. I had to find a lost person in this silent hell, alone, without hearing. Whatever was out here didn’t just want ‘Hello’—it needed it, and someone’s silence was breaking everything. 

""Okay,” I typed. “I’ll pack a few things and start east. What’s the safe code for the gun?”

Jonah hesitated. “Not allowed to give it out, unless it’s an absolute emergency.”

“THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE FUCKING EMERGENCY, JONAH! GIVE ME THE CODE!”

“2709. there's Shells and a bag to carry them in inside. Be safe, bring your radio. If you’re not here by nightfall, I’ll come looking.”

“I’ll do my best,” I replied.

I threw on cold-weather gear, packed food, water, an extra jacket, flashlight, batteries, and radio. I opened the safe, loaded the 12-gauge, slung the ammo bag over my shoulder, grabbed my map, and headed east. 

The silence felt heavier, like it was watching. I had 10 miles to cover before dark, hoping to find whoever was causing this and stop it, for their safety and ours.
Five miles in, around 2 p.m., I made good time despite the silence. Dark clouds rolled in, and snow fell hard, blanketing the trail. I neared a pond I’d marked, expecting it frozen, empty of animals.

I was wrong.

The massive buck I’d noted was thrashing in the pond, breaking ice, covered in blood. Around it, the bodies of his herd lay scattered, torn apart. The silence wasn’t just quiet—it was driving the woods to slaughter.
“What the hell is going on?” I thought, frozen, watching the buck’s frenzied destruction.
It turned, saw me, and charged.

1nplw53,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nplw53,Chocolate Sourdough with Mixed Nuts,"This is my second loaf made with my new starter! I named her glu-Tina and she is doing a great job. 

This loaf is definitely denser than the last plain one I made, but the flavour is insanely good. I researched a few recipes before doing it, but sort of merged a few of them to get to what sounded good to me. 

Here's what went in it: 

150g bubbly starter 
350g coffee, lukewarm 
50g Sugar 
1tsp vanilla 
50g dark rye flour 
450g bread flour 
50g cocoa powder 
10g sea salt 

Mixed it up, gave it a few stretch and folds at the beginning of Bulk fermentation, which lasted about 6-7 hours, then I shaped it which involved folding in a mixture of chopped walnuts, pecans and almonds as well as about 2/3 of a 70% dark chocolate bar I had lying around. It then proofed in a banneton for about another hour before baking at 450 in a Dutch over covered for 20 min and uncovered for 25. 

I will definitely be making this one again, but perhaps will try different inclusions as well as a longer overnight proof in the fridge. It's so good. The combination of flavors from the tangy sourdough and rich chocolate, without really being sweet is so good. I highly recommend trying a chocolate loaf!",3,1758742901.0,Breadit,0,0.71,False

Now I don't even feel rested and I feel constantly tired. I'd be sleeping like 9-10 hours, wake up, even have a really strong coffee and 1-2 hours later my eyelids are heavy and I'm sleepy again. After coming back from work I would immediately go to sleep again for like 3-4 hours because I'd be too tired to do anything else.

But here’s the thing—it’s not just throwing up a few screens. Size matters, layout matters, and the design should feel like part of the house instead of some random add-on. Materials make a big difference too. Wood looks amazing but needs upkeep. Aluminum is tough. Vinyl is easy to clean. Even the type of screen matters—fiberglass, aluminum, solar, high-vis.

And honestly, contractors can save you headaches. Permits, codes, foundations, roofing…all the boring-but-important stuff. Doing it right means fewer repairs later and a porch that lasts.

The fun part comes after: deciding how to use it. Some people make it a lounge. Others turn it into an outdoor dining room or even a bug-free playroom for kids. I’ve even seen porches with fans, lights, and fireplaces that basically become the best room in the house.

Restaurant? Check. Natural history museum on a Sunday? Check. Coffee? A drink at a low-key piano bar? Grabbing an ice cream cone? Stroll through the park over lunch? 

All fine.

Now, by contrast, some guys want to take a date to a whiskey tasting festival that smells like manure because it's on a farm. The ground is two inches deep in mud with bees all over because they're attracted to the products of fermentation. And the only place to pee is, god forbid, a portapotty. I'm afraid that's not my idea of a good date, no matter how good the whiskey is. How can I even taste it? The smell of shit, animal and human, is clogging up my olfactory receptors. 

In other news: Music festivals. Now, there is a time and a place for this, but if your favorite band is playing there and you're desperate for company, I recommend you wait until the next weekend - the need for her to use a portapotty means this is not a good date. And she's probably not as crazy about that particular lineup anyway.

In a major step down even from that, I've even had dudes suggest that the women on a group trip all huddle up to go pee on one side of the car, and the men use the other. I am not dropping trou in front of a gaggle of other women, especially if one of them is your sister.

Major exceptions to this rule are short hikes where good planning can avoid the situation entirely, and anything so spectacularly scenic or once-in-a-lifetime that I'm willing to make an exception because there's no other way, and I'd better like you a LOT. Those are more situations for LTR's anyway.

1. if I have to fix the end of the spring to something else or if it's supposed to just be floating in open space?

2. out of interest - what does the spring even do?

3. is there anything I can do to prevent the same thing from happening again? Do I need to buy a replacement cause the plastic thingy might be fatigued?

Which means I have 8 hours of classes all in one go, with maybe 2-3 ten minute breaks. Scientifically as well as my own experience, this is ridiculous. Humans focus well for like 30-45 minutes and then need breaks. We max out after a certain while. Thats why the eight hour work day is pointless, we actually cant do it. So I have these 8 hour days where I'm mentally exhausted and physically tired just by showing up on time, and its a waste. Then I have to go back and study what I missed while in class trying to take notes, when I was supposed to be studying to get ahead or re-practice the information. The end result is that im always physically tired, emotionally tired, and what could have taken 6 hours in 2 hour chunks separated by some time, is instead taking 18 hours and I still didn't process it correctly.

I'm so bogged down by how many hours of work im being given I must sacrifice more time, more physical health and more mental energy just to re do the work. Which is like a ball rolling down hill, it gathers momentum. Over working one week means i have to spend even more time catching up the next, and on and on. Now I show up tired to class from all the studying and stress and its even more unproductive. I dont know how to adapt to something which is designed in an unscientific (and frankly unserious) manner. I'd like some advice. After the sixth hour and my third cup of coffee I am literally just staring off into space.

Regardless: Colleges and Universities need to start fucking adapting to the insights about human productivity that science has unpacked for us. We shouldnt' be studying like its 1950 anymore. I'm literally wasting time I could be studying by being in class ""studying"". Am I supposed to skip class at this point just to take a break so I can come back and actually study?

This morning you were randomly on my mind.

I've been so lost in thought over people from my past, but I think you popped up because I always see you at the top of my Contact List on Facebook even though we aren't connected anymore and haven't talked there in almost 10 years.

It's kind of weird, because I don't even look at our old messages. I did save them, though, even though I deleted almost all my other old messages. Does this mean that you are keeping tabs on me? I think you are, and I don't mind if you are.

Anyway, I was recalling all the times you were there for me - rescuing me by changing my flat tire, or buying a fishing pole in order to open my window so we could get out the keys I locked in my car, taking that class with me on your day off even though it wasn't something you'd ever do on your own, going to the doctor's with me to support me, getting my dog a kennel, driving me to the train station, taking me to breakfast, etc.

You did so much for me, and you didn't even have ulterior motives of being with me. You just liked to spend time together. You'd sit and drink coffee with me for 4 hours sometimes, just talking. And you consoled me when I was crying over my ex boyfriend who was getting married.

I did feel your love, though. And I understand your communication. You told me, in so many words, that it was too much of a risk for us to be together in case it doesn't work out and you lose me. You said ""Even if I love her with my whole heart,"" The way you looked into my eyes told me you were saying this to me. I loved you too even though I played dumb and acted like I didn't know who you were talking about. I hope you know I played dumb, in your heart, because I felt I had to.

I remember telling you that even though I don't believe in soulmates, that you and I probably are. You actually agreed. I still have that message, though I don't listen to it, but I remember the nervousness in your voice and how you laughed a little.

I remember confronting you that other day when we were alone. I asked you what was going on between us and you said ""I don't know."" Then after taking a break from you for a while, you told me at my birthday lunch that ""I say I don't know when I don't want to answer."" That's when you said that your new partner was scared that you were going to cheat on her with me. You laughed, and I didn't.

Anyway, I should have kept my opinions to myself and stayed out of everything, but I don't regret telling you that I loved you. You said you loved me too, many times, although which way was not spelled out and doesn't even matter. Because I felt it coming from you. That's what counts.

You were one of the warmest men I've ever known. You had your jerk moments, too, but you were sweet and thoughtful, and so was your family. My mom was shocked when she saw you in the supermarket and you went and hugged her and told her you were my friend. I feel bad that my mom was kind of freaked out. I think she hurt your feelings when she forgot who you were and reacted in a surprised way. Sorry about that.

I remember when we played pool and you put your arms around me from the back. It was a bit awkward because our partners were standing there watching us spend almost the whole night together. They didn't say anything, surprisingly, but they would have had a right to. Your ex girlfriend told me after you broke up that she sensed you had feelings for me and that she knows you really respected me. I keep those sentiments in the back of my mind, and I know that they are true.

Probably the most meaningful memory between us is the time right before you ran off to elope with the woman you met online.  We were standing outside Red Robin after having lunch and I was talking about something I can't remember now. You had the saddest look on your face that I ever saw. Suddenly, I could read your mind. I couldn't read the exact words you were saying, but the sentiment was clear. You were saying. ""Please forgive me for what I'm going to do. I'm going to hurt you, and I'm so sorry. I will miss you, and I will always love you.""

I know that sounds crazy, and it's never happened before, but I KNEW what your eyes were telling me. I even told your friend about it and told him that you were going to do something that weekend. I WAS RIGHT. You ran off and married that woman you met online, and we didn't find out until later. You acted like she put a gun to your head and forced you to do it, but you did choose to do it. I don't blame you I guess, if that's what you thought you had to do. I still remember that email that I believe your new wife had you write to me when we got in a fight. It said ""I hope someday you can love the one you're with."" That was kind of telling. I mean the song goes, ""If you can't be with the one you love...""

We stopped talking after arguing 6 or 7 years ago. But 3 years ago, you gave me a ""thumbs up"" on my Facebook post even though we are no longer friends there. I was shocked since you usually seem to hold grudges against people in general. But it meant a lot to me to know that you still read my posts and that you would let me know in that way that you still care. I also anonymously send Christmas cards to your parents' house from time to time. I know that you know it is me. You know I will always love you. You were one of my closest friends.

I don't bother to look at your social media anymore. You know I don't like the woman you married, and I'm sorry that bothered you. I should have been more supportive. She just seems mean-spirited. But at least from what you've shown, you are very happy together, although I can't really imagine how. I know it's not my business. We all do whatever we need to do. I did it. Others do it. We all do it.

I have no hard feelings, and I don't think you do either. I know I accused you of being a lying jerk. I wish I could apologize for being so harsh to you. You were no more deceptive than me. Or at least if you were, I understand why.

I just felt like getting this out.

You were my emotional soulmate. I had an intellectual soulmate too. If I were to put the emotional ease I felt with you with the intellectual connection and physical chemistry I felt with her, I would have the perfect mate for me.

I think she was ""the one,"" but you were special in your way. I know I was special to you too.",1,1758741799.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,1.0,False

This year will be larger and include a tent outside! The regular olympic air rifle range (for adults) will be open on both days, and nerf rifle range (for kids) will be open on Sunday with plenty of prizes to win (lots of very cool biersteins and other prizes). Multiple bands, as well as traditional German dancers, etc, etc. Parking was not a problem last year, but with the tent this year it will be more limited.

I have ended my tenancy 50 days before end of contract

Initially LL asked for 1300 pounds remarketing fees, and then asked me to vacate my property for a prospective tenant. 

After I have vacated the property, handed the keys, the LL claimed the prospective tenant no longer wants the property and therefore it remains vacant, and have asked me to pay the remaining rent (1500 pcm) for a very small flat in london. 

They have already deducted 900 pounds from my deposit for a deep clean + coffee stain on a mattress

Does that sound reasonable, I feel this is a rip off.

2.5.1. To pay for any reasonable costs or damage suffered by the Landlord or the Landlord’s Agent because 
of any breach on the part of the Tenant of any part of this agreement.

2.1.4. That in the case of a breach of the terms of the tenancy by the Tenant, a reasonable administration

I need some input on a couple things.

1) how are you measuring temperature? Is the built in temperature measuring the temp of the air or the beans in the chamber? Or is it a simple average of both? I tried using a temp gun but it never registered over about 350°.

2) how are you running the cooling cycle? When I selected “cool” I didn’t notice an appreciable change. It did not run the fan at a high speed so I changed it to max fan.

I did not take good notes about all my settings through the roast. I basically tried to follow the SM’s guide. Total roast time with cooling was about 17 minutes. ",3,1758741489.0,roasting,8,1.0,False

(note: I have not used cases on my last three iPhones, including the iPhone 17.)

Getting home I was looking at the iPhone 17 and noticed my first scratch. 😖 — minor, I grant you, but disappointing on the second day I’ve used it. — investigating further I find that it aligns with my folding iPhone stand. CRAP! 💩

I pulled out my iPhone 15 Pro Max and inspected the back. There are NO scratches on the back anywhere, much less where the stand would have touched it on a daily basis over the last two years. 

While, it’s true that my iPhone stand has lost its protective rubber bumper, my iPhone 15 Pro Max never suffered any damage while the ceramic insert on my new 17 immediately was scarred in a few minutes . — I could replace the rubber bumper, but I think I’ll just order a new stand that connects to the phone with MagSafe.

There’s nothing wrong with any of this, but it’s a customer’s right to make an informed decision about whether or not to support the business when the business is choosing sides politically. Continually censoring posts pointing this out looks a whole heck of a lot like political censorship. If a business doesn’t want people know where they stand politically, then they shouldn’t be using their business account and business itself to promote political parties and ideas. Completely disappointing that the mods of this subreddit are censoring people simply speaking about this. Choosing whether or not to support a business is a form of free speech.

I'm thinking something quite informal - like literally a group of 4-5 people meeting to have tea, coffee, and snacks and having a chat. 

I have a good support system and community around me and people that care. It's also challenging as people continue to go about their lives and death can be super awkward and uncomfortable for people to talk about unless they've been through it themselves. So, I'm looking to connect with other folks to have a consistent space for grief and to find community.

1npl7w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1npl7w1/explore_the_best_overtherange_microwave_samsung/,Explore the Best Over-the-Range Microwave Samsung Delivers,"The Samsung ME11A7510DS microwave oven has been a constant in my kitchen for quite a while now. It’s sleek, stainless steel design immediately drew me in; it’s understated yet refined. This isn’t just a microwave; it’s like a compact, hidden hero crafted to blend seamlessly into a modern kitchen. From the moment I unboxed it, its low-profile design grabbed my attention, fitting neatly above the range, giving my kitchen a clutter-free look. With features like Wi-Fi and voice control, I was ready to test whether this microwave could provide the futuristic convenience it promised or just add unnecessary complexity to my life.

**Design That Fits Anywhere**  
Its 1.1 cubic foot capacity might sound small to some, but in practice, it's ideal for an urban kitchen where saving counter space is a priority. At just 29 x 19 x 9 inches and weighing 62 pounds, this microwave strikes a delicate balance between practicality and compactness. The exterior has a fingerprint-resistant stainless steel finish, something I appreciated deeply, especially since I have a curious toddler who shares my love for pressing buttons. Surprisingly, those smudges stay minimal. Its SLIM design, as they call it, isn’t just a buzzword—this low-profile gem boasts a perfect wall-hugging setup while still being highly functional.

**Performance and Features**  
Once installed, I couldn’t help but admire its smooth operation. With 10 power levels powered by 1000 watts of energy, cooking or reheating feels effortless. From warming leftovers to defrosting frozen goods, this microwave covered all bases. The auto defrost function is particularly noteworthy—no more dancing around trying to guess defrost times for various ingredients. The built-in turntable ensures that my food heats evenly every time, and trust me, there's no greater surprise than biting into a hot burrito that’s cold in the center—something this microwave avoids entirely.  

[Check Samsung ME11A7510DS price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b09yn1dgq1/)

**Ventilation That Makes A Difference**  
Hood ventilation isn’t something I thought about much before this microwave, but let me tell you, having 400 CFM hood ventilation with dual wide grease filters makes a world of difference. Cooking bacon on my stovetop no longer means leaving the house smelling like a diner for days. It efficiently traps grease and airborne particles, leaving the air surprisingly breathable. This is especially useful since its design makes it a perfect over-the-range option, directly addressing odors and particles as they rise.

**Connectivity for Modern Living**  
The Wi-Fi and voice control features were, admittedly, something I approached with skepticism. Setting it up with my smart home system was straightforward, and soon enough, I was telling Alexa to heat my coffee while I was busy responding to emails. While not an essential feature for every user, the convenience of voice control has definitely won me over. It removes yet another layer of effort from multitasking in the kitchen.  

**Strengths**  
- Compact yet functional design suitable for small kitchens  
- Fingerprint-resistant finish that keeps it looking pristine  
- Strong ventilation system that effectively traps grease  
- Wi-Fi and voice control for added convenience  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The interior, made of ceramic enamel, while durable, seemed a bit harder to clean compared to some competitors with stainless steel interiors.  
- Its 1.1 cubic feet capacity, although enough for my needs, might feel inadequate for larger families or bulk cooking.  
- The installation may require professional help due to its over-the-range setup, which might add to the overall cost.  

**Competing Brands**  
In comparison to other brands, I noticed that LG and Panasonic offer some stiff competition in this category. For example, LG often integrates inverter technology in their microwaves, providing more precise control over cooking temperatures, something I missed in this model. On the other hand, Panasonic emphasizes their spacious interiors more while maintaining a compact footprint. However, neither competitors match the aesthetic blend found in this model's stainless steel and SLIM design combination. This microwave excels in offering a perfect solution for tight kitchen spaces, pairing modern style and essential functions that other similar brands sometimes overlook.  

**True Value**  
The price feels justified given its feature-packed design and reliable performance, especially when you consider how niche its compact, over-the-range category is. While there are cheaper options on the market, they lack its advanced features like Wi-Fi control or its robust ventilating hood. If you value style, efficiency, and ease of use, this microwave could fit well into your budget without compromising on utility.

 Hello... diary? Journal thing. 

  I'm going batshit crazy without any signal here in the beautiful, wonderfully-cut-off-from-civilization mountains of Virginia. I thought I'd write about these last few days on my phone, at least give it some purpose between trips to the McDonald's down in what passes for a town. Free-ish wifi and all I gotta do to use it is buy a burger and fries.

  Pog.

  So, Diary, let me introduce myself, since this is... maybe this'll be my autobiography. Cool. Yeah, that sounds good.

  My name is Kevin. Kevin Carnk.

  I recently moved in with my gran here in the mountains. She's really nice, she does the usual old people things... baking, knitting, church, feeding the raccoons every night. I think she believes they're cats. Cats aren't supposed to drink milk though, I think. But, it makes her happy to feed the bandito kitties.

  Anyway. I should start at the beginning, at least the start of it, then I can just write as I go about my super exciting, amazingly... boring life in the mountains of Boughbow County. 

  A few weeks back, I got into an argument with my dad. Not too unusual. We often get into yelling matches that ultimately end in him throwing me a beer as we both drink in begrudging silence.

  It was as normal as any morning. I was in the living room, playing fortnite on our tv before my afternoon lectures at the local community college. 

  History 102 and Design 1. Joys, the both of them.

  So, dad stormed in, he was as pissy as he tended to be most days. He pointed at me, his face splotchy and red from his current irritation. Dad was a barrelbuilt man, big shoulders that matched his beergut easily. He was big in both ways, able to knock down an ox if he wasn't in his armchair.

  ""Get off the game. You're helpin' move your grandma."" He gruffly barked.

  I raised my brow at him, carefully setting the controller and my headset down beside my leg on the beat up couch.

  ""What'd'ya mean by that, sir? Why can't gran just stay in her house?"" I asked slowly as I tried not to see the screen as many missed notes drifted along it. 

  ""I just got off the phone with what's really startin' to feel like the last nurse willing to drive all the way up to that damn trailer. She quit. Claimed your grandmother was too much trouble. So your ass's helping me drag that old bat into a home."" Dad growled as he moved to grab something from the kitchen fridge. 

  ""We aren't throwing gran in a home, dad. She's fine in her-""

  ""Don't you talk back to me like that, boy. That woman's always been a pain in my ass... at least this way I can just be done with callin' all those nurses. That's an extra few hundred a month..."" He huffed, rubbing the temples of his head, roughly rolling wrinkles on his bald head as he did.

  ""I'll take care of her then, if you hate her so much."" I suggested, almost grumbled. ""It can't be that hard.""

  Dad actually looked surprised by my suggestion. Like the man disliked her that much, that the mere though that anyone would be remotely ok staying with her, voluntarily living with the elderly woman, was insane, unthinkable, ridiculous.

  After some choice words, a bit of shouting, it was decided that was what I was going to do. Dad was going to pay me every month, half of what he paid the nurses, but it was something. Definitely enough for groceries or a surprise bill.

  That evening, I'd called Gran to update her on the plan. She was delighted, she claimed she sure wasn't lonely, but that she would be ""muchly joyed"" to have me staying with her. I felt myself smiling a little as she talked on and on about what she'd have to bake for us to eat, how we'd have coffee on the porch every mornin' to watch the birds, to hear the ""vixens yowlin' in the evenin'.""

  Thank God, I finally had a good excuse to drop outta college too. That had always felt like a waste of my time.

  Peace out, D-Man, I'll write more later, I'm exhausted. I've straight up not been sleepin very well at night, there's mice in the walls, scratching and scrabbling. I can still hear one, scruffling, scrabbling, being a little bitch, classic mouse stuff.

I tried adding a lot more water but then it just becomes like a wash and it flows everywhere. If I then dry the brush a bit, I get these stains....

I was married to Jenna (22F), my high school sweetheart. We were together for 5 years, married for 1. She loved me fiercely and unconditionally. She was loyal, kind, and honestly too good for me — I see that now.

A few months ago, I started flirting with this barista, Ashley (23F), at the coffee shop I’d go to on my lunch break. One thing led to another and… yeah. I cheated. It wasn’t love. It wasn’t even worth it. But I did it, and eventually Jenna found out.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t cry. She just told me to pack my stuff and leave. I thought maybe I could crash with Ashley, but when I showed up at her place, she basically slammed the door in my face. Said she didn’t want to be part of any “messy divorce drama.”

Now I’m on my friend’s couch, job’s on the line because I’ve been slipping at work, and I don’t even recognize the guy I’ve become. I threw away a good woman and a stable life for a stupid fling that lasted maybe three weeks.

I’m not looking for pity — I deserve what I got. I guess I just needed to say this out loud: I messed up, big time. And now I’m starting over, completely alone.

I don’t know how to move forward. I still want love. I want to be someone worth loving again. I just don’t know how to get there from here.

1npl4p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1npl4p3/update_super_long_taper_to_combat_crazy/,Update: Super long taper to combat crazy withdrawals,"**TLDR**: I've been on a super long taper to avoid withdrawals, and 9 months later I can report that it has been quite effective despite a ""stall out"" period where I was stuck at 75% intake for a few months. I highly recommend a long taper to people who want to get off caffeine but can't make room for days/weeks of life-disrupting withdrawals. 

...

A while back I made [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ishfkp/super_long_taper_to_combat_crazy_withdrawals/)discussing my attempts at quitting caffeine, and having a lot of difficulty with extreme withdrawals while doing a ""normal"" taper (several days/weeks). My solution for this was to attempt an *extremely* long taper over the course of this whole year, and now that some time has passed I want to give an update on how its going!

I started the year with one pour over a day (20 g of coffee beans), and I'm now down to 9 g a day (late September). I initially was tapering about a 1/2 g every two weeks, but even that felt a little fast so I stalled out at 15 g a day for a few months. Once that felt stable, I was able to continue steady progress down. 

To be honest, after I ""stabilized"" at 15 g I started noticing there would be days where finishing my coffee felt like too much caffeine, and I would pour it out! I felt like I had broken through some barrier and my dependency was weakening, so I've been able to increase the speed of my taper at this point. At this rate I think I'll be down to very little or no caffeine by the end of the year. 

So far this process seems to have been worth it! It's a little annoying to be so fussy about it, but it's let me drastically reduce my side effects without disrupting my ability to work/sleep/be sane. One trick that's made this way easier is drinking half my coffee around the middle of the day so I don't peak and crash so much. I found that the crashes have the potential to be bad for me, especially if its one of the first days being on a new lower dose. 

And for anyone wondering about the logistics - I continued to use a pour over as my daily cup, but just decreased the amount of beans I put in. Once I got lower than \~14 grams I started making a double (\~26 g) and storing the second half in the fridge for the next day's coffee. I know the chemistry of pour overs can be weird if you deviate too much from the usual process, so I did this to try and keep it relatively consistent. You'll pay a (small) price in flavor/texture by doing this (especially if you don't like drinking 1 day old coffee) but for me that was well worth it to get off the stuff. After all, the whole point of this is to be DONE with coffee, so I might as well get over the fantasy of my ""perfect little morning treat"" sooner rather than later.

1npl35l,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1npl35l/i_shouldnt_have_done_it/,I shouldn’t have done it.,"Two men stood emotionless by the open pit. The freshly dug hole would soon be covered and forgotten. One of the men reached into the pocket of his black leather vest and produced a book of matches. He folded one over the outside of the book and slid it across the striker. As the match caught, he tossed the book into the pit. 

The woosh of flammable liquids igniting filled the air followed by the unmistakable smell of burning flesh. The second man produced a cell phone and pressed two buttons. Speed dialing the only number saved in the phone. My number. As I picked up, he said only “it’s done” before the line went dead. The man then tossed the phone into the flaming pit before both walked away. 

Jimmy had been my best friend through all my life. We met in kindergarten. He and I were inseparable all the way up until our junior year of high school. We did everything together. Then, in one night, that all went away. 

On my way home from football practice, I got the call that my sister had woken up. She had been raped and beaten two weeks before. Doctors had her in a medically induced coma to help with the swelling in her head. I drove like a bat out hell to the hospital. 

Once there, I walked into her room. She couldn’t lift her arms, tears streamed down her face. As I leaned down to give her frail form a hug, she whispered into my ear just one word, a name. “Jimmy.” It hit me like a ton of bricks. My best friend? The guy who slept in my room so I wouldn’t be alone after my Dad died? Jimmy did this? I was furious but if my Dad had taught me anything, he had taught me how to control my fury and how to think. 

I spent the next four years caring for my sister and plotting revenge. I had told my sister “not a word to the police, you don’t remember anything.” She had done as I asked. No arrests, no leads, the case was just as cold as my heart. Then, after a month of preparation, I struck. I used the backhoe to dig the hole in the middle of nowhere. I  watched Jimmy and figured out his patterns. I knew where he would be and when. Then, I placed the call. 

“Yeah, it’s time.”  Nothing else was said but it set things in motion. Three men, friends of my Dad, flew from Colorado to North Carolina. They rented two u-haul trucks. In one truck, they loaded up some of my dad’s belongings. His motorcycle, a few odds and ends. Then, in the other the put up a single picture of my sister. One started the drive back to Colorado taking all three of their personal cell phones away. All the two retained was some clothes and the burner cell phone I had given them. 

They kidnapped Jimmy and put him in the back of the u-haul with a picture of my sister so he knew why it was happening. They drove him out to the pit I had dug in the middle of nowhere. Then they tortured him. They pulled out his finger nails and toe nails. They smashed bones and broke his nose. Then, they tossed him, still conscious and aware, into the pit and doused him in gasoline. 

The next morning, after my sister awoke, we met in the kitchen. As I poured us coffee, I looked at her and said “it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done but nowhere near what you’ve been through. He’s been dealt with.”  My sisters tears and quiet “thank you” gave me joy but inside, I was hurting. I had killed my best friend.

1npkwmx,https://i.redd.it/yjyaijful5rf1.png,The Death of Points: Why DeFi's Incentive Programs Are Actually Pointless,"*And why that's exactly the point.*

# The Great DeFi Scam

Let me tell you a story about how DeFi betrayed its most loyal users. You spent six months farming a protocol. You studied their 847-page tokenomics whitepaper. You optimized your positions across 12 different chains. You set alarms for 3:47 AM to claim rewards at peak efficiency. You participated in governance votes where your opinion was systematically crushed by whales who bought in yesterday. And then unlock day came. 90% dump. Overnight. Your ""rewards"" became worthless pixels on a screen.

Sound familiar? It should. Because this is the DeFi incentive playbook, and it's been running the same scam for years.

# Points to Nowhere

DeFi has developed an obsession with complexity that borders on pathological. Points that lead to more points. Tokens that convert to governance rights for protocols you'll never use. Vesting schedules that guarantee you'll be dumped on by insiders who unlocked months earlier.

**It's all completely pointless.**

The dirty secret? This complexity isn't accidental. It's designed to keep you busy while real value gets extracted. While you're calculating impermanent loss on your ""permanent"" positions, the protocol founders are quietly selling their allocations. While you're decoding Discord rumors about which pools are getting rugged next, VCs are planning their next exit.

The house always wins because the house designed the game.

# The Bribery Economy

Today's DeFi isn't about innovation, it's about sophisticated bribery. Protocols bribe you to provide liquidity. Aggregators bribe you to route through them. Layer 1s bribe you to bridge assets. But here's the thing about bribes: they only work until someone stops paying.

And when the bribes stop? When do the points programs end? When do the farming rewards dry up? Everyone leaves. Because loyalty built on bribes isn't loyalty at all, it's just temporary compliance.

We've created a mercenary economy where users are programmed to jump from protocol to protocol, chasing the next 10,000% APY that will inevitably collapse into nothing. Where ""community"" means ""people temporarily farming the same worthless token.""

**This isn't sustainable. It's not even honest.**

# The Aggregator's Dilemma

DEX aggregators are particularly guilty of this theater. They promise ""the best rates"" while quietly extracting MEV. They offer governance tokens for protocols that exist solely to issue more governance tokens. They build elaborate point systems that convert to more points that might someday convert to tokens that will probably get dumped.

Meanwhile, the aggregator makes money on every trade, real money, real revenue, but somehow can't figure out how to share that with users in a straightforward way.

Why? Because straightforward doesn't create lock-in. Honesty doesn't generate artificial stickiness. Real revenue sharing doesn't allow for the elaborate extraction schemes that make founders rich while users hold bags.

**What if we stopped pretending?**

What if an aggregator just said: *We make money when you trade. Here's your cut. In real money. No strings attached.*

What if rewards were actually rewarding? What if incentives were actually aligned? What if loyalty programs actually rewarded loyalty instead of punishing it?

This isn't revolutionary thinking; it's **basic business fundamentals** that DeFi has somehow forgotten in its rush to financialize everything.

# POINTLESS: The Anti-Program

At Houdini Swap, we're launching something different. Something we're calling POINTLESS.

Not because it lacks purpose, because it lacks bullshit.

No points to track. No governance drama. No vesting schedules that benefit insiders. No tokens that promise future value while delivering present disappointment.

Just real USDC for real swaps from real revenue.

***Connect wallet. Swap privately. Earn USDC. Repeat.***

It's so pointless, it actually works.

# The $LOCK Path: Honest Capitalism

For users who want deeper alignment, we offer the $LOCK path. Hold $LOCK for higher tiers and revenue sharing. No inflation. No emissions. No promises of moon missions.

Just business fundamentals: revenue sharing and buyback programs tied to actual performance.

Higher tiers receive larger cuts of actual revenue. Buybacks happen from real profits. Incentives align because everyone wins when the business succeeds.

It's capitalism without the casino. Staking without the speculation. Rewards that reward instead of rug.

**POINTLESS** is more than a rewards program: it's a proof of concept for honest DeFi.

We're proving that aggregators can reward users without extracting value. That privacy can be profitable for everyone. That sustainable tokenomics don't require constant inflation. That transparency can be a competitive advantage instead of a liability.

This marks the beginning of honest DEX aggregation, where protocols prioritize serving users over farming them.

# The Future is Pointless

DeFi is at a crossroads. We can continue down the path of increasing complexity, elaborate extraction schemes, and sophisticated user farming. We can keep building elaborate point systems that point to nothing.

Or we can choose honesty.

We can choose to reward users with real value instead of promises. We can choose sustainable business models instead of unsustainable token inflation. We can choose to build loyalty through value delivery rather than relying on lock-up mechanisms.

The choice is clear. The path forward is obvious.

It's time to make points pointless.

And that's exactly the point.

*Ready to experience an actually honest DEX aggregation? Join the POINTLESS beta. Hold $LOCK? You're already in line.*

*The revolution will not be incentivized. It will be profitable.*

**POINTLESS Program FAQs**

1. **Why are DeFi points pointless?** Because they usually have no real value – just bragging rights that won’t buy you a coffee (or anything else).
2. **How do POINTLESS rewards work?** Simply use Houdini Swap and get paid in real USDC (crypto dollars) for it. No waiting on future tokens or imaginary points – actual money shows up in your wallet.
3. **What does Houdini Swap do?** It’s a crypto swap platform that lets you trade coins privately across different blockchains. Think of it like a magic trick for your crypto: you swap without anyone watching, Houdini-style.
4. **How can I earn POINTLESS rewards?** Just swap on Houdini Swap (especially using the private mode) and you’ll automatically earn USDC rewards. No extra steps or farming rituals – do what you normally do, and get paid for it.
5. **Where’s the money coming from?** From Houdini Swap’s own revenue. They’re sharing a slice of the fees they earn with users, so you get a cut of the action instead of them keeping it all.
6. **Do I need $LOCK (Houdini’s token)?** Nope – $LOCK isn’t required to earn POINTLESS rewards. You can enjoy the benefits without holding or staking any special tokens.
7. **What is $LOCK and why hold it?** $LOCK is Houdini Swap’s native token. Folks hold it to stake for extra perks or to support the project’s growth – basically if you want a stake in Houdini’s future (totally optional for the POINTLESS program).
8. **Why is it called “POINTLESS”?** Because there are literally *no points* involved! It’s a tongue-in-cheek dig at other programs – Houdini skipped the worthless points and went straight to rewarding you with real crypto, making the “points” part pointless.
9. **How do I join the beta?** Just sign up on Houdini Swap’s POINTLESS beta page – it’s quick and open to anyone DeFi-curious. Once you’re in, start swapping and you’ll automatically begin earning those sweet USDC rewards.
10. **Do other projects do this?** Not really. Most projects toss out speculative tokens or “maybe-someday” points, but Houdini is actually handing out stablecoins for your participation. It’s a pretty unique, no-BS approach in DeFi.
11. **What’s in it for Houdini?** More loyal users and swap volume. By rewarding you now, Houdini hopes you’ll keep coming back (and tell your friends) – it’s an investment in growing their platform while keeping users happy.
12. **How do I know it’s legit and not a magic trick?** No smoke and mirrors – you’ll literally see USDC deposited to your wallet, which is hard to fake. Plus, all transactions are on-chain (public), so anyone can verify that the payouts are real and above board.",1,1758740605.0,houdiniswap,0,1.0,False

Over the past few weeks, I’ve applied it to various projects, and it’s been an interesting journey exploring its strengths and quirks. 

**Ease of Application and Consistency**  
On my first try, its consistency surprised me. The oil is neither too thick to spread nor too runny to control. This makes it user-friendly, even for someone like me who doesn’t always follow the “pro” playbook. A small amount goes a long way, which is a huge plus when covering a sizable piece of wood. Applying it to unfinished surfaces felt liberating; I didn’t have to overthink the process. It clings to the raw wood effectively and seeps in gradually. However, it’s worth mentioning that because it’s a slow-drying oil, patience is key.

**Protection and Finish Quality**  
This product creates a rich, natural finish without altering the wood’s character. I tried it on both new wood and an antique coffee table, and the end results were fantastic in both scenarios. There’s a visible enhancement to the grain, a sort of gentle glow without appearing overly glossy. The level of water repellency it provides impressed me the most. I noticed that liquids tend to bead up on its surface rather than soaking in, an added bonus for preserving outdoor or kitchen items.

**Key Benefits**  
- Provides a natural, rich finish to furniture and antique pieces.  
- Effective water repellency and weather resistance.  
- Easy to apply and work into the wood surface.  
- Enhances the overall look without any unnecessary shine.  

**Drawbacks to Consider**  
- Slow drying time (2-4 days) might be impractical for quick projects.  
- Emits a slightly strong, natural odor which lingers initially.   
- Best applied in well-ventilated spaces to avoid discomfort.  

**Material Durability and Long-Term Effects**  
For a natural product derived from flaxseed, this oil feels robust. Based on my frequent use of wood conditioners, I can tell this is made to last on treated surfaces. Unlike some synthetic finishes that wear off during cleaning, this linseed oil holds up beautifully against daily wear and tear. Plus, its lack of additives ensures that you’re working with something non-toxic and straightforward. However, you must be diligent about applying it to raw wood as per the instructions. Forgetting this step may lead to underwhelming results.

**Product Contenders**  
I’ve tried products like boiled linseed oil in the past, which dries significantly faster, but tends to result in a slightly more artificial sheen. Competing brands also tend to include a list of additives or chemicals that I’d prefer to avoid for certain projects. In comparison, this raw linseed oil offers a clear, unpretentious formula that suits a variety of applications. Where some conditioners require multiple coats for an effective seal, this one minimizes effort with its deep penetration capabilities. Still, if speed is your priority, boiled alternatives might better suit a hurried timeline. 

**Cost Efficiency**  
This linseed oil sits perfectly on the dividing line between affordable and high-quality. While there are cheaper options on the market, they often sacrifice either purity or performance. I’ve come to trust this product because every dollar spent feels like an investment, especially given its versatility. Whether protecting furniture, refreshing outdoor wooden furniture, or even rust-proofing tools, the payoff justifies the cost. Comparatively, other brands may offer similar results, but many don’t replicate the same sense of natural, understated authenticity.

The Cuisinart 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, model DCC-1500TG, immediately catches the eye with its modern, sleek black design and compact footprint. Measuring 7.75 inches deep by 10.5 inches wide and 14.5 inches tall, it fits nicely under most kitchen cabinets without crowding the counter. The black finish coupled with its curved design makes it an excellent addition to any kitchen decor. The ergonomic carafe handle is one of my favorite design features—easy to grip, comfortable, and safe even when filled with piping hot coffee. Though the machine feels well-constructed overall, the plastic exterior might not appeal to those looking for premium metal finishes. That said, for its price range, it does blend functionality and style quite well.

**Ease of Use**  
I was pleasantly surprised by how simple the coffeemaker is to navigate, even for a groggy early-morning coffee enthusiast like me. Operating via easy-to-understand buttons, it offers a 24-hour programmable function with an LCD clock to schedule brewing cycles in advance. This morning, for example, I woke up to the serene sound of coffee brewing, which gave me a jumpstart on my busy schedule. Plus, the Brew Pause feature saved me when I urgently needed a quick cup before the full carafe had finished brewing. Cleaning, too, is straightforward, with a permanent nylon coffee filter that eliminates the need for disposable paper ones. However, while intuitive, there might be a slight learning curve with the programmable settings for those less tech-savvy.

**Performance**  
As a coffee enthusiast, I take my coffee’s taste and temperature pretty seriously, and this device largely delivers. Brewing a full pot of coffee takes about 10 minutes, producing a smooth, well-balanced flavor every time, thanks in part to the integrated charcoal water filter. Even using ordinary ground coffee, the final result tasted rich and noticeably free of any residual bitterness. The Keep Warm function ensures coffee temperatures remain consistent for up to two hours, making it a lifesaver during household breakfasts or when hosting guests. My only quibble is that the brewing process is not entirely silent, though the noise level is reasonable.

**Favorable Aspects**  
Several aspects of this coffeemaker deserve appreciation:  
- Intuitive and user-friendly programmable functions with an LCD clock.  
- Brew Pause allows for mid-brewing pours.  
- Charcoal water filter enhances the coffee’s purity and flavor.  
- Keep Warm functionality preserves heat for two full hours.  

**Critiques**  
However, a few aspects could use some attention:  
- The plastic exterior may feel less premium to some users.  
- While easy to use, the programmable settings might intimidate non-tech-savvy individuals at first.  
- Brew noise, though not overly intrusive, may still bother light sleepers.

**Energy Efficiency and Safety Features**  
The Cuisinart coffeemaker doesn’t merely focus on coffee quality but incorporates safety and convenience. I especially appreciate its auto-shutoff feature, which can be adjusted between 0 to 2 hours. Imagine brewing a pot of coffee and heading to a meeting worry-free, knowing the machine will power itself off. Its modern operation mode relies on 120 volts, keeping energy usage efficient for daily coffee drinkers like me. Still, it would’ve been nice to see additional eco-friendly settings for the more sustainability-minded.

**Competitive Options**  
In a saturated market, the product competes with models like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew and the Keurig K-Duo. Compared to Hamilton Beach’s two-way coffee maker, the Cuisinart excels with its superior warming plate and larger carafe capacity, though the Hamilton Beach edges ahead with its dual pod-and-ground coffee compatibility. As for the Keurig K-Duo, its pod functionality is a tempting alternative but comes at the cost of freshness and recurring expenses for pods. If daily brewed coffee is your preference, Cuisinart’s focus on flavor purity is tough to beat. However, its rivals may appeal more strongly based on specific user needs.

**Cost Efficiency**  
From my perspective, this coffeemaker strikes an excellent balance between affordability and performance. While you’re not necessarily paying for high-grade materials like stainless steel, what you do get is a machine loaded with thoughtful, practical features. The reusable nylon coffee filter, adjustable auto-shutoff, and robust brewing system make it incredibly cost-effective over time. Especially if daily fresh coffee is an essential part of your routine (trust me, it is for mine), the upfront investment feels worth every penny.

*Excerpted from the forthcoming book by Dr. Nikki LeToya White*

This transformative 5-part series was lovingly curated to support those navigating the deep and tender terrain of the mother wound. Rooted in somatic wisdom and spiritual clarity, each journaling prompt invites you to reconnect with your body, reclaim your voice, and rewrite inherited narratives with compassion and grace.

You all know my mother's wound experience and how I’ve used forgiveness to heal it. If you’re not familiar with my story, you can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuttyGirlLifestyle/comments/1n619hg/the_woman_who_hurt_me_and_inspired_me_the_most/).

These articles are simple, direct and staright to the point. Whether you’re just beginning your healing journey or deepening your practice, this series offers a sacred space to feel, reflect, and restore. It’s not just journaling — it’s soul work.

# Part One: Listening to the Body’s First Cry

*“Every wound has a story. Every body holds a memory.”*

Pull up a chair, love. Imagine we’re on my porch, coffee mugs warm in our hands, the sound of the morning settling around us. We’re here to talk about something tender.

The mother wound isn’t just about what happened — it’s about what the body remembers. For me, it started when my mom left me with my grandmother. She thought she was doing what was best. But I was too little to understand. All I felt was the sting of being left. My nervous system recorded it as abandonment.

That’s what I mean when I say the body cries first. Before we have language, our bodies hold onto loss, rejection, and fear. That early separation shaped me — I clung to people, I people-pleased, I numbed with food. I learned to survive, not to thrive.

Here’s where journaling comes in. Somatic journaling is about giving that first cry a voice. Not to relive the pain, but to release it.

# Journaling Practice: Finding the Cry

1. Sit quietly. Close your eyes. Put your hand on your chest. Ask yourself: *When did my body first feel abandoned?*
2. Write: *My body remembers…* and let the words spill. Don’t edit.
3. Describe the sensations — was it a knot in the stomach? A heaviness in the chest? A restless buzzing?
4. End with: *I hear you now. You are safe with me today.*

This practice helps the body stop crying alone. It teaches you how to mother yourself with presence.

The modern-day world is so fucked. Dating is broken. Tinder sucks. Pornography is rampant. Sexual innuendo is all over socail media, advertisements, and billboards. You can hardly go anywhere without seeing some form of naked woman being shoved in your face.

Retention is need NOW more than ever. Men are being called to wake up. ...Will you do it? Will you commit to being better?  
  
**There's a new thing called the ""Romance Recession""**  
Tons of young people nowadays are single, lonely, and looking for more. They are seeking a cause. THey are longing for connection. The modern world has nothing for them - and instead of standing up they are checking out.   
Staying at home. Endlessly scrolling. Watching stupid shit on internet or Netflix. 

  
I saw a recent news report: *""More than half of Gen Z spend $0 per month on dating.""* 

That's CRAZY. Think about that: most young people are spending ZERO money on anything romantic. That's gotta be unprecedented that is in the last 100 years. No dates. No flowers. Not even a coffee or old school Coke date. Every one is broke, sad, and checked out. 

**so...What are YOU going to do about it?** 

Made me think. I can complain. ok. I can notice. Ok. 

But does that actually change anything? Am I *contributing* to the betterment of society or am I just watching shit go down? What am I *doing* to help? 

So, gentlemen, I ask you today: what are YOU doing about it? Have you made the commitment to yourself?

  
**Plant the Seed: Retention is needed NOW more than ever**

Plant the seeds of your future success, TODAY (ok maybe I shouldve used a different metaphor).   
Retention is needed now more than ever. Retain that seed. Build up that energy. Expand your life-force. Go outside. Smile at strangers. Be that gregarious guy everyone needs. Make your grandma proud. Explore. Love. CREATE. What if you are the reason that someone wakes up today>?   
  
**Questions to ask yourself:** How can I help?/ What can I do to make the world a better place? What door can I hold open today? What if I am secretly a role model to the kid down the street? Is the world a better place because of Me? What tree can I plant today to provide shade for someone tomorrow?

I got my off white KBGV select in July during the prime day sale. Instantly left for travel so didn't really get to start using it until August but I'm now solidly 1.5 months into its use. I also picked up a Baratza Encore ESP Pro grinder. This is my first foray into quality drip coffee but have been using a breville barista express for espresso for the last 5 years.

**Struggles dialing in my half-pots**  
I strictly make 6 cup pots (750ml). Switch is on half-pot. I followed the Moccamaster recommendation of 41 grams of coffee, and used the Baratza recommendation of 48-54 for ""Drip brewer"". I get weak, coffee flavored water. At first I blamed the coffee, and have bought a dozen different kinds based on reddit recommendations (like Counter Culture beans at whole foods), and some quality locally roasted beans. That didn't help much so I started increasing the amount from 41g up to 45g, then started grinding finer, down to the 45 which Baratza has in the ""Aeropress range"". This helped considerably, 

* I've done third wave water
* I got moccamaster brand filters
* I fold the stupid thing as instructed
* I run a cup through to pre-heat the system
* Sometimes I do the bloom/stir thing but really I'm trying to get this thing to make good coffee *without* any intervention.

  
**Contacted Moccamaster**  
I started measuring the water temp with an instant read thermometer, as some suggest. This is difficult to assess given the way it pulses out. I mostly get readings around 185-F, with some as high as 195-F. It is supposed to be between 196-205 but I'm not truly confident that the ""instant read"" sensor has enough time to accurately read the temp from the small spits of water. I emailed Moccamaster with my concern and they assured me that with the way the machine works the water will only leave the machine if brought to boiling. They asked me to do a ""water only test brew cycle"", fill 10 cups of water (no coffee needed) and time it from pressing the switch until the water stops percolating. I came up with about 4 min. 50 sec. which they told me was excellent and shows the copper element is working well.

**Dialing in 'outside the lines'**  
When I search for answers on the internet I see a fair amount of others having the same issue, getting very weak coffee. Maybe it's the more careful approach im taking with drip coffee than I ever have before; weighing, calculating, cautiously staying within these recommended parameters of ratios and grind size. I'm finally getting better tasting coffee by going way outside these recommendations; grinding in the ""Aeropress range"" and/or going to a 1:15 ratio. But still hoping for some improvement.

**Half-pot switch**  
That being said, I also see a lot of people claiming theirs makes amazing coffee at the half pot setting without much fuss while some talk about about going way finer on half-pot. So I wonder about the supposed half-pot setting, I don't think it's as calibrated as it could be/should be. I feel like if you're going to have a half-pot setting, it should allow you to keep the same grind more or less... not have to completely change the recipe... otherwise what is the point? I don't plan on making full pots so I'm not experimenting with that but I wonder if, whatever that switch is doing to affect the speed, has some variation between machines.",4,1758740379.0,Moccamaster,18,1.0,False

I’ve never posted like this before, but tonight—after someone told my memories like they were theirs—I needed to get it out.

My brother Eli died in a car crash about a year ago and I haven’t really talked about it much to anyone. I just haven’t wanted to. 

My parents have been on my case about going to counseling. They said I’m bottling everything up and “festering”, as my mom put it. 

Eventually they presented an ultimatum: Go to therapy or pack my shit and find somewhere else to live.

I wasn’t exactly ready for that kind of independence just yet. 

Seeing as how my options for living somewhere else were next to none, I swallowed my pride and went.

And yeah, I expected it to suck because how could it not? 

A bunch of strangers bawling their eyes out into tissues while everyone sits around in awkward silence drinking bad coffee sounds like anybody’s personal hell. 

What I was not expecting was for everyone in the room to already know my backstory, more specifically…who my brother was.

You see, they knew things…personal details and memories that only I and I alone should know. 

Maybe I’m reading too much into it, after all, I’ve only been to one session, but what happened tonight is still sitting heavy in my chest.

Just…read this and tell me if I’m overreacting.



No one met my eyes when I walked in and took a seat in the only remaining cheap folding chair.

The smell of instant coffee gone stale faintly hung in the air as the bulbs of the overhead lights buzzed softly, flickering and dying every few seconds. 

Every part of that community center room grated on my nerves as I waited for the session to begin.

There were seven of us total that sat in a loose circle in tense silence, not counting the facilitator.

The facilitator was a gentle-looking woman named Jean with gray-streaked hair and a voice like chamomile tea —warm, but distant.

“Why don’t we introduce ourselves again,” Jean said. “Since we have a new face.”

They went around the room, each person giving their name and a tense sentence in quick succession.

“I’m Greg. My brother was fatally shot three times.”

“I’m Mark. My little brother died in a boating accident.”

“I’m Lillian. I lost mine to leukemia.” She smiled as if remembering something she liked. 

That’s how it went, each sentence hung in the air like ghosts—present, but weightless. 

I kept waiting for someone to joke, to make this whole thing feel normal in the slightest, but no one did.

When it was my turn, my voice trembled with emotion, but I spoke as clearly as I could.

“I lost my brother…in a car crash…”

I said the words, “He was eleven,” and immediately, I was back in that living room. 

It wasn’t supposed to be anything more than a quick drive, twenty minutes tops. I almost went, but Eli begged and told Dad that we should try the new pizza place across town on Sycamore Ave because he wanted that large pepperoni with extra ham he had seen on TV.

I remember Eli wearing that ugly yellow t-shirt with a faded cartoon dinosaur on it. It had a stain the size of a quarter by the collar and a hole under the arm. He always wore that damn thing—to bed, to the grocery store to Mr. Carter’s soccer practice, it didn’t matter.

Dad caved in and let him tag along while I stayed behind and played video games with my friends. 

It should have been me…that’s the part I can’t shake.

Jean nodded. “Thank you.” She gave that thin, polite smile people use when they want you to think you’re brave.

She started writing in the notebook in front of her, the pen dancing line after line until she caught me staring and quickly shut it.

Nobody else in the group reacted to what I had said, they simply moved on like we were reading grocery lists.

I wondered if they were all just as numb as I was to the trauma. 

Maybe that’s how this all worked. Maybe grief doesn’t fade, it just gets quieter until you forget you’re still listening.

I remember playing Xbox when my mom screamed from the kitchen. The phone slipped out of her hand and hit the floor with a quick thud. 

She didn’t have to say anything, I already knew, and it felt like my world was coming down. 

Something in the way she spoke the word “accident” broke me in half emotionally as it left her mouth. 

I just sat there motionless staring at the colors that bled into each other on the TV screen, hearing her sob into the phone as if the game would un-pause reality.

“Lucas?…Lucas?” Jean’s voice pulled me halfway back, and it took a second to register that she was saying my name.

I was still staring at my controller as it vibrated against the floor until the person to my left nudged me and I snapped back to the present.

“Yes?” I asked, trying my best to pretend I was all right.

“It’s time to share a memory, Mark is about to start.” Jean informed me with a look sharp enough to silence a scream.

The guy who nudged me introduced himself as Mark. He cleared his throat and shifted forward in his chair, the legs dragging across the floor with a shrill squeak. 

As he spoke, his fingernails tapped against his thigh — tap-tap-tap-pause-tap, over and over. I assumed it was a nervous tic, but the rhythm burrowed into my skull like it was trying to knock on something I’d forgotten.

“He had this ratty green hoodie that he wouldn’t take off for anything, not even in the summer. You would think that it was surgically attached to him or something.” He laughed nervously as his eyes met everyone else’s. “He claimed that it was ‘lucky’ and had special powers. It had this little tear under the left elbow where he wiped out on his bike from going downhill too fast.”

When Mark mentioned the hoodie, I saw the wreckage of the crash all over again. 

I remember the paramedics cutting through it with precision, the blood turning the fabric stiff, and the torn sleeve caught in the door. 

I felt myself hyperventilating as I pressed my palms against my knees and did my best to stay quiet. 

I was trying to keep it together, to be strong, but that never stops the images. It never does.

I wanted to say something, and I almost did, but by the time I caught my breath, Mark was already done.

Jean thanked him with a smile before moving on to Lillian.

Before she could speak, the sound of an incoming call interrupted the session.

The sound came from Mark’s pocket and for a few fleeting seconds, “All Apologies” by Nirvana played.

Under the chords, I could’ve sworn I heard Eli humming along, like he was sitting beside me just for a fraction of a second.

“Sorry, that was just my folks.” Mark apologized and silenced his phone. 

What seemed like such an inconsequential moment made me shiver slightly.

Nirvana was one of his favorite bands and “All Apologies” was especially important to him as it was one of the first songs he learned how to play on guitar.

My chest loosened a small bit as Lillian began speaking.

“My brother, he used to eat orange popsicles. Even during the winter season, he craved them like nothing else.” She spoke with a soft, nostalgic smile tugging at the edges of her mouth. “He had this weird habit of calling them ‘sun sticks’. I don’t know why, he just made it up one day and it stuck.”

Eli called them “sun sticks” because he said it was like holding sunshine. 

Mom kept a box in the freezer year-round because he would devour them all the time, even in winter. 

I could still see his face, his numb tongue sticking out through his orange-stained lips, laughing like brain freezes didn’t apply to him.

But then, the smell of iron hit my nostrils sharply, like blood sucked from a split lip. 

I swallowed hard, trying not to gag as the back of my throat tasted exactly the way it had that night when I inhaled the scent of metal and the lingering dust from the deployed airbags.

The car was a twisted red husk of itself in the lot. The cracks in the windshield spiderwebbed all around and the passenger side was crushed like a soda can. 

“Clover”, the fluffy, stuffed rabbit Eli won at a carnival was still in the back seat. 

I couldn’t help but notice that his blue converse shoes were missing as well. I remember asking everyone where they were, like that was the important part.

They were gone.

The passenger door was clenched shut like a fist. I remember the paramedics prying the door open, their hands slick with something bright, the hoodie snagged on the frame.

The sharp, nauseating scent of gasoline and metal hit me like punch to the gut.

Could anybody else smell this?

I glanced around but no one else seemed to notice, their faces were of a blank, neutral expression…except for Greg’s.

I thought he had dozed off in his chair, but his eyes were locked onto me. I couldn’t tell if he was trying to read something off my face or not.

I pretended not to notice, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t slightly rattle me.

These memories, they didn’t just sound familiar…they sounded like they were talking about Eli and not their loved ones.

I tried to rationalize everything in silence in the hopes that I could convince myself that maybe these were all just creepy coincidences.

Even so, I declined to share a memory of myself and Eli due to feeling uncomfortable. 

“I’m not ready yet.” was my excuse.

Thankfully, no one pressured me, but I remember Jean gave me that same soft smile from earlier, her eyes lingering on me for a second too long, like she was remembering something I hadn’t said yet.

I wasn’t entirely sure what to make of that but regardless, I started listening harder to every story told.

Every memory shared felt like I was looking into a broken mirror from different angles, but with the same pieces staring back at me.

What eats me alive isn’t that Eli died that night, it’s that I didn’t. 

Every time I close my eyes, I see the empty seat where I should’ve been, and I wonder if maybe I did die, if maybe this is just what it feels like to keep going in a life that wasn’t meant for me anymore.

That’s all I could think about as I stared at the floor.

I wasn’t sure how long I had my head down looking at the tile, but I saw a coffee stain near my chair that I hadn’t noticed before. 

It looked vaguely like a…rabbit?

I remember when mom dropped a tray of brownies on the kitchen floor while we were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV. 

He told me I nearly jumped out of my skin and ever since then, he would give me shit for being such a scaredy cat. 

That’s when Eli christened me with the nickname “Rabbit” a while back because I would always jump at loud noises. 

Seeing that coffee stain in the exact shape of a rabbit made my stomach plummet. 

This wasn’t just a stain anymore, this was something that knew the nickname Eli gave me, turning a private memory into a violation.

I told myself I was imagining things… but the longer I stared, the more it looked less like a rabbit and more like a body lying twisted on the pavement.

I glanced up in perfect silence just as everyone else did the same. It was like we’d all been given the same invisible cue that the session had concluded. 

For a second, I felt like I could feel Greg’s eyes watching me from a distance, but then, just like that, the sensation was gone.

I told myself it was nothing, but the rabbit-shaped stain wouldn’t let me go.

It shouldn’t have bothered me as much as it did.

As I was about to leave like everyone else had, I turned back to see all the empty chairs, except one. 

Mark sat there, looking down at his hands.

I had to blink twice before I realized what he was holding. 

It was a green hoodie—same color, same tear under the elbow. 

It looked just like Eli’s. 

Still damp, like it had just been pulled from the wreck…


I’m home now. I threw my clothes in the laundry and took the hottest shower I could stand, hoping that it would calm my nerves.

Unfortunately, it didn’t.

I keep telling myself I imagined it, that it wasn’t Eli’s hoodie. But if it wasn’t…then why did it have the tear under the elbow? I mean, maybe a lot of hoodies rip there. 

Maybe I just wanted it to be his. 

I don’t know anymore.

Sorry for the rambling, I know this reads like I’m just some lunatic connecting dots that aren’t there inside the wreckage of my trauma. 

Maybe that’s exactly what it is. 

But I can’t shake the feeling that something followed me home, something I can’t entirely explain or write off. 

It’s not even that I believe in ghosts or whatever—I don’t. I really don’t, but I can’t stop looking at the laundry basket in the corner because I expect to see Eli’s hoodie to be sitting in there, still wet from the accident.

Maybe everything can just be considered coincidence because Eli couldn’t have been the only one in this zip code, let alone the world who has a hoodie of that color. 

Orange popsicles can’t be all that uncommon to like and enjoy year-round. 

Nirvana is a piece of pop culture so of course their music is going to be everywhere.

But…I didn’t tell them about Eli’s hoodie, the popsicles, or that song.

They just knew somehow? 

Like “sun sticks”? That was ours. 

How can people just know memories that only you have experienced?

There’s another session next week. I think I’m going. 

Not because I want to—Christ, I really don’t.

My only reasoning for going back is that I need to understand what the hell is going on.

God, I just want my brother back. That’s all. 

If it’s him in that room, even in some fucked-up way, I don’t know if I should be terrified or grateful.

Next week, I’m going to test them. 

I’ll invent a memory about Eli on the spot, something no one else could possibly know. 

If someone else claims it happened, then I’ll know for sure. 

This isn’t just grief. 

It’s something else.

If they share another memory that was never theirs…I’ll post again.",4,1758740051.0,DarkTales,2,1.0,False
1npkmyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesignAdvice/comments/1npkmyu/help_me_maximize_space_in_my_studio_apartment/,Help me maximize space in my studio apartment !?,"I’m about to move into the smallest apartment I’ve ever lived in. I’m fine with the size but I want to get the most out of the space! I’m 29, work downtown, and while I’m not planning to host big parties, I do like having a couple of friends over. Because of that I really want a proper living room area. I can’t quite figure out how to set it up .... but I’m convinced there’s a way!

My current idea is to loft the bed and put a convertible couch underneath. I’m looking at the ""boneless"" kind that can split into two low couches or turn into a bed if I have overnight guests. I’d add a coffee table and set the TV and stand across from it. Other than that, I’d probably just bring in a metal rack for clothes since I plan to use the closet for storage.

I don’t really need a dining space since there’s a built-in counter with stools.

Any suggestions on how to arrange the place to maximize space? Is my best idea the best? Am I going to hate my life on a loft bed? lol.   
  
Also, if you’ve lived in a small studio before, I’d love any advice. My last studio was huge and basically felt like a one bedroom, so this is new territory for me lol

Just…read this and tell me if I’m overreacting.



No one met my eyes when I walked in and took a seat in the only remaining cheap folding chair.

The smell of instant coffee gone stale faintly hung in the air as the bulbs of the overhead lights buzzed softly, flickering and dying every few seconds. 

Every part of that community center room grated on my nerves as I waited for the session to begin.

There were seven of us total that sat in a loose circle in tense silence, not counting the facilitator.

The facilitator was a gentle-looking woman named Jean with gray-streaked hair and a voice like chamomile tea —warm, but distant.

“Why don’t we introduce ourselves again,” Jean said. “Since we have a new face.”

They went around the room, each person giving their name and a tense sentence in quick succession.

“I’m Greg. My brother was fatally shot three times.”

“I’m Mark. My little brother died in a boating accident.”

“I’m Lillian. I lost mine to leukemia.” She smiled as if remembering something she liked. 

That’s how it went, each sentence hung in the air like ghosts—present, but weightless. 

I kept waiting for someone to joke, to make this whole thing feel normal in the slightest, but no one did.

When it was my turn, my voice trembled with emotion, but I spoke as clearly as I could.

“I lost my brother…in a car crash…”

I said the words, “He was eleven,” and immediately, I was back in that living room. 

It wasn’t supposed to be anything more than a quick drive, twenty minutes tops. I almost went, but Eli begged and told Dad that we should try the new pizza place across town on Sycamore Ave because he wanted that large pepperoni with extra ham he had seen on TV.

I remember Eli wearing that ugly yellow t-shirt with a faded cartoon dinosaur on it. It had a stain the size of a quarter by the collar and a hole under the arm. He always wore that damn thing—to bed, to the grocery store to Mr. Carter’s soccer practice, it didn’t matter.

Dad caved in and let him tag along while I stayed behind and played video games with my friends. 

It should have been me…that’s the part I can’t shake.

Jean nodded. “Thank you.” She gave that thin, polite smile people use when they want you to think you’re brave.

She started writing in the notebook in front of her, the pen dancing line after line until she caught me staring and quickly shut it.

Nobody else in the group reacted to what I had said, they simply moved on like we were reading grocery lists.

I wondered if they were all just as numb as I was to the trauma. 

Maybe that’s how this all worked. Maybe grief doesn’t fade, it just gets quieter until you forget you’re still listening.

I remember playing Xbox when my mom screamed from the kitchen. The phone slipped out of her hand and hit the floor with a quick thud. 

She didn’t have to say anything, I already knew, and it felt like my world was coming down. 

Something in the way she spoke the word “accident” broke me in half emotionally as it left her mouth. 

I just sat there motionless staring at the colors that bled into each other on the TV screen, hearing her sob into the phone as if the game would un-pause reality.

“Lucas?…Lucas?” Jean’s voice pulled me halfway back, and it took a second to register that she was saying my name.

I was still staring at my controller as it vibrated against the floor until the person to my left nudged me and I snapped back to the present.

“Yes?” I asked, trying my best to pretend I was all right.

“It’s time to share a memory, Mark is about to start.” Jean informed me with a look sharp enough to silence a scream.

The guy who nudged me introduced himself as Mark. He cleared his throat and shifted forward in his chair, the legs dragging across the floor with a shrill squeak. 

As he spoke, his fingernails tapped against his thigh — tap-tap-tap-pause-tap, over and over. I assumed it was a nervous tic, but the rhythm burrowed into my skull like it was trying to knock on something I’d forgotten.

“He had this ratty green hoodie that he wouldn’t take off for anything, not even in the summer. You would think that it was surgically attached to him or something.” He laughed nervously as his eyes met everyone else’s. “He claimed that it was ‘lucky’ and had special powers. It had this little tear under the left elbow where he wiped out on his bike from going downhill too fast.”

When Mark mentioned the hoodie, I saw the wreckage of the crash all over again. 

I remember the paramedics cutting through it with precision, the blood turning the fabric stiff, and the torn sleeve caught in the door. 

I felt myself hyperventilating as I pressed my palms against my knees and did my best to stay quiet. 

I was trying to keep it together, to be strong, but that never stops the images. It never does.

I wanted to say something, and I almost did, but by the time I caught my breath, Mark was already done.

Jean thanked him with a smile before moving on to Lillian.

Before she could speak, the sound of an incoming call interrupted the session.

The sound came from Mark’s pocket and for a few fleeting seconds, “All Apologies” by Nirvana played.

Under the chords, I could’ve sworn I heard Eli humming along, like he was sitting beside me just for a fraction of a second.

“Sorry, that was just my folks.” Mark apologized and silenced his phone. 

What seemed like such an inconsequential moment made me shiver slightly.

Nirvana was one of his favorite bands and “All Apologies” was especially important to him as it was one of the first songs he learned how to play on guitar.

My chest loosened a small bit as Lillian began speaking.

“My brother, he used to eat orange popsicles. Even during the winter season, he craved them like nothing else.” She spoke with a soft, nostalgic smile tugging at the edges of her mouth. “He had this weird habit of calling them ‘sun sticks’. I don’t know why, he just made it up one day and it stuck.”

Eli called them “sun sticks” because he said it was like holding sunshine. 

Mom kept a box in the freezer year-round because he would devour them all the time, even in winter. 

I could still see his face, his numb tongue sticking out through his orange-stained lips, laughing like brain freezes didn’t apply to him.

But then, the smell of iron hit my nostrils sharply, like blood sucked from a split lip. 

I swallowed hard, trying not to gag as the back of my throat tasted exactly the way it had that night when I inhaled the scent of metal and the lingering dust from the deployed airbags.

The car was a twisted red husk of itself in the lot. The cracks in the windshield spiderwebbed all around and the passenger side was crushed like a soda can. 

“Clover”, the fluffy, stuffed rabbit Eli won at a carnival was still in the back seat. 

I couldn’t help but notice that his blue converse shoes were missing as well. I remember asking everyone where they were, like that was the important part.

They were gone.

The passenger door was clenched shut like a fist. I remember the paramedics prying the door open, their hands slick with something bright, the hoodie snagged on the frame.

The sharp, nauseating scent of gasoline and metal hit me like punch to the gut.

Could anybody else smell this?

I glanced around but no one else seemed to notice, their faces were of a blank, neutral expression…except for Greg’s.

I thought he had dozed off in his chair, but his eyes were locked onto me. I couldn’t tell if he was trying to read something off my face or not.

I pretended not to notice, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t slightly rattle me.

These memories, they didn’t just sound familiar…they sounded like they were talking about Eli and not their loved ones.

I tried to rationalize everything in silence in the hopes that I could convince myself that maybe these were all just creepy coincidences.

Even so, I declined to share a memory of myself and Eli due to feeling uncomfortable. 

“I’m not ready yet.” was my excuse.

Thankfully, no one pressured me, but I remember Jean gave me that same soft smile from earlier, her eyes lingering on me for a second too long, like she was remembering something I hadn’t said yet.

I wasn’t entirely sure what to make of that but regardless, I started listening harder to every story told.

Every memory shared felt like I was looking into a broken mirror from different angles, but with the same pieces staring back at me.

What eats me alive isn’t that Eli died that night, it’s that I didn’t. 

Every time I close my eyes, I see the empty seat where I should’ve been, and I wonder if maybe I did die, if maybe this is just what it feels like to keep going in a life that wasn’t meant for me anymore.

That’s all I could think about as I stared at the floor.

I wasn’t sure how long I had my head down looking at the tile, but I saw a coffee stain near my chair that I hadn’t noticed before. 

It looked vaguely like a…rabbit?

I remember when mom dropped a tray of brownies on the kitchen floor while we were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV. 

He told me I nearly jumped out of my skin and ever since then, he would give me shit for being such a scaredy cat. 

That’s when Eli christened me with the nickname “Rabbit” a while back because I would always jump at loud noises. 

Seeing that coffee stain in the exact shape of a rabbit made my stomach plummet. 

This wasn’t just a stain anymore, this was something that knew the nickname Eli gave me, turning a private memory into a violation.

I told myself I was imagining things… but the longer I stared, the more it looked less like a rabbit and more like a body lying twisted on the pavement.

I glanced up in perfect silence just as everyone else did the same. It was like we’d all been given the same invisible cue that the session had concluded. 

For a second, I felt like I could feel Greg’s eyes watching me from a distance, but then, just like that, the sensation was gone.

I told myself it was nothing, but the rabbit-shaped stain wouldn’t let me go.

It shouldn’t have bothered me as much as it did.

As I was about to leave like everyone else had, I turned back to see all the empty chairs, except one. 

Mark sat there, looking down at his hands.

I had to blink twice before I realized what he was holding. 

It was a green hoodie—same color, same tear under the elbow. 

It looked just like Eli’s. 

Still damp, like it had just been pulled from the wreck…


I’m home now. I threw my clothes in the laundry and took the hottest shower I could stand, hoping that it would calm my nerves.

Unfortunately, it didn’t.

I keep telling myself I imagined it, that it wasn’t Eli’s hoodie. But if it wasn’t…then why did it have the tear under the elbow? I mean, maybe a lot of hoodies rip there. 

Maybe I just wanted it to be his. 

I don’t know anymore.

Sorry for the rambling, I know this reads like I’m just some lunatic connecting dots that aren’t there inside the wreckage of my trauma. 

Maybe that’s exactly what it is. 

But I can’t shake the feeling that something followed me home, something I can’t entirely explain or write off. 

It’s not even that I believe in ghosts or whatever—I don’t. I really don’t, but I can’t stop looking at the laundry basket in the corner because I expect to see Eli’s hoodie to be sitting in there, still wet from the accident.

Maybe everything can just be considered coincidence because Eli couldn’t have been the only one in this zip code, let alone the world who has a hoodie of that color. 

Orange popsicles can’t be all that uncommon to like and enjoy year-round. 

Nirvana is a piece of pop culture so of course their music is going to be everywhere.

But…I didn’t tell them about Eli’s hoodie, the popsicles, or that song.

They just knew somehow? 

Like “sun sticks”? That was ours. 

How can people just know memories that only you have experienced?

There’s another session next week. I think I’m going. 

Not because I want to—Christ, I really don’t.

My only reasoning for going back is that I need to understand what the hell is going on.

God, I just want my brother back. That’s all. 

If it’s him in that room, even in some fucked-up way, I don’t know if I should be terrified or grateful.

Next week, I’m going to test them. 

I’ll invent a memory about Eli on the spot, something no one else could possibly know. 

If someone else claims it happened, then I’ll know for sure. 

This isn’t just grief. 

It’s something else.

If they share another memory that was never theirs…I’ll post again.",4,1758739960.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1npkloz,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudioApartments/comments/1npkloz/help_me_maximize_space_in_my_studio/,Help me maximize space in my studio!?,"I’m about to move into the smallest apartment I’ve ever lived in. I’m fine with the size but I want to get the most out of the space! I’m 29, work downtown, and while I’m not planning to host big parties, I do like having a couple of friends over. Because of that I really want a proper living room area. I can’t quite figure out how to set it up .... but I’m convinced there’s a way!

My current idea is to loft the bed and put a convertible couch underneath. I’m looking at the ""boneless"" kind that can split into two low couches or turn into a bed if I have overnight guests. I’d add a coffee table and set the TV and stand across from it. Other than that, I’d probably just bring in a metal rack for clothes since I plan to use the closet for storage.

I don’t really need a dining space since there’s a built-in counter with stools.

Any suggestions on how to arrange the place to maximize space? Is my best idea the best? Am I going to hate my life on a loft bed? lol.   
  
Also, if you’ve lived in a small studio before, I’d love any advice. My last studio was huge and basically felt like a one bedroom, so this is new territory for me lol

\*nothing in the photos are staying. The bed in there is a full for reference\*

My husband works at the biggest bar in in our rural area, he usually works 4 days a week, 2 mornings and 2 night shifts, Saturday was rib fest and yhe bar was busy and I had the car. Tuesday night he went out to the car to look for his screwdriver to work on a project but he came inside and put a half empty pack of cigarettes on the coffee table, he then explained he had been smoking them during his last seasonal work job in the spring and told me he did few then and then said he stopped after realizing he was hurting me and our son.
Then an hour later as we were going to bed he told me that what he had previously said was a lie he told his coworker who caught him smoking on Saturday while he was at work.
He then told me what he said is the truth 
Whixh is that the bar was busy and he was stressed, he wanted to try some and  went outside to take a smoke break, he said the pack was new and that he only smoked 2, and as I said prior that the pack was half empty when he showed me the pack. I was up all night Tuesday stress cleaning because I couldn't sleep and over thinking about the fact he would smoke ciggerates behind my back.  I don't know how to feel about it since neither of us are into smoking or usage of any type of things like that, and don't know if I can trust him after he told me the first time he claimed he did it then said it was a lie then told me that it was only Saturday with half the pack missing(he said he threw them away intending to throw the whole pack away)

1npkk0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1npkk0s/personal_experiences_with_rsd/,Personal Experiences with RSD?,"Wondering if anyone has struggled with RSD (Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria, common with ADHD) in the workplace specifically. I feel a strong push and pull with being professional but also being personable and social. Part of that is going against my anxious habits and trying to be more socially involved.

But, I am really struggling with this.

I am in a small office, there are only 10 of us. There are two women my age that I have tried to become friendly with, but it seems very one-sided.

One is polite, but I get this feeling whenever I chat with her that I am bothering her, that she isn't interested in chatting with me. She's close with the other woman. I hear them chat pleasantly, laughing several times a day. They always get lunch together, and they frequently get coffee together outside of the office. I was invited a few times, only when others from the office were included, never in a situation where it was the 3 of us. And I've also tried to initiate coffee with them, or lunch. It could simply be that they prefer to be a duo.

One of them is leaving the office to pursue higher education. Her last day is next week. On Monday I asked if she and the other woman would want to get coffee before the last day, to which they both declined, saying they were too busy. But they went out to coffee yesterday, and today together. As ridiculous as it sounds, it really hurt seeing them both holding coffee cups from the favored local spot.

That's totally their prerogative, I can't make people like me or be my friend, I recognize this, but it still hurts. Rationally, I know that I should just accept the situation and move on, but I am human, and emotional, and sensitive. So, the rejection still hurts.

My reaction in the face of rejection? I try to be pleasant, show no sign that it hurt me, act nonchalantly, mask. But I've been teary in my office behind a closed door, rapid fire obsessive thoughts, negative self talk about how unlikeable and awkward I am. My self esteem really takes a hit.

It's been taking a lot of coaching from my therapist and a lot of positive self-talk on a daily basis to get me to the point where I can extend an invitation, can reach out for connection, even something as simple as getting coffee together or starting a chat in the break room.

So, I'd like to know, what's your experience, and your strategy?",2,1758739835.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

It’s been years that I have expressed them outside of a journal. 

I’ve always been able to talk and retain friendships and relationships with everyone. 

But I clearly am hurting. And it’s a circumstance that we both share pain. 

The reason it hurts so much is because we don’t talk anymore. And there’s no avenue to get my feelings out or offer any hope of reconciliation. 

I should get that notion completely out of my head. 

It hurts because of the fact that I destroyed us so catastrophically. You mean a lot to me. And I’m sorry. 

I’ve had plenty of time to sit in this and I really wanted to thank you. I thought I could fix it and go back. And that was stupid and insensitive. 

I know there is no re-do button and nothing that was done can be undone. But I still want to appreciate you. 

I know what we had & it was the best when we had it. I’m, sorry it ended in that way. You’ve always made it clear where we stood & I should’ve respected that. 

Not giving you space & constantly trying to fix it pity so much pressure on you. And our situationship. I hate myself for it because it was stupid. I was young 

Sleeping next to you 
Playing a video game you would like
Seeing you smile and laugh — that was always the highlight of my day
Picking your brain (literally going to check out primate brains at your lab lol)
Watching shows and movies with you
Going to your shop and getting coffee

I get into bed most nights and I am left wishing you were next to me; so I could have my arms wrapped around you. 

Those mundane things really are the things that I’ll miss. They’re so important to the success of a relationship. 

I am grateful for you. I learned by making stupid mistakes & I’m sorry you were on the receiving end of them. I hope you were able to enjoy those days as much as I did. 

I’m now able to change for the better. And I don’t think that would’ve been possible without you. So it’s double tragic..

I was suffering and at times I thought I was doing a masterful job at disguising it. & at other times; an equally disastrous one. 

Around you, that disguise got a bit easier to drop — I ended up not needing it because I looked forward to being with you so much. 

It’s still something I still look forward to; if we’d ever meet again

I loved knowing you were close. It’s clear I wasn’t ready to give you everything

I frequented some hobby subs but mostly front page slop and bought into the lib millennial agenda, even for dating advice which was, guess what, unsuccessful. It definitely fried my brain a little and made me more antisocial, specially with all the glorifying of ""introversion"" (social anxiety).

Last year a switch flipped and I slowly realized all of this was bullshit. Finding RSP unironically helped me let go of some bad habits. I quit porn and gaming, read more books, watched more movies (consoom I know), exercised and fixed my diet, had a minor glowup and became more sociable. I now realize I'm surprisingly great at talking to people and even enjoy it.

I'm still here though, and I just feel like I haven't changed at all in 5 years in spite of all this. I'm still basically a neurotic neet and I desperately need to gain real life experience.

Anyway, while borrowing his phone so I could talk to Apple about fixing my phone, I scrolled through his messages. There was a specific innocent reason that had nothing to do with trust. But I’m not gonna use that as an excuse because I did look at his private information. Definitely a breach of trust and privacy. That part is on me. Not my usual personality. But my view is if you’re gonna look, you have to deal with the consequences. As anyone would be, I was completely caught up guard. I don’t think most of us think our significant other would do that to us. And for me, it’s actually not about the women, I’ve never even asked a question about them. I kind of don’t care. Even if the women are prettier, or smarter or anything, anything else, it has nothing to do with me. I’m confident in my own skin. But the kicker is, it’s the sneakiness of it and the effortless lying which guts me. when youthink somebody has so much integrity, it’s a letdown. It does seem like there were all coffee dates. But who knows. 

  
I would just like to get  input. Please know hateful comments. I’m really serious about knowing  thoughts on this. I’m not on the mindset that if he did this, he’s def doing other things. But obviously, it has to be taken into consideration. Let me know  you would go or stay, or if it would depend? ",1,1758739301.0,u_DryKaleidoscope7878,0,1.0,False
1npk9h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingMallorca/comments/1npk9h3/parking_ticket_high_expectations/,Parking ticket + high expectations,"We visited Majorca a few weeks ago and were pretty disappointed to be honest. Maybe (probably) we did it wrong but I want this to be a precautionary tale so other visitors don’t make the same mistakes. 
We stayed in Palma for 2 nights which we actually did enjoy. Just didn’t seem like a whole lot to do but it’s nice to walk around and we had some excellent food at Dome. 
We went to a day trip to Soller. We drove through Deia as we wanted to stop there for coffee. We could not find parking. Cars parked along the narrow roads and people hiking to get to the town. It’s way overcrowded. Soller was nice, it was more peaceful. I wasn’t blown away by the beach it was same as any other commercialized beach in my opinion. We did receive a parking ticket there and have no clue how to pay it as the ticket is in another language and there are no instructions to pay other than a QR code that doesn’t even work :) 
Don’t park in blue lines in Majorca, apparently it’s residents only parking. 
Here comes the real bad of it. We spent the next 2 nights in Cala D’or. It’s a tacky, cheap resort town where everything is white and the food is god awful. We were absolutely miserable. No charm about it, people from other countries did not welcome us Americans kindly. We went for dinner at some restaurant in Santanyí that was supposed to be so good- es moli or something. God awful. Worst meal I’ve ever had and that’s no exaggeration I cannot believe the dishes they are ok with serving customers. Disgraceful. 
We went to the Santanyi market as apparently it’s supposed to be fantastic. Produce looked great! Everything else was SHEIN or other drop shipping vendors. Truly. Nothing local, maybe 1 or 2 artists otherwise it’s all junk. 
The beaches we went to.. Cala des Moro and Cala s’alumnia were breathtaking but extremely extremelyyyy crowded. 
I wish we’d skipped Majorca to be honest which is so disappointing as we were excited for it. ",0,1758739171.0,VisitingMallorca,17,0.25,False

Between classes, work, and life, meeting people who share your interests (whether it's hitting the gym, trying new food, or just finding a study buddy) can feel like a challenge.

A classmate and I are exploring an idea for a platform designed **specifically for us** to make spontaneous, interest-based connections easier. Think of it as a dedicated tool to find people for a last-minute coffee, a gym session, or to organize a group outing.

Looking for some advice. 30F, 5’5. 

I’ve been started on some medication where the side effects of nausea and frequent vomiting have been punishing me for about 2 months now.

I’m sick multiple times a day, about 4 days out of 7, every week.

2 days ago, I vomited severely, that there was fresh blood present. The rest of the day I had about 4/5 incidents all about 2/3 hours apart of coffee ground emesis. I couldn’t keep anything down either and had epigastric pain.

My doctor seen me as an emergency as advised straight to A&E. After being seen, I’ve been give omperazole, paracetamol, anti-emetics and awaiting gastro to contact for an OP endoscopy (no idea when it’ll be). Any further issues, I’ve to bypass any other health provider and go straight to emergency again.

They suspect, not yet confirmed with endoscopy, a Mallory-Weiss tear.

I feel much better but still a little pain in my epigastric area, very fatigued and drained, and haven’t felt like eating since the incident.

I have a physical job (nurse)

My question is , what’s an appropriate rest period for this situation? I was told to get some rest and no straining (bending, pulling patients, moving heavy objects, overly active etc).

So we’re two days in to recovery (luckily this happened on my days off shift) but I’m due back to work tomorrow.

Am I more than ok to go back to work on day 3 of this diagnosis?

Thank you  for any advice or feedback, much appreciated 😊",1,1758739081.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Movie begins at 8:15PM. The fun starts at noon, when the lawn turns into a stage with an incredible lineup of local music, plus food and beverage vendors to keep you fueled throughout the day. Whether you’re hanging in the plaza, catching other films at the Challenger, or waiting for Rex Manning to make his entrance, downtown will be alive with sound, energy, and community leading up to the screening. Free and open to the public, this is your chance to experience the magic of Empire Records like never before—surrounded by music, friends, and the downtown vibe that makes Tallahassee sing. Movie Synopsis: Starring early-career performances from Liv Tyler, Renée Zellweger, and Ethan Embry, the film is a time capsule of ’90s youth culture, packed with iconic quotes, a killer soundtrack, and a whole lot of heart. Set over the course of a single chaotic day at a beloved independent record store, Empire Records follows a group of quirky, passionate employees as they fight to save their workplace from being swallowed by the corporate giant “Music Town.” Along the way, they navigate heartbreak, identity crises, and the arrival of washed-up ’80s pop star Rex Manning, whose in-store signing event becomes the catalyst for drama, revelations, and one unforgettable day. Damn the man!* 8pm

1npk1j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1npk1j0/how_am_i_not_losing_weight/,How am I not losing weight?,"It’s been about 5.5 weeks since I quit. I was consuming easily 500-1500 calories in alcohol 5-7 days a week at least over the summer. 
Plus eating way more because the alcohol increased my appetite, late night drunk quesadillas and whatnot. Went from 125 lbs to 139 over 3 months. 
Was locked in on cardio and calorie deficit before this but let myself go. Decided to finally lock back in after developing SIBO and seeing the scale, dropped alcohol, diligently counting calories, 1450 cal per day is the intake. So why do I feel like I haven’t lost any weight? Maybe a few lbs? I haven’t had a scale to check but all my old clothes are still too small. Usually weight loss is pretty fast for me if I’m locked in, why is it harder this time? I’ve lost more weight faster in the past while still drinking… 

I’m gluten and dairy free, low sulfur low fodmap, like fruit, veg, chicken, white fish, rice, potato, etc with some moderated treats occasionally. Sibo has improved lots. Taking berberine has lowered my appetite as well.
Tracking everything down to oil used, almond milk in coffee, etc. I’m not super active on steps the past week cause I’ve been busy but I’m on my feet all day, doing construction 1-2 times a week.  ",5,1758738670.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

And I’ll start shaking. Additionally, it feel like I’m on the verge of almost passing out, I never pass out but I feel like I’m about to. Over the past two month I’ve had approximately 5 or 6 of these episodes and they last anywhere from an hour to half a day. I restricted my food intake to starting with chicken and veggies, and no alcohol or caffeine only which seemed to help. I slowly started adding things back in such as dairy, little caffeine (a cup of coffee in the morning occasionally) and occasional beer. I hadn’t had a reaction in three weeks until last night. I’m wondering if maybe I have a shellfish allergy as the meal I ordered was a cajun pasta that was supposed to have shrimp but I ask for it without and possibly was still contaminated. The symptoms did not happen until about 5 hours after I ate, they gradually got worse and peaked for about 1.5 hours and then gradually got better. I’ve been to the urgent care, the ER, cardiologist and my PCP twice and all blood work and CT came back like I’m the healthiest person alive.

1npjzwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoendurance/comments/1npjzwm/half_marathon_nutrition/,Half Marathon Nutrition,"This past weekend, I ran my first half-marathon ([more info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1nn2gq2/first_half_marathon_garmin_toldeo/), if you're interested). My only goal was to finish injury free, which I did. I practiced nutrition for on long runs prior to doing this to figure out my timing. Here's what worked well for me:

Pre-race:

* 1 500 ml bottle of water with [BodyArmor Flash IV Zero Sugar + Caffeine](https://www.drinkbodyarmor.com/#/flash-iv-sticks/blue-rasperry)
* 1 14 oz cup of coffee with [chocolate LMNT](https://drinklmnt.com/products/lmnt-recharge-electrolyte-drink?variant=31703777181719)
* 1 [Ucan Super Starch Mocha Edge + Caffeine](https://ucan.co/products/mocha-edge-caffeine-energy-gels) gel (USS)

I drank the BA at about 4:30, before I left for for the race at 5. It was an hour away from my house. On the drive I drank my coffee. I made sure to hit a port-a-potty before the race started. Then I had the USS 15 minutes before the race with a few sips of water.

In race:

* I took water at every aid station. I walked through all the aid stations.
* Approximately every 4km, I took a [SaltStick ](https://aletenutrition.com/products/saltstick-caps-r)capsule (SSC).
* Approximately every 8km, I had a USS gel.

I had a running belt with loops for the USS gels, and kept the SSCs in a small container in the belt pocket. I'd get what I needed out right before each aid station, pop a capsule in my mouth and wash it down with water. When I was having both, I'd take the gel first, then the capsule with water.

Aside from walking the aid stations (which was planned), I only had to walk for a short while at mile 12. That's because the course had a giant bridge with a long incline. After I walked to the top of the bridge, I was able to pick up the pace about a full minute faster than my normal target pace, and a ""sprint"" to the finish about 100 yards out. I didn't feel exhausted at the end of the race, so I probably could have pushed myself a bit more. 

Post race:

The race entry fee included coupons for food and beer. The food available was pulled pork sandwiches with baked beans, plus there were chips, bananas, etc. I told one of the ladies I couldn't have bread, and asked if I could get some additional pulled pork. She obliged me with a heaping container full. After that, I went and got a beer. Don't worry, it was Michelob Ultra. Overall, I felt this fueling strategy worked very well.",2,1758738569.0,ketoendurance,0,1.0,False

**A Boil of Cardinals**

*Brennan’s Notebook — August 24, 1921*

Assembled by creek and rail. More men than I can number without a stand and a flag—say ten thousand by noon, red at the throat like a boil of cardinals. They come out of every cut and branch road. Some with rifles, some with hammers, some with a rail spike in a belt. More iron than shine. Faces the same gray. Dust erases particulars; the rags give them back.

Order without officers. The old ones line them by lodge and hollow. A hand goes up, a line forms. Breath goes out of a thousand chests and back again. Some of the men keep the wrong cadence—slow-five, the mine pace. You can hear it if you stand close. Their ribs take the count like a drum someone else is beating.

We step off.

Road red with clay. Heat in the weeds. Children on fences counting us like sheep. Women hand tin cups of water and say nothing. Preachers stand by with faces like they want to try a sermon on this and know it won’t stick. A boy trots the ditch with a roll of gauze around his neck like a second bandana. Men pass him without looking. Heads forward. The word is Blair.

At a siding I saw a train crew park the cars and lift their caps to no one in particular, same as men do at graves. The engineer’s eyes were wet and he didn’t wipe them. He kept one hand on the throttle like it needed steadying.

Songs begin in the second mile. A man in a derby finds “Solidarity Forever” and others take it. Not all the words right; all the beats right. Then “John Henry” to set the legs, and then church—“Shall We Gather” in a key that sits easy on a tired throat. The ones breathing wrong flinch a little when the songs move the count. It helps. You can see it help. Their shoulders let go half an inch.

Tommy Adkins marches two files over, hat brim down, rail spike in his fist like a prayer. Eyes too bright for daylight. He looks at me and it takes him a second to place the face and then he nods. “Almost,” he says without meaning to, and then shakes his head hard like to rattle a word out of his ear. I ask if he’s slept. “Don’t need it,” he says. “Don’t want it,” he adds, as if the two are the same now. He carries iron, good. He chews at his lip until a dark line shows and wipes it with the back of his hand like a man wiping rain.

Midday halt at a pasture. The ground has a give to it—wet without water. Men sit and the grass pushes against their boots like something underneath dislikes the weight and means to remember it. Tin cups ring on stones all the same note. I put a nail in my pocket because an old woman pushed it at me and said “keep this.” It warms, then cools, then warms. Might be the sun. I put it against my wrist and felt a beat that wasn’t mine. Took it away.

March again. We pass a church with white paint chalking off. A woman on the steps holds up three fingers and then two and then three again. Some of the men bow their heads as if she had blessed them. The whistles in the far ridges do the 3–2–3 after noon and no one looks up. The songs climb over it. “Hold the Fort.” You can lean on that chorus. The men with the slow-five look for it and stand a little straighter when they find it.

Late afternoon, we meet the first of Chafin’s boys on the road—pairs, neat as pins. Badges bright. They walk with the practice I saw before, breath matched, eyes not quite where your face is. The column parts around them like water around a post. No trouble. One of them turns his head and his shadow faces forward another half second. I note it and put my eyes back where they belong.

Toward dusk a plane writes itself across the sky like a pencil line, then is gone. The men do not stop. A man beside me says, “Birds don’t fly that low here,” and no one answers. He puts his hand flat on his chest and feels something and takes it away like the stove is hot.

Camp on the night—meadow below a black lip of hill.

Tents where there are tents, blankets where there are blankets, jackets where there are neither. Fires held low; the union boys pass the word about lamps. Mess is bread and onion and salt meat cut thin so there is enough. No one says the word gas but men keep their faces turned to the wind like men who have smelled a thing once and have decided how they will meet it if it comes again.

I walk the line and note the little economies of war: boots rubbed with tallow, cartridges counted by touch, a photograph in a pocket turned to the body. A red rag tied on a sleeping boy’s wrist so he will know himself if he wakes in the dark. A man lays three railroad spikes in a row at the mouth of his bedroll as if they were saints. Another hums the tonic of “Nearer, My God” under his breath not for piety but for time. The ones who don’t hum have watchers.

Past midnight the ground moves. Not much. Just enough to make the coffee slop against the tin. A swell, like a sleeper turning under the quilt. The men feel it and hold their breath and then let it go together. You can hear ten thousand chests decide not to join something. Someone starts names along the creek: first the dead, then the living, then the almost-living (children in bellies; old men who have gone thin but not gone). The sound walks the bank and comes back wearing more voices. It puts a burr under your skin and then—eases. The boys who were on the slow-five roll to their other sides and find the common count.

In the dark I write by a shielded lamp. Moths bump the glass and dust makes a haze like breath you can see. *Notes:*

 — *Men who had no appetite at dinner eat if a hymn is sung over the pot. Don’t print.*
 — *A child’s voice (someone brought a messenger too young) cuts through the carry better than a man’s; the wrong-breathers startle at the pitch.*

Last: Tommy walked the camp just before dawn like a man checking his own house for doors. He stopped at the edge and put his hand to the ground the way I saw him do on his table. “She’s turning,” he said. I asked, “Toward us or away?” He looked at me, then past me, then at the spike in his hand, and said, “Hungry,” as if that answered.

We move at first light. The red is bright when the sun takes it. Men look like themselves while the light holds and then like their fathers when the dust lifts and then like the part of the mountain that stands up and decides to go somewhere. I walk. I keep my own time with a nail in my pocket and a list of names in my mouth.

**Bring the Baby**

*Frances Adkins’s Diary — August 26, 1921*

We are camped in the pasture by the black lip of hill. Canvas shines like fish skin when the lanterns are low. The ground has a give I don’t like. My feet sink a little and don’t spring back.

Women set bread to slices and pass onions down a line. Children run until they remember not to and then stay close. We tied red rags on their wrists at dark. Ada hums “Shall We Gather,” no words. Martha counts spoons like a prayer—one, two, three, and back again.

I woke before dawn to the little roll in my belly that means the baby is turning. It pressed hard against the right and then the left as if it had found a knot and wanted it gone. I put both hands and told it I am here. I said its name though it has none yet. Names hold things to a place for a minute.

At sunup some men came back along the creek path two by two, polite as if they were coming to a quilting. Hats on, hands empty. They were ours—men who had marched out two days ago—and they wore their shapes, but nothing else wore right. Faces too smooth in the places that hold sorrow. The way they stepped—heels together as if boards under them were counting. When the light went through the tent flaps it went through them too, a little. Not enough to see trees. Enough to see that a body ought to take light different than that.

They asked for families by name like men who had practiced the list all night. “Pike,” one said in a voice like coal dust—a whisper that coats the mouth. “Justis.” The sound moved in my teeth. The children who had been running stopped where they were and went still as stumps.

Tommy came to our canvas, hat in his hand like a man asking to sit at table. Eyes right, smile right. Breath quiet and even on the five. He looked at me and then at my belly like a man looking at rain he recognizes. “Frances,” he said, and the way my name came out of him made the hair on my arms go. Warm breath, cold skin.

“Come walk,” he said. “Bring the baby. It’s easy under.” That is how he said it—soft like a bed just made. He put out his hand and it hung there in the air between us. No dirt in the lines. No shake to it. A hand like a picture.

I did not take it. I said, “Sit.” I pointed at a crate. He sat with his knees together and his spine long, like a boy at recitation. He kept his palm open on his knee like he was showing me it was empty. “Almost,” he said softly, eyes on my dress. He said it as if he were tasting the word more than speaking it.

Ada came behind me with a kettle and set it down hard enough to make the ground answer. She stood with both hands on her hips like a fence. Martha began to sing from the door, low, the shape-note way—dragging each line so it lasts—and the children took the tail of the tune without being told. “Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,” though no one said “Jehovah” at first. Just Guide me and great and hold me. The old women set the pitch and did not look at the visitors. That was wise. When you look head-on it is easier for a thing to climb in your eye.

Tommy tilted his head like he was hearing a threshing far off. The other visitors—men I knew in town and men I did not—stood at tent doors and spoke to their wives in tones like the creek under ice. “Bring them,” said one to his woman. “The little ones,” said another to his mother. “They know how,” said a third to no one. They all used the same measured breath.

Children knew not to go. No one told them that morning—it was told them long ago by grandmothers with flour on their hands. They pulled in toward the singing and put their backs to the canvas and held each other’s wrists like you do in a current. I watched Ada’s girl mouth the names along with the hymn—her own, her daddy’s, Sid Hatfield’s, boys lost in slate falls, a calf, a dog. Names mixed with “bread of heaven” until I could not tell which was which. I reckon that is the point.

Tommy leaned forward. “Frances,” he said again, sweet as summer milk and wrong as a rotten well. “It’s easier if you come now. They can take it right.” He did not say who. He did not have to. The ground pressed up into my soles like a hand.

“Eat,” I said, and put bread and salt in his palm. He brought it to his mouth and the bread went black between his teeth the way it did at home. He chewed slow and swallowed and looked for all the world like a man trying to be polite at a table when he has no hunger and no tongue for the taste. He set the rest down gentle, two crumbs stuck to his lip like soot. His shadow did not stick to the canvas.

Behind him, in the lane between tents, the dirt took marks where the visitors’ feet fell. Not prints. Lines and corners. A child pointed and Ada slapped her hand down gentle. “Don’t look,” she said, and then we all looked with our sides of the eyes and saw there were figures like in a ledger—diamonds and ribs and cross-hatch that kept their shape when the breeze should have brushed them away.

Eula’s boy started to hum the wrong thing—the five-count, the mine pace—and Ada snapped her fingers in front of his face twice and he changed keys without thinking. Good boy. The visitors shifted when the women took the chorus up a step, like men who have stepped off a moving belt and must get their feet.

Tommy reached for my belly. I took his wrist and held it in both hands. Warm. Solid. It felt like my man’s wrist. I could have put my face there and cried and been done. The baby—our baby—pushed back hard against his palm like a colt lays its ears. Tommy made a small sound I did not know he could make and then smiled too late, after the sound, like he had to remember that was the next part.

“It knows,” he said.

“Hush,” I said. Not to the baby. Not to him. To the ground.

A plane passed low. Men in the meadow looked up and did not look long. The hum along the ridge went to 3–2–3 and we leaned on the hymn until the count broke and fell.

“Bring the baby,” he said one last time. “They’re waiting.” He stood without pushing on his knees and the crate did not rock when he took his weight off it. He looked past me at the hill like a man late to work. “Almost,” he said again. Then he put his hat on his head and turned to the door. At the threshold he was a shadow and then he was not.

They went tent to tent. Some women cried. Some cursed. Some put iron on the ground between them and the visitors—horseshoes, spikes, a stove ring with the soot still on. The visitors stepped around without looking down as if their feet knew to avoid it.

At full day they were gone. The patterns in the lane held like chalk in a school sum. Boys tried to kick them out and their heels found nothing. It was as if the ground had been written on under the dirt. Lines meeting at neat angles, little diamonds chased by ribs, and everything running toward the black lip of the hill as if adding up.

The baby made a new kind of movement after. Not kick. Press. It pushed and held, pushed and held, like it was bracing itself against a wall I couldn’t see. I went to the trees and bled a little and did not tell Ada. The cloth smoked a thread when I burned it as the bulletin says. I did not like the smell. The color was too dark for how little it was.

Toward evening, the men who keep watch said they could hear talking from under the pasture, not words, just the feel of men agreeing to a count. The children lined up by themselves and sang the old camp-meeting piece with the hand claps off the beat—clap after the count, not on it—and the sound from under flattened like a worm you step on that tries to find its shape and can’t.

Tommy did not come back at dusk. I sat on the bedroll and fixed the tear in the hem of my dress and pricked my finger and the drop sat on the skin bright as a berry and then went dull. I said the names while I sewed. I said my own three times so I would know it if someone tried to take it out of my mouth. I said his. I said the baby’s nothing-name: little one, stubborn, mine.

After dark, the figures in the lane lifted slow like breath on a mirror and were gone. The ground didn’t spring back. The place where the diamonds had been was a shade darker. I stepped over it without meaning to, the way you step over graves even when you don’t see them.

I lay down and the baby slept against the side that had been fighting. I dreamed of beans sprouting from a seam and the little white roots going sideways, looking for something to hold, and I woke with my hand on my belly and my mouth saying no to nobody.

In the night, someone walked the edge of camp and did not rustle grass. The children stayed asleep. Ada did too. I kept the thread of the old tune in my head because I did not trust my throat. I will tell Ada in the morning about the bleeding. Maybe. If the baby keeps fighting, I will. If it rests, I will not worry her. We have all the worry we need.

**Mother Jones Writes**

*Letter to the Marching Miners — Delivered by Runner — August 28, 1921*

> Boys—
>
> They tell me you’re marching on Blair Mountain. They tell me the air up there hums like a church organ with the lid shut. They tell me the Company has new tricks and old cowards, and that some of you wake with coal on your tongues and no taste for bread.
>
> Listen to me.
>
> I have seen this thing in Colorado. I have seen it in Pennsylvania. I have seen it here before when your fathers stood where you stand. It wears the Company like a Sunday suit. The cuffs are stained, but it does not care. It likes the stain.
>
> It feeds on your fear and your dead and the silence you keep to be brave. It would have you believe you were born bought. That lie is its first mouth.
>
> You cannot kill a mountain. But you can starve it.
>
> You do that with your breath and your names.
>
> They plan to drive you where the ridge makes a bowl and pour the gas like cheap whiskey. If it comes, don’t lay down and don’t take the Company’s time into your lungs. Bite iron if you must to keep your own count. A nail is good. A horseshoe is better. Iron, not steel. Steel remembers the mill; iron remembers the forge, and a man with his hands on it.
>
> Wear your red so the boys know you in dust and dusk. That rag at your throat is not decoration. That is your name when faces go queer.
>
> Sing. You hear me? Sing like sinners headed home. Sing the union hymns and the church hymns and the ones your grandmothers used for putting babies to sleep. Sing till your throats rag. Their harmony is a noose; your song is a knife through it. Do not match their measure. Step after their beat if you have to. Confuse it. Split it.
>
> When the ground moves—and it will—don’t bless it and don’t curse it. Name it. Call it what it is: hunger. Then starve it. Speak out loud the names of your dead, one by one, so it has to swallow bones. Speak the living too—your wives, your little ones, the old men who kept a lamp for you when you were boys. Every name is a stone. Pack its throat with stones.
>
> If a man beside you breathes wrong—if his ribs take a stranger’s count—do not strike him. Pair him. Put a hand on his back and walk him to the song. Keep him talking. Ask him about his first mule and the time he busted a seam too wide and caught hell from the boss. Ask him about the first time he held his child. Names, boys. Keep him on his name until his breath remembers it.
>
> The Company will bring paper to preachers and tell them to pray you back to your beds. Let the preachers pray. You keep walking. God never told a man to let his children starve. He never told a woman to hush while her floorboards spoke in a stranger’s voice.
>
> Boys—planes don’t scare me. Gas don’t scare me. I’ve seen worse than both in a tent full of women after the troopers set fire at Ludlow. You keep your rags wet and your mouths shut to the Company’s rhythm, and you won’t give that old hunger a crumb.
>
> When you pass a church, tip your hat and borrow the bell if you can. A bell rung on your time makes a fine hammer.
>
> If you must run, run together. If you must fall back, fall back singing. I don’t want any quiet heroes. Quiet feeds it. Noise chokes it.
>
> Do not be ashamed of fear. Wear it like a coat you work in. Shame is another of its mouths. It swallows men whole who think they must be stone. You are not stone. You are men. You are better than stone. Stone remembers only pressure. Men remember names.
>
> Tell your boys that if they are taken, we will say them back. Tell your girls that if they hear a music under the floor, it is not for dancing. Tell your old ones that now is the time to bring out the songs they kept hidden because they made the hair stand up on children’s arms. We need that hair up now.
>
> I am an old woman. I have buried four children and one husband and more friends than I can count. The only thing I ever learned that mattered is this: you belong to each other. The Company will try to peel you apart like wire. Don’t let it. Tie yourselves with red and with names and with the breath you hold in common.
>
> When you get to that ridge, do not give them steel. Give them iron and memory. Hammer your names into the air. Strike the ground with the spikes you carried and make it ring like a skillet. Let the mountain know it has company it cannot digest.
>
> If they say “season,” say “union.” If they say “quota,” say “child.” If they say “order,” say “breath.”
>
> I have no use for pretty endings. You’ll have blood on you before the week is done, yours or a friend’s. Wash it when you can. When you can’t, don’t let it dry you quiet. You keep talking. You keep singing. You keep count of yourselves like a mother counting heads in the yard at dusk.
>
> Remember this when the light goes wrong and the shadows go long where they shouldn’t: You are not owned. The road you take is yours because your feet are on it. The voice under your feet is old; it is not God, and it is not your mother. Don’t kneel to it.
>

1npjykg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1npjykg,A no from me for the beloved attars,"I finally gave in to the hype and bought the crowd favorites choco musk and french coffee attars from Amazon. And let me tell you how disappointed I am.
(The seller has decent amount of reviews so I am hoping I did not get scammed btw)



Onto the reviews -
Choco musk 🍫- I kept seeing people compare this to dairy milk chocolate smell so I bought this and somehow now everyone is comparing this to a cupcake on my fyp... So idk if they changed the formula.... but it smells like neither.. so that was aplot twist.

This smells like a freaking Parle G biscuit and not in a good way either. It smells like that in bottle and on clothes and body as well. The projection is less that 2 hours and longevity isn't great either. For the price point I have better attars from local market so it's a 6/10.

french coffee ☕- I bought this after seeing a review compare it to kopiko but the first whiff off the bottle was closer to parachute advanced. 

On body though the first note that shows up is kopiko toffee but not the original one . If you ever had the misfortune to eat a duplicate kopiko (I have) it smells like that with an additional sharp saltiness to the coffee note.
This settles in a way that the sweetness goes away first followed by the coffee and salt and all you are left with is a coconut smell which was there since the start but was overpowered by the coffee.

Now the coconut does not smell like coconut milk sadly 😞. It has same biscuit like smell and it's closer to those coconut flavoured biscuit that are second cousins to Parle G. Which I hated growing up... so that's that . The coffee lasts for under an hour but that cloying coconut would be your best friend till death because it lasted almost the whole day on me with atleast 12 hours of projection.

Please let me know if anyone else had the same experience and confirm that I am not delulu 🙃

Since then, I have felt really good. My stomach issues, my bloating.....gone. I have lost at least 8 pounds and ""feel"" a difference. Clothes are lose. I wake up feeling thinner as odd as that sounds.  
My cravings have been starting to disappear.

So far so good is my thinking.  
What I was hoping to ask from the community here is, based on what I am eating, am I on the right path? Granted, I am very much learning on this diet and looking for as much information as I can to continue with success.

There is still a part of me that is shaking the ""conditioning"" I went through as a kid where we were told things like bacon, sausage, butter, steak, fat would kill you. The food pyramid the taught in school (what a joke now)

  
That said, I just wanted to provide a rough idea of what I have been eating these past three weeks and see if it aligns correctly, or if i should add/change adjust as needed. This is to confirm if i am on the right path and keep pushing forward.

Here are my stables:

Liquids:  
\- water (sometimes I add potassium and sea salt  
\- tea, green  
\- coffee (sometimes with heavy cream)

Food:  
\- eggs cooked in butter with cheese topped with sour cream  
\- chicken thighs with skin on  
\- chicken breasts with sous vide cooked in a lot of butter and herbs  
\- sausage, bacon, pulled pork (salt and pepper only) ribs as well  
\- ground beef, a lot, 80/20 version. I will cook with eggs and cheese sometimes  
\- steak cooked in a bit of butter, some fresh ground herbs.  
\- full fat yogurt ( i make my own with whole milk, exploring using heavy cream)  
\- will top some things with fresh cut green onions, or cook with a bit of onions and garlic  
\- just bought a big block of cream cheese to explore adding that to my list of things to eat

It looks pretty simple and I try to keep it that way and not over complicate it.

Just looking for some feedback and suggestions.

The problem is I have no clue where to begin. My mind gets overwhelmed by all the choice and I have no idea what is suitable for my current dilemma! 
I’ve heard a change in diet can help, I have been on a more healthy diet in these past few months but not seen much change skin-wise. 

I don’t drink alcohol but I’m partial to an iced coffee/ soft drinks every few days/weeks.
My hydration isn’t the best I’ll admit, I should definitely start upping my water intake. I have low iron and B12 deficiency which I’m currently on supplements for (not sure if it helps but I shall mention it anyway!) I also have ADHD? Again not sure if it’s worth mentioning but I saw it being brought up a couple times so I figured I’d say!

My flare ups happen quite sporadically. Sometimes it’s a change in mood, any mood. Sometimes it’s the weather/temperature change or after a coffee, my face feels like it’s on fire and I feel utterly miserable for hours until it calms down. I also get hormonal spots, red lumps on my chin area a week before my period.

I cannot leave the house without a light foundation at LEAST, it has utterly wrecked my confidence since my
early teens. I just want to look in the mirror and love what I’m seeing, but I can’t. 

The only products I’ve been using have been the “La Roche Posay 50+ suncream” and recently the “La Roche Posay Double Repair Face Moisturizer” The suncream has helped appearance wise, but the burning sensation remains and my skin becomes a little dry after every use. I have combination skin, oily around my nose / under my lip, but dry everywhere else.

I don’t know what a cleanser is, nor a toner. I’m completely new to it all, so please go easy on me!!🙏 
Is it worth seeking out a dermatologist for this? Any and all help is appreciated, I just want to start loving my skin.

Typically, I just use the coffee chronicler's hybrid recipe and I find that it works well for most light, washed coffees. As I begin to experiment with more processed coffees, I want to know how to get the best out of the switch BASED on a coffee's roast and processing style.

Back in the day, I used to use tetsu kasuya's 4:6 method on the v60, and really enjoyed it. I tried it again on a washed Ethiopian but felt like the CC's hybrid method on the switch just had more going for it compared the percolation-only 4:6 method. This was just one comparison so there's no way of actually knowing which one I like more. Because I have been using hybrid recipes for the past year, I wonder if I should revisit percolation-only v60 brews, or if there is something special about v60 style brews in terms of clarity for certain coffees that you just can't experience with hybrid or immersion-only.

For a long time now, I have treated the CC switch method as my endgame technique and haven't bothered to try anything different. But this has me wondering, aside from adjusting grind size, how much is there to gain by using a different brew method for different coffees? How do you approach brewing with the switch?

I have a few coffees resting right now and many on their way. Some geshas from diego bermudez roasted by hydrangea (including letty, salma), others from hydrangea including a watermelon coferment (see previous post LOL) and castillo rose tea, Honey 753JHF Finca Jurutungo, sudan rume, DAK's milky cake, yuzu crew, strawberry jelly, and ecuador, sumaq from Lineage. Honestly, the lineage roast doesn't feel as high quality and has a slight astringency, maybe it's just darker than what I like. I wonder how I should approach these coffees differently. I would love to hear if anyone else has tried these coffees or similar ones with a switch and zp6 combo, or with any other clarity-focused grinder.

I am a team leader of 5 employees and responsible for training planning. My team had a high turnover and I expect a heavy workload at the end of the year.
An employee who has been in the team for a long time tends to complete her tasks carelessly or to delegate them, which has improved somewhat recently. She demands more responsibility without actually taking it on. There are recurring conflicts over coffee breaks and vacation planning.
Special circumstances of the employee:
 * She is 30, single and has a very close bond with her parents, who live 1000 km away.
 * She travels exclusively by train, during the day, which takes 16 hours. (European country)
 * She receives an additional two days of vacation for her arrival and departure so that she can spend a full week with her family.
 *She claims to need a day to recover after the trip.
Current situation:
 * The employee asked to postpone her planned October vacation until the end of the year because she allegedly has too much to do.
 *She couldn't give any specific reasons.
 * I rejected her request and insisted that the vacation be taken in October in order to cope with the upcoming workload at the end of the year and not to put additional strain on colleagues.
 * The employee would like to extend her vacation, which includes Christmas, until January 6th.
 
My supervisor thinks I should turn a blind eye and allow her the two weeks.
However, I am of the opinion that her behavior towards the team does not justify this special treatment.

She stumbled across the road, filth-smeared and shaking, toward a diner. Lilith’s, its neon sign stuttering like moth's wings in the dark, a beacon in a world already dead.

The brown haired girl shoved through the door into a crypt of flickering fluorescents and peeling linoleum.

The bell jangled once; metallic, a scream cut short.
 
A funeral toll marking her entry into a temple of endings.

 Grease stains and cigarette burns mapped a topography of ruin, an old jukebox in the corner wheezing to life. 

The diner was heavy with the smell of meat pies and coffee gone rancid, fryer grease congealing, a faint tang of vomit and despair, a purgatory teetering on the edge of oblivion.

 The patrons were little more than dried husks attached to skeletons. A man with matted hair and black eyeliner hunched in a corner, muttering into a notebook, his pen scratching like teeth on bone. Another in a tattered suit at the counter, barking nonsense at a cook whose dead eyes stared through him, unblinking. 

 The vomit green colored walls were bathed in shadows stretching into clawing shapes. A fly buzzed through the air but she paid it no mind, the chatter of the patrons flooding the noise away.

She collapsed into a booth by the door, shrinking into the uncomfortable cracked red vinyl; her breath shallow and ragged.

It stabbed into her back, making her clutch the bloody flyer tighter.

A waiter loomed, tall, skeletal, in a stained waitress dress, gray eyes piercing like ice shards beneath his stringy dark green and black hair. His smile was a cold, jagged slash of rust. “What can I get you, hon?” His voice was a monotone dirge, a thousand hollow echoes; his notepad a prop in a play no one cared to see.

She shook her head, brown hair matted with filth. “Just… waiting for a ride,” she rasped, voice a ghost, glancing out the window, the sedan squatting across the street. Its driver’s corpse was a slumped shadow in the gore streaked haze beyond the window.

She took a moment to let herself relax, focusing on what was around her to try to block out the events of earlier that night.

The discomfort she felt in the booth she sat in. Linoleum floors with faded checkerboard tiles. A row of spinning stools at the counter. The air closer to the kitchen smelled faintly  like burnt meat soaked in grease and something sweeter underneath. Like wilted flowers left too long in water.

It was almost normal.

 Eventually that waiter walked away, his expression blank as he walked into the kitchen though the door didn’t seem to move.

In his place came yet another waiter.

Six-foot-something in patent leather heels. Tan yet pale skin. Fluttering lashes. Pink painted lips. Long pink and black hair undercut with green ombre. A pale blue waitress dress with a name tag that read ""Lilith"" A scar on his cheek glistened under contour, and his voice when he spoke was a velvet mewl dipped in honeyed wine.

“Well, well,” he purred. “Look what the devil dragged in. welcome to Lilith’s Diner, where you’ll always find what you’re lookin for, or it’ll find you” He smirked, lips twisting with knowing rot. The words, cryptic and dead, a riddle from a grave. 

Sanctuary blinked.

“Can I get another booth? This seat is broken and it's stabbing into my back” she asked, standing up. She averted her gaze, trying not to stare too long at the rhinestone choker reading SERVE in tiny letters.

“You can get whatever you want, sweetmeat,” he said, snapping his gum as he led her over to a different row of booths. “Sit. Sit. Coffee?”

“Sure.” She took the booth by the far window. The one where the blinds didn’t quite close. The fly buzzed again, thudding into the glass like it was trying to break free of its own reflection.

The waiter poured her coffee, black and still. Not steaming.

And that’s when she noticed him.

The man.

Already seated at the counter.

Four stools down.

She hadn’t seen him when she came in.

But now he was there.

Crisp black coat. Hands folded on the counter. Hair like a river down his back, skin pale as moonlight on the snow, his black eyes like wells in a forgotten grave. Lips as green as fresh poison.

She shifted, dread coiling tighter, the diner seemed to breathe as she stood in it, she shook her head free of the thoughts before they could form.

From the corner of the diner, a scratchy note cut through the grease-stale air, a voice trembling like a corpse in the wind.

“O Death… O Death… won’t you spare me over ’til another year…”

Sanctuary shivered, the words quivering along her spine as though the very walls whispered something unseen.

She looked back at him, tall and lean, pale as bleached bone, dark hair framing a gaunt face sharp as a guillotine’s edge, his trench coat a black fog that devoured the light.

He got up and walked over to sit in the booth in front of her.

“Rough night?”

She frowned. “Do I know you?”

“No.” A pause. His smile was thin, polite. Too polite. “But I know you.”

He gestured to her cup.

“You take it sweet, do you not? Four grains, four offerings. Stirred widdershins, always against the clock. Backwards. Toward the grave. As if you already knew the gods you court are not the merciful kind.”

His statement hung between them like ashes falling over a freshly burned out house.

She froze. What did he mean by, toward the grave? What was he talking about? She stared at him in confusion, but ultimately decided it too strange to ask such questions.

“…How do you know that?...”

He didn’t answer.

He just tilted his head.

Like an owl listening for the heartbeat of a shivering mouse in the grass below the dead trees.

The crossdressing waiter leaned in, chewing his pink gum with an audible pop.

“You want pie?” he asked, eyes darting between the two of them.

“Do you have cherry?” Sanctuary asked.

The waiter chuckled, deep and dirty, hair falling into his eyes. “Honey, I’ve got sins that taste like every fruit on the tree, the vine and the bush. But if you want cherry, then cherry you will receive .”

He winked. And disappeared into the kitchen, though yet again, the swinging door never moved.

Like how the clock on the wall ticked backwards, each second unspooling like a prayer said in reverse, time itself bowing to widdershins.

The man stood, striding over like a shadow given life, he slid into her booth, uninvited, his aura a frigid abyss, movements smooth as oil spilling over a cadaver. He stared, silent, his gaze flaying her, skin, muscle, soul, until his voice slithered forth, a satin funerary hymnal.

“You lost something, little fly” he said softly, his ink black eyes shining faintly in the sickly dying light of the diner.

Sanctuary gripped her mug, taking a quick drink of it to try to calm her nerves.

“What?”

“Or maybe you gave it away.”

The fly hit the window again. Once. Twice. Again. Always the same rhythm.

Suddenly, a patron walked in and above their head, a raven flew inside. The fly kept thudding against the glass, each beat in sync with the wailing voice “O Death....O Death...”

The raven swooped past, snatching the tiny creature mid-air as though honoring the song’s call. 

Sanctuary’s stomach twisted.

 It then turned its head and made her jump in shock as it cawed at her. Its wings flapped wildly before it shot back toward the still open door. 

It was as if it could tell her night had been horrific and it only wanted to make her feel worse. 

Another verse floated past ""Well I am death..."" She put a hand to her mouth as nausea flared up, she chugged a bit of her coffee to calm herself. When the nausea faded, Sanctuary caught another line of the song, ""No wealth no ruin, no silver, no gold, nothing satisfies me, but your soul..."" the unborn inside her seemed to hiss in the fluid of her womb, as if, singing along...

The man across from her had sighed as the raven cawed, though she did not catch it.

He tapped his fingers against the table.

Once. 

Twice. 

Again.

Again.

 In the same rhythm the fly had done as it smashed itself against the window. This caught her full attention as the raven flew away, as if the drumbeat of the fly was a whistle to the ears. She stared at him, his eyes, deep, unreadable voids, glinting with the cold fire of a dying star. 

His tar pit eyes swept the room, before landing back on her like a noose tightening.

A shiver clawed along her spine.

His calm was a cosmic predator’s stillness, magnetic and annihilating. His presence a weight that crushed the air from her lungs.“You can be honest with me, little fly.  After all, all wounds remember” 

Each word was a nail in her coffin, hypnotic, unfeeling,  resonating with the darkness outside.

She swallowed, throat dry as caked dust on a church pipe organ, her voice a frail musical note. “I need to get back to the club. Bitter Blood…” The plea trembled, barely audible, her flyer crinkling in her blood-sticky fist.

He leaned back, a faint smile curling his green painted lips, enigmatic, cruel. A tease revealing too many teeth, sharp and glinting like shattered, jagged, glass. “I can take you. But there is always a price to be paid” His words swung into her, a promise coated in poison, wrapped in silk.

Her skin prickled as dread sank to her marrow.

The unborn thing in her womb twitched faintly, seeming to sense him.

“What price?” she breathed, fear and desperation choking her, her voice a dying whisper in the diner’s gloom.

He didn’t answer, rising with a grace that mocked life, extending a hand. His ong fingers were pale as death, claw like nails chipped black, radiating a cold that burned like frostbite. She hesitated, her mind a storm of static and blood.

She looked out the window for a moment.

The void outside, the blood soaked sedan, the endless road, Ashriel’s taillights long devoured by the dark, offered nothing.

 Sanctuary sighed and turning back to him, she took his hand. His grip was like ice searing her flesh, she shivered,  followed him into the night. 

The diner’s bell was but a faint dying gasp as the door slammed shut, sealing her fate. 

The wind howled, a banshee’s wail caressing her skin, his grip a glacial burn as he led her to a black car, sleek and ancient. Its chrome dulled like a coffin’s edge, a chariot forged in some hellish pit. He opened the passenger door, a silent nod, and she slipped inside. The leather creaked like a snapping spine, cold and sticky with an unseen withering against her torn skin. He sat in the drivers side, turned the key, and the engine purred. A low, sinister hum, a beast rousing from a slaughter-dream.

They drove, silence a suffocating smoke clogging the air of that same burned down house that hung in the air between them. Nyxhaven’s neon veins bleeding into view, flickering signs, shattered windows, a city of ghosts and grunge stained ruin. “You didn’t tell me your name,” she murmured, voice cracking, a futile stab at tethering herself to something human.

The man in black’s dark eyes flicked to her, a glint of cosmic malice. “Names do not matter. Not where you are going, little fly” His tone was a flatline, promising nothing.  Her gut twisted in confusion but she shook her head free of it like she always did. Free of him, of reality, of the choices that led her here. 

Her only focus was finding Ashriel. 

The car slowed at a shadowed corner, outside the window, Club Bitter Blood, its neon pulse a faint, mocking smear in the distance.

“You’ve made your first offering.” His voice was old wine, soaked in the vintage of centuries.

She blinked at him.

“Who…?”

“Not yet,” he said. “But you will. You’ll know me when the pavement kisses you cold.”

His eyes were ancient. Butcher’s eyes. But there was something else…pity? No. Worse.

Understanding.

“Do you want to live? Or do you want to matter?”

His words were slithering tendrils wrapping around her very essence.

She didn’t answer.

She couldn’t.

She only stared, her belly burning, her thighs sticky, her voice gone as they drove onward.

He smiled, kind as a knife slipping into ribs could ever be kind.

“Come then. Let me walk you toward the wound.” He pulled up to Club Bitter Blood and held out a hand which she took hesitantly.

He took her hand like a father, like a prophet, like a killer.

He led her out of the car and toward the doors of Club Bitter Blood. She stumbled out, legs buckling on the cracked sidewalk, blood and filth crusting her thighs.

She followed.

Not because she trusted him.

But because the world had already ended, and he was the only thing left in it.

 Once they reached the doors, he turned, oil slick eyes gleaming, infinite and devouring. “Good luck, little fly, may the raven take you away, as peacefully as possible. But we both know that is not how this story is going to end, now don’t we?” he said, voice soft as a velvet lined coffin of amusement. His lips curled into a smile that cut sharp, final, a maw of too many teeth, each a fang dripping with the promise of murder. 

The man in black didn’t speak again.

 He didn’t need to.

She turned to thank him.

 But he was gone. 

The diner's distant, faint stuttering sign was gone from sight, far off in the Badlands.

Where once it had been a beacon, all that remained was the unbroken blackness of the dark outside the city beyond.

So too was the car gone, even the engine’s hum, close but a moment ago. Now, nothing but eerie silence. Stillness.

Only the cold gnawed her bones, and Club Bitter Blood burned ahead like a grave bleeding neon.

She was alone, abandoned, her rejection a festering wound eating her alive. 

Beneath it, a darker thing writhed, a starving parasite pulsing in her womb.

No.

Its first kill was a taste of the slaughter to come, unknown to Ashriel. 

No. 

She shook her head, as was her ritual, to cast out thoughts that were nothing more than roadblocks.

No.

Her unborn baby wasn't some monster.

Everything that happened in that car was just...a bad dream.

None of it was real.

Her baby was going to be a rosey cheeked little girl with Ashriel’s eyes and her smile.

Not a monster.

Monsters didn't exist.

 The flyer crumpled in her fist, smeared with blood and cum.

 It was her last thread to a love that was all she had. 

Even if it only existed inside her mind. 

Even if it was nothing more than a gothic lie in a world of flickering soul candles and decay.

 The club loomed in front of her, a siren call to her doom, her steps a stagger toward self-erasure in a universe that sneered at hope with a guttural, nihilistic howl. Somewhere, far away on the road, in the vast empty blackness of the night; the mysterious gaunt faced man’s laughter echoing into the neon drunk shadows around her.

 Her price was yet to be paid.",1,1758737743.0,ExtremeHorrorLit,0,1.0,False
