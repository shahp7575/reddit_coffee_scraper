My shop currently focuses on moka pots and ceramic ware, but I eventually want to add other coffee accessories as well as whitelisting coffee itself. I'm leaning into the vintage/old school aesthetic.  

My Shopify has had about 750 sessions, 3 abandoned checkouts, and 0 sales since I launched about 2 weeks ago. I can’t see what exactly is the issue: pricing, user experience, bad product, etc. I’m also running Instagram ads at $20 a day (still working on getting Meta Ads Manager up and running), which gets sessions but no conversions.

1qhievp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HSP_AuDHD_Regulation/comments/1qhievp/how_to_tend_to_your_nervous_system_when_the_us/,How to tend to your nervous system when the US government is constantly dysregulating you,"I’d be lying if I pretended that nervous system work didn’t involve the deep seated grief and rage of living inside systems that keep hurting people.

There’s a special kind of exhaustion that comes from watching harm be normalized, defended, funded, and repeated… while you’re expected to keep being productive, polite, and “well regulated.”

From an anthropological lens, this makes complete sense. Humans aren’t built to witness threat to our community at this volume, at this pace, with this little ability to intervene directly. 

Our bodies read it as danger because it IS danger. Not always to you personally in the immediate moment, but to the fabric of safety, belonging, and humanity that our nervous systems rely on. And when the state becomes the source of fear, your body can’t “logic” its way back into a calm state..

So when I feel myself getting consumed by the news, I ask myself, “what is the first thing that will help me come back to myself?” For me that’s drinking some water an I make a fancy little decaf coffee. I let my hands feel the warmth of the mug. I sit down and feel my feet on the ground.

That sounds laughably small compared to the scale of injustice, but that’s the point, I think.

 Sometimes the most radical thing is not abandoning yourself while everything hurts.

A few other things that actually help me:

\- I “shrink the horizon”, meaning, I ask: “What do I need for the next 20 minutes?” not “How do I survive the next 4 years?”

\- Do or feel something physical. A shower, a blanket, feet on the floor, a walk. Our body needs proof we’re present to feel a bit safer.

\- Reduce your social media intake… drastically. Not because you don’t care but because doomscrolling is NOT activism. It’s nervous system flooding and it’s not doing anyone good, it’s just doing you harm. You can stay informed in other ways besides socials if you need to.

\- Do one action that creates agency. You can donate, call, share resources, check on someone, sign something, create something, write something.

\- Let grief be social, you know? 

Humans metabolize pain together. Isolation is where overwhelm mutates into shutdown. As sensitive humans, we are all feeling the tense collective energy and it’s okay to be soft together, console each other, and rage together.

Yours in sensitivity solidarity,

We had gotten coffee and lunch and he ended up asking to walk around a bit afterwards because it was going well. He mentioned how good the connection was, he told me I am beautiful and commented on some physically features he noticed (not sexually, these were genuinely kind things to notice like smile and eyes) and we had two great kisses. He was vocal about wanting a second date and we planned a dinner date but he asked to reschedule because of a death in his extended family and was feeling drained, which is so valid. I totally understand that. Our communication has been weird though, before the date it was very on and off, I would forget to respond or he would. But right after out first date we talked for a few days straight. But now we are back to on and off. He will initiate the conversation but then take hours to respond or sometimes not at all. Is he just not into me and I am reading this all wrong? Or does it seem like he could genuinely just be navigating an emotional time?

I think what is throwing me most is he didn't reach out to reschedule, I asked morning of if we were still on for that evening and that's when he asked. But also totally valid reason to not be thinking about me or the date.",1,1768860504.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

While a majority of people agreed and echoed this message, some took it and directed their anger and frustration at our troops.

>They could grow a spine and refuse illegal orders.



>Everyone in the military is a trump supporter.



>Give people getting paid, treats for co-signing, and carrying out threats from our terrorists?!?!



>They can deport our neighbors with full bellies and a good night's sleep.



I will be blunt: This is frustratingly ignorant. Here are some points to set the record straight:

1. First, **service members under POTUS's orders to deploy to a domestic location isn't illegal.** The question is whether Trump can give the order at all. Sure, there's the Insurrection Act, but none of the qualifying criteria are happening. That is where the legality is. Attorneys, feel free to chime in down in the comments.
2. **Active duty personnel can't refuse a lawful order.** They could, but that would constitute insubordination, which can lead to a court-martial and a dishonorable discharge, which is comparable to a felony conviction. Even prison time is a possible punishment. The military has its own justice system and is so much stricter and harsher because our service members are expected to live up to a higher standard.
3. **Service members cannot abuse or violate anyone's constitutional rights (US citizens AND non-citizens). THAT IS A WAR CRIME!** Not to mention that it breaks their oath to uphold our Constitution, even at the cost of their lives. If one does, document it and get it out there with their rank and name. They'll be court-martialed real quick, worse than insubordination.
4. If our troops are deployed, they may assist with crowd control if things get out of hand. Now, if someone gets aggressive with a soldier, then they are usually authorized to detain them. Other than that, **they'll more than likely patrol and protect government buildings**, just as the ones in DC have been doing. **That will include the Whipple building.** This is why I made that post. My concern is people losing it, and then we not only have ICE getting aggressive with us, but also trained military personnel. Not ideal. However, as long as we stay peaceful and non-violent, not much is likely to change.
5. As for the living conditions of our troops, I doubt it'll be any different than what the DC or LA National Guard got. Those men and women were **sleeping on hard tile floors, struggling to get sufficient rack time, and eating MREs.** Now, for the record, sleeping in weird or rough places isn't usually a big deal for these guys. As an Afghanistan vet friend once told me, ""You embrace the suck."" The point is, not even close to 1-star cushy conditions.
6. Lastly, all service members are Trump supporters? Nowhere on this planet are groups of people that absolute. Sure, **some enlisted men and women may be Trump supporters, just as there are still some here in Minnesota**, despite everything that has happened. The idea is completely asinine and disrespectful. Besides, even if they were, **they have the right to, just as we have the right to hate Trump.** That's what being an American is: the freedom and autonomy over one's self, and that includes beliefs. To quote one of the seven tenets of The Satanic Temple: *""The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.""*



In closing, if troops are deployed here, please show them some empathy and compassion. **ICE agents knew what they would be doing to people; they chose this and continue to, our troops didn't.** I know for a fact that most service members and vets support our resistance. So I'm sure having to stand next to ICE agents will be an act of God in restraint and discipline for them. So be kind to our service members and stand up to anyone who gives them a hard time. If I see any troopers around and they are cool with it, I will strike up a conversation with them, even buy them a coffee or hot chocolate. **They aren't the enemy here; ICE is.**

Essentially, I had a very vivid dream about Dispatch for what I would consider a normal 8-hour sleep. Here's some key points:

(Disclaimer: I did nothing of great significance the night I had this dream, aside from playing Dispatch excessively. I fucking wish I could say I took something, like meds or edibles, but I truly had none, hence why this dream felt too fucking wild for the normal night I had prior.)

Key points of info in this Dream Verse:

• TW: Suicide and heavy mental health struggles. This dream gave me a very vivid depiction of someone's death, so just be aware of that huhu

• Robert ""Robbie"" Robertson had, not just one, but three children to disappoint as a Father and a Hero; his eldest, Robert Robertson III, and his two youngest children (who are fraternal twins) Julia ""Julie"" Robertson and James ""Jamie"" Robertson. 

• This Dream Verse decided to take on a few existing headcanons that the fandom has made, mainly that Robert is Wasian. Which also extends to Julia and Jamie. (I mention this as a visual on how to perceive them as shown in my own dream sksksk)

• Robert had to take on a more active role as a big brother and somewhat of a parent to his two younger siblings, because their Dad is a little bit shittier in this Dream Verse. Meaning, he gave Robert a lot of attention (not necessarily good attention, mostly because of the Mecha Man legacy), and neglected his youngest two in favor of that. 

• Chase is significantly a better parental figure to all three of them, and the twins considers him family, as well as a ""bonus"" big brother.

• Since Chase and Robert pretty much raised Julia and Jamie, more than Robbie ever did, the twins look up to them more than their Dad. Though, whenever Robbie did try to connect with them, they would cherish those moments but they were very far and few in between. (Some of the interactions they have with Robbie were more scarring than endearing, cue Daddy Issues)

• Robert is not only depressed and traumatized, but he has Eldest Asian Daughter Syndrome in this AU. 

• Jamie's and Julia's morality is heavily shaped by whatever important lessons Chase and Robert were able to impart onto them. Hence why they ended up in college courses that they felt would help people (Julia in Social Work and Community Development; Jamie in Computer Science because he wanted to be for Robert what Elliott used to be for their Dad, but without turning evil...and also depressed)

• The dream changes the timeline a bit, so Robert becomes Mecha Man after he turns 18. Making him a legal adult by the time his hero work starts.

• There's a 5-year age gap between him and the twins. 

• There is a bit of a Life is Strange crossover, and you'll have to read through most of this to get to it. So, if you wanna know more, don't be afraid to take about 5-7 mins of your time reading this wahaha

The dream is mainly from Julia's point of view, and it starts with Jamie's death. Growing up, Jamie and Julia relied on each other a lot, and deferred to Robert and Chase whenever it came to big things growing up. Like, choosing extracurriculars, asking to attend major milestones, etc.

While Robbie was inflicting ""tough love"" onto Robert, in preparation for being Mecha Man, Jamie and Julia would often find ways to entertain themselves that were somewhat productive and would lighten some of the load off of Robert's shoulders. That is one of the major foundations in the nature of their relationship, and would impact Jamie a lot more growing up than any of them would ever realize. 

In their childhood, Jamie was also close to ""Uncle Elliott"" and was amazed by his inventions, so much so that he saw himself doing the same for Robert when the day came that he took over as Mecha Man. This gave him purpose. Julia just went along with anything her brothers did, but between the two of them, found more importance on whatever wisdom and knowledge Robert (and sometimes Chase) would impart onto her. She didn't see herself taking up a role like Jamie, because she believed the Mecha Man legacy was very damaging to her family and she felt awful seeing their big brother being shaped into a soldier.  She knew helping people was the right thing to do, especially if they were in need, but she didn't see herself going through the lengths their Dad went through, and what Robert was being prepared to go through. 

While they did have Robert doing his best to be an emotionally supportive big brother for them, child neglect creates its own brand of issues -a different strain of daddy issues, if you will: Robert, almost dies trying to live up to the legacy; Jamie, beating himself up for pressure he created onto himself, to feel important in that legacy; Julia, picking up the pieces and doing her best to be there for her brothers the way they've been for her. This wasn't something Chase could fix either, but being around lightened the burdens each Robertson kid was carrying. 

When their Dad dies, Robert becomes his siblings legal guardian. He make sure Julia and Jamie are all set. He still avoids Chase, and his siblings try to respect this and end up avoiding him too. Even though they miss him a lot. Robert's grief and self-made (or rather Dad-made) pressure makes them worry about him, but he tries to brush it off and convince them he's fine. He maintains his responsibility as a big brother and is there for them throughout each and every single event in their lives, up until their college graduation. Jamie is excited to graduate, and finally be able to help Robert in the field, while Julia is still firm in her belief of helping people through less super heroic means -by being a community worker. 

At this point, Robert believes that it's time for him to distance himself from them. Because of how established he already is, especially as the third Mecha Man, his list of enemies has also grown significantly in number and in levels of danger. More so with him chasing Shroud in order to avenge their father. He's become paranoid, and the last thing he wants is for any villain to find out he has family he wants to protect, which makes him believe distance is the answer.

This is where it falls apart. 

Robert suddenly cutting them off causes more pain than he anticipated. Jamie feels purposeless and lost, because the person he was hoping to help the most suddenly ghosted him. Julia became extremely worried, and knowing Robert, he was doing this because he felt it was best and because he believed that he had to face whatever hardships he's met with alone. They try reaching out so many times, but they're met with unanswered calls (all of them going straight to voice mail), unseen messages, and just silence. 

It's Julia who breaks first, stating that ""if he doesn't want to talk to us, then why bother"", all of this coming from a place of concern and anger (not at being suddenly cut off, but at not being allowed to help their older brother and being there for him when he needs it). Jamie continues to reach out. The only updates they ever get about him are through news headlines either on TV or on newspaper, so at least they know he's alive. This goes on for years.  

Then, comes the big explosion. On the news headlines: ""Mecha Man, blown out of the sky,"" and other variations of the title. Jamie and Julia, who are now living apart, call each other immediately. Their hearts almost stop as soon as they see the headline, and they're not the only ones. They try contacting different hospitals that might be holding their brother at first, but then they get a call from SDN's health facility, telling them that they have Robert and that they were listed as his emergency contacts still, despite the sudden distance. They both rush to the health center, and lo and behold, they reunite with Chase. 

They're confused at first as to why he was suddenly an old man, then he explains to them the nature of his powers and how they aged him. Much like Robert in the game, they feel guilt at not keeping in touch with him and making him run so much when they were kids, but he was overall just happy to see them again. It's all bittersweet, since Robert is now in a coma that none of them know when he'll wake up from. Chase also explains that he was the one who convinced SDN to take in Robert, since it was easier to keep his hero identity a secret this way. 

Days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months, and Jamie falls deeper into a depression from his big brother's incident. He was already struggling before, ever since Robert cut himself off from them, but it got worse after the explosion. Julia's doing her best to look out for him, while visiting Robert almost daily alongside Chase. The three of them do spend time catching up, but neither Chase nor Julia realize the extent of what Jamie's feeling until the unimaginable happens. 

Jamie takes his own life, and it's Julia who finds him. 

(Note: Everything mentioned above was in flashes, and I just arranged it more chronologically. The dream genuinely starts from when Jamie dies, so imagine how I felt when I woke up, after having seen something so graphic in my own dream 😭) 

Julia is about to go on her usual hospital visit, but on this particular day, she's supposed to go with Jamie. She calls him, and he doesn't answer. She tries messaging him, but he doesn't see them. She tries several more times to reach him, but there's only silence. 

She wants to believe nothing is wrong, but her gut is telling her otherwise, and she ultimately decides to go to his place to check on him. 

When she gets to his place, she finds the door unlocked. The apartment is eerily silent, and more importantly, tidier than she last saw it. She heads straight for his room first: empty. Then, she sees his bathroom door slightly open. 

When she peeks inside, she feels her soul leave her body.

\--(This part will be more detailed about Jamie's death, so please skip until the next line break if you think this will be triggering to you)-- 

Jamie is in his bathtub, submerged in water that almost filled the tub to the brim and was now mixed with his blood. Julia is frozen where she's standing for a few seconds, but then snaps back into reality once she realizes he's still bleeding out. 

Her hands are shaking as she pulls Jamie out of the tub. Tears are streaming down her face as she softly cries 'Jamie, why? Why would you do this?' and 'You could have called me, I promise, I would've run to you'. She sees the gashes he's cut into his own skin on his left arm and decides to check for his pulse on his right. It's very faint. 

She finds something to help stop the bleeding and keep him alive until she can call for help. 

\---

With still shaking hands, she calls 9-1-1. It's almost a miracle how she manages to keep her voice steady, but it breaks towards the end when she practically begs the dispatcher to tell her what to do and 'I can't lose him, please, tell me how not to lose him.' 

He just simply tells her to stay calm while waiting for help to arrive. Minutes feel like hours, but eventually, the ambulance arrives. She lets the paramedics take over, strapping Jamie onto the stretcher and tending to his gashes. One of them asks if she's okay, and she can only give a faint nod as they tell her that because she's family, she can ride in the ambulance with them. And so she does that. 

Jamie's brought to the ICU, and there's not much Julia can do while the doctors tend to him. They ask her what happened, how long ago did he do this, what time did she find him, and a few more of the standard questions. She doesn't know who to call other than Chase because she's sure she can't handle this on her own. 

Chase arrives just in time for the doctors to tell the both of them that Jamie didn't make it, and Julia fucking collapses. 

The weight of the grief is too much, and she sobs in Chase's arms for a bit before she tries to compose herself in order to take care of the hospital paperwork. She manages to get it done with a lot of help from Chase, because Julia is sure her brain has a foot out of her skull. She doesn't feel fully present.

And then a terrifying and pain-inducing thought comes to her: ""Robert's gonna wake up with one less sibling.""

He won't even be able to attend Jamie's funeral, unless he suddenly wakes up from his coma. This almost causes her to break down again. 

After everything is settled, she visits Jamie in the morgue, and she almost throws up. This isn't how she remembers her twin. This isn't what her twin looks like. He's not this lifeless. He's always making jokes to lighten people's mood. Always warm and welcoming. He's never idle, never this still, and always looking for something to do.

Now, he is dead. He is lifeless. He is still. He is cold. 

Julia almost feels like she didn't know her brother at all, because if she did then she'd have noticed his struggles sooner and stopped it from getting to this point. She would've done something about it...and maybe that's why he didn't tell her. She feels sick again. 

The funeral happens, and both her and Jamie's friends attend. Chase is with her, holding her hand through it all. He gently escorts her to the podium where she says her eulogy, but barely registers her own words. Everything feels wrong. 

Once it's over, she visits Robert and she tells him Jamie's dead. 

""I know you're out cold, but you deserve to know our brother's gone. And I'm sorry I wasn't able to do anything to stop it. \*a long pause\* Robert...I need you to wake up. Please, just show some sort of sign that you'll wake up soon. I promise I'm not mad at you anymore, okay? I promise, so just please wake up. I already lost one brother, and I can't lose you too, so please just fucking wake up.""

No response. 

She gets up from the chair next to his bed, places a soft kiss against his forehead and just tells him to rest well. Julia doesn't turn back in time to see one of his hands ever so slightly twitch.

Weeks pass, and Chase checks up on Julia from time to time. Just to make sure she's okay ('okay' being a relative term). She's taken time off from work to grieve, but it's only caused her to become a shut-in. Every day, she's done nothing but cry, sleep, eat, shit, then rinse and repeat. Everything becomes unbearable. 

On one of the nights when she feels the ""screamingcryingbegging at the night sky"" kind of breakdown, that's when it happens. She is granted the power to time-travel, particularly, to jump into the past, rewind time. She also has the ability to see a past event through an object of great significance or one that has a particularly strong memory tied to it. Julia doesn't find out about it until the day after when she keeps accidentally going back and forth between past and present a couple of times. When she gets the hang of it, she knows immediately what to do. 

Julie uses this as an opportunity to go back and keep Jamie from dying. The heartbreaking catch is that she slowly realizes that for every successful attempt at saving Jamie, there is either an equal price paid for his life being preserved or he dies a little later through other means. This either comes fast or at a much later date. 

It comes in the form of him getting run over, getting stabbed in a mugging, of the Red Ring suddenly kidnapping him, etc. Julia goes back 72 times to try and save Jamie, but it's on the 72nd try she finally breaks. 

She goes back further than usual, as far as their childhood. She alters events, stands up to their father more, asserts that she and her brothers deserve better, and for a while, she thinks she's succeeded. Their dad mellows out, all three of them get a proper childhood for what remaining years of it they have left. They still get Chase most of the time, but it's better than before. Elliott still becomes Shroud, but that's okay because he doesn't kill their dad. Robbie lets Robert take over the suit at 21 instead of him taking over at 18. Things seem to be going smoothly. 

Then it happens again. 

Robert is blown out of the sky. 

This time, he dies. 

It's all over the news. 

Julia can't breathe, and Jamie is panicking at the news on TV which was being broadcast live. Their father doesn't say anything at first, his face is blank. Then after a while, he says the most vile thing Julia has ever heard him say in her entire life. 

""Well, that's probably about the only good thing he'll ever do for the legacy. He was never gonna be able to live up to it anyway. How disappointing.""

Julia turns her head towards him slowly, unable to process his words at first. It's Jamie who starts yelling at their dad for a change, asking him ""How could you say that? Your eldest son just died, and all you can think about is the stupid Mecha Man legacy?!"" and more. 

There's a ringing in Julia's ears that drowns out her emotions, Jamie's yelling, the noise of the TV, and every other sound around her. Only ringing. She slowly stands up from her place on the couch and stands in front of their father, who's still seated on his arm chair. He looks up at her in confusion, then she lands a punch on his cheek, then another, and another. She doesn't stop. 

Robbie tries to block at first, but she hits him straight in the gut. He doesn't expect his own daughter to attack him. She lifts the coffee table up and practically smashes it against him, and she continues to beat him up some more after that. (He essentially ends up looking like Shroud after Robert messed him up)

She tells him, ""I don't care how many people you saved and helped as Mecha Man, because you're gonna rot in hell for how shitty of a father you are."" Then, lands a killing blow. 

Jamie is stunned, looking at her like she was somebody else and not his sister. He whispers, ""Julia...what have you done?""

It's then she realizes that she's killed their dad, and her hands start shaking. She also realizes one more thing. 

She can't save her twin's life at the cost of her big brother's. She just can't live with that. She also can't live with the knowledge of having killed their father, and knowing that he died looking down on Robert like that. She ultimately decides...to go back in time, allow original events to happen, and just accept that there was no saving Jamie. 

And so, she just grieves. 

Note/s: 

• Robert eventually wakes up, and at that point, Julia's still on the quest to save Jamie and it's Chase who has to break the news to him about Jamie being dead. He is not okay throughout the timeline of the game. 

• Much like Max in Life is Strange, there's a limit to how much Julia can use her powers in a day, so she rests and recharges to use them the next day. Her energy to time-travel is also reliant on how well she's taking care of herself, which she isn't because of grief.

• She starts to time-travel around the time Robert wakes up, and I guess this Dream Verse AU decided to stretch out the timeline of the game a little more to accommodate this. 

• The dream actually officially ends with Chase putting out a recommendation for Julia to Blonde Blazer, not as a dispatcher, but for their HR department (if only to keep both her and Robert close). She doesn't get called to SDN until Robert's 2nd week there (which is set before the events at the bar).

• The dream mostly ended on an open note, so I've yet to decide how to make this into a full fanfic. That's all! 

If you read the whole thing, then thanks for sticking around to read this whole mess. This was truly a vivid dream for me and I was distressed at first by how graphic it was, but now I'm deciding how I can write a full fic about this. Hopefully, I manage to post it within the year, because this has been haunting me for two weeks now sksksk

Another small disclaimer/note: This is the third time I've had a dream this vivid which reflected my hyperfixations. The first one was in 2017, when I had a vivid dream about the DC universe, specifically the Batfam. The second time was in 2020, and it was about Stardew Valley.

1qhhvf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qhhvf2/why_everyone_around_you_is_falling_apart_the/,Why Everyone Around You Is Falling Apart The PSYCHOLOGY Behind Self Destruction Science Backed,"i've been noticing this pattern everywhere lately. smart people, disciplined people, people who seem to have their shit together on the surface, but they're slowly unraveling. i'm talking about friends, coworkers, even family members who are sleepwalking into self destruction without even realizing it.

spent the last year diving deep into behavioral psychology research, listening to podcasts from neuroscientists like [Andrew Huberman](https://www.hubermanlab.com/), reading books on habit formation, and talking to therapists. here's what nobody tells you: the habits that are quietly destroying your life don't look dangerous. they look normal. they look like what everyone else is doing.

the problem isn't that you're lazy or weak. it's that we're swimming in a society that's literally engineered to exploit our psychological vulnerabilities. social media algorithms designed by the smartest engineers at Stanford to hijack your dopamine system. work cultures that glorify burnout. food companies that hire neuroscientists to make products addictive.

but here's the thing. once you understand the mechanics behind these traps, you can actually do something about it.

# the habits that are quietly destroying you

**constant digital grazing**

your brain wasn't built for the amount of context switching you're doing. every time you check your phone between tasks, you're not just losing 10 seconds. research from Dr. Gloria Mark at UC Irvine shows it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully return to a task after an interruption.

you're basically running your brain on dial up internet while everyone else is using fiber optic. the cumulative effect is that you're operating at maybe 40% capacity without even knowing it.

what actually works: set specific times to check notifications. i know it sounds impossible but start with batching email checks to three times per day. your brain will fight you on this because it's literally addicted to the variable reward schedule of notifications, same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive.

**using substances to regulate your nervous system**

i'm not talking about being an alcoholic or drug addict. i'm talking about needing coffee to wake up, needing alcohol to relax, needing weed to sleep, needing sugar to feel good. you're outsourcing your nervous system regulation to external chemicals.

Dr. Anna Lembke's book ""[Dopamine Nation](https://www.amazon.in/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/152474672X)"" explains this perfectly. she's Stanford's addiction medicine chief and the book breaks down how we're all basically running from pain and chasing pleasure in ways that make both worse. every time you use a substance to change your state, you're training your brain that it can't handle that state naturally.

the dopamine deficit you create requires bigger hits next time. it's not dramatic, it's gradual, but five years from now you literally won't be able to function without these crutches.

try this instead: learn actual nervous system regulation techniques. the Insight Timer app has free guided breathwork sessions that genuinely work. box breathing for two minutes does what coffee promises but never delivers, actual sustained energy without the crash.

**chronic people pleasing**

this one's subtle as hell. you're not helping people because you want to. you're helping because you're terrified of disappointing them. you're morphing yourself into whatever version gets approval.

here's what the research shows: people pleasers have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and autoimmune disorders. your body keeps the score when you're constantly betraying yourself. Dr. Gabor Maté talks about this extensively in his work on trauma and disease.

the fucked up part is that people pleasing doesn't even make people like you more. it makes them respect you less. they can sense the inauthenticity, even if they can't name it.

boundary work is uncomfortable but necessary: start saying no to one small thing per week. not rudely, just honestly. ""i don't have capacity for that right now"" is a complete sentence. watch how nothing terrible happens.

**comparison scrolling**

you're measuring your behind the scenes against everyone else's highlight reel. but it goes deeper than that. social comparison isn't just making you feel bad, it's literally preventing you from figuring out what you actually want.

when you're constantly looking sideways at what everyone else is doing, you never look inward. you end up chasing goals that aren't even yours. you're running someone else's race.

Cal Newport's book ""[Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.in/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515)"" breaks down why this is so destructive. he's a computer science professor at Georgetown and argues convincingly that we're not using technology intentionally, we're letting it use us. the book gives you a framework for taking back control.

practical fix: delete social media apps from your phone for 30 days. keep the accounts, just remove the apps. use the browser version if you absolutely need to post something. the friction of logging in manually will reveal how much of your usage is just mindless habit.

**ignoring your body's signals**

you're tired but you drink caffeine. you're full but you keep eating. you need to pee but you finish the email first. you're in pain but you push through.

every time you override your body's signals, you're training yourself to disconnect from internal wisdom. over years, this creates a profound alienation from yourself. you literally stop knowing what you need.

Bessel van der Kolk's ""The Body Keeps the Score"" is THE book on this. he's a trauma researcher who shows how disconnection from your body is at the root of most psychological suffering. insanely good read that will make you question everything you think you know about mental health.

For anyone wanting to actually internalize this stuff instead of just reading and forgetting, there's an AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from research papers, expert talks, and books like the ones mentioned here. Built by former Google AI engineers, it generates personalized audio content based on whatever you're struggling with, whether that's boundary setting, nervous system regulation, or breaking digital addiction patterns.

You can customize the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and research backing. The adaptive learning plan evolves as you interact with it, so it's not just random content, it's structured around your specific goals. What makes it less annoying than other learning apps is you can pause mid-session to ask questions or explore tangents, kind of like having an actual conversation about the material.

start small: set a timer to check in with your body every two hours. pause and scan from head to toe. what sensations are present? what's your body asking for? sounds woo woo but this is backed by decades of somatic psychology research.

**living in preparation mode**

you're always getting ready to start living. once you lose the weight. once you get the promotion. once you find the relationship. once you have more money.

meanwhile years are passing and you're not actually present for your life. you're in this perpetual state of not good enough yet.

this is what psychologists call arrival fallacy. the belief that reaching some external milestone will fundamentally change how you feel. but research on lottery winners and people who achieve major goals shows happiness returns to baseline within months.

the shift: start treating today as if it matters. not in some carpe diem cliche way, but in the sense that this is actually your life happening right now. the promotion might not come. the weight might not come off. then what? you'll have wasted years waiting for permission to enjoy being alive.

these aren't dramatic interventions. you're not going to overhaul your entire life overnight. but if you pick one or two of these and actually implement them, six months from now you'll barely recognize yourself.

the people who aren't falling apart aren't smarter or more disciplined. they've just figured out which battles actually matter and stopped fighting the wrong ones.",1,1768859312.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

When I got to grad school and even beyond, she began college. She started to talk about college or her accomplishments/ this all or nothing thinking with saying she’s a failure re if she doesn’t get an internship or something. And our relationship with our parents is completely different. My sister has trouble with failing, because she views it as a life sentence. Ex: she needs the highest grade on a test, or a job rejection is a life rejection. 

Sometimes I ask her to make a choice if we go do something. And she doesn’t want to. She tells me to chose, despite me telling her we should mutually decide. Because I’ll suggest something and she says no. Then no again. Etc. So she tells me ok chose from these 3 choices then (wether it be food, coffee, a day to hang out) and we have different aspirations and ambitions. I recall she was mad at me for being in my grad program for 3 years because she googled it and said my program is 2 years. Sometimes I feel this tension between us where she says something that’s meant to be a slight at me. 

Also if I tell her something personal like friend or relationship stuff she often dismisses me. But when she asks me for advice, she won’t actually take the advice, and later complains that she should have.

There was 4 of us (including me) but one friend only joined for the first half of the journey. Would it be fair to ask the first friend for £5, and the other two for £10 each? I checked beforehand that they were okay if I asked for £5 for fuel cause it was a long journey, but I wasn't expecting to use so much fuel or for it to be so expensive.

I've never asked anyone to send me money before for driving them places. The two I'm thinking of asking £10 for I've been driving for nearly a year entirely free of charge and quite regularly (probably averaging once every week I'll drive them somewhere.) I never normally ask for money cause either it's my idea to go somewhere or it would only be a short drive - but over the year I've spent a solid £100 between the two of them on fuel for drives we've done.

They're both skint but I'm fine for money which is another reason I've never asked. I was only invited today though cause they needed a second car, and it was a last minute thing and not something I would have chosen to do myself. So, would it be unfair to follow up with the request to chip in for the fuel or should I not bother? I don't need the money, it just feels a bit like I'm being used otherwise - but idk if that's normal.

When I arrived at the end, I was in the kitchen of someone I knew well watching them like a silhouette as they stood in front of what I knew was their coffee machine and they appeared to be making a coffee. Next thing I awoke and that person had actually just sent me a message including a photo of the specific coffee brand they were making. This absolutely blew my mind.

1qhhnmd,https://beanshelf.com/,New Free Coffee Discovery & Tracking WebApp - Early Access,"I like to try lots of coffee from lots of places, but I struggle to keep track of it all.  When I do find a coffee I really like it’s not always easy to find other similar ones. I tried so many apps and none of them were ever going to work for me so I built BeanShelf and I am soft launching it today.

BeanShelf is Coffee Database & Discovery tool first, everything else second. The focus is on helping you keep track & understand the coffee you are enjoying without having to manually enter all the details to keep track of them.

  
**How to try it**

[https://beanshelf.com/](https://beanshelf.com/)  most things work without an account, only need to sign up when you want to start tracking things. Images attached to the post should give you a rough idea of the main screens.

Few Roasters examples

* [https://beanshelf.com/roaster/proud-mary-coffee](https://beanshelf.com/roaster/proud-mary-coffee)



More features will come but I wanted to get feedback to prioritise

* Directory of 15,000 of coffees across 500+’s of roasters (Mostly Australian!)
* Anyone can add another roaster, click the green “Add Roaster” button at the top of any page. It supports most web stores and will auto import the data in real time (origin country, roast type, processing method, sensory notes etc)
* Provide listing of both current and previous coffees from different vendors (where we have data, this will grow over time)
* Keep track of what you have (Ordered, Unopened, Opened, Finished)

It’s early access so it’s a bit buggy, if you are reading this you are one of the first people to see this!

What Works

* Add Coffee Roasters automatically (Works best with Shopify and WooCommerce based online stores), see the import in real time most will take only a few minutes unless they have huge back catalogues.
* Basic coffee tracking by adding to your “Shelf” to keep key details, Order date, Roast Date, Open date etc.
* Desktop or tablet sized screen

What kind of works

* Not all online stores are supported yet and our backend uses some logic to ensure we are only adding coffee roasters, if we are not really sure it will get flagged for manual review.
* Categorisation of products isn’t always perfect, we filter out Bundles, subscriptions, equipment, merch etc. This isn’t perfect so you might see some things in the wrong places and some things might be missing
* Mobile view is a work in progress, some pages work great, not so well on others
* What about feature X or Y?

Please tell me what is priority to you, I have been building this for me and what I want. There are lots of other features that I in various states of completion that will launch in time.

Tell me what think? Tell me what features you think I should prioritise next?",2,1768858842.0,AustralianCoffee,0,1.0,False

1qhhlz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1qhhlz9/15k_minimalist_45_guest_shotgun_wedding_debrief/,($15k) Minimalist 45 guest shotgun wedding debrief,"What do you do when you and your boyfriend move to a new area and then you find out that you’re pregnant? You plan a shotgun wedding in less than 4 months, of course! Now that we are on the other side of our wedding day, I wanted to prepare a cost breakdown in case helpful to any future brides and grooms. I have stripped out a few identifying details but am happy to privately share the specifics if requested. We had an “off-season” wedding in mid-January, and covered all expenses ourselves.

**Costs (in a HCOL major metropolitan area) - $15,670 TOTAL for 45 guests**:

* **Venue & Food/Drink ($10,500)**: In lieu of reserving a venue and then separately arranging catering, we opted to reserve a large room at a local restaurant with service, food and drink included. The reservation was for 4 hours on a Saturday, and we were originally quoted a $1,000 room reservation fee, $5,000 food and beverage minimum, plus local tax, 3% event fee, and 20% gratuity, which would have put us at around $7,800. However, we chose a more expensive food + beverage package, which bumped up our total. Food was self-serve/buffet and consisted of a first course of various small bites, a second course buffet of 3 entree options, and no dessert option. Beverages consisted of an open bar with selections of wine, beer, and basic mixed drinks (i.e., no special cocktails), as well as coffee/tea service. This food and drink package ended up being $170 per head for 45 guests, and with the additional charges, the total came to $10,500. 
* **Cake ($160)**: Since our food and beverage package at the venue did not include dessert, we got a 16”x12” sheet cake ($160) from a local bakery, which they said would serve 48 people. The cake was not customized in any way. The venue cut and served the cake at no extra charge, and there was more than enough for our 45 guests.
* **Florals & Decor ($25)**: One reason we chose our venue was because the room we were planning to use was already nicely furnished (with big windows, white curtains, plants, tablecloths, and small cute table arrangements), so we didn’t do anything extra with decor, and the room looked great the day of. Since we were also not doing a procession/traditional ceremony, I didn’t want a bouquet. However, my mom and I made enough boutonnieres for the bride, groom, respective parents and grandparents with 2 bunches of flowers we bought from Trader Joe’s ($20), floral tape and pins ($5), and some ribbon and tulle we already had.
* **Photographer ($1,700)**: We hired a local husband + wife photographer team for 2 hours of coverage. They gave us a few additional discounts because we were local, we had fewer than 50 guests, and our January wedding date was in the off-season. I believe that without the discounts, it would have been around $2,000.
* **Groom's Outfit ($1,800)**: Bought a new suit and shirt ($1,500), tie ($100), and dress shoes ($200). Technically a wedding cost because getting married is a good excuse to get a new suit, but everything will be re-worn for future dressy occasions. 
* **Bride's Outfit ($220)**: I did not opt for a fancy wedding gown and instead purchased a white cocktail dress ($140) and white flats ($40) from Nordstrom during Black Friday sales. I ordered multiple dresses at once to try them on and returned the rejects. My veil I got for $40 on Etsy.
* **Wedding Rings ($1,180)**: Ordered two 14k gold wedding bands from Costco. Cost includes tax.
* **Marriage License + Certificates ($85)**: Our county allows us to do a walk-in same-day marriage at the superior court, which took us about an hour from filling out the initial application to leaving with our marriage certificate. Getting the marriage license and several copies of our certified marriage certificate cost $85 cash (using a credit card would have incurred an additional 4.5% charge).
* **Things that were “free”**:
   * **Hair & Makeup**: I looked up how to do updos and practiced on myself for about a week before the wedding. The actual materials used for my updo were just elastics, bobby pins, a blowdryer, and lots of hairspray, which I already had. My makeup was basically just my daily makeup with extra eyeshadow and blush and consisted of concealer, contour, eyeshadow, blush, mascara, and lipstick that I already had. I also drank lots of water and paid extra attention to my skincare in the weeks before, so I’d have a nice base to work with.
   * **Website**: Used Joy for our wedding website and RSVPs (we did not make a registry). Took a few hours to put everything together.
   * **Invites**: Used Figma Buzz to make our digital invitations and sent them out via email.
   * **Namecards**: Used Figma Buzz again to make namecards and then printed, cut, and glued them to card stock in the days before the wedding.
   * **Music**: The venue had speakers we could connect to via Bluetooth, so we just made a 4-hour long Spotify playlist.
   * **Card/Gift Box**: Dressed up a wicker basket we had with some tulle so guests had somewhere to drop off cards.
   * **The generosity of others**: In addition to my mom’s help making the boutonnieres, one relative put together little candy goodie bags for each guest (\~$200), another relative brought a fruit tray to supplement dessert (\~$50), and another relative took me to get my nails done (\~$60). The absence of these kind gestures would not have been showstoppers, but these contributions really helped to make the day feel special. Many others also very kindly offered to chip in and help out in other ways, which we turned down because we wanted to be self-sufficient 🙂 

**Things that we did** ***not*** **do and relevant considerations**:

* **No wedding planner or coordinator**: From deciding our wedding date to the day of, planning everything took about 3.5 months. What took the longest was shopping around venues and the photographer. We preferred to book a restaurant, since that would cover venue, service, and food/drink all in one, but many restaurants, especially those in the downtown area, wanted a full buyout for 50 guests, which would have cost \~20-30k. It helped that January is an “off-season” so some venues and photographers were willing to offer discounts. Many emails and phone calls were exchanged with various restaurants and photographers, and our greatest allies in our search were Google and Instagram. Our actual wedding day was relatively unstructured, and everyone was in the same room for the whole time, so a day-of coordinator felt unnecessary.
* **No officiant or ceremony**: From the get-go, we were not keen on doing a traditional ceremony with vows because it just wasn’t our thing. In lieu of vows, we each did a short speech in the middle of the event to thank our guests and declare our love for each other. Then a few other people each did a short toast.
* **No wedding party or bachelor/bachelorette**: We both had large families, so we opted to only invite family and no friends, which made having a wedding party kind of moot. Our wedding was so minimal anyway that any bridesmaids/groomsmen wouldn’t have had much to do.
* **No rehearsal dinner**: Without a ceremony, we didn’t really have anything to rehearse. We did make time to spend time with some of our out-of-town guests the day before and after the wedding.
* **No DJ or dancefloor**: We were aiming for a pretty laid back event, and the venue probably would not have been conducive to a dancefloor. Our Spotify playlist was very sufficient to provide background music. 
* **No hotel reservations**: The venue itself was very close to where we lived. We were also fortunate that (a) many of our guests were local and (b) our out-of-town guests arranged accommodations for themselves. 
* **No registry**: Since we’ve lived together for several years and have a lot of stuff already and have a few more years of apartment living ahead of us, we opted out of a gift registry. However, basically all of our guests very generously contributed cash gifts, and we will ended up recouping a significant portion of our wedding expenses.

**Takeaways**:

* 4 hours felt like just enough time to do everything we wanted to do, which wasn’t very much at all. However, even with 4 hours and fewer than 50 guests, I didn’t feel like I had enough time to properly greet everyone and catch up.
* Planning a wedding this minimal took a lot more time and energy than I initially expected, even though there weren’t any huge obstacles, and everyone involved in planning was super accommodating and cooperative.

When did content creation become a full time job in allegedly dangling queerness like a discount accessory from Canal Street?

In a city where labels matter Prada Versace Gay Straight some creators have discovered a new one Ambiguously Marketable. They flirt with the community for clicks pose with just enough homoerotic tension to keep the gays watching and then sprint back to no homo the second a brand deal requires a family friendly image. Allegedly.

But as I sipped my iced coffee and scrolled past yet another shirtless bro winking at the camera like he invented the concept of queer longing I had to ask myself

Is this harmless thirst trapping or emotional tax fraud?

Because while they are busy playing gay for engagement real queer people are out here fighting for visibility safety and the right to exist without a disclaimer. We do not get to turn our identity on and off like a ring light. We do not get to monetize the aesthetic without living the consequences. And we certainly do not get to claim allyship while allegedly using our community as a marketing strategy.

So I could not help but wonder

When straight men allegedly queer bait for clout are they courting the gay community or exploiting it?

And more importantly how many of us have paid the emotional price for someone else’s algorithmic gain?

Until next time stay fabulous stay discerning and remember

If it walks like a thirst trap, talks like a thirst, it might just allegedly be a bait!

I’m a straight 35-year-old male who is open-minded, respectful, kind, and compassionate. I’m reaching out in hopes of connecting with people who have significantly improved or overcome an anxiety disorder without medication or formal therapy. I’ve dealt with severe anxiety for most of my life and I’m actively seeking a healthier, more balanced way forward. I have thoughtful, personal reasons for choosing not to go the medication or therapy route. If those approaches have worked for you, that’s great—I have nothing against them; they’re just not the path I’m taking.

I’m looking to learn from real-life experiences, coping strategies, mindset shifts, lifestyle changes, or personal insights that helped you move forward. I truly believe that spending time with people I can relate to—and who’ve walked a similar path—could be beneficial and encouraging.

If meeting in person feels comfortable, I’m willing to meet in a public setting such as a coffee shop, library, or similar safe environment. Online conversations are also welcome.

If this resonates with you and you’re open to sharing your journey, feel free to reach out. Thank you for reading.",8,1768858649.0,askTO,4,0.9,False
1qhhk2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/comments/1qhhk2x/do_you_really_believe_in_imaginary_friends/,Do You Really Believe in Imaginary Friends?,"I know I didn’t. Personally I never had one as a kid and if I’m being honest I never knew anyone that did. My son Christian is 7 and since he was a toddler he has always had a big imagination. From your typical Nerf battles to booking an entire pay-per view for his wrestling action figures, Chris always found a way to keep himself entertained. He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let’s just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid.

Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn’t used to or maybe it was the whole “not fitting in” thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 

The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 

“Daddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD…I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!” 

I laughed and said “Alright buddy slow it down it’s only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.”

“Dad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!”

“Well DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!”

“OH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!”

Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall “Get started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!” 

I haven’t been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son’s face, I couldn’t help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn’t wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out “Babe?!” In a worried voice. 

I made my way towards Chris’ room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said “Honey, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!” 

Chris chuckled and said “It’s still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!” Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.

That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we’ve been happy since we had to move.

We shared a kiss and went to bed.

For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the “bestest” friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren’t allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie’s parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.

As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole “jobless” thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn’t buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. “Richie let me borrow it!” While I didn’t think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn’t a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.

When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.

“Okay this is gonna sound bad. Do you think Chris is taking these toys from the school or maybe even a student? Is Richie even real?” As the words left my mouth I realize it sounded much worse than what I had imagined. Chris was a bit of a different kid, sure. But he wasn’t a liar. At least I didn’t think so. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Take a look from my perspective though. We are hearing all these amazing things about “Richie”. Chris has never once mentioned him coming over, sleeping over, or even going over to Richie’s house. He didn’t talk about any other friends or students. He came home with a different toy almost weekly and always had the same excuse as to how he got it.

Alyssa looked at me with worried eyes. “God, I hope not. Things were finally starting to look up.”

“Well I am going to ask him about it and see what he says.”

As I made my way down the stairs to Chris’ room I thought I heard something. It sounded like muffled talking coming from his room but I couldn’t quite make out what was being said. I stopped in my tracks and thought for a second. What if Chris was struggling so much to fit in he made Richie up. What if Richie is what Chris wants a friend to be. What If Richie is Chris’ imaginary friend. My heart sank. I hoped that wasn’t the case but that would certainly explain some things. The lack of other friends, the fact that Chris never asked if Richie could come over, and now the talking. What if Chris was talking to his imaginary friend. What do I say, what do I do? Will this just be a phase? I didn’t have the answers. Standing around in the hallway wasn’t going to get me any either. I knocked on Chris’ door and walked inside.

“Hey dude, how’s school going?”

“It’s soooo good dad”

“Oh yeah why’s that? Let me guess, Richie?” I said with a forced smile

“Yeah! He is the best! He is always giving me stuff, like these toys!”

“I wanted to ask you about that Chris, are you um, are you sure Richie is giving you these toys?”

“Whatcha mean daddy?”

“Are you taking them from the school maybe? Another kid? You know, just borrowing them of course.”

Chris sat there for a second and seemed to be thinking. “No dad, Richie is giving me these toys. I told you that! What did ya forget or something?” He started giggling.

I smiled at him and thought about how happy he was. I gave him a big hug and left his room. I spent the whole night just thinking to myself, what am I gonna do about this? 

It had been a few days since my little talk with Chris. He hasn’t mentioned Richie any more than usual and he hasn’t come home with any new toys. I had finally had luck with job searching. Funny enough as I was scrolling through endless pages I came across a job listing at Chris’ school. It was for a janitor. I know it doesn’t sound like the most glorious job but I knew any amount of extra income would help. I applied and quickly received an email from the school to set up an interview for the next day. I knew Alyssa would be happy and I figured Chris would be too. Even though I would be working, at least it was at his school where I could see him throughout the day. If I’m being honest a little piece of me was eager to see if “Richie” was in fact a real kid and not some made up imaginary friend. 

I waited on the front porch to meet Chris as he got off the bus. We lived close to the school but just far enough away that he still required a bus. As Chris got off the bus I can see he had his head down. I met him in the street and asked what was wrong. When he looked at me I could tell he had been crying. He hadn’t cried in weeks, it had me worried.

“Chris what happened?! Are you okay?”

“No.”

“Tell me what’s wrong kiddo.”

“It’s Richie dad, he is leaving. He said he was moving and today was his last day.” He said as tears started to stream down his face.

“Oh man, I’m so sorry buddy. Come here.” I hugged him tight. I took his backpack off his shoulders and we continued towards the house. Chris didn’t leave his room for the rest of the night. He didn’t eat dinner. He just cried. When Alyssa came home I broke the news to her. She was upset but had hopes that Chris would be able to make some new friends. 

Alyssa was in the shower when I decided I would go check on Chris and say goodnight. I made my way down the stairs towards his room. I stopped moving when I heard Chris talking. I couldn’t quite make out what he was saying through the door but as I got closer to his room the words became more clear.

“C’mon Richie do you really have to go. We had so much fun. You are my best friend and I really wish you could just stay with me.”

Before I knocked on the door an odd feeling came over me. This all but proved that Richie wasn’t real. Who could he be talking to. He didn’t have a cell phone. Richie wasn’t in the house. I proceeded to knock on his door and enter the room. There was Chris, sitting on his bed, walkie-talkie in hand. Not knowing what else to say I asked him.

“Who are you talking to?”

“Richie, daddy, I was telling him I don’t want him to leave.”

“Richie gave that to you? Richie is real?”

“Richie is my friend dad, of course he is real.”

I took the walkie-talkie from his hand and pressed down the button.

“Hello!.. Who’s there?! … Is this Richie?! …Answer me!”

There was no answer. No noise from whoever had the other walkie talkie. Silence. I proceeded to ask Chris about Richie.

“Richie gave you this? Why? Does he live close by?”

“I dunno, he gave it to me a while ago. We talk on it all the time.”

That must’ve what I heard the other night. Chris was talking to Richie or whoever it was that had the other walkie-talkie. Richie must live close by. He has to be close to have a strong enough signal to talk to Chris. I took the walkie-talkie away from him. I kissed him on the head. Told him I loved him and that I would be taking him to school tomorrow. I didn’t even get to tell him that I was going to hopefully be working at his school. 

The next morning I made some eggs for me and Chris. I asked how he was feeling and he just shrugged. I assumed he was upset about Richie moving and he was angry that I took the walkie-talkie away. Regardless it was time to head to school. Once we parked I grabbed Chris from the backseat. He looked at me strangely.

“Dad whatcha doing? You’re supposed to drop me off.”

“I know bud but today is different! I may get a job at your school, I’m here to talk to your principal! I may become your new janitor! Now I know-“ I was cut off by Chris’ cries. He ran into the school with tears streaming down his face. Did he really not want me to work at the school? Was it embarrassing to have your dad here or was it embarrassing that I may be a janitor? Either way I hurried to the principal’s office, I didn’t want to be late for the interview. I walked into the office right on time and spoke to the secretary. 

“Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Golding. I have an interview today.”

“Ah yes, you must be here for the janitor position that opened up. I’m really gonna miss the old one.” She chuckled. “I really never met a sweeter man. Anyway right this way Mr. Golding is waiting for you inside.”

I walked into the office with my head held high. I needed this job so I was there to impress. Mr. Golding was seated behind the desk but stood up as I walked into. He reached out a hand and I graciously excepted.

“Hello Mr. Golding, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview for this position.”

“Of course Mr. Williams thank you for coming for the interview so quickly. We need to fill the position ASAP. As you can guess a school can get quite messy.” 

“I could only imagine. My son, Chris is a 2nd grader here and he is always making some sort of mess.” 

“If I’m being honest Mr. Williams after looking over your resume you are definitely more than qualified to work here. You seem like a man with a good head on his shoulders, you were punctual, and if I’m being honest because Richard left us so suddenly we are a bit desperate to fill his position. So if you would like it the job is yours!”

A giant smile spread across my face. The tension instantly released from my shoulders. I finally got another job. I was beyond happy. I quickly accepted the job without hesitiation.

“Thank you so much Mr. Golding! I promise you won’t regret this. You don’t understand how badly I needed this job!”

“Mr. Williams welcome aboard! I have the master keys here in this drawer let me just grab them.” Mr. Golding reached into his bottom drawer and pulled out a large set of keys. “Every key is labeled, the Janitor’s equipment is in a supply container in the back of the school. Thank you for taking the job on short notice!”

I couldn’t believe how fast of a process that was. I figured there was going to be at least 1 more interview. The fact that I could start right away was all the more reason to be excited. I looked at the keys in my hand while walking down the hallway and decided I wanted to check out how the previous Janitor kept the equipment. As I approached the supply container I froze in place. In my excitement of getting the job I completely brushed past the fact the Janitor’s name was Richard. This couldn’t be THE Richie that Chris was talking about, could it? No, that didn’t make any sense. It had to be a coincidence. Richard is a common name. Plus this was a school. No way none of the teachers or students didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. As I inserted the key into the lock my hands were shaking. I didn’t do a very good job of convincing myself that a grown man did not befriend my son. I twisted the key and removed the lock. 

What I found inside activated a concoction of feelings in me I had never felt at the same time. Rage, anguish, hate, nervousness, sadness all in one. The walls were lined with Children’s movie posters. Action figures spread about the small coffee table inside. Nerf guns laid on a dusty old couch. That’s when I saw it. A fucking walkie-talkie. The same walkie-talkie that Chris had the night before. Whoever this sick bastard was, was talking to my fucking 7 year old son. Tears started coming down my face like someone had turned on a faucet. I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen in time. I started ripping the place apart. I don’t know if it was out of anger or if I was looking for something specific. I did not care I was just moving. Toys, snacks, candy. What the fuck. The last drawer I opened I truly wish I hadn’t. I was staring down at pictures. Pictures of my son. My son and this sick fuck “Richie”. Taking selfies together like it was some sort of fucked up prom picture. I had to leave. I ran to Chris’ class picked him up and headed straight toward the exit. While holding my crying son, I began to breakdown. Chris whispered in my ear.

“You’ll never be as cool as Richie.” ",1,1768858630.0,TheMidnightArchives,0,1.0,False

I’m a straight 35-year-old male who is open-minded, respectful, kind, and compassionate. I’m reaching out in hopes of connecting with people who have significantly improved or overcome an anxiety disorder without medication or formal therapy. I’ve dealt with severe anxiety for most of my life and I’m actively seeking a healthier, more balanced way forward. I have thoughtful, personal reasons for choosing not to go the medication or therapy route. If those approaches have worked for you, that’s great—I have nothing against them; they’re just not the path I’m taking.

I’m looking to learn from real-life experiences, coping strategies, mindset shifts, lifestyle changes, or personal insights that helped you move forward. I truly believe that spending time with people I can relate to—and who’ve walked a similar path—could be beneficial and encouraging.

If meeting in person feels comfortable, I’m willing to meet in a public setting such as a coffee shop, library, or similar safe environment. Online conversations are also welcome.

If this resonates with you and you’re open to sharing your journey, feel free to reach out. Thank you for reading.",4,1768858495.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,1.0,False

1qhhgqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qhhgqh/im_stuck_in_the_louisiana_bayou_i_dont_think_im/,"I'm stuck in the Louisiana bayou, I don't think I'm leaving","I hadn’t been back to my grandmother’s house since I was a teenager. I didn’t realize how long it had been until my mom mentioned it over the phone. Back then, she still made me go with her, long drives and long nights in a house that always felt like it was swallowed by the swamp. Somewhere along the way, the visits just stopped. Life got in the way. My mom called me on a Tuesday evening.


“She’s still living out there by herself,” she said. “And she isn’t doing like she used to.”


Grandma had been widowed for ten years. Grandpa passed quietly in his sleep, and she never left that house after. Neighbors came by to check on her, bring groceries, help with chores. But she wouldn’t move. “The land won’t let me,” she told my mom once, and I never really understood what she meant.


“She’s been asking about you,” my mom said. “You should go see her.” So I did.

The drive from New Orleans took longer than I remembered. Streetlights got fewer and fewer until they disappeared. The paved roads turned into dirt roads that got narrower the farther I went. The swamp felt like it was pressing close on both sides. Spanish moss hung from the trees, heavy and still. Water puddled in the low spots. The smell of mud and wet plants stuck to the air and my clothes.


I had to park my car about half a mile from her house. The road past that point had turned into mud so soft it would have swallowed my car. I grabbed my bag and started walking. My shoes sank a little with each step, and the wet smell of the swamp stayed in my nose.


Her house was at the edge of the water, lifted on cinder blocks so it looked like it was floating above the swamp. A narrow wooden dock stretched out from the porch into the dark water. I could hear it creak under the wind. The house itself looked smaller than I remembered, like it had been settling into the swamp for decades. She opened the door herself.


She was thinner than I remembered and bent in ways that made me worry, but her eyes were still sharp. She leaned on the doorframe and reached for me. She stood long enough to hug me, her hands gripping my shirt like she needed to make sure I was real.


“Lord, child, you done let the years slip by.” she said, her tone in that classic grandma nag. “I didn’t forget,” I told her. She laughed softly. “Mm. That’s what they all say.”

Inside, the house smelled like old wood and dried herbs, with something sharp underneath it all. The curtains were drawn even though it was still daylight. I noticed little things without really thinking about them. White lines near the doorframe, a small cloth bundle pinned high on the wall where only the eyes could reach it.


I didn’t ask about them. Something told me not to.


That night, after the neighbors had gone and the swamp swallowed the sun, the night sounds came alive. Frogs called across the water. Insects buzzed thick in the air. Somewhere deep in the distance, an alligator bellowed, long and low, the sound rolling through the ground like it was alive under my feet.

Grandma sat in her chair, listening. “They stirred up tonight,” she said. “It’s just noise,” I said. “Same as always.” She looked at me for a long moment. “Baby,” she said, “you ain’t been here long enough to know what always sound like.” I laughed lightly. I thought she was just teasing me like she used to.


I’m not laughing about it now.
 

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The heat from the day hadn’t left, and the air was thick with cicadas screaming so loud it felt like it was shaking the walls. Somewhere in the swamp, water splashed against something, maybe a branch, maybe a fish. I kept turning over in bed, listening, but the sounds only made it worse.


I got up to grab a glass of water, hoping it would settle me. The hallway was dark, the floorboards creaking under my weight. I stepped out onto the porch, the night thick around me. The deck smelled like wet wood and moss, the swamp smelling sharper than it had during the day. I leaned against the railing and tried to breathe. That’s when I saw it. A little glint of light, far out in the water, reflecting the moon. I squinted. It was down there at the bottom, just barely visible through the dark water. I leaned closer, curiosity winning over caution. It looked like some kind of pendant, maybe old and made of brass or silver, tangled in weeds.


I reached for it, and then I froze. A low bellow rolled out from the water, deep and menacing. My heart jumped. I whipped my head toward the sound. From the far edge of the swamp, something massive moved through the dark water. A bull gator, thick and huge, pushed itself into the shallow part near the deck. Its head broke the surface, glinting eyes catching the moonlight. The water rippled as it moved, slow and deliberate, like it knew I was there.


I tried to step back, planning to get away from the edge, but one of the deck planks groaned and gave out under me. I fell through.
Water hit me fast and cold, I was never a good swimmer. I kept thinking about that gator, just below me somewhere, waiting.
Somehow I was able to grab the deck and pull myself up. I looked down at the hole where the plank had broken. The bull gator slid past slowly, scales glinting under the moon, just where I had fallen. My hands shook and my was heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst.


I went back inside, dripping and shivering. Grandma was in the kitchen, calling out my name. “You all right, baby?” she said. Her voice was calm, but her eyes were sharp when she saw me. “I… yeah. I’m fine,” I said, dripping water onto the floor. She shook her head, a little smile on her lips. “Those planks were going to give out some day anyway. It’s all right. Go get yourself changed.” I did as she said, but I didn’t sleep much after that. 

Every sound from the swamp kept me awake, the cicadas, the water, something moving just beyond sight. I kept thinking about that pendant at the bottom and the bull gator, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had only just begun to notice how alive the swamp really was.


The next morning, Grandma sent me into town. She gave me a short list written in shaky handwriting. Milk, bread, her blood pressure medicine, and the kind of coffee she liked even though the doctor told her not to drink it anymore. The town was small, just a single grocery store, a gas station, and a few buildings that looked like they had been there longer than anyone alive.


The drive was quiet. Trees crowded the road on both sides, and the swamp followed me most of the way, water flashing between trunks. I felt better being away from the house, like I could finally breathe again. The city had taught me to trust noise. Silence always made me uneasy.


The grocery store was cool inside, the air smelling like old fruit and cleaner. There were only a few people shopping, all of them quiet, moving slow. I grabbed what was on Grandma’s list and headed to the counter.
That’s when I noticed the clerk’s necklace.
It was small, hanging on a thin chain, but I knew it right away. The shape was the same as the pendant I had seen in the swamp. Same curves, same strange markings carved into it. My stomach dropped.
“Hey,” I said, trying to sound casual. “That necklace. Where’d you get it?”


The clerk stopped moving. He didn’t look up at first. Then his eyes lifted and locked onto mine. They were flat. Empty. Like he was looking through me instead of at me.
For a second, I thought maybe he hadn’t heard me. I opened my mouth to repeat myself, but before I could, he rang up my items and said my total. His voice was normal. Calm. Like nothing had happened.
I paid and took my bags, my hands sweating. As I turned to leave, I felt it. That crawling feeling on the back of my neck. Like someone was watching me. I glanced back over my shoulder. The clerk was still staring at me.
I pushed the door open and stepped outside, the heat hitting me hard. Even then, I didn’t feel alone. I walked to my car with that same feeling following me.


That night is when things really started to feel wrong. The sun went down, bleeding through the trees before the swamp swallowed it whole. Grandma went to bed early. She always did. I could hear her radio murmuring through the thin walls, gospel low enough to feel more like a hum than music.
Outside, the cicadas had been loud all evening. Screaming like they were trying to tear the night open. I sat on the edge of the bed scrolling on my phone, trying to ignore how tight my chest felt.


Then, all at once, the noise stopped.
Not faded. Not slowed down. Just gone.
I froze. I grew up in Louisiana. I knew the swamp never went quiet unless something was very wrong. Even the city had its sounds at night. Sirens, cars, people. Silence like that felt heavy, like pressure on my ears. I got up and went to the kitchen for a glass of water. My hands were shaking, and I told myself it was just nerves. Long day. Not enough sleep. That’s what city life teaches you to say when things don’t make sense.


I stepped out onto the deck for air. The moon was high, shining down on the water. The swamp looked flat and still, like black glass. No frogs. No insects. Nothing moving.
That’s when I heard the whispering.
It wasn’t loud. It sounded like voices carried underwater. Soft and layered, like a crowd speaking all at once but too far away to understand. My skin prickled. I turned around.


They were standing at the edge of the yard, where the grass gave way to mud. At least five of them. Maybe more. They wore old clothes, the kind you see in history books. Long coats, dresses hanging loose and heavy with wet. Everything about them was dark and soaked, like they had climbed straight out of the swamp.


Their heads weren’t human. Each one wore the rotted head of a gator, skin peeling, teeth showing through torn flesh. Mud dripped from their jaws. Around their necks, every single one of them wore the same pendant I had seen in the water. The same one the clerk had worn. It caught the moonlight and gleamed. They didn’t move. They didn’t speak.
Then, all at once, they raised their arms and pointed at me. That’s the last thing I remember.


I woke up in my bed like nothing had happened. Morning light was coming through the thin curtains, pale and gray. For a second, I thought maybe I was back home in the city. Then I heard the swamp. Water shifting. A bird calling far off. The house creaking the way it always did.


My clothes were dry. My body felt sore, like I had slept wrong, but there was no mud, no water, no sign I had ever been outside.
Grandma was already up. I could hear her in the kitchen, moving slow, dishes clinking together. When I came out, she was standing at the sink, leaning heavy on the counter.
“You up now,” she said without turning around. “Good. These joints ain’t what they used to be.” I took her place and started washing. The water was cold. Everything was too normal. I kept replaying the night in my head, every detail sharp like it had just happened.


“I had a dream,” I said finally. She hummed, like she already knew. “A bad one,” I added. “Real bad. Felt… real.” She didn’t answer right away. I scrubbed a plate harder than I needed to. I told her about the silence. About the people. I didn’t say gator heads at first, but the words came out anyway. I told her how they pointed at me. How I woke up shaking.
She set a dish towel down slow and looked at me. Her eyes were cloudy with age, but sharp underneath.


“Dreams don’t always mean something.” she said. I laughed a little, tried to shake it off. “I know. Just saying it felt different. Like it wasn’t just in my head.” She was quiet for a long moment. Outside, something splashed in the water. “Spirits got a way of speaking when they want to,” she said softly. “They don’t always use words.”


I looked at her then. “You saying that wasn’t a dream?” She shook her head, just a little. “I’m saying some things don’t come for you until you step back where you belong to.” I waited for her to say more, but she didn’t. She picked up her coffee and rolled herself toward the table, leaving the rest hanging in the air.
I stood there with my hands in the sink, watching the water, wishing she’d just say it plain. But Grandma never did things that way. And somehow, that scared me more than if she had.


I didn’t sleep much that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt like something was standing just outside the house, waiting. Grandma’s radio was off, which made it worse. I laid there listening to the water lap against the dock and the house creak, telling myself I was being stupid.


Sometime after midnight I got up. I didn’t have a plan. I just knew Grandma knew more than she was saying. The way she talked that morning, the way she cut herself off. It sat in my chest like a stone. Her room was dark, the door cracked open. I could hear her breathing, slow and steady. I stayed quiet and went into the small sitting room instead. She kept most of her things there. Old drawers. Stacked boxes. Nothing locked.


I started with the dresser. Old letters, folded so many times the paper was soft. Church programs. Receipts. Normal stuff. Then I found the photo album. It was heavy, thick leather cover, worn smooth from hands. When I opened it, the first pages were what I expected. Black and white photos of family members smiling stiffly at the camera. Sunday clothes. Front porches. Names written in faded ink underneath.

I turned the page. The clothes changed. Older now. Dresses longer. Men in suspenders. The dates written in the margins said early 1900s. My last name was still there. Same blood. Same family.That’s when I saw it.


The pendant.


One woman wore it around her neck, clear as day. On the next page, a man had it tucked into his shirt. Then another. And another. Every few pages, that same symbol showed up again, always close to the skin. My hands were shaking by the time I reached the back of the album. Tucked into the last pages were newspaper clippings. Yellowed. Brittle. Headlines about men found dead, names matching the ones in the photos. I didn’t read too close. I didn’t need to. I knew what they were talking about. My stomach turned.
“What you doing in my things?” I nearly dropped the album. Grandma was sitting up in bed, her robe hanging loose, her eyes sharp despite the hour. “You know something,” I said, my voice coming out rough. “You’ve known something this whole time.” She looked at the album in my hands, then back at my face. Her mouth pressed into a thin line.
“Put that down,” she said. “No,” I said. “Not this time. You need to tell me what this is. What’s been happening to me.”


The room felt smaller then, like the walls were leaning in. Grandma stared at me for a long moment, fear flickering across her face before she hid it. Somewhere outside, the swamp shifted, slow and heavy. Grandma sat down hard in her chair like the truth weighed more than her bones. She didn’t look at me at first. She just stared at the floor, hands folded tight in her lap.


“This was a long time ago,” she said. “Back when the law didn’t see us as nothing worth protecting.” I didn’t interrupt her. She continued.“Our family lost three men and a lil boy,” she went on. “Taken right out the parish. Left hanging like warnings.” Her voice stayed steady, but her fingers shook. “It broke us. Folks were scared to leave the house. Scared to speak too loud. Scared to breathe wrong.”
She swallowed.


“One of the women back then, my grandmother, she couldn’t live like that no more. So she went into the swamp. Went where nobody else would. She prayed, but not to God alone. She asked anything that would listen to keep our blood safe.” My mouth felt dry. “And something answered,” Grandma said.


She finally looked at me then. “It promised protection. Said no more ropes, no more mobs, no more men taken before their time. But nothing comes free. That spirit wanted its due.” I asked it before I could stop myself. “What kind of due?” I said, still confused. “A hundred years,” she said. “That’s how long it would guard us. After that, the bargain was done. Whatever hunger it had would be loose again.” The room felt cold. I thought about the dates in the album. About the way the figures had pointed at me.


“The people I saw,” I said quietly. “That was them?” She nodded. “Your ancestors. They stayed close to the water after death. Watching. Waiting. Trying to warn you.” My chest tightened. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“I wanted to see you,” she said. “Wanted to have you here, safe, before the time was up. I didn’t know it would come so soon.”


Her voice cracked, just a little. “I thought maybe the spirit would pass us by. Maybe it already took enough.” Outside, something moved in the swamp, slow and heavy. Grandma reached for my hand, her grip weak but urgent. “You need to understand,” she said. “The protection is gone now. And it knows your name.” Grandma squeezed my hand hard, harder than I thought she could.


“You need to go,” she said. “Right now.”
“What?” I said. “No. I’m not leaving you here.”
Her eyes flashed at me. “That thing is awake,” she snapped. “And it’s hungry. My time already done. I lived long. You ain’t.” I went to her chair, tried to push it back. “I can get you in the car. We can-” She interrupted me. “Boy,” she yelled, loud enough to make me flinch, “get the hell out of my house.”
I froze. I had never heard her raise her voice like that. Not once in my life.


“It wants the blood still walking,” she said, breath shaking now. “Not the ones already half gone. If you stay, it’ll take you. If you don’t, maybe it won’t follow far.”
The house creaked. Something heavy shifted outside, close enough that I felt it more than heard it. “Go,” she said again. Softer this time. “Run.” I grabbed my keys and didn’t even think about shoes. I burst out onto the deck in my pajamas, the boards slick under my feet. The swamp was loud again, too loud, like it was breathing all around me. I ran. I’m not a runner. Never have been. My lungs burned, my legs shook, but I didn’t stop.


I made it to my car, hands slipping as I yanked the door open. It started on the first try. I didn’t look back. I drove too fast down the narrow road, trees whipping past. Then something jumped out in front of me. A deer. Big. Close. I swerved. The car slammed into a tree so hard my head rang. The engine is dead and smoking now.


I've locked the doors. My hands are shaking like crazy. Now I’m sitting here and typing this while I still can. I don’t know exactly where I am. Somewhere outside New Orleans, deep in the bayou. My battery is low. I’ve got barely any service. I can hear it out there. A deep bellow rolling through the water.


It’s getting closer.

1qhhe4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qhhe4q/change_your_body_your_life_in_1_month_4_small/,Change your body & your life in 1 month: 4 small habits that actually work,"If you’ve ever tried to “get your life together” through a 30-day challenge, only to burn out by week two, you’re not alone. Most of us want the glowup, the transformation, the fresh start. But what we get instead is a chaotic mix of unrealistic goals, toxic wellness advice from TikTok, or $400 supplements sold by influencers who don’t even follow their own programs.

Here’s the truth: change doesn’t come from going all in for a week and collapsing. It comes from small, boring, consistent habits. Backed by actual science, not just hot people with ring lights. This post breaks down 4 *tiny* habits that have been tested by researchers, health experts, and productivity authors, and can actually shift your mind, body, and life in just one month.

Use this as a reset that doesn’t burn you out. No hacks. Just real stuff that works.

*Based on insights from top sources like Andrew Huberman’s podcast, James Clear’s “Atomic Habits,” and research from Stanford and Harvard.*

---

* **Start your day with light, movement, and water (before caffeine)**  
This isn’t just “morning routine” fluff. This combo resets your brain’s circadian clock, boosts dopamine, and tells your body “we're awake and alert now.”

  * *According to Dr. Andrew Huberman* (neuroscientist at Stanford), getting 2–10 minutes of natural morning light within 30-60 minutes of waking up dramatically improves mood, energy, and hormonal balance.
  * A 5-minute walk or stretch floods your body with endorphins and primes it for productivity. Combine with water (rehydrates your brain after sleep) before coffee to avoid energy crashes.
  * Huberman calls this “one of the most powerful levers for mental and physical health.” No pills. Just light, motion, and hydration.

---

* **Use the 1-minute rule for clutter, emails, and small tasks**  
Most people drown in mental chaos not because of big problems, but from micro-stressors adding up. The 1-minute rule clears that.

  * Coined by author Gretchen Rubin, the idea is simple: if it takes less than a minute, do it immediately.
  * Behavioral studies by BJ Fogg at Stanford’s Behavior Design Lab show that starting with small “tiny habits” leads to long-term change because they require less willpower.
  * This works amazingly for inboxes, messy kitchens, clothes piles, overdue texts. Do it now, or it multiplies.

---

* **Cut dopamine junk: replace scrolling with “low dopamine” activities**  
We’re not built for 6 hours of TikTok. And it doesn’t even make us happy.

  * A key concept in Dr. Anna Lembke’s *Dopamine Nation* is that overstimulation leads to burnout, numbness, and zero motivation.
  * Try “dopamine detox moments”: replace endless scrolling with simple low-dopamine activities like slow walks, reading, cooking, journaling, or even just sitting and staring out the window.
  * A 2021 *Harvard Business Review* study showed that people who had “tech-free” windows of just 30 minutes a day reported a 26% boost in focus and 48% less burnout.

---

* **Track only 3 things daily: sleep, movement, focus**  
Don’t track 20 health metrics. Your brain will rebel. But three core things drive 80% of how you feel.

  * Sleep: Quantity *and* consistency. Prioritize 7–9 hours, and go to bed+wake up at roughly the same time.  
    *The Sleep Foundation* says even small sleep consistency improves cognition and mood more than sleeping longer.
  * Movement: Doesn’t have to be a gym session. Walks, stretching, or dancing count. Just move for at least 20 minutes.
  * Focus: Set a 25-minute timer (Pomodoro method) and do *one thing*. One study from the University of California Irvine found it takes 23 minutes to refocus after a distraction, so give your brain a break and do fewer, deeper work sessions.

---

That’s it. Four boring, powerful habits.

No 4am wakeups. No $300 planners. No unrealistic “that girl” aesthetics.

Just science-backed mini shifts that can actually change how your body feels, how your brain works, and how your life flows in 30 days.

Start with one. Stack over time. This isn’t magic. But it’s what actually works.

times and places have also changed.  i used to go to a bakery and pick up some day-olds as part of a very specific routine that's now lost to time.  it was day-olds, tim hortons, civic centre, local park/wandering.  that bakery still exists, but it's changed hands and i don't think the routine would be possible simply because of that.  i also used to get out of the house as early as possible in the morning because i smoked and hated the lectures i'd get when i smoked around the house and came back inside after a cigarette.  i don't smoke anymore and haven't in a long time but, if i'm back to this routine, i still want to be out of the house as early as possible.  

i must have had over 9 hours of sleep last night so those numbers are adding up.  i got up to my alarm, which isn't necessarily to wake me up it's to remind me to take my meds.  usually i'm already up by the time this alarm goes off but today it was my wake-up.  i have the most leg cramping in the morning so getting up to pee is the day's first chore.  once i get moving, it's less of an issue but i know if i were at work and this happened it would keep me from doing something in the moment and that could be serious or just annoying for everyone else.  i got a lunch ready for my study session at the library and then, of course, forgot to pack it.  i did at least remember an apple and some clementines and my water bottle so i wasn't hurting desperately when i took a break.

i'm going through some of the best notes in the course and those are the pharmacology ones because they cover medication administration.  if you're 90% of nurses, which means you're in long-term care, that's what you'll be doing most of the time.  keeping your license and working practically, this is the stuff you should have down.  of course, all the physical assessments are also vital and there's a million other things to know, but for practical purposes, those are the two sections i'm starting with: pharmacology and physical assessment.  i spent about 2 hours today on pharmacology and went through the slides of one and a half lectures.  it's not the hardest lifting you could possibly do, but it does take focus and the licensing exam would be about three hours of this type of focus so i'd like to be comfortable with that.

every time i go through my notes, i come away with an increasingly clearer picture of what they actually mean.  for example, medication profiles make more sense even of meds i wasn't studying today.  also, sometimes pieces of a more in-depth puzzle click because of something simple.  for example, opioids having an anticholinergic effect and not just GI receptor activation reducing peristalsis.  why does this matter?  ACTH is associated with the parasympathetic nervous response (rest and digest) which would suggest opioids actually activate the sympathetic nervous system, which they do.  which is sort of counter-intuitive considering it's responses from this system that are associated with acute pain.

after the library i continued my jobless tour with a coffee from tim's (a splurge, to spoil myself because i studied) and off to the first shit zoo (pet store).  you know i don't have a job when i'm at the pet store.  every pet store employee in my area knows when i'm out of work and they see me coming from a mile away.  if i'm unemployed, i'm either at one of those pet stores, the mall, the library or walmart.  i went to every one of those today (well, not every single pet store, i like to stagger them because it gets embarrassing). 

i still have my old mp3 player with all the classic hits but my headphones have a problem with them and only one side works.  this isn't new, this has been an issue for a long time but i can still listen to all the old playlists i made with one ear.  i'm hoping the mp3 player itself is still sound because it's a solid player and i'd hate to have to replace it even if i had the means.  the casing is even metal, not just plastic and it's a sony product.  today i was listening mostly to a 'ghost' playlist from their 'meloria' and 'prequelle' eras.

every time i get a bypass code for my school account, it somehow expires or stops working.  i have to call IT for another yet again.  they're supposed to be good for months, possibly a year but mine's already stopped working.  my last very loose end is having to explain to OSAP why i'm not working yet and i've actually got a lead on how to go about this because of one poor kid in my class who still hasn't passed his licensing exam.  he wrote and failed and apparently has been so nervous over it, he's dropped all sorts of weight, which he couldn't afford to do, he was a skinny kid already.  he writes again on friday so i'm going to ask him after that because i don't want to shoot his nerves even more than they are now with that sort of talk right before his exam. 

wednesday i see my friend from school for coffee and i don't really want to bring much of this up, although they know the gist of what's been happening, i just want it to be the sort of celebratory meeting it should have been to be done with school and on to the next phase of life.

A friend of mine lost their daughter very suddenly and unexpectedly a few months ago. She was only 18 months old. We are in a close knit community and we all go to the park together on weekends and that kind of thing. This friend of mine, we’re not very close, we hang out at the park together with all the other parents, her son is friends with my son, and our daughters were the same age too but not old enough really for friendships. But she’s not like a close friend who we would go out for coffee just the two of us or anything like that. 

I’ve found myself visiting her daughter’s grave several times. I just can’t keep the last time I saw her out of my head, toddling around at the park. I think about her a lot, and even though I’m not so spiritual, something in me just wants to be able to offer her some company and sit with her. I’ve gone 3 or 4 times and each time I go I get a little nervous that I might run into someone from the family, in case it’s weird that I’m visiting. 

I don’t know if what I’m doing is wrong, since I’m not very close with the family, it’s not my grief, I don’t know. So I figured I would ask here - would you feel weird if a not-so-close friend were visiting your child’s grave? Do you feel like it’s the kind of thing that should be reserved for people who had a close relationship with your child? Is it the kind of thing you would want people to ask you permission before ?

Look, Okan, my dear brother,

I've known and loved you for 30 years, since your days as a footballer.

You had a very successful three years at Galatasaray.

You didn't get here easily; you worked very hard.

But I'm saddened to see that some people are exploiting your hard work in 'certain circles'.

Until a year ago, you were living an extremely decent, even respectable, and even devout life, as some would say.

May God accept your prayers.

For the past year, I have been following closely and with sadness how men who have had football careers as long as your age have dragged you into situations where you shouldn't be.

Let me give you a name: Fatih Süleyman Demircan, member of the Board of Directors of Sportif A.Ş.

And this process very clearly shows that it disrupted your concentration first, and then, due to the imam-congregation relationship, the team's concentration.

What are you doing staying up until dawn in hotels and entertainment venues, Okan Buruk?

What are you doing, Okan Buruk, in places you shouldn't be, even in a neighborhood coffee shop, let alone some other venue, before big matches, at hours when you shouldn't be there?

Let me ask even more directly, my dear brother Okan, where were you the night and nights before the 2-0 defeat against Fenerbahçe?

Why are Dursun Özbek and his esteemed administration, who are intimately familiar with all these events, maintaining their silence in the face of these incidents?

Mr. Dursun Aydın Özbek, who knows the Galatasaray community and its reflexes best, will inevitably face a response from Galatasaray's own reflexes if he doesn't put a stop to this situation and intervene.

The complacency from three consecutive championships could lead to very painful consequences.

Hey everyone!  
I wanted to share something I’ve been quietly working on for a while and finally felt brave enough to post here.

I’m a longtime TTRPG player and storyteller, and this project is called **Astralion:** a sci-fi fantasy Campaign Frame built specifically for **Daggerheart**.

Astralion takes place in a living Astral Sea where belief shapes reality, worlds can be born from ideas, and ancient civilizations disappeared during an event called the Great Dissonance. You play as starship crews sailing between strange worlds, dealing with fractured layers of reality and consequences that tend to stick around longer than expected.

Just to be super clear: this frame is meant to sit *on top* of the Corebook, staying fiction-first and in line with the tone and philosophy of the system.  
It adds **12 original Ancestries**, **6 Communities**, new items and tools, and a **narrative-focused starship system** where ships are shared structures shaped by the crew’s choices.

I’m sharing it here because Daggerheart is what inspired the whole thing in the first place, and I’d honestly love feedback from people who actually play and care about the game. Even quick impressions or “this part really worked / confused me” comments would mean a lot.

**Small heads-up:** I’m not a native English speaker, but I did my best to keep everything clear and readable.

**And one last thing:**  
I’m not a graphic designer. I’m a screenwriter who loves building worlds, so I care more about ideas than pixels — but every layout was made with love, patience, and probably too much coffee. Thanks for being kind about it.

If you’re curious, you can check out the PDF here: [Astralion Campaign Frame](https://ko-fi.com/s/69bf41b997)

1qhh3yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qhh3yt/just_another_summer_in_95_pt2/,Just Another Summer In ‘95 pt2,"We both drove back to the station and handed in our gear and changed. I could still smell the faint odor clinging to my uniform. I suppressed the urge to gag as I threw it back into my locker without any finesse, just wanting to get it off me. I changed into a pair of cutoff jean shorts and my UCSD hoodie.

I bumped back into Felix on my way to my car. He was wearing that stupid Denver Broncos windbreaker like it was his best suit. He looked almost as exhausted as me. We both exchanged a tired “hey” to each other.

“I’m going to Norm’s. You wanna come with? I’m buying.”

I tried to let out a chuckle, but it only came out as a weak exhale.

“That old place? Just this once… I-I need a drink,” I stammered, trying to keep it together. Last thing I wanted was to put on the waterworks in front of him. Felix’s gaze softened as he quieted for a moment.

“Me too, Ash…c’mon, I’ll drive, alright?”

I sniffled once, and he put a hand on my back and gently ushered me to his truck. We didn’t say much as we climbed into his truck, and he started to drive toward the town.

I gazed out the dim window into the dark outlines of the pines. My head pounded with the aftershock of pure adrenaline leaving my body. I clenched my fists tightly as I felt my hands continue to tremble. I let out a couple of unsteady breaths to control my breathing; it helped a little. I finally mustered up what little confidence I had and turned toward Felix. His eyes were focused on the road, but I could tell he noticed, with how tightly he clenched his jaw.

“I’m-”

He quickly cut me off before I could finish.

“You have nothing to be sorry for.”

I let out a quiet sigh and let myself relax a little. I wasn’t really in the mindset to argue with Felix. The one question that had been swirling in my mind:

“What…was that?”

Felix’s expression darkened as his eyes flickered to me and then back to the dimly lit road ahead.

“Between you and me…I heard some whispers from the badged rangers about this.”

My brow furrowed as more questions flooded my brain. I turned my head and quietly asked him,

“You knew about this?”

He shook his head a few times.

“I thought it was a spike in chronic wasting or rabies… or anything just not… that.”

I didn’t know what to say, but my hand slid across the center console, just short of touching him. I didn’t know why; I just didn’t want to feel alone after that, just to feel close to someone for a moment. I felt his hand squeeze my arm just for a second before he withdrew his hand.

I retreated my hand back to my seat and stared ahead wordlessly. We didn’t say anything else the entire ride into town. The small town was dead quiet in these later hours of the night. The only place that was still open was that shitty gas station and Norm’s bar.

The truck drove past the main street, if you could call it that. Until we reached the edge of one of the last blocks before it turned into scattered neighborhoods.

On the street corner was our destination: Norm’s, the only place to get a drink besides the old liquor store on the edge of town that closed after seven. It didn’t look like much from the outside: concrete brick walls stained from decades of cigarette smoke and spring thaws, a slightly angled roof to keep the snow from piling up in winter. One-way windows only hinted at the warmth inside, backlit by a flickering neon Coors Light sign hanging above the glass door.

Felix parked along the curb and gave me a nod before stepping out. I didn’t move at first, exhausted in a way I couldn’t even begin to explain. After a weak sigh, I followed him in.

The bar was dimly lit, low-hanging lights casting long shadows across wood-beamed walls. A few regulars sat on worn vinyl stools, nursing nearly-empty beers and clutching half-spent cigarettes. The thick scent of tobacco hit me like a punch to the gut.

We passed through the vestibule into the main bar. A battered jukebox flickered quietly in the corner. Across the room, a doorway opened into a second space I couldn’t quite see. A woodstove, untouched and cold in the summer months, leaned close to the doorway.

Norm leaned against the back counter, the flashing Rainier sign behind him casting a dull red glow across his lined face as he wiped down a glass. Felix settled onto a seat at the bar, but I didn’t follow him, not yet. My gaze drifted to the jukebox as it quietly played For What It’s Worth. For some reason, the usually calming twang of Springfield didn’t quite sit right with me, not tonight.

I quietly cycled through the different CDs, quickly noticing it didn’t have anything newer than ’88. I grumbled softly as I cycled CDs to something my dad liked to listen to on the porch during the weekends: Gimme Shelter.

I dug into my pocket for some loose change and fed the machine a pair of quarters. My gaze shifted as I noticed the dark form of a dog. Maybe a lab if you squinted, laying across his worn bed next to the jukebox. I smiled softly as I watched this dog snore softly as he rested his blocky head on his paws. The jukebox started to play my song. The dog let out what I could best describe as a grumble as he lifted his greying muzzle to gaze up at me. His ears flicked in what might have been a judgmental stare at the jukebox as it played the Rolling Stones tune.

I let myself smile as I kneeled down to him and softly scratched behind his floppy ears.

“Did I wake you? I’m sorry, sweetheart.”

His tail thumped once on the tile floor as he leaned into my hands with another grumble. I peered at his leather collar to see he shared the name of the beer of questionable quality, Busch. I let out a quiet chuckle barely audible even to myself. I patted the lounging dog once more before standing up.

As I walked back, I caught the gaze of one of the regulars just for a moment before he dropped his gaze to his beer. I didn’t linger on this as I sat down at the bar next to Felix.

Norm nodded at me as he poured Felix a draft. When he finished, he turned my way.

Definitely a local through and through; mullet and handlebar stache, faded denim trucker jacket, aviator-style glasses. A black hat with the outline of some Navy ship sat low on his head; the words USS OKINAWA stitched across the front.

“Evenin’, miss. What can I getcha?”

I hesitated a beat.

“Um… just a coffee.”

He raised a bushy eyebrow at the request but didn’t protest.

“Black?”

I nodded quietly. I didn’t bother asking for cream or sugar—wasn’t sure why I hadn’t. Norm grabbed the old coffee pot, probably left simmering on the burner since morning, and poured a mug full of what smelled like the same brand they left out for us at the station; burnt, bitter, and somehow still comforting. He set it down gently on the bar.

I offered a soft “thanks” and let my eyes drift to the bottles lined up behind him.

“I’ll…take a glass of Wild Turkey with it. Neat.”

Norm gave a small, unreadable nod and glanced over at Felix. The two men shared a look, brief but heavy, before he turned back and poured out the bourbon. He placed the glass beside the coffee with a soft clink.

I murmured another thank you and, without ceremony, poured the contents of the glass straight into the mug. I cupped the plain ceramic in both hands, letting the heat soak into my palms before lifting it to my face.

The scent hit me hard: scorched, cheap coffee laced with the sharp bite of mid-shelf whiskey. I took a careful sip.

The bitterness and the burn slid down my throat and bloomed warm in my chest. I let out a soft, strained exhale as the sting settled across the roof of my mouth, like I was breathing through the ache.

I heard a soft grumble from behind me. I craned my head to see the dark form of the bartender’s dog padding over from his bed. He plopped himself against my leg as he flopped over with what I could best describe as a dog sigh. I smiled into the mug and leaned and trailed my fingers along his forehead; he thumped his tail lazily in response.

Felix looked over from his beer at the dog sprawled out on my foot and chuckled a bit. “He must like you.”

“Busch usually only gets up when you drop an egg,” the bartender remarked as he stooped and dug through a mini-fridge, bringing out a bright packet of Wonder Bread.

I shrugged sheepishly and mumbled, “I guess he does-”

On the counter, two jars sat in cloudy liquid, eggs in one, jerky in the other. The brine was so murky it was hard to tell if the eggs had been in there for weeks or years. The strips of meat looked handmade, maybe bison, maybe something else. Something with too many tendons.

The rack nearby sagged under greasy snack bags, but the fluorescent light above it flickered just enough to make the colors look wrong. The pickled sausages looked almost pink in the shifting light, like fingers in vinegar.

The old cigarette machine crouched against the paneling, a faded Kool’s logo glowing faintly above it. No buttons, just brass pull knobs dulled to a sickly bronze. A paper label above the slot warned: “3.50 quarters only,” the ink blurred from years of greasy hands. Behind the warped glass, the packs looked swollen and pale, their colors leeched away, brands barely legible through the plastic haze.

I looked over at Felix as he nursed his lager. He clutched the half-full glass tightly; even now, I could still see his fingers trembling from the aftershock. He wasn’t looking at me, whether because he felt I needed space or he didn’t know what to even say at this point. I couldn’t tell. His gaze was focused on the only TV in the bar.

The blocky CRT hanging behind the bar played a game show that looked familiar, though I couldn’t quite name it. A glamorous blonde in heels and a sparkly red dress moved with the kind of easy, practiced grace that made it look effortless. She walked between glowing panels, flipping them one by one as the audience applauded every nervous guess. The woman was beautiful; tall, slim, with the kind of posture that probably took a lifetime to learn. The tinny bar speakers couldn’t keep up with the canned clapping and chimes, but it didn’t matter. She held the screen just fine without sound.

“You ever wear a dress like that, Ash?” Felix asked, still nursing his beer.

I let out a soft snort. “Please. I don’t have legs like hers.”

Felix chuckled, gave his glass a small tilt. “Didn’t break any hearts back home, Miss San Diego?”

I shook my head, a little quieter now. “Me and dating never really worked out. Not exactly a looker.”

“Hasn’t stopped the newer volunteers from running into trees around you,” he said with a chiding smile.

“They’re just dumb kids, Felix,” I dismissed with a wave of my hand.

“Kids can be pretty honest, Ash,” he replied, matter-of-fact.

“Shaddup, old man,” I grumbled, hiding a forming smile behind my mug as I took a sip.

I quickly caught a familiar smell. The kind that drifts through dorm kitchens back home at UCSD. The aroma of grilled cheese browning on a hot pan. Glancing over, I spotted the bartender cooking a pair of sandwiches on a hot plate tucked into a tiny corner beside a plain white microwave and toaster oven.

He slid two paper plates silently across the bar. one with a freshly made grilled cheese for me, the other a classic hangover special: fried bologna and cheese. I don’t even remember asking for them.

“I didn’t order-” I started quietly, but the handlebar-mustached bartender cut me off.

“Eat, girl. You two look like hell.”

When I asked how much he wanted for them, he just grunted and walked off, busying himself and ignoring my question. I looked over at Felix for help and only got a sheepish smile and a pat on the shoulder.

I looked down at the sandwich and accepted my fate as I started to peel the crusts off by hand. I looked down at my feet to see Busch still snoring away softly. I bent down and offered him some of the crusts. I felt a warm breath against my hand as he sniffed it. Without opening his eyes, he gently took it from my hand and chomped away. I smiled softly as I fed him the rest of the peeled crusts. I took a few bites and let myself sink a little further into that bar stool.

Just as I was beginning to relax, I heard a sound I normally paid hardly any attention to, but this time it made my spine tense like a bear trap snapping shut. The sound of rotors cutting through the temperate summer air. Through the windows, I saw the shape of a helicopter flying low, sweeping the treeline. Its spotlight searched for any movement in the brush. The strobes flashed dimly as the red and green directional lights glowed steadily. The windows of the bar began to shake as its engines shrilled, drowning out any sounds of warmth.

The dark form of the bar dog raised his head and stared out at that chopper. He didn’t make a sound as he watched it comb the treelines. His ears perked and his eyes focused. The chopper finally turned, and that’s when I saw a dim blue light illuminating a golden star and dim black writing that read “Montana Highway Patrol.” It started to gain altitude as it passed over the bar with a shriek. The rumbling of the spinning blades shook my very core.

In the distant interstate, I could see the red and blue lights flashing wildly as the shapes of emergency vehicles tore down the highway toward the woods. The howling of the sirens echoed in the distance. I felt a hand grab my shoulder gently, but I couldn’t look away.

I didn’t say much after that. I finished my drink and noticed Felix had already paid the tab before I could react. We just exchanged a look and knew we both wanted to leave. We bid a muffled farewell to Norm as we exited the bar. The streets of Ravenwood still carried the distant, shrill calls of the sirens deep within the woods.

Felix offered to drive me home. I didn’t exactly have any reason to say no to him. I wish I could say something else happened on the drive back, but nothing did. I just remember staring out at nothing in particular as we passed the shadowy forms of closed storefronts and isolated houses.

When we finally pulled into the small collection of staff cabins, he turned to me as he was about to make his farewell, but I stopped him as I could feel my hands starting to shake again.

“Can you stay… just till morning-”

Felix looked at me in surprise for a moment before softening his expression.

“You sure?”

I nodded, and he let out an exhale.

“Alright, I’ll crash on the couch.”

I smiled a little, feeling a little safer knowing I wouldn’t be alone tonight despite his hesitation to stay.

As we both went inside the little cabin, I took in the familiar scent of cheap wood as I tried to make myself at home.

A cabin was a strong word. It wasn’t like the polished cabins you saw on the lake with handmade wooden furniture marketed as a romantic getaway for couples. It was basically a shack with a tiny kitchen, stuffed with furniture from the 70s that the feds bought for cheap, and a cot with a blue mattress that looked like it had been dragged from Camp Pendleton.

Felix settled on the ugly yellow-and-green plaid couch that I internally gagged at every time I set my eyes on it. I took a short shower that somewhat dampened the smell of ammonia lingering on my skin before getting ready for bed, changing into some comfy shorts and a loose-fitting tank top, and finally letting my hair down. The rancid smell was now replaced by the stale air and musty upholstery.

I looked over at Felix as he lounged in his makeshift sleeping spot on the sofa, eyeing the CRT adorned with bunny ears. His eyes flickered to me as I stood there in my pajamas.

“Heading to bed?”

“Yeah… Felix, I-”

The experienced ranger sat up to fully regard me, as he could infer I was about to say something that I had been wanting to say for a while.

“Thank you… for everything tonight. If you hadn’t been there, I probably wouldn’t be-”

He stopped me from continuing, already knowing where I was going with this.

“Ashley, there’s nothing good that will come from thinking about what could have happened.”

“I know…” I said, letting out a deep sigh.

“I’ll be here, okay? Just try to get some sleep, hun.”

“Right…night, Felix.”

“Night, Ash.”

I padded off to the little bedroom they had and tried to get comfortable in bed. The dark green wool blanket from the surplus store smelled like mothballs and not much else, but somehow…it didn’t make me itchy like it usually did.

I lay there for what felt like hours. My eyes just tried to drift away into sleep after this hellish day, but despite my best efforts, my fatigue wouldn’t take me. I couldn’t stop thinking about that thing in the woods. Its endless teeth as it opened its horrific jaws, the way it thrashed and twitched after Felix shot it, the smell that clung to my uniform and my skin. I sat up, rubbing my face, the images of what I saw not leaving my head.

Giving up on sleep entirely, I climbed out of bed and wandered into the dimly lit common area. Felix still sat on the couch wrapped up in a fleece blanket, as the washy colors from the Philips washed over his exhausted face. The CRT quietly murmured a late-night rerun of Are You Being Served? I padded over and sat close by him as the sitcom whispered a canned laugh track.

“Can’t sleep?” he said without looking at me.

I shook my head, and he smiled almost sadly.

“Yeah, me neither,” he said with a heavy sigh.

I didn’t say anything, but without thinking I found myself leaning on him as I felt myself start to shiver, but not from the cold. As the actors on screen, marinated in hairspray, rattled out British culture references and jokes from the 70s I didn’t understand, I felt the blanket being draped around me, just like I did for Jess. The fridge buzzing in the background became the only backdrop besides the TV set.

I don’t know when I fell asleep on Felix’s shoulder, but whatever small comfort he brought seemed to be enough to lull me into a surprisingly restful slumber. If I had any nightmares that night, they burned away from my memory as soon as the sun rose above the horizon.

When the morning finally washed over us, I found myself making a breakfast from back home that brought a little comfort to me: Rancheros huevos. Despite Felix looking at it strangely, he ate it without protest and said it reminded him of Indian tacos. Though I wasn’t sure what that even was, it was just nice to cook for someone again.

After breakfast, Felix drove me back to the station to pick up my car. Before we parted ways, I embraced him. It felt like hours, but in reality it was probably only a couple seconds. He told me to stay out of trouble, but I couldn’t let him see my eyes when I said I would.

Instead of just leaving in my car to wallow in what happened last night, I found myself drawn to the swinging glass doors of that shabby ranger station. Every part of me just told me to leave it to the pros. I’m just a college girl who works seasonal here. What good could I possibly do after what happened? Despite all these doubts circling like a tornado, my legs marched toward those double doors. But…I know I could never forgive myself if I left.

Despite how much busier the station was than usual, I slipped past most of the rangers without any of them even asking where I was going. Phones seemed to be ringing on end as badged rangers with rifles over their shoulders hauled heavy trunks of gear in and out of the station like worker ants. I stopped in front of Jake’s office, realizing this was my last chance to turn back.

I rested my knuckles on the polished wooden door before rapping three times on it. I heard a tired murmur to enter. The scent of cheap tobacco hit me as soon as I entered the cluttered office. Jake sat behind his desk, eyes bloodshot as he cradled a landline across his neck. He lazily blew out plumes of smoke through the half-cracked window at his side. His eyes flickered to me as he gestured to the chair in front of his desk, bidding me to sit. He clenched his jaw as he listened to what was said on the other end. He let out a deep sigh before muttering a “thank you” into the receiver and hanging up.

His hand rubbed his face as he attempted to smooth over his disheveled hair. My eyes flickered to the mug bearing the arrow-like mark of the forestry service. Many rings of stale coffee colored the inside, as a few drops of tar that had long since gone cold lingered at the bottom.

We both drove into the shadowed trail, the last remnants of daylight fading behind the pines. Stephanie led the way, her high-vis vest and gear catching the dim moonlight as she moved with quiet precision. The forest was almost too still, the usual hum of insects and distant birds gone. I felt a creeping tension build in my chest, my stomach twisting with anticipation.

Suddenly, the sharp scent of ammonia hit me again. My breath hitched, and I tried to warn her.

“Steph, I can-” I began, but she cut me off in a measured, tight voice.

“Keep walking,” she said.

The smell intensified as we continued, burning my nostrils. Nausea began to rise, my legs trembling. Then, a sharp sound; branches snapping, but heavier than anything we’d expect from the forest floor. Limbs from higher up, strong and deliberate.

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught movement. I turned, and regret hit immediately. Before I could react, Stephanie’s hand clamped over my mouth. Her eyes, steel-hard and unblinking, fixed on something in the treeline.

I followed her gaze, reluctantly. There it was, a nightmare made flesh. Skittering between the trees with an unnatural gait, its body composed of borrowed limbs and heads of creatures I knew too well. Spider-like in form, towering over the young firs.

Stephanie slowly released her hand, still staring at the abomination.

“Don’t run now, hun. It’ll chase you faster than a grizzly with cubs,” she whispered gravely.

My heart pounded so loudly it nearly drowned out the forest. My shaking hand went toward my holster, but Stephanie’s firm squeeze stopped me.

“Don’t- that little peashooter will just piss it off,” she murmured.

I glanced at the rifle in her hands, knees weakening.

“What do we do… can’t you just shoot it?” I whispered shakily. She tilted her head slightly toward me and let out a soft, almost amused giggle.

“Oh bless your heart… this .308 wouldn’t put something down this big. Speaking of—” She suddenly handed the rifle to me.

“W-what? What are you doing…?” I stammered, helpless, as the creature’s wolf-like head twisted unnaturally to watch us, gums pulled back in a snarl.

“Just trust me, Ashley. Stay real still now,” she said, her voice firm. She reached across her belt, drew a bulky metallic flare pistol not a little orange plastic one like in a regular emergency kit, but the type found on a Coast Guard cutter and loaded a shell with a soft thump.

The thing’s heads locked onto us with pure white eyes, opening their maws in unison. The sound was a horrifying symphony: a wolf’s howl, a raven’s caw, the shrill scream of a mountain lioness, the bellow of a bull elk, and the mournful call of a loon across a lake. It pounded in my chest, echoing through my skull.

The flare pistol clicked as the hammer pulled back, deafening in its sudden intensity. Stephanie exhaled sharply and raised it.

The abomination charged, strafing between trees. Its disproportioned limbs clawed at the soil and bark for leverage.

A loud crack rang out, and I flinched. Smoke trailed in the air as the flare slammed into the creature with a fleshy thud. A muted pop followed, and then a savage hiss as it ignited. The forest filled with the smell of burning fur and gunpowder.

The flare burned like a miniature sun as the creature screamed and thrashed, its limbs scrabbling through the dirt as it fled, the signal round still searing against its flesh. Its cries faded into echoes as the trees swallowed its form. My heart and ears still rang from the intensity of it all.

Stephanie stood still for a moment, then retrieved the rifle from my grasp. Her hand gently guided me back toward camp, words unnecessary. The sun set further behind the horizon, twilight swallowing the trail.

Ahead, patrol cars formed a line, their lightbars fused into a makeshift barrier. A state trooper stood in front with a shotgun across his chest, campaign hat silhouetted against the glow. Families in cars reluctantly turned around, following his wide gestures with a Maglite. Other troopers lingered, spotlights sweeping the treeline.

Stephanie and I exchanged a glance. She sighed, exhausted.

“C’mon, ain’t no use staring. Let’s get you something to eat back at camp,” she said, her voice carrying an uncharacteristic tightness.

Back at camp, we settled around a small fire. Stephanie rested in a folding chair, her hat on her knee. Her silver-streaked bun loosened, and she brought a cigarette to her lips, only for it to tumble from her shaking fingers. She cursed softly and clenched her fist. I didn’t comment and instead heated some ramen over a sterno.

I finally spoke up, voice shaking.

“How…How can you be so calm about this?”

Stephanie’s silver eyes met mine as she lit her retrieved Zippo.

“You get used to it,” she said dismissively.

“That’s it? You just get used to it?” I asked incredulously.

“Well…Before all this happened, us badged folks didn’t exactly do what y’all seasonals do and go home. You ever been up to Yellowstone?”

“Maybe once, I think?” I replied, raising an eyebrow.

“You know those thermal pools?” she asked. I nodded.

“Back in ’81, when I was a pretty young thing like you… a couple went off-trail near the pools to find somewhere to skinny dip. You know…”

“Yeah…” I sighed, rubbing my neck.

“Well, the boyfriend got close to test the water and fell right in. Didn’t even scream much. But she sure did when she ran to get us.”

“Was he-”

“Dead? I wish that was all he was,” she said softly, a hollow smile on her sun-tanned face.

“Jesus…” I muttered.

“By the time we got there? The pool was sludge, reeking like pennies. Nothing to pull out besides a few clumps of hair and ripped cloth… and that smell.”

“They must have closed the park…” I mused aloud, staring at the floating block of instant noodles in my mess cup.

Stephanie grinned like a shark, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

“Think so? Nah, all they did was add another sign and…That was that. Family tried to sue, but it got dismissed.”

“That’s…Awful,” I said, unsure what else to say.

Stephanie nodded before continuing.

“Sure, but it’s just another thing to deal with. Just like the chimera, the bears, and the tourists.”

“The chimera?” I asked, finally looking up.

“That’s what we call it. Like that old Greek story. That thing’s been prowling since last April. First it took a hunter in his deer stand, then a hiker here and there. Those drunk kids are probably next. At this point, they’re probably all dead,” she stated flatly, with clear confidence in her words.

“How can this happen? Why don’t they…Shut down the park?”

Stephanie finally softened, meeting my gaze.

“I wonder that too, most nights.”

I didn’t respond, staring at the campfire crackling in the night. She let out a plume of smoke before sagging her shoulders.

“Ash, honey, you should get some rest. You had a long day,” she added gently.

I managed a smile and muffled “goodnight” before plopping onto one of the foldable cots. For some reason, I was actually able to sleep better tonight. I wasn’t sure why, but I didn’t care. I wished I could say that would be my worst night.",1,1768857559.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I'm an Indian grad student who has been traveling solo long enough to realize that watching epic sunsets alone makes me feel like I’m in a very artistic but slightly sad documentary.

I love spontaneous travel, be it mountains, beaches, waterfalls, sunsets, anywhere that makes you stop walking and go “okay yeah, that was worth it.” I also love exploring new cafes and bars. A bit reserved in the beginning, but I loosen up once I get comfortable.

* Someone, ideally around my age.
* Someone who wants to actually go places together, not just trade travel tips we’ll forget.
* Down to meet for coffee first to do a responsible vibe check.

I'm skipping physical appearance since this is not a dating post, but happy to share pics in chat so we both know the other exists.

If you’ve ever wanted to chase sunsets, see waterfalls, and have someone else confirm “yes, this is indeed very cool,” let’s grab coffee and see if we travel well together.

Our marriage was great for years we met young and were madly in love. Although recent events opened my eyes to how emotionally neglected I've been over those years. While pregnant with our forth child we fought a lot because I was heavy pregnant working and taking care of the home and he would never help, wouldn't take the bins out or do a dish. I threw him out 1 day when I caught him taking a picture of my messing home after I finally went on strike and refused to clean while sick. He said he took the photo to show me on a later date when I deny being dirty (I see now how abusive this is)

8 years into our marriage he lost his job due to his own negligence. He was fired, we lost our home, and everything changed.

I had a six-week-old baby and couldn’t take time off work because we lost an income. We moved back in with emotionally abusive parents. During this time, my husband became emotionally dismissive and avoidant. Emotional neglect slowly became normal.

Six months into his new job, I discovered he’d formed an emotional relationship with a 21-year-old coworker. It involved frequent private texting, emotional support to her, flirting, gaggifts/coffees, and multiple one-on-one lunches at work he hid from me. (3 with a group, 3 alone) He also asked her not to tell me about the lunches.

What broke me was seeing messages he sent to his friend. He wrote that the 21-year-old had “asked him to choose — talking to her or staying happily married,” and that his “head was going a million miles an hour.”

When I confronted him, he said he never actually considered choosing, and that he only sent that message “for an ego boost.”

But when I spoke to her directly, she said something different. She said he asked her if it was okay if they stopped talking, and told her “I can’t text anymore — only machine part numbers at most,” then asked “is no more lunch okay?”

That doesn’t sound like shutting her down — it sounds like leaving the choice open. He claims he did it that way as he was scared she'd try and get him fired if he hurt her feelings as it took him 1.5 years to get this job after losing last.

The truth came out in pieces over weeks:

first I found all the text (he didn't delete them) then he hid their messages after I confronted her which she asked him in a text ""you can just tell me what you want, what you feel, what you need, what I fucking have to do to make everyone calm, what is it?"" He deleted these and deleted their entire chain after I told her I knew and I only found out pieces when I asked her to send her copies to me. I'm not sure what she left out. She claims she sent all.

2 weeks later he finally admitted to lunches only after I kept asking if there was more as I just felt it because why else would she feel so connected to someone she only flirted with. She also confessed he told her not to tell me about their lunches as I couldn't handle it yet and she lied for him

I don’t believe he would have stopped if I hadn’t caught him.

Now he says he’s sorry and that it won’t happen again but he refuses to give me his iCloud password, saying it’s about privacy and feels invasive.

After emotional neglect, hidden lunches, asking another woman to lie, and only stopping once exposed, I’m struggling to know what’s real.

TlDR

Can I believe him after all the added lies?

How do you rebuild trust when honesty only comes after being caught — and when he won’t offer transparency?

How do I trust this won’t happen again? I'm in pieces but still love him. Why am I so weak?",4,1768856735.0,marriageadvice,6,1.0,False

According to gaby if a wall cupboard is to high to reach then you need to stand on something of course nobody would known that until gaby said it.

If you ever go to a hotel take the tea bags  home with you and when you get home put them in a nice tin.

However, over the last couple of years, I’ve noticed a sort of fetishisation of his persona—mainly by Western men (often on the wealthier side) who try to Bourdainmaxx their lives - and by extension, their Instagram and TikTok accounts - by believing that Bourdain was all about “drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes in a cool European café while wearing a leather jacket” or “visiting Southeast Asia and doing slightly local stuff while wearing a white linen shirt.”

Of course, both of these are cool activities—and they certainly make for more appealing Instagram posts than typical tourist attractions, but by focusing on the cool yet surface-level image of Bourdain, they ignore what actually made him so appealing as a person. That, of course, was his personal experiences and struggles, none of which can be replicated by someone else.

It was an hour interview and originally, I was supposed to meet with the VP from 1-1:30PM then with 2 directors from 1:30-2PM. I got an email this morning saying the VP is sick and won’t be able to interview and the two directors would be separate - one at 1-1:30 then the other at 1:30-2PM. 

I joined the call at 1PM and no one was there. I waited until about 1:35PM and was caught off guard when both of them joined. I mentioned I was confused about what happened and they said they read the times wrong and apologized. 

Since they already joined the call a little late, the interview went a little past 2PM but one of them even left the meeting early because she said she had to jump to another meeting. I’m a little disappointed and annoyed because they barely asked any questions (maybe 3?). 

I had a coffee chat with one of the interviewers back in November and I messaged her through LinkedIn to send a thank you note basically thanking her for her time and said I enjoyed our conversation even though it was limited. I said I’m open to providing more information.

She replied with that she enjoyed the conversation and said it’s usually not how they operate at the company then she said: “Even though our time was limited today, I think we were both were able to ask all of the questions on our lists, but we will reach out if we think of anything.” - is this good or am I cooked? 😓

The first interview I had was with the supervisor and the recruiter said the feedback was extremely positive and they actually mentioned this in my second interview.

I also emailed the recruiter stating what happened and said if any additional interviewing is needed, I’m happy to share my availability. I feel like if I didn’t make it to the next it would be unfair because not only was my time limited, I also didn’t even get to interview with the VP who was sick so how did they get a fair evaluation of me?

I’ve never been hospitalized, and I’ve spent most of my life unmedicated, unless you count the weed.

This is not the first time I’ve been depressed and unfortunately lately I have had suicidal thoughts. As long as I exercise, I can keep those thoughts at bay. I have a stable job, lots of friends, and I’m typically upbeat and happy. Ive always excelled academically and have had no issues finding jobs.

1qhgixv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhgixv,Hario Neo vs OG Ceramic V60,"Ive conducted a side by side PO comparison to the best of my abilities.  I am not a professional cupper or coffee taster, but I did my best to slurp audibly. 

Note: The scale says .1 difference but they were both dancing back and forth on that .1 so Im confident they were near identical in weight. 

Recipe was close to the James Hoffman 3 pour recipe. With a 30 second 50g bloom with a pickup swirl. 15:254 at 93 degrees.

The coffee was from Pirates of Coffee in Mississauga Ontario.  They also have a presence in Dubai apparently.  Their “loco” series is outstanding and I really recommend looking them up! This a very funky coffee, which I am always hunting for.

Drawdown was 10 seconds faster for the Neo, so not drastic, and may even be attributable to the arrangement of the grinds in the filer. I usually try to do an inverted cone for maximum contact during bloom.

Tasting: I found the OG V60 to be brighter, with more clear fruit flavours, and sweeter. The Neo felt like more body and less clarity, but also delicious. I would guess the Neo was more dissolved solids, but it was the same filter for both cups and I don’t have a refractometer to prove this. They are both much brighter compared to Aeropress with this coffee, with the Neo in the middle. Again I am not an expert so I’m not comfortable trying to get into more detail than that! 

Ive had the Neo for 2 weeks and still getting accustomed to it. Whether or not it is better is still tbd! But I love how it looks and new tools are always fun. ",2,1768856285.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

1qhggyw,https://i.redd.it/rmrgx5ljddeg1.png,V2 Of The Integrated Biomass Hydro Combined Cascade (IBHCC) - A Universally Compatable Zero Waste Redesign Of Our Shamefully Inefficient Steam Based Energy System,"&#x200B;

(The text below Is copied from the fine print found on the bottom left hand side of the schematic)

\# Change Notes & Hydro Cycle Clarification

\* The hair dryers have been replaced by a single electromagnetic pulse pump. A small 35 w model should be more than sufficient to run both hot and cold air lines, while also pressurizing the final output line. 

\* Flow paths have been streamlined & the Ascension silo has been adjusted to prevent back pressure.

\* While just venting, the hot and cold air paths can be used to heat / cool / pressurize other systems

\* The side tank was switched to the WYE configuration to increase efficiency while demonstrating enhanced flow dynamics

\* The pinwheel has been replaced by a scale steam turbine, this way rather than simply showing a single led light on the hydro side, multimeters can be used to show the true power difference between the two cycles in real time. 

\## 1. The Switch: Thermodynamics \\rightarrow Fluid Dynamics

\* The system uses two different branches of physics for two different goals:

\* \*\*Thermodynamics (Transport):\*\* The Top Cycle (high-grade heat) drives the primary turbine. The waste steam from that cycle hits the re-vaporizer (heated by the reactor/calciner), creating the buoyancy to lift the water up the silo. Heat is used solely to move mass against gravity.

\* \*\*Fluid Dynamics (Power):\*\* Once the water condenses in the top tank, thermal physics ends. The system becomes a hydraulic engine. The energy extraction is now defined by flow convergence and pressure stacking in the mixing chamber, not by the heat of the fire.

\## 2. Decoupled Capacity: The Replenishment Ratio

\* The fire does not drive the System 2 turbines; it only maintains the water level.

\* \*\*The ""Battery"":\*\* The triangular tank array acts as a capacitor for potential energy.

\* \*\*Inventory Management:\*\* The steam cycle’s only job is to replace the specific volume of water leaving the precision nozzle.

\* \*\*The Multiplier:\*\* If your waste heat lifts 100 GPM of condensate, and each nozzle only releases 10 GPM to generate power, you can run 10 independent tank systems. The limit is not the tank size, but the cumulative replenishment cost (total flow rate).

\## 3. The ""Turbocharger"" Mixing Chamber

\* Instead of a vertical squeeze, the system uses a Triangular Geometry where two distinct pressure streams converge in a mixing chamber directly above the nozzle:

\* \*\*Stream A (The Cold Ram):\*\* The Top Tank provides the massive hydraulic head pressure, pressurized further by the cold air/steam draft from the silo pushing down on the liquid surface.

\* \*\*Stream B (The Hot Turbo):\*\* The Side Tank (connected via a WYE or T-junction) uses water from the main tank to compress a second trapped air spring. This air pocket is thermally supercharged by waste heat & liquid / gaseous fractionated bio-fuel, expanding violently to shoot water into the junction.

\* The vacuum of the side tank draining is capitalized on by installing a parasitic feeder tube between the two tanks, keeping the side arm full as long as the main head tank continues to be resupplied 

\* \*\*Result:\*\* These two flows slam together in the Mixing Chamber. The hot, high-velocity stream from the side turbocharges the heavy, high-pressure stream from the top, ejecting the combined flow through the precision nozzle with a force far greater than simple gravity could achieve.

We are in a live-in for 6 months in another city. We had a huge fight with him wanting to break up saying he doesn’t love me one night- I cried a lot, tried to convince him to stay and then he cried as well and then both exhausted decided to go to sleep

I stayed up a little more, trying to accept the situation.

Next morning, although I did hate it I had resigned myself to accepting it when he said he really regrets the breakup saying he has been under a lot of pressure and feeling alone (he had to take wfh when me moved, hoping to find a job after moving but hasn’t) and I don’t seem to understand that and when he wants to travel back home he can’t for more time because I’m not comfortable with that (i do have a job here but no friends or anybody to talk to. Also it seemed like he was always looking to escape) 

We both resolved it that day after he said he regrets it and promised to work towards these issues. But he said he won’t promise he won’t fall out of love or this relationship. Bothered me, made me feel unsure so as a break we both traveled back to our home city with saying lets take some time apart to think on this.

Two days in, we decide to talk about this once and for all over coffee.

Took his phone show this reel i sent when we meet while having a normal catching up conversation and I find him talking to another girl, flirting. No sexual talks but enough to know it wasn’t innocent chatting either. Conversation started innocently a day before he broke up with me, regretted it and took some time apart to process. During the whole process it went from innocent to flirting.

The whole chat itself doesn’t bother me as much as the fact that he was talking to her the whole time we were trying to work us out. Texted her in the morning same time he did me, was flirting while I was giving him space and the night before the meet up when I was telling how in my head I am with anxiousness and panic and he was saying the same back he was simultaneously talking to her and he told me goodnight but kept talking to her for another hour or so.

He regrets it and says its got nothing to do with our problems. We are still working our problems out and then this. This is the first time this has happened but I still don’t want to dismiss it easily. Having said that I do want this relationship if we work it out. The question is should I?

Today's Pick: **Golden Knights -1.5**

**$DKNG**: **+115**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.15U

League: Philadephia Flyers vs Golden Knights (7PM CST on ESPN+)

**Recap**: Got cooked in the 1st half! Did not expect that many scores in the 1st half! I mean it was a defensive game but a lot of turnovers leading into points. I was expecting a defensive games where they stop drives, 3 and out and punts, not defensive games in forcing fumbles and INTs close to the redzone. It is what it is. I needed a miracle in the 2nd half and there was a glimmer of hope as there wasn't a lot of scoring in the 2nd half, but got cooked towards the end. The 1st Half U 20.5**❌** for plus was also cooked.

**Matchup:** I suppose I could go to the CFB since it is the most demanding and popular game for today, but I just can't give you a wager wit the utmost confident on that game. I think the Hoosiers win, but that 7 Point spread could be troublesome, so I'm going to hot key today.

I'm taking the Knights -1.5 against the Flyers. VGK is on a tear right now and Flyers are on a downswing. The Knights have won 7 straight games and they covered the PL 5 of their last 7 games. Conversely the Flyers have loss their last 6 games and was unable to cover the PL in any of those 6 games. Flyers do have a decent 10-9-3 road record but they are just smoked and VGK is smoking their opponents, gotta ride wit the hottest team right now in Hot Key.

I think Eichel has a big game today (maybe a hat trick) and VGK blows out the Flyers at home.

**The Play & Prediction :** If you want the safer wager it's VGK ML or I suppose VGK 60-Min ML (-135 on $DKNG), but there shouldn't be a reason why VGK puts this game away early and possibly go up 3 goals. Knights lead 2-1 late in the 3rd period and Flyers pull their goalie as the VGK hits the empty netter at the buzzer.

1qhgek4,https://i.redd.it/wdk15wv3ddeg1.png,The other woman,"Mike didn't look at me while we fucked. I could've been anyone, anything. 

Afterwards, I dressed, quiet and quick. He was perched on the corner of the bed, smoking and staring at the floor. I watched the way his spine moved when he stretched. The way he chewed the tiny strip of skin away from his finger. 

\*Should I ask?\*

\*No. Not again.\*

But...

""Did you want to--""

Mike stood up and walked out the room. The bathroom door clicked shut. The hiss of the shower.

Perhaps he didn't hear me.

\+++

Mike came home late. 

At the door, I greeted him with a smile. He became annoyed because I couldn't conceal my sadness.

""You're upset,"" he said, walking past me into the house. 

""You said six.""

""Maybe,"" he said, taking to the stairs. ""Why's it matter, Sarah?""

I looked to the kitchen. Dinner was cooked, but it had already gone cold. 

""I don't know.""

He frowned. ""Okay."" 

Then, he went upstairs. A door slammed somewhere in the house. 

I curled up on the sofa under a blanket. 

\*Why did he smell like that?\*

\+++

Pancakes. He pushed a stack in front of me. Then, he turned back to the stove.

""You didn't come to bed.""

I didn't answer. Just watched the little motes of dust sparkle in the red morning light. 

""I'm sorry,"" he said, sitting opposite and pouring a cup of coffee. 

""It's okay.""

He nodded, knowing it wasn't. 

""When will you be back tonight?""

He shrugged, pushed a wedge of food into his mouth and chewed.

""Shall I cook?""

""No, I'll eat out."" 

""Okay.""

A glance at his watch, a final gulp of his drink, then he left.

I cleaned away our dishes. My meal, uneaten.

\+++

It was dark when he returned. I heard the car rumble up the driveway then sigh when he cut the engine. 

The front door opened then slammed. Mike's footsteps sounded clumsy, uneven.

\*Drunk\*.

I shook my head and rolled over so my back faced the bedroom door. I took in a deep breath and listened, hoping his footsteps would stop and he'd pass out on the sofa rather than take to the stairs.

More footsteps. A low grunt. And...the sound of something being dragged. 

I sat up and turned on the bedside lamp. 

More strange noises from downstairs.

""Mike?"" 

Silence. 

I threw off the covers, approached the door and grabbed the handle.

""Sarah!"" 

I froze.

""Yes?""

""Don't come down.""

I let go of the door handle. Slowly backed away.

\*It must be happening again.\*

""Okay,"" I said, though I doubt he heard.

I crept back into bed, put my ear buds in and closed my eyes so tight it hurt. 

\*Please be quick this time.\*

\+++

In the morning, I could see where he'd cleaned the dirt from the hallway carpet. With some bleach, I managed to work out the more stubborn stains. I was at least grateful he hadn't kept it in the house. Must've headed off before sunrise to rebury it.

I didn't see him all day. I didn't mind. I had things to do. Medication to pick up.

The doctor was reluctant to prescribe more antibiotics. He stared at me for a long time before finally signing the paper.

""We rarely see this kind of infection,"" he said. Disgust in his eyes.

""Okay.""

I could tell he wanted to ask me a question, but decided to ask something safer. ""Are you practicing safe sex?""

I scoffed, then felt a sickly pinch in my gut. ""I'm married.""

""Yes..."" He nodded absently. A shadow swept across his face. Then, he pressed out a smile and handed me the slip. ""This will help with the discomfort and keep the bacteria at bay. Though, we really need to figure out why this keeps coming back.""

I blew out a shaking breath and nodded. I left quickly, then cried in the car. The receptionist knocked on the car window, grimacing at the sight of my grief. In my haste, I'd left my handbag. She apologised. For what, I don't know. 

I drove around for an hour before heading home. Thankfully, he wasn't there when I returned.

\+++

At dinner, Mike asked me a haunted question. 

He hadn't long returned and, from the dirt smeared across his face, I knew where he'd been.

""I want you to meet her,"" he said, eventually breaking our silence.

I dropped my fork. A breath caught in my throat. ""What?""

""She's outside. In the car."" 

He reached a hand out to mine. I withdrew.

""Why is this happening again? I thought you burned it.""

""\*It\*?""

There was an edge to his voice. His hand curled into a fist. His jaw clenched tight.

I looked down at my plate. ""What do you want me to do?""

""I'd like you to allow me to bring her inside.""

I let out an incredulous laugh. ""Inside? Didn't you do that last night? Why only \*now\* are you concerned with my feelings on the matter?""

I stood up and turned to leave. 

""\*Sarah\*.""

I froze, then turned to meet his stare. 

""I'm asking if you could join us.""

\*Join? This was madness, was it not? He was sick and growing sicker. How could I continue to allow this, to entertain this?\*

""Please,"" he said with those same soft eyes from years forgotten, ""I want to share this with you. Because I love you.""

\*If I said yes, would he really love me again?\* I doubted it. Love: just another hole to throw my soul in. I \*certainly\* picked them.

\*Why? why was I not...enough?\*

Maybe she was skinnier than me. Had fuller lips or perkier tits. 

I shuddered at the prospect of cold and grey skin between us. Limbs loosely flopping at strange angles while Mike grunted and whispered in our ears.

I wondered what he'd expect me to do. Simply watch or...participate. 

""So..."" he said, lifting my face gently to look at him, ""can I bring her inside?""

My heart ached, knowing there was only one answer.

""Sure.""

A smile split his face. Boyish excitement and giddy movements. He rubbed those filthy hands together.

***A BTS of My Mini-Journey Subtitling Process-ish.***

※**The Backstory of the Journey**※

Back on the 4 January, u/Silver-Bus5724 popped in and asked if I would be interested in translating the drama.  This drama has been languishing around with awful subtitles and low quality, but there are fans of the genre, so worth translating.  Plus, she wrote a great VV for it but only had a very poor-quality video to link.

Being on my upward trajectory on the learning curve of subtitling, I said ""sure, why not!""  I had been s..l..o..w..l..y learning the various pieces of software. For my maiden voyage, I had selected a **Wu Tian Hao** jie-jie drama that had less than stellar subtitles. It was going to be my success-or-failure goal, my hill to die on.  False starts abounded, but! I did do a Japanese movie in-between, so there is that. [It was not a totally A to Z project, but I got to employ what I had been learning. Ta da!]

The Difficulties:  The OG YT-file was 240p in quality.  Chinese burned in titles were not outlined or shadowed.  White in color [difficult to see if against a light-colored background].  It was a struggle.  A really big struggle.  But remember that hill.... yep. It was my Everest.  After a few days of struggling, I mentioned in Tech Chat about the file quality and sub issue, **Icy** popped in and said, ""Drop the title, we'll take a look to see what we can find.""  Icy struck gold! A 720x1080p quality file.  Yes! 🥳 Success may be within my grasp! [I think Icy's reaction when she heard about the file quality was one of pity. 😆.  Silver was apologetic over the OG file quality.]

So on the 9th, I started this project again.  And then, I started it again in a different way. In the process I learned another piece of software, some new terms, some other technical stuff, did some research, used Shazam, and leaned on the **Tech Chat Group.** They held me up beautifully, I might add.

Tweaked, tweaked some more, and then a little bit more. And I finally said, Finished! Well, I said Finished! one more time.  The last time was for a watermark redo and upgrade.  The other thing I would have liked to incorporate, would taken too much time and I wanted to launch this drama into the wild.

The 19th of January 2026 may not be an auspicious date for anything other than the publishing of this newly subtitled drama. And I'm okay with this!

If this drama is your cup of tea/coffee/boba-tea/martini/G&T/beer/fruit-juice/fizzy/H20 or other libation of your choice ... I hope you enjoy it!  Even if it isn't, please take a moment or five to appreciate my first full-length translation. 😘

📑 I think this drama was very loosely based on a web-novel.  Notes from the YT Link mentioned above leads me down this path.  Below is a translation.

**Title:  An Embrace with Nowhere to Escape***\
Synopsis:  *From an elaborate deception to nowhere to escape! The possessive CEO built for me ​​the ultimate inescapable prison.*

**A Perfect Trap**\
*Lin Yan adjusted her smile to a 17-degree angle under the gallery lights, applying paint to the signature of a Van Gogh imitation—the very painter Song Yizhou's first love admired most. As he approached with a look of amazement, the microchip implanted in the back of her neck transmitted the frequency of his pupil tremors back to her employer's computer.*

**The Spiderweb Takes Shape**\
• *She recited the opening lines of his elementary school essay:*
""I want to raise a butterfly that can't fly.""*\
• *In the coffee she made for him late at night, his mother's secret cinnamon recipe was stirred.*\
• *Until the night the annulment of their arranged marriage was published in the newspaper, the plane ticket in the lining of her suitcase gleamed eerily.*

Song Yizhou suddenly crushed a wine glass:\
*""The person who taught you all this never mentioned I was a psychological profiler?""*

**A Golden Cage**\
• *He exposed her forged identity document, but locked the real one in a safe: ""Now you can only be my Lin Yan.""*\
• *Her rose-covered window frame was welded shut, but fruit candies from her childhood orphanage always appeared by her bedside.*\
• *On her seventh failed escape attempt, he tied a silver chain around her ankle:\
*""Every alarm in this house will play your favorite 'Swan Lake'.""*

**Debunking the Illusion**\
*While she was starving herself into a coma, Song Yizhou actually opened the door himself:*\
*""Come on! Go find your non-existent university professor brother!""*

*As she trembled as she stepped across the threshold, a woman who looked nine-tenths like her suddenly emerged from the clinic on the street corner, holding a missing person poster, choking back tears:*\
*""Little sister, Mom has finally cracked the Song family's genetic maze.""*

You will be comforted to know that this will probably be the first and only deep-dive attached to a drama that I translate.  Since this was my first to be launched into the wild, I wanted it to go in style [with post, post edits for typos of course ... because that's just the way I OCD!] 💕🫰🏻

I have like 4 main friends and then the rest of the group I don't see as often. One of the girls (not from the main friends) is so cute and im getting along very well with her. At one party we talked a bit more than usual and in the end she hugged me and I thougt that was different to the usual friendship hug.
Two weeks later we celebrated new years eve together, and I talked to one of her friends, and aparantly she said to her that there are flirty vibes between us. After hearing that I danced with her talked with her and in the end I brought her to the bus and while we waited she laid her head on my shoulder. (I didn't make a move that night because I was wasted!) 
So again two weeks later we went to a bar again with a few friends but the dynamic was different. We didn't talk a lot and there were no vibes. Still I asked her out on a coffee and she said yes and went home. Later that evening I got a message that she would love to get a coffee with me but that would only be on a friendship basis.
And if I wanted we could talk about it... I said that's OK we're still gonna grab a coffee. Two days later we got the coffee and sat in the Cafe for like 3 hours, but we didn't talk about the friendship thing.
Then we took a walk through the city. And when we said goodbye there was this hug again. Her arms around my neck (even though she's way smaller that I am) my arms around her waist. 
And now in freaking confused. Because she was so cute on new years then she tells me only friendship and then she is cute again?

If anybody can tell me how I should behave now that would be great. Im taking two weeks vacation now and she told me to send her pictures.

Tonight, I wanted to see this space breathe in silence.

This lighting pass was all about shifting the mood from daylight clarity to something more ceremonial — a place that feels less like an office and more like the heart of the Garden itself. The Aetherlight Columns now guide the eye through the space, the steps glow softly beneath the platform, and the central seat stands as a quiet symbol of leadership, memory, and responsibility.

What I love most about working on this scene is how small changes in light completely rewrite the story of the environment. The same geometry, the same structure — but a completely different emotion.

This is part of my ongoing fan-made environment art project, reimagining **Final Fantasy VIII’s Balamb Garden** with modern rendering, real-world materials, and a strong focus on atmosphere and scale.

More refinements ahead. The Garden still has a lot to say.

1qhg8th,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qhg8th/i_feel_like_im_constantly_overstimulated_and/,I feel like im constantly overstimulated and irritable 😭,"Sounds and touch are the biggest things that overstimulate me. Im a single mom to a 5 year old and she is constantly talking and touching me 😅 I get easily overstimulated by noise. my phone is always on silent. Even when I watch videos I keep the volume very low and use subtitles. I have new upstairs neighbors who constantly have their tv/music so loud that I can hear it over my tv and fan. Some nights their TV is literally on all night snd can be clearly heard from my bed even though I sleep with a fan on. Theyre constantly banging and stomping and I feel like im constantly in fight or flight mode. 

  I obviously absolutely love my daughter but she will ask me the same thing 20 times. She also is very touchy and will hug me every 2 minutes climb on me, rub me, etc. I dont mind a hug now and then but she very literally will hug every 5 minutes and put her arm around me, pull my neck to kiss my face, etc. ive explained to her that I know that she loves hugs but mama actually doesnt really like hugs but I do like hugs from her, I just dont like to hug as often as she does. I dont want to hurt her feelings but I know I get irritable and will just get snappy. She doesnt like to play on her own so she constantly wants to be attached to me. if we're sitting watching tv, she's moving all over the place and ends up sitting up against me, kicking me, rubbing against me, etc. I ask her to move over and she'll move over and then be right back in 2 minutes. When we sit at the dinner table where we eat, color, play games, etc, she cant sit still and will repeatedly kick and knee me under the table.  

I also get overstimulated from my bf. He also has adhd but I feel like we have opposite adhd ""types"" where he is always moving and I more like to sit in one spot and hyper focus on something. He likes the TV turned way up and watches videos with the volume all the way up. Last night we were both laying in bed on our phones. I had my phone on silent playing a game and he was watching videos with the volume jacked up. Watching videos of like bodycam footage, people fighting, etc so I was just listening to screaming and yelling from his phone and again, felt like I was in fight or flight mode. He also always eats with his mouth open and I dont even understand how he makes so much noise when he eatsð. He drinks hot coffee and eats ramen soup often and both things he makes the loudest slurping noises the entire time. He also plays video games in the living room. My aparement is open floor plan so the living room, dining area, and kitchen are all basically one big room so whether im cleaning, cooking, or whatever im doing Im hearing screaming and gun shots from his zombie killing game. Ive explained to him that I get overstimualted from sound. He tries to be mindful but I also just think he doesnt understand it and doesnt even realize some of the stuff hes doing. I try to nicely say stuff or make little ""jokes"" to not be a bitch about it but it never really works 😅 I dont want to be a bitch and ask people to change all of these things but then im also snappy when Im overstimulated. Looking for any ideas/suggestions on ways to help myself when overstimulated and how to properly ask the people around me to make things less overstimulating for me without negatively impacting them and their life/experience. I also know that im easily overstimulated so I can never tell if what im wanting from someone else is reasonable or not. 

TLDR: easily over stimulated by sounds and touch. Have a 5 year old that loves hugs/touching and doesnt like to play alone. BF likes to have things on high volume and upstairs neighbors who are incredibly loud.  Im looking for advice on how to cope with nearly constant overstimulation and ways to ask those in my life to adjust things to help me not get so overstimulated, without negatively impacting them and their experience.

1qhg7xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMGstock/comments/1qhg7xp/ke_report_key_take_aways/,KE Report - Key Take Aways,"**Short Version**:   
Things are progressing relatively smoothly. 

Current valuation suggests $5-5.00C is reasonable. 

While there a number of updates I was hoping to see in this month's KE Report there are some beneficial news that should have a positive impact on the stock price

* **Revenue Pivot:** 
   * EPA is opening the doors to profits over the next two quarters.
   * Shipping pallets to start as soon as final EPA approval received
* **Market Fit:** 
   * G+AI is a better/cheaper version of LTO (Industrial batteries). 
   * Commercial testing proceeding with Tier 1 clients 
   * Revenue pivot likely mid-late 2027. 
* **Scale:** 
   * June 2026 Gen 2.0 plant coming on-stream
   * 20x production increase from Gen 1.0 
   * will reduce cost of inputs across all product segments.

**Long Version:** 

**Revenue Pivot**

GMG is waiting on the fully signed consent notice from the EPA this quarter. The first commercial shipment of THERMAL-XR ENHANCE (pallet loads) will be sent to Nu-Calgon and is ready to go to upwards of 2000 locations across North America. 

Notwithstanding, 2026 will be about activation and training not sales. The bottleneck isn't production; it's distribution training. Nu-Calgon has a massive network, but their sales reps and customers (HVAC technicians) need to be trained on the new ""spray kit"" and application process.

Revenue will take time to filter through a multi-tier distribution network. As a result, the next 12 months will see a meaningful move from stocking shelves to recurring re-orders.

**Market Fit for Batteries**

GMG is targeting the US$5.6B Lithium Titanate Battery (LTO) market because it is a high-margin sector where customers are already willing to pay a massive premium for specific performance traits that GMG can replicate—or beat—at a lower cost.

LTO batteries are the most expensive lithium-ion variety, often costing US$1,000–$1,500/kWh. GMG’s G+AI battery uses abundant aluminum and methane-derived graphene, aiming to hit a price point closer to standard Lithium-Ion (\~$150/kWh) while delivering LTO performance.

For example, In mining, they don't need a car to drive 500km; they need a massive haul truck that can charge in 6 minutes while the driver takes a coffee break and then work for 10 years without the battery wearing out. 

LTO used to be the only option for this; GMG G+AI  is new disruptive technology which will outperform at a far lower price point than LTO which gives GMG a significant competitive advantage.

In this case, the disruptive technology isn't just about charging faster; it's about removing the geopolitical and cost barriers of the supply chain. By removing lithium, copper, and cobalt, GMG breaks the barrier of resource scarcity. 

The bottleneck however is that because the technology is disruptive the product needs to overcome incumbent inertia which is why BIC certification is so important.  

Fortunately, Nicol confirmed that GMG is officially targeting early 2026 (effectively ""now"") for sending out the first batch of 1000 mAh+ multi-layer pouch cells to Tier-1 partners. These clients are testing for cycle life and safety in harsh environments. 

For clients currently using LTO batteries (which are heavy and expensive), GMG's specs are already competitive. Nicol mentioned that for industrial robotics, the speed of the 6-minute charge is more important to the client than the total energy density.

**Scaling Graphene Production**

GMG's Gen 2.0 plant is designed to produce 20x more graphene per unit than the Gen 1.0 set-up. The scale up is not just about volume but lowering unit costs to make GMG graphene more competitive in massive industrial markets. 

Nicol noted that GMG's proprietary ""plasma"" process is their primary competitive moat, as it allows them to scale volume and quantity without the supply chain dependencies such as mining. Target is June 2026 for the Gen 2.0 plant to be online. 

**Recent Valuation Changes**

Alpha Spread and Simply Wall St are both suggesting a valuation between $5.00C and $5.60C which is 75% upside from today's current price around $3.20 (US markets were closed today but TSX is open). This likely explains why the tear the last couple of weeks after the EPA announcement. 

The information I have here suggests that the $3.2-3.5C price likely includes the EPA revenue projections but not the Gen 2.0 facilities. A run up to $5-5.6C would likely include the realization of the Gen 2.0 plant coming on stream without significant delays. 

That leaves the battery opportunity hanging in the wind somewhat. But as the BIC testing proceeds through client testing phases (Battery Technology Readiness Levels 7 & 8), GMG should be well positioned to start commercial launch in 2027 depending on how well the testing this year goes. 

**Caveats**

It should be noted Nicol choose his words carefully (good on you mate) however the revenue upside needs to be tempered a bit. 

$28B (and growing rapidly) is the total addressable market that GMG is selling into.

Right now their focus is on capturing 0.1% of that addressable market ($28M). They hope to be able to quickly leverage that into 1% over the next 1-3 years ($280M).

And since the addressable market is many many times that, there is a 'potential' for it to go higher - a lot higher. 

**However**, there are also too many variables in order to make that claim to be going after $2.8B (10%) or $280M (1%) or $140M (0.5%) in a public form when your company is only showing less than $1M on the books.

So while people may want to salivate over that $28B+, we can own the market, payday, they also need to keep their expectations in check. 

Focus on getting to 0.1% first and then we can have the conversation on what comes next. No point in putting the cart before the kangaroo.",8,1768855617.0,GMGstock,1,0.91,False

I’m planning to move to downtown Raleigh soon and would love some advice from people who’ve lived there recently. I’m a young professional and really value walkability, being close to grocery stores, and having restaurants/coffee shops nearby.

My ideal setup is a studio or 1BR in the $1,200–$1,300/month range. I’m hoping to be within a 15–20 minute walk to Nash Square, with at least one grocery store within walking distance as well.

So far, my shortlist includes:

	•	MAA Hue

	•	The Shelton

	•	Cameron Court

	•	SkyHouse

I’ve heard mixed things about management turnover and in larger complexes and security given then downtown areas, so I’d really appreciate recent experiences, especially around management responsiveness and cleanliness (bugs, upkeep, common areas). Noise isn’t a big concern for me, but good maintenance, a well-kept building and security definitely are.

So me and my best friend are making each other scrap books this year to celebrate graduation filled with stuff from through out the years, including quotes each of us have said and what not. 

I wanted to add a special page themed around “things or characters that remind me of you” so we decided to ask others from many different fanbases from several series to get like an unbiased outsider option in the character selection, and we really wanted to include Fe3h!

Anyways, I’m going to describe person A and person B and you can tell me which character matches up with them the best in your opinion! (They can be of any gender) If you have further questions or want more info before you offer a character selection, feel free to ask! Thank you so much! :)

**Person A**

Definitely has like a “fuck you” mentality 

Really tough on the outside, but soft on the inside. cares abt their friends but it’s a tough love kind of way

REALLY STRONG 

Once beat up somebody with a tissue box in a fight (it was to protect person B and now it’s an inside joke)

If they don’t like you, it’s either they get a bad vibe, or you really do deserve it.

Is soft for literally one person (their significant other) even tough with friends 

Spontaneous planner

Brutally honest, doesn’t matter if you’re a teacher or a student. they don’t sugar coat anything

Very opinionated, not afraid to hold anything back 

Kind of anti-social/bad with social cues

Talented

Needs therapy, gets therapy

Cares a lot about there friends, spoils their significant other rotten and cares a lot about their well being, is a whole other person around them 

Loyal

Has known person B since they were 8

Coffee addict

Night owl

**Person B**

Very ambitious and opinionated, but in a more organized way then person A

Confident 

Has strong opinions on morals, wants to leave an impact 

Was voted most likely to be famous by their grade for Senior Superlative in the year book

Everyone knows them, but they don’t hang out with the popular kids

Plans everything ahead of time

Many people who don’t know them well find them intimidating, but they’re very sweet. 

Very loyal to their friends, likes to help everyone with their problems

Likes to challenge the way people think, or tries to get people to see things on a deeper level

Probably needs therapy, doesn’t get therapy

Hard worker, does a million extra curriculars on top of advanced classes, barley sleeps

Has a few close friends but keeps them for life

Often found with Person A everywhere they go

Also coffee addict but its like 20% actual coffee and 80% milk and sugar.

Night owl and early bird

I rent one of the rooms and a garage spot to my younger sister (29F), and her boyfriend comes over every other weekend and stays a night or two.

This has been going on for about 10 months now. Truth be told, it has bothered me at times since her boyfriend's only contribution to the house was a new vacuum. I thought that was very nice, but I feel like it isn't a ""free pass"" to stay over every other week.

One time during these ten months, her boyfriend thought he could store his bike in my garage (without asking me). I tripped over it while working on my car, and it just bothered me that he was getting so comfortable.

Recently, I've been seeing a girl (now my girlfriend), and she stays over almost every weekend. Because of this, there were weekends where we'd have four adults in our house, and it just felt so crammed! My sister told me that she doesn't complain when my girlfriend is over every weekend, to which I responded that this is the house I purchased, so too bad.

I told my sister that I didn't like that her boyfriend comes over and watches my TV and uses my couch. I understand that he has no job currently and is in school, but I feel like he shouldn't be using another man's stuff just to hang out with his girlfriend (my sister). I asked her if they could contribute by buying a coffee table or dining table since the condo is still somewhat unfurnished; I felt that if they wanted to use the space, maybe they could contribute to it. She said that because she's not taking the furniture with her when she leaves, she felt she shouldn't buy any of the living/dining room furniture. Whenever they go out, they always take my sister's car, but at least he drives.

I told her that I feel like, as a man, her boyfriend shouldn't be doing that (coming over to another man's house and using his things to hang out with his girlfriend). I don't want a bad relationship with my sister, and I know that I have conservative values, but this is just how I feel. I want the best for my sister, and I know I have the classic ""he's not good enough for my sister"" mentality. When I see them hanging out together, my sister seems so happy with him, so it pains me to tell her how I feel about him.

Maybe my sister and I are just outgrowing each other at these ages. I know Southern California living is expensive, and I wanted to help my sister save up for a house by charging her ""cheap-ish"" rent so that she could save up to buy a home near me. She has contemplated leaving the state for cheaper housing, and the thought of her moving so far away scares me. I don't really have many family members left, and I'd prefer to stay close.

—February 3 2073–

 

The White House.

 

A name long forgotten.

 

What was once the seat of power of the old United States of America sits in either ruins or completely destroyed along with Earth.

 

But if you hear that name today.

 

They are most likely referring to the building in New Washington.

 

The residence and office of the President of the United Galactic States.

 

Its vast halls holds a series of item collections from both modern and “ancient” eras, portraits of recent and old presidents hang in the walls, a butler makes his way to the most infamous room in that building.

 

The Oval Office, the place where the President works.

 

He knocks before coming in.

 

”Mr President, your Heliplane is here”.

 

Sitting at the table was none other than recently elected and even more recently sworn in President Ronald G Drump, the 190th President of the Galactic States.

 

”Thanks Jerry, im coming”.

 

In what could be described as a rough start for his presidency, Ronald had to deal with this “conference” and he hated it, his voters hated it, the New Republicans are a conservative and mostly anti-drone faction, so having a anti-drone republican in office while having a meeting with drones will not sound good to his future re-election campaign, not to mention the stakes in this meeting, the little remaining stability of the United Nations depends on the result of this summit, which is why he shot down an offer to not attend this meeting as a protest.

 

Making his way to the Heliplane landing spot he couldn’t quite shake off this feeling of imminent dread, climbing into the vehicle, he signaled for the pilot to fly, he watched as the capital of the Galactic States slowly disappears as they enter into hyperspace speed.

 

The United Galactic States was one of if not the most powerful autonomous republic within the UN, unlike other factions, they didnt rely in militias, but rather had a professional standing army (though independent in practice from the UN Army), founded shortly after the Great Death 2076 (300th anniversary of the US) the Galactic States was a vision made by those reminiscent of the old American Dream.

 

On practice however, the GS was just a little less unstable than the UN, having its own ideological factions, it was an event of chance of having this conference take place right after a Pro-Drone Democrat left office.

 

As they exited hyperspace, Ronald couldn’t be more fascinated by the beauty of Aerthis, he heard from the 5 Month Plan but seeing it in person was totally different.

 

As they landed in the Heliplane spot and Ronald exited the vehicle with an umbrella (due to the planet’s heavy rain) he saw the man himself, Zhou Xenlai.

 

”Mr Secretary! What a surprise to see you here”.

 

”Equally, Mr President”.

 

”Well not to be too cocky, but normally there’s a crowd of people and reporters waiting for me wherever i go”.

 

”We purposely chose a more private landing spot, the people are waiting down there”.

 

Both men looked down from the elevated landing spot into the main entrance, it had a clear pathway into the main landing spot, with red carpets, fences and security guards everywhere, reporters and crowds waited in their designated area, waiting for the “main attraction” of the night.

 

”The Drone Delegation” Ronald frowned.

 

”Indeed, lets just hope everything goes according to plan”.

 

”Who do u think they will send? A whole mission? A single guy? Perhaps their leader? Or maybe just a suicide bomber waiting to screw us up…”

 

”Suicide bombers are highly illegal in Inter-Galactic law”.

 

”Those drones dont follow human laws Mr Secretary…”.

 

”…And quite frankly neither do some of us…”.

 

…

 

”Anyway we should head inside before one of us catches something, right Mr President?”.

 

”Sure thing”.

 

The two men entered the vast metal halls of the building, accompanied not too far behind by their respective bodyguards.

 

”So…forgive me for my lack of formality Mr Zhou but what exactly is your plan?”.

 

”Hopefully get in good terms with them, after all the last thing we need right now is a war”.

 

”And how exactly will you achieve that?”.

 

”Honestly…im not quite sure, we’ll just acknowledge eachother’s existence, hopefully a non-aggression or a friendship treaty, and maybe cede to some of their demands”.

 

”And they will listen to some of our own demands, right?”.

 

”Yes, hence why i choose to invite the other factions, so each one of us can have a voice and a say on this…heh…maybe we could also sort out some of our own differences here”.

 

”You are way too utopic Mr Zhou, but i respect your efforts”.

 

The two men stopped just outside of a door.

 

”Well i supposed im yet to thank you for even showing up Mr Ronald”.

 

Ronald laughed a little and the two men parted their ways as Ronald entered the waiting room.

 

The room itself felt like a “who’s who” game.

 

Pope Benedict XXIV: Head of the Unified Christian Church and Co-Head of State of the Holy State of Abraham. He was praying on the left side of the table.

 

Caliph Muhmmad Al-Jazzir: Head of the Muslim Communities and Co-Head of State with Benedict. He was quietly sipping coffee next to the latter.

 

Johan Nestlin: First Secretary of the Galactic Communist Party operating inside the Socialist League. He was scrolling through his phone.

 

Derrick Charles Jenson: CEO of JcJenson and 44th Great Grandchild of Joseph Charles Jenson. He was frantically pacing around the room.

 

And finally last but not least.

 

Dmitry Kraznov: Leader of the Human Salvation League, staring out the window to the skyline of Aerthis.

 

Ronald quietly took his seat next to Johan.

 

”Johan! Its rare to see you in public, where’s Valiryn? Isn’t he the one that does these public appearances?”.

Johan put down his phone.

 

”Tovarishch Baslin is busy”.

 

”Ok Mr Grumpy…what about you Kraznov? Staring ominously through the window wont change much”.

 

Dmitry kept staring into the streets below, HSL supporters gathered in protest of the summit.

 

”Zhou has no idea what he brought here, if he keeps doing bullshit like these he’s gonna lead us into a second great death”.

 

Ronald walked up to Dmitry.

 

”Wouldnt you agree Ronald?”.

 

Ronald knew Dmitry was right, at least partially, they both hated the drones sure, but the two had completely different views on the solution, and launching humanity into a suicidal war for the sake of revenge was certainly not it for Ronald.

 

”Listen, Dmitry old buddy old pal, besides the ethical problems of genocide against the drones…are you sure we are prepared? I mean…its not like the drones will just sit out and wait till they die”.

 

Dmitry genuinely looked confused “Elaborate”.

 

”What if the drones fight back, what if they fight back enough to make us lose”.

 

Dmitry laughed “Dont worry Ronald, us in the League will make sure that never happens…and even if it does…we’ve got that figured out…”.

 

”…what about that ethical part?”.

 

Dmitry stared Ronald dead in the eye “Do you think the drones asked us this same question a thousand years ago”.

 

Ronald couldn’t answer that.

 

”The Solver didnt see civilian or non-combatants, only enemies”.

 

The vehicle transporting the drone delegation flew by and landed as he spoke.

 

“And neither will I”.

The Heliplane slowly landed on the landing spot, the place was surrounded with reporters recording the occasion along with some protesters. The doors of the vehicle opened and 3 metallic and surprisingly small figures appeared, the first to leave appeared to be the leader of the delegation and according to some sources the Council President of the Provisional Republic of Copper 9, Khan Doorman.

 

He got out of the vehicle alongside 2 other drones, presumed to be either security or other diplomats, Zhou was waiting in the main entrance just up ahead and signaled his team to offer them umbrellas for the drones due to their water sensitivity, to which the drones accepted.

 

”So you must be General Secretary Zhou Xenlai, its a pleasure”. The small drone reaches out his hand to the significally taller human.

 

Their difference of about 15 centimeters made the handshake awkward as hell but Zhou managed the situation good enough to pass a respect vibe.

 

”My pleasure aswell Mr Doorman, shall we go inside, we have a lot to discuss”.

 

Khan agreed and the two entered the building.",2,1768854958.0,MurderDronesOfficial,0,0.67,False

1qhfvlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/branding/comments/1qhfvlf/is_this_a_viable_offline_marketing_channel_for/,Is this a viable offline marketing channel for larger brands?,"Hey everyone - I’m doing some early-stage market research on a new offline advertising concept and I’d love honest, critical feedback from people who work in marketing, brand, growth, or media buying.

**The idea:**

Instead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  
A company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand.

So if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.

The thinking is that this channel is:  
• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  
• Hyper-targeted by location  
• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  
• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive – coffee)

**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** – just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  
A) A serious marketing channel  
B) A gimmick  
C) Something brands would only test at a small scale

My questions:

👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  
• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  
• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  
• How would you measure success?  
• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?

👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  
• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters – or not really?  
• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?

I’m especially interested in hearing from:  
• Media buyers  
• Brand managers  
• Growth marketers  
• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns

Brutal honesty is welcome. If it’s bad, tell me why. If it’s interesting, tell me what would need to be true for it to actually work.

Today I matched with a younger guy who, as it quickly became apparent, wanted a FWB situation. But he wanted me to come to his house tonight for sex.

I explained that it's been a while for me and while the idea is appealing, I wanted to meet in public first. I also confirmed he's single and laid some ground rules regarding safe sex and personal safety. He agreed, said he's available after 8, and suggested coffee. I said I'm tired of coffee dates (truth) and I don't drink coffee in the evening. I suggested drinks. He turned that down saying he doesn’t like bars. I suggested a burger place. He didn't like that either.

So I suggested meeting another day when we could have dinner and conversation first (since he won't meet for drinks). His only other availability was another 8 pm. He offered meeting at Denny's. I said at this stage of my life I'm a cut above Dennys. He said he just meant to meet there, not eat.

I explained carefully that I still want some friendship to the FWB and am not going to an Internet stranger's house right away. But every suggestion I made was turned into just me going to his house. So I gave up and blocked him because he clearly wasn't listening. He said he likes older women so hopefully this will be a lesson that older women have already made our dumb mistakes with hirny guys.

I thought FWB involved doing things in addition to sex, not just serial hookups. Am I wrong about that?",15,1768854841.0,datingoverfifty,97,1.0,False

Ronald knew Dmitry was right, at least partially, they both hated the drones sure, but the two had completely different views on the solution, and launching humanity into a suicidal war for the sake of revenge was certainly not it for Ronald.

 

”Listen, Dmitry old buddy old pal, besides the ethical problems of genocide against the drones…are you sure we are prepared? I mean…its not like the drones will just sit out and wait till they die”.

 

Dmitry genuinely looked confused “Elaborate”.

 

”What if the drones fight back, what if they fight back enough to make us lose”.

 

Dmitry laughed “Dont worry Ronald, us in the League will make sure that never happens…and even if it does…we’ve got that figured out…”.

 

”…what about that ethical part?”.

 

Dmitry stared Ronald dead in the eye “Do you think the drones asked us this same question a thousand years ago”.

 

Ronald couldn’t answer that.

 

”The Solver didnt see civilian or non-combatants, only enemies”.

 

The vehicle transporting the drone delegation flew by and landed as he spoke.

 

“And neither will I”.

The Heliplane slowly landed on the landing spot, the place was surrounded with reporters recording the occasion along with some protesters. The doors of the vehicle opened and 3 metallic and surprisingly small figures appeared, the first to leave appeared to be the leader of the delegation and according to some sources the Council President of the Provisional Republic of Copper 9, Khan Doorman.

 

He got out of the vehicle alongside 2 other drones, presumed to be either security or other diplomats, Zhou was waiting in the main entrance just up ahead and signaled his team to offer them umbrellas for the drones due to their water sensitivity, to which the drones accepted.

 

”So you must be General Secretary Zhou Xenlai, its a pleasure”. The small drone reaches out his hand to the significally taller human.

 

Their difference of about 15 centimeters made the handshake awkward as hell but Zhou managed the situation good enough to pass a respect vibe.

 

”My pleasure aswell Mr Doorman, shall we go inside, we have a lot to discuss”.

 

Khan agreed and the two entered the building.",2,1768854815.0,MurderDrones,0,0.75,False

Hi everyone. I developed an app that was intitally made so you can search cafes that serve specialty coffee in your area by location, across the US. It is free. There are a ton of other things on their now too that are tiered, but if you sign up you get a 3 weeks free to try all features. It is only a couple dollars/month after that if you want to keep the xtras. Or for free it still locates cafes near you. I am open to giving some people more time as beta testers. Please try out the app. You can build a profile, chat with other members, track cafes visited, rate and review cafes and upload photos, and sooooo much more.

Visited both LV stores during my trip to Barcelona last Friday. Met a really nice CA who told me how generous Spain’s VAT refund is compared to other countries. 

Ended up getting a Neverfull for my mom, her first LV and the toiletry bag, travel sprays and the Virgil Abloh coffee table book for myself (I don’t know what possessed me to get the coffee table book because I then had to carry it around until my flight home 5 hours later 😭)

He did show me a table Global Blue uses to determine the tax refund for Spain based on how much is spent. I’ve included some figured below. Great to use as a reference point to plan purchases for anyone coming to Spain. 

Pro tip: 
download the Global Blue app and set it up with your details. Before I even left the checkout area I had a notification telling me what my estimated refund was and I could see the detail within the app. 

€1.000,01 - €1.500,00 ~ 13,70 %
€1.500,01 - €2.000,00 ~ 14,05 %
€2.000,01 - €3.000,00 ~ 14,50 %
€3.000,01 - €4.000,00 ~ 14,90 %
€4.000,01 - €5.000,00 ~ 15,30 %
> €5.000,00 ~ 15,70 %

For anything €1000 or less the refund amount was an amount rather than a specific percentage e.g

€900,01 - €925,00 ~ €119,50
€925,01 - €950,00 ~ €122,00
€950,01 - €975,00 ~ €126,00

It tends to happen gradually. At first you find yourself not needing coffee but you drink it out of habit. Then you start talking to everyone like they’re your best friend, strangers are lightbulbs and you’re just an insect. Your normal distinction between night and day loses meaning, and a passing glance starts to look like everyone wants to go to bed. Everything begins to fall to the wayside, everything becomes peripheral if it isn’t *go, move, act*. Do that, and do it without thinking, say it, drink it and take it without consideration. There’s no stopping, there can be no stopping. The word ‘stop’ doesn’t exist.

You inch upwards and upwards until the reins slip off—the finish line is really just the starting point. You have to find people on your wavelength, on your level, but you can’t find them. You want to keep going and going although everyone else wants to sleep, to stop, for you to stop. You feel like a pest. You’ve become what you fear and love most: mania.

The envelope has been pushed, someone you love has a paper cut. But you won’t care until you’ve crossed the finish line and landed headfirst in a patch of dirt. Only then will you shudder like your body is rejecting your brain. But until that point you just go to the next thing. You’re bored already, chasing endorphins like you’re collecting each rush of excitement, each stare, each and every thing that will get you higher and higher until you go SPLAT.

You feel naked, exposed. As though your subconscious has been laid out for the world to pick apart and interpret and walk away with that as their memory of you. What is really just a part of you becomes all of who you are, only some can spot the difference. You have a timeline but can only remember fragments. You feel scared of who you are and who you could be. For now, you just go SPLAT.

1qhffch,https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/1qhffch/the_anglen_langauge_a_sister_of_scots_and_english/,"the Anglen langauge, a sister of Scots and English","**About it:**

Anglen is a language descended from late Middle English with influences from Scots and Irish English. It has remained more conservative than standard English in some aspects and really innovative in other ways.

Here are all the differences between standard English and Anglen in phonology, grammar and vocabulary, and at the end a summary of the orthography.

**Phonology:**

Consonants

\-/ʍ/ and /w/ remain separate, but /ʍ/ is realized as \[ɸ\]

when \[ɸɛn\], which \[ɸɪt͡ʃ\], what \[ɸɔt\]

\-old english’ /ç/ (\[ç\] after front vowels and \[x\] after back vowels) is preserved and the vowel changes that were caused because of its loss are not present here

night \[nɪçt\], thought \[hɔxt\], rough \[rʊx\]

this prevents lite and light from merging

the sequence /çs/ is pronounced as \[ks\]

laughs \[laks\], thighs \[hɪks\], coughs \[kɔks\]

this merges laughs-lacks and coughs-cocks

\-/r/ is realized as \[r\] word initially and \[ɾ\] in clusters and everywhere else

rich \[rɪt͡ʃ\], rest \[rɛst\], rain \[reːn\]

mirror \[mɪɾəɾ̥\], dream \[dɾiːm\], nearby \[njəɾbiː\]

when in cluster with a voiceless consonant or at word end, it’s pronounced as \[ɾ̥\]

tree \[tɾ̥iː\], father \[fɔdəɾ̥\], work \[wɛɾ̥k\]

\-full rhoticity, that is, all historic rs are pronounced

part \[pɔɾ̥t\], more \[moɾ̥\], smirk \[smɛɾ̥k\]

\-/ð/ becomes \[d\]

this \[dɪs\], feather \[fɛdəɾ̥\], breathe \[bɾiːd\]

this causes breed-breathe, dare-there and then-den to merge

\-/θ/ becomes \[h\] word initially and \[f\] at word end

think \[hɪŋk\], thing \[hɪŋg\], thirst \[hɛɾ̥st\]

with \[wɪf/wɪv\], bath \[baf\], tooth \[toːf\]

this merges thigh-high and thorn-horn

before /r/ and mid-word it’s still pronounced as \[θ\]

through \[θɾ̥ʊx\], three \[θɾ̥iː\], throw \[θɾ̥ɔw\]

nothing \[nʊθɪŋg\] brothel \[bɾɔθəl\], author \[ɔθəɾ̥\]

\-the cluster /wr/ is preserved but pronounced as \[vɾ\]

write \[vɾiːt\], wrong \[vɾɔŋg\], wrath \[vɾɔf\]

\-preservation of the kn- and gn- clusters

knee \[kniː\], knot \[knɔt\], knife \[kniːf\]

gnat \[gnat\], gnarl \[gnɔɾl\], gnome \[gnɔwm\]

this prevents knight and night from merging

\-preservation of the sequence <mb>

thumb \[hʊmb\], lamb \[lamb\], dumb \[dʊmb\]

the final -b prevents hum and thumb from merging

\-historically deleted l and t are preserved

walk \[wɔlk\], folk \[fɔlk\], should \[ʃʊld\]

often \[ɔftən\], listen \[lɪstən\], soften \[sɔftən\]

this prevents would and wood from merging

\-/d͡ʒ/ is devoiced at word end

change \[t͡ʃeːn̥t͡ʃ\], wage \[weːt͡ʃ\], page \[peːt͡ʃ\]

this merges liege-leech

\-/n/ is also devoiced like /r/ but only before a voiceless consonant, it’s still voiced at word end

meant \[mɛn̥t\], went \[wɛn̥t\], since \[sɪn̥s\]

\-metathesis of the endings -sp and -sk to ps and ks

grasp > graps, wasp > waps, crisp > crips

ask > aks, task > taks, mask > maks

this merges gasp-gaps and ask-axe

a schwa is inserted between s for the plurals and conjugations

asks > \[aksəs\], wasps > \[wɔpsəs\]

\-the sequence <ng> doesn’t lose the \[g\], so it’s pronounced as \[ŋg\]

sing \[sɪŋg\], wing \[wɪŋg\], bringing \[bɾɪŋgɪŋg\]

\-some words have inserted consonants that weren’t historically there (something mostly random and limited to a few words)

wash \[wɔɾ̥ʃ\], us \[həs/hʊs\], draw \[dɾɔɾ̥\], other \[hʊdəɾ̥\]

\-/t/ is always pronounced as \[t\] instead of a flap, d or glottal stop

\-/k/ and /g/ are palatalized before front vowels as \[c\] and \[ɟ\]

keep \[ciːp\], cat \[cat\], kill \[cɪl\]

game \[ɟeːm\], get \[ɟɛt\], gap \[ɟap\]

\-the voiceless stops are never aspirated

\-the l is never dark but always clear

Vowels

\-the great vowel shift was mostly full except for \[iː\], \[oː\] and \[uː\] (the vowels in die, tooth and mouth), which stayed the same

mouth \[muːf\], house \[huːs\], cow \[kuː\]

die \[diː\], lie \[liː\], wife \[wiːf\]

soon \[soːn\], goose \[goːs\], shoe \[ʃoː\]

this merges life-leaf and time-team

\-lack of the foot-strut split, having foot and cut as rhymes

love \[lʊv\], fun \[fʊn\], up \[ʊp\]

\-/ɔː/, /ɑ/ and /ɒ/ merge into \[ɔ\]

bother \[bɔdəɾ̥\], cloth \[klɔf\], not \[nɔt\]

palm \[pɔlm\], start \[stɔɾ̥t\], aunt \[ɔn̥t\]

\-\[ej\] becomes \[eː\]

face \[feːs\], way \[weː\], came \[ceːm\]

\-middle english’ \[ɔː\] became \[ɔw\] instead of \[ow/əw\]

goat \[gɔwt\], show \[ʃɔw\], wrote \[vɾɔwt\]

\-has the pour-poor and horse-hoarse mergers

\-/ɜ/ becomes \[ɛ\]

bird \[bɛɾd\], sir \[sɛɾ̥\], search \[sɛɾ̥t͡ʃ\]

this merges fair and fur

\-/æ/ is realized as \[a\]

laugh \[laç\], thank \[haŋk\], man \[man\]

\-j is preserved after consonants

tune \[tjuːn\], new \[njuː\], sue \[sjuː\]

\-final word \[i\] is becomes \[ə\]

funny \[fʊnə\], happy \[hapə\], coffee \[kɔfə\]

**Grammar:**

\-the retention of ‘thou’ \[duː\] as the 2^(nd) person singular pronoun, along with its own forms  (thy = possessive, thee = obj. pronoun, wert = past be, art = present be)

I met your mom vs ich met thy mom

you are funny vs thou art funny

why were you naked? vs why wert thee naked?

the forms -est/-eth aren’t used though

\-ye is the 2^(nd) person plural pronoun, like y’all and youse in many dialects, and has the same forms as you, except you is actually the object pronoun and yer is the possessive

y’all are my best friends vs ye’re my best friends

y’all weren’t here vs ye were naw here

this is for y’all vs this is for you

I'm y’all’s new teacher vs ich are yer new teacher

\-there are two classes of nouns, which are reflected in the definite articles, with ‘the’ being used for countable nouns and ‘thon’ for uncountable nouns

the money vs thon money

the water vs thon water

the meat vs thon meat

\-some nouns have different plurals

some using the -en ending:

foxes vs foxen

eyes vs eyen

houses vs housen

girl vs girlen

feather vs feathern

knees vs kneen

others in analogy with foot/feet, tooth/teeth and mouse/mice:

wounds vs wiend \[wiːnd\]

cows vs kie \[ciː\]

sounds vs siend \[siːnd\]

crowds vs cride \[kɾ̥iːd\]

and others through regularization:

sheep vs sheeps

fish vs fishes

\-some verbs also have different forms, though to a lesser extent than nouns

some are archaisms:

worked vs wrought

helped vs holp (simple past) / holpen (past participle)

walked vs walken (past participle)

and others through analogy:

hit (simple past) vs hat (compare with spit/spat and sit/sat)

hit (past participle) vs haten

jumped vs jamp

made vs mook (compare take/took)

\-yon used as a demonstrative for far things, as a three way distinction with this and that

that hill far away vs yon hill far way

\-the 3^(rd) person singular -s is used for the plural too

they sing vs they sings

the dogs bark vs the dogs barks

people want that vs people wants that

\-are replaces am for the 1^(st) person singular

I'm John, and you? vs ich are John, and thou?

I'm not married vs ich are naw married

\-use of ‘naw’ instead of not as the negation particle

didn't vs did naw

can't vs can naw

isn't vs is naw

aren't vs are naw

it can also be applied where english usually wouldn’t use not

not going to vs going naw to

I’m not going to bed yet vs ich are going naw to bed yet

\-adjectives in negative sentences become negative

he didn’t do anything vs he did naw do nothing

I don’t need anybody vs ich do naw need nobody

\-use of ‘done’ before verbs to denote they have already been complete, with the verb being in the gerund form

I washed the dishes already vs ich done washing the dishes

I told you already vs ich done telling thou

that has already been done vs that’s done doing

\-‘an’ is replaced by \[eʔ\]

a eye \[eʔ iː\]

a old \[eʔ ɔwld\]

\-the definite article is also used before kinship terms in place of ‘my’

my brother came to visit vs the brother came to visit

his wife is nicer than my wife vs his wife is nicer than the wife

my mom still cooks for me vs the mom still cooks for me

my uncle’s coming to visit vs the eam’s coming to visit

\-generalized use of the comparative/superlative suffix -er/est for adjectives, whereas standard english would use the “more X than Y/most X” construction in many adjectives

more boring than vs boringer

more beautiful than vs beautifuler

most boring vs boringest

most beautiful vs beautifulest

Vocabulary

\-some words retain older forms

it vs hit \[hɪt\]

I vs ich \[ɪt͡ʃ\]

them vs hem \[hɛm\]

one vs un \[ʊn\]

egg/eggs vs ey/eyre \[aj/ajɾ̥\]

church vs kirk \[cɪɾ̥k\]

\-other inherited words won over what ended up as the standard form

know vs ken \[cɛn\]

insect vs mire (originally just meaning ant) \[miːɾ̥\]

voice vs reard \[rɛɾd\]

penis vs pintle \[pɪn̥təl\]

vagina vs cunt (non-vulgar here, merely meaning vagina) \[kʊn̥t\]

uncle vs eam \[iːm\]

also vs eke \[iːk\]

patient vs thildy \[hɪldə\]

language vs atheed \[əθiːd\]

interest/benefit vs behoof \[bɪhoːf\]

allow vs suffer (with the meaning of allowing or letting)

kiss vs buss (kiss is used as a verb (to kiss), while buss is the noun (a buss)) \[bʊs\]

\-words that fell out of use in most English dialects but survived here

yonder: something at a distant place, used in a three distinction with here and there, similar to spanish’ aquí-ahí-allá

fain: pleased with or by something

tis: contraction of it and is, similar to it’s

shog: to shake something

reek: smoke

\-and words from other languages

plam \[plɔm\]: to flatter or charm some, from Irish

gob \[gɔb\]: an animal’s mouth, with mouth referring specifically to a human’s mouth, from Irish

farmore \[faɾmɔwɾ̥\]: a tall and chunky man, from Irish

sleeveen \[sliːviːn\]: a dishonest or generally inmoral person, from Irish

loch \[lɔx\]: a lake, displaced english’ ‘lake’, from Scottish Gaelic

ingle \[ɪŋɡəl\]: bonfire, from Scottish Gaelic

gammel \[ɟaməl\]: an old woman, with elder being specifically an old man, from Old Norse

bloot \[bloːt\]: a feast or celebration, displaced English’ ‘feast’ (which came from French), from Old Norse

skelf \[scɛlf\]: a splinter, from Dutch

among some others, mainly from Irish

**Orthography:**

The orthography in Anglen is much more consistent than it is in English.

Consonants:

/p/ - p			/t/ - t				/k, c/ - c, k^(1)

/b/ - b			/d/ - d				/g, ɟ/ - g

/ɸ/ - ph			/f/ - f				/θ/ - th

/h/ - h			/x, ç/ - gh			/s/ - s

/v/ - v			/z/ - z, s^(2)				/ʃ/ -sh

/t͡ʃ/ - ch			/d͡ʒ/ - j				/j/ - y

/w/ - w			/r, ɾ, ɾ̥/ - r				/l/ - l

/m/ - m			/n, n̥, ŋ/ - n

Vowels:

/ɪ/ - i			/iː/ - ie				/ɛ/ - e

/eː/ - ee			/a/ - a				/ɔ/ - o

/oː/ - oe			/ʊ/ - u				/uː/ - ue

/ə/ - e

/ɔw/ - ou			/ɔj/ - oy			/juː/ - yue

1. c before the letters a/o/u and k before e
2. /z/ is written as such except in the plurals, where it’s written as s",12,1768853891.0,conlangs,0,1.0,False
1qhfeb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1qhfeb6/28_m4f_uk_europe_looking_for_chats_and_genuine/,28 [M4F] UK/ Europe- Looking for chats and genuine connection!,"Hi, I’m Andrew, I’m a 28 year old guy from the UK (North West). I’d say I’m pretty easy going, curious, and always up for trying new things. I’m looking to meet someone I genuinely click with, if that’s a relationship or we just end up chatting and sending memes or reels to each other!

A bit about me: I volunteer from time to time on a rewilding project in the Lake District which is really cool because I get to talk to people, it’s an excuse to go into the fells and I also get coffee provided as well! This year I'm getting back into scuba diving after doing a dive over Christmas and rediscovering how much I enjoy it.

Appearance wise I'm slim, 176cm blonde hair, blue eyes and a trimmed beard.

I’m currently working in construction and I've applied to do a course in civil engineering because it seems like a good next step. I’d like to do some hikes like the Camino de Santiago, Annapurna Circuit and some of the Dolomites. When I’m not at work, volunteering or procrastinating about other wildly adventurous things I like to relax by reading, watching films or playing on the PlayStation. I like to visit friends all over the country and any excuse to visit a city (Manchester- Chinatown there is amazing).

Random fact about me- I’m from England, lived here all my life and somehow I’ve made it to 28 without drinking a cup of tea!

Ideally I’d love something that grows into a genuine connection, but I’m happy to let things develop naturally, bonus points if you’re up for swapping travel stories, bad film opinions or idk a random fact you like?

If this resonates, tell me your favourite place you’ve ever visited or a wild adventure or trip that you’d like to take one day!",1,1768853827.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
