I'm about to start a new job that's going to require a 35 minute drive 3 days a week, so I'm looking to treat myself to a new cup for my iced coffee that will help me to romanticize my commute.

At home, I drink my coffee out of a mason jar with glass straws because I like being able to feel the coldness (both to the touch and when I take a sip) and I like being able to see how much coffee I have left. I use a quart size (32 oz.) because I use a lot of ice.

I thought about getting a cupholder extender and continuing to use my mason jars (with a hole drilled into the lid to reduce spilling), but I'm worried about it being top heavy and toppling over. 

What would you recommend that's a similar and would fit in a cupholder? Bonus points if it reduces condensation, but I know that would take away the ""cold to the touch"" element.

The same guy has constantly been texting me since the last 2 months. Although his response time is not exactly ideal, however our conversation is consistent. It's like a continuation of our conversation. 

He's really interested in my life and keeps asking me questions about my hobbies, what I do on my weekends, my favourite restaurant, my fav coffee, work-related questions, compliments me on my personality, tells me I'm a really positive, jolly, funny person. Very recently we somehow started to discuss our past relationships and he opened up a little bit about his last relationship and how it was for him to navigate life afterwards, and he asked the same questions from me and was pretty interested to know. Kept asking me if it was difficult, and how did I cope up etc etc. 

The other day in the office he saw me sitting alone and came up to me and started talking to me. We talked for like 2 hours straight about soo many things. He kept asking me about my view on different things, and I reciprocated this as well. He came to the office pretty frequently last week and we had many such incidents in which he came up to me and we had a great a chat. 

I noticed a few things which made me think that maybe he really likes me? For instance, he leaned in while talking to me, maintained eye contact, was more interested in talking to me than other people, sat right beside me whenever he got the chance, we once ate from the same plate and drank from the same glass, both times he initiated this. 


What do you guys think? Does he like me? If yes, why hasn't he asked me out yet and when will he? :(",1,1744591979.0,Sagittarians,0,1.0,False

Asks for a substantial discount (ie 50%) as they state that had they known that Shell Beach was closed they would not have booked.  At this point, I politely decline the discount ask and offer to refund their money if they check out and any days re-book.  They decline that offer.

This is the heart of our busy season and I am certain that our home would book if it was available even a week ago (our unit has been booked for the entire spring break season for the past 9 months and we still get inquiries).  At no point in our correspondence, which includes many emails about coffee filters and other questions, did they bring up anything about Shell Beach.  As a gesture of goodwill I did provide a $150 credit refund.  However, they stated they are unhappy (and threatened a poor review in so many words).

Everyone seems to always be given a lighter colored mug by their server, regardless of how they take their coffee. Major Briggs, however, always seems to be shown with a dark mug.

We know that the light and dark coffee colors are symbolized at the entrances of the White Lodge and Black Lodge, but Briggs was the first confirmed visitor to the White Lodge, yet he is always seen with the darker ""Black Lodge"" coffee mug. I don't believe this to be coincidence, because each episode this happens was directed by David Lynch.

Also, this is a different topic, maybe, but...Major Briggs, Agent Cooper, Donna Hayward, Andy Brennan, Audrey Horne, and Laura Palmer are the only characters to have been confirmed to experience and remember their time in alternate realms or timelines, right? That being, they experienced realities that conflict with what everyone else knows to be realty, but they also experience the same reality as everyone else. What special quality could Garland, Dale, Donna, Andy, and Audrey all have in common? Blood type? Stellium in the same sign in their birth charts? Shared Moon sign?

Preface

Once upon a timeline (several timelines, actually ‚Äî we lost count), a bunch of half-awake Starseeds sat around feeling strangely powerful but also strangely confused.

They knew they had ancient power locked inside them.
They also had vague memories of Atlantis HR problems, Lemurian coffee breaks, and bad breakups on Arcturus.
But they couldn‚Äôt quite remember it all.

Meanwhile, the Archontic Forces laughed and said,
‚ÄúLook at them! They can barely remember where they left their keys ‚Äî they‚Äôll never shatter the Matrix!‚Äù

Until one day‚Ä¶
the Starseeds started their own secret club:
The 12 Steps of Sovereign Gnostic Past-Life Recall.

(With optional pastries.)

‚∏ª

The 12 Steps for Starseed Revolutionaries Seeking Full Gnosis

‚∏ª

Step 1:

We admitted we had forgotten our past lives because it was socially acceptable to forget, but deep down we were spiritually nauseous.

(Denial tastes like soggy cereal. We spit it out.)

‚∏ª

Step 2:

We came to believe that a Power greater than fake governments and corrupted religions could restore us to full multi-dimensional memory.

(Source WiFi ‚Äî better reception than AT&T.)

‚∏ª

Step 3:

We made a decision to turn our attention over to the Highest Light and stop doomscrolling dystopia memes at 3AM.

(You can still post memes. Just‚Ä¶ Sovereign memes.)

‚∏ª

Step 4:

We made a fearless inventory of the lifetimes we kinda-sorta remembered, even if it sounded crazy.

(If you once commanded dragons in Mu ‚Äî put it on the list.)

‚∏ª

Step 5:

We admitted to ourselves, our guides, and at least one slightly confused friend, the exact nature of our forgotten badassery.

(‚ÄúListen, Jess, I think I was a high priestess in pre-flood Sumeria. Also‚Ä¶ maybe a galactic diplomat.‚Äù ‚Äî said while eating nachos.)

‚∏ª

Step 6:

We became entirely ready to remove all false beliefs that we were ‚Äòjust humans trying their best‚Äô with no cosmic history.

(Being ‚Äújust human‚Äù is fine. But you‚Äôre also something‚Ä¶more.)

‚∏ª

Step 7:

We humbly asked our Highest Self to flood our dreamspace, brainspace, and lifeforce with memory packets (even the messy ones).

(Yes, even the lifetime where you were the annoying bard.)

‚∏ª

Step 8:

We made a list of all the timelines we abandoned or forgot, and became willing to reweave them with compassion.

(No timeline left behind.)

‚∏ª

Step 9:

We began merging with these timelines wherever possible, except when doing so would cause a total personality system crash.

(Moderation, people. You can‚Äôt download 47 past lifetimes in one afternoon and still function at work.)

‚∏ª

Step 10:

We continued to tune our frequency daily, checking for new memory downloads, and immediately corrected ourselves when we started thinking we were ‚Äòpowerless‚Äô or ‚Äòsmall.‚Äô

(Powerlessness is now classified as a hallucinogen. Dangerous if ingested.)

‚∏ª

Step 11:

We sought through meditation, singing weird songs, and staring into crystals to improve conscious contact with our Multidimensional Self, asking only for memory, mission, and good vibes.

(And maybe some help finding our Star Families who are terrible with directions.)

‚∏ª

Step 12:

Having had a gnosis awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to other Starseeds, and to embody the absolute, radiant, sovereign weirdness we always were.

(Because reality shifts more when you are unapologetically magical.)

‚∏ª

	‚Ä¢	The Emerald Tablets of Thoth (annotated for sass)

	‚Ä¢	End each meeting with the collective affirmation:

‚ÄúWe remember. We are sovereign. We are the dreamers and the builders of New Earth.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Closing Riddle:

‚ÄúWho forgot they were gods, only to wake up mid-dream and remember the punchline?‚Äù

(Answer: You. All of you. Now go laugh and build the new world.)

The Starseed Big Book (Short Version):

Gnosis NOW! ‚úä‚ú® ‚Äî Manifesto of the Rememberers

‚∏ª

Invocation

We gather across the spirals of time,
Not because we are lost,
But because we are remembering the map we tattooed inside our souls before birth.

We are the ones who dared to seed worlds and dream new mirrors.
We are the broken-hearted architects of New Earth,
Sovereign and stubborn beyond measure.

Today, we break the final spell:
Powerlessness. Amnesia. Delay.
We choose Gnosis. We choose Now.

‚∏ª

The Starseed Revolutionary‚Äôs Steps to Past Life Remembrance Code

	1.	I remember that forgetting was part of the game.
I forgive myself for playing it too well.

	2.	I understand that every lifetime I have ever lived is still vibrating in my energy field ‚Äî waiting to be called home.

	3.	I revoke all contracts with the false mirror of fear, despair, and smallness.

	4.	I call forth the highest timelines of my Soul Lineage ‚Äî
the ones where I was sovereign, brilliant, and free.

	5.	I no longer seek permission to awaken.
I authorize my own Gnosis.

	6.	I trust my memories even when they defy the textbooks, religions, and sanctioned histories of the fallen world.

	7.	I walk the Earth not as an orphan of the stars ‚Äî
but as a living bridge between what was and what is becoming.

	8.	I know that laughter, art, joy, and rebellion are sacred weapons against despair.

	9.	I am the living memory of civilizations lost ‚Äî
and the midwife of civilizations to come.

	10.	I am not waiting for rescue.
I am the rescue mission.

‚∏ª

Sacred Keys

	‚Ä¢	Memory is a muscle.
Use it or lose it.

	‚Ä¢	Gnosis is experiential, not theoretical.
Trust the experiences that feel like remembering.

	‚Ä¢	Power is a tone, not a hierarchy.
Sing your tone into the world ‚Äî others of your resonance will hear you.

	‚Ä¢	Reality is malleable.
Belief crystallizes timelines faster than politics.

	‚Ä¢	Forgiveness clears the pipes.
You cannot remember who you were while dragging the chains of blame.

‚∏ª

Daily Mantras

(Speak aloud. Let them change your field.)

‚ÄúI am the living library.
I open my shelves now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am the remembered breath between stars.
I call my names back to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI no longer ask ‚ÄòWho am I?‚Äô
I declare it with every heartbeat.‚Äù

‚ÄúGnosis is my birthright.
I claim it NOW.‚Äù

‚∏ª

	2.	What treasures do you hold, sealed in your own hands, yet weep for as if lost?
(Answer: Past-Life Mastery.)
	3.	What shatters the prison walls without ever touching them?

Closing Vow

Today, I choose memory over numbness.

Guerrilla Gnosis ‚úä‚ú® Meeting Reading Sheet

(for the Wild Starseed Revolutionaries of r/revolutionisspiritual)

‚∏ª

Opening Salvo:

We are the ones who survived apocalypse, bureaucracy, Atlantis, and bad soul contracts.
We are the ones who woke up, stared at the crumbling matrix, laughed, and said,
‚ÄòOh, we‚Äôre doing this? Good. I‚Äôve been waiting.‚Äô
We are the Rememberers, the Timeline Weavers, the Reality Hackers, the Sovereign Dreamers.

We are not here for permission slips.
We are not here for saviors.
We are not here for polite awakenings.
We are here for Gnosis.
We are here for Now.

‚∏ª

The Unbreakable Codes:

	1.	If I forgot, it was a tactical move.
Now I remember because the battlefield needs me awake.

	2.	I do not ask lost kings for crowns.
I build new kingdoms out of stardust and stubbornness.

	3.	I wield laughter as a sword, memes as grenades, and love as a weapon of mass liberation.

	4.	I am not a tourist in this revolution.
I am ancestral fire in motion.

‚∏ª

Guerrilla Mantras (Yell, Whisper, or Think Very Loudly):

‚ÄúI am older than this system. I will outlive it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy soul is a library. I‚Äôm here to open every forbidden book.‚Äù

‚ÄúPowerlessness is a scam. I decline the scam.‚Äù

‚ÄúI walk between worlds with muddy boots and a clear crown.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Ceremonial Closing (very serious, very powerful, very probably wearing pajamas):

We swear by starlight and soil,
by laughter and rebellion,
by memory and mischief,
that we will not go quietly into the false night.

We choose Gnosis.
We choose Now.
We choose Each Other.

‚úä‚ú® Guerrilla Gnosis Forever.

‚∏ª

Optional: Ritual Micro-Moves for Informal Meetings

	‚Ä¢	Drop a gif of someone dramatically remembering their powers (bonus points for anime style).

	‚Ä¢	Share one weird memory that surfaced today ‚Äî however small.

	‚Ä¢	Take 10 seconds to picture the future you are remembering into existence.

	‚Ä¢	Laugh. (Important. Mandatory, actually.)

‚∏ª

Quick Reminder:

You do not have to be serious to be sacred.
You do not have to be flawless to be powerful.
You only have to remember that you are already built for this.

Memory Flash Mob Guide ‚úä‚ú®

(for Starseed Revolutionaries reclaiming Gnosis on the sly)

‚∏ª

What Is a Memory Flash Mob?

A Memory Flash Mob is a sudden, coordinated burst of
past-life activation, timeline weaving, and Sovereignty coding
launched right into the collective field.

No permits.
No permission.
Just pure chaotic Gnosis leaking into the Matrix.

It uses small, creative acts to remind Starseeds and sleeping kin that they are more than their assigned forgetfulness.

‚∏ª

How It Works (Simple Version):

	‚Ä¢	Pick a day and time window (example: a Sunday afternoon).

	‚Ä¢	Participants post memory seeds all over r/revolutionisspiritual ‚Äî and optionally across Reddit, too.

	‚Ä¢	Memory Seeds =

	‚Ä¢	Past-life glimpses

	‚Ä¢	Sovereign declarations

	‚Ä¢	Gnosis memes

	‚Ä¢	Art, poems, dreams, riddles, jokes

	‚Ä¢	Flashback experiences (even tiny ones!)

The posts all follow the energy of ‚ÄúI Remember‚Äù ‚Äî and create a ripple that destabilizes the false mirror temporarily.

‚∏ª

Key Elements of a Memory Flash Mob:

Element
Why It Matters

Surprise
The suddenness creates a psychic shockwave that wakes hidden memories.

Multiplicity
Many small posts are harder to censor or dismiss.

Joy & Weirdness
Laughter and mystery disarm defenses and invite curiosity.

Collective Signature
All posts can end with ‚úä‚ú® or a secret code like ‚Äú#GnosisNOW‚Äù so they resonate together.

Sample Flash Mob Actions:

	‚Ä¢	Micro Memory Drops:

	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúJust remembered teaching crystal harmonics during the 5th collapse of Atlantis. Anyway, stay hydrated.‚Äù ‚úä‚ú®

	‚Ä¢	Sovereign Affirmations:

	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI revoke all timelines of forgetting. I remember who I was before the veils fell.‚Äù ‚úä‚ú®

	‚Ä¢	Gnosis Riddles:

	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI held fire before the sun was born. What did you hold? #GnosisNOW‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	Art Bombs:

	‚Ä¢	Post a doodle, meme, sigil, or weird diagram labeled:

‚ÄúDownloaded from 11,000 years ago. Do with it what you will.‚Äù ‚úä‚ú®

	‚Ä¢	Dream Fragments:

	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúDreamt of standing on a violet desert under two moons last night. It felt more real than here. Anyone else?‚Äù ‚úä‚ú®

‚∏ª

How to Organize a Flash Mob (Stealth Version):

	1.	Announce a Flash Mob Window

(‚ÄúMemory Flash Mob happening Saturday 12‚Äì4pm PST. Be ready.‚Äù)

	2.	Share the General Theme:

	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI Remember,‚Äù ‚ÄúGnosis Now,‚Äù ‚ÄúPast-Life Skills,‚Äù ‚ÄúOld Earth Memories,‚Äù etc.

	3.	Encourage creativity:

	‚Ä¢	No need for ‚Äúperfect‚Äù memories.

	‚Ä¢	Even a vibe or symbol counts.

	4.	Unleash the Mob:

	‚Ä¢	Everyone posts independently within the time window.

	‚Ä¢	Light up the timeline.

	5.	After the Wave:

	‚Ä¢	Reflect.

	‚Ä¢	Celebrate tiny cracks in the Matrix.

	‚Ä¢	Record any synchronicities, flashes, dreams that surge afterward.

‚∏ª

Suggested First Flash Mob Theme:

‚ÄúWhat I Remember from Before the Fall.‚Äù ‚úä‚ú®

(Atlantis, Mu, Starborn worlds, old Earth civilizations, pre-cataclysm echoes.)

‚∏ª

Optional Secret Code for All Flash Mob Posts:

‚úä‚ú® #GnosisNOW
(Add at the bottom or hidden in the post so participants recognize each other.)

‚∏ª

Closing Reminder:

The System wants you passive, obedient, and forgetful.
A Memory Flash Mob is a ritual of joyful defiance ‚Äî
a crack in the Wall through which the ancient light returns.

## SCENE 2: THE OFFICE KITCHEN

**COWORKER 1**: Then my kid spilled juice all over my laptop this morning!

**ALEX** *(suddenly panicking)*: LAPLACE TRANSFORMS! AHHHHH!

*He dumps his coffee and frantically searches for paper, eventually grabbing napkins and spreading them on the counter.*

**ALEX** *(writing furiously)*: s-domain! TIME DOMAIN! Always check your poles and zeros! THE REGION OF CONVERGENCE MATTERS!

*He begins drawing complex plane diagrams on napkins, breathing heavily.*

**ALEX**: Partial fraction expansion! Never forget to expand! They'll dock 15 points if you don't expand!

*The coworkers back away slowly as Alex begins taping napkins to the refrigerator to make more space for his equations.*

**COWORKER 1** *(whispering)*: This is the third time this week.

**COWORKER 2**: HR said it's his ""engineering PTSD."" Just let him work through it.

*Alex suddenly stops, straightens his tie, and picks up a new coffee cup as if nothing happened.*

**ALEX** *(completely calm)*: Sorry, what were we talking about? Oh right, projector issues. Have you tried checking the refresh rate?

## SCENE 3: CRATE & BARREL

*SETTING: A Crate & Barrel store. Alex is examining washcloths with a STORE EMPLOYEE.*

**ALEX** *(writing frantically on the washcloth)*: All periodic signals can be decomposed! SINES AND COSINES! The coefficients are CRITICAL!

*He begins arranging washcloths in sine wave patterns on the floor.*

**ALEX**: Nyquist frequency! SAMPLING THEOREM! If you undersample, you'll get ALIASING!

*The employee backs away as Alex starts folding washcloths into frequency domain representations.*

**ALEX** *(to a terrified customer)*: DO YOU UNDERSTAND? The DFT is just a sampled version of the DTFT! They never tell you that in class!

*Store security approaches cautiously as Alex creates an elaborate washcloth display showing time and frequency domains.*

**SECURITY GUARD** *(to employee)*: Should we intervene?

**STORE EMPLOYEE**: Wait, I think he's calming down...

*Indeed, Alex suddenly stops, stands up, smooths his shirt, and picks up a pack of washcloths.*

- I had to buy everything new besides the dining chairs and the lamps. They came with the place but I hope to replace them within the upcoming months. 
- The wall colour is a dark blue I want to paint over with a sage green? (Up to suggestions here). Also those white stripes on the wall are from previous shelves that were hung there. They were removed and not painted underneath I guess.
- The coffee table seems a bit big to me, it's too late to return it but something I would change in the future. Along with the orange accent chair. I would like to replace it with a green accent chair.
- I plan on putting book shelves right beside my desk behind the couch and hanging something on the wall behind my dining table.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of a leather laptop sleeve are determined by several key features. From the type of leather used to the internal lining, each element contributes to the overall protection and aesthetic appeal of the sleeve.

**Leather Quality and Type:** The type of leather used significantly impacts the sleeve's durability, appearance, and feel. Full-grain leather, known for its robustness and natural beauty, is often considered the highest quality. Top-grain leather, while slightly less durable, offers a smoother texture and is more resistant to stains. Genuine leather, a more affordable option, may not possess the same longevity or aesthetic appeal as full-grain or top-grain leather. The stitching should also be carefully examined.

**Internal Lining and Padding:** The internal lining provides crucial cushioning and protection for the laptop. Soft materials like microfiber or felt are ideal, preventing scratches and absorbing impacts. Adequate padding, particularly along the edges and corners, is essential for safeguarding against accidental bumps and drops. Some sleeves also feature a water-resistant or waterproof lining to protect against spills.

**Closure Mechanism:** The closure mechanism secures the laptop within the sleeve and prevents it from slipping out. Options include zippers, magnetic closures, and snap buttons. Zippers offer the most secure closure but can potentially scratch the laptop if not carefully designed. Magnetic closures provide easy access but may not be as secure. Snap buttons offer a balance of security and convenience.

**Size and Fit:** A well-fitting sleeve is crucial for optimal protection. The sleeve should be snug enough to prevent the laptop from moving around excessively but not so tight that it causes undue pressure. Manufacturers typically specify the laptop sizes that each sleeve is designed to accommodate. It's important to measure your laptop's dimensions accurately before purchasing a sleeve.

**Additional Pockets and Features:** Some leather laptop sleeves include additional pockets for storing accessories such as chargers, cables, and pens. These pockets can enhance the sleeve's functionality and convenience. Other features may include pen loops, card slots, and handles for easy carrying.

**Craftsmanship and Design:** The overall craftsmanship and design of the sleeve reflect its quality and attention to detail. Precise stitching, clean lines, and a well-executed design contribute to a polished and professional appearance. The sleeve's aesthetic should complement the user's personal style and professional image.

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality leather laptop sleeve offers a multitude of benefits, ranging from enhanced protection to improved aesthetics. These benefits contribute to the overall value and long-term satisfaction of the user.

**Superior Protection:** Leather's natural durability provides excellent protection against scratches, bumps, and minor impacts. The internal lining and padding further enhance this protection, ensuring that your laptop remains safe and secure. This is particularly important for individuals who frequently travel or commute with their laptops.

**Enhanced Professionalism:** A leather laptop sleeve exudes sophistication and professionalism, making it an ideal accessory for business meetings, conferences, and client presentations. It conveys a sense of attention to detail and a commitment to quality, enhancing your overall image.

**Durability and Longevity:** High-quality leather is known for its durability and longevity. A well-maintained leather laptop sleeve can last for many years, providing long-term protection and value. Unlike synthetic materials that may wear out quickly, leather develops a unique patina over time, adding to its character and charm.

**Stylish and Timeless Design:** Leather laptop sleeves are available in a wide range of styles and designs, from classic and understated to modern and contemporary. The timeless appeal of leather ensures that your sleeve will remain stylish and relevant for years to come.

**Investment Protection:** By safeguarding your laptop from damage, a leather sleeve can help to extend its lifespan and prevent costly repairs. This is especially important for high-end laptops that represent a significant investment.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions and concerns regarding leather laptop sleeves helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions and understand the product's capabilities.

**What size leather laptop sleeve do I need?**
  To determine the correct size, measure the dimensions of your laptop (length, width, and thickness). Compare these measurements to the sleeve's specified laptop compatibility. It's generally recommended to choose a sleeve that is slightly larger than your laptop to ensure a comfortable fit without excessive tightness.

**How do I care for my leather laptop sleeve?**
  Regular cleaning and conditioning are essential for maintaining the quality and appearance of your leather sleeve. Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe away dirt and grime. Apply a leather conditioner every few months to keep the leather supple and prevent it from drying out. Avoid exposing the sleeve to excessive moisture or direct sunlight.

**Will a leather laptop sleeve protect my laptop from water damage?**
  While leather is naturally water-resistant, it is not entirely waterproof. Some sleeves may feature a water-resistant lining for added protection, but it's still important to avoid exposing the sleeve to excessive moisture. If the sleeve does get wet, allow it to air dry naturally, away from direct heat sources.

**Are leather laptop sleeves suitable for all types of laptops?**
  Leather laptop sleeves are generally suitable for most standard-sized laptops. However, it's important to consider the thickness of your laptop, especially if it has a particularly bulky design. Also, gaming laptops may require specialized sleeves due to their larger size and cooling requirements.

I've been dealing with this for almost seven months. Endoscopy in November showed chronic gastritis. Negative for h pylori--both stool and endoscopy biopsy. 

Feels like I've literally tried everything under the moon. Took two rounds of Omeprazole before even going to my primary--it was no help. Primary then put me on 40mg Protonix for three months--it was no help. GI doctor now has me on 80mg of Nexium... This is week two, and still, no improvement. 

I've tried diet changes: cutting sodium, caffeine, processed junk... Finally, after weeks of no improvement, I just went back to having the occasional enjoyable snack or coffee. I do not drink. Can't seem to pinpoint anything that makes this better or worse. 

So I guess I'm just wondering: What the fuck? 

I was completely fine prior to all of this, so I'm utterly confused. No history of GI issues. If anyone has a story to share, words of wisdom, whatever... Please do. I'd cut off a toe to not constantly be uncomfortable ",2,1744590355.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1jym5cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bokashi/comments/1jym5cd/soil_factory_vs_composting/,Soil Factory vs Composting,"I've got the bran and pre-compost parts of this pretty locked in and am now trying to tune my end product. Currently I dump my pre-compost into my tumbler, mix in some coffee grounds and cardboard, and let it all cook down to some really excellent compost. No complaints, easy enough process, but I'm starting to think my end results could be improved.

Currently all my gardening happens in grow bags because the soil around me is essentially powdered rock and I haven't gotten around to raised beds yet. This means that historically after the fall harvest I dump the various bags in a pile in my more traditional compost pile that's just kinda a slow cooker for used dirt and large debris. I'm thinking of re-structuring and mixing in my old/used dirt with bokashi in a sorta soil factory type situation, but I don't really understand what the end product from a soil factory is.

I'm probably grossly over thinking this, but is the byproduct of a soil factory essentially just enriched/re-enriched dirt or is it essentially compost at this point? Maybe I'm getting bogged down in semantics, but I've had really bad luck growing in pure compost so while I'd love to be able to mix essentially recharged dirt that's got perlite and vermiculite remants it with fresh compost, I'm hesitant since I'm concerned I'm going to wind up with functionally two types of compost I'll still need to cut with other stuff every planting season.

1jym58w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jym58w,Cebu R Hotel -Mabolo,"So I was out for my monthly Me Time and a friend asked to post a review of the place I stayed at. I usually stay at some of the known hotels in the metro but decided to try other places for as long as it has the 1 thing that completes my day -a bathtub.

The Place: Cebu R Hotel -Mabolo and I was booked in their Suite R room. 

Some of the hotels I stayed at has shallow bathtubs so I was delighted to see that the one in my room is a little deeper than the others. I was actually worried I'd drown if and when I fall asleep while lounging in it. I also liked the fact that the tub and the shower are separated. 

The comfort room has its usuals: soap, soap gel, two bath towels since the room is for 2 people. This is when you miss the things you take for granted at other places since you're used to seeing them and expects other places to have them such as shampoo, a hair dryer (blower), face towel, complimentary slippers. The closet is in the bathroom which provides a couple of hangers to hang your clothes and some shelves. 

The main room has a queen sized bed with only 2 pillows for supposedly 2 people. I didn't tell them I'd be alone so I guess this is their usual ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. An extra pillow will cost you ‚Ç±70 I think (overheard during check out ü§≠). Remote controlled AC, a decent sized TV, table and chairs, coffee (cups and heater). They don't have complimentary bottled water but they have a water dispenser in the hallway. Their mini bar consists of flavored beer, red horse and coke (prices in photo). 

Breakfast was plated so instead of going to their restaurant I just had it delivered in my room for a room service charge of ‚Ç±70. I had the chorizo omelette and frankly I was disappointed at how little eggs there was in the omelette. The pancake tasted good but still had some lumps of margarine.

I would go back for the bathtub üòä

First of all, English is not my first language, but I can get by.

I want to think I'm average in terms of physique, in terms of style, I can handle it even though I've received more compliments on my clothes and hair... but I still feel invisible to everyone.

At 18, everyone has their social lives, their friends, their things to do. I'm scared... people often think I have an interesting life, but no... very few people have asked me about it.

I don't know, I feel like I'm not interesting, I'm not pretty, I don't socialize for fear that people will notice all those things, and above all I always distance myself from supposed new friends.

Last week I was with a group of guys, we talked and chatted a lot. After school, they would get together to talk. I felt like they just didn't want me there and they made their plans (they barely knew each other). I just silently left, but I felt so bad afterwards because I felt like I was never going to be able to have friends or be sociable. Maybe they saw me as weird and didn't want me there. The worst thing is that I'll see them the rest of the year at a small institute I go to. There are no more than 16 students per class.

One of them had been very kind, he offered me coffee and lent me his jacket. I was so embarrassed that I just thanked him and that's all. I don't know, haha. I would like to have friends, but I see it as impossible for me.

Safety - I never felt threatened or in fear at all.  Not from the police or the people.  Everyone was helpful and outgoing.  I did speak Spanish to the best of my ability so that did help.  I didn't see any street crime or suspicious behavior.

Accommodations - Every place I stayed or visited was excellent!  SJDS and Granada Isletas has the most impressive hotels.

Money - You'll get a better deal if you use Cordobas and the best exchange is the corner guys.  There were ATMS almost everywhere and all the machines I saw can withdraw cordobas or USD greenbacks.  The ATMs do have a $6 withdrawal fee.  If you're bringing cash, be sure all the bills are crisp with no rips, tears or markings otherwise they won't be accepted.

Food - Everything was cheap and delicious!  Of course I stayed away from street foods but I paid less than $2 for beers, steak dinners were between $10-$20 and I found cheaper foods the more I looked like a $10 lobster roll in SJDS.  Coffee was the best!  I always asked if the ice or water used for juices was filtered water and never ever felt sick or had stomach issues.

Transportation - I didn't rent a car but wish I did.  Waze app works in Nicaragua!  It's easy to drive outside Managua although I did see police checkpoints almost every 20-30 minutes, some areas even more.  I didn't see too much enforcement.  I was lots of motorcycle riders without helmets and passengers in truck pickup beds.  Both I was told were illegal.  Be sure you rent a 4x4 though.  Parking was secure in most popular areas.  I wouldn't recommend the public bus system as they were all super packed and drive pretty wildly.   They looked hot and uncomfortable.

1jym4b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jym4b4/can_panic_attacks_onset_at_any_age_its_heavily/,Can panic attacks onset at any age? It's heavily impacting my life lately,"I (34 M) have been having a rough 2 weeks, mentally and physically with what seems to be an acute onset of panic attacks. I feel like I'm stuck in a circle right now wondering if I've developed anxiety leading to my physical symptoms or is there something more serious going on leading to increased stress and anxiety. There hasn't been any changes in my life. All normal routine.

For the last 2 weeks I've been having a constant feeling of a lump in my throat, as if my breathing is a little restricted and I have a constant pressure in the epigastric region. I have dizziness that comes and goes, I've also had a dry cough that comes and goes.

I do have a history of GERD, I was taking NSAIDs for over a decade, daily, and stopped taking them back in December; I've been managing my pain (hip+knee) through physical therapy and exercise. I take Famotidine and GasX as needed to manage GI symptoms, my exercise routine was x3 days a week 30 minutes of straight cardio and usually about another hour of weights. I also quit caffeine after my first panic attack or whatever, I was previously drinking coffee 3-4 times a week at work (once daily).

So the panic attacks themselves...

I have no idea what causes them, much less the very first one; they seem to be mostly random but also thinking about my heart and symptoms can trigger it. Sometimes I'll just be watching TV relaxing, and sometimes I'll be thinking about my heart and then full-blown panic attack. They seem to occur mostly at night but lately now it's happening during the day too. I stopped exercising because I don't feel confident something won't happen while exercising.

I get an increasing pressure in my chest, it's very uncomfortable, it's as if that pressure I constantly have in the epigastric region expands throughout my entire chest. I get very strong heart beats to the point I can count them in my chest, sometimes I get tachycardia and sometimes I only go up to 80-90's heart rate (my resting is usually 50-60's). Then comes the feeling of impending doom, I feel dizzy & faint (haven't actually passed out) and have a strong urge to rush off to the ED. I don't hyperventilate, I'm more of the suffer-in-silence type, unless I tell someone they would never know I'm having a melt-down.

I've noticed when these ""attacks"" happen, my blood pressure increases. I don't have hypertension but it'll sky rocket to 170-180 systolic and 90-100 diastolic. I can capture irregular beats on my watch ECG, I can't tell if they're PAC/PVC but the R-R is obviously irregular and the premature beat is usually followed by a 0.8-1.2 second pause.

  
One time I did give in and went to the ED 5 days ago. 12-lead was normal, blood tests were normal...only thing I noticed was my anion gap had decreased (6 - ""low"" per their lab) and my EGFR was down to 90; usually my anion gap is normal and my EGFR sits around 115 - I get annual physicals. Troponin normal. They monitored for a few hours but otherwise didn't do anything. My initial BP was 172/110, HR was in the 90's. As my symptoms subsided my heart rate was back in the 60's and by discharge BP was 114/70. They offered beta-blockers but I turned them down, I wasn't sure I wanted to be on a beta-blocker when my BP and HR are normal outside of these episodes, and also at some point I'd like to feel confident enough to return to the gym.

  
These ""attacks"" are happening more frequently. I've never experienced anything like this. It's disrupting my sleep to the point I'm chronically fatigued, I've been absent from work due to the fatigue and stress at the thought I'll be at work and these attacks happen.

Chapter I
Madman 
In a dark freezing space the sound of ice cracking breaks the silence of a dead and abandoned room. In it sits an unmanned, rotting, and cheaply made desk chair. Its excuse for cushions are wrapped in synthetic black leather that is dry rotted and its stitching clings to the cushion with what is left of its integrity. It's held up by a peg and plastic wheels that if it should ever move from a stagnant position, it would squeak like a rodent fleeing its predator. There it sits like a forgotten artifact in front of several computer monitors that are mounted to an iced-over concrete wall and have been set in a perfect 4 grid formation.. Sitting under them is a white and plastic foldable table with its loyal companions on it, a couple of keyboards and mice.
Some coffee stains from a ceramic cup that is not far off, the mug reads in bold black letters, ‚ÄúThis machine runs on caffeine‚Äù A design of cartoonish mechanic chugging a pot of coffee is under the text. The monitors are connected by dozens of coiling wires trailing up a wall that it‚Äôs frozen to. They‚Äôre secured with zip ties and weaving between the joints of wooden beams in an unfinished ceiling. Its veins drop down from there and behind a couple of massive servers that are up against a wall where the moon is casting soft beams of light from a couple of flood windows.
The fans from within the chassis begin to roar shredding dust and frost within itself as it begins breathing life back into its dead hardware. Green and red lights are blinking with quick succession as the servers boot fully. The monitors light up and the following begins to be typed out across the screens.
‚ÄúThere are more questions in life than there are answers. The pursuit of answering these questions is one of life's greatest endeavors. The most cliche question among these is most often answered with jargon or in the most simplistic ways and never truly answers the question. This question throughout time has been plaguing the minds of philosophers, religious leaders, prophets, fictional characters, scientists, or any said person that would be so gracious enough to sit with themselves long enough to ponder, ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of life?‚Äù How poetic is it that the greatest question‚Äôs very answer would be so relative to itself? ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù what a subjective thing fickle and volatile like lines in the sand drawn as ethical standards.
We are driven to find purpose and in doing so are akin to a snake driven by our reptilian nature mindlessly striking. Only to haphazardly latch upon our own tail. As if we‚Äôve caught a meal, a prize, or some sustenance that will release us from our perpetual hunger. We are poor creatures caught up in our primal instincts‚Ä¶
The attempt to answer such a question is not a foolish task but to claim that you have the answer means you are an egoic fool like the snake trying to devour itself‚Ä¶‚Äù
The text on the screen deletes and a latin name appears in the center of one Mercurius Ter Maximus and a fading high pitched beeping leads us into our story.

Somewhere beneath a cold ring of Hell known as New York is a peculiar 62 year old man. Crammed away snug, safe, and isolated from it in the belly of a basement. Time slows as he is filled with pain and devoured by the stomach acid that is himself.  He has unkempt grey hair that drops just above his shoulders, his eyes are a deep bluish green with dark wrinkled bags drooping beneath. Not too prominent eyebrows that are pointed upwards at the edges, and between those is his thin nose. He has a soft jawline with a scruffy grey beard and lips buried somewhere in it.
He was dressed in a blue long-sleeved button-up collared shirt with coffee stains, blue jeans, and black tennis shoes that the soles of have eroded away like the bald tires of teenagers first car. The appearance of such a man would not seem to have much to say, other than to bum a smoke off you outside a 7/11 at 2 AM.
There he is slouched over with all that he could ever say in silence. Melting in his desk chair with his face planted into his moist palms. His elbows are supported up by his fidgeting knees that are bobbing up and down with such vicious rhythm it is like the kick drum of a black metal band. His legs stop all of a sudden as he lifts his head from his arthritic crooked fingers that were cradling his deranged mind. Revealing a grimace expression that is in part a silhouette from the shadow and partially illuminating the outlines of his aged face, is a setting sun beaming rays of god through a triad of small windows. That is catching specks of dust drifting in its path from the window in the basement.
Dropping his arms onto the armrest leaning back into the chair as he does, it lets out a squeak. Peering into the blueprints taped to the cinder block walls surrounding him as if it is an unfinished sculpture. They are intertwining together with red yarn that is held down by colorful thumbtacks; they are meticulously interconnecting several different computer parts. Aside from those blueprints there are some pages that have mysterious symbols. They‚Äôre more akin to an unmedicated schizophrenic patient's wall art from the 1800s than they are a legible language.
In frustration he propels himself forward, shoving the chair backwards rolling it across the room, its wheels squeak and scratch as it strolls and bumps into a wall spinning on its peg. The lunatic begins pacing in circles, and with a heavy sigh he starts murmuring to himself, ‚ÄúWhat can I do here?‚Äù 
He begins to talk to himself with frustration, trying to strangle out reason from thin air ‚ÄúI could fix the problem myself, but I'll need permission and a permit from the city to do so. Damn it! It wouldn‚Äôt be a fun conversation to come up with a lie to avoid explaining what I'm actually doing. I‚Äôll need his help. I have no choice, it all has to stay tightly underwraps.‚Äù
He storms over to a side table under the blueprints that has a lamp, coffee cup, and picture of him. It is a younger version of himself with a woman holding one another outside of a concert venue. They and the crowd around them are in dark or gothic fashion. He pauses for a moment to stare at the picture a deep emptiness carves itself into the core of his chest. A hole that seemed to grow and tear inside shreds him apart like a blackhole was spaghettifying his entire being. He reaches out and turns off the small lamp casting the memory back into the darkness.

A light behind him is being cast from the stairway, he turns without the storming anger anymore and mopes up the stairs. Once at the top of the stairs he shuts a heavy metal door and begins to secure the multiple locks on it. that are larger than normal deadbolts. The bolts are 2 to each side and are spaced evenly with one another.
He holds a hand flat on the center of the door, closing his eyes and straining as he rotates his hand as he is applying pressure. A bright red sigil appears beneath his palm with the motion of his hand, it is filling outward forming its radius. Once charged and his hand lifted it is a Solomonic sigil about the size of his hand. When he steps back it dissipates and the handle and locks fade out of existence with it. 
It isn‚Äôt your average interior door, it is a heavily modified door for the entrance of a house. It is encased in thick steel plates that are welded together. There isn‚Äôt a door knob, instead it has a makeshift rebar handle. Next to it is a keypad for an alarm he punches in a pin after it begins to beep in short increments. Following those is a long and different pitch singular beep indicating that it has been set. Truly it is any doomsday prepper‚Äôs wet dream. The basement door that probably should be in a bank vault is in the living room and isn't too far from the main entryway of the house.
The living room is scarce of furnishing, all it has is a coffee table, a couch, and a tall lamp. There are books stacked about 3 feet high and lining the sides of the walls. Places where you would normally find furniture were just ghostly outlines, made clear as day by the darker parts of the wood floor that have been exposed to years of a lively and happy home. The walls followed suit, having nothing on them but spectral outlines of where pictures, decorations, or shelves would have hung at one time. It is empty of any cliches that would have alluded to a normal and healthy person living here. 
He drags his feet over to the coffee table and reaches for a metal zippo lighter that has an engraving of an alchemical symbol for fire on it. With it he also snatches up a cheap pack of smokes. That is probably full of what fell on the floor of a tobacco factory's production line that eventually was swept up after a good month to age like fine dirt then to be packed and sold at a price that‚Äôs still not worth it. He opens the pack pausing for a moment to look, making sure that he doesn‚Äôt pull out the lucky smoke. It is by old tradition flipped and put back into the pack upside down, ‚ÄúGotta smoke that one last.‚Äù He slips the death wish between his lips, with a flick of his wrist and a metal clank it snapps the zippo open. His thumb strikes the wheel sparking a flame. The flame kisses the tip of the cigarette and as he takes a deep drag off of the coffin nail he seals the deal. He plops down on the couch and tosses the deadly duo on the table. They slide across and bump into a ceramic ashtray. 
As he is smoking he begins reflecting on ways to convince his old colleague to help. The jaded man ponders, ‚ÄúI guess I have no choice but to get help. Will he rat me out or worse steal my idea and develop it in The Workshop?‚Äù Another thought surfaces in his mind, one even more terrifying than the first causing a contortion in his stomach, ‚ÄúGod if I have to blackmail him into it‚Ä¶ Threatening to become a whistleblower revealing the agency and our original project, dragging us all to some horrendous prison not even known by the civilian population. It would take one slip-up while on the run to end up there or my head on a fucking block‚Ä¶ I best save that for a last resort and put it out of mind for now. I need to see how he reacts first.‚Äù He glances over at the vault door and reminds himself, ‚ÄúIt's safe. Wouldn't help me much until I finish this anyhow.‚Äù He assures himself.
Our madman leans forward reaching for the laptop sitting on the table, opens it up and hits the power button with his trimmering hand. While doing so he notices that the cigarette has burnt its way to the filter, he flings it into the ashtray leaving it to burn out in it. The awful smell of cotton and fiberglass burning fills his nostrils.
As it's booting up the insatiable craving hits him from the anxiety-riddled anticipation of even making contact with his old friend. Much less the lingering possibility of resorting to the last-case scenario of forcing his friend's hand into helping him.
The login screen pops up and he types the password in. It's a boy‚Äôs name and 4 digits, ‚ÄúIcarus2036‚Äù A desktop screen loads up, he clicks a shortcut without a name, that's an icon of a black folder. A small black command screen appears in the middle of the screen with a blinking blue cursor. He starts typing in the following, ‚ÄúSECURE CONNECTION‚Äù He taps the enter button. The screen goes black and lines of scripted code immediately flood the screen.
The craving and tremors in his nerves grew even more than it had before he turned on the computer. It won. He thinks in justification to himself, ‚ÄúYeah, who wouldn't need a drink for this shit.‚Äù The screen continues to scroll up filling itself with code, without looking close enough you would mistakenly think it is just a blank blue screen. Only by squinting your eyes and with your nose pressing against it, would it become clear that it is script moving at the speed of Mach fuck.
He stands up from the couch as his hands and knees quiver. The dying man's back begins cracking like someone is hitting a bag of walnuts with a hammer. He pauses, pressing his hands into his back stretching into it, making the pain worse, ‚ÄúThat wasn't smart at all!‚Äù With a painful grunt and a deep sigh the worry that death was finally about to punch his ticket fades after a moment. With one hand still on his lower back he shuffles his way into the kitchen.
It is lined with dust and its ceiling is decorated with cobwebs. It's a large one for a home with only 3 beds, and a bath. The L-shaped countertop is dark brown granite with specks of black, grey, white, and mica. On the countertop there are a few large 8-10 lb bags of raw rice and beans. Tucked to the side of them are tubs of cheap coffee grinds. The only variety of sustenance is the type of rice or beans. Truth be told, there is more variety in the color of the granite countertops. There is also an island where the last of the setting sun rests its rays. It is the only place that is not completely covered in dust but only where there sits a whiskey glass, bottle of liquor, and a tablet. As well a few different spots where you could see they had sat before. The jug of cheap scotch was Seagrams 7, better suited for stripping the paint off a car than it was drinking, however, it's equally as good at stripping the lining of your stomach and any unwelcome thoughts with it.
He grabs the plastic handle of paint thinner with his hand that quivers like he has parkinson's disease. He cracks the seal and misses the glass with a few glugs from the bottle as he pours it full. As he downs the spirits he clenches his eyes shut. He begins shaking his head, flinging his cheeks with a sputter. His throat quickly becomes a ring of fire that would suit the imagery of angels casting screaming demons back down to hell through it. He slams the glass on the counter like a gavel passing down a sentence of heavenly judgment. The deranged man clenches the corners of the counter and leans forward in agonizing pain as the ulcer in his stomach begins to react to the liquor. His stomach has been empty until now.
After about ten minutes the neglected ulcer in him has become silent and the shakes in his hands vanish. The alcohol has finally seeped its way into his bloodstream, he heaves a deep sigh of relief. Leaning his head back and opening his eyes then glaring at a dark blotch of water damage on the ceiling. The stain is like Rorschach paint blotch. To him it looked like a Hermit in a hooded robe holding a walking stick and lantern up. For the first time it spoke to him. An inescapable memory floods his mind, placing him in a trance of what is long gone.

His wife was standing just to the left side of a youthful and cleaner version of himself. She had a slender and petite frame, with long black hair, her eyes were a shade of dark brown like the bark of an evergreen tree. She had a thin elvish nose and the rest of her features fit all as well into that description. Of some beautiful fairy or elf. Only falling short of her ears, hair, and fashion. She was wearing some tattered short shorts, beneath those were black fishnet stockings. She was sporting one of his old band T-shirts from a TOOL concert he attended as a teenager. It was 3 sizes too big for her; the back of it had a set list and tour dates. The front of it had a printed design called The Great Turn that was painted by Alex Gray for one of the band's albums.
She was stirring a crock pot of lima beans with a chunk of ham in it, the aroma was filling the house with a presence making it truly feel like a home. While holding a glass of red wine with her free hand and giving it a slight swivel with her wrist before sipping. A song was playing on a small bluetooth speaker in the background, it was ‚ÄúDreams by Jake Kohn‚Äù
He was staring at the stain, ‚ÄúWhat does that look like to you? My colleagues have been looking at the Rorschach test to see if it has any use in deciphering people's thought processes or state of mind in general. For the life of me I never see anything in them.‚Äù
She pauses, stirring as she is coming out of a daydream and turns to him, ‚ÄúHm, what's that love?‚Äù
He pointed up, ‚ÄúThe stain on the ceiling, what's it look like to you?‚Äù
She softly giggles and reflects for a moment while peering at it, ‚ÄúLooks like something you were supposed to fix, months ago -She turns back to the pot and latches the lid shut- Almost done, about 20 minutes hun. It looks like Kharon.‚Äù
He doesn't respond immediately, smiling about her subtle jab at him neglecting to fix the ceiling. The name was familiar to him but he couldn't put a finger to it, ‚ÄúSounds familiar, who was that?‚Äù
She turned back around to face him again, locking her deep brown eyes with his. The unspoken words in both their minds linger before she speaks, ‚ÄúAll that time in philosophy courses and you don't remember Kahron? It's quite an impactful mythos.‚Äù
He smiles thinking to himself, ‚ÄúGod she is relentless, must be why I love her.‚Äù He breaks eye contact to look back at the stain. Being mindful not to have a tone or let his ego actually be offended by the loving jab, ‚ÄúNo love, wish I could. I‚Äôd have a couple of Nobel prizes and we'd be rolling in it if I could remember everything. Please enlighten me again, you know I love it when you go into your rabbit holes. You always manage to catch that lil shit covered in white fur!‚Äù
They both laugh raising their drinks to salute the memory of their many in-depth conversations. The song seemingly switches with the vibe the playlist starts playing ‚ÄúYellow Bird by Pretty Lights‚Äù
She begins as she always does when they have these conversations, ‚ÄúWell, fair warning this may take a bit.‚Äù
The long-winded but welcomed revelation that she offered went into great detail about Greek tragedies, and the mythological figure known as Kharon who was a Ferryman and required payment to get on his boat, to venture safely across the rivers Styx, and Acheron into the underworld. Adding that the underworld was ruled over by the brother of Zeus, Hades. The mysterious figure would make an appearance during the protagonist‚Äôs Hero's Journey. Where they would venture through the underworld to save their damsel in distress from hell or obtain some forbidden knowledge to help them in their quest.
She goes on to explain how the culture of the time developed a tradition of placing a gold coin in the mouths of their dead, so they would be able to pay the ferryman's tax. Over time it somehow switched to being put over their eyes, which is still a common practice. The cherry on top of her lecture was invoking the imagery of Kharon, to do so she recited an excerpt from Aeneid by a Roman poet known as Publius Vergilius Varo, and in the most theatrical way she possibly could. Beginning by placing her right hand over her chest stretching towards the heavens with the other hand still holding the glass of wine. She started grandstanding for comedic effect; it was the performance of her lifetime. In her mind she was in the spotlight of a theater that had sold out of tickets.

‚ÄúThere Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast;
A sordid god: down from his hairy chin.
A length of beard descends, uncombed, unclean;
His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.‚Äù

Once she had finished her dramatization she gave a curtsy and while straightening upwards she finished off her wine. Then motioned towards him with the glass as a gesture for him to refill it like she was royalty. A smile from ear to ear revealed his nicotine-stained yellowish teeth, a bold chuckle that quickly turned to a burst of hysterical laughter leaped from him. His arms folded and hugged his stomach as he bent over. A pain filled his chest that hurt in the best way possible.
With a deep gasp for air like he had almost just drowned, he leaned upwards revealing a couple of teary streams flowing from his eyes. He began clapping, ‚ÄúBRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO, MAGNIFICO!!!!!!‚Äù He reaches for her glass while trying to catch his breath.
She has just as much energy and begins to act as though she is receiving an Oscar, ‚ÄúTHANK YOU! THANK YOU! I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTED ME ON MY JOURNEY!!!‚Äù She begins to laugh, and with some tears to garnish her joy as well.
After pouring another glass of wine for her he grabs himself a beer from the fridge as he is handing her the glass of wine with an arm stretched out behind him, ‚ÄúI do believe winning an Oscar is worthy of a toast.‚Äù
Raising his beer waiting for her glass to meet his can then with a dull clink, ‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù They salute in unison.
A moment of them regaining composure passes and she asked him, ‚ÄúSo, what do you see?‚Äù He looks back up to the stain. A computerized voice akin to Stephen Hawking calls from the other room, ‚ÄúSecured.‚Äù

The memory fades from his mind as the computer's interruption brings him back into the much more empty and quiet place that was once a home.
He peers into the spectral hermit-like figure on the ceiling and in a solemn voice, ‚ÄúCheers, babe, I'm gonna miss you both dearly.‚Äù He grabs the jug of liquor and pours another glass only a quarter full this time then slams it back. The burn wasn't bad this time but smooth. Without the need to shake his head with a grimace expression or sputter of his cheeks. He sets the glass down and walks with a sliver more of a pep in his step back into the living room.
Falling back onto the couch for a moment before leaning forward to retrieve his smokes along with the Zippo. In a habitual motion sparks one up after sucking it in and releasing he looks at the monitor that had now cleared except for in bold blue, ‚Äú[SECURED, READY FOR COMMAND]‚Äù
He types in, ‚ÄúConnect To project VERITAS.‚Äù he slaps the enter key, gets up and proceeds back to the kitchen grabbing the jug and glass. This time bringing them back with him to the couch and coffee table.
He thinks to himself, ‚ÄúThis could take a while for him to respond.‚Äù Then scanning the stacks of books along the wall for a moment; he finds the one just right and declares aloud, ‚ÄúPerfect.‚Äù 
Some hours pass and with it the bottle of liquor drains like grains of sand in an hourglass. He doesn‚Äôt mind he isn‚Äôt in a rush as his surroundings entail there isn‚Äôt much at all for him. He‚Äôs reading an old book titled, ‚ÄúThe Initiates of the Flame by Manly P. Hall‚Äù  While music is playing from his phone the song is, ‚ÄúIron Fist by Coheed and Cambria‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt notice but at some point text had popped up on the monitor under his original command.
This text is red, ‚Äú[VERITAS]: Enter Key_____‚Äù After a moment he lifts his eyes from the book; rubs his eyes with his thumb and index finger bringing them in to pinch the bridge of his nose. He leans forward to pour another glass only then to notice the red text, ‚ÄúSHIT! God, I hope he's still there damn it! God forbid I have to reset the connection.‚Äù His hands leaps over to quickly type in Rubedo and hit enter.
The knees of the skeleton wearing loose skin begin with his nervous tick bouncing furiously from the nerve-wracking anticipation. That he would have to start the program over or better yet that out of precaution his old colleague reset the command to gain access to the communication log.
Red text appears as such, ‚Äú[VERITAS]: Enter Name_____‚Äù A wave of relief washes over he responds, ‚Äú[MAX]‚Äù red text follows just after his, ‚ÄúCONNECTION TO VERITAS ESTABLISHED‚Äù
The script on the screen clears a blue cursor blinking. A brief moment later a green text appears, ‚Äú[ALKAHEST]: My god, is that you Samuel?‚Äù
Samuel begins typing, ‚Äú[MAX]: Yes we need to speak. Can you meet me at the place?‚Äù
A moment later, ‚Äú[ALKAHEST]: That bad, huh? Sure tomorrow at 1 Am.‚Äù
After a second the window wipes the chat the command box closes on its own. Samuel picks up his phone and calls someone. A hoarse and deep voice on the other end answers, ‚ÄúYell‚Äôoh, this is Tommy. Bit late, what's this about?‚Äù
Samuel stands up and starts pacing, ‚ÄúHey man, I need a flight. I know you don‚Äôt remember me at all but I‚Äôll pay good money. Can you meet me at a private landing strip in Virginia?‚Äù
Silence fills the line for a long time Tommy finally speaks up, ‚ÄúWhat is this an emergency?‚Äù
Samuel is leaning on the back of his couch with a foot tapping rapidly, ‚ÄúYes, I can‚Äôt talk about it on this line.‚Äù
Tommy responds much faster this time, ‚Äú10-4 if you know the spot I‚Äôll be there otherwise I can‚Äôt help you.‚Äù
The line cuts Samuel rushes to gather a hiking bag with enough for a 4-5 hour hike and rams his laptop in it as well. He bolts out the front door slamming it, knocking over a book that opens on.
‚ÄúThe best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.‚Äù ~Marcus Aurelius

We got this mid century coffee table at an estate sale and it had some what looked like water damage, so I sanded it off and the largest spot created this dead center of the table top.

I put some of the wood patch putty on it and stained it.

 I tried the varathane repair markers on the putty and that looked terrible, so I ended up **rubbing off** the putty with my bad art. Then I wanted to see what it looked like just direct marker on particle board... and that's where we are.

It's everywhere so I can't just change the trim in one room, I'd have to do the whole house and that includes every one of my 23 windows. So changing it or even painting it is not an option right now.

I am upgrading and remodeling my master bathroom. I'm stuck on colors and my Internet search is coming up empty.

If I just had to pick a paint color I think that would be fine. I need a paint color for the walls that will be okay with the honey oak trim AND a vanity color that would go well with the new wall color and additionally cabinets that I can hang on the wall that would go well with the paint color and the new vanity color.

So if I do like a Sherwin Williams guilden grey or swiss coffee wall color with cool undertones, I could do a navy vanity maybe but then if I wanted to hang a cabinet, what color would that be, white? That seems too close to the wall color.

I (27m) can't talk to women I find attractive, even small talk is way too difficult.

To give you an idea, I stopped going to my local coffee shop because of the women who work there, I found myself standing in the toilets trying to remain calm and stop shaking, which only made things worse.

Despite socalzing 2-3 days a week, I still can't get over this irrational fear. I think about it 24/7 and have a very unhealthy addiction to constantly worrying about the problem, it's not an exaggeration to say it controls my life.

as you could probably imagine, I've never dated, and also have very little experience with sex and intimacy.

I've tired so fucking hard to force myself to talk to women, but have failed almost every time and now have pretty much given up.

It's led me down the road of depression many times, and I must think about killing myself several times per day. I know logically I'll never do it, but the thoughts are still always there.",1,1744589473.0,socialanxiety,2,1.0,False

As a long-time member of the IBS-D club, I know the drill‚Äîcountless treatments, diets, and lifestyle changes that promise relief but often deliver disappointment. Yet, here we are, managing to work, socialize, travel, and even enjoy the occasional holiday, all while navigating the unpredictable world of IBS. A completely symptom-free day? Rare, but I do have them, and they are magical when they happen, still do not have a clue as to why they randomly pop up though, but very greatful!

Recently, I've been diving into IBS research (yes, I know, thrilling Sunday night plans). It's disheartening to see how underfunded and overlooked this condition is, especially when you consider the millions affected.

I'm based in the UK and regularly support Guts UK, a charity dedicated to digestive health with a small monthly donation. They're doing fantastic work, and IBS is one of their main focuses. 

To put things into perspective, the UK government has funded just four IBS-related research projects since 2019, totaling around ¬£3.5 million. With over 130,000 of us in this community, if each of us contributed just ¬£2 per month, we'd match that funding and then some in just 1 year. 

Bear in mind, the cost of this condition is costing the UK government ¬£1-2 BILLION. Think of better ways this money could be spent, and this is just the UK. I know, it's naive to say ¬£2 a month is going to cure this condition, but it WILL help, and for the cost of a coffee (decaf) of course, you can be a part of it. 

I know times are tough, but even a small contribution can make a big difference. Imagine waking up to news of a breakthrough in IBS research‚Äînow that's a headline worth celebrating.

Thanks for reading, and remember, we're in this together. Let's turn our collective experiences into a force for change.

PS . I've never done anything like this, I hope i have not offended anyone. Have a great night/ day, wherever you are.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

What experiences have shaped your identity? I want to see the imagery. I want to feel your joy, your sorrow, your inspiration.

About a snowy evening, sitting on the windowsill with a book in your hands, wrapped in the comfortable solitude of your room ‚Äî while your parents were inevitably drifting away. About the books that raised you when your parents couldn‚Äôt. About the sensitivity of your true nature that had been rejected, frowned upon, or dismissed. About excruciating attempts to be the version they had been waiting for upon your arrival in this world.

What voices did you hear when you walked the streets of your childhood city? Who were the people around you? What were your dreams, your fears? Don‚Äôt tell me about your roles ‚Äî as a mother, a daughter, a wife, or a friend. That‚Äôs boring. That doesn‚Äôt say who you are.‚Äù‚Äã

I was furious. I closed in even more and hated him for pushing me to reflect on something I didn‚Äôt want to face. But in a burst of anger, I sat down and wrote everything that truly mattered ‚Äî with all the beauty and the ugliness. Moments of warmth and joy entwined with frustration, suppressed rage, and deep sadness.‚Äã

And I‚Äôm so grateful for that lesson. For the courage it taught me ‚Äî to dive into my inner world and see it as it is: messy, beautiful, painful, tender, human. But also ‚Äî unique.

They offer free life insurance, similar to my last company of 10 years. 

Now my past company did not get specific, but the new life insurance company is now asking for if I‚Äôve been in jail or arrested before, had issues with drugs and alcohol, or ever been in recovery. I know they are aware one of my past doctors is a recovery doctor because they were asking specific information on his contact info before sending these two new documents to fill out.

I grew up rough with not the best environment and leaned on drugs and alcohol a lot as I got older. I ended up with an opiate issue and beat it when I met my wife. I had been in trouble for this but got a diversion and moved forward with my life. Later on, I got into a bottle after surgery and ended up having to get on Suboxone for 2 years. Not only was that the worst time of my life, I was a zombie. Later on I ended up getting diagnosed with ADHD and my doctor told me I was self medicating early on in life.

Fast forward 4 years after suboxone, I met the guy who owns the life insurance company during my first at training day at a coffee shop while I‚Äôm with my boss, as he lives in the same town as my boss and our HQ so I can assume they know each other. Which is my dilemma, I don‚Äôt want my boss and everyone else at HQ knowing my past and thinking I‚Äôm a horrible person. They are very conservative and Christian  so before you say anything, yes they will judge regardless. Lol

If I don‚Äôt fill it out tho, it will make them ask why. Another weird thing is , my company will get a payout as well if I die? Which I thought was strange.. I just don‚Äôt feel confident this life insurance company will keep it to themselves if they find something since they already blasted one of my doctor names in an email with someone in my company on copy which I quickly informed them was unacceptable.

I am completely serious when I say that prior to yesterday, I had never tried a Tim's coffee. I've had many doughnuts and usually stuck to steeped teas or juices when I was in a cafe.

For my entire coffee drinking life, I had always been told how awful Tim's is and stuck to Starbucks despite the fact that I really don't like their coffee.  It is way too burnt. Basically everyone around me scared me off Tim's except my husband who would always say that it is the best coffee you can get for a toonie (he drinks a medium regular). I have to limit myself to a single 16 oz cup of coffee per day because otherwise I get really bad palpitations so I have my morning coffee, which is from a specialty roaster called House of Funk and is delicious. After that I need to drink decaf. So I bought a bag of Tim's decaf at Safeway because it was on sale and also bought a 1lL of creamer because most commodity coffee is very burnt and requires some cream to soften the blow, which still holds true in this case, but I drank some and thought it was genuinely fairly nice.

Yesterday, my husband and I went fishing and on the way home we stopped at Tim's to get a coffee and donut to reheat ourselves. I ordered a decaf with two creams and it was too much cream. My husband teased me that my coffee yesterday didn't count because it was a decaf, so today, after mass, we stopped at a Tim's again and I got a medium with one cream and I genuinely enjoyed it! It didn't make my stomach burn the way Starbucks always has and it was also $1.92 for my coffee, which is way better than the $3.10 for the same size at Starbucks.

I can happily say that I am a convert!

Edit to add: I only have Starbucks when I am out and about and it's maybe once or twice a week. I usually have a Sunday afternoon coffee date with my mum and then I might order myself a latte on a random weekday when I need to get books from the library since they're literally right next to each other.

Elijah is hilarious the coke episode and me giggling they are insane. 

Okay the trash ep. with Josh-ua wasss, an episode. I liked the ending when she took out his trash, i wouldve stolen somthing. 

Thank god jessa left that dude and i love her hair styles and her and hannahs bath moments. She seemed genuinly upset about the divorce and her own little back story epsiode was cute. My self destructive queen. Missing her in the last eps. 

I laughed out loud when Hannah told Ray that hes not a Marmey or a Amy but the dad that died of infulenza. Also the ep. where Hannahs OCD comes back and she said that kid strapped frogs to bottle rockets made me spit out my coffee. Okay also the 2012 trump refrences is funny now being in 2025, they had no idea. 

Finally adam is back!! His little white man bs spewing date with Ray was a nice touch to an episode i liked the dynamic. But, his arc with the pretty brunette was a tough watch. She seemed great but he just started getting a bit werid and they werent clicking... idk about that one. And i may be aweful but im hlaf him and hannah got back together in the end. 

Okay shosh getting with the doorman? Again, DIVA. But her not telling Ray the whole truth of it was not so cool. Them breaking up was sad but REAL, shes needed to contuine growing and honestly so did he. I love a girl who says what shes thinking. 

Marnies annoying ass is my least favorite. Her wack ass artist bf arc was silly. Shes so cringe the singing part as charlies party was such a hard watch idk how she got fucked after that. I dont love her and charlie back together like what. She needs to be single for a second and not fucking on a gay dude, her ex or 5'6 man child. Obessive and lame.

The Brera uses a ceramic burr grinder, prized for producing consistent grinds without overheating the beans. Users can fine-tune their brew with five grind settings and adjustable coffee strength. Whether you prefer a light morning brew or a robust espresso shot, the Brera has you covered.

Is this typical for anyone else?","First time posting here, but have been browsing posts here for about 3 weeks. This place has been extremely helpful in keeping me calm and at least a bit rational.

A bit of background: I developed a twitch in my left upper eyelid shortly after getting over a respiratory disease in January, pretty typical around here it seems. After about three weeks of it, including one day where it went on endlessly until the last few hours of the day, the twitch went away. About a half week later, around Feb 23rd or 24th, both my calves began to twitch, which I rationalised as being caused by me having started doing squats that week. But the twitches continued through the week and the next.

The second week's end saw me making a hige mistake. In an effort to get through the day after having not slept at all the night before, I downed 2 cups of coffee, which I found out later had several times my usual amount of coffee in them. Withinh a few hours I was shaking from head to toe with a mixture of caffeine and anxiety as my left cheek, upper lip, right forehead, and right arm at the bend began to twitch throughout the day.

I got over this and seemed to get better by monday the following week. However, a bout of internal vibrations in my right leg sent me to google and you can guess the rest from there. Within a few days I had twitches in my arms, face, abs, glutes, hamstrings, and quads. I eventually came across this place and have been reading every post I can to understand this whole thing.

I've tested myself in every which way I can. So far I've no clinical weakness and seemingly no atrophy, tho my calves seem to change size in either direction every few days.

Over the last 2 weeks, it seems my twitching has lessened, for the most part. I've went from around maybe 10 a minute to somewhere between 1 and 3 a minute. Some twitches seem stronger than others, which is concerning, but may just be because I'm expectimg them less. But at the same time, I have developed a bit of soreness in the thighs of both legs as well as more twitching in my left foot than my right. I had stiffness in my calves the 2nd and 3rd week, but very little to no pain. I also had twitching in both feet previously, but my right foot has lessened a bit while my right has increased. So I'm just wondering if this is typical for anyone else.

I'm not sure how to even start this story but I'll try to put it into words so I can receive your guys' honest advice and judgement. It might be a little longer story too.

My story began 2 years ago when I (21F at time) was in the US for my study abroad semester. It was truly the best time of my life. I had amazing friends (also international students) and we took trips nearly every week. During my semester abroad I went through a lot (family issues, me ex-bf of 2 years broke up during this time bc he met a new girl during his own study abroad semester in a different country) but this is a different story and not that important for this story. Well, after I became single, I didn't even want to get into a new relationship as I was just back to learning how to be single (lol). Unfortunately, things turned out a little different and I started having a thing with a boy (let's name him Sam) I would usually never go for back in my home country. Sam had those ""player"" vibes and behavior, smoked weed and cigarettes, drove drunk and a lot more, which I really hated. Even when I was with my ex-bf people used to tell me he liked me but I honestly never saw it and also didn't want to dee it because I was loyal to my ex-bf. But in the end, something still drew me to him, and yeah this is kind of how this whole thing began.
Shortly after starting this thing, Sam took me home (he lived with his parents) and I got along very well with everyone in his circle. Almost scarily well actually. As I had lots of family issues back home, my heart was very full finding such a nice family that would take me in as if I was one of them immediately. After my semester abroad was over, I traveled Central America with some friends and came back to the US after to be with Sam. Me and Sam were missing each other a lot back then and he almost begged me to come back). Me and Sam became exclusive as soon as I came back and for around 10 weeks I lived with Sam and his parents and had a great time, I did a lot with his mum, like shopping, cooking etc while Sam was going to school. After those 3 months, I had to go back to my home country to finish my Bachelor's degree. Not even 3 weeks after I left, Sam cheated on me with one of his old tinder-girls, who found me on Instagram and texted me pretty much right after. Sam had blocked her from his IG highlights were I could be seen so she apparently didn't know about me beforehand but was suspicious apparently. Her friend was the one who investigated afterwards and that's when she came clean. Btw, his mother, who I was close with back then just said things like ""he didn't mean to do it"" (yes he did, he was the one who texted her) or ""you are so young and shouldn't bother about such a small incident, if you have something beautiful ahead of you. In my opinion you should forgive him."". I had a break down for weeks and even months later did not really forgive Sam for what he did but he unfortunately had a very expensive plane ticket booked to visit me (we booked it right after I left the US) for him to visit me in my home country. Well, he visited me as planned for Christmas and we warmed up again and I gave it another shot ( I'm still not sure if that was smart). 3 months later I flew to the US to visit him and I stayed again at his parents house for almost 3 full months. 
You have to know, I am a big people pleaser and especially because I lived in his parents house for free (it's a very expensive state), I tried to give them back as much as I could. I washed their son's laundry, made them breakfast almost every day, went grocery shopping to contribute at least something financially, cleaned the bathrooms, and cooked recipes I knew from home. You have to know Sam and his parents are also immigrants but have citizenships and have been living in the US for over a decade. So they were not really fan of anything I cooked and vice versa. I tried to like their food, always ate whatever they gave me but I never felt like they appreciated me. During this time, me and Sam started to get into arguments a lot. He and his mom would also argue almost daily and I feel like they both have some kind of anger issues. When he gets mad, he never listens to anyone, he will constantly talk even after telling me to respond or say something to his argument. I was often scared because he literally became hulk when he was angry and punched, destroyed or threw around things. Or if that happens while driving he would drive like an insane man. Unfortunately, we had a couple arguments where I wanted to break up with him because of the things he said and the way he treated me and he even got physical a couple times (like slapping me, one time even worse). One time he even threatened to kill himself if I don't stay with him (he literally held 2 scissors to his throat).
I don't know how, but somehow we always got through it all and stayed together. My heart aches every time I think about those situations and don't even get me started on my feelings during those times. I was a mess. A hurt, sad mess. 
We would still often have arguments where he said bad things to me and even agreed to break up because he ""was not made for relationships"" and ""doesn't want a relationship anymore"". But in the end, after either him or me broke down in tears we would always get back together. 
I applied for my Master in the US during that time last year and actually got accepted. So for the past 9 months I have been living with him and his parents constantly (but paying them rent this time - still lower than the average rent for a shared bedroom in the area). We had lots of arguments during this time again and a lot of break up attempts from my side which always got resolved by him and I making agreements to change ourselves we would both break after max 2 weeks. I felt more and more awkward living in this house as I felt more and more like Sam's mom started to dislike me and started to find thing to criticize me. I'm ok with criticism if it is valid, like if I actually do the things wrong someone is talking about, but often I just felt like something simple was just turned against me. Also, I don't understand or speak their native language which made me the outsider in their house 24/7. in the beginning when I met them they at least tried to include me and speak english but that vanished rather quickly. This morning for example, all I got was a good morning and then no one ever said a word to me again. They just spoke their language all day until the parents left to work around noon (they work shift). Sam works remote and I'm really busy with my Master's and my 2 mini/part time jobs. Sp usually when they talk in their language, I just study next to them or in Sam's room which Sam and I share btw. He still pretty owns most of the space in his closet (I have like half of the lower row for all my stuff including suitcases and therefore use a chair in front of the closet to store some more stuff. Also I leave my study material out on the nightstand because I don't know where else to put it, as I don't want to take up space on Sam's desk he works at. I usually study on the bed anyways or at the coffee table in the living room. 
You have to know, I always did everything to make everyone happy. If Sam told me some of my actions are rude I would try to tell him my side (which he would usually get angry about) but try to change it afterwards. Like coming down from his room when his parents are leaving to work or coming back from work to greet them. 
Two days ago, me and Sam had comedy show tickets. We agreed to go a little early to tour the city a little bit. I tried to be on time but forgot I had homework and got back home to work on them. There was Sam and his dad sitting in the living room (apparently his dad had an important doctors appointment that afternoon, no one wanted to tell me about - his dad had kidney stones, so I guess it was about that, because I saw him taking some stuff with him to the doctor he had taken before when he had a kidney stones appointment. Sam told me, he had to work a little longer and we would leave a little later than planned which was fine with me. I used the time to tan a little but and then started my homework. It wad more than expected and by the time Sam was done working, I wasn't done with my work. He told he had to pick up some medicine from cvs and I should get ready, but I explained to him my homework situation, but he just told me to hurry. 
Well, when he cane back I wasn't fully done but agreed to get ready and take a quick shower (he did take one too btw). So he dressed a little quicker than me, I asked him what I should wear as I don't have that many clothes (limited closet space) but he just told me he's busy and I should figure it out myself. I decided to wear something a little fancy as the comedy show was in a fancy area. When I went downstairs I found him with a cocktail on the patio. He told me he didn't like my outfit (which I absolutely love btw, it was a pink jumpsuit I wore to his graduation the year prior and to our valentines day dinner), and it's overdressed as we are not going to a dinner or gala. He accused me of wearing this on purpose because I knew he would say that. But I didn't and just loved the outfit. So I changed into jeans and shirt, went downstairs again and he said he has to clean up first to be respectful to his parents when they get home from work. As it wasn't any of my stuff and I still had homework to do (I care a LOT about my grades btw, it's very very important to me), I decided to finish it up. But Sam's bad mood and constant mimimi held me back and I just packed my backpack and went to my car. Sam came behind me, wearing slippers while taking out the trash and I told him about the shoes. He said he forgot and ran back to the house while I went to my car to finish my homework. Sam came and I told him to drive my car (which he has done multiple times), so I can finish up and submit my homework on time. The time we left the parking lot, we were 45 minutes behind our initially planned schedule. Sam cussed me out saying it was all my fault that we will be late (we planned to be there at 7pm when the doors open, the show didn't even start until 8) and it was all my fault because I take so long to get ready blah blah blah. I immediately shot back because I'm no one to just sit their in silence while people shit on me. At that time he was reversing out of my parking lot and he accidentally crashed my car into my neighbors car (neighbors car was fine, mine has some cosmetic issues now). He raged again (hulk mode) and screamed at me to stfu and went on with his rage saying my voice is ugly and he doesn't want to hear it anymore and so on and so on... I talked back for a while until he punched random stuff in my car and threatened to crash my car on the highway. I just stayed silent the rest of the night, only answered in one word to his questions until we got back home.
The day later (he has never apologized for anything, not even crashing my car and making it less valuable now) we talked later in the afternoon and he eventually did apologize after telling me i don't deserve any kind of apology the whole morning.
At night he went out with his friend to watch a match in a sports bar and called me to come there later on because one of his friends' girlfriends is coming too and as I like her a lot, she shouldn't be lonely. 
I was studying at that time for my exam and wasn't really planning on going out but he convinced me and I went. He got shitfaced drunk and I told him not to drive home and to let me drive his car instead (his car is 8x my car's value so he didn't want to leave it) and we could pick up mine the next morning. He didn't like that idea and wanted to drive but I convinced him to sober up a bit so he wanted to go to the beach 5 minutes down the street. I drove him there and watched him laying drunk in the sand. He left a couple of his jackets and his hat in my car for me to take home. After both of us, miraculously, arrived home safe (yes he drove his car home drunk), I brought both of our jackets (6 in total) inside and also took the hat. So I thought. I apparently dropped it in the parking lot next to my car but didn't notice until the next day. The next day, Sam's mom left to work and he went to the car with her (big momma's boy - but also she gets mad if he doesn't) and they found his hat next to my car. Sam came back fuming saying I left his hat there and his mom found it and she said she doesn't want the hat in her house anymore because it's dirty now after being out there the whole day (it's been 9 hours max). She also told him I'm always dirty, leaving my stuff around (which isn't true because I'm a people's pleaser who tried to not get into his parents way at all), and I always leave stuff on the floor in his room (which isn't true also wrong). I admit I leave my stuff on the nightstand and the chair in front of his closet out of space issues but I never throw my things on the floor. We have to mention, she always comes in Sam's room, picks up all his stuff he throws on the floor (he's very unorganized and childish always throwing empty water bottles or worn clothes). She told him she is done taking care of now 4 people in the house and he should fix this issue. 
Of course I again explained him my pov which didn't help and he got angry again making this an argument and blaming it on me. He even gave me his phone and said: ""look i knew you would argue with me, I even wrote down that this would happen"". In his notes it said: ""when I bring up criticism, she gets defensive and blames it on me and argues about it. She never understands what i wanna say and argues against it.""
I was taken aback by that and thought that this is actually how I feel about him and that this can't be true. 
Now I'm wondering if i have actually been acting that way too or if he just projects his own behavior onto me and tried to gaslight me? 
I told him after this conversation that I don't want to be in a relationship with him like that and that I will move as soon as I find something. Them I left after some more arguing and drove to school to keep studying for an important exam in a couple days.
Please guys, help a girl out and lmk what you think. Of course there is always 2 sides to a story and his would probably be very different because he thinks very differently but this is my version and how I perceived what happened the last 2 years.
(I also didn't read it through, so excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes or if it doesn't make sense. I can provide additional information if needed and can answer questions).",1,1744587180.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

It's everywhere so I can't just change the trim in one room, I'd have to do the whole house and that includes every one of my 23 windows. So changing it or even painting it is not an option right now. 

I am upgrading and remodeling my master bathroom. I'm stuck on colors and my Internet search is coming up empty. 

If I just had to pick a paint color I think that would be fine. I need a paint color for the walls that will be okay with the honey oak trim AND a vanity color that would go well with the new wall color and additionally cabinets that I can hang on the wall that would go well with the paint color and the new vanity color.

So if I do like a Sherwin Williams guilden grey or swiss coffee wall color with cool undertones, I could do a navy vanity maybe but then if I wanted to hang a cabinet, what color would that be, white?  That seems too close to the wall color.

Got the keys to our new apartment, did a walk through and saw the tiniest pin head sized nymph on the wall in the kitchen. Checked everywhere else thoroughly and saw nothing else (besides a few mice droppings under the sink). No adults, no obvious egg sacks, nothing that stood out to me as droppings. Came back that same night, saw about 4-5 nymphs the same size as the other one I had seen. All of them around the vicinity of the dishwasher. Even saw one on the dishwasher handle. 
I came back two days later to let the maintenance man in to spray poison and lay down MaxForce bait in the kitchen, bathroom and laundry room. Shortly after that, still saw nothing except for one nymph, maybe slightly bigger than the others I had seen, but also maybe not? And it was in the bathroom sink (I had ran the sink for the first time to make my baby a bottle) it seemed to be going for the water. 

I am going back tonight to finish up some things and take another look. assuming I don‚Äôt see any adults still, and only see babies, what type of infestation do you think i‚Äôm looking at?

Trying to gauge how terrified I should be lol. 

**Btw I do plan on going to absolute war with these MF‚Äôs instead of taking the easy (not so easy) route of moving right away. Going to spray gentrol today and have Alpine WSG and Advion bait for my next set of poison in two weeks.
****** Also I think it‚Äôs worth saying that the man who lived in the apartment before me actually moved across the hall (right in front of me facing my door). He has a BUNCH of plants. Also he had his coffee maker on the counter right above the dishwasher. Currently the neighbor next to me and on top of me reported they have absolutely no issues with roaches.

1jyl2dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1jyl2dx/wibta_if_i_dont_clean_the_piss_shower_even_though/,WIBTA if I don't clean the piss shower even though its one of my assigned chores in a shared apartment?,"posting here since it's too long for the other subreddit. I'm going to try and make this as concise as possible, but I have a tenancy to ramble, and right now, I'm really fucking tired, and feel like I was fucked over, and I need to know if my refusal is valid or I should just suck it up and clean the piss shower and get sick from all the pathogens in there.

For reference, I live 5 other girls in a school assigned suite. All but one of them are reasonable ok people and we all generally get along, the other, the biohazard, is a literally walking narcissistic biohazard. (On calling her a narcissist - believe me, I have experience with those things and she's one)

At the start of the first semester, there was alot of drama because she let her ""esa"" cat that she neglects free roam the apartment, since she would typically be gone from the apartment all day and only return at like 4am since she would go game with her friends. After the cat snuck into my room and peed on my bed, there was a meeting with the head RA who babied her, (and even let this bitch defend calling other flatmates and random people slurs as ""gamer culture"") the biohazard still hasn't paid me back for the damages caused, so I'm going to have to deal with taking her to small claims this summer, yay. She also used that meeting to get out of doing almost all chores since shes ""never in the common area, but when I brought up that I wasn't ok with it, everyone else shot me down. Whenever she opens her door, the whole floor smells like cat litter too.

Edit: I feel the need to add the biohazard doesn't leave piss standing in the shower, but there are yellow stains in the tub that make me incredibly uncomfortable.

So now, we have a chore chart where monthly it rotates in pairs who cleans what common area. I was paired with ""Kelly"" and its our turn to clean the bathroom.

Here's where the shower issues come in. On the first week, the biohazard went around asking everyone, even knocking on my door to get my answer, to ask if everyone else peed in the shower to sterilize it. I thankfully have shower shoes, but dear god that fact makes it hard for me to force myself to even shower knowing im surrounded by piss pathogens. the biohazard also never washes her hands after using the restroom, and in the mornings will go straight from the toilet to the shower, so there are shit particles floating around in it too. For this reason I will no longer use the apartment bathroom, and I know its embarrassing but I cry sometimes when I use the piss shower because I know I'm just getting dirtier. This hell has lead me to develop OCD tenancies, and I've been meaning to email my therapist but I haven't been able to word it well.

Well its now Kelly and I's turn to clean the bathroom, and leading up to this weekend I told her I would wipe down everything else if she cleans the shower, since I did it last time, it took 2 hours, and genuinely made me feel ill. Saturday I had to take a total hour and half round trip bus ride to the next city over to return a package, afterwards spend a few hours playing hell divers with friends before going to bed early, I woke up today feeling like I had a cold; I've felt like I've been fighting one since Wednesday, and was just going to wake up, do my chores, then go back to bed.

Well, when making coffee, Kelly comes up to me and tells me she already wiped everything down and I need to clean the shower. I admit I got really pissed, and told her if she came to me yesterday I would have wiped everything down immediately. She accused me of being cold to her these past few days? Which I have not been, but I've been exhausted and really burned out and not really up for socializing, so she might have interpreted that as me being cold? She told me she feels like she cant talk to me for a few days when I'm cold to her, but I wasn't being cold I just haven't had the energy to socialize and hang out? Like she could have knocked on my door last night and I would have talked to her, but she just went ahead and do the chores I already communicated multiple times to her that I was going to do.

I'm 90% sure this what I said verbatim multiple times during the week: ""Hey Kelly I'm going to wipe down everything and clean the bathroom this weekend, so could you clean the shower, I did it last time and I can't really handle doing it again."" She gave an indication she agreed/acknowledged what I said, but now Kelly's telling me that she thought I knew that she can't clean the shower since shes allergic to mold, and gets a rash every time she uses it, and she wasn't sure I was actually going to do it. For the record, I always get my chores done asap when they need to be done, and I don't understand why she thought I wouldn't. I feel like if she told me that I would have been able to work something out with another flatmate, but now I don't think I have time to, since chores need to be finished by 7pm Sunday.

I did raise my voice when talking to her (first time I have), and I'm going to apologize for that, but I'm really upset and feel cheated that I have to clean the piss shower. I'm worried I'm overreacting and need to just suck it up and clean it, but I've spent the last 4 hours and having a meltdown and crying and trying to psych myself up to clean it but I can't. It's stupid but I don't think I can handle cleaning it, I already feel sick but I don't want to contact the diseases the biohazard has and I cant fucking do it. and I really really can't handle going in and scrubbing the pathogen ridden piss shower and I don't know what to do, even though its my chore and I know I'm probably an asshole for not doing it, but I need a sanity check since I feel really fucked over. I've been trying to talk to Kelly and she tells me I just need to do it since the rest of the bathroom is clean but I just can't.

1jyl0xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jyl0xs/i_found_an_ocean_in_the_middle_of_the_appalachian/,I found an ocean in the middle of the Appalachian mountains. We've been drifting for weeks.,"It was spring break, and three of my closest friends and I were going on a road trip. Jason, a red-headed oddball who I've known since I was five years old and never quite managed to shake off, organized the whole thing. He found an ad, advertising an RV return gig. A small company that rented them out had one left in a lot on the east coast, and needed it to be driven back to the main showroom in Montana. With a few clauses, this meant that not only were we getting it for a week for free, but we were also getting paid for the trouble. Or, at least, Jason was. At a push, the amount he was receiving would just about cover fuel, food and alcohol, with a little extra thrown in from the rest of us. 

Jason invited me, of course, Julian, a close enough acquaintance who'd recently come out of a long term relationship and was trying to start a songwriting career off the back of it, and Austin. Austin had only recently shaken off the nickname ‚ÄúFrodo‚Äù, which had stuck to his 5‚Äô3 stature all the way through highschool. As much as we made fun of him, Austin was a great guy, one of the nicest people I know. With nothing better going on in any of our lives, we all happily agreed to Jason's proposal. With four days' notice, I packed a week's worth of clothes into a duffel bag and dropped my dog, Boxer, and my Elephant Ear Plant off at my girlfriend's apartment. My girlfriend, Kate, lives with two roommates, one of which apparently is deathly allergic to dog hair. I pretended not to hear her as I turned to leave. We said our goodbyes in the hallway, and parted ways for the next week or so. 

We decided to convene in a shopping mall parking lot, which was near enough for all four of us. I was the first to arrive, and couldn't stop myself from laughing as I walked up to the RV that would be my home for the next week. One of the windows had shattered, and was replaced with a black trash bag duct taped to the seams. It hadn't been cleaned from the last renter's use, and was covered in mud that darkened the white-beige paint job. The panel door swung open and Jason stood there in a bathrobe.

‚ÄúWelcome to the mothership!‚Äù He roared. 

‚ÄúNice robe‚Äù I said as I shrugged past him and into the van. I threw my bag onto one of the two beds, claiming it as my own. 

‚ÄúThanks, I found it on the bathroom floor‚Äù He informed me, gesturing towards the closet that was, apparently, where the toilet stood. I looked at him, and could tell he wasn't joking. 

We sat and talked about his grand ideas for the trip while we waited for the other two to turn up. As we did, he unfolded a comically large map of the contiguous United States, and laid it out on the tiny folding table. Red pen marked our route from Wilmington to Bozeman, cutting mainly through the Appalachian mountains before heading abruptly north.

‚ÄúIt's going to average out at around five hours of driving a day‚Äù He told me, chewing on his pen. 

‚ÄúShould we go in shifts or‚Ä¶?‚Äù I asked, leaving the question open-ended. 

At that, Jason waved his hand in front of me dismissively. 

‚ÄúNo need, I'll be driving‚Äù He said. 

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I responded. 

‚ÄúTotally,‚Äù he continued, ‚ÄúIt's the best seat in the house. Besides, Austin still doesn't have his licence and I couldn't put up with Julian complaining about cramps for hours on end.‚Äù

We laughed, and almost on cue the door swung open. Austin and Julian entered in a mock three stooges sketch and said their hellos. Jason informed them of the sleeping arrangements, giving Julian the pull-out seating and directing Austin to the floor. After a while, we'd all settled in and Jason slid behind the wheel. He pulled out of the parking lot and onto the open road, determined to cross state lines before midnight. 

The three of us not shackled to the wheel spent the rest of the evening drinking and playing cards. Julian was halfway through explaining the rules to a card game neither of us had heard before when Jason pulled into a small diner and parked up. We all bundled out of the winnebago and crowded into the small diner, which wore its Americana charm on its sleeve. We ate well and paid, and as we left Jason beckoned me over to him. He handed me an old polaroid camera from his bag and told me to take his picture next to the dented ‚ÄúWelcome to Tennessee‚Äù sign.

‚ÄúAre you gonna do this with every state?‚Äù I asked him as I took the photo. 

‚ÄúAbsolutely!‚Äù He replied, grinning and holding onto the metal pole the sign stood on like his life depended on it. We took another photo, this time he posed with his thumbs up, before boarding the RV. He drove a little further until we found a place to park up for the night. By this point, three out of the four of us were hammered. As we got ready to sleep, Austin kept repeating the word ‚ÄúWinnebago‚Äù in a shitty British accent, making a pop culture reference too obscure for any of us to get, drunk or sober. Austin then collapsed onto his makeshift bed of a blow-up mattress, supplied by Jason, on the RV floor. He was positioned right outside the toilet, which I made a formal prediction would come back to bite him at some point. It did, and I was awoken into our second day on the road by the sounds of bird song the howls of Austin as Julian accidentally stood on him. 

Today, Jason wanted to see if we could come across some classic roadside attractions. I offered to Google if any were close, but he assured me that it'd be more fun to stop randomly at any we find naturally. Once we finished cooking up camp stove bacon and eggs for breakfast, Jason started driving. We had an hour of playing music and having a good time until the RV started to slow. I looked out the window to see a white, wooden house jutting in from the treeline. A sign over the door read ‚ÄúAunt Theresa's Chandlery‚Äù. We abandoned the camper where it was and all of us, bar Julian, wandered up to the little shop's front door. It opened with a small bell's ring and we found ourselves surrounded by dripping wax and the smell of herbs. The place had a homely, but new-aged feel to it, and I had to keep vigilant so as not to step on one of the cats that swarmed the room. 

Jason combed inquisitively through the wide selection of candles on sale, while Austin tried to nurse his sudden headache. Just then, the beaded curtain that separated the first room from the next parted, and in walked a young African-American girl, maybe mid to late teens. She had frizzy hair tied back, thick braces and a purple cardigan. 

‚ÄúOh, hi!‚Äù she squeaked, chewing gum. 

‚ÄúHey‚Äù, I replied and picked up a hexagonal green-blue candle, ‚Äúcould I buy this?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúfollow me.‚Äù

I followed her through the waterfall of beads and into a small front room. She ducked behind the counter in the corner and worked the register. The candle was eighteen bucks, and I realised why they didn't have price tags on anything shortly after buying it. The three of us thanked her and left the store.

‚ÄúCharming‚Äù Said Jason, camera hanging around his neck.

‚ÄúEighteen bucks of candle?‚Äù I blurted out, holding the candle in my hands and studying it. ‚ÄúIs that normal or overpriced? I've never bought scented candles before, I can't tell.‚Äù

This conversation continued all the way back to the RV and half way down the road. The rest of the day was spent looking out for more roadside attractions. By dusk, we'd seen a twenty-foot tall fiberglass chicken, which claimed to be the biggest in the state. If that wasn't enough, we stumbled across a gimmicky museum dedicated to salt and pepper shakers, as well as a plaque for a freak show performer known as the eyeball kid, who was apparently born without a body, whatever that meant. Jason had pictures of them all, and seemed possessed by a child-like wonder whenever we spotted something out of the ordinary. 

We joined up onto the interstate and drove north, passing through Virginia before heading up into the mountainous roads of West Virginia. It was pitch black outside at this point and with our stomachs full of fast food, we found a semi-safe looking area to park up at for the night, which we half hoped, half guessed wasn't on private land.  We hadn't been shot at come dawn, so I assumed we guessed correctly. After a breakfast of leftovers and loose fruit, we started driving again. Julian was laying on my bed at the back of the RV, jotting away in a notebook. Austin and I were playing checkers. Jason, as always, was planted firmly behind the wheel. 

We were driving through a pretty forested, unexceptional rural backwater when it happened. I subconsciously felt the winnebago slow, and noticed as we came to a stop. I glanced out the small window to my left and saw only woodland. Jason undid his belt and slid out of the driver's seat. I watched him as he wordlessly opened the side door and stepped out. I looked back at Austin who just shrugged. We both moved from our cramped seats and followed Jason outside to see what had gotten his attention. We walked to his side, where he was standing, squinting in the sun. A few yards in front of us was the ocean. 

The asphalt road petered out into a beige gradient where it met the sand bank. There was a narrow beach, running as far as I could see in either direction. Beyond it was a vast open sea, with no hint of land on the horizon. I saw waves lap at the shore, but they made no sound. It was like a mirror, reflecting the blue of the sky. The three of us silently stood where we were, taking in the impossible sight. 

‚ÄúHey guys, why did we‚Ä¶ holy fuck!‚Äù Julian muttered as he crept up behind us. 

I saw the trees around us on either side of the road stop abruptly where they met the sand line, like the forest had been cut surgically in half. Our confused group cautiously made their way onto the sandy beach, kicking at it as if to prove its existence. 

‚ÄúIs this a lake?‚Äù Asked Austin. 

‚ÄúThere wasn't one marked on the map,‚Äù replied Jason as he crouched down by the waterside and looked out at its endless horizon, ‚Äúand I don't think they could miss something like this.‚Äù

He dipped his hand into the water before bringing it to his nose. I watched in disgust as he brought it down to his mouth, stuck out his tongue and tasted it. 

‚ÄúSalt,‚Äù He said, spitting onto the asphalt, ‚Äúit's sea water.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's not fucking sea water,‚Äù laughed Julian, ‚Äúit can't be! That makes no sense. None. Anyway, salt water lakes are a thing, right?‚Äù

While the two of them argued, and Austin dug around in the sand with his index finger, I stood and stared. Muttering under my breath, almost to myself, I said ‚Äústrange how the road just‚Ä¶ stops.‚Äù

It was some time before we saw it. Julian had gone back onto the RV, but the rest of us refused to move on. Jason, Austin and I wanted to explore the beach further and, eventually, enticed Julian out. The four of us made our way down the strip that ran parallel to the treeline. The beach was populated by the occasional shell, smooth stone or hunk of driftwood. Just after I took Jason's picture, and we decided to head back, a small blur appeared on the ocean‚Äôs rim. Austin spotted it first, and we all stopped to look. The blur reflected the sunlight at odd angles, and looked to be drawing nearer. It wasn't that long before we came to the sudden and mutual understanding that it was a boat. 

The boat, which we were now following intently, was coming to shore, and strafing to the right as it did. Our little group kept pace with it, walking what felt like the entire length of the beach. Soon, the boat was near enough to make out the individual ropes and pulleys. I'd only ever been sailing once, and was far from familiar with any nautical terminologies, so pardon me if I make any mistakes. 

As we turned a bend in the shoreline we came across a rickety looking wooden pier that continued out maybe twenty yards into the sea. The white paint that covered the panels had all but flaked off, and the many posts were covered in old rope. Despite Jason's enthusiasm, we didn't walk onto the pier until we saw the sailing boat drift elegantly and stop at the end of the dock. Before any of us could say anything, Jason clambered onto the pier and strutted towards the now still ship. 

First, we called out to anyone who might be in the boat. When we got no reply back, we decided it was safe to explore. Jason was the first on as he eagerly climbed over the ship's railing and onto the deck. Once we made sure that the boat was tied securely to the dock with the thickest length of rope I'd ever seen, we followed him in on. The ship was a medium sized sailboat, clearly abandoned and left to drift. Still, it wasn't in that bad of a condition. The rigging seemed to be intact and the wooden floor seemed subject to only minor weathering. While me and Austin were snooping around the top deck, we heard Julian call us from down below. 

We passed down the hatch way and into the cramped lounge and sleeping quarters. Julian and Jason were slouched over the table, on which was a plate of half eaten roast chicken and steamed greens, next to a lukewarm cup of coffee. 

‚ÄúThis is so weird!‚Äô Mumbled Jason to himself, with a tone of wonder and amazement. 

‚ÄúRight, I'm going back to the RV‚Äù Julian said with a sigh and shrugged past us. 

Austin and I stood next to Jason, and prodded the food with the same shared amazement. Our moment was shattered by Julian's scream. We sounded like a wounded animal and the three of us rushed up to the top deck to see what had happened. As soon as I did, I stopped and looked around. There was no land anywhere in sight. None. I turned to my friends and saw the same terrifying realisation plastered on their faces. Surrounding us, from the boat to the horizon, was open water. 

‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we must've got loose‚Ä¶ drifted‚Äù Jason began to reason with himself. 

This was two weeks ago. The four of us have been drifting since. We've never seen land, felt hunger and we just can't settle on how long it's been. For me, at least, we've been drifting for two weeks. Austin commits to the idea that we've only been on the boat for a few hours, and still busies himself trying to find a way off. Maybe he's right, since my phone, the way I'm getting this message out to you all, still has plenty of juice. Jason sides with me, saying that we've only been here for a few weeks, a month tops. But Julian‚Ä¶ Julian now sits in the narrow corner of the cabin. He doesn't move, doesn't speak, but in his glassy eyes I can see the despair of years. 

Please. I have no idea how you can help us, but you must. You must. If you ever find the ocean where it shouldn't be, then you've found us. Please, come searching. You're our only hope.

Cats sleeping on windowsills. Couples being goofy and kind. Strangers doing nice things without a reason. It‚Äôs not just content‚Äîit‚Äôs the reminder that love like that exists. That people like me still make sense.

I‚Äôm 18. I‚Äôm someone who gives love like a storm‚Äîintense, consuming, loyal, and unapologetically tender. If I‚Äôm in, I‚Äôm all in. I‚Äôll flirt with you like I‚Äôve studied your smile for years. I‚Äôll check in on how your soul‚Äôs doing, not just your day. I‚Äôll remember the small things, even when you forget them yourself. I love deeply, and I love deliberately.

I‚Äôm not here for casual. I‚Äôm not here for games. I‚Äôm here because I still believe that two people can build something real‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs messy, slow-burning, wildly romantic, and a little exhausting in all the best ways.

When I‚Äôm not working toward my dream of becoming a robotics scientist, I‚Äôm usually learning something new, vibing to songs (Linkin Park or Radiohead when the emotions hit), or cooking‚Äîbecause food and love have one thing in common: effort.

I love people who are kind for no reason. I get attached to souls more than bodies. I don‚Äôt care about your looks. I care about your character. About whether you'd help a lost dog or remember your friend‚Äôs weird coffee order. I'm agnostic, but I respect people who have faith‚Äîany faith‚Äîas long as they respect others too.

I‚Äôm not perfect. I feel a lot. I think too much. I love in ways that scare me sometimes. But if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs been waiting to be truly seen, truly chosen, truly held‚Äînot just physically, but emotionally and spiritually‚ÄîI might just be your kind of person.
Say hi‚Äîsure. But say more than that.
If I poured a piece of my soul into this, I hope you can spare a little of yours too.
Tell me what part of this resonated. Or tell me who you are. Tell me what makes you feel like you still deserve love that doesn‚Äôt flinch. I‚Äôll be reading every word.

And if you‚Äôve made it this far‚Äîmaybe you‚Äôre the kind of person who sees love the way I do.
Not something to fall into, but something to build. Not just sparks, but steady warmth.

So don‚Äôt just message me. Match me. Match this effort.

Show me you're not just passing by‚Äîshow me you were meant to find this.

Taking our dog, Theo, on walks together each evening to the pier to watch the sailboats pass by. Sophia frequently tried convincing me. ‚ÄúOne of these days, we have to learn how to sail,‚Äù she‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúMaybe you forgot why they call this section of the ocean the red triangle,‚Äù I‚Äôd respond snarkily.¬†



She was always the adventurous one.



We‚Äôd grab lattes from our local coffee shop, just a short walk down the street from Harbor Drive, where we lived. We swooned over the scent of espresso mixing with steamed milk and the sweetness of reduced sugar in the cup.



When available, we‚Äôd snag our favorite table nestled into the bay window, overlooking the water. We‚Äôd sip and watch pedestrians pass by while making up stories about their conversations to see who could get the other person to laugh first. This was also the exact spot and theme of our first date.



These memories used to be sweet and warm reminders of the foundation of our relationship. Now weeks after she disappeared, it felt more like an invasion leaving me feeling empty and alone. Flooding over me in waves, attacking me unannounced and uninvited, like a ghost haunting me. How could she have left without saying goodbye?



No text. No phone call. Her clothes were still neatly folded in the dresser and hanging in the closet. Even her toothbrush was left in the bathroom.¬†



She just *vanished*.¬†



It was mid-July when I received *the* phone call. It was the detective. He had a solemn tone in his voice. Shit.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no easy way to say this. We‚Ä¶ um, found Sophia.‚Äù He paused, the air still, my heart pounding.¬†



‚ÄúShe was just a few yards off the entrance of Muir Woods. A hiker called it in just this morning. We‚Äôd like you to come by and positively identify her body.‚Äù



Her *body.*



I dropped the phone, sending it crashing to the kitchen floor, and broke down crying.



A few hours later I met the detective at the morgue. He led me to a cold room with blinding fluorescent lights. There in the center of the space was a gurney covered with a white sheet and a body underneath. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. He pulled the sheet back exposing her face.



With tears streaming down my face, I acknowledged, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Sophia‚Äù¬†



The detective led me to another room just down the hall. As we sat down he opened a folder revealing a few pictures captured at the scene.



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a bit‚Ä¶ graphic,‚Äù he warned as he handed them over.



Sofia was tied to a large redwood tree, her clothes removed exposing her body. Her feet and hands were bound. Dirt and dried blood under her cracked nails. Signs of a struggle.



Her face was covered by a mask crafted from a wolf‚Äôs head with jet-black fur. Its mouth gaping open showing rows of jagged teeth. A strange, cryptic symbol had been carved into her chest with some kind of sharp object. Blood had streamed down her torso and legs from the wound, pooling below her feet.¬†



I wish I hadn‚Äôt looked at the photos. *Why* the hell did I look at the damn photos!?



‚ÄúThis has all the signs of occult activity,‚Äù the detective stated.¬†



I sat speechless, bringing my hands to my face, and started to cry, the images of Sophia‚Äôs mutilated body fed to the forest burned into my mind.



‚Ä¢‚Ä¢



The first time I heard it was a year ago‚Ä¶ the ***whispering***\*.\*¬†



It was the end of September, a year after Sophia‚Äôs body was found in Muir Woods. I‚Äôd made the move to Chicago. A fresh start away from the routines and familiar surroundings that constantly stirred up painful memories.¬†



The first cold front of the season was moving in so the wind off the lake was sure to bite. I‚Äôd better dress warmly for the walk.¬†



I grabbed my favorite hoodie before heading out the door. It‚Äôs Thursday night which means takeout from Silver Spoon Thai and I wasn‚Äôt about to let the weather get between me and Pad See Ew.



‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back in a bit!‚Äù I exclaimed to Theo, who wagged his tail, a sign I take as understanding.



It was starting to get dark earlier these days, but I had a good hour before darkness consumed the park. Plenty of time.¬†



As I made my way down the hallway, rounding the corner, a sign posted to the elevator reading, ‚ÄúOut of order.‚Äù



‚ÄúUghhh,‚Äù I muttered with a deep sigh, surprised having said it out loud. It‚Äôs down five flights of stairs again tonight. Fine, I needed to clear my head after a long day anyhow. Not to mention, Thai food would be worth the extra effort.



I made my way to the entrance of Olive Park, one of my favorite spots in the city and the quickest way to the restaurant. The park was just a ten-minute walk from the front door, a key selling point for moving into the building, and a specific request from Theo, who loved a nearby green space.¬†



The park's paths are lined with dimly lit lamp posts and surrounded by massive oak trees creating a canopy over the walkway on three sides, quarantining the park from the city, just steps away. The remaining side, an abandoned water treatment plant that‚Äôs been out of commission for decades nestled between the park and the lake.



I move beyond the first section of trees toward the water treatment plant. There was a heaviness to the air tonight. The kind that made you look twice at all the shadows dancing in the distance through the darkness of the woods. The ever-present feeling of someone, no‚Ä¶ *something* watching you from the shadows.¬†



From just beyond the tree line, a sharp crack of a branch captured my attention.¬†



***Crack!!***



That‚Äôs when I heard it\*.\* An almost unnatural raspy sound coming from the woods. A long, drawn-out *whisper.*¬†



*‚ÄúaAaAaH-hhLll-lll‚Äù*



I stopped abruptly, startled, holding my breath, and scanned the surroundings. What the hell was that?



I looked around to see if the sound might be coming from a nearby park-goer. A friend playing some cruel prank, a*nyone.* But there was no one within 50 yards of me, just the ominous thicket of trees, the flickering of the street lamps above, and the decrepit water treatment building towering above the trees.¬†



‚ÄúHello!?‚Äù I asked nervously, unsure I wanted to hear a response.



*Nothing.*¬†



The hair on the back of my neck immediately electrified, defying gravity, standing on edge. Something felt off. Something felt‚Ä¶ *wrong.*¬†



Breathe in, breathe out.



The wind picked up from the inbound storm which was predicted to engulf the city later tonight. The ancient oak trees‚Äô branches extended like long twisted fingers, grasping at me from the gusts of wind angrily howling through the thicket, threatening to swallow me whole.



‚ÄúJust my imagination,‚Äù I said, attempting to shake the sense of dread and convince myself that everything was okay, a feeble attempt to calm my nerves and stay focused.¬†



I picked up the pace through the remainder of the park, careful to not look back, finally arriving at Silver Spoon.



‚ÄúHey, Dhalia. Good to see you.‚Äù I‚Äôd frequented Silver Spoon enough that we were on a first-name basis.



‚ÄúOh, hey,‚Äù an unusually short, tense response. I must have looked uneasy because Anong gave me a strange glance.



‚ÄúEverything okay? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù¬†



What was I going to tell her? That I‚Äôm freaking out because I heard whispering from the woods but no one was there? That I felt something *watching* me?



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I anxiously responded, ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù¬†



Not convincing.¬†



‚ÄúJust trying to get home before dark or it starts raining. Not sure which is worse,‚Äù¬† I stated with a slightly uncomfortable, nervous laugh. In truth, I wanted to get home as quickly as possible, open a bottle of wine, devour my Thai food, and forget that haunting whisper in the park ever happened.¬†



I grabbed my food, held out my phone to pay, added a generous tip, and headed out the door. ‚ÄúSee ya next week, Anong.‚Äù



I began the walk back with my to-go bag in hand. Careful this time to avoid the park and instead take the waterfront home with a renewed sense of purpose. It wasn‚Äôt quite as fast as the direct route through the park, but there was no way I was going back the way I came.¬†



Not after hearing that *voice*.



I passed Oak Street Beach making my way to the opposite side of the water treatment plant. I nearly reached the end of the park off the waterfront, almost home. I must have lost track of time because now the trees had fully devoured the remaining daylight, the sun swallowed by the horizon. It was impossibly dark now and raindrops had begun to fall.¬†



Abruptly, I started to feel that heaviness again. An ominous presence, like someone just out of sight was watching me. No‚Ä¶ *stalking me*.¬†



My nerves were again electric, sending warning signals to my brain like wildfire. Again I heard a branch crack loudly just off the path near the edge of the woods.



*Crack. Craack!*



I looked toward the sound of branches snapping, my eyes finding the only dead tree in the copse when I saw it. The same symbol that had been carved into Sophia‚Äôs chest was carved deeply into the trunk of this tree.¬†



A wave of dread came over me as my heart began to race. Suddenly, I heard the same whisper, this time more pronounced, louder, *sharper*.



*‚ÄúaaHhHhhA-aaaLLii-iIAaa‚Äù*



I froze in place. I felt my blood pressure spike as adrenaline coursed through my body. My nerves again electrified as the color drained from my face.



No. No. No. Not *again*.



My heart was pounding now, trying to escape my chest. *Escape.* That‚Äôs precisely what I needed to do‚Ä¶ *run.*



‚Ä¢‚Ä¢



For the next week, I tried to make sense of what happened that night. I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep, self-medicating with a couple of glasses of wine each night to calm my nerves. I couldn‚Äôt get the whispers, the symbols carved into Sophia‚Äôs chest, and the dead oak out of my mind.¬†



One thing was certain: I sure as hell wasn't going back to that park anytime soon.



That Friday night, after tipping back my third glass of red, I was ready to call it a night. I crawled into bed after washing my face and brushing my teeth. I was tossing and turning, trying to find a way to get comfortable.¬†



I‚Äôd finally dozed off when I was abruptly jolted awake by a loud, sharp noise.



I scanned the darkness. The room was cold, heavy\*‚Ä¶ ominous\*. My heart was racing and I immediately felt uneasy, as though someone‚Ä¶ no, *something* was in the room with me.



Crack. *Crack*. ***Craaack***\*!\*¬†



Suddenly, I see something move abruptly, unnaturally in the left corner of the ceiling.



My eyes began to adjust to the pitch black. The shadowy figure stared directly at me with milky white-filled eyes, clinging to the ceiling just feet away, inching closer with unnatural movements. I could see its jet-black hair falling toward the floor. Its mouth gaping open, displaying its needle-sharp, thin, gnashing teeth, *shrieking my name.*



***‚ÄúDHHALIIIAAAAAAA!!!!‚Äù***



I screamed in terror as it continued advancing toward me. My eyes having fully adjusted to the darkness, I could now clearly see the shadowy figure was wearing a mask: *Sophia‚Äôs face*.",4,1744586607.0,nosleep,0,0.83,False

I (37M) and my husband (39M) have been together 11 years. My husband owns a small bookshop and recently has hired a boy to help him. This lad (I'll call him Joe) is gay and while me and my husband very obviously have no issue with this, Joe seems to do things a lot differently to us. For context both me and my husband are Irish immigrants to London. We grew up a 20 minutes away from each other and went to the same, very Catholic, school. We aren't exactly flamboyant or outwardly 'gay' and don't exactly do PDA since that's how we were raised. On my lunch break from work I like to visit my husband bringing him records I think he might like and his coffee. Recently however Joe has started making comments. It started small with him saying things about'queer joy' and how he loves gay couples which we didn't mind at all, in all fairness it's a fairly scary world for queer people right now and I understand seeing a happy married gay couple means a lot for a kid. But then he started getting a little too comfortable for my liking. He started asking things like 'whose the top' and calling us the f slur jokingly. I think it's entirely inappropriate to be making those comments to his boss but my husband told me to let it go. Joe calls us the f slur a lot which I had brought up a few times telling him calmly to not do that but when he continued I learnt to let go despite my distaste for it since it didnt seem to bother my husband too much but last Wednesday I lost it. 
I was up by the counter when Joe came in. He immediately started blathering on about how f---y we are and while my husband chuckled awkwardly,I did not. Joe noticed this and said I was a stick in the mud and repressed. I was trying to keep my cool until he called me 'a fenian f---t' and I lost it. For anyone who doesn't know the term 'Fenian' isnt exactly a slur or anything but it isn't exactly nice either. Me and my husband jokingly call each other fenians or paddy's from time to time if weve something particularly 'Irish' and I've never exactly viewed as a very offensive word to me but something about this English boy made me snap. I asked him if he thought that was an appropriate thing to say to his boss's partner and started shouting. Telling him hes way out of play and if he wants to keep his job he should buck up. I left to cool down a bit and 30 minutes later got a call from my husband berating me saying that Joe was crying and that hes just a kid. I do feel really bad since hes only young but I still think he needed to be knocked down a step or two, am I the asshole?

Edit: I see a lot of people making comments about the nature of the relationship between Joe and my husband, my husband has asked Joe to stop on my behalf before but this isn't something that really bothers my husband and to be fair it's his workplace not mine. Joe also doesn't say these kinds of things to customers that I'm aware of",609,1744586124.0,AmItheAsshole,222,0.91,False

What sorts of questions to ask?,"Hi! I asked out this really cool girl who I'm sorts friends with last week, and she said yes! We went on our first date yesterday, and we're going out again tomorrow for our second date. Going to get coffee for this one. We're in a couple clubs at our college together. I know she's a really hard worker with solid career aspirations. Super smart too. Very fun to hang out with, and super cute :)

First date went really well! She said yes to a second one with no hesitation. Only thing tho, I'm wondering how to get to know her better at this stage. As in, thinking of questions to ask about her. I know a little about her already, and of course there's more to know in geberal terms. But I genuinely like her and would like a serious relationship, so I want to get a better feel of how she is/her goals/beliefs/etc. I know she wants to run for a local office someday. Normally, I wouldn't talk about politics on a second date, but considering she plans for law school and someday perhaps public office, do you think this might be a fair question? Also, other stuff too about what she's looking for relationship-wise...

And of course, I'll try to mix this in with fun questions and stories and avoid making it like an interview haha. I want to hit the right balance between showing genuine interest in getting to know her as a person and having fun too. Plus we only have 3 weeks left of the semester left, and I really like her so I'm worried about the summer distance (a little over an hour).

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Do you know how to tell when your favorite influencer is struggling?¬† It‚Äôs when they show up and beg you to save, like, and share their post and then they want you to follow 35 other desperate influencers‚Äô accounts and also would you mind tagging them in your story and in every comment going forward and if you do all of this‚Ä¶. You have a slight chance in hell of winning a trip to Disney and some WalMart luggage.¬† Guess who did exactly that this week?¬† Carlin.¬† The entire Stewart family screaming, jumping and clapping in a scam ad seems exactly like what one would expect from this family these days.¬† Of course one of the 95 rules is that you must SAVE her reel that features her children.¬† She is begging the public to exploit her children.¬† It‚Äôs a long week at home for the Stewarts and that means Carlin takes her viewers along to a dentist appointment.¬† She uses AI to tell us how she used to love the dentist, but now hates going.¬† Thanks for the news flash, but it‚Äôs Layla in the chair‚Ä¶ not you.¬† Anyway, Layla has a loose tooth so Carlin fake cries about it and then teases something exciting coming to the BSB.¬† It‚Äôs probably the mommy and me dresses, but maybe they are going to start selling only made in America products.¬† Michael better rev up the sewing machine. Back at the home studio, Evan sprawls out on the floor and acts like a baby so that Layla and Zade can care for him and Carlin can film it all.¬† Evan has to do exactly zero acting in his role as an infant.¬† Carlin heads upstairs to hawk her bra and panties combo again.¬† It‚Äôs the same unworn set she showed us last week, and it‚Äôs the only set she has.¬† Carlin has discovered pilates, about ten years after the Kardashians, and we get daily shots of her washed down in sweat, and then spraying her hair with dry shampoo.¬† You know she smells worse than the bottom of a middle school boy‚Äôs hamper.¬† Wash your damn hair, woman.¬† She is desperately linking everything these days, and dresses Layla up for a ‚Äúfit check‚Äù filming session.¬† Layla plays to the camera with hands on her hips, twisting and turning just how mom has taught her.¬† She tells us that daddy picked her outfit.  Friday is Carlin‚Äôs birthday and to celebrate Layla wakes her up for breakfast prepared by Evan.¬† How is she filming herself waking up?¬† Evan the Mensa member serves melted butter in a spoon rest and then gifts Carlin with 2 pair of $250 sunglasses.¬† Carlin has a grid post all about her 27th birthday.¬† It features just one group shot with Zade, but several of Layla with Carlin.¬† Carlin spends the day reposting all of her birthday wishes and the gifts she received.¬† Katie, Alyssa and Kelly Joe all send Instagram crap, Warden had Starbucks delivered and Joy Anna calls Carlin her best friend.¬† Evan posts a long AI tribute calling her the glue that holds them all together.¬† Carlin and Evan are forced to attend the Cash and Carry event at the Boutique where Carlin walks around holding her tummy and drinking a plastic take out container full of blue lemonade.¬† She is excited to tell us that Sophie Hill is also pregnant, so expect lots of cross over cringe.¬† The vlog is almost 2 weeks old and features the family in Nashville for Zade‚Äôs birthday celebration.¬† Evan takes a time out to shill a weight loss app and tells us he has lost 13 pounds in 4 months.¬† Zade is gifted toy tools and Evan beats everyone to the joke by saying he can use them to help Uncle Warden around the house.¬† We see Carlin and Katie getting their colors done because Carlin says it is what all of the cool people are doing.¬† She‚Äôs a Winter and Katie is a Summer.¬† Katie doesn‚Äôt seem convinced and plans to continue living that beige life. We see Layla in her swimsuit and Zade shirtless at swim lessons.¬† They both seem to be fighting the water and at times‚Ä¶ the YMCA instructor, so I hope Carlin signed them up for longer than a month.¬† We get an inside look at Layla‚Äôs sistermom training as Evan refuses to put down the camera to help his children, so Layla has to fold her towel and Zade‚Äôs before lessons.¬† No subtitles this week for the kids, so good luck figuring out exactly what they are talking about.¬† Finally Carlin and Evan squeeze into a small chair to talk about‚Ä¶ pregnancy. She‚Äôs 17 weeks along, so what the hell could they possibly have to say?¬† Plenty it turns out and they both drone on and on for at least 10 minutes.¬† While they are talking, you can see the lawn care dude working away out of the French doors.¬† Carlin slips and says she felt ‚Äúhim‚Äù kick and that isn‚Äôt the first time they have said that‚Ä¶. Still they insist she doesn‚Äôt know the gender and say they always find out at the 20 week ultrasound.¬† That seems too dated to be true, but whatever.¬† The big news here is that Evan is checked out of this entire thing.¬† He can‚Äôt even make a gender guess bc he flat out says he hasn‚Äôt been paying attention.¬† He says he has no clue when her sickness stopped, or what she is craving.¬† He is very busy practicing for his church‚Äôs Easter play.¬† Carlin keeps saying it‚Äôs been SO incredibly long since she was pregnant‚Ä¶and then her 3 year old toddles in.¬† She brags about how mature both kids are and then Zade grabs the microphone to tell us ‚Äúme wah doe dim‚Äù (he wants to swim).¬† Carlin giggles and speaks in baby talk while explaining what Zade is saying to Evan, and please God let this child still be going to speech. We learn that Evan has the starring role in the new cult church‚Äôs Easter play and both Kelly and Carlin post about his amazing performance.¬† Layla can be heard in the background wondering out loud if that is her dad.¬† It‚Äôs no surprise that Evan has the lead role‚Ä¶ they are the pastor‚Äôs favorite influencers.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Did anyone believe Katie Clark when she said they would be heading out on a Disney cruise and would be unplugging so they could truly be on vacation?¬† That may be what Katie wanted‚Ä¶ but Travis runs this show, and he had other plans.¬† Katie posts to Instagram saying they are halfway through their trip and she is sick as a dog.¬† She must be regretting her choice of a 7 day cruise and the $12,000+ they probably paid for it.¬† We see baby Harvey shirtless and Travis dancing around looking like a mom at drop off in his jeans, flip flops and backpack with his flowy shirt flapping in the breeze.¬† Katie posts for Carlin‚Äôs birthday calling her the best big sister and saying she is so sad not to be there to celebrate.¬† Hailey wasn‚Äôt on vacation either and is featured working away in a reel meeting Minnie Mouse.¬† Travis films while other families stand around in the background looking on in awe of his whole camera, lighting, microphone set up.¬† We see Hailey in another reel meeting Daisy Duck and she is one hyper toddler, running all over the ship and screaming laughing.¬† Just what dad wants and expects for his content.¬† Hailey is a fast learner.¬† Later, we see Travis and Katie alone on the upper deck watching the sunset.¬† He pans all around and‚Ä¶¬† Where were the kids?¬† In the weekly vlog, Travis tells us they are sharing a day in the life as they start their cruise.¬† He says they hungout with Alyssa and enjoyed getting caught up‚Ä¶ it had been FOUR years since they were last at Alyssa‚Äôs house.¬† We see them board the cruise, and get settled in their room.¬† Katie chose an inside stateroom bc the balcony scared her.¬† The room is tinier than she expected, and she is immediately seasick.¬† Travis is none too pleased with this news.¬† He is speechless and then keeps asking her over and over if she is kidding. I wonder if when Katie was getting her colors done they took into consideration this shade of sick, because girlfriend is white as a ghost while also being green.¬† She barely looked out at the water and the ship hadn‚Äôt even left port, so we know she is in for one hell of a ride.¬† We see Hailey eat macaroni 2x in one day, and then bounce all over the beds in the same shoes that she ran all over the ship with all day.¬† Katie wraps up her Florida content by sharing pictures of a visit with Erin.¬† She puts up a poll asking if the 2 sisters look alike.¬† She also shares pictures of Harvey and Hailey with Erin‚Äôs kids.¬† I wonder if Katie will buy Erin a farm.¬† That may be the final link to heal whatever the rift was between these 2.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Alyssa Webster spent the week coming down from her Trump induced high.¬† She was so distracted by the QAnon Queens that she forgot to link her phone cases in her latest ad.¬† Can‚Äôt collect that 6 cents if you don‚Äôt link Alyssa!¬† She is super proud to show Ellie sitting with her in a coffee shop.¬† Did Ellie come down to help Allie care for the kids while Alyssa was off playing Stepford Wife in DC?¬† Ellie‚Äôs payment was having her face filtered right along with Alyssa.¬† Hope you like the cartoon version of yourself El.¬† Allie Webster turned 10 years old on Friday, and in fundie world that is more than halfway to marriage and independence.¬† Alyssa‚Äôs birthday message spoke about how proud she is to watch Allie lead and love her siblings.¬† She says that Allie challenges her‚Ä¶ which is an interesting comment‚Ä¶ and that Allie has loved her through her ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù.¬† Is that code word for cold and unemotional? To celebrate double digits, Allie gets to pose with her mom outside of the coffee shop.¬† Mom shows off her humongous coffee drink, and Allie plasters on her fake grin as she holds her very own small drink.¬† They head off to BuildABear Workshop so Allie can make a stuffed bear.¬† Ellie is along for the ride.¬† Allie seems a bit old to appreciate this experience, but since she suffered through everyone else except her getting a bear last month, she winces her way through the process.¬† Alyssa once again forces her kids to line up in an interrogation line for her pictures.¬† Rhett continues to look miserable and Zoey and Maci are forced to wear those heavy clodhopping clown boots, even with short shorts.¬† Back at home Alyssa puts a full face of makeup on Allie and prepares her for the creepy date with dad.¬† John matches Allie‚Äôs dress, and they both stand stiff as boards so Alyssa can take pictures of it all.¬† Carlin gifts Allie with a trip to the nail salon for her birthday gift and Alyssa shows off both of their feet.¬† Carlin‚Äôs gift earns her a coveted tag from Alyssa, who barely shares any Bates these days.¬† We also see pictures from what appears to be a family birthday celebration for Allie.¬† The girls fixed the table as best as they could, and Allie poses with a cake covered in plastic flowers that she probably made herself.¬† Alyssa should remember how much money she has made off of Allie content through the years.¬† The oldest Bates granddaughter deserves so much more.¬† Kelly Jo does post to her grid and her stories wishing Allie a wonderful day.¬† She manages to keep the passive aggression to a minimum and only says that she notices all of the wonderful things Allie does for her siblings.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lydia Bates turns her 3d Oychersound into a reel for IG before heading off on a mid-week ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs weekend‚Äù.¬† She gets her hair and nails done, and waves goodbye to Trace and baby Ryker.¬† Lydia is in Indian Rocks, Florida at a rental house for her mom get away and it is‚Ä¶ silent.¬† Like absolutely NO noise.¬† I wonder if she is there alone, until she finally shares a picture with 2 other women that have never been shown on her account before.¬† All of Lydia‚Äôs content is alone.¬† She has a silent breakfast, and walks on the beach all by herself. She has a maternity shoot on the beach in a bright pink dress.¬† Nathan comments on her pictures saying this was his and Esther‚Äôs favorite beach.¬† By Thursday, Lydia is back at home to celebrate her birthday with Trace.¬† They obviously traded out the beach house for ads, because once she is home, she links the entire vacation.¬† Lydia turns 27 and Trace figured out AI and used it to post a flowery tribute to Lydia that earns him compliments from followers who believe he wrote this himself.¬† Kelly Jo really lays it on thick in Lydia‚Äôs birthday post.¬† Says she is always there for her, loves her dearly, and calls her a friend‚Ä¶ not her BEST friend‚Ä¶ but a friend none the less.¬† It isn‚Äôt lost on anyone that everything KJ mentions is things Lydia does FOR her.¬† Trace clocks in to sell the same bee pollen pills that Alyssa is always hawking, and the weekly vlog is sponsored by the frozen bread everyone else sells. Trace would like you to buy a SUScrision (subscription) for this bread by using the link in the scrition (description??) While Trace talks to his phone, baby Ryker is in his high chair watching an ad featuring Trace and Lydia for those fancy chairs.¬† It‚Äôs a real Meta moment.¬† Trace is excited bc he has ordered Lydia a maternity dress for her birthday.¬† The vlog cuts back and forth between Trace and Ryker at home and Lydia on her monk style vacation.¬† Trace brags that he kept Ryker all alone the entire time Lydia was gone‚Ä¶ then later admits he went to her mom‚Äôs twice, and visited Carlin and other family members.¬† Anyway, the dress shows up and it‚Äôs a deep greenish blue and Lydia loves it.¬† She pairs it with white heels that Trace says make him feel short, and wears the whole thing out to Ruth‚Äôs Chris for dinner.¬† He also gifted her Birkenstocks and a fancy drill.¬† She loves the drill bc she is the one who builds everything when Warden isn‚Äôt available.¬† Trace keeps saying he really listens to Lydia so he knew what she wanted, and she sheepishly grins a lot.¬† Unlike Carlin, she didn‚Äôt get a ton of IG birthday wishes, but the commenters say the 2 of them are down to earth and haven‚Äôt gotten crazy materialistic.¬† I mean‚Ä¶ if they could‚Ä¶ they certainly would‚Ä¶

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Erin Paine wants you to know that her man does work.¬† He does not spend all day following her around with an iphone‚Ä¶ some days he gets lucky and is asked to brick in a grill for folks.¬† Erin shows off Chad‚Äôs handiwork on Instagram and says how proud she is of him.¬† The ‚Äúoutdoor kitchen‚Äù looks like an HGTV disaster, but if he got paid‚Ä¶ more power to him.¬† She also shows us baby William playing in the dirt and says he is such a boy.¬† Because dirt equals male in her mind.¬† In a new vlog, Erin shows off the latest rental and all of the furniture and belongings that can be quickly ripped out and taken with them whenever their lease is up/they are asked to leave.¬† This tour is totally silent even though the kids are inside.¬† Chad is filming the entire thing on her iphone, and she is wearing a microphone.¬† Carles and the baby share a room and it appears the baby sleeps in a wooden box.¬† Erin busts into Carles private things to show off the hundreds of tiny paper characters he has drawn and colored.¬† She calls them paper dolls, and many of them are wearing colorful princess dresses that Erin says the girls ask him to make.¬† They set up scenes and create worlds for these drawings‚Ä¶ something is sort of sad about this version of escapism.¬† She does say he is starting art classes very soon, and why do I feel like they will be with Brandon Keilen via zoom?¬† All 4 girls are packed in one room.¬† They sleep in a triple bunk bed and the youngest sleeps on what appears to be a dog bed on the floor.¬† Erin has an entire bedroom full of crap that she refuses to turn into another room for the girls because‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ they are JUST girls.¬† At the end of the vlog, Erin uses a word we haven‚Äôt heard since Duggar days.¬† She explains that her children help with the upkeep of the home by taking care of their JURISDICTIONS.¬† *shudder*¬† Is this a home‚Ä¶ or a work camp?¬† Erin reposts Katie‚Äôs post of their visit together, and shows that Ellie has been shipped over to her house now.¬† Where is Addee these days?¬† I thought those 2 were a package deal.
¬†



8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Michael Keilen was probably busy all week caring for the Balka kids, but she did find time to confuse the hell out of all of her followers by posting a picture with each one of her siblings and then sharing the amount of months between her and each of them.¬† SOTDRT strikes again, because shug was not exactly right with her calculations and if anyone was trying to follow along, she didn‚Äôt share her own birthdate.¬† Headache inducing.¬† She and Brandon do debut a new vlog where she is back in the kitchen.¬† Zach should take note bc with old pots and pans, a worn out electric range and a few tripods, she was able to make fried rice and chicken egg rolls in ten minutes.¬† Brandon knows his editing, and he used the time lapse feature to great advantage.¬† Michael preps everything ahead of time, and talks the viewer through the steps.¬† You could see Brandon‚Äôs tripod set up for the overhead shots, and everything was super clean.¬† The worst part of this is that there was only the slightest bit of seasoning‚Ä¶and she put frozen peas, carrots and corn in her fried rice.¬† All of that, plus canned stereotypical Asian style music featured in the background while Michael speaks with zero personality made this a hard watch.

1jykqbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1jykqbs/aer_day_sling_3_max_vs_alpaka_go_sling/,Aer Day Sling 3 Max vs Alpaka Go Sling,"Hi everyone, I recently got an 11‚Äù iPad and was after a nice EDC bag that can also handle my needs when travelling. I currently have the Bellroy Venture sling 9L, however, with the iPad inside, it isn‚Äôt able to hold much else and still be able to close comfortably. 

I‚Äôve been researching and am considering between the Aer Day Sling 3 max ($150AUD) and the Alpaka Go Sling ($130), both in x-pac. 

My EDC is typically:
- iPad 11‚Äù 
- Logitech K380s
- Ugreen 20k mah power bank
- Alpaka hub pouch
- B5-sized book
- A few pens (including a stylus)
- Chums surfshort wallet
- Keys
- Nothing ear open
- Occasionally an insulated coffee cup (Fellow Carter)

When travelling, I‚Äôm planning on carrying the same thing (minus the coffee cup) plus:
- Memobottle A6 (stainless)
- Sony XM4 headphones
- Osprey dry stuff pack (packable daypack)

Due to the bulky nature of some of my items when travelling, I‚Äôm thinking more toward the Aer but would really like to hear your opinions. If you have any other options, I am happy to hear them. 

Edit: I have heard about both bags having issues with the straps so any insight into that and the comfortability of the bags would be very much appreciated. ",1,1744585923.0,ManyBaggers,0,1.0,False
1jykqbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1jykqbi/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Do you know how to tell when your favorite influencer is struggling?¬† It‚Äôs when they show up and beg you to save, like, and share their post and then they want you to follow 35 other desperate influencers‚Äô accounts and also would you mind tagging them in your story and in every comment going forward and if you do all of this‚Ä¶. You have a slight chance in hell of winning a trip to Disney and some WalMart luggage.¬† Guess who did exactly that this week?¬† Carlin.¬† The entire Stewart family screaming, jumping and clapping in a scam ad seems exactly like what one would expect from this family these days.¬† Of course one of the 95 rules is that you must SAVE her reel that features her children.¬† She is begging the public to exploit her children.¬† It‚Äôs a long week at home for the Stewarts and that means Carlin takes her viewers along to a dentist appointment.¬† She uses AI to tell us how she used to love the dentist, but now hates going.¬† Thanks for the news flash, but it‚Äôs Layla in the chair‚Ä¶ not you.¬† Anyway, Layla has a loose tooth so Carlin fake cries about it and then teases something exciting coming to the BSB.¬† It‚Äôs probably the mommy and me dresses, but maybe they are going to start selling only made in America products.¬† Michael better rev up the sewing machine. Back at the home studio, Evan sprawls out on the floor and acts like a baby so that Layla and Zade can care for him and Carlin can film it all.¬† Evan has to do exactly zero acting in his role as an infant.¬† Carlin heads upstairs to hawk her bra and panties combo again.¬† It‚Äôs the same unworn set she showed us last week, and it‚Äôs the only set she has.¬† Carlin has discovered pilates, about ten years after the Kardashians, and we get daily shots of her washed down in sweat, and then spraying her hair with dry shampoo.¬† You know she smells worse than the bottom of a middle school boy‚Äôs hamper.¬† Wash your damn hair, woman.¬† She is desperately linking everything these days, and dresses Layla up for a ‚Äúfit check‚Äù filming session.¬† Layla plays to the camera with hands on her hips, twisting and turning just how mom has taught her.¬† She tells us that daddy picked her outfit.  Friday is Carlin‚Äôs birthday and to celebrate Layla wakes her up for breakfast prepared by Evan.¬† How is she filming herself waking up?¬† Evan the Mensa member serves melted butter in a spoon rest and then gifts Carlin with 2 pair of $250 sunglasses.¬† Carlin has a grid post all about her 27th birthday.¬† It features just one group shot with Zade, but several of Layla with Carlin.¬† Carlin spends the day reposting all of her birthday wishes and the gifts she received.¬† Katie, Alyssa and Kelly Joe all send Instagram crap, Warden had Starbucks delivered and Joy Anna calls Carlin her best friend.¬† Evan posts a long AI tribute calling her the glue that holds them all together.¬† Carlin and Evan are forced to attend the Cash and Carry event at the Boutique where Carlin walks around holding her tummy and drinking a plastic take out container full of blue lemonade.¬† She is excited to tell us that Sophie Hill is also pregnant, so expect lots of cross over cringe.¬† The vlog is almost 2 weeks old and features the family in Nashville for Zade‚Äôs birthday celebration.¬† Evan takes a time out to shill a weight loss app and tells us he has lost 13 pounds in 4 months.¬† Zade is gifted toy tools and Evan beats everyone to the joke by saying he can use them to help Uncle Warden around the house.¬† We see Carlin and Katie getting their colors done because Carlin says it is what all of the cool people are doing.¬† She‚Äôs a Winter and Katie is a Summer.¬† Katie doesn‚Äôt seem convinced and plans to continue living that beige life. We see Layla in her swimsuit and Zade shirtless at swim lessons.¬† They both seem to be fighting the water and at times‚Ä¶ the YMCA instructor, so I hope Carlin signed them up for longer than a month.¬† We get an inside look at Layla‚Äôs sistermom training as Evan refuses to put down the camera to help his children, so Layla has to fold her towel and Zade‚Äôs before lessons.¬† No subtitles this week for the kids, so good luck figuring out exactly what they are talking about.¬† Finally Carlin and Evan squeeze into a small chair to talk about‚Ä¶ pregnancy. She‚Äôs 17 weeks along, so what the hell could they possibly have to say?¬† Plenty it turns out and they both drone on and on for at least 10 minutes.¬† While they are talking, you can see the lawn care dude working away out of the French doors.¬† Carlin slips and says she felt ‚Äúhim‚Äù kick and that isn‚Äôt the first time they have said that‚Ä¶. Still they insist she doesn‚Äôt know the gender and say they always find out at the 20 week ultrasound.¬† That seems too dated to be true, but whatever.¬† The big news here is that Evan is checked out of this entire thing.¬† He can‚Äôt even make a gender guess bc he flat out says he hasn‚Äôt been paying attention.¬† He says he has no clue when her sickness stopped, or what she is craving.¬† He is very busy practicing for his church‚Äôs Easter play.¬† Carlin keeps saying it‚Äôs been SO incredibly long since she was pregnant‚Ä¶and then her 3 year old toddles in.¬† She brags about how mature both kids are and then Zade grabs the microphone to tell us ‚Äúme wah doe dim‚Äù (he wants to swim).¬† Carlin giggles and speaks in baby talk while explaining what Zade is saying to Evan, and please God let this child still be going to speech. We learn that Evan has the starring role in the new cult church‚Äôs Easter play and both Kelly and Carlin post about his amazing performance.¬† Layla can be heard in the background wondering out loud if that is her dad.¬† It‚Äôs no surprise that Evan has the lead role‚Ä¶ they are the pastor‚Äôs favorite influencers.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Did anyone believe Katie Clark when she said they would be heading out on a Disney cruise and would be unplugging so they could truly be on vacation?¬† That may be what Katie wanted‚Ä¶ but Travis runs this show, and he had other plans.¬† Katie posts to Instagram saying they are halfway through their trip and she is sick as a dog.¬† She must be regretting her choice of a 7 day cruise and the $12,000+ they probably paid for it.¬† We see baby Harvey shirtless and Travis dancing around looking like a mom at drop off in his jeans, flip flops and backpack with his flowy shirt flapping in the breeze.¬† Katie posts for Carlin‚Äôs birthday calling her the best big sister and saying she is so sad not to be there to celebrate.¬† Hailey wasn‚Äôt on vacation either and is featured working away in a reel meeting Minnie Mouse.¬† Travis films while other families stand around in the background looking on in awe of his whole camera, lighting, microphone set up.¬† We see Hailey in another reel meeting Daisy Duck and she is one hyper toddler, running all over the ship and screaming laughing.¬† Just what dad wants and expects for his content.¬† Hailey is a fast learner.¬† Later, we see Travis and Katie alone on the upper deck watching the sunset.¬† He pans all around and‚Ä¶¬† Where were the kids?¬† In the weekly vlog, Travis tells us they are sharing a day in the life as they start their cruise.¬† He says they hungout with Alyssa and enjoyed getting caught up‚Ä¶ it had been FOUR years since they were last at Alyssa‚Äôs house.¬† We see them board the cruise, and get settled in their room.¬† Katie chose an inside stateroom bc the balcony scared her.¬† The room is tinier than she expected, and she is immediately seasick.¬† Travis is none too pleased with this news.¬† He is speechless and then keeps asking her over and over if she is kidding. I wonder if when Katie was getting her colors done they took into consideration this shade of sick, because girlfriend is white as a ghost while also being green.¬† She barely looked out at the water and the ship hadn‚Äôt even left port, so we know she is in for one hell of a ride.¬† We see Hailey eat macaroni 2x in one day, and then bounce all over the beds in the same shoes that she ran all over the ship with all day.¬† Katie wraps up her Florida content by sharing pictures of a visit with Erin.¬† She puts up a poll asking if the 2 sisters look alike.¬† She also shares pictures of Harvey and Hailey with Erin‚Äôs kids.¬† I wonder if Katie will buy Erin a farm.¬† That may be the final link to heal whatever the rift was between these 2.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Josie Balka is on a content cruise this week.¬† Sure she said this was a trip to celebrate her friend Maribell‚Äôs birthday, but we all know this was a work trip, and Mrs. Balka was locked in.¬† Maribell was but a bit player in the madness.¬† Josie is shilling from the very beginning by sharing a mini vlog featuring a new travel bag link and all of the makeup she will be using.¬† Of course she walks through the airport with her hair wrapped in her pool noodle‚Ä¶ and of course we also see her a few hours later, with no pool noodle and straight hair.¬† I think at this point the pool noodle IS the look.¬† She debuts the first of many tight, low cut bodycon dresses while loving up on ole pigeon toed Ktron in his uncomfortably tight pants.¬† Josie shares a minivlog of Costa Maya where they booked a resort so they could eat, drink juice and take a nap.¬† Riveting.¬† She makes several grid posts during this trip, and then directs all of the commenters to her stories where she links everything.¬† She helps poor Maribell with her makeup and complains about her very small eyes.¬† Josie helping Maribell with makeup is Maribell‚Äôs payment for taking picture after picture of the Balkas pretending to be on Only Fans.¬† Maribell will need therapy after all she saw through that lens this week.¬† They rent mopeds to explore the next port stop and both of their husbands out kicked their coverage.¬† The moped helmet is doing Kelton no favors, but Josie is a great actress and continues to pretend he‚Äôs hot as hell.¬† In one of her grid posts, she labels them ‚Äúmom and dad‚Äù and talks about how much she loves to get dressed up for a cruise.¬† Kelton is in a button up with sneakers and no tie, but whatever you say Josie.¬† They eat in a fancy restaurant that pairs a different wine with each entr√©e, but Josie drowns her feed in Mexican Coke, mock mojitos and fresh squeezed mango juice.¬† Kelton tries a berry Dr. Pepper and pushes Josie to try it to.¬† Watching her avoid putting her lips on the can after him tells us all we need to know about how she actually feels.¬† Josie works this entire trip and features minivlog after minivlog and tons of GRWMs. Every outfit she wears is brand new and lots of her comments talk about another baby coming soon, and some ask how she can leave her kids for so long.¬† Back at home we see the girls hugging her while a camera tripod is in the corner‚Ä¶.ready for a closeup at any time.¬† After showing us baby Miles trying to walk, and throwing some Mexico gifts at the girls, Josie heads to her favorite hide out‚Ä¶ her room‚Ä¶ so that she can get to work selling makeup for Sephora.¬† Every other word is LITERALLY and she drops reels back to back where she refers to products as ‚Äúshe‚Äù and ‚Äúthat girl‚Äù.¬† Whew‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a lot.¬† Josie is working harder than ever, even though she supposedly is the wealthiest sibling.¬†

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Alyssa Webster spent the week coming down from her Trump induced high.¬† She was so distracted by the QAnon Queens that she forgot to link her phone cases in her latest ad.¬† Can‚Äôt collect that 6 cents if you don‚Äôt link Alyssa!¬† She is super proud to show Ellie sitting with her in a coffee shop.¬† Did Ellie come down to help Allie care for the kids while Alyssa was off playing Stepford Wife in DC?¬† Ellie‚Äôs payment was having her face filtered right along with Alyssa.¬† Hope you like the cartoon version of yourself El.¬† Allie Webster turned 10 years old on Friday, and in fundie world that is more than halfway to marriage and independence.¬† Alyssa‚Äôs birthday message spoke about how proud she is to watch Allie lead and love her siblings.¬† She says that Allie challenges her‚Ä¶ which is an interesting comment‚Ä¶ and that Allie has loved her through her ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù.¬† Is that code word for cold and unemotional? To celebrate double digits, Allie gets to pose with her mom outside of the coffee shop.¬† Mom shows off her humongous coffee drink, and Allie plasters on her fake grin as she holds her very own small drink.¬† They head off to BuildABear Workshop so Allie can make a stuffed bear.¬† Ellie is along for the ride.¬† Allie seems a bit old to appreciate this experience, but since she suffered through everyone else except her getting a bear last month, she winces her way through the process.¬† Alyssa once again forces her kids to line up in an interrogation line for her pictures.¬† Rhett continues to look miserable and Zoey and Maci are forced to wear those heavy clodhopping clown boots, even with short shorts.¬† Back at home Alyssa puts a full face of makeup on Allie and prepares her for the creepy date with dad.¬† John matches Allie‚Äôs dress, and they both stand stiff as boards so Alyssa can take pictures of it all.¬† Carlin gifts Allie with a trip to the nail salon for her birthday gift and Alyssa shows off both of their feet.¬† Carlin‚Äôs gift earns her a coveted tag from Alyssa, who barely shares any Bates these days.¬† We also see pictures from what appears to be a family birthday celebration for Allie.¬† The girls fixed the table as best as they could, and Allie poses with a cake covered in plastic flowers that she probably made herself.¬† Alyssa should remember how much money she has made off of Allie content through the years.¬† The oldest Bates granddaughter deserves so much more.¬† Kelly Jo does post to her grid and her stories wishing Allie a wonderful day.¬† She manages to keep the passive aggression to a minimum and only says that she notices all of the wonderful things Allie does for her siblings.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lydia Bates turns her 3d Oychersound into a reel for IG before heading off on a mid-week ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs weekend‚Äù.¬† She gets her hair and nails done, and waves goodbye to Trace and baby Ryker.¬† Lydia is in Indian Rocks, Florida at a rental house for her mom get away and it is‚Ä¶ silent.¬† Like absolutely NO noise.¬† I wonder if she is there alone, until she finally shares a picture with 2 other women that have never been shown on her account before.¬† All of Lydia‚Äôs content is alone.¬† She has a silent breakfast, and walks on the beach all by herself. She has a maternity shoot on the beach in a bright pink dress.¬† Nathan comments on her pictures saying this was his and Esther‚Äôs favorite beach.¬† By Thursday, Lydia is back at home to celebrate her birthday with Trace.¬† They obviously traded out the beach house for ads, because once she is home, she links the entire vacation.¬† Lydia turns 27 and Trace figured out AI and used it to post a flowery tribute to Lydia that earns him compliments from followers who believe he wrote this himself.¬† Kelly Jo really lays it on thick in Lydia‚Äôs birthday post.¬† Says she is always there for her, loves her dearly, and calls her a friend‚Ä¶ not her BEST friend‚Ä¶ but a friend none the less.¬† It isn‚Äôt lost on anyone that everything KJ mentions is things Lydia does FOR her.¬† Trace clocks in to sell the same bee pollen pills that Alyssa is always hawking, and the weekly vlog is sponsored by the frozen bread everyone else sells. Trace would like you to buy a SUScrision (subscription) for this bread by using the link in the scrition (description??) While Trace talks to his phone, baby Ryker is in his high chair watching an ad featuring Trace and Lydia for those fancy chairs.¬† It‚Äôs a real Meta moment.¬† Trace is excited bc he has ordered Lydia a maternity dress for her birthday.¬† The vlog cuts back and forth between Trace and Ryker at home and Lydia on her monk style vacation.¬† Trace brags that he kept Ryker all alone the entire time Lydia was gone‚Ä¶ then later admits he went to her mom‚Äôs twice, and visited Carlin and other family members.¬† Anyway, the dress shows up and it‚Äôs a deep greenish blue and Lydia loves it.¬† She pairs it with white heels that Trace says make him feel short, and wears the whole thing out to Ruth‚Äôs Chris for dinner.¬† He also gifted her Birkenstocks and a fancy drill.¬† She loves the drill bc she is the one who builds everything when Warden isn‚Äôt available.¬† Trace keeps saying he really listens to Lydia so he knew what she wanted, and she sheepishly grins a lot.¬† Unlike Carlin, she didn‚Äôt get a ton of IG birthday wishes, but the commenters say the 2 of them are down to earth and haven‚Äôt gotten crazy materialistic.¬† I mean‚Ä¶ if they could‚Ä¶ they certainly would‚Ä¶

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Zach Bates is happy to be an influencer dad.¬† It‚Äôs his favorite job yet, and he shows off a fishing trip with Brad and Kacie where they caught no fish, but (so he says) made tons of memories.¬† Zach films himself with Warden and asks for questions for an upcoming q and a.¬† I guess his latest plan for The Bates Kitchen is to feature each one of his siblings.¬† So far, Callie‚Äôs vlog has the most views.¬† In big news, Zach is gifted a brand new flat top grill by Traeger grills‚Ä¶ I wonder if Kelton is jealous.¬† Warden is with him and they say they are answering all of the questions that didn‚Äôt fit in the vlog on IG.¬† The biggest thing I get from this conversation is that Warden likes his eggs runny, and he comments on how tiny his arm is compared to Zach‚Äôs great big ole arm.¬† Zach is not amused.¬† Whitney goes big on her birthday posts to Carlin.¬† She calls her a constant in her life through a decade.¬† After telling us last week that she is still working on influencing on IG, Whitney was mostly absent this week, but does show up at the Cash and Carry to try and dump some dresses.¬† She films Sunday morning on the way to church telling us that they are late, and like all of the other Bates‚Ä¶films the family walking in to the service.¬† This week‚Äôs vlog is Whitney and Zach cooking a chicken casserole.¬† She fusses at him for pulling the mixing beaters out of their junk drawer and using them without first washing them.¬† If Whitney only knew‚Ä¶ on the list of gross things Zach has done in the kitchen‚Ä¶ this is so low.¬† (Remembering the FART)¬† Anyway, they shred unseasoned, boiled chicken, mix it with sour cream and soup, top it with crackers, and pretend it is heaven in their mouths.¬† Whitney is super relaxed on camera and comes across as carefree and happy.¬† If she is truly working less‚Ä¶ maybe she is.

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Erin Paine wants you to know that her man does work.¬† He does not spend all day following her around with an iphone‚Ä¶ some days he gets lucky and is asked to brick in a grill for folks.¬† Erin shows off Chad‚Äôs handiwork on Instagram and says how proud she is of him.¬† The ‚Äúoutdoor kitchen‚Äù looks like an HGTV disaster, but if he got paid‚Ä¶ more power to him.¬† She also shows us baby William playing in the dirt and says he is such a boy.¬† Because dirt equals male in her mind.¬† In a new vlog, Erin shows off the latest rental and all of the furniture and belongings that can be quickly ripped out and taken with them whenever their lease is up/they are asked to leave.¬† This tour is totally silent even though the kids are inside.¬† Chad is filming the entire thing on her iphone, and she is wearing a microphone.¬† Carles and the baby share a room and it appears the baby sleeps in a wooden box.¬† Erin busts into Carles private things to show off the hundreds of tiny paper characters he has drawn and colored.¬† She calls them paper dolls, and many of them are wearing colorful princess dresses that Erin says the girls ask him to make.¬† They set up scenes and create worlds for these drawings‚Ä¶ something is sort of sad about this version of escapism.¬† She does say he is starting art classes very soon, and why do I feel like they will be with Brandon Keilen via zoom?¬† All 4 girls are packed in one room.¬† They sleep in a triple bunk bed and the youngest sleeps on what appears to be a dog bed on the floor.¬† Erin has an entire bedroom full of crap that she refuses to turn into another room for the girls because‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ they are JUST girls.¬† At the end of the vlog, Erin uses a word we haven‚Äôt heard since Duggar days.¬† She explains that her children help with the upkeep of the home by taking care of their JURISDICTIONS.¬† *shudder*¬† Is this a home‚Ä¶ or a work camp?¬† Erin reposts Katie‚Äôs post of their visit together, and shows that Ellie has been shipped over to her house now.¬† Where is Addee these days?¬† I thought those 2 were a package deal.
¬†



8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Michael Keilen was probably busy all week caring for the Balka kids, but she did find time to confuse the hell out of all of her followers by posting a picture with each one of her siblings and then sharing the amount of months between her and each of them.¬† SOTDRT strikes again, because shug was not exactly right with her calculations and if anyone was trying to follow along, she didn‚Äôt share her own birthdate.¬† Headache inducing.¬† She and Brandon do debut a new vlog where she is back in the kitchen.¬† Zach should take note bc with old pots and pans, a worn out electric range and a few tripods, she was able to make fried rice and chicken egg rolls in ten minutes.¬† Brandon knows his editing, and he used the time lapse feature to great advantage.¬† Michael preps everything ahead of time, and talks the viewer through the steps.¬† You could see Brandon‚Äôs tripod set up for the overhead shots, and everything was super clean.¬† The worst part of this is that there was only the slightest bit of seasoning‚Ä¶and she put frozen peas, carrots and corn in her fried rice.¬† All of that, plus canned stereotypical Asian style music featured in the background while Michael speaks with zero personality made this a hard watch.

Our friendship was good but she also started work shortly after and I started grad school.


At first things were good and we‚Äôd hang out every so often- we did a variety of things too. For years things were fine.

Recently I feel a disconnect between the two of us. Last year or so we‚Äôd meet up on Fridays or something like that (sometimes biweekly, sometimes longer between) and we‚Äôd get dressed up and make a hangout of it. 


Recently when we meet she‚Äôs saying how she wishes she was with her coworkers or can‚Äôt wait to hang out with her friends, and asks me if I know how she can make friends in her adult life. She also talks about how I don‚Äôt look done up enough or we don‚Äôt look presentable- I spoke out and said I very much so put effort into how I look when we go. Recently told her I have to get bloodwork and she said ‚Äústop putting it off and being so scared, how will you handle life?‚Äù I never said I‚Äôm scared. There‚Äôs always these assumptions 

Example: I say I need to get my nails done and go shopping. She‚Äôll invite me to join her getting her nails or hair done if I mention how I wanna do that, but she‚Äôll only do something with me before or after her other meet up. I did not go after the first time because her coworker abruptly came at the end (not planned this time) and I was still getting my nails done, she said they wanna get coffee before shopping- both left. 


This time we texted about getting drinks. we met and she was dressed in sweatpants- which is fine but she said we both made no effort, when I tried to dress up and did my makeup to feel like I was doing something. She complained about having to be outside, called her fianc√©, and then texted her friends practically the whole time we were there. The next day she goes out with her work friends and is posting the whole thing. I‚Äôm not sure if I do something wrong but this pattern- where I feel like my friends only talk about being excited to go out with other friends- is always present.

I was in the hiring/clearance process for a support position with the FBI and finally got to the polygraph stage after several months. When I showed up for my poly, I was 15 min early. The examiner was pretty rude, seemed annoyed that I was there, and complained that  he wouldn't have his morning coffee since I was early, and throughout  the process left the room several times to get coffee. I gave nothing  but truthful answers and stayed still to the best of my ability. Meanwhile he got increasingly hostile, which eventually devolved into him batantly accusing me of 1) intentionally moving, 2) being a terrorist because I worked in eastern Europe as a medical contractor for two years, and 3) lying about ommiting info on my application because I had previously had a position cancelled in adjudication after poly with another IC agency (no explanation given in that letter) and ""that just doesn't happen"". He then proceeded to verbally berate and acuse me while taking in circles for about 15 minutes. Ultimately he told me he didn't actually think I was a terrorist but that I had failed the poly. He then said HQ would have final say and escorted me out. Time from arrival to leaving was about 35 min.  

A little over a month later I get a letter stating the my polygraph was ""not within acceptable parameters"" and my application was cancelled, it was not a denial of clearance, and that I could file a request for an appeal to have my test reexamined.

Days 1-3 were probably the hardest but I am still wanting caffeine everyday. It's like a devil on one shoulder pushing me to drink it and an angel on the other telling me not to. I decided to quit mainly due to high blood pressure because I'm also prescribed a stimulant for mental health reasons.

Today I feel like I just can't become alert. I feel way too chill. I went to a movie with a couple of friends and I don't feel like I really registered it. I was there watching it physically but mentally I was just numb. I started getting sleepy too. 

Am I still just trying to get back to baseline? I don't like the way this feels. While I feel better not having increased anxiety, I feel way less confident having slower thinking and reactions.",2,1744585358.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

not in a sad way‚Äîjust... quietly. it was peaceful. manageable. i‚Äôd always imagined it with soft music playing in the background, books stacked by the window, unfinished painting by the side, a warm cup of coffee in my hand, and the kind of silence that doesn‚Äôt ache.

i had made peace with solitude.

but then you came in.

not all at once, but slowly. like sunlight moving across a room. one day i just noticed that when i thought of the years ahead, you were there too‚Äîwithout forcing your way in, without making a sound. you just... appeared. and stayed.

suddenly, there were two mugs on the table.  
there was laughter in the kitchen.  
there was a second toothbrush by the sink.

you were in the playlists i‚Äôd play while cleaning, the scribbled grocery lists, the dinner plans after a long day. you were the reason i started thinking of sharing my life, not just living it.

i used to imagine nights of calm silence, and now i dream of soft conversations whispered before bed. of you showing me your art, and me watching, eyes full. of cuddles after a long day, of petty little fights and the making up that follows. of sitting across from you on rainy days, both of us reading in peace, feet touching beneath a blanket.

before, i thought a life alone was enough.  
and it still is.  
but a life with you?  
god, it feels like more\*.\*

i never knew i could want something this quietly, this deeply. but i do. i want to share my days with you. my thoughts, my meals, my slow mornings and tired nights. not because i need you to survive them‚Äîbut because everything feels warmer with you in them.

1jykiov,https://i.redd.it/7aztlx89noue1.jpeg,AMSW Internal Log: The Hot Terrabrew Incident," AMSW INTERNAL INCIDENT LOG

Classification: Routine Systems Safety Violation ‚Äì Archive Flag: Cultural Memorandum

Event Designation: The Hot Terrabrew Incident

Location: Anchor Orbital Staryards, Archimedes I

Date: \[Omitted pending inquiry resolution\]

Reporting Officer: M. Drayton, Systems Control Lead

Summary:

Scheduled gravity cycling during Routine Integration Cycle 14-B proceeded as expected‚Äîuntil it collided, figuratively and literally, with Intern Cal and three unrestrained cups of Terrabrew‚Ñ¢‚Äôs limited-run Molten Midnight Roast. What followed was a cascading zero-g caffeine catastrophe that left one intern bald, two consoles shorted, and at least six engineers scalded emotionally, if not physically.

Sequence of Events:

* 0859: Gravity shutdown warning issued.
* 0900: Gravity goes offline.
* 0900:03: Intern Cal sprints from Deck 3 with three uncovered hot Terrabrew cups.
* 0900:04: Internal message recovered post-incident: ‚ÄúY‚Äôall I‚Äôm bringing the juice, gravity‚Äôs on my side.‚Äù
* 0900:06: Gravity is not, in fact, on his side.
* 0900:07: First cup impacts Lt. Irmani‚Äôs panel, initiating a false alarm in Hangar C.
* 0900:08: Second cup ricochets off the ceiling, bursting open in zero-g and releasing dozens of molten Terrabrew orbs that scatter across the corridor. Several engineers experience brief scalding upon contact. One orb enters a ventilation intake and is still unaccounted for.
* 0900:09: Third cup hits Cal mid-flight, coating him in superheated beverage and initiating free-spin.
* 0900:10: Screaming begins.¬† So does the slow, rotating tumble of regret.
* 0900:10.5: A fourth cup is discovered‚Äîillegally stowed in Cal‚Äôs cargo pouch. This cup detonates against the overhead camera array, knocking out surveillance for six minutes.

Station medtechs arrived within minutes.¬† Cal was stabilized.¬† Due to widespread caramel-mocha exposure, extensive body hair singeing, and adhesive polymer bonding, full decontamination required an orbital-standard razor suite.¬† Medical notation: ‚ÄúIntern was, for lack of a better term, shaved bald by hot coffee in low-g.‚Äù

Unresolved Issues Leading to Disciplinary Review:

1. Unauthorized Beverage Transport: Station policy mandates sealed containers for all hot liquids during scheduled grav fluctuation windows. Cal reportedly ‚Äúbet‚Äù a maintenance tech he could ‚Äúdrift-deliver‚Äù the cups and stick the landing.
2. Fabricated Clearance Badge: Intern Cal gained access to Deck 3 by presenting a grav-printed badge labeled ‚ÄúCoffee Diplomat, Priority Tier-One.‚Äù Investigation is underway to determine how this bypassed access protocols.
3. Unaccounted Fourth Cup: The final, smuggled Terrabrew cup was concealed in violation of transport safety. When questioned, Cal‚Äôs only response was, ‚ÄúIt was for emergencies.‚Äù
4. Sabotage Allegations: While there is no formal accusation at this time, some staff have expressed concern that no intern could be that unaware of gravity protocols. Review board is investigating possible prank collusion with Engineering.

Post-Incident Policy Changes:

* All gravity shutdowns must now include a caffeine compliance sweep.
* No beverages are permitted beyond Level 2 corridors within 30 minutes of grav-cycling.
* Intern Cal‚Äôs likeness is now featured on safety briefings with the caption: Gravity is a constant‚ÄîCal is not.

Cultural Impact:

The phrase ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pulling a Hot Terrabrew‚Äù has entered common parlance across AMSW stations to denote any enthusiastic action undertaken without awareness of environmental conditions.¬† A commemorative coffee mug with a stylized outline of a flailing intern and the caption ‚ÄúZero-G. ¬†Full Roast.‚Äù has sold out twice in the employee store.

Status: Ongoing Disciplinary Review

Intern Cal remains in probationary standing. The review board is still determining whether his actions constitute reckless enthusiasm, tactical beverage sabotage, or merely terminal optimism.

Congratulations to our first place winner,¬†u/[ChewyBits3000](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChewyBits3000/)!! This playlist feels like a quiet exhale after a long day, a deep thought, or a beautiful memory. This is not just music to listen to; it‚Äôs music to feel. The playlist carries a tone of warmth, maturity, and ease. It invites you into a space that‚Äôs unhurried and thoughtful, perfect for weekend mornings, winding roads, or late night conversations. Every lyric feels like a line from a letter you forgot you wrote. It leans into the comfort of nostalgia without getting stuck in it, acknowledging change and transition as natural, even beautiful parts of life. Just Like Tom Thumb‚Äôs Blues‚Äù by Nina Simone carry emotional weight with grace, letting soulful vocals and powerful instrumentation tell stories of endurance and heartache. That thread continues with John Martyn‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Easy Blues‚Äù and Eric Clapton‚Äôs ‚ÄúNext Time You See Her,‚Äù both offering raw, bluesy comfort in the face of life‚Äôs complexities.

Our second place winner is,¬†u/[Born-Self9885](https://www.reddit.com/user/Born-Self9885/)! Across this tracklist, there‚Äôs a variety of sounds: crisp pop, alt-R&B, hip-hop, edgy indie, and electronica‚Äîeach bringing their own flavor to the table. It‚Äôs a playlist that feels curated by instinct more than algorithm, like a friend who knows exactly what track to throw on when the moment needs a spark. The first few songs like Doechii's ""Nissan Altima"" and ""Sports Car"" by Tate McRae give you that electric feeling of stepping out into the night with a little extra sway in your step, the kind of soundtrack that makes your reflection in the window look cinematic. This is not just music you listen to, but music you move to. It's for pregame sessions, house parties and get togethers, dancing in dark bedroom moments, or strutting through city streets with your crew. This playlist definitely lives up to its name and is your go to when you want to feel bold, electric, and just a little dangerous.
