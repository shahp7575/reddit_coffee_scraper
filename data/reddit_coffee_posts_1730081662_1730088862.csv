My first instinct will be to use these around the house but I drink so much coffee I've already converted 5 old coffee cans into planters (and I'm running out of plants!)

I met this guy two months ago at a social club meeting that occurs once every week. we became friendly and he asked me to lunch and coffee twice and i agreed, but i never thought of it as a date or anything like that, it was always just platonic. Im new to town and i didn’t know anyone here, also he’s WAY too young for me, so i just hung out with him because i had nothing else to do. 

he was only in town for his military service and was due to move back home (two hours away from here) soon, so at his last night at this social club, he wanted to walk with me to the location. he met me in front of my apartment, unexpectedly hugged me tight, and we walked there together. that night he was super touchy and it gave everyone the impression that we were together. he made me wear his jacket, and put his arm around me when we were sitting, and put it around my waist at one point. i didn’t do anything because we were both drinking and i didn’t want to embarrass him in front of his friends. 

he then insisted to walk me home, and i kept saying that i want to take a taxi alone, but he insisted. he was drunk at this point so i told him to just go home but he refused. we walked to my apartment and he made me give him a tight hug in front of my door, he wouldn’t let go and we spent like 10 long minutes in a hug with him occasionally kissing my neck. then he asked me if he can have an apartment tour, i couldn’t say no so i told him fine but just stay in the kitchen and look inside (i live in a studio).

so when we got up he hugged me again and started kissing me on my cheek and forehead, and asked me to kiss him back. i did. he then tried to ask me to cuddle with him on the bed but i refused. so he sat down on the floor and told me to sit in his lap, and im not sure why, but i did, and he made me sit in his lap while facing him. he hugged me and kept getting closer to me and rubbing my back in that position until i got up forcefully. 

then he stood up and hugged me again and was moaning and saying a lot of weird things that made me uncomfortable. when he finally asked me if he could kiss my lips, i said no, and insisted that he leaves. he said “i’ll kiss you next time” and eventually left. i felt so uncomfortable and disgusted with myself, like i wanted to tear and replace my skin. 

the next time i saw him in public i felt really weird and lightheaded, like i was going to get a panic attack. 

i basically allowed him to do it all, and none of it was really that sexual. was it assault? ",1,1730088468.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

HÓI HUMANAXES!

In the [KUAKSOLIO](/kuaksolio), we already explain what are MU-, KUAK-, SI- and NO-preference. MU, NO, SI and KUAK are the basic concepts of any logical choice. MU and KUAK are hiddenly present in our logic, but not absent. On this section, we will explain how they connect with MU-, KUAK-, SI- and NO-situations.

Let me show you this with one example. Let me invite you in this example to a restaurant. Don't worry, I'll pay but also you don't get to eat. You are only in my brain and actually nobody is eating. In this restaurant, I need to get to order my meal, what ever you really really like we are going to have as the main meal for that is the reason I have come in to this restaurant. In this example, I'm having ""schintzel"".

Right, I really like schnitzel and I have been thinking about it for a few days. So I go in the restaurant and there seems to be an odd type of situation in which you must get a menu with 4 choices: Drink, Main course, dessert and coffee.

**Drinks** 🌊  
Everyone is different, right? So I like schnitzel, I imagine you like other stuff. Drinks, in that I vary a lot: Sometimes I drink a beer, or a glass of water, or nothing, or wine, or whatever the other person is having... then for me drinks is a **KUAK-sitaution**. 🌊

**Main course**🌍  
Then, it's the main. You know I want that schnitzel, but maybe in this example they don't have (don't worry, I'll my schnitzel sooner or later). But you may have to choose between different choices that aren't your favourite meal (SI-choice 🌍) but still this is the main mean, so you will chose something for sure. This is the **SI-situation**. 🌍

**Dessert** ☁️  
They say that ""everybody likes sweets"" but I don't like sweets. I can eat them or not. I know I'm ""weird"", but for me, that's a **MU-situation**. I can them have or not, I'm entirely indifferent but you can offer me dessert and sometimes I say yes.

There are some desserts that I like more than others; others that I don't like at all; others which are also indifferent (**MU-preference**); others which I sometimes like but other times not, not a constant, that's a **KUAK-preference**.   
So in my mid it goes like this:  
MU-situation ☁️: Do you want dessert?  
Me (in my mind) : I frankly don't care... everyone is having one so let me se what ice-cream they have:  
Chocolate ice cream = **SI-preference** 🌍  
Vanilla ice cream = **MU-preference** ☁️  
Strawberry ice cream = **NO-preference** 🔥  
Nothing = **KUAK-preference** 🌊

**Coffee**  
I just don't drink coffee. I drink decaf, so let's not call that coffee. So for me, coffee is a no-situation (🔥), right? But even in a no-situation there may be choices... because you can choose not to have it or get that decaf or a tea.

So let's think know how this options look like in my head:

Drinks = KUAK-situation 🌊

Water/nothing = MU-preference ☁️ **maybe**  
Wine = SI-preference 🌍 **either**   
Juice = NO-preference 🔥 **neither**  
Beer = KUAK-preference 🌊 **but**

*""For drink, I could have* ***maybe*** *water...* ***either*** *wine...* ***neither*** *juice...* ***but*** *beer...""*

Main course = yes-situation 🌍  
Salad = MU-preference ☁️ **and**  
Schnitzel =SI-preference 🌍 **also (ever/all)**  
Soup = NO-preference 🔥 **rarely (almost)**  
Pizza = KUAK-preference 🌊 **often**

*""... then for main course, I could have* ***often*** *pizza* ***and*** *salad,* ***also*** *schnitzel,* ***rarely*** *soup...""*

Dessert = MU-situation ☁️  
Vanilla ice cream = MU-preference ☁️ **any**  
Chocolate ice cream = IS-preference 🌍 **rather**  
Strawberry ice cream = NO-preference 🔥 **rather not**  
Nothing = KUAK-preference 🌊 **or**

*""... for dessert, I could have* ***rather*** *chocolate ice cream, with* ***any*** *vanilla ice cream,* ***rather not*** *strawberry ice cream,* ***or*** *nothing...""*

Coffee = no-situation 🔥  
Nothing = MU-preference ☁️ **also/too**  
Decaf/tea = SI-preference 🌍 **some**  
Cappuccino = NO-preference 🔥 **never**  
Espresso = KUAK-preference 🌊  **a bit of (few)**

*""and for coffee, I could have* ***some*** *decaf,* ***a bit of*** *espresso,* ***also*** *nothing,* ***never*** *cappuccino after 11am"".*

Let's think about it in a table (situation top-right & preference left-below):

Therefore, we can see how all this logical concepts derive from understanding MU and its components ( NO, SI and KUAK). They are also the grammatical connectors in Babeliro, when pronounced in their word-form. I shall explain pronunciation on day 3:

* MUM = any
* RADER = rather
* INSTED = instead
* ODER = or
* I = and
* TUT = also
* LIR = almost/near
* MUx = much/often
* DEMAS = too/also
* SOM = some
* NOBOR = never
* POK = few
* LAR = maybe
* IDER = neither
* MAIY = but

**Day 2: 16 logical connectors.**

[Having a new kitchen fitted, how long realistically can I expect it to take?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/s/Nzr5eT4cld)  **Oct 15, 2024** 

No one is giving me a clear answer. Initially I was told 3 days (rip out and install new - all pre-made) now I am being told the rip out is today, an electrician is going to come at some point (we don’t know when but today/tomorrow), then when he’s done the plasterer is going to come (again no confirmed time) and it’s unlikely the new cabinets will be going in before Monday next week. 

Is this normal? Or am I being taken for a ride? 

Price is all set out, nothing on the quote about additional labour if it takes longer - but is that the game? Or did the initial person just severely underestimate the time needed? 

[How to deal with a miserable construction worker? What the fuck am I supposed to do about it!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/s/C3W7pl9fR9) **Oct 18, 2024** 

I’m currently having work done on my kitchen - it has gone ok so far - until yesterday afternoon when Mr Plasterer has showed up. 

He has done nothing but complain about everything and mutter under his breath. 

Apparently the tea I have in (Yorkshire tea) he doesn’t like. He doesn’t like my dogs being in the house. (They are confined to the living room or outside - he doesn’t have to see them and they have been very quiet - tbh they are a little stressed having so many people in the house so they are being very clingy anyway) He’s annoyed that I have things in the kitchen such as a washing machine, a dryer and a fridge/freezer. I have no where else to put them and this was explained to them - no one else has had an issue with it. 

He is muttering constantly under his breath but loud enough that I can hear. 

Like he’s doing his mix now and every minute or two I can just hear him swearing under his breath about everything - I don’t know if he’s just having a bad day but it’s irritating and constant. 

If I complain to his manager, he’s just going to get more passive aggressive and I can’t handle it. 

I mean, I say it’s been fine but it’s not. The communication of the company who is doing it is so ridiculously poor, no one can tell me anything ever - they were supposed to let us know before they come - they told us on Friday they would be here Tuesday and then came on Monday for start. 

I just want him to stop complaining, get on with his job and get the fuck out of my house tbh but every other second it’s a different groan about how he doesn’t want to be here, can’t do it or whatever he’s found to complain about in that moment. 

I’m so fed up.

[Tips for cleaning plaster dust/stains and remnants?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/s/vWwYnE0E18)  **Oct 18, 2024** 

I’m having my kitchen done at the moment - I have a not so great plaster it seems (he’s part of a larger team). He’s just gone on a break and I’ve just walked past my kitchen to see an absolute bomb site. Now I know it’s a process and it’s going to be worse before it gets better… but there is no way there is not going to be plaster dust/stains and bits left over on the appliances - I also don’t know what state he is going to leave it over the weekend and it still needs to be used. 

So, firstly - how do I go about getting rid of all the plaster dust in my house? I’m hoovering constantly, but don’t seem to make a dent in it - and it’s everywhere! 

Secondly, what’s the best way to get rid of the white plaster stains that are left after I mop or wipe up? No matter how many times I go over it, they come back once dried. Used flash spray, vinegar and bicarbonate and just washing up liquid as a last ditch effort.  

Thirdly, hard clumps of plaster - if there is any left, what do I do? Soak with warm water? Chip off? 

In reality I may just be panicking for no reason but it would be nice to know in advance so I can get anything in I may need and make a preemptive strike.

OK - I will try an keep this short as I possibly can. 

I have been having work done on my kitchen, it is through a larger company who I tell what I want, they tell me how much it will cost and deal with everything else. Everything has been fine, apart from lack of communication on their part. This was until the plasterer showed up on Thursday. I have complained elsewhere on Reddit about him looking for advice. 

He just didn't want to do the job, he has not stopped muttering under his breath and complaining since he started and he is really, REALLY dragging his feet. It got so bad on Friday I contacted the site manager, explained that I couldn't listen to him complain any more and the speed of the work was simply not where it needed to be. The site manager assured me he would be moved to a different job, well low and behold he wasn't. 

I was out of the house when he came today, and the other guys on site let him in and then left to go and get some things they needed - not too happy about this at all. 

I come home, he is stood in my kitchen, over his bucket of plaster and he is just pissing into it like a racehorse. 

I screamed at him ""what are you doing!?"" - he zipped up, looked shocked and shouted ""its not what it looks like!"" - WHAT THE FUCK ELSE DOES IT LOOK LIKE!? 

I told him to get out, which he did without argument. I rang his site manager again, he obviously didn't believe me, why would you believe me - why would anyone do that!? But I think the fact I was in hysterics has made him believe at least something has happened. 

The thing is, this guy has had a few periods of time where he has been on his own, so I don't know if this is the first time he was peeing in the bucket, or if all the plaster that is already on my walls is mixed with his urine - so I have asked them to remove all the plaster and start again. Or I am ending the contract with them and I will find someone else. 

They said that it would cost me extra! Am I mad here, am I over reacting? I mean, I don't think I can prove that he has done this, but I don't want to take the chance. 

I think I am in shock. Like who the fuck does this!?

That’s when I complained about him and asked if his manager could replace him, which he was supposed to do, but didn’t and now I have pissy walls.

I did reach out to another Trump supporter friend. It did end better, but she's still voting for him unfortunately. I may try one last time, because she hates the abortion ban...

Anyways! It wasn't all for loss though. 

I reached out to my sister, brother, bil, a few other friends, and my cousin. I'm still working it over with a few.

Last night, I met up with my best friend for drinks. After reading the advice from many of you suggesting I steer clear of alcohol for now, I decided to drive to avoid the temptation. My wife knew where I was going, and she was concerned about what people in our community might think if they found out what she did, but she also said she was happy I had someone to talk to, since she knew I was hurting deeply. Finally being able to talk to someone about everything lifted a weight off my shoulders, but at the same time, it felt like the full reality of my situation hit me all over again. It’s devastating, really.

When I got home, it was late, but she was still awake, watching our wedding video, and I could tell she had been crying. Seeing that set me off. I got angry, asking her why she was even bothering to watch it, accusing her of trying to manipulate me. She said that wasn’t her intention, that for months she had felt like she was living in someone else’s body, but now she was finally realizing how badly she had messed up. She said she watched the video because she just wanted to see us during a time when we were happy. I told her it’s a shame she didn’t realize how good we had it, how happy I was with her. I thought she felt the same way. She broke down, saying she had been stupid not to appreciate what she had right in front of her. I’m usually strong-willed, and I don’t waver easily, but this whole situation has broken me. And I’m not proud of what happened next. She hugged me, kissed me, and I let her. But just before it went any further, I caught myself. I pulled back and told her this wasn’t going to work, that she couldn’t possibly believe I could just forgive everything she did. She said she understood but wanted to talk. So, we sat down, and we talked for hours.

I asked her why she did it, and she said she had been thinking about that all day. She wasn’t sure why exactly, but she admitted she missed the excitement in our relationship. I told her I already knew that—we had talked about it before and agreed to make more of an effort: more date nights, less work. But she said it wasn’t enough. She said there were times I’d cancel date nights for work, and that made her feel like an afterthought. I owned up to my part in things but reminded her that none of it justified what she did. She agreed, but she wanted me to know what led her to make those choices. Then, I told her how I found out. She looked shocked, thinking I had only discovered the affair by going through her phone. I told her I saw her kissing him outside the coffee shop. She was floored.

I asked how it started. She said it had been going on for months. They worked closely together with a group of people, and he was always friendly, but nothing inappropriate at first. Then, when I’d cancel plans, she’d sometimes join her colleagues at the pub after work. He picked up on it, asking her why I canceled, and it started there. One night after a few drinks, they stayed behind while the others left, and he told her if he were married to her, he’d never cancel a date. They kissed, and she immediately regretted it, and took an Uber home, even though he offered to drop her off. After that, things got more subtle but continued. Eventually, they worked late nights together on a project, and things escalated.
I just sat there, listening. I told her I was devastated when I saw that she’d taken him on the trip I had planned for us. She said she was mad at me after an argument we’d had and took the trip with him out of spite. She knows now how messed up that was and wishes she could undo it all. I know I made mistakes, too. We both have demanding jobs, and I took some things for granted, but I always tried to make it up to her. She acknowledged that but said she still felt like she wasn’t a priority. I asked if she fell in love with him. She swore she didn’t, that she just liked the attention he gave her. 

She wanted to know where my head was at. I told her I was heartbroken, that I never imagined we’d be here. We always communicated, but it turns out we weren’t talking about the right things. I reminded her that cheating was a dealbreaker for me—she knew that. She said she understood if I wanted a divorce but hoped I might give her a chance to make things right.
I’m not sure if I’m being a fool, but I told her I hadn’t decided yet. I made it clear that if we were going to attempt reconciliation, there would be conditions. I told her she had to cut off all contact with him (she agreed), write down every detail of their relationship—every kiss, every trip, every time they were intimate—and if I found out she left anything out, I would leave immediately (she agreed). I also told her she had to tell our friends and family what she did (there was some hesitation, but she eventually agreed) and start individual counselling to figure out why she did this (she agreed).

In the meantime, I’ve scheduled a meeting with a divorce lawyer next week to understand my options, because I don’t want to be caught off guard again. I don’t plan on telling her this. 
Earlier today, the guy’s (AP) wife messaged me. She asked if I’d be willing to meet her later to talk. I agreed. My wife knows, but she isn’t happy about it. And for the record, my wife knew he was married all along. Apparently, he told her that his wife had changed after they got married, was treating him badly and refused to have sex with him, and that he was planning to divorce her. I’m starting to realize this guy might have been lying the entire time just to sleep with my wife.

At this point, I’m emotionally and physically drained.

I needed a new office due to baby #2 arriving and kicking me out of former extra bedroom/wfh office. Looked at relocating the fam to bigger houses in the area (HCOL) and realized it would be much cheaper to figure out a way to renovate my house to add an office. While in architecture design, I realized I'd have to pay to move a bunch of plumbing anyways, so might as well add a half bath in the new office. Figured, if I'm paying for a half bath anyways, might as well add a coffee station! And if I'm doing a coffee station, might as well ensure it kicks ass. Further slippery logic ensures.

This is my 2nd espresso setup ever, first was an old Breville Roma that I actually enjoyed a lot for many years. Then, I drank drip and cold brew only at home for a few years. Then for whatever reason my demographic profile/browsing habits, I watched a few James Hoffman videos on youtube absolutely randomly. Ended up on this subreddit, and the rest is history.

I have used La Marzocco's machines at my work place, so not completely new to pro/prosumer level machines. For awhile I was pining for a Decent, also looked at Lelit Bianca, but I looked hard within myself and realized I actually don't want to be experimenting and turning dials/nobs everyday to make coffee. I wanted quality, consistency, and bling, so LM Micra it is.

So far, my espresso really sucks but its probably only 50% on me. I tried using my old plastic Bodum burr grinder, the grind size is laughably large at espresso setting. Then I drove to Whole Foods and ground a bag using their house grinder at 2nd to last fine setting, still way too course. Then yesterday I was scouring CL/FB marketplace hard for a respectable interim grinder, and snagged a Eureka Perfetto in great condition for $350. Will have to report back, haven't tried it yet. Depending on how hard it is to dial in, I may keep or sell when my Zerno hopefully comes Feb 2025.

1gdt18m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1gdt18m/looking_for_recommendations_for_a_two_week_trip/,"Looking for recommendations for a two week trip in November. Hotel, tour guides, food, coffee, tailor, events? I tried for useful details! lol ","Hi all! I did look through a bunch of posts the last few days but I figured no harm in asking here since it seems a lot of people don't give many details when looking for recs.

Male (40) going to Bangkok for the last two weeks of next month with my girlfriend (35). Leaving from the US.

I'm looking for any suggestions on a few things:

1. Hotel. Budget about $100-low $200's/night (3500-7000 THB). Wishlist is: room with a desk with docking station/good internet/monitors since I'll have to work a bit. 5 star. Bonus for good food/bar in it, good massage/spa facilities and nice bathrooms. (Big tub or soaking tub with jets etc). So far Shangril-La, COMO Metropolitan, and SO/ Bangkok looked good but also I don't know what I don't know?
2. Guide? Wondering if it's worth it to get a personal tour guide for the first day or two just to show us around as we direct (IE: this type of food, that type of store, etc)? I've seen a lot of scammy places/experiences listed here. Looking for a service that's reputable, obviously hopefully speaks some english, $50-150 (1500-4500 THB) /day range? Any recommendations on solid/trustworthy places? I saw one place that does tours of different street food that looked cool maybe?
3. Food. She's a foodie, preferences for seafood, and funky flavor combinations so I think she'll be in heaven. She's big on ""whatever is the local specialty/style"", very adventurous palette. I really don't care either way. Looking for 1 very high end place to go to for a fantastic meal. Maybe one of the Michelin star places? Open to suggestions. Or any hidden gems! open on the price range. Maybe $150 (3000-4500 THB) /person for the fancy night. Whatever for any others.

4)Coffee/tea. She also loves coffee/tea so any recommendations of tea houses, cafes, etc that have good quality, nice experiences, tastings, etc that you'd suggest?

5) Tailor: Ok I've mostly given up on this because there are SOOOO many threads and it's hard to tell what's legit and what's covert advertising. Looking for a place to get custom suits. Ideally fairly modern, single breasted, good quality fabric, wool preferably maybe linen as well. $100-$300 USD (3500-10,000 THB) price range.  
OK with going in for multiple fittings. Ideally a place that can keep measurements on file to order online after I leave in the future. More concerned with a place that I can trust quality of the fabric and cut. Don't need anything too flashy/unique. Just solid nice business wear single breasted suits.

6) OPEN: Events? Bars? Shows? Places I need to visit?  
Me: Loves cats. fairly gothy. Fairly introverted. Enjoy reading, cafes, people watching, etc.  
GF loves anime, most styles of art, tattooing (is a tattoo artist), horror, fashion, performances, tea, kink/shibari related things  
Anything that you think would fit some of that is welcome.

7) Random Items:  
\- We will probably hit Nana plaza and/or Soi Cowboy but not really focusing on that type of tourism  
\- I vape. Easy to do around? Any issues/concerns?  
\- Esim - get it and load it before I leave the airport in the states or easy to get at the airport/mall there? Recs? so far I was thinking [https://www.ais.th/travellersim/](https://www.ais.th/travellersim/) from a rec I saw here.  
\- Taxis? Tuktuks? from airport or just around? Thoughts/suggestions? Grab a good thing to lean on for this?

So far got this for good advice:  
\- pack light and buy light linen/cotton stuff there since I'll melt in most of my owned-wardrobe. (any recommended places for just basic light clothing? Figure this should be pretty easy to find though)  
\- See the palace. Cover shoulders/knees.  
\- get Eatigo and Hungry Hub for food  
\- Chatuchak weekend market  
\- China town (GF is chinese)

Might go for a few days to a beach/resort somewhere, still looking into that but that's another whole thread and I haven't researched that much yet.

anyway, i tried the whole break thing and i was rotting in bed and crying and all i wanted was him but i knew i shouldnt want him? which just made my emotions all over the place. few days later we talked (i spoke to the girs i work with to reassure me) and i wanted nothing more than to work on this cos i love him more than anything. so we agreed to give this weekend  (25/10/24) a try (we both had friday off) to work on us and i agreed that i wouldnt be able to bring up the onlyfans thing as im essentially agreeing to stay if that makes sense? this weekend the new video game came out and he said ""dont come up, dont bother me, dont ask for me i booked these days off for my game, you can bring me a care package up"" (half jokingly half not) while we were talking i said that all i ask was for us to spend at least an hour together. 

so on friday we went and saw venom which we agreed to, venom finished at about 1pm and on the way home i wanted to stop at a maccies drive through so i could get some lunch, he pulled his face and started saying that i was taking the piss and wasting his time of gaming that he booked the day off for. i didnt even want to go in maccies i just wanted some lunch to grab it wasnt in a malicious way. so i go home and that was that until about 10pm. He came down to mine as i had a problem with my eye. it had been red and angry for a few days and now i had a mild ulcer on it so i was going under about it and i was really really worried. he came down to reassure me that i would be ok and i rang 111 as google was telling me i was going to lose my eye lmao. as im on the phone to 111, his sister is belling out my phone as he is ignoring her. he answers the phone and tells her that he will be home soon he just wants to make sure im ok and if i need to go to a&e he will take me. his sister is going off at him and so he has a go at her and she says she is coming down to where i live. so she does and they start to argue. my mum obviously isnt happy she has come down to mine holding her horn down the street setting my dogs off so she tells her to go home and leave my boyfriend alone as he is comforting me. anyway his sister rings him again when she gets home saying that im not welcome at their house anymore and im not to go to their house from now on. which obviously made me very uncomfortable and he ended up staying the night as he didnt want the wrath of his sister. 

saturday was fine , he went to his house at 11am and i spent the day with my mum, i went to the opticians and had some coffee  and lunch with her. my boyfriend rang me to  ask if we could go to nandos at 5pm instead of 7pm as his friend who he was playing his game with was going to a football game. i agreed and picked him up at 5pm to go. i texted him that i was outside and no response. i didnt really want to walk in his house as i felt uncomfortable to walk in. he ended up clocking me as he let his dog out for the potty and told me he wanted to show me his new gaming desk/set up. i said yes as long as i can see it and we go i dont want to see your sister yet, (i HATE confrontation, especially after an argument id rather just drop it and forget about it) so i walk in his place and he looks at me with his smug face and shouts his mum and makes me talk to his mum even though i said i didnt want to deal with it yet? so we go to nandos and he comments on my driving. (i hardly ever offer to drive as i always get remarks, the other day literally, he called me a pussy and shit for not pushing my way through a busy junction when it wasnt safe. (bare in mind he had been pulled over a few weeks ago for speeding by the police)) so we have nandos and we leave after our food and i stopped at the shop for a drink and he started moaning that we are wasting time and he needs to get back as his friend was back home from the game. i said if he wants me to stay at his house i need a drink and to grab my night things from home so im not going to his house to go home to go shop to go back to his house when i can just do it in one trip and save my petrol. he pulls his face so i just drive towards home and he then starts to say ""if you can grab your things and be in and out of your house LITERALLY, without stopping to talk to your mum then thats fine."" then he said he wants to grab my stuff so he can run in and out to get to his house so i told him no im not staying anymore and dropped him off as i still didnt feel comfortable being there. he then started to ring me and told me he went off and he made his sister apologise to me EVEN THOUGH i said i didnt want an apology as i feel like i never deserve apologies. i dont know why, ii just never feel like i should have someone apologise to me as im a people pleaser and im usually apologising to them and it puts me in a very weird state i dont know why? i hope it makes sense. but anyway he doesnt understand why im upset as i told him everything i didnt want him to do and he went ahead and did it. as usual. 

so today (Sunday) we were supposed to have food together and i didnt say anything about it as for the past few days it has been me trying to spend time together and i thought he would make the time. anyway he didnt and i tried to communicate through text as im respecting his wishes of letting him game this weekend and he said im arguing for arguments sake and i need to chill the fuck out, i was telling him my feelings of me feeling like im begging for a bit of his attention and he knew i was upset as i was crying to him before i went to bed and ive not had a message or a quick call. he said the phone works both ends why have i not messaged him. im obviously getting more and more upset and hes saying im holding a grudge. we are supposed to be going pumpkin picking tomorrow and i dont really want to go cos i feel that im prying him away from his game and he is just going to moan again when we get home and i want to carve them. he said he wont and that he wants to spend pretty much all day together. i dont know whether im just being a dickhead here but he told me he was gaming all weekend, friday to monday as those we the days he has taken off from work. then my overthinking chimed in and said he is probably alright spending the day with me as his friend is back in work tomorrow and he wont have anyone to play with.

1gdswwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gdswwt/am_i_the_ahole/,Am I the a-hole? ,"Hey girl hey!  First and for most, I am a big fan of you.  I discovered you through my 56 year old mom and your videos grew on me.  My favorites are the bridezillas, Karens, and rude celebrities.  I don't know if the best way for you to see this story is via email or comment section on YouTube, so I do apologize.  (Also, if you are ever in the Indianapolis, IN area I'd love to meet you!)


Anyways....... I worked in a gas station a few months ago.  I was a rehire from a couple of years ago.  It was my first week as the rehire.  MY MANAGERS asked me to go out to the lobby and do some deep cleaning.  So I grabbed the spray and rag and started emptying the coffee creamer holders and scrub the gunk.  I was told that I would be fine to focus on that, but if my other coworker asked for me to help them out obviously hop on my register and do that.  We started getting a little line.  I kept asking every few minutes if my coworker wanted me to come up and they told me I was fine.  THEN a lady looks at me and casually says, ""You're cleaning the coffee creamers."".  I looked at her and smiled, showed her the holder and said, ""Yes ma'am.  These things are disgusting and I was told to deep clean."".  

(Please note this has been close to a year ago, so some things may not be word for word but pretty spot on to this encounter.)

This lady started coping an attitude with me and said, ""Okay, I see that.  We'll you have a line."".  I chuckled nervously and said, ""Yes, I can see that.  My managers told me to focus on this and to let my coworker holler for me if she needs anything.""  She proceeded to say, ""Well, you should get back there.  You have a job and that is to check out customers, not be out here cleaning."".  We went back and forth a bit, then I remembered my managers said if customers disrespect me and will not back down after being warned they can be kicked out of the store.  
I finally said, ""Ma'am.  I've said it nicely.  I was TOLD by my MANAGERS to FOCUS on this.  I don't appreciate the way you are talking down to me.  If you have an issue with me listening to what my managers told me to do, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store."".
Her face got more red then it already was and she said, ""EXCUSE ME?  Who are you to be talking to me like that.  I'm just trying to help you out.  Just so you know, I am a manager at the gas station down the street.  How dare you try to kick me out of the store, I am not leaving.  You are not supposed to be kicking customers out of the store and getting disrespectful to them.  I will be reaching out to our district manager and reporting you.""
My co-worker heard all of this and called me back to help them (they later told me they called me back to save me from that encounter).  
I did end up having to check out the manager from the other gas station and her friend.  Both were super rude, passive aggressive, rolling their eyes, and just carried a I'm-better-than-you persona.  I'm not one to snap at people often at all, so I did apologize.  She scoffed and said, ""Oh, so you want to apologize because you now know that I'm a manager and I said I was going to report you to our district manager."".  I tried to look at her as a normal human, but I feel the inner ""Really bitch?"" showed on my face.  I said, ""Um, no?  I don't care that you're a manager at a different store and that you're going to report me.  You are not MY manager, so I don't have to listen to you.  I just wanted to apologize because I'm a grown person.""  She continued on with the tangent about how my job is to be on a register.  She basically told me to not listen to my managers.  The store would never be clean because it's the most disgusting store in our district.  She accepted my apology but informed me that she would still be reporting me to the district manager.  WOMP WOMP.
3 customers after her, the store was empty.  Wow...... Look at that.  We weren't as busy as she was making it seem like we were, hence why I focused on what I was told to work on.  The customers after her seemed to have been embarrassed for me for her behavior and apologized to me for how she treated me, and told me not to let her get to me. 
My co-worker asked me if I was okay, I ranted to them.  They said, ""Don't worry it's not you.  You did nothing wrong.  As you told her, she was disrespecting you and talking down to you.  Therefore you had every right to kick her out of the store."".  They told me that I was fine and would not get in trouble with management.  However, anxiety kicked in and I messaged my store manager and the 2 managers.  Of course they all messaged back and said I did nothing wrong and to not sweat it.  They also said that the district manager wouldn't get mad at me.  

The following week I was informed that the manager sure enough did report me to the district manager.  What did they do?  They basically laughed and simply shrugged it off, because I wasn't the one in the wrong.  Rumor has it the other manager is the one that got an ear-full for HER behavior.  Rumor also has it that the district manager did not like this manager and has been trying to get rid of her.  After this I saw her in the gas station one more time.  She had daggers for me, which makes me think the district manager putting her in her place was accurate, but she kept herself together.

Whether or not the district manager did end up getting rid of that employee, I have no idea.  I think it was comical that this manager thought she had the right to talk down to me.  A management position obviously got to her head a bit too much and she needed/needs to be humbled and put in her place.
I did ultimately leave the company for good because of how the management had double standards.  We had our common 30 tasks or so to do, take care of customers, yet they would leave stuff from THEIR shift uncompleted, THEN added an additional 5 tasks for each staff member.  If we did not get these done, no matter the circumstance, we would get a write up and potentially terminated. 
In the last meeting I attended they said, ""If you don't like what you hear, there's other jobs in the same lot.  Go work there.""  I left about a month later and *SURPRISE* went to the grocery store right down the hill.  
I've been there for a 3 months now, it's Union, I'm getting paid more, and majority of my co-workers are wonderful.  I do see my old managers and co-workers from the gas station every now and then, we are still on good terms.  As for the manager from the other store, she comes into my grocery store every now and again.  Guess what?  Her demeanor has done a 180 and she seems to be nice to me now (or at least as nice as she could be).    ",2,1730086139.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I reached out once last night and once this morning and he finally got back to me and said his friends convinced him to go out and he was hungover this morning.

I went to his place and he essentially said that he has never felt anything like this before and he thought he might have found his person in me, so he was taking this really seriously but ultimately decided he didn’t see a future.

{As the audio begins with the sounds of technical and mechanical beeping and aswell the hum of containment chambers. The researcher tone of voice sounding more composed but still tinging with unease}

This is Dr. Alistar Jorran, recording first session of the initial observation log for Subject Dash 912 dash BD. it has been just under 72 hours since its capture and transfer of this latest being. The retrieval teams has always been cautious after what happened with Subject dash 647 dash BC. well i don’t blame them.. Every one of us is still haunted by that damn ordeal. But rather this.. This is something different. Subject dash 912 dash BD Codenaming as **“The Angel”** what they calling it now.. Though the official of its designation is just as clinical as like before.. Is unlike we have ever encountered. The entity, as if i can even call it that. As it radiates light, a kind of intensity that is more far extraordinary than anything we have studied before.. Unlike the starlight aura of Subject dash 647 dash BC. no.. this is something more purer.. Its more like standing before the heart of a star. And yet without the heat. Instead theres slight warmth, a sensation that seems to.. Burrow deepened to your bones.. It just feels soothing. 

{ Pausing and before the sound of beeping on his datapad can be heard, and trying to organize his thoughts. } 

The subject is a humanoid in form, its height roughly 3.5 meters tall, with large, wing like appendages something composed entirely of this.. Radiant energy. It wings themselves seems to be pulse with light, casting shadows in impractical directions. Its rather difficult to explain. It light bends around the entity, as it created halos that extend more far beyond its physical shape, as it almost warping the reality itself… its.. Face is impossible to interpret, featureless and yet unmistakably serene. We have placed it in a Class IX Containment field, and being the strongest one we have which the same type of field that Subject dash 647 dash BC contained in. And regarding about ”**the Angel**”,  its not that we believe its hostile.. Theres no signs of aggression.. But the power it radiates..its damn overwhelming.. The readings on our readers are fluctuating more wildly. Well at first, i thought it was a interference, a malfunction in the systems but the data remaining more consistent..as though the very presence of the entity is distorted reality.. Not in the violent way Subject dash 647 dash BC do.. But in a well manner that.. Feels Peaceful.. Purposeful.

{ The Researcher taking a deep breath, and his voice becoming more softening. } 

Well..i wont lie. The moment i saw it.. I-..i felt something.well everyone in the observation room did. Its.. rather hard to describe. It was.. Awe?, maybe? Admiration?..whatever it is, its unsettling for us, but yet.. Its comforting. When it turns towards you, as it gaze meeting yours, as it though you have been seen. Truly **seen**, not just for what you are. But for anything or everything you could ever have been, or could be. I have not yet spoken to others about it..yet.. But i can tell they have felt it too..its.. In their eyes. A kind of calm have settled over the entire facility since its arrival, even though i cant still shake feeling that this “calm”.. Its  not entirely Natural.

{ A Sound of chair creaking as the researcher shifting uncomfortably in his seat } 

What is ever more curious is that the entity havent attempted to escape nor communicate, well atleast not directly. It just fucking stands there, within the containment chamber, emitting this damn light.. This divine aura. The energy it radiates.. It seems to affect our circumambient in some subtle ways. Plants in the vicinity had begun to bloom, and even those the mechanical systems in the lab, the one been malfunctioning since 647 are somewhat stabilizing. Even the strangest parts are the psychological effect is having on the staff. The morale was never this been high. People who were once plagued by nightmares and including myself, are suddenly.. At peace. But.. this.. Serenity. It feels too damn perfect. Too controlled. I cant help but wonder if.. IF its manipulating us somehow.. Not in a malicious way.. But like its guiding us.. I am not sure what to make of that..yet.

{ As he hesitated again, taking a sip of his coffee. There was sound of his hands shaking lightly against his mug is barely audible. } 

Yesterday, i have conducted the first close range observation. Approaching the containment field. it..no.. he..turned to me as i drew closer. I-i dont.. Even know. If this thing has gender or whatever it cares about such things, but something about the way it stands.. The way it carries itself.. It feels.. Masculine. Regal.. I just stood there, staring at it and for the briefest of the moment, i thought i heard something. Not a voice exactly. But rather a presence in my mind. A whisper of..what could only be described as.. **Forgiveness.**

{ as his voice cracks in a slight as he continues }

I know.. How that sounds. Its absurd ofcourse.. There was any no audible voice, not a single data suggesting if its telepathic.. But i felt it..a wave of understandment, compassion. As if it knew everything about **me**. My mistakes, ambitions.. My **fears**... everthing.. And still, it forgave me.. I havent still been able to shake that feeling since. Several of the staff members had similar experiences, though none of them seem disturbed by them.. Quite the opposite actually..as its like.. They have been…**Cleansed**.. That is the only word that comes to mind. None has expressed any fear. None of the paranoia that have plagued us during 647’s containment. If anything, they spoke of the entity with admiration, even.. Devotion. It.. just worries me. Fuck.. i mean, who are we to think this way that we can study something so..**Divine**? Theres no other word for it. The imperial reports makes no mention of this kind of power.. This is not a creature to be controlled, weaponized or to be dissected..this..is something else entirely..i have spoken with Commandant Loka and yet.. Hes pushing for further tests.. He wants to probe its resilience, to test its potential power under stress.. But.. i dont.. Think thats wise. Something about this being.. It.. feels like.. Its not meant to be caged or.. Rather tested.. I fear that if we push it even too far.. Something might break.. And when it does.. We might not survive the consequences.

{ there was another long pause, as the researcher coughing and his breathing grown even more shallow } 

Theres.. One more thing i havent spoke to anyone yet.. Last night, when i was alone in my quarters, i fucking saw **it**. Not in a dream, but in the waking world!. I fucking swear.. I saw it standing at the foot of my bed!. It wings were folded, lights were subdued, but.. It was there. Watching me. It did not say anything, as it didnt even moved, but it didnt have to..i could feel it.. The same overwhelming sense of peace and.. Forgiveness. And then just as suddenly.. It was gone. I dont know how it managed go through the field. I dont even fucking know if it was real..but ever since, i have been questioning everything.. What is this being? Why is it here? And more importantly.. What does it want?..

{ Exhaling slowly and the strain in his voice was now unmistakable }

I will be schedule more observation sessions next week or tomorrow..for now.. I will continue the document what we learn. But i fear we are standing on edge of something.. Something far even greater than we could have ever.. Anticipated.

HÓI HUMANAXES!

In the [KUAKSOLIO](/kuaksolio), we already explain what are MU-, KUAK-, SI- and NO-preference. MU, NO, SI and KUAK are the basic concepts of any logical choice. MU and KUAK are hiddenly present in our logic, but not absent. On this section, we will explain how they connect with MU-, KUAK-, SI- and NO-situations.

Let me show you this with one example. Let me invite you in this example to a restaurant. Don't worry, I'll pay but also you don't get to eat. You are only in my brain and actually nobody is eating. In this restaurant, I need to get to order my meal, what ever you really really like we are going to have as the main meal for that is the reason I have come in to this restaurant. In this example, I'm having ""schintzel"".

Right, I really like schnitzel and I have been thinking about it for a few days. So I go in the restaurant and there seems to be an odd type of situation in which you must get a menu with 4 choices: Drink, Main course, dessert and coffee.

**Drinks** 🌊  
Everyone is different, right? So I like schnitzel, I imagine you like other stuff. Drinks, in that I vary a lot: Sometimes I drink a beer, or a glass of water, or nothing, or wine, or whatever the other person is having... then for me drinks is a **KUAK-sitaution**. 🌊

**Main course**🌍  
Then, it's the main. You know I want that schnitzel, but maybe in this example they don't have (don't worry, I'll my schnitzel sooner or later). But you may have to choose between different choices that aren't your favourite meal (SI-choice 🌍) but still this is the main mean, so you will chose something for sure. This is the **SI-situation**. 🌍

**Dessert** ☁️  
They say that ""everybody likes sweets"" but I don't like sweets. I can eat them or not. I know I'm ""weird"", but for me, that's a **MU-situation**. I can them have or not, I'm entirely indifferent but you can offer me dessert and sometimes I say yes.

There are some desserts that I like more than others; others that I don't like at all; others which are also indifferent (**MU-preference**); others which I sometimes like but other times not, not a constant, that's a **KUAK-preference**.   
So in my mid it goes like this:  
MU-situation ☁️: Do you want dessert?  
Me (in my mind) : I frankly don't care... everyone is having one so let me se what ice-cream they have:  
Chocolate ice cream = **SI-preference** 🌍  
Vanilla ice cream = **MU-preference** ☁️  
Strawberry ice cream = **NO-preference** 🔥  
Nothing = **KUAK-preference** 🌊

**Coffee**  
I just don't drink coffee. I drink decaf, so let's not call that coffee. So for me, coffee is a no-situation (🔥), right? But even in a no-situation there may be choices... because you can choose not to have it or get that decaf or a tea.

So let's think know how this options look like in my head:

Drinks = KUAK-situation 🌊

Water/nothing = MU-preference ☁️ **maybe**  
Wine = SI-preference 🌍 **either**   
Juice = NO-preference 🔥 **neither**  
Beer = KUAK-preference 🌊 **but**

*""For drink, I could have* ***maybe*** *water...* ***either*** *wine...* ***neither*** *juice...* ***but*** *beer...""*

Main course = yes-situation 🌍  
Salad = MU-preference ☁️ **and**  
Schnitzel =SI-preference 🌍 **also (ever/all)**  
Soup = NO-preference 🔥 **rarely (almost)**  
Pizza = KUAK-preference 🌊 **often**

*""... then for main course, I could have* ***often*** *pizza* ***and*** *salad,* ***also*** *schnitzel,* ***rarely*** *soup...""*

Dessert = MU-situation ☁️  
Vanilla ice cream = MU-preference ☁️ **any**  
Chocolate ice cream = IS-preference 🌍 **rather**  
Strawberry ice cream = NO-preference 🔥 **rather not**  
Nothing = KUAK-preference 🌊 **or**

*""... for dessert, I could have* ***rather*** *chocolate ice cream, with* ***any*** *vanilla ice cream,* ***rather not*** *strawberry ice cream,* ***or*** *nothing...""*

Coffee = no-situation 🔥  
Nothing = MU-preference ☁️ **also/too**  
Decaf/tea = SI-preference 🌍 **some**  
Cappuccino = NO-preference 🔥 **never**  
Espresso = KUAK-preference 🌊  **a bit of (few)**

*""and for coffee, I could have* ***some*** *decaf,* ***a bit of*** *espresso,* ***also*** *nothing,* ***never*** *cappuccino after 11am"".*

Let's think about it in a table (situation top-right & preference left-below):

Therefore, we can see how all this logical concepts derive from understanding MU and its components ( NO, SI and KUAK). They are also the grammatical connectors in Babeliro, when pronounced in their word-form. I shall explain pronunciation on day 3:

* MUM = any
* RADER = rather
* INSTED = instead
* ODER = or
* I = and
* TUT = also
* LIR = almost/near
* MUx = much/often
* DEMAS = too/also
* SOM = some
* NOBOR = never
* POK = few
* LAR = maybe
* IDER = neither
* MAIY = but

**Day 2: 16 logical connectors.**

So my first date was at 25. And my first time in a bar was 24, I agreed to this bar date the guy came to my area and found a place- met at 7pm. My friends said bars are totally normal for a first date but I felt a bit uneasy that bar may not be the best. Anyway, we meet and go. I’m under the impression he was tipsy and he admitted he was pregaming with friends and even getting drinks after we split. It was so loud I couldn’t hear him, he couldn’t hear me. Kept saying what. He texted me a bit after but faded out. Second guy suggested a bar and my friends said maybe suggest a more “lounge-like” bar that is quieter/ has a different scene. The bar he found was a hotel type of bar, near him, and he wanted to meet at 8:30pm. I haven’t yet decided what to do. the first guy in my story is one I kind of knew from school. 2nd is a guy who started a convo with me in a restaurant and I gave him my google voice number. 

Any other time I’ve had a guy suggest a bar, I’d suggest a coffee shop instead or something during the day. I’m a bit on edge about a date after 7:30pm. I know we work- but it’s just a feeling I guess. And anytime I suggest not drinking I get either no answer or they agree and slowly fade out. It’s totally fine they do that and I don’t expect a dinner date.. I just prefer drinks not be involved as how can I assess the person?

No.
In order to be really successful, not average successful, people need to push themselves, much beyond their comfort zone. A few months of tiring weeks are nothing compared to the boost that working on something post 9-5 full time job.
My question is simple - what should I work on?
I work in tech, hw/sw/fw, with 0 YoE (recent undergrad), and do not have any commitments that people with a few years down their 20s start having. Currently, I am confused among several options such as taking some online courses, working on startups (not with the intent of succeeding, but learning), contributing to open-source, general tool skill building, reading up on tech developments, etc.

My major shortcoming is that I'm not inherently looking to code in my free time; some people do, some people just love coding as much as drinking coffee when they're free, they just always have. And I would love to do the same, but when there are no definite boundaries, it becomes hard to gauge how and what to do. In college, there was always accountability for projects and/or competitiveness(grades), leading to an automatic ""pressure"" that helped me never feel like quitting class-related stuff. Similar approaches go for jobs, there's accountability and definite pressure.So unless there are visible strings attached to my work, I don't feel like doing it. No matter how hard I try or how much time I put in, I eventually quit.

I found out everything and it’s worse than I could have imagined. 

Last night, I checked her phone while she was in the shower. She had left her phone in the bedroom and it was not passcode protected. Maybe she thought I wouldn’t check. Maybe she got too comfortable lying to my face. Either way, she made a mistake. I went through her phone and found the separate messaging app to communicate with him. And that’s when everything unraveled. 

Their entire relationship was right there. There were thousands of texts, and even pictures - some lasting well into the night while I was asleep next to her. It wasn’t just a fling. This has been going on for MONTHS. They’ve been meeting up regularly — coffee shops, hotels, ""client lunches."" She’s been calling him pet names. There was talk of “missed moments” and “wishing for more time together.” The worst part? She has been telling him things she used to say to me. Word-for-word. ""You make me feel alive."" The exact phrase she used when we first started dating. That was our thing, and she recycled it for him. I felt physically sick. After years of being together, of building a life, that’s how she sees it. Like everything we’ve built together meant nothing.
I also found out the work trip she’s going on next week was not just business. They’ve planned everything: dinners, hotel rooms, more “alone time.” She’s treating this like some kind of romantic getaway with him, while I sit here like a fool. 

I thought I’d already hit my breaking point. I thought nothing could hurt worse than the betrayal I’d uncovered. But then I found out something that knocked the wind right out of me—like a punch straight to the gut. I booked us a cabin for the weekend two months ago. It was an opportunity for us to reconnect, just the two of us. A day before the trip, she said her company needed her to drive to another city for the weekend to meet with clients, that it was urgent and she couldn’t get out of it. She was so apologetic, especially because it was 24 hours out and non-refundable. She even promised she'd make it up to me. I remember telling her it was okay, that I understood. I even felt bad for her having to miss out on what I thought would be a special time for us. I didn’t take the trip that weekend because I didn’t want to go without her, and as annoying as it was, I accepted that the reservation had gone to waste. I found that she had sent the booking confirmation to him and nearly lost it. Then, I saw the photos. Walking by the lake. Sitting by the fireplace, wine glasses in hand. The weekend that was supposed to be about us became their little fantasy escape. I can’t even describe how that felt. She canceled our trip to take him instead. 

I realized then the full extent of her betrayal and I lost it. I almost threw her phone across the room but I didn’t because all the evidence was on there. When she finally came out of the shower, I couldn’t pretend anymore and anyways she could tell something was very wrong. So, I confronted her. I asked her if there was something she needed to tell me. She said, no, but I could see the panic set in. I pressed harder, told her I knew everything. The emails, the lunches, the hotel stays. Her fucking affair. She started crying and apologizing. I asked her why she had done it. She said it was a mistake, that she got caught up in the excitement, that she missed the feeling of something new. I asked if she loved him. She said no, she loved me and wanted to be with me. I asked if she slept with him and she said yes. I told her how much she had destroyed me, how she shattered everything we built. I asked her if she ever thought about what this would do to me, to us. She just sat there, crying and apologizing over and over. I told her I was done, that there was no coming back from this. She begged for forgiveness. I told her to get out, to go be with him since she wanted him so badly. She broke down, insisting she didn’t want him—that she wanted me, and she’d do anything to fix this. By then, it was almost midnight, so I told her to sleep in the guest bedroom. She asked for her phone back, but I refused, saying I was holding onto it for now. When she tried to argue, I warned her: if she took the phone from me, I’d leave. She didn’t want that, so I kept it.

Once I was alone, I forwarded the entire thread of their messages to myself. I went through them in more detail. That’s when I found out that the guy is married, too. There was no mention of kids, though.

This morning, we barely acknowledged each other. No words were exchanged. I gave her the phone back, but I made it clear: if she goes on her work trip, she’ll come back to an empty house. She promised she wouldn’t go. She apologized again, but I wasn’t ready to hear it. After she left for work, I broke down. For the first time since this all started, I cried.

EDIT: I am coming to realize that my marriage is a sham, so this will be my last update on this sub. Tomorrow I will go to the guy’s house. I found his address from her google maps recent history. I have printed the message thread between them along with the pictures and will be giving them to his wife, who is unaware of what is going on as far as I know. I will also face this man who quite literally destroyed my life. I am done playing nice.

The next few posts will be posted in the same format the OP originally posted them.


I caught my wife cheating on me with another man and I am utterly devastated Part 2.

Last night was one of the hardest nights of my life. I spent it in the car, needing space to process everything. A hotel wasn’t an option for reasons I’ve explained elsewhere. Knowing my wife’s routine and that she leaves for work before I do, I returned home in the morning after she had already left to shower and change before heading to work myself.

Where I’m at mentally: I feel deeply hurt and betrayed. All night, I couldn’t stop thinking about the life we’ve built together and how it now feels destroyed. I’ve been trying to recall any red flags I might have missed. I’m at a loss because we’ve always been good at talking through everything. Recently, though, she’s been busier at work, which has led to less communication between us, but I didn’t see it as a major issue at the time. A few months ago, she mentioned missing the excitement in our relationship. We talked about it and agreed that this is normal in long-term relationships, and we committed to taking steps to bring that spark back. We’ve followed through, aside from occasional busy periods. I take care of myself, and I think I’m an interesting person and a good husband, so I’m left wondering if she sought excitement elsewhere. That’s the only explanation I can come up with, and it makes me incredibly angry. Right now, I’m feeling 80% hurt and 20% angry, but I know the anger will grow in the coming days and weeks.

As for the guy, I only know his name, and that he works closely with my wife on a new project. I assume he’ll be part of the upcoming work trip too. She’s never mentioned him beyond that, and I have no idea if he’s married or in a relationship.

Here’s what I’m planning to do next:

1. I’ve already spoken to a few divorce lawyers, and while I live in a fault-based location, proving adultery in court can be a long and expensive process. Also, we need to be separated before filing for divorce.

2. Tonight, I plan to go home and act like I don’t know anything (which will be difficult) so I can gather more information about the extent of her relationship with this guy. When I confront her, I’ll reveal one thing I’ve found out and see if she’ll admit the rest. I also want to learn more about the colleague—if he has a partner, she deserves to know as well. The challenge here is I’m not sure how to gather more details. Some have suggested getting a PI, but that feels extreme. If anyone has experience with this or other ways to get more information, I’d appreciate your input. I’m also not sure how I’ll feel once I know everything. I’ve always said I wouldn’t forgive cheating, but I still love my wife. Maybe once I have all the facts, I’ll see things differently and be ready to move forward with separation and divorce.

3. I’ve opened a new bank account and applied for a new credit card. I’ve updated HR of the account information to ensure my paycheck is deposited into the new account. Over my dead body will I let her spend any more of my money on him, if that’s what she’s been doing.

4. I’m going to use work as an excuse to avoid intimacy with her. Honestly, throwing myself into work and handling these next steps will help keep me from losing my mind.

5. Therapy will come later. For now, it’s easier to type this all out than to speak about it. Talking about it aloud would make it too real, and I’m not ready for that yet. I also don’t want any friends or family to know about this for now. Speaking with lawyers was different because it felt more practical.

6. I will reach out to my doctor to request the STI tests. 


A few other points to make: 

My wife and I don’t have typical jobs. We sometimes work at the office, but we also spend a lot of time meeting clients at various locations. So, we spend a lot of time commuting, which means grabbing coffee/lunch on the go. We work in a large metropolitan area, and we’ve never crossed paths during the day—until yesterday. It so happened that yesterday, during one of my commutes, I happened to be at a location a little further out which is why I decided to grab lunch in that area. 

Some people took issue with my writing style. Writing has always been an outlet for me, and it helps me process my feelings. I will leave it at that. 

My wife and I know each other’s Reddit usernames, so I didn’t post this on my main account, where she could see it. This is a sub she doesn’t visit, so it’s unlikely she’ll come across this. But if she does, then, fuck it. It is what it is.

1gdskj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1gdskj5/seasons_really_change/,Seasons really change,"Last night, I was reading through my blog that I kept on and off til 2021. I used to write a lot about my breakups and how I was going through it. 

I read a lot of things: from my exes’ lovebombing to them leaving me. I remember reading one of my exes say that he really wants to end up with me. This ex was who I thought was my greatest love. We were like two peas in a pod. I thought he was my soulmate. We got along really, really well. It was fun whenever I was with him. Every time I used to tell him that I love him, he’d respond with “I love you more” and that just made me swoon. We used to talk about living together, who’d do the dishes, who’d clean the house etc. I used to imagine chill Sunday mornings with him, drinking coffee, talking about the mundane things. It was great, until it was not. 

When we broke up, he told me he’d always love me and that I’ll always be a part of him. I also told him I’d always, always love him. But do I still love him now? Heck no. 

I thought back then that I would never ever find someone like him and that I can’t ever love someone more than I loved him. I was partly right, every person is different so I would really never find anyone like him. 

What I didn’t know was a year later, I would find my now husband, or he’d have found me. What I thought was my greatest love is now just one part of my past. Those Sundays I used to imagine with my ex, those plans about who’d wash the dishes once we started to live together, has been all replaced by my husband. My husband turned out to be my actual greatest love because it is a love like no other. 

So if you’re going through a rough breakup right now, I hope you’ll be comforted by my experience (albeit a short retelling of it). Seasons really change and time does heal all wounds. One day, you’ll forget this person who broke your heart and one day, all of the things you wanted to do with this person, you’re doing with someone better. Just don’t give in to your impulses to go back. The sooner you move on, the sooner happy days will come and the sooner you can meet the actual love of your life.

This is the RTA supporter and gear setting tool Epic-sense.

[www.epic-sense.com](http://www.epic-sense.com)

It is updated so I will let you know what is updated this tool.

(sorry for my english is not good..)

 1. RTA support tool is upadated.

\- If you register your hero after signing up, you will recommend a pick among the registered heroes

\- There is no e-mail authentication or other means of authentication when signing up for membership. In other words, you can sign up comfortably with any e-mail.

https://preview.redd.it/ofbr7ujcwexd1.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=87ef1250a483b64b22adbc3737e2f171caa3f96a

 \- Click on the hero I have on My Page to register once the box is ticked. - You can unlock registered heroes on the owned heros.



https://preview.redd.it/axytqgpnwexd1.png?width=1662&format=png&auto=webp&s=b11a5fa0998f989abfb19e9cfa36a6622496e800

\- Once you access the RTA support page, you must first select a free-ban character.

\- Characters selected as van will be shown in red as shown in the photo.

\- You can set up two or four characters in the upper right corner. 

\- If you choose ALL HEROS, you recommend a pick among all heroes, and if you choose MY HEROS, you recommend a pick within the hero pool I registered.

\- The first pick/second pick switches left and right similar to the in-game UI.

\- Select reset conditions to initialize all states. You can start from Banpick again.

\- I will translate hero names to english soon.



2. hero detail pages updated.

https://preview.redd.it/610lyoeaxexd1.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c26114fdb967f129f043e05203e2bb189d70803

\- It shows five hero setting methods like the existing hero information page.

\- However, if you choose each set, you can see the average stat information for that set.

\- You can choose the hero's desired setting method and set that hero to match its average stat.

\- At the bottom, we show up to four recommended artifacts for the hero and a detailed description of them.



3. The gear setting page is updated.

https://preview.redd.it/4eibc9exxexd1.png?width=1857&format=png&auto=webp&s=976ad945d4a26aa13b673e6d14ba2610c9c2aa50

\- Convenience has been improved from the previously uncomfortable toggle method to selecting the corresponding equipment and option icons.

\- It is Korean too. But you can use with icons. I will translate english soon.

\- The equipment recommendation logic has been changed, so we recommend the equipment to a more suitable hero.

  
As I put the data in manually, there may be bugs or errors sometimes.  
  
If you let us know about bug reporting and improvement requests through inquiry, I will revise/reflect them as soon as possible.

1gdsipg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/1gdsipg/work_trip_in_jackson/,Work trip in Jackson ,"Hi! 24F, just had a four day work trip in Jackson and had to commute everyday to a small town an hour outside of Jackson. 

I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed my work trip. I’m a native Texan, and have to travel a lot for work. This year, I’ve been sent a lot to the east coast, and finally got sent on a work trip to the south. 

Coming from Texas, (driving south from Jackson), y’all are some pretty good drivers. NO ONE rode up my butt, in fact, I admitted to myself that I was driving too fast because of my Texas driving habits. I could actually go the speed limit. I adore all the beautiful trees that lined the roads, and just the backroads were so peaceful. 

I realized how much I missed true southern hospitality. At the small town I was working in, I found a coffee shop, and asked the two baristas if they had some nail salon recs, and we ended up talking for 15 minutes. 

I ended up getting my nails done in Jackson, and it was such a pleasure to get my nails done in a REAL salon, not one of those gimmicky “aesthetic” ones. This one, was only three ladies working, by appointment, and everyone was chatting and laughing, and singing to the music playing. Felt like a scene out of steel magnolias or something. 

The salon was humble but immaculate. The manicurist took her time on my nails, and was amazing. My french gel manicure was only $45 and looks phenomenal. Where I’m from, all the salons have at least 20 tables and at least 10 pedicure chairs, and you feel just like another number, and it’s not a relaxing experience. Oh, and a simple gel manicure, without french, will cost you $80. Without tip. 

I ate some bombbbb food, in Jackson and out in the country. Had some really good Ramen, Jamaican, and Soul food. Still thinking about the burger I got from a food truck out in the country, it was so simple, but so so good. Your girl had lots of food options!

I enjoyed taking the long way and seeing beautiful porches, heck I even waved to a older lady in her rocking chair, (like I’m some local or something lol). TSA and the airline worker who checked in my bag were even pleasant!!! 

I will be volunteering myself for more work trips in Mississippi, y’all some good, hardworking people! ",44,1730084780.0,mississippi,3,0.96,False

Part 16: The second day at Azur Lane.,"Part of a few short stories, with the intentional purpose of exploring a group of ""branches"", or ""test sites"", that have developed a new branch of Azur Lane dedicated to fight landbased Siren forces.

Summary:

After their dinner at the Iris dorm, Doctor bethencourt and Song get ready to get onto their planned activities. For Commander Anderson, this means bringing people he can trust to ascertain how good or useful these new findings are.

[Previous part](https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/1g7ln1b/siren_thesis_part_153_the_third_encounter/)

////

The rest of the dinner at the Iris Dorm went the same way many other official dinners usually went like. The rest of the dishes were served, some small talk occurred regarding the dinner, some more talk now about personal relationships, a bit more talk about professional work. Then, thankfully to break out of that, some really great desserts were offered, at this point Song finally understood why Le Malin would go out of her lazy ways in order to come to a somewhat stuffy formal dinner, the desserts that Dunkerque made were at least worth 2 formal dinner events, 2.3 if she were to be more precise on the matter, and only if she wasn’t the person who would have to be the focus of all the talking taking place.

For that particular dinner the Doctor took the brunt of it, answering several questions as well as dialing up the charm, putting up the whole “social butterfly” act up. She had been truly grateful for that, otherwise she would face the risk of her food getting cold, with a plethora of questions being thrown her way rather than more meaningful things, like ice cream or a good puzzle.

Things had ended up in a calm note, just some more talk about the likely schedule for the next day, which was some more tests performed by Vestal, that much Song was certain would happen regardless of anything else that could be in the agenda, after all, she really had no official registration under any nation nor had she had any sort of official medical record. So far Vestal seemed to be the serious and caring kind, as such, Song estimated that she would spend the first few days trying to establish a specialized medical record, rather than performing all the tests that would bring light to Song’s true nature as well as her capabilities. Which in reality, was something that suited her just fine.

The room offered by Richelieu, within the Iris dorms, was rather comfortable. To Song it was a big surprise that the “nostalgia for home” part of her trip took place when she realized that the room was much more comfortable than what she was used to. Bigger, brighter, better furnished and a whole plethora of things that Song would never let Doctor Bethencourt forget. It was plain comical that with the power of creation at hand, the man had decided to go for minimalistic and functional décor.

 

The next morning, regardless of them being in a whole different place much different than her room at the Doctor’s facility, went by much in the same way as any other day at their facility much to her own surprise. Song was aware that the doctor was a passionate man of discipline and habits, but she didn’t think he would go as far as to continue his habits even in completely foreign places, such as Azur Lane. And for better or worse, that included the things he did for her as well.

As such, her day started pretty much the same it did every day, with the Doctor waking her up, helping her change to her comfortable day clothes, which now included a hair accessory, gifted by Richelieu. The Doctor dedicated a few minutes to having her do light stretches, being a firm believer that it was the very least one could do to keep a healthy body for a healthy mind, “Even when swamped with work, some lightening up the stress on the joints will do wonders for your day” as he was wont to say.

Their morning routine would always continue with the doctor brushing her hair while she would do some puzzles or mental exercises, small things like sudokus, word puzzles, and then some rounds of various mind games on an outdated handheld console that the Doctor simply adored. The thing was likely decades old. The new battery that had replaced at some point the original one needed a rigged custom setup and specialized hardware just to avoid firmware issues, restrictive firmware placed by the same company that abandoned the console after a few years of barely dedicated service, and a plethora of other issues. But the Doctor had the right of it, the thing had a charm of its own, and the games were simple yet properly aimed towards specific core aspects of the mind’s performance, such as memory, math, reflexes and judgmental capabilities, as such it was an acceptable part of her morning routines.

The Doctor was still going over her hair, even though she had somewhat short hair that barely reached her shoulders, the doctor would always dedicate much more time than necessary, probably because he was used to handling much longer hair. That always bothered her a little bit, an annoying weight on her chest, due to something that was completely out of her control and in which she had taken no part at all. As such, she decided she would rather focus on her mental exercises, or the Doctor would soon notice she had her thoughts elsewhere.

Her myriads of thoughts and calculations came to a halt when there was a knock on their door.

“ *Doctor? Miss Song?* ” Came a voice on the other side of the door, after the gently rapping on it

*“<Yes, we are here!>”* The Doctor gently patted Song on her head, as a manner of saying he was going to check on the door.

The doctor made his way to the door, he opened it and engaged into some small conversation with whoever was on the other side, it only took him a few moments to do a “good morning greet” and dispatch the person that had come.

“ *<It was miss Algerie, seems like Doctor Vestal came to check on you before breakfast>.* ” He told Song once he had closed the door.

As per usual whenever they were on their own, they would speak in Irisean, the Doctor’s native language. Song greatly enjoyed those private conversations, those felt like they were disconnected from their usual businesses and chores at their home, more intimate and familial.

“ *<Uh? Should we be concerned about that?>* ” Song asked, turning off the handheld device and gently putting it back onto the protective case the Doctor had for it.

“ *<Well, that depends, do you still dislike needles?>* ” He asked, wiggling his eyebrows and smirking at her.

“ *<Ugh, I could certainly do without… So, what is that about? Came to give me some shots before we could even get some food?>* ” Song pouted, the idea of becoming some guinea pig so early in the morning was not her definition of ideal.

“ *<We will see, she probably wants to get some blood tests done while you haven’t eaten anything yet, those need to be done under an empty stomach>* ” The Doctor shrugged his shoulders as he said that, putting up a brown light jacket and picking Song’s sandals, bringing those to her.

“ *<If it comes to something you don’t want to do, we can always say no.>* ”

In response, Song raised an eyebrow at the Doctor, that response seemed too easygoing and carefree for him and his usual scheming.

“ *<What am I missing? There’s something else you have foreseen>* ” Song accused him, her brows now knitted together as she was trying to figure out where would the Doctor’s mischieful fun come from.

*“<Are you familiar with the procedures to measure blood sugar levels?>* ” The doctor wiggled his eyebrows playfully.

“ *<Wha?- with my blood?! Does she plan to take a blood sample?>* ”

“ *<I’m certain we will find out soon enough>* ”

“Ugh…” Song groaned, throwing her head back against the comfortable chair, her legs waggling with ease as the chair was a bit too high for her size, paddling almost as if she was trying to shake the sense of queasiness by doing such a motion.

*What’s the point of being a living embodiment of a core concept of humanity if it involves so many bloody needles?*

*“<Are you ready, my little duckling? I think I hear her out of the door already, so I am sure she really wants to get it done before breakfast>* ” The Doctor said.

“ *<Ugh… of course it would be before I get the opportunity to get a bite of anything>* ”

 

“Ah! *Docteur* Vestal! such a pleasure to be able to meet you again, first thing in the morning!” Doctor said, dialing up the charm again.

“Good morning to you too, Doctor Bethencourt” Vestal greeted back with a minute bow of her head.

“And good morning to you too, Song” Vestal then greeted Song, which seemed much more animated and genuine, compared to her professional words towards the Doctor

“I hope I’m not intruding too much, but I thought it would be better to get blood samples for the general tests done as soon as possible, since those need to be done with at least 6 hours of fasting as a standard. Since good food is easy to come by at the base, I usually take a more aggressive approach to this” Vestal explained, while at the same losing no time and taking some of the necessary things to get started with the procedure.

Song winced at that, the doctor had simply patted her on the back, so it was entirely her call on which action to take and weigh the possibilities. Which given the personality of the Doctor, it meant that regardless of whatever she might decide, it didn’t really affect their plans.

Nevertheless, there was a certain merit in performing a blood test knowing it would be performed by a Kansen military doctor, she most likely had a wider database to compare her blood sample and probably a much more health oriented mentally when it came to the tests done. Back at her facility they had databases to compare her blood against, but given the sort of people involved and their mentalities, she was inclined to believe they were more likely able to find the genomes involved into enhancing intellect, or wisdom cube sensitivity, than to be able to tell her if she had dangerously high sugar levels, or if she had any common illness to be concerned about.

Which was another intriguing point, there could be sicknesses unique to Kansen, it would be negligent to believe there weren’t any. Yet all the information that the Doctor and Song had been able to review, either in databases available at the facility, or within the Network, those didn’t make mention of any. They had discussed this before, and had concluded that, there were in fact none in existence, which was highly unlikely, or that all sorts of Kansen’s medical records were safeguarded and given only to those that did require the knowledge. Such as a Kansen doctor.

Song sighed at that. It was obvious she had much more to gain from having her blood analyzed than from avoiding the queasiness of the experience.

“Ok, I agree. But can you make it the least painful possible?”

“I promise I will try my best” Vestal answered honestly “I have some experience when dealing with Kansen’s unique bodies, so at the very least I won’t stab a needle at you blindly.”

“Now, please take a seat and I’ll proceed to make it as quick as possible so you can have your breakfast.”

 

With the blood sample over, Song could only hold the piece of cotton to her arm and glare at Doctor Bethencourt who purposefully looked in other directions, evidently trying to avoid meeting her eyes. The thing that Song had learned from the brief procedure was that apparently everyone within her facility was mediocre at medical needlework. Her experience with Vestal had been enlightening, the work had been swift, aside from the uneasiness from seeing her blood being taken, there was nothing to it but a little pinprick that amounted to the same amount of pain as a pinch on her arm.

She was now certain that she would personally see onto training some decent medical staff once they were back home.

Vestal had accompanied them to have breakfast, she had been quickly invited to stay, and even though she had originally gently refused the invitation, she was soon found by Suffren’s sister, Foch, who had insisted on her staying. Apparently, she had originally intended to wait for them to finish their breakfast in order to get the first of another two smaller samples of blood, only a droplet according to her, to be able to establish sugar levels as well as how fast Song would process them.

It made sense, perfect sense in fact, to establish a control sample, then one after the food and a second one after a predetermined amount of time, which would be taken after she had undergone various other medical tests that had been left “for later” the day prior. Song could see how it all made sense and used her time efficiently. She didn’t like it one bit, much less the part about stabbing her fingertips with a needle, but it made sense to her.

\--

Doctor Bethencourt had left Song in Vestal’s hands, after all, most of the tests could be done without his assistance at all. Plus, he was certain that he had pushed Vestal enough that she preferred to do things without his presence and that suited him just fine.

Also, there were other things for him to do, as such he asked Dunkerque who had once again assisted them on their meal, to help him contact the commander. After all, he did bring various kinds of experimental pilotable Siren-based vehicles as well as weaponry, he was sure that would be enough to keep him and everyone else occupied for at least a full day.

At some point, Zuikaku had arrived again in order to continue accompanying Song, he welcomed her and invited her to join breakfast. Just as he expected, she seemed somewhat torn about the invitation, as Vestal seemed to be ready to leave without her, the doctor gave her an easy way out, letting her know that she would be much more useful escorting Song than staying with him. She actually thanked him and left along with Song and Vestal.

Once they left, he found himself alone for a while at least, until Dunkerque came to check on him and ask him if he had enjoyed the food.

He sincerely thanked Dunkerque for their breakfast, regardless of his personal life choices, or his views on many things, he could certainly appreciate a balanced warm hearty meal as a day starter as well as perfectly made Irisian bread, which Dunkerque brought to the level in which it could be considered an art form. He invited Dunkerque to take a seat and accompany him while he waited for the response of Azur Lane’s commander. He was certain the commander would send someone for him, one way or another. As such, he decided he could use some good company and maybe make some more small talk about their home nation over a cup of coffee.

 

He really didn’t wait too long, within perhaps ten minutes two Kansen that he had yet to meet made their way inside of the Iris dorms, finding him at the table in which he was currently drinking coffee with Dunkerque. They introduced themselves briefly and professionally, which made the doctor certain that the two of them were playing the part of inner military police as well as escorts. Chapayev from the northern parliament, and Pennsylvania from the Eagle union, both wearing uniforms and colors that looked the part for said countries’ military branches, if maybe with reproachable levels of liberties on how they wore them. He invited them to take a seat and chat for a little while, which seemed to tempt them to a certain degree, but they also had their orders and they intended to keep their word true to the commander. Which was a response that the Doctor had expected.

He thanked Dunkerque again for the meal as well as the company. He honestly enjoyed the brief talk, and he felt he had to make it clear.

Within minutes they found themselves in a military car making their way to the safety warehouses by the port, where everything he had brought from his facility had been placed at. He had been requested by the commander to bring “a little bit of everything he was willing to demonstrate to them” and the Doctor was happy to oblige on that matter.

Much to his astonishment, he had been truthfully surprised when he reached the warehouse. He had found the main specialized workforce of Azur Lane, the bulins, ready to assist with moving cargo much bigger and heavier than themselves. Then again, the Doctor stopped to think properly on that specific train of ideas, that specific wording was wrong, since perhaps only Song and maybe some of the submarine girls would be smaller than the bulins, as such about anything they would carry was bigger and likely also heavier than them.

The little girls were the apparent equivalent of a competent if goofy mechanic and a super powerful tugboat all in one, taking only two of them to lift about anything in the warehouse, mostly just to keep whatever was being carried stable between the two bulins as a safety measure, since they seemed to be able to carry about anything by themselves. The Doctor was able to actually see such an example when he entered the warehouse, with two bulins carrying a shipping container, which required one on each side, evidently if only to maintain the huge container parallel to the ground. As such, it was within just a few minutes that the diminutive mechanic crew had arranged all the equipment that the Doctor had told them to pick onto trucks, even the metal containers with the siren ground drone replicas. Once everything was loaded onto the vehicles a couple of bulins got onto the trucks as well, likely in order to help unload all of the cargo once they had reached their destination.

\--

The commander had arranged everything for the moment when Doctor Bethencourt would be ready, thus, when the Doctor had decided to call him the very next morning, in order to showcase the equipment he had brought, the commander only required to make a couple of calls, inform Helena that they would be doing the tests on the things Doctor Bethencourt had, and left Saratoga in charge of his office for the time being. He had somehow finished up all the paperwork that the Union aircraft carrier had given him as punishment, so he was able to count with her whole support, for the time being, until he managed to accomplish something deemed too foolish or too risky for his station.

With Helena alongside him, they both got into a military service vehicle and headed to one of the various locations they used for various tests within the base. A location that had enough flat ground, for various purposes, as well as being close enough to the sea, which was the barest base requirements for any sort of tests ever done in Azur Lane. The trip almost didn’t register to him, while Helena drove the car, he was too busy making one call after another to those within his inner circle. Even if he had plans ready to take into action which only needed so much as a push from him, he would rather still make the personal calls for those that he trusted and needed by his side.

They arrived before anyone else, which was to be expected, he took advantage of whatever free time he had managed to create to help Helena set up a command post, which for this consisted mostly of just a few desks, some chairs, a couple laptops and an whiteboard, the barebones for whatever could take place, for now at least, once Akashi and a few of the girls from the research lab arrived they would surely bring with them all manner of gadgets they would use to measure and observe the results, in reality his job was to observe and give pause to what was to take place on these tests.

They had barely managed to finish installing the whole base arrangement when they heard more vehicles arrive. Heading out of the tent to greet the new arrivals, the commander was glad to see he had the right of it, with a couple more vehicles arriving and parking right beside the one he had come in. In a blur of movement the passenger of the vehicles came out, rather than coming to salute him all of them started moving various container boxes and devices, setting them by the commanding tent, a cacophony of orders being said to some of the bulins that had came out of the vehicles, as well as some of the human personnel from Azur Lane, as soon as various orders had been given and the two Kansen in charge had made sure things were properly understood, then they made their way to greet the commander.

“Comrade commander!” Soobrazitelny cheerfully greeted. “It’s such a great thing to be called by you to try out new findings! Personally, I prefer to do the tinkering, but new discoveries must always be peer reviewed!” The northern Kansen said with her usual excitedness about science.

“Heya, Commander!” Next came Da Vinci with a clipboard on her arm “I agree! I prefer to create new tools and devices, but it is exciting to be able to examine a whole new discovery!”

“I am glad to see you here. Would it be safe to assume that Yuubari and Chkalov will remain at the lab?”

“Yes, comrade. They wanted to prepare things in case Song arrived early. Unlikely, yet there are many things they can work on while they wait” Soobrazitelny said while nodding twice.

“The two of you didn’t just dump everything on them to make your way here?” Commander Anderson was barely able to contain a smile from showing on his face, knowing full well the sort of shenanigans the more intense Kansen could get up to.

“Commander! You wound me! We won fair and square a lucky draw none of us had any way to manipulate, just to be here” Da Vinci exclaimed with obvious pretended pain on her face. Which lasted a whole second until her excitement got the best of her.

“So, what are we looking at here Commander? You mentioned Siren-like hardware, but the official report was elusive at best.” Da Vinci asked, practically bounding in place.

“That’s because that’s not the final version of the official highly classified report, that no one should have been able to read yet.” Anderson raised an eyebrow as he looked at Da Vinci.

“Comrade, there shouldn’t be secrets between friends! We are only helping each other here by making things easier for everyone!” Soobrazitelny had quickly jumped in, her arm around the commander’s shoulders and her countenance the same as if they were simply sharing stories over drinks.

The commander rolled his eyes internally at that, it meant there was a breach of security to his computer that even BT had not found, which was something he could address at this moment given that the main culprits were likely in front of him. But then again, he felt that he would rather have all his personnel working at their best and focused on what was to come, as such, reprimands and official punishments could wait. Chapayev and her Happy Polar Penitentiary were not going anywhere, after all.

“There are many things I could barely believe when I saw them, and in all honesty, I would prefer if you came with an open mind for this.” He cleared his throat as he prepared his next words, which were truly heartfelt “I need your honest opinion on what you will see. What we saw at that facility were things that if true, could change the course of the war, and perhaps not only this war, but all wars to come too. As such, I would rather tell you as little as possible and have your professional view on things”

At some point during his explanation the commander had looked at Da Vinci as well, which in turn had read the mood and had gotten closer to her researcher comrade, both of them taking the full seriousness of the commander’s words, nodding in turn and feeling like there shouldn’t be anything else to add to that, they nodded knowingly and went back to setting up the equipment that the rest of the personnel was moving from the vehicles.

 

They hadn’t quite finished the equipment arrangements when more vehicles arrived. On the first one, the commander could see Pennsylvania at the wheel, which meant that truck was the one escorting doctor Bethencourt. On another one, a truck for transporting materials and goods, he could see Akashi on the passenger seat, which meant that that particular vehicle had to have the most intriguing equipment they would be testing, the commander could always put the figurative money on Akashi being the one closest to anything that could be monetized in some way. The vehicles transporting people had stationed close to the one he had been in, while the truck had been put in front of the command tent, Akashi being the first to come out with one of the visiting Valkyrie coming right behind her.

“Commander this is so great, we get new things to experiment with and new friends to help us too, \~nya!”

Akashi said that last part while signaling to the Valkyrie who had come along with her, Buggy, the red-haired leader of the small group of Valkyries that had joined them on the mission to oversee Doctor Bethencourt’s facility.

“Ah! Good morning, Commander Anderson” The Valkyrie saluted to him and stood in place for a while.

She had stood that way with everyone looking at her, at that moment the commander recalled that the Valkyries that had come with them seemed to be rather stiff when it came to usual military conduct.

“At ease, Buggy” He said, crossing his arms, thoughtful “Has anyone given you any sort of trouble about rank or conduct?”

“Eh?! N-no, Commander!” The redhead replied, seemingly about to salute again.

“Mm? ok, then. Please remember, you are a guest and a friend here. Albeit we might ask for your assistance on certain things, it will be more in accordance to asking for a favor, rather than an order.” He informed the redhead, her brows now knit together as she seemed to be chewing on those words.

The commander was hopeful that their Valkyrie guests could feel comfortable enough before they left the base, he wasn’t completely sure if all Valkyries were so inclined to follow strict military protocol during a mission, and he really hope they just behaved more freely when in their own time. He wasn’t an expert on how the official Valkit branch worked, but he knew from firsthand experience that the Kansen would go above and beyond, and even accomplish feats that were considered impossible, as long as they had a fair work-life balance. They had much more intense personalities than most people and any unbalance or concern in their lives seemed to also weight them much more intensely.

The rest of the people had by now gotten out of the vehicles and assembled by the portable command post, the commander took a good long look at everyone present to weight their options and what could be done and what needed to be explained.",0,1730084497.0,AzureLane,0,0.5,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq

1gdsehg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gdsehg/i_finally_know_what_finding_your_other_half_in_a/,"I finally know what finding your other half in a partner, in a healthy way","This is literally me just gushing about my partner, and it’s going to be long. I just have to put it out in the world that I’m the luckiest girl in the world.

We met through a coworker. He used to work with her and was still buddies, she decided to set us up.
There are so many reasons why we wouldn’t have met. We live in completely separate counties, would never have me on dating apps or run into each other otherwise. It was such a coincidence and such a small chance we would even meet.

When my coworker gave us each other’s numbers-I was going through it. Just ended a situationship, and was going through a weird living/roommates environment. I was just not in a great state of mind, but I knew if I didn’t at least go on a few dates with him my coworker would not let it go. 

We didn’t even click the first few dates in my perspective, first date jitters and awkwardly trying to get to know each other, but small jokes and little flirts from me that would make him blush made me want more. I loved getting to know him and see his personality more and more. I don’t know what it was, just had a feeling to keep seeing him. 

Now, can’t even imagine what my life would be like without him. I know it cliche, but I can’t. I don’t want to know where I would be. I wouldn’t be this happy, I wouldn’t feel this safe, I wouldn’t feel this loved. We had a first year a few weeks ago but it’s been the easiest year while in a relationship despite the hardships. My family loves him, he makes me so fucking happy. Genuinely a walking green flag. From day one of spending nights together he’s cooked for me, even have a small album for all the meals-that’s if I remember to take one before I dig in. Got a cold coffee brew thing for me. I’ve never had a partner who would cook for me. From opening all the doors for me, to helping me pay for my dog’s surgery/vet visits and driving for nearly an hour to spend time with me.

I’ve had this toxic trait of mine, where I would be in a relationship and compare exes against them. I don’t do that anymore because they don’t even come close to him. He’s just my love, my best friend, my other half. I loved all my past partners, but too much, so much that I ignored right red flags- but I’ve never been able to say they’re my best friend. That if they weren’t my partner I would be fiends with them. That title is special and has only belonged to my sister-because no matter what I would choose her, and could tell her everything. I love my sister, and she still sits a little closer to my heart as well as my mother compared to him, nuts it’s pretty damn close. But I know, if we weren’t together we would be best friends- but I couldn’t help but have a crush on him.

The best part is, he’s never made me cry. Only happy tears.

I’ve always felt this way, but lately I get shown how lucky I am to have him, and for him to love me. My dog is having surgery and I’ve had to get a second job. He’s put in more than enough effort for us to spend time together, even if it’s for just two hours. He’s been extra gentle with me, and has literally gotten me a PC so we can game together since we’re not living together yet.

I could go on forever. To sum up-I’m marrying this man and spending the rest of my life with him, and I’d be stupid not to.",1,1730084396.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Crewed by 3 person team and small enough to fit on any landing pad,  Le Crapaud is a versatile option for any industrial operation. 

Sporting a 500 kg fuel load, Le Crapaud can get where it is needed quickly and effortlessly, boasting a jump range of 28LY.

(Optional mounted turrets are for point defence only.)

The interior is spacious, seating approx. 16 personell and outfitted with robust, durable seating. 
Forward facing docker complete with space suit and equipment donning area ensures the workforce lands ready to work, no matter the location. 

Passenger comfort has been accounted for with basic coffee/tea facilities and passenger toilet in the rear. In-flight entertainment is taken care of by 4 monitors (currently out of order)

Because let's be honest, most of you are out there flailing around like a fish out of water.

You see, the problem isn't with online dating itself. It's with the way most guys approach it. They treat it like a vending machine: insert a few coins (or in this case, a half-assed profile), press a button, and expect a delicious treat to magically appear.

**(Spoiler alert: It rarely works that way.)**

The truth is, online dating is a skill. It's a game. And like any game, it requires strategy, finesse, and a healthy dose of self-awareness.

So, if you're tired of striking out online, listen up. Here's how to turn your digital dating life from a barren wasteland into a thriving oasis of romance:

**1. Craft a Killer Profile**

Your profile is your first impression, your digital storefront. It's what separates you from the sea of other dudes vying for attention.

* **Photos:** Ditch the bathroom selfies, the blurry group shots, and the photos where you're wearing sunglasses and a hat. Invest in professional photos that showcase your personality, your style, and your best features. (Pro tip: hire a photographer who specializes in dating profiles. They know how to make you look your best.)
* **Bio:** No more generic clichés or boring lists of hobbies. Craft a captivating bio that tells a story, highlights your unique qualities, and sparks curiosity. Think humor, intrigue, and a touch of self-deprecation.
* **Prompts:** Most dating apps have prompts or questions you can answer. Use these to showcase your wit, your intelligence, and your unique perspective.

**2. Master the Art of the Swipe**

Online dating is a numbers game, but that doesn't mean you should swipe right on every woman you see. Be strategic, be selective, and be discerning.

* **Quality over Quantity:** Focus on women who genuinely pique your interest. Read their profiles carefully and look for common interests, shared values, and a spark of attraction.
* **Craft Engaging Openers:** Forget the generic ""hey"" or ""what's up?"" Write personalized messages that show you've actually read her profile and are genuinely interested in getting to know her.
* **Keep the Conversation Flowing:** Ask engaging questions, share interesting anecdotes, and use humor to keep her entertained. Be witty, charming, and slightly unpredictable.

**3. Assume the Sale (Without Being a Jerk)**

This is where most guys stumble. They approach online dating with a sense of desperation and neediness, which is a major turn-off for women.

* **Project Confidence:** Believe in yourself and your value. Assume she's already interested and focus on building a connection.
* **Take the Lead:** Don't wait for her to make all the moves. Suggest fun dates, initiate phone calls, and take charge of the interaction.
* **Close the Deal:** Don't be afraid to ask her out. Be direct, confident, and specific.

**4. Consistency is King**

Online dating is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires consistent effort and a long-term perspective.

* **Stay Active:** Log in regularly, swipe on new profiles, and keep the conversation going with your matches.
* **Keep Your Profile Fresh:** Update your photos and bio regularly to keep things interesting.
* **Don't Give Up:** Online dating can be frustrating, but don't throw in the towel. Keep refining your approach, learning from your mistakes, and putting yourself out there.

**The Bottom Line:**

Online dating can be a powerful tool for finding love, but only if you use it correctly. So ditch the half-assed profile, the generic messages, and the desperate vibes.

I am still heartbroken over this but I want to move forward.

After this breakup, a friend of a friend who I had turned down before asked me out last week and we went on a chill coffee date. Then yesterday I got drinks and ice cream with him. He’s very kind and friendly to me but I don’t feel an attraction to him yet. He’s a nerdy engineer type, we have similar interests but he’s not physically the type I would usually go for. I think he even wanted me to come up to his apartment but I awkwardly just went home instead because I didn’t want to do that. I don’t know if it’s because I’m still hung up on this other guy and I feel lonely or I just don’t find him attractive. I’m not writing off attraction to him as I sometimes feel like I could be what they call “demisexual” even though I don’t want to label myself.

My entire life has been a total shit show. Raised by abusive parents, father was an abusive narcissist, we should have been removed but weren’t, failed by multiple agencies etc. sister died of a seizure at 22, father died from a heart attack etc. first serious relationship ended by my ex who I have two sons with, due to his ptsd after being assaulted working in law enforcement. Next relationship, I fell pregnant, ex tried to convince me to terminate, I couldn’t do it, he walked away, my daughter has never met him. When she was 4 months old, I met my most recent ex partner. I was in the depths of post natal depression etc. and boom, I fell pregnant. We were using protection. I went to the doctor to confirm, had my first scan, and when I thought I must have fallen pregnant (condom broke, morning after pill), turns out I was ALREADY PREGNANT. Yes I understand this sounds insane, I’m sure he did something to make this happen. Anyway, as soon as I was pregnant, the nightmare of this man began. He became violent, stopped coming to my house of a night and was just plain mean. I begged him to treat me better. The entire pregnancy I was very sick with preeclampsia and bed ridden, my daughter was born premature weighing only 5 pounds. 3 months after she was born, his behaviour became more abusive. One afternoon, he became angry because I wasn’t listening to him, I was listening to my son instead and he drove erratically, parked us in the middle of a tsection, screamed at me etc. I told him to take us home, he did.. then he got out of the car and started to smash up a car seat and threw my coffee. All of the kids were terrified. He ended up leaving, broke up with me a week later. I respected his decision. He came back multiple times to collect his things, each time he destroyed something at my house. I never said anything. The final straw was when he came here unannounced and stole my car that was in his name. This was after he forced me to sell the car in my name and kept the money from it. He also brought two friends with him when he broke in. Tipped my underwear drawer over my daughter to find the keys. The police came, told him not to come back here and to bring my personal belongings to the police station, he refused, said everything was his.. they argued and said my wallet clearly isn’t... The next day he tried to convince me to let him come here to drop my belongings out of the car off, I was scared and declined. The only item he took to the police station was my wallet. My friend reached out to him to get my items, he only dropped off three things to her, he still has atleast $1000 worth of my belongings. I ended up getting a FVO on him, he turned up to court unrepresented. He used the conference we had later, as a way to further abuse me. Demanded to be allowed to come to my house and take items such as the fridge, microwave and vacuum cleaner.. we now have an order for a further year. I have heard from him twice. Once, to try and get me to meet with him to see his daughter. I believe this was a trap to show I didn’t need protection. I did not meet up with him, I am still terrified of him. He has not made any contact since, didn’t reach out for her birthday or Christmas. He was seen 4 weeks after with the mother of his other child, who is as bad as him, I was gobsmacked. The things these two have done and said to/about each other is unbelievable. He has been seen with her multiple times since, they’re clearly together. 

I have left a lot out, but basically, this man and the men I’ve been with, have all reflected back to me wounds from my childhood, I’ve actively sought out men who are like my father.. and the first and last ex, financially destroyed me. 

So here I am, a year later. I’ve worked on myself. I’ve lost a lot of weight. I’ve worked on my self concept. I am healing wounds from my childhood. I’m now medicated for ADHD/anxiety/depression, my life is 100 times better. I understand that I’m breaking generational trauma. I truely believe my kids are meant to be here and they are the loves of my lives. 
I’m very lucky that I’ve always had an amazing group of friends that have taken care of me during this time. What my most recent ex did to me was the wake up call I needed and what has strengthened my relationship with god/the universe. 

Everyday, for the past year, I have seen angel numbers everyday. I see eagles, butterflies, dragon flies, daily.. I know I’m aligned with my soul purpose, but I’m not seeing movement on my manifestations.. 

I’ve recently joined a dating site, and I cannot connect with anyone on a deeper level, this has never been a problem for me in the past. I rarely click with anyone, and I’m yet to meet up with anyone. 

I’m also not seeing any movement with financial abundance. I’m not able to go back to work, as my youngest is unable to attend daycare due to her poor health. I also don’t have any family to rely on, my friends also work and have young kids. I feel stuck. I’ve entered lotteries, but nothing has eventuated. I don’t understand how to feel more positive about money when my ex financially destroyed me and I can’t go back to work yet?

My ex is extremely wealthy, multiple properties, cars etc. he had 6 cars at the time he stole mine. I’ve avoided taking him for a settlement, as I don’t want to attract his negative energy or give him any kind of contact. I trust the universe will look after my kids and I. 

Does anyone have any tips to help me manifest? I use SATS, affirmations and subliminals every night. I’ve also improved my self concept, it’s the best it’s been my entire life.

I have good days and bad days. It’s been hard being a single parent to 4 kids, one of which having major health issues. I wouldn’t change it though. I just want to be able to provide for my kids and give them what I never had. I’ve taken responsibility for my circumstances and accepted what has happened. 

I’d appreciate any positive advice. If you’re here to roast me, you have bigger issues than mine. 

I apologise for any confusion/being unclear/typos.. I’m trying to get my child to sleep and she is unwell.

1gdror2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barnesandnoble/comments/1gdror2/a_love_letter_to_yall/,A love letter to y'all! ,"I moved to the US in 2018 (to Texas, from Belgium) I wasn't so much of a book reader back then and I was very lost in life. I knew of B&N but again I wasn't a book girlie. After a couple years I moved to Ithaca in the State of New York and gained more independence to go around on my own. I started reading too. Back then I was dealing with a big burn out following a job situation, I was more and more introverted and started seeing ""autism-like symptoms"" (I use that terminology because I haven't officially been diagnosed but when I research the subject I connect a lot with the ""criteria""). When I started going out in the wild by myself B&N was the only store I felt at peace and was comfortable enough to get out of my shell and do basic things like ask a question to an employee. B&N stores are the only stores (for the most part since not all are identical) to have quiet comfortable floor to walk on (oh you wouldn't know how that matters), low music, and lights not too bright. My autism-like symptoms are very much focused around my 5 senses so you can't imagine the world of a difference it makes walking into a Barnes & Noble versus any other store ever!! The fact that not everything I'm looking at (floor, wall, shelves, etc.) aren't white helps me not feel like everything is too bright, cold, foreigh and overwhelming. 

I want to give a special shoutout to the Barnes & Noble in Ithaca and all their employees. This was really my happy place while my husband was studying in Law School (the whole reason we were in Ithaca). I'll always remember that one day I walked into the store right around opening and it was so quiet I whispered to order my coffee because the employee was whispering. haha The employees have always been so lovely and helpful! I also want to mention this event that happened a couple months ago: I was sitting at a table in the coffee shop section and this tall guy walks up to the spot where the coffees are served. He seemed in great distress and I don't know if he was loud or if the store was quiet (although it was busy) but I heard the whole exchange. He told the employees that he had just gone to the bathroom and that he saw some ""bad words"" on the walls and he was really concerned, didn't know who to tell and that they should be removed, etc. He was kind about it, just overwhelmed. Probably at the same time, the employees and I realized this person was most likely atypical. The reaction of the employees was a masterclass of kindness and understanding! This was so out of nowhere that I'm sure a lot of people would have just said ""yeah yeah we'll take care of it"" and give him a weird look. But they understood right away! I could tell the employees wanted to calm him and were reassuring him that those words were not ok, apologized that he saw them, and thanked him. Their kindness in that moment seriously brought me to tears! 

I'm writing all of this because I came across this subreddit by accident one day while searching something about the rewards program and I read your posts often. I see all of you and I hear all of you and I wish corporate would realize how important your well being at work is sooo important to the customers. We don't want you guys in uniforms (please wear your fave outfits!), we don't want you micromanaged and underpaid!! 

You truly have no idea how for some of us this store is the only way we fight our social anxiety and get out of the house. Especially for someone who has moved as much as I have and I know wherever I'll go in the US I'll find a B&N to calm myself. I'm now in New Jersey and I'm still looking for what will be MY forever  Barnes & Noble but so far all the ones I've visited have been lovely! This store is the only big chain store that still feels like home. If anyone from corporate ever reads this please keep that in mind! 

To all of you, thank you for what you do. You truly don't know how much you impact people's days with something as simple as a cup of coffee and a book! ",17,1730082008.0,Barnesandnoble,2,1.0,False

I have almost fully recovered and just wanted to share my story and how Ive managed this disease likey my entire life.  I suspect I had it all my life but because I was a picky eater and knew the feeling I'd get when I ate a trigger (almost a burning sensation) and constant salvation/needing to spit with nausea, I always avoided those foods for the most part and thought nothing of it.  It wasn't till the beginning of this year when I went through the hardest semester of grad school and I had multiple painful impactions that resolved themselves that problems arose. After that I went almost 2 weeks barley eating anything scared and confused why food always got stuck in my throat also causing me to spiral into a depression and lost 20lbs.  My Mother a nurse practitioner prescribed me short term steroids that helped me for a week so I could eat a little before my scope.  My first scope however came back negative with only 5 eosinophlis (because of the systematic steroid I took to help me short term).  The doctor however suspected eoe still due to my rings and symptoms so I went on Pantroprazal 40mg twice a day.  The ppi didn't help me much and only made the little reflux I had worse. What really helped me was fixing my poor college kid diet of coffee, chocolate, and other acid inducing foods down.  Anyways I eventually got scoped again 3 months later with some improvements and now not on any steroids I got my official diagnosis.  At that point I switched PPIs to Omeprazole 20mg twice a day and weened myself off as I had bad side effects from trying multiple ppis that never even helped me.  Also Tums for some reason always gave me shortness of breathe and is probably a trigger for me somehow?  During  this entire time I did an elimination diet eating only beef chicken rice few vegetables and mustard which was literally my only safe foods it seemed as my triggers seem to be nuts fish dairy wheat legumes peas many fruits polen honey corn stevia/artificial sweetners and processed oils. This helped a ton but it wasn't till I tried antihistamines that I could eat almost anything I wanted with little to no symptoms.  Specially I've been taking childrens liquid benadryl with food I know is a trigger and also take a pill and my symptoms just disappear.  I know this isn't good longterm though and more a bandaid but I switched to a new gen antihistamine (zyrtec) daily and since then I've gained back 20 lbs and am practically my normal self again.  I also read on this reddit that the SLS chemical may cause EOE and my toothpaste/handsoaps did have it so I now also use literally just baking soda mixed with water to make it a paste and use that and yes it still works just as good. For soap I just use alcohol/hand sanitizer and Dr. Sasquach as it doesn't have any SLS in it.  I also have the ability to try dupixent but because antihistamines are working for me, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" I'm putting that on hold.  Hopefully this may work for some of you or may not as everyone is different but just wanted to share my ongoing recovery.  I think the biggest cause of this disease is stress, dry environments (lived in Colorado entire life and no one else in family has this) and eating triggers.
