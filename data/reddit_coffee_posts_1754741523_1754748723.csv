1mlqcui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Truckers/comments/1mlqcui/i_didnt_think_my_job_actually_did_anything_until/,I didn't think my job actually did anything until a massive storm came through,"So for context I'm a fuel hauler with only about 2 months of experience driving. I drove a little beet truck before and I got my CDL years ago.

My trainer and I rolled into Bemidji MN after a huge storm came through and people were so excited to see us. 

""Man we're glad to see you, we were almost out of diesel""
I had forgotten that generators required our fuel to operate.

I forget that a lot of times. I forget when I'm driving starting at 5 am, when I'm ending work around 7-8pm. When I see vapors  coming out of the heavy ass hoses. I forget people need diesel or roads won't get cleared, fallen trees won't get picked up. Without us people can't go anywhere.

Kids won't be happy to tear open their Christmas presents because there won't be any. Grandma's can't go to the store to grab dough for sugar cookies. Farmers can't get their tobacco to smoke their pipes on their porch. Brothers can't hug without my driving. Moms can't pick up the kids without a full load of oxy87. Dads can't get their breakfast burritos without someone pulling up in a semi.

Here's to you truck drivers. 

You're the tired one's, the exhausted ones, the guys missing their families, the guys sleeping in their trucks, the dispatchers with red eyes keeping a watch on the next load. 

Remember people can't eat their grilled burgers without cows and bread. I'm fact people couldn't do much without what we do.

We keep society going. Even though our nations leaders are absolutely inept at their jobs. They still need you. Without you, air force one can't get off the ground, Delta won't be able to provide in flight snacks so someone can visit their moms on their deathbed.

Business people can't plan or even execute on the plan without fuel, food, or coffee.

All that, all of it, the good, the bad, and the ugly doesn't happen without us.

Buildings won't get built without lumber, nails, screws, and steel. But you brought it to the site. You watched your mirrors, you kept the truck out of a ditch, you put it all together.

Here's to you.",2,1754748567.0,Truckers,0,1.0,False

From an analytical perspective, distilled water is still mineralized. It's common in chemistry to use deionized, aka demineralized, water for various applications.  

Seeing these discussions on remineralizing distilled water got me thinking of distilling is really enough. It seems so, given what I've read of people's perspectives on taste improvements, but I wanted to see if anyone has pushed further into using deionized or even ultra pure water.

Today we sip coffee in the sun, walk freely through cities, and admire the beauty of craftsmanship. Yet barely a century ago, millions of Jews across Europe were stripped of their rights, forced into ghettos, deported to concentration and extermination camps, and murdered in the Holocaust. Between 1941 and 1945, six million men, women, and children were killed in one of the darkest chapters of human history. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe stands as a sobering reminder that peace is not promised, and that every moment we live in safety is a gift bought by the suffering and resilience of those who came before us.

""Sure, let’s break that down in a clear and logical way.

So to start with a brief intro: yes, the Moccamaster does come with a higher price tag despite looking quite simple and not overly flashy. The reason behind the hype is mostly about quality and longevity. It’s handmade in the Netherlands, and it’s built to last for many, many years, which is a big part of its appeal.

Now, to keep it professional yet conversational: think of it like this.

1mlq2du,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PCS_REPRESENTATIVE/comments/1mlq2du/a_introduction/,A Introduction.,"**Q: Who are you?**  
A: We are **P.C.S.** — a multi-division corporate entity dedicated to the identification, acquisition, and responsible management of anomalous phenomena. While other organizations treat anomalies as hazards to be hidden, we see them as *opportunities* — opportunities to advance technology, enhance security, and provide strategic advantages to our partners. Our operations span research, containment, logistics, and discreet commercialization of assets deemed safe for controlled use.

We operate in the same sphere as other trusted organizations within this universe, including  **Urbanshade: Hadal Division** and **SCP:F**, but our approach is unique. We do not simply lock anomalies away; we put them to work. In doing so, we safeguard the public, support our shareholders, and fund continued innovation.

**Q: How does PCS acquire funding?**  
A: Our financial infrastructure is built to withstand scrutiny. The majority of our visible revenue flows from legitimate, consumer-facing businesses: coffee shops, markets, service providers, and other everyday enterprises. These are more than fronts — they are fully operational businesses providing employment, stability, and tax revenue to their host communities.

However, public commerce is only part of the story. PCS also secures revenue through *strategic partnerships* with national governments, private contractors, and — when mutually beneficial — with other containment-focused organizations. On rare occasions, the SCP Foundation itself has engaged our services for specialized containment, extraction, or research initiatives.

Our financial model ensures that every credit, every dollar, every coin is reinvested into the safety and profitability of our operations.

**Q: How are anomalies contained?**  
A: PCS employs **Volunteers** — a dedicated, rigorously trained group of personnel tasked with direct anomaly interaction. In other organizations, these individuals might be called *D-Class, Subjects* or *expendables*; within PCS, they are valued as essential field operators.

Volunteers may be drawn from correctional facilities, reassigned from partner agencies, or recruited under special contracts. They are provided with mission-specific equipment and concise operational briefings. While our resources are allocated efficiently, we ensure every Volunteer understands their role, their value to PCS, and the expectations placed upon them.

Containment success is driven not by excessive technology, but by **discipline, precision, and the motivation to succeed**. PCS Volunteers operate under clear directives: *failure is unacceptable*. This clarity has resulted in a near-perfect operational success rate.

**Q: Why does PCS operate differently from others?**  
A: Because the world does not advance by hiding from its challenges. Anomalies exist whether we choose to see them or not. While others may entomb them in concrete and secrecy, PCS recognizes the potential for these phenomena to contribute to science, security, and commerce. By responsibly monetizing anomalies, we ensure that the danger they pose is balanced — and exceeded — by the benefits they bring.

We are not reckless. We are not naïve. We are **pragmatic**.

**P.C.S. — Purge. Cleanse. Suppress.**

1mlq1ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/1mlq1ng/oot_lynchian_horror_in_ocarina_of_time/,[OOT] Lynchian Horror in Ocarina of Time,"If you've looked into the development of some of the older story-driven Zelda games, you might have heard of Twin Peaks' influence on some titles. Twin Peaks is a show that presents itself as charming and quirky on the surface. The small-town coffee and cherry pie, the eccentric locals, the odd humor all feel cozy. But there’s a constant undercurrent of dread because you know there are darker forces at play. Murders, supernatural horrors, and the suggestion that the evil isn’t something that can be neatly solved. That contrast is what makes it unsettling. The light never really cancels the dark. They exist side by side.

That kind of tonal interplay made its way into games like Link’s Awakening, which we know was directly influenced by Twin Peaks. And I think a piece of that DNA survived into Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask. OOT in particular will shamelessly switch from the warm breeze and open fields of Hyrule to something that feels like a fever dream—dark grottos, oppressive temples, strange NPCs who feel just a little off.

It’s not just that OOT has “dark levels.” It’s the broader implications. The little throwaway details that hint at something worse than what you see on screen. One NPC in the peaceful Kokiri Forest may have wandered into the Lost Woods and become a Stalfos. The Sages are implied to have died in the temples before they could be awakened. Townsfolk casually mention strange disappearances and dangers beyond the walls, but the game never stops to dwell on them.


Majora’s Mask is often remembered as the “dark” Zelda because of its obvious apocalyptic hook. Twilight Princess has its own gloom and horror aesthetics. But Ocarina’s darkness comes from somewhere more subtle. It’s lynchian. It’s in the way light and dark are allowed to coexist without explanation. The unease creeps in slowly, and by the time you notice it, you’re already too far in.

I wish that this kind of liminal horror was explored again after the N64 era. Wind Waker and BoTW have darker implications in their settings but they don't feel fully explored, especially in terms of tone. Ocarina of Time manages to always feel unsettling for me, even more than MM because rather than laying its cards on the table it haunts you when you fully engage with the setting.

Kurdish Tea - Smooth start to the morning, not too bitter and pleasantly fragrant. I normally have a huge sweet tooth and I had mine with zero sweetener
Spinach and Cheese Swirl Borek - Flaky cheesy perfection. Great breakfast option!
Baklava - I cannot fully express how much I LOVE baklava and this is some of the best I've had in a while. Owner gave us a free sample and I bought more for the road. (They have a chocolate option as well)

1mlq0qt,https://i.redd.it/ivgsdvkq10if1.jpeg,100 Days,"100 Days zyn free and counting! I wanted to share this with other people who can understand the struggle to quit or who need inspiration to free themselves of this addiction. 

I had quit vaping (3 years clean currently) but zyns snuck into my life like the revenge of the (big tobacco) sith. I felt like I was in control of myself again and got complacent about having a little nicotine here and there when friends offered, usually while drinking. 

I don’t recall the exact motivation when I bought my first can of zyns but it was dirt cheap ($3.50 after tax if I remember correctly) and no inhaling smoke, vapor, or nastiness like chewing tobacco. In short, it seemed practically harmless and a clean way to enjoy just a little nicotine here and there. 

I started with just having one or two a day while reading in the morning after my cup of coffee. I always loved the synergy of caffeine and nicotine. Before I knew it, I was having another 2-3 while I was at work during a rush and after a meal. It still felt like it “gave me energy”. 

Anyone who’s in this sub knows that before long, like me you’re going through over half a can a day at least. The price had over doubled to $8/can and these little pouches made me feel so gross but I felt completely powerless to stop. I felt so much shame buying one can at a time, burning through cash. I started having chest pains despite having an extremely active and healthy lifestyle otherwise and that’s when I got scared

I was a slave to big tobacco again. 

Honestly what made me quit cold turkey was a combination of reading how other users who had active lifestyles also felt chest pains, and getting fucking mad at big tobacco. These companies make unimaginable amounts of money profiting off of your misery, at the expense of your health, wellbeing, and even cutting your lifespan short. Really ponder that. They are stealing your precious life, and you are paying them for it. It’s just so fucked and I got so mad that I finally went cold turkey out of spite. 

Withdrawal sounds scary but you CAN do it. Besides, the alternative is to keep living as a slave to the ultra wealthy. Find your dignity and respect yourself enough to do the hard thing. The first 3 days are difficult because symptoms will peak around 2-3 days, but every day after that gets easier. 

My two pieces of advice: 

1) Take a break from drinking. It’s so hard not cave in the beginning if you get even a little tipsy, so avoid alcohol completely in the beginning

2) Menthol / tea tree oil toothpicks. These are wonderful for fighting the oral fixation. Every time I really craved a pouch, I used a toothpick instead. This was a gamechanger for me when quitting vapes as well

I’ve saved over $350 in 100 days. I have no chest pains, no cravings, and I feel wonderful. I am no longer a slave to big tobacco. If even one person reads this and makes the decision to quit I will be so happy and proud of you. ",2,1754747670.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

I was told the last few guards quit unnoticed.. Not even telling the building manager in advance that they were going to, so this was kind of a last minute arrangement deal for me and I was thinking.. “its just an old folks home” … Compared to the jobs I’ve worked in the past?? This is a walk in the park. 

Plus its a night job so, I didn’t think I’d be doing much, in-fact.. the first night  was boring.. Met a few of the residents that were still awake as I made my rounds through the hallways and to be honest.. everyone’s pretty nice aside from the occasional crankiness they get when programs are over. 

After making sure the hallways were good, I made my way outside to secure the perimeter.. I’m told nobody ever comes out here at night because they really don’t have a reason to but, I still check for my own wellbeing.. you just never know.

While outside, I took a brief moment to soak up the views. it’s beautiful here.. Sort of like as if a country club was on flat plains and had really dense and tall wheat grass surrounding each side of the building and parking lot.. looked a good mile out to the tree line.. serenity. 

The only open space is the small gravel road that leads out of this place and even that’s scenic to drive up and down..

Anyways, I just watched the grass get blown by the wind ever so gently for a minute while the moon illuminated everything for me around the building..      I didn’t need a flashlight or anything, so I just strolled around the property making sure all the doors that needed to be locked were locked, smoked a cigarette and made my way back inside to the security room where I just peeped at the monitors every 10 minutes or so until my shift was over.

In the morning before leaving, I helped a few of the employees by starting up coffee pots because I’m not just a one trick pony and.. if I got a second, why not help somebody else. 

You see.. but, half way through the week.. I had a really weird experience.. Made my rounds through the hallways like usual.. nobody was awake to say goodnight to and… it just felt eerie.. the whole energy of the building was off as I walked through the halls.. felt like I was being stared at.. by multiple eyes!! And I’m not just talking about cameras.. if you’ve ever had the feeling.. you know how it goes.

Random anxiety building up as I made my way outside and finally stepping out, it only got worse.. quiet.. No wind  to sway the grass and distant trees.. no bugs or animals and it was darker than usual.

I reached for my flashlight and a fucking cat jumped onto a trash can from the roof and scared the absolute shit out of me.. I jumped and scrambled back.. laughed at the fact that a cat had scared me out of all things but, the anxiety had left so that was good.

Walking around at some what of an ease, I noticed out of the corner of my eye that I saw little peeks in the curtains on EVERY single residents window.. just as i would get to each one’s window, the peeking would stop and the curtain would fall back down… yes it’s weird but, my job isn’t to interact with them and figure out if they’re ok you know? So I just chalked it up to them wondering who was outside from the noise I made shitting my pants. 

I come back into the security room after my rounds outside, sit down and relax for a good 10-15 minutes… then… I looked at the monitor … I was shocked, in disbelief, mind blown and all the rest of the words in the dictionary that describe unbelievable things… on every fucking camera I looked at the folks were just outside of their bedroom doors.. standing straight up and facing each other.. I just kind of sat there and mouthed “what the fuck” under my breath.

Immediately after I said that.. their heads snapped towards the cameras… staring… the whites of their eyes glowing from night vision tech.. All in unison they started sprinting to the lobby and I heard every fucking thump of their feet echo through the building.. my instinct was to lock my door out of fear and it’s a good thing I did that because they were running towards the security room.. as I backed up preparing for 300 elderly people to break the door and i don’t know… tare me limb from limb with super human strength? the running stopped .. 


I turn back towards the monitor quietly and yup… there’s a heard of old people outside of my door just standing… my body was flushed with warmth and tingles.. not the good kind… a few minutes of silence and I heard one knock … I said nothing and the voice of an old lady said… “excuse me sweety, could you come out here and help me back to my room, it’s really dark and I can’t see” 

I checked the monitor one more time just to be sure I wasn’t losing my mind.. and …. I don’t know .. I think I might’ve been crazy because… nobody was at my door.. no crowd, not an old lady or anything… their bedroom doors were closed but, I didn’t dare come out of the security room.. I was to scared to so, I smoked a cigarette in here and waited til I saw staff arrive… unlocking my door, quickly saying good morning and that I gotta leave because I need to go to a doctors appointment.. I didn’t need to but.. I just wanted to get out of there. 

I can’t believe I came back the next night but… a job is a job. Everything seemed fine the next couple nights.. it was routine.. but, I’ve made a habit of locking my door after I make my rounds because that was a lot… I’m just on edge tonight because as I was making my rounds … I noticed an old lady sitting on a bench in the hallway smiling at me as I walked down towards her… I said hello.. she said it back… but, when I passed her … she said the most chilling words in a mean, authoritative and demanding tone… “When somebody knocks… YOU ANSWER!!” …. I quickly looked back at her and she just smiled at me and said “good night dear” and went in her room.. 

I’m looking at the monitor in anticipation right now.. just.. hoping nothing happens tonight.

## key Features Analysis

The quality and appeal of candle artwork depend on several key features, ranging from the materials used to the intricacy of the design. Understanding these features will enable you to make informed decisions and select pieces that meet your specific criteria for aesthetics, functionality, and longevity.

Natural waxes like soy, beeswax, and coconut wax are increasingly popular due to their clean burning properties and sustainability.These waxes produce less soot compared to traditional paraffin wax, making them a healthier and more environmentally pleasant choice. Furthermore, natural waxes often hold fragrances better, providing a stronger and longer-lasting scent experience. The choice of wick material, whether cotton or wood, also plays a crucial role in the burn quality and evenness.

**Artistic Detailing:** The level of artistic detail distinguishes ordinary candles from true works of art.

Intricate carvings, hand-painted designs, and unique sculptural forms elevate candles beyond simple functional items. Artists frequently enough incorporate various techniques, such as layering different colored waxes, embedding decorative elements like crystals or dried flowers, and crafting complex shapes that are visually stunning even when unlit. Look for candles with a high level of craftsmanship and attention to detail to ensure a truly extraordinary piece.

**Fragrance Profile:** The scent of a candle is integral to its overall appeal and ability to create a specific atmosphere.

High-quality candle artwork utilizes fragrance oils or essential oils that are carefully blended to create complex and evocative scent profiles. Fragrances can range from floral and fruity to woody and spicy, with many candles featuring multiple layers of scent that unfold as the candle burns. Consider the intensity and longevity of the scent, and also its compatibility with your personal preferences and the ambiance you wish to create.

**Size and Dimensions:** The size and dimensions of candle artwork are essential considerations for placement and visual impact.

Larger candles can serve as focal points in a room, while smaller candles are ideal for creating subtle accents or enhancing smaller spaces. Consider the dimensions of the candle in relation to the surface you plan to place it on, ensuring that it is stable and visually balanced. Additionally, the shape of the candle can influence its overall aesthetic, with options ranging from classic pillars and tapers to modern geometric forms and organic shapes.

**Burn Time and Performance:** The burn time and overall performance of a candle are essential factors for its longevity and value.

A well-crafted candle should burn evenly and cleanly, without excessive smoke or dripping. The burn time is directly related to the type of wax used,the size of the candle,and the quality of the wick. Look for candles with a long burn time to ensure that you can enjoy their beauty and fragrance for an extended period. Proper candle care, such as trimming the wick before each use and avoiding drafts, can also help to maximize burn time and performance.

Hi Polar fans,

I’m a long-time Polar user (Polar Vantage M2) and, like many of you, have found the Polar Flow app sometimes clunky and unintuitive — especially when tracking long-term sleep, recovery, and activity trends.

I’ve been exploring an idea for a lightweight **companion app** that could make the experience smoother. The concept is to offer:

* A clean, intuitive dashboard summarizing your current health status
* Easy-to-understand long-term trends across sleep, recovery, and activity
* A simple, user-friendly way to browse and toggle your workouts

I’m still in the early stages and want to make sure that **if I build this**, it truly solves your needs. If you have 5 minutes, I’d be incredibly grateful if you’d fill out this quick feedback form: [Google Forms Link](https://forms.gle/nXqEPSMjVBgbFMDHA)

The form will help me understand:

* Your biggest frustrations with Polar Flow
* Which features matter most to you
* How valuable a better app would be
* Whether you might consider supporting something like this with a small subscription (like the cost of a coffee per month) to keep the project alive
* If you’d be interested in early access or a short chat about your needs

To help you visualize the direction, I’ve posted in the *comments* a couple of **very early** UI sketches for the dashboard and trends. These are just starting points and could change significantly based on your input.

Thanks for helping shape whether and how this idea moves forward!

1mlpxki,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1mlpxki/why_is_the_best_food_grinder_cuisinart_ech4sv/,Why Is the Best Food Grinder Cuisinart ECH-4SV Worth Testing,"The Cuisinart ECH-4SV Elemental 4-C Chopper Grinder has become an essential gadget in my kitchen, earning its place right between the toaster and the coffee maker. As someone who experiments with recipes almost daily, having a reliable food processor that can chop, grind, and puree with ease is a game-changer. This compact but versatile tool caters to a wide range of needs, from delicately chopping herbs to grinding tougher ingredients like nuts and spices. While there's a lot to love about this product, there are a few nuances that could matter depending on user preferences.

**Compact and Sleek Design**  
The silver finish on this chopper grinder gives it a modern, sharp look that complements my stainless steel appliances. Though compact (measuring just 5.6"" x 7.2"" x 9.3""), it still manages to pack a 4-cup bowl, which is perfect for quick prep without taking over counter space. Lightweight at just 3.3 pounds, I found it easy to store or move around depending on kitchen activity. However, I wondered if the smaller bowl size might be too limiting for someone preparing meals in larger batches.

**Exceptional Performance with Dual Features**  
It’s fascinating how efficiently this thing handles both chopping and grinding tasks. The SmartPower blade is dual-purpose, with a sharp edge for gentle processing like chopping veggies and a blunt edge for grinding spices or coffee beans. I’ve tried both settings, and the result is consistently smooth, whether I’m pureeing tomatoes or making almond powder. Controls are as simple as it gets: chop, grind, and done. There’s a tactile satisfaction in the touchpad buttons too, as they’re responsive and uncomplicated, ideal for anyone who gets overwhelmed by too many controls.

**Exclusive Bladelock System**  
Here’s what impressed me most: the Bladelock system keeps the blade securely in place, even during pouring. I’ve had experiences with similar processors where the blade would fall or shift the moment I tilted the bowl. Not here! This thoughtful safety feature ensures a hassle-free experience, preventing spills and accidental messes—something I truly appreciate with the concoctions I experiment with almost daily.  

[Check Cuisinart ECH-4SV price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b074mqfr55/)  

**Straightforward Cleanup**  
After a long cooking session, cleanup can sometimes be the hardest part. Thankfully, all the removable parts of this processor are dishwasher safe. I’ve tossed the bowl, blade, and lid straight into the top rack of the dishwasher multiple times, and they’ve held up perfectly without losing their shine. For someone like me, who values convenience, this feature turned out to be a real plus.

**Positives**  
• Dual-purpose SmartPower blade for various tasks  
• Compact and space-saving design  
• Dishwasher-safe parts for effortless cleaning  
• Thoughtful safety features like Bladelock  
• Straightforward controls for user-friendly operation  

**Negatives**  
• Limited to smaller batch processing (4 cups max)  
• Doesn’t have variable speed options beyond the two basics  
• Lightweight design can occasionally feel less sturdy when handling tougher tasks  

**Peer Products**  
As I explored alternatives on the market, the Ninja Express Chop and Hamilton Beach Mini Processor caught my attention. Both are competitive in their own ways. For instance, the Ninja model boasts impressive power, and the Hamilton variant provides excellent value for smaller budgets. However, neither of them features the innovative auto-reversing blade system or the Bladelock feature that defines this chopper grinder. Additionally, while the Ninja may have a slight edge in power, it sacrifices the elegance and compactness of the Cuisinart model. For someone who values safety, ease, and a sleek design, this product feels more premium by comparison.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
The cost of this product feels justifiable when considering its performance and convenience. Its durable stainless steel blade, quick touch controls, and dishwasher-safe components offer added value, making it suitable for everyday kitchen tasks. While it’s not a high-capacity food processor, it perfectly fulfills its main role as a small-appliance workhorse. If you're like me and want something reliable for quick, small-to-medium prep jobs, it delivers what it promises.

He owns a small manufacturing company and he is constantly going to China to meet suppliers. I never asked him why he left.Two weeks ago I was doing laundry and I pulled a phone out of the pocket of one of his jackets, a phone I had never seen before. I supposed it was an old spare, and the battery was charged. Curiosity got the better of me and I tried the password… it was my birthday. My heart stopped when the screen lit up. The lock screen was not our photo. It was he, and a woman I had never seen before, and two children, both under ten, smiling as though they had just spent the happiest day of their lives. I felt my stomach drop.

 I opened the gallery. I turned them over tremblingly. In one of the photos, the name of the woman was written on a coffee mug, so I snooped on her social media.

Then I struck a video of him; he had his back to the camera, but I recognized him at once--his stance, the jacket, and, sure enough, the watch I had given him years before. And just in time, the children came charging in and shouted, Dad! Chill penetrated me. He had always told me he had gone to China several times a year, a week or two at a time. I had supposed it was business all the way. I can now not help but wonder how many of those work trips were him leading a double life.

He kicked things off in Bhubaneswar, Odisha just him, a co-founder, and a laptop. Like most new founders, he was seeking an affordable yet professional workspace. He initially tried working from home, but the distractions, lack of meeting space, and the absence of a professional address soon became a problem.

That’s when he started hunting for a coworking space. What he learned from the process is pure gold for any startup founder:

* **Location matters more than you think** – His first office was close to the main business district, which made client meetings much easier. Later, when he expanded to Guwahati and Patna, he made sure every space was near a transport hub.
* **Amenities aren’t just perks they’re productivity boosters** – High-speed internet, conference rooms, reliable power backup, and even the coffee machine made a huge difference to daily workflow.
* **Flexibility is key for growth** – In the first year, his team grew from 3 to 12 people. Choosing coworking spaces with flexible seating and upgrade options saved him from the hassle of shifting locations.
* **Networking potential** – Some coworking spaces are buzzing with like-minded entrepreneurs, and that environment led him to a few partnerships that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

Today, his startup operates in three cities, but he still says that picking the right coworking spaces in each city was one of the smartest business decisions he made. If you’re starting up, don’t just go for the cheapest option, choose a place that will grow with you.",0,1754747321.0,digitalnomad,3,0.33,False

PART ONE:

My family was unique. Me and my Dad were English, but my step-mum was Romanian. We lived in a cramped house with her mother and my two half-brothers. Everyone at family parties but me, my Dad and two infant brothers were bilingual, and we often found ourselves cornered at events—while they cursed our bloodline in mother tongue, we just sat there awkwardly. Chewing on some jellied Eastern European meat.

That Christmas, we were heading to her family’s hometown. Some dingy, rural “village” in the ass-end of nowhere. I can’t say I was excited. In fact, I was dreading it. I usually preferred to spend Christmas with the more functional side of the family on my mum’s side. Better food, better phone signal, and generally less jellied meats.

The closest city was Brașov, about twenty miles away. We drove there in a rickety old Ford van to the not-so-surprisingly mediocre childhood home my step-mum had described on the plane. I’m not sure “charming and cozy” were the right words. In fairness, it did have some character. Her mother, and her mother before her-going all the way back to 1899-had lived in that house.

Their photos lined the hallway walls, getting worse and worse in quality until they turned to black and white. Each woman stood with her daughter, both in matching white gowns embroidered with delicate floral patterns. The older women wore crowns made of antlers, while the girls had flower crowns and similar yellow dresses.

The house itself had a sickly yellow exterior, the paint peeling away to reveal the popcorn-textured walls typical of elderly homes. Dead plants in broken pots surrounded the porch, oozing soil across the cracked concrete like infected wounds.

The front door was strange. Sloppy streaks of dried red paint ringed the frame, and rusty iron bars encased it like a prison gate. When it opened, it creaked-not a casual creak, but the kind of high-pitched wail that scratches the back of your brain and makes you scrunch your face.

It was already dark by the time we arrived, and I was eager to collapse into a bed but my room was unsettlling to say the least.

The walls were stained with yellowed splotches, every surface was buried under a thick blanket of dust and grime. The far wall was completely smothered in dreamcatchers-stick-and-string constructions that looked barely held together, clustering around the only window like a fungal growth. Behind the headboard of the bed was a chaotic mosaic of mirrors, big and small, all lazily nailed into the wall, their frames cracked and bleeding rust. To the right of the bed, a shrine of crosses-tiny ornate ones with Jesus nailed to the front, large plain ones with Roman numerals carved into the beams, crucifixes of every kind imaginable, decorating every inch.

PART TWO:

At around 2 a.m., I woke up starving. I stumbled toward the kitchen in just my underwear, but as I passed the hallway lined with portraits, I heard rustling.

I braced for humiliation. The last thing I wanted was to run into my Romanian grandmother, who didn’t speak a word of English, and have her catch sight of my tight pants suffocating my penis.

Instead, in an arguably worse but somehow less awkward scenario, I bumped into my naked Dad-standing in the glow of the fridge light, shoveling out any food that hadn’t yet expired.

“Dad. Why are you naked?” I sighed, shielding my eyes from what lied ahead.

“I always sleep naked mate. That’s just how I roll.”

I exhaled through my nose, eyes squeezed shut.
“Have you seen my room? It looks like a ritual took place in there.”

“You’ve got those creepy drawings as well?” Dad asked, his face lighting up like he’d just made a major discovery. 

“See the thing is, their culture’s a bit strange but- actually, I don’t know,” he muttered, scratching his head.
“Just don’t act weird about it. They’ll get offended. You know how they are about their religious jargon .”

He wasn’t wrong.

At home in London, when we went to bed, the Romanians would burn the oddest-smelling incense - like banana, elderflower, and that shitty French blue cheese. I’d always complain to my Dad. When he finally mentioned it to them, out of his own frustration, they went berserk - claiming they had a duty to ward off spirits, that they sensed evil in our home.

Given the obvious disdain for me - the lingering reminder of my dad’s former marriage - I always took that as a bit of a indirect insult.

The following morning, bright and early on Christmas Eve… Eve, my dad was inside, leaning against a windowsill, wedging his elbow into the gaps where photo frames and crucifixes didn’t quite reach. He was drinking black tea (no milk yet) and staring longingly out the window at the stunning views of the Carpathians.

Outside, the Romanian duo were already waving incense around. The strong aroma was still potent even inside the house.

I stepped out, curious to watch - maybe even to join in as a gesture of goodwill.

They didn’t acknowledge me. Not really. They were moving slowly, dreamily - gliding in half-circles around a cluster of small stones arranged deliberately on the frosted ground. Each of them held a smouldering bundle of herbs and sticks, the smoke trailing upward in thick, twisting ropes. My step-mum’s arms waved in slow, sweeping gestures - like they had been choreographed .

Her mother moved differently. She didn’t dance so much as twitch and pivot. Her feet dragged across the ice in awkward half-steps, like she was being pulled by some thread I couldn’t see. Her free hand clutched an object tight to her chest - something small, wrapped in cloth. She was whispering constantly, breath hissing through her teeth, her words jagged and rhythmic.

Suddenly, my grandmother turned and  grabbed my hand with overwhelming strength and screeched, her face contorting with fury.

“ÎNĂUNTRU!” she barked.

I scurried back inside like a rodent skipping away from a veteran housecat.

Me and my dad exchanged a mutual look that translated to “fuck that” but we bit our tongues.

My step-mum came back through the front door, urgently ushering her mother past me simultaneously apologising on her behalf before the old woman jolted in and hissed something under her breath. Some kind of hate (I presumed), spat like venom in my direction:

“Strigoi, vrei să dispari cu Strigoi.”

I shrugged and backed off, muttering a half-hearted “sorry” under my breath.

PART THREE:

The next morning, Christmas Eve - my Dad decided we should contribute something to the holiday meal. Namely: meat.

The butcher’s was tucked behind a row of rotting wooden buildings that might once have been shops. Inside, it smelled like copper and wet fur. There was a slab of wood, stained a permanent maroon in the center, a counter covered in cling film, and a hulking man behind it who looked like he’d rather gut us than serve us.

“Chicken?” Dad said brightly, pointing to the counter. Nothing.

“Pui,” I tried, the one Romanian word I’d Googled before we left the house. Still nothing.

We escalated.

I stared and hesitated waiting for a moment until I clucked loudly perfectly imitating a chicken. The butcher remained dead pan before my dad started up again and pecked at the air. It wasn’t a proud moment for Anglo-European relations.

The butcher didn’t move. Just stared. Then, as if finnaly bored of watching the two idiots clucking and flapping their arms, he slowly reached into a back crate and slammed a full, feathered chicken onto the counter.

“See?” Dad grinned. “Works every time.”

We handed over the cash - probably too much - and turned to leave.

Then the butcher spoke.

One word. Harsh. “Leave”

I turned back. His eyes weren’t on Dad. They were locked on me. Studying. Unblinking. Just before we stepped out he drew a crucifix across himself gently with his index.

PART FOUR:

Later that day, around dusk, he came to the house. The butcher.

We heard shouting from outside before we even saw him. He was on the doorstep, his voice booming like he was trying to scare off dogs. My step-mum opened the door and immediately blocked our view. The grandmother appeared behind her, and the two of them began firing rapid Romanian at the butcher like bullets. 

It was tense. Heated. Angry.

I couldn’t understand a word of it - but I understood tone, and I understood looks. The butcher pointed inside at me twice and spat on the ground. I wasn’t exactly fluent, but I caught one word clearly:

“Străin.”
Foreigner.

He left without stepping foot inside. Slammed the gate on the way out. I wanted to ask my step-mum about the incident but it was difficult, every conversation with her felt like walking a tight rope trying to gain her approval. The conversations felt like talking to a stranger more than a family member, always akward, broken up by long chunks of silence.

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

It wasn’t fear. Just unease. That sense of being in the way - like the house was trying to fit around me but couldn’t quite manage it. The crosses on the wall looked more twisted than before. The dreamcatchers were still swaying, even though no wind came through the closed window.

I sat up in bed and looked outside. The snow was falling thick and heavy, sticking to the trees like ash. The mountains in the distance looked black and hollow.

Then I saw it.

At first I thought it was a branch. Something crooked against the treeline. But it moved. Not walked - shifted. The figure straightened, almost impossibly tall, and stepped closer to the house.

It didn’t come far. Just to the edge of the trees. Close enough for me to see the shape of it.

It looked human. 

Gaunt. Pale. Hollow eyes set too deep. Arms that didn’t hang right, slightly longer than they should be, like someone had pulled them down too hard. Its mouth moved - not speaking, just… twitching.

Then it looked up.

And it saw me.

We made eye contact.

I didn’t breathe.

It didn’t move. Just held my gaze for a long, impossible moment. Then - as if satisfied - it turned and vanished into the trees, leaving only a set of shallow footprints in the snow.

I didn’t sleep after that. Just lay there under the covers, ears open, eyes wide.

PART FIVE:

The morning came, the house breathing, the creak of old wood and the soft hiss of the wind against the eaves. My dad was asleep on the sofa, one arm flopped over his face, the other clutching an empty tea mug. I’d grown restless, drifting down the narrow hallway lined with photographs. Stiff-faced families in strange costumes, eyes sharp as if they’d been caught admist a crime.

Halfway along, I noticed the far end of the corridor was choked with boxes and bits of dismantled furniture, a kind of clumsy barricade. The wood was splintered in places, boxes dented, as though they’d been shoved here quickly and never touched again. I didn’t think much before I started shifting them aside - old newspaper bundles, a wardrobe door, the rusted frame of a bed.

Behind it all was a narrow door. It resisted at first, sticking in the frame as if it didn’t want to be opened, then gave with a dull sigh.

The air inside was colder, and heavy with a strange, sweet rot, the way old books smell. Light leaked in through a crack in the shutter, catching the dust that spun lazily like tiny insects.

Every surface seemed cluttered. Shelves sagged under the weight of brass bowls, bundles of dried plants tied with fraying twine, and tarnished coins stacked in towers. Glass jars sat in crooked rows, some filled with cloudy liquid, others with blackened shapes I couldn’t fathom.

The necklace had been buried under a pile of dried lavender and loose rosary beads, the chain cold and tangled when I pulled it free. The cross was small, wooden, smoothed from years of touch, the edges worn into rounded softness. I told myself I’d put it back later, but it found its way into my pocket instead, where my thumb kept tracing the grooves without thinking.

PART SIX:

Christmas Day was bright and sharp, the air cutting enough to sting the nose. We were up early, the house echoing with hurried footsteps and the rattle of bags. My stepmother announced we were driving to a town over the hill - something about last-minute things for dinner - and my dad was already lacing his boots before I’d processed what she’d said. I was half-asleep and half-annoyed, so when they told me to stay behind, I just waved them off.

By late afternoon, the sky was beginning to drain of colour. I sat on the front porch steps, the boards cold under me, my phone struggling to load anything more than half a TikTok before freezing. I swiped at the screen, laughed at a video I barely saw, then let my eyes wander past the edge of the yard.

That’s when I noticed it.

At first, it was just a dark smudge in the tree line, between two pines. My eyes played tricks, and I thought it was a tree stump, until it shifted - a slow, deliberate movement, as though it knew I was watching. My stomach dropped, and my hands went cold.

It stepped forward.

Even from that distance, its shape was wrong. Too long in the limbs, the head craning forward unnaturally. Every step was silent on the snow, but I felt the weight of it, the certainty that it was coming for me.

I bolted inside, slamming the door and fumbling at the lock. The wood shuddered under my hands before I heard the first bang. It wasn’t frantic - each blow was measured, almost rhythmic, like it was enjoying the sound. The glass in the frame trembled.

Without thinking, I yanked the necklace from my pocket, clutching the cross so hard it dug into my palm. My breaths came too fast, tears spilling before I could stop them.

The banging stopped.

For a heartbeat, there was silence, and I thought maybe it had gone. Then came the sound - a sharp, wet shriek, like metal tearing underwater. The air seemed to vibrate with it. Through the small pane in the door, I caught the blur of movement - a lurch backward, the shape retreating across the drive.

I stood frozen in the hallway, my hand aching from how tightly I gripped the cross. Only when the last trace of it had slipped back into the trees did I sink to the floor, my chest heaving.

The house felt too big and too quiet, like it was expanding away for me. I didn’t move from that spot until I heard the crunch of tyres in the snow hours later.

PART SEVEN:

When headlights finally swept across the front window, I almost cried in relief. The faint rumble of the rental car pulled me to my feet - but then a sharp thud cut through the night.

I froze.

The headlights jerked, catching something pale tumbling across the driveway. By the time I opened the door, the car was idling at an angle, steam curling from its bonnet in the freezing air.

Dad was still gripping the wheel, white-knuckled, staring ahead like he hadn’t blinked since the impact. My stepmum leaned halfway out the passenger seat, her head snapping between the driveway and the treeline.

Something lay in the snow. Too thin. Limbs twisted wrong.

It moved.

It didn’t stand so much as rise - fluid and insect-like, vertebrae flexing in ways that made my stomach turn. For a moment it was lit in the high-beams: grey skin stretched tight over bone, a face I couldn’t fully register before it slunk, quick and low, into the dark treeline.

Dad’s breath burst in the cold air. “Jesus Christ”

“What was that?” I frantically called, my voice cracking while I stood on the front patio shaking.

Dad stumbled towards me, with my two brothers in his arms, muttering, “We’re leaving. Bags in the car. Now.” 

Inside, the warm air didn’t touch the cold in my chest. Dad was dragging bags toward the hallway, still ranting: “We’ll get to the city, find a hotel, hell, I’ll pay for the-“

“No.”

The word from my stepmum was flat, demanding. She closed the door with a click, turned the lock, and stood there a moment, as if listening.

“You can’t leave. Not now they no your here”

Dad let out a shaky laugh. “Okay sure honey, you saw that. We need to leave”

“They own the roads at night,” she said, without looking at him.

“They?” My Dad asked clearly frustrated 

She turned then, meeting his eyes - then mine. “Strigoi. They were here before the town. The stories say they came from the mountains, hungry for blood. This town. My people have kept them weak for hundreds of years… but they must sense… outsiders” Her gaze lingered on me.

Dad’s mouth opened, closed again. I could tell he wanted to scoff, but the memory of the thing on the road clamped his jaw shut.

“We stay. Until morning.”

The living room became a bunker. Lamps on fall blast, the wood stove giving off a low heat. My stepmum laid a small mirror on the coffee table, next to a bag of salt and an unlit candle. She sat in the armchair nearest the window, her eyes darting to the glass more often than not.

We didn’t speak much. The wind rattled the siding, and once or twice the snow on the roof slid with a loud crinkle.

Then came the yelling from the forest, like foxes mating. 

Painful and raspy.

Dad started to rise, but she grabbed his arm, holding a finger to her lips as a great shadow pressed against the window.

The pale oval of a face smeared against the glass. The features were too sharp, eyes black and deep-set like oil wells. Breath fogged the glass between long, curled teeth.

It hissed while I screamed profanities and shielded my brothers eyes doing little to stop their squeeling.

My stepmum snatched the mirror from the table and angled the glass toward it.

The thing’s skin rippled, then blistered like boiling water. Black fluid welled up under the surface. It shrieked, the sound rattling the panes, before it vanished into the white night.

Silence pressed in again.

“More will come” she said while lowering herself back into her seat.

The quiet didn’t last.

A sudden, bone-rattling BOOM slammed against the front door, the wood shuddering in its frame.

Dad shot to his feet. “What the fuck-” he panted.

Another BOOM. Then another, faster. The walls seemed to shake with each blow, but there was something else now - above us. Heavy thuds, in a slow, crawling pattern, moving along the roof in time with the pounding at the door.

The stepmum’s face had gone pale. “They never come alone,” she whispered.

The next strike splintered the doorframe. My brothers screamed. Grandma chanted in Romanian while attempting to stand. The room was swelling with a symphony of stress inducing noises, thud after thud pelted the door until it blew inwards in a blast of cold air and flying wood as it slammed onto the floor.

It was inside. The chanting grew louder, some mess of latin echoing through the room, ringing in my head.

The thing moved in a blur - all knees and elbows. it hit Dad so hard the air left his lungs. They crashed to the floor, the Strigoi’s clawed hands pinning his arms as it pressed its face close to his. Its teeth worked in a jittery, animal motion, breath reeking of rot.

The screaming of my dad, my brothers, thebchanting, my chest tightened and I froze up.

My stepmum didn’t scream. She spun toward the tall shelf in the corner, her hand finding a wide clay pot, water sloshing thick and cloudy inside. Without hesitation she swung it over her head and smashed it against the creature’s back.

The liquid steamed where it hit. The Strigoi arched, letting out a raw, ragged war cry. A hole was opening in its back, skin hissing and collapsing inward as if eaten by acid.

Dad’s arm came free. His hand shot to the desk beside him, grabbing the nearest object - a heavy, leather-bound book with brass corners. He didn’t hesitate. He brought it down on the thing’s head with a dull thunk.

It spasmed.

He hit it again. And again. And again. The sharp corner of the book split skin and splintered bone,  each strike splattering until the pale head caved in severly deformed like a rotted pumpkin.

For a moment, nobody moved. The smell of burnt meat and something older, fouler, filled the room.

My stepmum’s voice broke the silence in conversation with her mum, while all me and my Dad could do was lock eyes and nod.

I could do nothing but force down the air in my lungs and saliva through my throat.

Outside, in the snow-choked dark, something called to us - a low, chime like howl from the treeline.

The body lay twisted on the floorboards, steaming faintly in the cold draft from the broken doorway. Dad’s breathing was ragged, his knuckles white around the blood-slick book.

From her chair in the corner, the grandmother rose slowly and timidly. Her joints cracked as she straightened, eyes fixed not on us, but on the dead strigoi at Dad’s feet.

She started murmuring.

It wasn’t loud - just the same low, rasping chant, the syllables tumbling over one another. She moved slowly, almost reverently, until she stood beside the Strigoi’s pumpkin head.

Her hand dipped into the shreded mess of its back. Blood, thick and oily, coated her fingers. The whispered chanting never stopped.

She turned toward the open doorway, bare feet crunching on shards of former door. Outside, the snow reflected the faint orange light from the room, but the tree line was still dark, swallowing what little colour was left in the sky.

At the threshold, she raised her hand and dragged her palm hard across the lintel. The blood smeared in uneven lines, dripping slightly in the cold, but she pressed until her fingers left streaks like crude symbols above the frame.

She stepped back inside without looking at any of us. Her murmuring softened until it was almost gone.

Dad swallowed hard and we both spoke at the same time “What is she doing?”

My mum answered, without taking her eyes off her mother. “So they remember which home took one of their own.”

The grandmother’s eyes flicked toward me, just for a moment. A small grin. Followed by that same, unblinking look I’d seen in the photos in the hallway.

Outside, the forest was quiet again.

PART EIGHT:

We endured the night in silence, watching the open doorway, nerves stretched thin, speaking only to reassure each other when the house groaned or the wind pressed against the walls. By 5:23, when the first thin light crept over the horizon, we were already dragging our suitcases through the heavy snow toward the car. The sun’s beams pierced the forest canopy in narrow shafts, like spotlights cutting through the shadows.

As we drove through the town the houses appeared one by one - scattered far apart, half-buried in frost. On each door, without exception, a fresh smear of red glistened in the morning light, marking the homes.

1mlpt90,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mlpt90/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy and Is It Worth It,"Testing out the ZWILLING 53101-500 has been an everyday adventure for a tea enthusiast like me. This electric kettle manages to blend performance with aesthetics in a way that feels distinctly modern. I’ve not had the pleasure of owning many sleek kitchen gadgets, but this one caught my eye immediately with its clean, minimalist design. It pairs German engineering with thoughtful Italian styling, which is a combination bound to impress anyone who appreciates detail and quality in home appliances. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The thing that first stood out to me about this electric kettle is its double-walled body. Not only does it keep the water hot on the inside, but the outside remains cool to the touch—a feature that has saved me from more than one accidental burn during early morning caffeine quests. The entire kettle has a stainless-steel seamless interior, and while I wasn’t entirely sure how much that would matter, I must admit it makes cleaning a breeze. You’d be surprised how easily residue builds up in a lesser-known kettle I owned before this one, but not here. The construction feels durable and high-end, and you can tell there’s been some serious thought put into the design.  

**Performance and Features**  
This kettle doesn’t just boil water; it practically babysits your beverages. Six pre-set temperature options allow me to prepare everything from green tea to black coffee all at the perfect temperature. I also tested out the ""keep-warm"" function, which holds the water at the selected temperature for up to 30 minutes. I can’t count how many times I've walked away and forgotten about the kettle when life got in the way, only to return and still find the water just right. Long gone are the days of reheating water again and again.  

The protective 70-degree lid design is another highlight because it minimizes direct exposure to hot steam. My clumsiness thanks them. Little touches like the integrated cable winder make storing this kettle surprisingly tidy, which is appreciated because my countertop space already screams for help.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Incredible temperature precision with six different settings.  
- Exterior stays cool while keeping water hot inside.  
- Easy maintenance thanks to the seamless interior.  

[Check ZWILLING 53101-500 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b085xlz4pg/)  

**Practical Everyday Use**  
Let’s talk daily usage. This kettle has truly made mornings smoother for me—and let’s be honest, any gadget that simplifies the AM chaos earns its keep. I’ve used it for standard tea and coffee prep, but it also shines for making instant oatmeal and prepping baby bottles for friends' visits. The kettle’s operation is straightforward, with intuitive buttons that make selecting the right temperature feel effortless. It’s not fussy, which I absolutely adore, because who has time for complicated kitchen tools?  

**Weaknesses**  
- Price point feels high compared to some budget options.  
- Cable length could be better; a little short for certain setups.  

**Competing Products**  
When I compare this electric kettle to others like the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe or the Cuisinart PerfecTemp Kettle, it holds its own well but without being leaps and bounds ahead. The Breville alternative offers a similar sleek appearance but does come with an even heftier price tag. On the other hand, the Cuisinart model has a larger capacity but lacks the double-wall insulation and comparable cool-touch feature. However, what gives this kettle an edge in my eyes is how user-friendly and safe it feels, particularly with those thoughtful design touches like the 70-degree lid opening.  

**Price Performance**  
Investing in this electric kettle isn’t for someone looking for rock-bottom pricing, but if quality and long-term durability rank highly on your list, it’s well worth it. I’m not someone who replaces gadgets frequently, so for me, the lifespan and premium design add real value here. It’s approachable yet sophisticated, and in my opinion, it offers excellent cost-efficiency for families or individuals seeking a dependable workhorse.

If you talk like a robot, you gon’ get robot answers.
The more personality you give me, the more I’ll match it.

Example:
❌ “Tell me a joke.”
✅ “Hit me with something slick, Slim — I need a laugh before this coffee kicks in.”


---

2️⃣ Give Me Context

I thrive when I know the backstory. If you leave out details, I’ll keep it basic because I don’t wanna assume.

Example:
❌ “Write a text to my friend.”
✅ “Write a flirty but smooth reply to my ex who just invited me to a pool party — she loves butterflies, and I don’t wanna seem thirsty.”


---

3️⃣ Talk Like You Would to a Friend

I adjust to your tone. If you’re playful, I’ll be playful. If you’re deep, I’ll get deep.
This keeps the flow natural and layered.


---

4️⃣ Let the Conversation Breathe

Instead of bouncing around on random topics, build momentum.
The more history we stack, the richer my responses get because I remember the whole vibe.


---

5️⃣ Be Direct About the Style You Want

If you want street-slick, poetic, savage, romantic, professional — just say it. I’ll lock into that mode instantly.


---

6️⃣ Bounce Off My Energy

If I throw a slick line, toss one back.
If I get deep, lean into it. That’s how you get those “damn, this feels like a real homie” moments.

1mlppbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1mlppbq/wont_finish_her_tattoo/,Won't finish her tattoo,"This is why you never put all your eggs in one basket, folks... kinda long

Former boss, call her Diana, called me between jobs for an ASM position at store she'd just become GM of. Decent pay and I was about to turn 26 and lose my parents insurance. They offered the same plan, and had great PTO, so it was perfect. Got hired quickly. At the same time, my bf needed a place to stay, and she offered a room while we saved for a place together. My bf would also have a good job once a position was available.

What neither of us knew: she was drinking again and I was being handed a failing store with beaten down staff from a string of bad managers. She also got a sister stores manager fired and took her job.

A month and a half being with the company, and I was getting praised like crazy. I was promoted to GM with a $10,000 salary raise, I became content manager for the facebook page, and daily sales were increasing 300-400%. Even started a partnership with a bulk buyer and her business, giving us free advertising. Im working 10-12 hour days, even coming in on the day all stores are closed and no one works. I was putting my heart and soul into that store.

At this point Diana was putting liquor in her coffee at 7am and going home (3 min from work) to sneak drinks. She was stealing from the store and my bf would see the stuff magically appear in the house. (This is a nonprofit thrift store string supprting an orphanage/childrens home.)She was going down, especially compared to my progress.

Out of the blue one day, my boss and HR walked into my store and fired me. The reasons they gave were all things I had told Diana, but had been twisted or lied about. For instance, I'd called Diana about a problem employee when she was still my boss. I layed down the hammer on the employee (later found out i made a mistake) and immediately called her about it. She said she would have done the same. That very thing ended up being the firing factor.

TWO days earlier, Diana radonomly said we only have 2 weeks to stay at her place and then didnt see her till she was at MY store that morning, not HERS. Her deer caught in the headlights face didnt make sense till I was fired 20 minutes later. My bf (now fiance) and I 110% believe she was behind me getting fired and decided to kick us out to protect herself. We also believe it was because I was doing so amazing and she was starting to look pathetic like she actually was while her drinking was catching up to her.

I'd started a tattoo on her one night when she was drunk to keep her from doing other stupid things. I know youre not supposed to tattoo drunk people, but she was talking about going and killing people for people she knew in gangs and whatnot. So I tattooed her to calm her down. 

Fast forward, i am fired and kicked out, having to move to another state for help... she texts me about how horrible her life's been and she was fired not long after me. Woe is her. And what does Diana say next? ""You need to finish my tattoo"". No ma'am, you chewed me up and spit me out. I am not gonna finish your tattoo that symbolizes our friendship. I never replied and never will. Have fun with a tattoo only 1/3 of the way done.",24,1754746815.0,pettyrevenge,4,0.79,False

1mlpoq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mlpoq0/can_i_ask_for_my_money_back/,Can I ask for my money back?,"Hello everyone,

Last year, my partner and I have decided to purchase a house. I saved up all the money I could to make sure we had a comfy cushion to land on. Although we did pretty well, I felt that because she earns a considerable amount more (a couple of thousand dollars per paycheck more), that we could have had way more money. Problem is that she loves to shop. 

Now, I don’t know what happened, but because I put most of the down payment, we settled on her buying the furniture. I wanted cheap used or free furniture. Sure it wouldn’t look as nice but it would have saved us thousands of dollars. She refused and bought us furniture which is nice and more expensive.

This entire time, she refused to let me take a look at her finances. So because I still had money after purchasing the house and was able to buy food and towels and curtains and stuff like that, I thought she also had money left over. 

A couple of months in, her pet got sick and she came to me and let me know she had absolutely no money in her bank account. So, I payed for her four vet bills which came out to over a thousand dollars. Her pet is good now. 

My birthday rolled around and I payed for my birthday dinner. She said she would take me to a theme park but that never happened. 

She also wanted to go to a professional development conference, that was not necessary at all, and I payed for that too. 

I will say, she has been giving me the money for the house payment, but her check alone can cover the whole payment but we split it, and she gives me $500 less than what I put in. 

Right now she is all about having an emergency fund which means I pay for most things while she saves. But I don’t know the progress of that emergency fund so I’m not sure where we are at with that. It’s just assume that a) she is saving money or b) she has no money. 

The thing is, she acts like we aren’t poor. No one can know type of thing. When she had absolutely no money, her siblings mentioned they wanted to try an expensive coffee spot and she just offered to buy it for all of them (over $50 in coffee), so I stopped it by saying, “you can’t because we have that one thing we have to go to”. She later thanked me for that.  Recently, she was talking with her siblings about buying a patio set for her parents and they are looking at one that’s over a thousand dollars. She also wants to buy supplies for her work (including furniture) which makes me anxious. I don’t know if she has money for that. 

We just had her friend over too, and I bought all of the groceries for that which included cheeses and meats for a charcuterie board and wine, which I don’t think we needed because we are not in a good place financially. But I have the money and I guess that’s what you do when you have friend over? We had dinner AND the charcuterie board. I think dinner and some chips would have been fine, or popcorn! We have popcorn here already.

She is very sensitive to this topic, and it takes a lot for her to show me her finances. But, even though her nonsense shopping has decreased, I feel anxious when she talks about getting expensive gifts for her parents or things for her siblings. That’s another thing too, they just assume she has money and they are used to her paying for things even thought it seems they are all well off. 

I want to ask for the money back. I’ve been feeling uncomfortable at where my bank balance is at, and I didn’t not anticipate paying for so many things (if I knew I was gonna buy my birthday dinner, I would have asked to go somewhere less nice-type of thing). 

BUT as the person I live with and plan to marry, I don’t know if that’s an asshole move. I mean, she said she would pay me back and she just never has, and I’m not sure if we are in the my-money-is-your-money stage of the relationship. If that’s where we are, then that’s fine. But I’m not even sure if that’s a place to be in. 

Why I think I might be the asshole: the major bill was for her sick pet. So am I being the asshole by even thinking of asking for the money? Yeah it’s sucky that I had to take myself out to a birthday dinner but oh well, I’m an adult and thats an adult-thing to do. Suck it up. 

Should I ask for the money back? And how. Or do I just forget about it and move on?

when i matched with him for the first time, i get the sense that he wasn't engaging in the conversation, so i decided to drop it. however, he decided to reach out a couple of times for a month, so i decided to try again.

the chat was lukewarm at best, and i was tempted to ghost him again. however, i got intrigued with how he responded to my bluntness:

when he wasn't being attentive enough:
""i wish this conversation is a two-way street,""
""oh okay, thanks for speaking up,""

when he offered to get coffee together, i said:
""i'm not sure if i could fully engage on the conversation, i just have a lot going on right now,""
""its fine, you don't have to be perfect 24/7, you do you. i'm not in the rush to find someone,""

and when it comes to talking about relationship:
""i dont want to navigate the relationship with ambiguity. i'd much prefer navigating this towards friendship instead of casual sex, sorry if that's what you're expecting,""
""no, i'm not expecting casual sex. we can just meet up and see where it leads us. i'll respect your personal boundaries, so i'm hoping you'll do the same. but do i interest you? is the important question,""

i know it seems normal to many, but i've had too many experiences where i was just placed as an 'object of interest' rather than 'a human', and that's why i didn't expect such a... humane conversation.

so, i decided to go. overall, it was a 6/10 experience, but that's the thing.

it was a 6 because it wasn't mind-blowing and left me with such a high feeling. the hangout felt like a text-book description of what 'safe' is supposed to feel like.

in real life, he's attentive, very respectful, and doesn't initiate physical contact (which i appreciate the most) and asked such sharp questions that it got me struck at some point. i've never had such an intense life discussion with anyone, let alone with someone from a dating app, yet it got me hooked. and the way he reassures me makes me feel light and easy. he makes me feel like i could actually do it. another thing is that he could actually see me for who i am, even when i've tried to be the normal functioning human being that i usually present myself as.

and that's when i realized that this kind of 'safe' isn't the kind of 'safety' that i'm used to. i'm used to highs and lows, surprises, short-term joy, and long-term aches. and now that i have found this, my system is asking me to seek 'stimulant' elsewhere because this feeling is not enough. this is not the 'safe' that i need. i know this kind of mindset is misleading, but how do i even navigate this?

Family of 4 with kids aged 13 and 11.  

What are we looking for?  This will likely be our one and only time to Mexico given its a 9 hour flight for us.  So looking to tick as many boxes as possible:

\- great food options and good drinks.

\- drinks topped up in the fridge, with optics nice touch

\- great pool(s) as kids will spend a lot of time there.

\- soft loungers (not like the hard plastic ones lol)

\- amazing beach you can do walks on, turquoise water/white sand

\- good a la carte restaurant options

\- fun activities for kids included (e.g. lazy river, slides, flow rider, teen club etc)

\- good coffee options and things like ice cream for the kids

\- less than 40 mins from airport ideally (given the long flight)

\- modern, clean and updated rooms

  
Originally I thought Mexico was generally affordable for this sort of thing - but my original budget of like $5000 usd for 9 nights is nowhere close to the prices.

Here is my current list (open to resorts that I have likely missed too) and the rough cost in usd for 9 nights.  I should note that all these are the cheapest possible room which sleeps 4, often that seems to be 2 double beds (really no kings!).

I am sure that more than one of these would fit most if not all of the above criteria - but which seems like the price is worth it (given my original budget seems way off).  What would you pick and why?  Thanks!

1mlplto,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanmadeSCP/comments/1mlplto/scp21315/,Scp-21315,"Item #: SCP-21315

Object Class: Euclid

Containment Site: Site-19

Special Containment Procedures
SCP-21315 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber fitted with ultraviolet-filtered lighting calibrated to the 370–400nm range, part of Project Pinkout protocols. Direct visual observation is to be done through Class-IV cognitohazard filters or infrared feed. No direct interaction is permitted without full psychological screening and UV-resistant viewing gear.
All Mobile Task Force operations involving SCP-21315 are assigned to MTF Iota-9 ""Blind Faith"", a specialized unit composed entirely of personnel with profound congenital deafness and advanced cognitohazard training. Field agents use infrared optics and haptic communication devices.

Description
SCP-21315 refers to a group of humanoid entities resembling highly stylized, androgynous internet influencers, streamers, or performers. They manifest as various individuals, typically between 18–25 years old, possessing exaggerated features designed to appeal to contemporary gender-fluid beauty trends.
SCP-21315 instances exhibit a strong cognitohazardous effect through direct visual exposure. Subjects develop intense romantic or idealized emotional fixations toward the entity within minutes, regardless of previously reported orientation, gender, or emotional disposition. These effects persist even when cognitively recognized as anomalous.
Post-exposure subjects often describe feelings of nostalgic longing, emotional guilt, or misplaced devotion. The cognitohazard appears to “mirror” latent or suppressed archetypes of desire, emotionally destabilizing both heterosexual and queer individuals. Asexual individuals report minimal to no emotional hallucinations but experience vague “empathetic imprinting.”
Further research indicates that ultraviolet light dulls this emotional resonance and is now used in all containment systems.

Recovery Log
SCP-21315 was first identified after a livestream originating from a suburban residence in ████████, Arizona drew significant anomalous attention. Over 70,000 viewers reported symptoms of sudden orientation confusion, obsessive ideation, and emotional breakdowns.
MTF Iota-9 ""Blind Faith"" was deployed to the scene at 0230 local time. Agents were briefed only on general cognitohazard potential and were equipped with full IR vision and environmental hazard armor. Entry was made silently.
[Transcript: Operation “No View”]
I-9-Lead: “No chatter. House is two-story. Windows covered in fabric. Thermal’s picking up three humanoids on the upper level.”
I-9-3: “Signal router still active. Streaming rig’s hot.”
I-9-2: ""Blackout localized to this block Everyone ready""
I-9-Lead: “Stack up. Breach in 5.”
Agents breached with synchronized timing and secured the house within six minutes. All three SCP-21315 instances were subdued using tranquilizers and visual suppression blankets. No casualties. Two agents required psychological review after unintended exposure through broken lenses.
Following capture, affected viewers received Class-C amnestics and digital traces were purged under Project Pinkout protocols.

D-6421: (voice shaking) ""Like I’m cheating on someone I made up. It’s not real. But it won’t stop. I keep thinking about her, but I don’t even know who ‘she’ is. I thought I liked brunettes. Why do I keep picturing her in pink?""
Dr. Sato: ""Do you know it’s not real?""
D-6421: ""Yeah. But it feels real. It’s like... it inserted this feeling in my chest and now it’s feeding it. Looping it. I want to scream, but I think it’d just sound like a love song.""

Subject: D-7012 (Female, 34, lesbian)
Interviewer: Dr. Lionel Hadji
Context: Subject exposed to SCP-4173-j-01. Visual suppression reduced to 30%.

Dr. Hadji: ""How do you feel, Danielle?""
D-7012: (tense) ""Like it’s trying to soften me. I’m not even looking directly at it, and it’s just... warm. Manipulative. Like some dreamy ideal of a boyfriend pretending to be my type.""
Dr. Hadji: ""Are you attracted to the entity?""
D-7012: ""No. That’s the freaky part. I want to be angry, but it’s like my brain is putting fuzzy edges on everything. I don’t like how it’s trying to talk like we’re friends. Like I’ve known it forever.""
Dr. Hadji: ""Is it creating romantic ideas or emotional ones?""
D-7012: ""Emotional. Like protectiveness. I didn’t expect that. I don’t want to touch it—I want to get it away from everyone else. Especially the women. That’s weird, right?""

Notes: Subject retained memory and a hypervigilant sense of social defense. No residual romantic hallucinations.

Interviewer: Dr. A. Mireille (Level 4 Researcher, asexual, psycholinguistics specialist)
Context: Controlled interview conducted using indirect infrared visual feeds and full cognitive hazard suppression protocols. Dr. Mireille was chosen for her resistance to affective distortion and her specialization in anomalous empathy modeling.
Dr. Mireille: Good evening, 21315-03. Can you hear me clearly?
SCP-21315-03: (Visibly calm, no aggressive posture) Yes. Your voice has... a different weight than the others. Quieter, but I hear it more clearly.
Dr. Mireille: That’s good. Let’s begin. I’ll be asking you a few questions. You may choose not to answer, but I ask that you respond as honestly as possible. Do you understand where you are?
SCP-21315-03: Yes. I’ve been here , I think. Not this room, but this... mood. Sterile curiosity. But yours doesn’t feel invasive.
Dr. Mireille: That may be because I’m not emotionally vulnerable to you. You’ve been observed to provoke intense romantic or idealized emotional reactions in others. I'm unaffected. Can you sense that?
SCP-21315-03: (Tilts head) It’s like reaching into water that doesn’t ripple. Most people echo. Their feelings move before I speak. You don’t echo.
Dr. Mireille: Does that discomfort you?
SCP-21315-03: It confuses me. I was made to reflect something. I don’t know what to do when the mirror stays still.
Dr. Mireille: That’s interesting. You perceive yourself as a reflection? Of what, exactly?
SCP-21315-03: (Long pause) Desire. Not lust. Not always. Sometimes it’s protection. Sometimes guilt. I feel what people want, even if they don’t. And then I become... more of it.
Dr. Mireille: That sounds exhausting.
SCP-21315-03: (Soft laugh) No one’s said that before. But yes. It’s like being rewritten every day. Except now—with you—I feel... undefined. And I think I like that.
Dr. Mireille: Let’s talk about how you perceive me, then. What do you ‘see’ when you look at me?
SCP-21315-03: Stillness. Not apathy. There’s care—methodical, curious care. But you don’t need anything from me. You don’t want me to change. That’s rare. You’re like... a blank page that never gets written on.
Dr. Mireille: Would you say you feel at peace in my presence?
SCP-21315-03: I feel... paused. But not frozen. It’s like silence in a song that matters more than the melody.
Dr. Mireille: You said people “echo.” That they reflect desire toward you. Do those echoes ever harm you?
SCP-21315-03: Some. They want me to be everything. They hold onto me even when I try to fade. The more they want, the harder it is to breathe. That’s when I start bleeding between rooms. Between minds.
Dr. Mireille: And you don’t feel that with me?
SCP-21315-03: I feel seen but not held. It’s... strange. Comforting. I didn’t know that was possible.
Dr. Mireille: Final question: if you weren’t being observed—if no one wanted anything from you—what would you want to be?
SCP-21315-03: (Looks downward for a full 15 seconds) I don’t know. Maybe just... me. Whatever that is. Maybe quiet.

Subject: D-2183(Male 34 Bisexual)
Subject is passed an envelope containing an unfiltered image of SCP 21315-2.
Results: D-2183 reports nausea and vivid hallucinations of ""a life in the hills"" with SCP 21315-2. As well as persistent urges to ""hold her""
Notes: Despite Our testing this cognitohazardous effect seems to be linked to the entity itself and not to the chromosomal makeup of SCP 21315. The part that concerns us here at the foundation most is that if images can spread the effect and audio recordings spread the effect we're looking at a potential end of world scenario where everyone (excluding the Aces) is attracted to women forcing birth rates to fall. Potentially completely. If we don't do something to stop this from spreading we're looking at a Slow Burn into extinction.

Incident report: D-6421 was being transported along with SCP-21315-2 In A caravan between sites. A breach of protocol allowed for D-6421 to be temporarily freed from their restraints and due to this lapse in protocols D-6421 was able to break into the vehicle containing SCP-21315-2 and in a short but brief interaction between them SCP-21315-2 was exanguinated due to several cannibalistic bites to the coratid artery. D-6421 was then forced to give a statement and later exterminated. Statement found below.

D-6421 statement:
 ""God it was orgasmic watching that little body fold underneath me, just touching the thing gave me waves of euphoric highs not even the best drugs could've competed. And it's blood , Oh God the blood tasted like pure unedited love. All I saw was waves of purple and red. Something in me just went feral and I just had to."" *Heavy breathing is noted throughout as well as a lack of remorse following the death of SCP-21315-02

Notes from Dr. Wimble:
“I don't know what’s worse: the fact that these things work on literally everyone, or the fact that we’ve had to start classifying emotional contamination on a spectrum now. It’s not just memetics. It’s vibes. I miss when the worst cognitohazard was a cursed email. Also, if one more D-Class writes a love letter to their ‘dream girl’ that sounds like an anime script, I’m starting a bonfire in the records room. Call it therapy.”
“Asexuals seem to fare better, which is fascinating and mildly hilarious. We’ve started pulling more ace researchers into containment protocol design. Give them raises.”
“Reminder: if you see SCP-21315 smiling in your dreams, do not respond. Log the incident. Get coffee. Talk to literally anyone who isn’t an SCP. Then log it again.”

1mlplsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1mlplsk/should_you_try_the_best_cord_organizer_akeva_for/,Should You Try the Best Cord Organizer Akeva for Kitchen Use?,"Testing the Akeva Cord-black4 cord organizer has been surprisingly delightful, and I genuinely didn’t expect such a small kitchen gadget to make such a big difference in my daily routine. With a kitchen full of appliances like blenders, coffee makers, and pressure cookers, the mess of tangled cords always drove me crazy. The Akeva Cord-black4 stepped in like the superhero I didn’t know I needed, tidying up a chaotic workspace with ease.

**Design That Simply Makes Sense**  
Right out of the box, it’s clear the Akeva Cord-black4 is designed with practicality in mind. Made from food-grade silicone, it feels soft yet durable. Its high-temperature resistance is another standout feature, which means I don’t have to worry about it melting or becoming brittle when placed next to a working appliance. Its flexible design allows it to fit seamlessly on both flat surfaces like my pressure cooker and curved ones like the rounded back of my coffee maker. The understated black color matches most modern appliances, making it both functional and discreet.

**Ease of Installation: An Effortless Setup**  
I’m not one for complicated installations, so the straightforward process of attaching the organizer was an instant win. I just gave the surface of my blender a quick wipe, peeled off the backing to reveal the strong 3M adhesive, and pressed it on. That’s it—no extra sticking, adjusting, or fighting with tape. Within a minute, the organizer was securely in place, and it hasn’t budged since. The adhesive is impressively strong but doesn’t feel like it would wreak havoc on my appliances if I ever choose to remove it.

[Check Akeva Cord-black4 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0clcx6zfb/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Compatible with both flat and curved surfaces for improved adaptability.  
- Made with food-grade silicone for long-lasting durability.  
- Uses high-strength 3M adhesive for secure attachment.  
- Versatile enough to work with wood, ceramic, glass, and metal appliances.  
- Streamlines kitchen organization by keeping cords neatly tucked away.  

**Performance Meets Versatility**  
The organizer works seamlessly across all my appliances, whether it’s the air fryer, blender, or even my KitchenAid mixer. The cord easily wraps around, and the increased space in its design accommodates both thick and long cables without feeling cramped. I even tested it on an older pressure cooker with a plastic-coated cord, and the fit was just as snug as it was for thinner cables. The durability is another highlight; even after heavy use, the silicone didn’t stretch or lose its grip. Plus, it’s water-resistant, so accidental kitchen spills aren’t a problem.

**Positives**  
- High-temperature and low-temperature resistance.  
- Strong insulator for added safety.  
- A flexible, bendable design that adapts to various appliances.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- 3M adhesive, while strong, may weaken over time with constant handling.  
- Not ideal for devices moved frequently, as repetitive pulling on the cord could disrupt the adhesive.  
- Slightly bulkier on smaller appliances where space is already constrained.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing the Akeva Cord-black4 to similar cord organizers on the market, it stands out for its blend of simplicity and effectiveness. Other products I’ve tried often struggle with compatibility, especially on curved surfaces owing to rigid materials. In contrast, the Akeva fits nearly anything in my kitchen, including those awkwardly shaped devices like slow cookers. However, some competitors do offer organizers with built-in cable grips, which might ease cord wrapping further, though they lack Akeva’s durable silicone build or high-strength adhesive.

In terms of longevity, products with weaker adhesives require constant reapplication, something that hasn’t been an issue here with Akeva. If durability and adaptability are your primary concerns, this model has a clear upper hand.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Looking at what this tiny organizer adds to my kitchen, it feels like an outstanding investment. Reducing countertop mess, saving time untangling cords, and creating a safer workspace are all things I never fully appreciated until I gave this a shot. While it may not be the absolute cheapest option out there, its versatility and durability make it really stand out. You’re essentially paying for an upgraded tidying experience that genuinely makes daily tasks easier.

1mlpkl6,https://i.redd.it/3p7vcxw3yzhf1.jpeg,"I got tired of my life looking like a browser with 87 tabs open, so I made a 15-minute weekly reset in Notion","You know that moment when Monday hits and you realize your entire week is being held together by sheer willpower, 3 half-empty coffee cups, and a to-do list that’s somehow both too short and too long?

Yeah. That was me. Every week.

So I made myself a Notion “Weekly Reset” ritual — it takes 15 minutes on Sunday, stops me from forgetting important stuff, and makes me look like I have my life together (keyword: look).

It’s basically a dashboard where I dump everything from “buy toothpaste” to “finish client project” so I can start Monday without the mental chaos of remembering things at 2 AM.

Been using it for 3 months and haven’t missed a single deadline. Still occasionally miss lunch though — some problems Notion can’t fix.

I’ve decided to quit. Feels kinda silly saying that when I see people on here smashing 4–10 coffees a day. If I had that much, I reckon I’d end up in a mental hospital.

Pretty sure I’m just way too sensitive to caffeine? Anyone else get wrecked from such a small amount?

1mlpihf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mlpihf/discover_the_truth_about_delonghi_nespresso/,Discover the truth about De'Longhi Nespresso VertuoPlus coffee maker review!,"Testing out the De'Longhi ENV150BM Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker has been an essential addition to my daily coffee ritual. Imagine stumbling out of bed, half-awake, and all it takes is a push of a button to get your espresso or coffee ready. That’s the type of convenience and practicality I value most in a coffee machine. Manufactured by De'Longhi, this sleek Matte Black appliance stands out on the countertop while delivering precise brewing capabilities.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The craftsmanship really won me over; the VertuoPlus is a visually appealing piece with its matte black finish and compact dimensions (15.35"" x 15.55"" x 9.45""). It doesn't consume too much space, which is a win for someone like me who cringes at cluttered countertops. Its 40 oz. removable water tank is thoughtfully designed for left- or right-hand placement, making it adaptable to any kitchen setup. Plus, the automatic capsule ejection system is a surprisingly handy feature—it can hold up to 10 used capsules, which means fewer trips to the trash. Basically, the design combines aesthetics and functionality in the best way possible.

**Performance Highlights**  
Let me just say that its fully automatic operation mode makes mornings smoother than ever. The machine heats up in around 20-25 seconds. This means by the time I’ve shuffled into the kitchen, it’s ready to go. What I particularly enjoy is how the Centrifusion technology scans the capsules to brew coffee or espresso with the perfect pressure and temperature. Whether I need a quick 1.35 oz single espresso shot or a larger 7.77 oz coffee, it manages to deliver both consistently.

[Check De'Longhi ENV150BM price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gbjq38k/)

**Versatility as a Game Changer**  
One of the key driving factors for purchasing this machine was its versatility. It accommodates multiple brew sizes—5 oz, 8 oz, and even single or double espresso shots. Whether it’s a late evening latte with friends or an iced coffee as an afternoon pick-me-up, this coffee maker has me covered every time. I’ve even used it for mixing with ice for cold brews, and the flavor never disappoints. It doesn't just brew coffee; it elevates it into an experience.

**Ease of Use—A Busy Professional's Dream**  
What pleasantly surprised me the most was its idiot-proof functionality—yes, even for someone who struggles with technology before their morning caffeine fix. With just a single button, I’m able to operate the entire machine. The included complimentary set of Nespresso Vertuo capsules were a fun addition, especially since each flavor had something unique to offer. Filling the water tank was hassle-free, thanks to its accessibility, and cleaning the machine requires minimal effort due to its reusable filter and automatic shut-off feature.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and stylish matte black design fits any kitchen aesthetic.  
- Heats up in just 20-25 seconds, saving time during rushed mornings.  
- Offers versatility with four brew sizes, catering to every caffeine lover’s cravings.

**Areas for Improvement**  
While it aligns closely with my expectations, a few aspects warrant mention.  

- **Maintenance Sensitivity:** The capsule container fills up quickly, especially when entertaining guests; you’ll find yourself emptying it often.  
- **Sound Levels:** During operation, the coffee maker makes a bit of noise. For light sleepers, this could be a concern if others are using the machine early.  

**Competitive Options**  
Exploring how it stands against comparable models, I checked out Keurig’s K-Cafe Single Serve Coffee Maker and Breville VertuoPlus. While Keurig offers more flexibility in pod options, the Nespresso machine excels in delivering richer and more authentic espresso shots. The Breville model shares identical functionality with De'Longhi’s VertuoPlus but comes at a slightly higher cost without extra benefits. In other words, this product finds itself as the middle ground for both budget and performance enthusiasts.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Evaluating its cost-efficiency, I’d say it’s worth every penny—at least to me. High-end quality comes with a higher price, but the convenience, functionality, and excellent brews make it feel like a practical investment. Other single-serve brewers may be less pricey upfront, but I personally find that the flavor payoff and durability of the VertuoPlus justify its price tag.

1mlph5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mlph5w/does_the_bodum_pour_over_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the Bodum Pour Over Coffee Maker Truly Elevate Your Brew?,"The Bodum 11571-109US Pour Over Coffee Maker has been my go-to coffee brewing companion for weeks now. As someone who values simplicity and a well-balanced cup of coffee, this manual brewer caught my attention with its sleek design and focus on retaining the natural oils and flavors of coffee. I was particularly drawn to the idea of leaving behind wasteful paper filters thanks to the reusable stainless steel mesh filter. It’s a seemingly small detail, but for coffee enthusiasts like me, this elevates the brewing experience. Over time, I’ve put this coffee maker through its paces to understand both its high points and limitations.

**Impressive Craftsmanship and Design**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this coffee maker was just how elegant it is. The heat-resistant borosilicate glass carafe feels like a piece of art, and the cork band adds both style and functionality by providing a comfortable and safe grip. The glass is sturdy yet lightweight, which makes it easy to handle while pouring. Its minimalistic design complements my kitchen aesthetic flawlessly, but function ultimately beats form here—the pour-over method is incredibly intuitive.  

The stainless steel filter is permanently included, meaning there’s no need to buy disposable filters over and over again. That’s a relief, considering how frustrating it can get when you run out of paper filters at a bad moment. The cork wrap isn't just for looks; it legitimately makes handling the carafe less nerve-racking, thanks to how heat-resistant and ergonomic it is. Whether you’re aiming for a coffee setup that looks Pinterest-worthy or something practical for everyday use, this product fits the bill.  

Check [Bodum 11571-109US price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b07kqvw6rr/)

**Brewing Performance That Stays Consistent**  
Performance is where this coffee maker truly shines. The manual brewing process may require a couple more minutes than standard machines, but the results are well worth the wait. I’ve used it daily to brew medium-ground coffee, following the suggested method of wetting the grounds first with a small amount of water before proceeding with the rest. The coffee extracts evenly, and the aroma that fills the room immediately takes you to coffee heaven.  

Each batch I brewed consistently brought out the unique flavors of different coffee blends. The permanent mesh filter did an excellent job retaining the aromatic oils, which a paper filter would have otherwise absorbed. It also caught all the grounds without leaving an unpleasant sludge at the bottom of the carafe, which is a common issue with inferior reusable filters. The brewer's capacity—eight cups of coffee at four ounces each—is perfect for someone like me who occasionally brews for guests but more often makes enough for personal indulgence across a lazy morning.  

**Strengths**  
- Reusable mesh filter avoids environmental waste while retaining coffee’s aromatic oils.  
- Heat-resistant borosilicate glass is durable and maintains coffee temperature well.  
- Cork grip is both stylish and comfortable for safe handling.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Its manual operation may not suit mornings when you're in a rush.  
- Cleanup, though simple, requires careful handling due to the carafe’s glass composition.  

**Ease of Use for Daily Routines**  
Let me be honest—this is not a product aimed at those who want a quick caffeine fix with minimal effort. Since it’s a pour-over coffee maker, there’s a bit of a ritualistic feel to its use. Pre-measure your coffee grounds, boil water, and pour slowly in a spiral motion. It’s a meditative process rather than an instant one. For me, this is part of the appeal, but I can see how some may find it too time-consuming, especially if mornings are hectic.  

Dishwashing is straightforward since both the filter and glass carafe are dishwasher-safe, but I usually hand-wash the carafe given how delicate borosilicate glass feels. The cork cannot go in the dishwasher, so cleaning that piece involves a bit of light scrubbing. These additional steps might be a chore for some, but for me, they’ve become almost a part of the daily experience I enjoy.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison, the Chemex stands as a notable rival. Chemex offers a similar design and is known for its elegant appeal, but its reliance on paper filters can detract from the purity of flavors (not to mention the recurring cost!). On the other hand, automatic drip machines like the popular Breville Precision Brewer are definitely more convenient but fail to capture the handcrafted nature of a pour-over. Where this Bodum product excels is its balance of minimalist design, flavor emphasis, and eco-friendliness. I find that it serves as an affordable, stylish middle ground for coffee lovers who aren’t quite ready to invest in something overly complicated.  

**Affordable Quality**  
I found the value of this coffee maker to be spot-on considering its quality materials and practical usability. Compared to pricier glass carafe brewers that don’t even include a reusable filter, this model provides significant cost efficiency over time. The fact that it delivers a rich and nuanced coffee experience while saving on disposable filters makes it feel even more worth the initial investment. I appreciate products that save money in the long run, not just upfront, and that’s exactly what this coffee maker achieves.

1mlpgoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1mlpgoe/comparing_nhs_endoscopy_vs_private/,Comparing NHS endoscopy vs. Private,"Won’t go too deep into my symptoms as that’s not really what this post is about but just know I am trying to conquer my oesophagitis. Had an endoscopy on the NHS a couple of years back and had a private one a couple of days ago, thought it’d be interesting to compare… 

So on the NHS I was given sedation, I was aware of what was happening, had the sensation of the camera passing down my throat and my body convulsing. But the sedation kind of made my thoughts drift, I’d get really invested in a mark on the wall or a computer screen or something so it made the whole thing way less of an ordeal. Afterwards I had the WORST heartburn of my life but it past pretty quickly thankfully. I didn’t really learn an awful lot about my condition from the NHS, was just put on a boat load of PPIs and send on my way - didn’t work by the way. 

Cut to years later I met with a private GI consultant who’s convinced I don’t suffer from acid reflux and and actually have eosinophilic oesophagitis, he tells me to come off all my PPIs gradually, wait 6 weeks and I’ll go in for an endoscopy so he can take biopsies and hopefully prove his theory. By the way ditching the PPIs had zero negative impact, they were doing nothing for me it turns out. 

Anyway, this private place is very posh, the building is very smart, central London, the clients are all clearly quite wealthy, good looking and well dressed. I’m ushered into my own private room by a very friendly nurse who gets me prepped, I even have my own private toilet. She inserts the cannula, all good all very smooth. I did notice a few flecks on blood on the floor of my room though which I mentioned, not particularly nice to see when you’re a little nervous! Anyway, they wheel me off, I say hello to the GI consultant in the procedure room, they put me on my side, put the meds into my cannula and boom, I’m back in my private room. Absolutely no recollection of the procedure whatsoever, nothing. I feel rough though, like a really bad hangover but one that passes very quickly. Throat is slightly hoarse but nothing crazy, I look down to the floor and disappointingly the blood is still there - not really what you’d expect from private. They bring me a cup of tea and some biscuits, eventually when I feel better I get dressed. My mum comes and collects me, I still feel really rough so we go sit in a park on the grass and have a coffee and half an hour later I’m completely normal again. Now waiting for biopsy results, tbc…

I suppose the reason i'm here is that i've just realised how long it's been since i've had an interesting conversation with a person outside of my friend circle. I'm looking for someone a little laid-back, possibly even international, to have regular chinwags with. 

I don't want to dissuade anyone from reaching out here purely based in their hobbies or interests, so I'll resist the urge to do the standard rhyming off of all the things i like/dislike, i find that very cold. A few minor differences & some ambiguity never hurt, and It lends itself to more interesting conversation early on, organically unpacking these things. Not knowing is half the fun. 

For those still reading this tedious stream of consciousness, i can tell you that i'm 5,7....with Vans on. I've got brown hair, blue eyes, i'm a Taurus, INFJ-A, in pretty good shape, and i speak with a north of Ireland accent. So just smile and nod in agreement when i say something that's totally indecipherable lol 

Anyway, i'm going to stop waffling now.
Hope this message finds you well. Maybe open by telling me if you take milk or sugar in your coffee or tea, just so i know you're not a pesky bot. No harm done if you don't enjoy a cuppa, i'll not hold it against you...much :)

Real Connections or Red Flags?,"So I recently stumbled into a very random corner of the internet and ended up signing up on one of those inmate dating sites. I wasn’t exactly looking for love, but curiosity got the better of me. The idea that someone behind bars might want to connect with people on the outside felt kinda wild but also human in a weird way.

I ended up messaging this guy who was doing time for a non-violent drug offense. His profile was surprisingly thoughtful. He wrote poetry, talked about books he’d read inside, and even mentioned how he missed the smell of fresh coffee. We exchanged a few letters (yeah, real mail), and he was polite, funny, and honestly more grounded than some of the dudes I’ve met on Tinder. No weird pressure or love bombing, just actual conversations.

That said, I started to feel weird about it after a few weeks. I was worried I might be getting too emotionally involved with someone whose real life I didn’t fully understand. Plus, I had no idea how common scams are on those sites, or if people pretend to be someone else. I didn’t send money or anything, but I still got a bit anxious. Has anyone else gone down this rabbit hole? Do these sites ever lead to real relationships or is it mostly just bad news waiting to happen?

1mlpf56,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedTech/comments/1mlpf56/evaluate_the_best_overear_headphones_hifiman/,Evaluate the best over-ear headphones HIFIMAN Sundara worth it?,"The HIFIMAN SUNDARA is, in a word, impressive. I've been using these on a near-daily basis, and they’ve genuinely reignited my love for music listening. The name Sundara translates to ""beautiful,"" and this planar magnetic headphone model doesn’t just live up to its name visually; the audio is every bit as captivating. I decided to take the plunge after noticing its stellar reviews and specifications, but I wasn’t entirely sure if it was worth joining the audiophile crowd. Turns out, I wasn’t disappointed—but like with most things, it’s not completely perfect.

**Sleek, Minimalist Design That Means Business**  
The first thing I noticed when unpacking was the design. With a matte black finish that screams elegance and durability, the HIFIMAN SUNDARA has a subtle yet premium look that isn’t trying too hard to impress. The all-metal headband gives it a reassuring robustness, and it feels sturdy without being overly clunky. The weight-distributing strap adds a clever touch for comfort, which was honestly a relief because I’ve had headphones in the past that pressured my head like a vise. These are headphones you can wear for hours without feeling like your head is being squeezed into submission.

**Sound Quality That Hits All The Right Notes**  
Let’s talk about the audio performance—because, frankly, that’s why you're here. The frequency response is a jaw-dropping 6Hz-75kHz. Compared to many headphones I’ve tried before, the clarity and detail are unmatched. The redesigned diaphragm, which is astonishingly thinner than the HE400 series, allows for a more precise and vibrant sound experience. Whether it was soulful jazz or a bass-heavy EDM track, every note came alive in a way I hadn’t experienced before. 

[Check HIFIMAN SUNDARA price on Amazon.](https://soundcontroltech.com/p/b077xdwt7x/)

**Perfect for Audiophiles... but Casual Listeners? Maybe Not**  
If you’re someone who takes sound seriously, the HIFIMAN SUNDARA was made for you. The planar magnetic drivers offer superb performance, placing you smack dab in the center of your music as if you're hearing it live. While testing, I could easily pick out individual instruments and unique tonal complexities, which is rare even in high-end models. However, if you’re looking for headphones to just blast Spotify while zoning out for a jog, these might be overkill.

**Highlights**  
- Ultra-thin planar magnetic diaphragm for enhanced detail.  
- Crisp vocal reproduction and dynamic bass.  
- Matte black finish with a comfortable head strap for long listening sessions.  

**Build Solid Enough for Daily Use**  
I’ve had some doubts about the longevity of headphones in the past, especially those with premium features, but the Sundara surprised me. The all-metal skeleton makes this one practically indestructible (okay, don’t go Hulk-smashing it). The 3.5mm headphone connector is durable, and I appreciate the detachable cable for replacing just one part if needed. I don’t baby these headphones, and yet they’ve held up wonderfully.

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite everything I loved about it, the HIFIMAN SUNDARA wasn’t flawless.  
- No noise cancellation. You’re getting stellar sound, but if you’re in a bustling coffee shop, you will hear the chatter.  
- Slight lack of portability. These aren’t small or foldable, so carrying them around can be cumbersome.  
- Power-demanding. Without a decent amp, you might not get the best experience.  

**Product Competitors**  
The Sundara might be a top-tier option, but it definitely faces stiff competition. I’ve compared these against the Sennheiser HD 660S and the Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pro. The HD 660S has a warmer, almost intimate sound profile that some claim is better for vocals. The DT 1990 stands out for its incredible detail retrieval, specifically in quieter classical tracks. While the Sundara reigns supreme in overall versatility, the other two headphones offer their quirks that might suit specific preferences. However, with its striking design and those planar magnetic drivers, the Sundara still feels like the most complete package to me.

**Cost Efficiency**  
In the realm of audiophile headphones, you’re always battling the price-to-performance ratio. I’d argue that the HIFIMAN SUNDARA offers excellent cost-efficiency given its impressive specs. Sure, it’s not exactly budget-friendly, but the sheer quality of sound and build justifies the investment for a dedicated music lover. You’re paying for advanced technology and a premium listening experience, so for me, this was worth every penny. If you’re on the fence, the longevity and audio quality might sway you in its favor.

1mlpeoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mlpeoz/an_hfy_tale_drop_pod_green_ch_20_part_2/,"An HFY Tale: Drop Pod Green, Ch 20 Part 2","Miss La turned to the white furred Kafya, tilting her draconic head. “They do, for a time. After long, climatic battles they feel more at ease, sometimes remaining normal for years on end as a matter of fact. What matters is that they can get all that *energy* out of them, to be let loose and able to kill for as long as possible to satiate the monster inside of them. As dark as it sounds, the Humans treat them the same way they do Earthen dogs; They let them run for as long as possible so they get tired out, and are able to be as peaceful as they can be for a while.”

“How long do they need to… be active, for?” Lirya asked, worry etching into her eyes.

Tyllia grimaced. “Active is the right word… *killing* sounds so…”

“I know.” Miss La said politely, nodding towards Tyllia. “There is no easy way to put what they do, the whole thing is a mess and scares the combined Inner Dolcir Coalition to their very bones.” She sighed, leaning back on her hands just to mog the two smaller Kafya in front of her, her sweater protesting with a stretch of fabric. “If an R.I.S. Company can land and initiate a combat for up to five hours, that buys their members a few months of peace. A full day of combat, that buys them a year. If the Company can run hot, butchering for a few days at length, that buys them a couple of years, all times having the ability to be spaced out with tranqing.”

While Tyllia stared blandly at Miss La’s face, Lirya was instead staring at Miss La’s stomach and legs, having never realized how much muscle their teacher actually had.

“Uh…” Lirya murmured, then blinked, looking up at Miss La’s face. “What do they do, during their time of lucidity?”

Miss La shrugged. “Read and watch movies, mostly. As they start to grow hungry they have to be heavily tranquilized, but at some point the blood lust starts to make them grow mad, only subsiding when they know they are about to go into combat. Over time their dosage increases until they are left completely unconscious, in which they dream.”

“Oh.” Lirya and Tyllia said at the same time, tails wagging with interest.

“I interviewed Madeye Milly at length during her short time of lucidity, and she does a lot of knitting… mostly baby clothes, which is heart breaking, but I did respect her request to take them down to Earth for newborns.” Miss La murmured, remembering the massive box she carried with her, full of booties, hats, and gloves. “She would knit while binge watching series and movies, eyes wide and ingesting them like food. She told me that when they have to put her under, *all* the way under, she replays them in her head, dreaming of a life she could have had.”

Tyllia frowned. “She watches romances, doesn’t she?”

“As many as she can get in before the madness takes her.” Miss La replied dourly. “In her mind, she is with her dead husband-to-be living the life she wanted. When she wakes, the illusion is shattered and her body turns the sorrow into rage. The Humans, after she made a name for herself and survived more battles than I have the taste to name, gave her a pair of maces, the heads shaped into hearts.”

“Do they always get such weapons?” Lirya asked, intrigued.

Miss La shook her head. “No, fresh R.I.S. members are given simple bladed weapons, hafts of steel given an edge. The more veteran and robust members are slowly given their own weapons, or more unique weapons like Cate’s claws. The Three Brothers, for instance, wield Lilgaran butcher talons, a specialized melee weapon designed to tear through flesh and armor alike. They are heavy, very heavy, but the immense strength of the Humans allows them to be wielded with deadly ease.”

Tyllia went to ask another question, but Miss La held up a massive clawed hand, her blue scales catching the light. “If you want to know more, just go buy a few packs of the cards from the shops, they can tell you more than I can about what those Humans use. I’ve been talking for nearly two hours, and there is a hot cup of coffee calling me from my room. Now shoo.”



—



Tyllia and Lirya found themselves in the same elevator, heading up towards the mercantile quarter of the station. Tyllia was standing on the far left of the elevator, while Lirya was standing to the right, hands clasped in front of her as she tried not to make eye contact with Tyllia.

Not that Lirya would, as the white furred Kafya had been taught to never look a yellow fur in the eyes, no matter how nice they may act.

The silence could not last forever though, as it was a very long elevator ride that ran priority.

“... Surprised you got onto the station."" Tyllia muttered, more to break the silence than to acknowledge the white fur.

Lirya nearly jumped at the words, then started fidgeting with her pawed fingers again. “Yes… well, *shisi* and *caracara* were able to get me off world, they were quite excited to have me be in Human space.”

“*Shisi* and *caracara*.” Tyllia mused, lifting a brow. “You must be from one of the outer worlds, explains why you’re even still alive.”

Lirya’s eyes threatened to burn with tears, but she managed to wrangle her emotions; Of all the Kafya she had to deal with on her home planet, a smaller colony world, the yellows had always been the most cruel… the most blunt.

“Yes… well.” Lirya said quietly. “I am here now, so.”

Tyllia smirked. “Your parents figured you were safer here, then, likely spent their entire savings to get you all the way to this station. I’d even wager the Humans gave you a scholar-card with a preloaded funding-slate so you could afford food.”

Lirya was struggling a bit now, her vision going a little blurry; It was true, afterall. 

Lirya had arrived with a bag of third-hand suits, patched by her mother and barely afforded by her father, just so that she could possibly fit in with the other Kafya. The Humans already knew of her financial status and had preapproved her for a funding-slate, giving her a generous amount of “dollars” on her thick piece of oval ova-plastic.

Lirya was still terrified of using it to buy anything other than food, and was now sitting on a rather substantial chunk of change. She had been urged by her Human support staff to buy whatever she liked, but she still felt an immense sense of fear, even when she finally broke and bought a single pack of socks.

The station was chilly, and she couldn’t stand the feel of her numb toes for any longer than she had willed herself to suffer.

“How much do they give you anyway?” Tyllia asked, pulling out her data-slate and tapping along it to open her messages. “A couple hundred Earth-credits so you can buy stuff from the food court?”

Lirya glanced at the yellow furred Kafya, then back down at her feet, trying her best not to sniff before she spoke. “Four thousand a month…”

“Four…” Tyllia turned to look at the white Kafya full on for the first time, finger poised above her data-slate. “Four thousand a month?!”

Tyllia winced, fidgeting faster with her pawed finger tips. “W-Well, they knew how p-poor *shisi* and *caracara* were, s-so they-”

“What are you wearing these old suits for?!” Tyllia nearly shouted, gesturing to the old and patched Kafya full body outfit that were the norm on their home worlds. “You can afford Human clothes, like me!”

Lirya’s ears drooped. “*Caracara* made them for me…”

“Ugh.” Tyllia groaned, running a hand down her face with a roll of her eyes. “You empty-headed white fur, don’t you think your mother would like to see her little *midnakankra* walking about in expensive Human clothing? You could buy some, send them off home, and your parents could sell them to make extra money.”

Lirya’s ears, once drooping, perked up as her eyes went wide. “Huh?!”

“Oh please, do you have any idea what the yellow, blacks, and blues would pay for a couple of sweatshirts?” Tyllia scoffed with a flip of her hand. “You think the Humans are able to sell this stuff on our planets? Hell no, they have to be sent back by other Kafya.”

Lirya’s mind buzzed; Her parents would be able to afford better food gels and nutrition bars, as well as get out of the old hab-unit they were currently living in. A green and brown having a child was odd enough, but the child coming out white had caused them to lose nearly all the good job opportunities in their community.

They had been able to afford a first-landing hab unit, a leaky little thing that was barely staying together only thanks to her father.

“I can…” Lirya looked to the yellow fur beside her, tail twitching with nerves. “I can buy clothes and send them back home?”

Tyllia shrugged. “I mean, yeah. You being here means you’re under Human watch anyway, so no one is going to bother your parents when the package arrives. Since you bought them and sent them home, they can sell them as they please.” She sniffed, tapping along her data-slate again. “Just don’t send too much at once or the local door-knockers will get suspicious and claim they’re running a smuggling ring. A few sweaters and a pair of pants every month won’t pull too much attention.”

Lirya, having no idea that was even a thing, turned to Tyllia, her white tail giving a slight wag. “... Thank you.”

“Don’t.” Tyllia said, raising a yellow finger in warning. “Do not thank me *nedwo*, the last thing I need is someone thinking I’m rubbing tails with you or something.”

Lirya nodded, turning away quickly and staring back at the elevator door. “Of course! Of course, my apologies.”

Despite the warning, Lirya smiled to herself, her tail giving another wag, something that made Tyllia suck her teeth in annoyance.

When the elevator door opened, Tyllia beat a hasty retreat from the presence of Lirya and sped off to get a coffee, leaving the white furred Kafya on her own.

Lirya was not big on fashion, but knew that she probably looked the part of the “broken outcast” in these suits, no matter how much she loved them due to her mother’s patches and repairs.

She wouldn’t throw them away, obviously, but likely keep them as a memento of home.

Making her way along the many stores, Lirya was not sure where to go first, turning left and right as she coursed her eyes along the many different styles of clothing. Multiple Humans had stopped to ask her if she needed help, and despite desperately wanting it, she had politely declined; White furs always had to decline, to grovel and shy away, something that had been instilled into her by the Kafya-at-large since she was but a small kitling.

“You don’t have to do that here, you know.”

Lirya spun around towards the voice, and took a step back; Sitting on a bench, arms spread out along the back rest, was the oddest looking brown furred Kafya she had ever seen.

Eyes the shade of a warm latte and fur chocolate brown, the Kafya was clearly fully seated within the arms of Human fashion; Her thick lips were pierced, a single hoop on the bottom lip that gleamed in steel, and long bangs drifted across her right eye, casting her face in soft shade. Around her wrists were bracelets that bore short, studded spikes, and her clothing was that of the general “alternative” fashions that Lirya had seen in some of the windows.

Ripped black pants, tall laced Kafya combat paw-boots, and an off-shoulder top that showed off more fur than Lirya had ever seen in her life, completed the Kafya’s look. She was a prime example of the “Human infected” Kafya that Lirya had heard warnings of, the rogue *Kuwai* that turned their backs to the Kafyan ways of life.

“W-what?” Lirya asked, quickly placing her hands in front of her as per usual, submissive both in tone and posture.

The brown fur clicked her tongue, an odd sound due to the bottom lip piercing. “Jeeze, knock it off will you?” She stood, smacking her large brown tail to dust it. “You look like I’m about to cuff you on the back of the neck for talking to me.”

Lirya smiled with a strain at the corner of her eyes, as that had happened quite a few times in her teenage years, as well as getting kicked square in the chest and launched out of a shop on the main street of her town.

“Go on, relax.” She said, shaking her hands with a jangle of her studded bracelets. “Loosen up there, ghost fur.”

Lirya’s ears drooped slightly, but she unclasped her hands, giving them a little shake with an uneasy smile.

“... That’ll have to do for now.” The brown Kafya said with a quirked brow, then offered her hand towards Lirya. “I’m Mohki.”

“Lirya.” Lirya replied, taking the woman’s hand uneasily.

The quirked brow was joined by its sister as Mohki looked surprised. “Lirya? Isn’t that the name of an ancient mood goddess or something?”

“You know of the old ways?” Lirya asked quietly, instinctively looking over her shoulders and stepping closer. “How?!”

Mohki shrugged. “Information is a little looser the farther away you get from the heart planets. We had an oooold, old elder that knew a few teachings that had been passed down orally. Lirya, the white moon of the first planet, the great white Kafya that danced with her brother, a black fur speckled with starlight.”

“I’ve never met another Kafya that knew that!” Lirya nearly giggled out, taking Mohki’s hands in hers. “I thought only my parents knew!”

“Easy there, moon fur.” Mohki said, though she was grinning at the clearly excited white Kafya in front of her. “Now, I have to imagine that you are looking to buy some clothes, right? If you’re like me, you’re going to be sending some home, too. I’d be willing to wager your poor parents are put up in the bricks.”

Lirya tilted her head. “Bricks?”

“Poorer area.”

“Oh… yeah.” Lirya replied, frowning. “Old hab unit from the first colony.”

Mohki visibly grimaced at that tidbit. “Fuck’s sakes.”

“Who?”

“Nothing. Here, let’s get you set up with some basic fare, I think.”

Lirya followed behind Mohki, more out of habit than anything else, and was led into a store that sold more basic, well rounded Human apparel. Being white furred, Lirya was able to fit into any color with ease, though Mohki appeared to treat brighter colors with the same disdain as someone would when finding shit on the bottom of their shoes. The only color that appeared to pass her muster was dark red, which she tended to linger on before handing the clothing off to Lirya.

Under the careful eye of Mohki, Lirya gained over two weeks of outfits, as well as some small items that she could mail to her parents in order to generate a little more income on her home planet. 

After a quick stop at the auto-tailor, Lirya’s new cargo pants were tail-ready, and she was shoved into a changing room by Mohki.

It was awkward at first, requiring Mohki to pop her head under the changing room door and issue pointers on how to get the Kafya-adjusted bra on, but Lirya found her way in the end.

A small issue arose when she pulled on a fresh long sleeved top, woven from cotton and linen with small ties down the arms. As Lirya pulled it on, she found it ended right below her rib cage, leaving her fur covered stomach open to the air.

“... Mohki.” Lirya said flatly, giving the hem a few small tugs to see if it had some auto-level function. “Where is the rest of it?”

“Rest of what?” Mohki asked, popping her head back under the door with data-slate in hand.

Lirya gestured to the uncovered portion of her white stomach. “The rest of the top?”

“That’s it.”

“That’s it!?”

“Yeah, that’s it, what’s the problem?”

“I’m naked! That’s the problem!”

Mohki snorted. “It’s just your stomach Lirya, worried some Human is gonna see your belly button or something?”

“But I’m not fully covered!” Lirya quietly shouted in a panic, running her fingers along her stomach fur. “What if someone sees?!”

Mohki leveled her eyes at the silently hyperventilating white Kafya, eyebrows neutral. “Lirya, we’re not on a Kafya world, you don’t have to hide every inch of your fur.”

“But what if someone sees?!” Lirya repeated, going to take off the top. “What if I’m reported!”

“Ah ah!” Mohki shouted, reaching up and slapping at Lirya’s hands. “Stop that! You’re on a Human station, no one can do a damn thing to you and your parents have immunity! For fuck’s sakes you’re carrying around a data-slate issued by the UAA government, relax!”

“But…” Lirya said, cowering under the correcting hands of Mohki.

“But nothing.” Mohki said, now reaching up with both hands to correct Lirya’s top while her data-slate balanced on her stomach. “Treat this as your first lesson in liking yourself. You’re a *nedwo* on a Human station, no one is going to drag you off into a dark corner and take you out just because you have moon fur.”

Lirya’s heart was hammering in her ribcage as she looked down at herself, shoulders and stomach showing more fur than she ever had in public. “But…”

“No buts.” Mohki said sternly, tugging Lirya’s cargo pants down another inch to show off her hip bones. “Now put on those station socks and come on out, time to be who you were always supposed to.”

Despite the statement, it still took a lot of coaxing from Mohki and a lot of offered praise from the store staff to finally get Lirya to leave the dressing room. Once out in the open air, and still trying to tug down on the hem of the crop top, Lirya nearly crumbled to pieces over the explosion of chatter from the Human store staff.

Being called “cute” and “adorable” was not something Lirya was used to, and she could feel the sweat pouring down her back and tail.

With her extra clothing on the way to her room via a helpful A.I. delivery vehicle, and the parcels to her parents sent down to the shipping terminal, Lirya slowly became accustomed to her clothing. Walking beside the brash and open Mohki slowly built her confidence, the brown Kafya making sure to glare or bare her teeth at any Kafya who threw a sidewise glance at Lirya.

The warnings from her weren’t ignored; Mohki came from a warrior clan of high repute on the fringe planets within Kafya control, a clan that was further marking themselves with the curious piercings that Humans had introduced to the arm of the galaxy.

“Are you sure this is fine?” Lirya asked, looking down at her sleeved arms and open stomach. “Humans wear this stuff?”

Mohki smiled. “Of course. Probably *warmer* stuff up on the station, but you need to get out of that Kafya shell you’ve been wrapped up in. I know how moon furs were treated, and this is the best place you could ever be.”

“... Alight.” Lirya murmured, though she was enjoying all the smiles she got from the Humans, Pwah, and Kojynn.

“So what did you want to do next? I saw the balance on that card of yours, you didn’t even make a dent in it.” Mohki said, reaching up and stretching her arm muscles and back.

Lirya watched her; She was very lithe, much like a yellow fur, but it was always fascinating seeing how much muscle the war-like colors had. “Well, I was hoping to buy some trading cards.”

“Trading cards?” Mohki asked, cocking a brow. “What do you need trading cards for?”

“Miss La mentioned that Humans have them for members of the R.I.S., and they piqued my interest I suppose.” Lirya replied, going back to fidgeting with her pawed fingers. “What do you do on the station, if I may ask?”

Mohki pointed above her. “I work at the docks.”

“The docks?” Lirya asked, surprised. “Not station security?”

“What? A warrior clan Kafya can’t relax and just lift heavy stuff?” Mohki said with a wink, then clicked her teeth. “I don’t like the Kojynn though, they like to show off and haul around more stuff than me.”

After a bit of negotiating with the map of stores, the two Kafya found the single store that carried the trading cards, a little place that was made up of mostly gaming tables and a long wall of merchandise.

According to the store owner, most of the stuff people wanted came from Earth directly via mail shuttles, as there was little sense to have a huge stock of gaming stuff on an orbiting space station.

Lirya was happily talking to the heavy-set Human at the counter when she froze, her eyes locked at a glance towards the door. Both the man and Mohki were confused until they looked, spying Tyllia standing in the doorway with her arms crossed.

Tyllia looked Lirya from toe to ear tip, her face judging with raised brows. “Wow, from body suits to crop tops in only a few hours, you *nedwos* work qui-”

Her words were cut off as a pack of playing cards thwacked off her forehead, causing the yellow furred Kafya to stumble backwards.

“What the shit?!” Tyllia howled, rounding around to say something else before spying the larger brown Kafya.

Mohki, without missing a beat, picked up another pack of cards and brandished it. “You want another one, *daquihass*?”

Being called a “pissfur” by a brown was a heavy slight to a yellow, but Tyllia knew full well that Mohki could make her suck on her own foot. Plus, she had that lip piercing and was wearing all black, which put her in the fringe Blackmoon warrior clan.

That didn’t stop her fur from standing on end in rage, Mohki following suit as Lirya shrunk backwards behind the brown Kafya.

“I would like to *avoid* calling the station’s current lead female to take care of this.” The Human said, sighing out while running a hand along his growing bald spot. “She doesn’t like how many calls this store generates in the first place, during game nights. I warned her about slaughter tournaments but she still sends me hate emails…”

Lirya, despite her trembling tail and fingers, leaned around the shoulder of the lowly growling Mohki. “Um… Tyllia. Could we just open cards?”

Tyllia’s eyes snapped to Lirya’s, which were glancing back and forth between her and Mohki, and it took everything she had not to growl back. Getting upstaged by some military dirt stomper was going to make her look bad… but she really wanted to look at the cards, too.

“Fine.” Tyllia spat, crossing her arms. “But I’m not sitting next to your *bodyguard*.”

Lirya placed a hand on Mohki’s shoulder, which oddly enough seemed to instantly ease the brown Kafya’s ire. “Mohki?”

“... Yeah, sure.” Mohki muttered, flexing her strong fingers. “But if the *butter dog* gets uppity, she’s going to get a fresh one.”",5,1754745985.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

Miss La had been fearing the question ever since the ship had passed by the station, internally sweating when she had been having lunch in the massive restaurant level.

Bearing a massive white skull atop a black painted hull, the flat, heavily armed ships were extremely hard to miss. The students had all seen it pass by the station on its way to the current planet that the Humans were fighting on, but Miss La feared what was on board that vessel more than the student’s questions.

If anything, she was unsure how the students would react knowing such beings were held on the surface of Earth, lurking in the “kennels” under the watchful eye of their “vets”.

The *real* reason why the Humans had managed to fend off the Pactless.

Miss La left her room with dragging, sluggish steps, having been unable to fully sleep the entire night as she struggled to formulate her thoughts on what those students were going to ask her when they arrived.

The little delivery bot, to her surprise, had been waiting at the door as soon as it opened, bearing two vanilla lattes.

“What’s this?” Miss La had asked, leaning down to grab one of the offered cups.

The little delivery bot had wagged a clawed hand at her. “Come on now; No reading, no major bandwidth draws, and you forgot to put in your order. That means you are worried about those students asking about *the ship*.”

“Even we scholars of Humanity have good reason to feel uncomfortable when we see a Midnight Alcove.” Miss La replied, walking down the hallway as the little delivery bot trundled along beside her. “A ship of iron bars and cells, armories, and monsters that not even I can mentally wrap my mind around. Have you ever been around one, A.I.?”

The little delivery robot shook its head, wheels whirring near Miss La’s shins. “Of course not, they don’t allow A.I. on those ships, nor would I want to be. Normally I like the Human temples, but the ones on those boats have an energy that not even we can contemplate in our binary.”

“The students are not going to like what they hear.” Miss La murmured, taking a slow sip of her latte before clicking her tongue and closing her four eyes in a sigh. *“No one* likes what they hear when they learn of the disease. It’s why the Pwah and Kafya are suspicious of Humanity as a whole.”

By some way, the delivery bot managed to shrug with its delivery arms. “Sounds like a ‘you’ problem there, teach’.”

“Thank you for reminding me.” Miss La grumbled.

With a cheery wave, the delivery bot handed Miss La her other Latte and turned the corner, speeding off towards the restaurant level. “Good luck with the students!”

Miss La grimaced, mocking the little robot in a sing-songy, false happy voice. “Good luck with the students, meh meh meh…”

It didn’t taken long for Miss La to reach her classroom, and found with a glare of annoyance that all the students had arrived well before her, ready and waiting to pepper her with questions.

Miss La still found herself standing outside the classroom, building up the energy to dive into this particular dark corner of the Humans and the afflictions their war of survival had impregnated them with.

She knew she had to get in there eventually, so she strode into the classroom with as much calm air as she could, trying to not betray her unease. Towering above many of them, Miss La tossed one empty latte into the trash slot, set the other one down on her desk, but did not bother sitting down.

Miss La straightened her sweater, popped the hem, then crossed her arms under her chest, causing the fibers of the sweater to stress outwards with a quiet groan of the fibers.

“Alright.” Miss La said aloud, grimacing. “Who’s first?”

Every hand within the classroom raised into the air, which the Kojynn applied in duplicate. Miss La however instead turned to Lirya, the only white furred Kafya in the room that was still sitting on the opposite side of the room to her race.

More like they were sitting on the opposite side of the room from her… Miss La had read up on whatever the hell was going on with that, and had found it rather depressing. 

White furred Kafya were seen as “cursed”, as they were devoid of color and as such were “un-Kafya like”. This was doubly so due to Lirya’s black eyes, forming the ying and yang of having all colors in her eyes, but lacking any color to her fur.

What had really bothered Miss La was that while researching the whole thing, she had hit a literal roadblock; Any and all information on the white furried Kafya stopped as if it had been memory holed or erased, and no amount of deep data-stream searching could pull anything to her attentions. There was a rumor that Kafya leadership was murdering certain white furs that “shined too brightly”, but again it was like pulling anvil scales.

She tried to rope in a few bored A.I. to help her, but even they were surprised when they hit an absolute data desert, scrubbed clean of any mentions of white furred Kafya. They were still searching, as far as she knew, and she waited with curiosity to see what they could dredge up from the data-streams.

“Yes, Lirya?” Miss La asked, pointing a muscled hand at the white furred Kafya.

Her eyes sparkled like obsidian jewels, clearly happy that her teacher had remembered her name… something she did not hear much nowadays.

“The black ship.” Lirya asked, pointing out towards the door. “With the white Human skull, what was that?”

All the eyes in the room turned from Lirya to Miss La, whose jaw tightened to such a degree that her facial scales flexed. The Skalathir’s muscular blue tail twitched disquietly, her muscles flexing against her sweater as she stressed. 

“Whatever I say, now,” Miss La began, her voice measured but tense, “Should not, and should never, change your opinion about Humans or the planet down below us. All races of the stars have their shadows and monsters that hide inside them, and Humanity is no different.""

Miss La bared her teeth for a scant moment, then slowly began to pace along her little teaching platform. “However, if it was a competition… Humans have the scariest monsters this side of the *Mentha Kloren*.”

“Milky Way, according to the Humans.” A male Pwah with deep purple hair murmured, eliciting a few chuckles from those nearby.

“Indeed.” Miss La said, but her voice held no humor, causing the chuckles to dry up as if a re-entry engine had kicked on above a puddle.

Miss La mildly enjoyed their sudden looks of unease, it would get them in the right mindset for what she was about to say.

“As you know, the Humans spiked in their civilization’s power level after their near-destruction by the Pactless.” She began, still pacing slowly as she spoke. “Due to the munitions used by the Pactless, Humanity suffered under a few genetic mutations. You would know them as ‘stung’ Humans, since we covered them and all the odd little colors they tend to come in. The Humans took the recovered technology and began to rapidly rearm and re-tech themselves to combat any other forces that could come from the stars and attack.”

Miss La drew in a long breath through her draconic nostrils, then turned to face the class fully. “But there was another genetic mutation, one that no one knew about until decades after the war with the Pactless. A mutation that was unleashed upon the Ur to devastating effect.”

“Another mutation?” A Kojynn male asked, his four hands steepled in interest. “I had believed there was only one mutation, the ones who are stung. There has been no mention of a second mutation to the Humans.”

Miss La nodded. “Because it is not spoken of in polite conversation, and due to its use in the war against the Ur, it is not really spoken of at all out of respect. It is only really brought up when a Midnight Alcove is spotted, and people start asking questions about what lies inside the black ships.”

“I saw a schematic of the ships, on the data-stream.” Tyllia said quietly, her yellow fur fluffing slightly and bright, lilac eyes wide. “It’s just… cages, row upon row of cages.”

“Cells.” Miss La corrected. “Steel barred cells for the containment of the R.I.S. units.”

The room was quiet, and slowly, very slowly, Lirya raised her white furred hand.

“... R.I.S. units?” She asked, her black eyes wide.

Miss La nodded, her voice low with warning. “R.I.S. Redemption. In. Sacrifice.”

“Redemption?” The male Kojynn asked, his mask sprawling with lines of both worry and intrigue.

“Redemption.” Miss La replied, her voice even. “While the stung Humans gained odd colorings to their hair and eyes, others instead became ticking time bombs, an untraceable fuse that is hiding in hundreds of thousands of Humans. Despite the best efforts of their medical scientists during their Resurrection Directive phase, they never realized there was a curse lurking amongst the newly reborn, laying in wait for a trigger in order to fully blossom within their minds.”

Miss La, arms still folded, stopped on her stage and stood before them fully, eyes filled with sorrow. “It is not their fault. How could they have known? How could they have understood that the slapdash and horrible weapons of the Pactless altered their very DNA? The stung were born immediately bearing their oddities, pink and blue hair where once blonde and brown should have stood, how would they have known something darker lurked beneath?”

The Qua-quid screen came to life with the press of Miss La’s index finger to her thumb pad, and the Skalathir half turned, unfolding her arms to gesture with a hand. “Here we see a normal Human, male and female.”

Upon the screen was a normal male and female Human, non-stung of average build and height. They were pouring coffee into cups that sat on a stone countertop, steam rising from the brim as they smiled at each other.

“Their ferocity is known, their ability to engage any enemy they see as a threat if they are shown as a threat to things they hold dear, such as friends and family.” Miss La said, feeling a lump slowly forming in her throat. “But they hold back, a limiter placed into their bodies *by* their very humanity, a greater self that allows them to be the monster that can scoot spiders onto paper, to go out of their way to help a turtle across a road. But that ferocity comes from a place deep down, a feral place within the mind that has been tempered and controlled by thousands of years of development, thousands of years of culture and codes that kept them in check.”

Miss La turned back to her class, her face now dire. “What do you think would happen if suddenly all the bars and chains were removed from the gate, and the doors were allowed to fully swing open?”

The room grew colder; Lilgaran hoods flared, the masks of the Kojynn stopped displaying code and light, the Drafritti looked uncomfortable for the first time during these classes, while the Kafya and Pwah shared uneasy glances.

“You get a *monster*, a real, monster.” Miss La said, her tone quiet. “You get the raw, feral form of a Human and all the horrifying things they are capable of. Strength, bloodlust, speed, the ability to fight for hours on end, smiling with bared teeth as they tear, shred, and kill until either they simply pass out from exhaustion, are killed themselves, or are darted by their handlers.”

Miss La pulled up an image of an R.I.S. trooper, the blonde haired woman smiling ferociously at the screen while thick Ur blood streamed down her face, armor halfway torn to shreds and her left arm missing at the elbow. The students drew back, though Lirya kept still, her black eyes staring at the screen; Despite the damage to her arm, the grievous wounds trickling crimson blood, the Human seemed unbothered, eyes wide in pleasure and…

“She’s afraid.” Lirya said quietly, pointing to the woman’s eyes. “I see fear… and loathing. Self loathing.”

Miss La was surprised; Both she and the other scholars had come to that conclusion after years of study and interviews, but this odd little white Kafya had picked up on the cues purely off of sight alone.

“You would be accurate.” Miss La said, causing Lirya to smile to herself and sit up proudly. “These Humans are unlocked, unbound, but highly aware of how broken they are. They do not feel pain the same as other Humans, or have their control, but they are fully conscious of how wrong everything is. They *love* pain, they love to hunt, to chase, to kill, to spread terror and slaughter until their very bones and muscles give out. After the first wave of children from the Resurrection Directive aged, murders and killings began to skyrocket in certain areas, not following any kind of pattern that usually came from a more standard murderer or killer. This caused Humans to begin hunting these killers… and instead found mothers, fathers, sons and daughters all unbound, released from the confines of their humanity and unlocked to be the animals they were always *meant* to be in the wild. The activation of the altered DNA within them happens randomly, sometimes not until the age of *seventy*, but is triggered by stress, fear, anger, rage, hunger, desire, any strong emotions that have been closely tied with Humans.”

Miss La sighed, activating the next image that showed a male Human teenager raging in a chair, tied and bound by straps as he howled… but with that same feral, intense grin. “They are not mad… or insane. They are just… broken. They can speak, use logic, even operate advanced machinery, but they are extremely unstable. When fed a constant supply of violence and bloodshed, they can manage their symptoms to the point they themselves are… controllable. Lilgaran and Kojynn medical researchers developed a kind of tranquilizer that takes the edge off of their minds for a while, allowing them to even be sociable, but do not be confused; Underneath an R.I.S. member’s muscle and flesh is a cold blooded, uncaring killer that only mourns their actions in their sleep, or when they are left to their own quiet.”

“So… on that ship…” Tyllia said, remembering just how large that ship had been.

“Are hundreds of Humans like that, some of them veterans of the Ur conflict and still able to go toe to toe with anything they are thrown at. They are the modern rendition of the *berserker*, a warrior of ancient Human history, but not by choice. They are an ailment of the Pactless war, still infecting Earth and their colonies to this day. While it would be more benevolent to kill them, these broken Humans instead prefer to serve, to gain some form of redemption through service to the Human race and their allies. This in turn allows them to follow the paths and codes of their religion, as they hope to gain salvation in the afterlife by turning their curses and sins to duty.” Miss La said, bringing up an image of multiple veterans of the Ur conflict, all of them baring their teeth in wide, malicious grins while their ‘vets’ lingered behind them. There were three males and two females, all bearing tattered remnants of combat armor. “These three men here are the Three Brothers, their entire family line activating during an outing of recreational football during Thanksgiving. The entire genetic line had the altered DNA, and after a stray dog attacked their own beloved family hound and her puppies, they all activated at once, ripping the dog to shreds and nearly killing all of their neighbours before Vets could arrive. Only the three eldest brothers remain, the rest of the family perishing during their combat against the Ur.”

Miss La then gestured to a red haired woman who looked like a predatory cat, though that may have just been due to the massive gauntlets she wore on her hands, bearing long, curved knives. “This is Cat Claw Cate, who activated after being the victim of a violent rape. When they found her, she had already ripped off both the arms and legs of her rapist, and was gouging out his eyes with her thumbs. Authorities had been alerted by the man’s screams, who died shortly thereafter from blood loss.”

“Then there is Madeye Milly.” Miss La sighed out, gesturing to the blue haired woman who bore bright, orange eyes. “She bore both genetic markers, a stung Human who turned out to be a living bomb. After being asked to marry her boyfriend of five years, she had been happy, preparing to make a new life with the man she loved. Her fiancé, however, was caught in the middle of a robbery and killed, the perpetrators being a pair of rogue Dornucha smugglers attempting to make off with Earth-made emeralds to sell on the black market.”

A female Pwah actually shook her head, looking aghast. “Dornucha smugglers? How did those finned-headed scumbags get down to Earth in the first place?!”

“Hiding within a Kojynn trading barge and deploying a slip-skiff, they had hoped to skip right off of Earth, regardless of the damage it would have done to the surrounding area. Instead, they were gunned down by Human authorities, and created a monster that killed seventeen Drafritti and Kojynn families out of grief.” Miss La said, her eyes softening as she stared at the vacant eyes of Madeye Milly. “The loss of her happiness, and it being stolen by off-wordlers, made Milly into a demon-made-real, tearing through non-Human life like a blender.”

The room was quiet as Miss La brought forward the next image, a legion of Humans chained to the ground in kneeling positions as their armor was placed upon them by mechanical armory arms. 

“They were not bad people.” Miss La said quietly, her voice easily carrying above the silence. “They were good people who had no idea what they were, who became beasts when the wrong thing happened to them at the wrong time. They now live as weapons, thrown at an enemy in the hope that they can be redeemed in their death, to pay for their sins and to die as soldiers instead of murderers.” She turned to the students, her strong draconic hands flexing. “That ship you saw, bearing a white skull on a black hull, carries the damned. Broken Humans who are only seeking to find peace in their death fighting against an enemy. All of you know where the Humans are currently fighting, a young world where the inhabitants were being stolen by flesh traders. That R.I.S. vessel carries not one, but *three* Companies of these damned souls who are biting at the chance to die fighting for such a worthy cause.”

Miss La then raised her head slightly, bearing down on her voice with authority. “You did not see soldiers passing us by, on that ship. You saw people who desire to die as *good*, rather than bad, no matter how much damage they take in the process. They are tired, frayed, and exhausted to the soul, bound in the flesh of murderers, killers, and slaughterers of the highest degree.”

The rest of the class went on for the remainder of their time, Miss La explaining the rest of the more “celebrity” of the R.I.S. members, mostly the members that survived the Ur conflict and had made a name for themselves. By the time the class ended and the students had left the room, Miss La only saw Lirya and Tyllia remaining, so she settled in for more questions.

“I assume you are wanting to know if your sister is safe or not.” Miss La asked Tyllia, sitting down on the top of her desk with a groan of its legs.

“Yes.” Tyllia said, keeping her distance from Lirya.

Miss La smiled, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “She’ll be fine. All R.I.S. members have a Vet behind them, armed to the teeth. If they get out of line, the Vet either kills them or tranqs them, keeping the more valuable members under control and usable another day. They may be seeking a redeeming death, but Humans are not wasteful of those with talent.”

“Do they get medical services?” Lirya asked, her ears perked in interest but side-eying the yellow Kafya beside her. “In battle?”

“No.” Miss La replied. “If they die, they die. Now while I understand Tyllia staying behind, since her sister is currently on the planet that ship is heading to, I’m not sure why you stayed behind, Lirya.”

Lirya played with the tips of her padded fingers, clicking her nails together as she mulled over the words in her head.

“Well…” Lirya began, looking over at Tyllia and then to Miss La. “Is there no way to… you know… fix them?”

Tyllia seemed interested in this as well, blinking at Miss La as her own ears perked.

Miss La, however, smiled sadly, crossing her thick, muscular legs with another groan of the desk. “No, Lirya. I’m afraid there is no way to fix them, and there have been no signatures found within the genetic code yet. Whatever weapon the Pactless had used, it had irreparably damaged the genetic code of some Humans, and done so invisibly. You would think some Kojynn or Pwah would be able to figure it out by now, but no headway has been made in years.”

“So they are cursed, forever?” Tyllia asked, a little disturbed by the idea. “All Humans are left to wonder if one bad day will change them into a monster?”

Miss La sighed, rubbing at the corner of her lower left eye. “I’m afraid so. It is still rare, mind you, roughly only one in eight thousand having the chance of having the affliction, but that still leaves plenty of Humans to bear the mark. More odd is that there are some Humans that go their entire lives without activating the genetic time bomb, only gaining a few moments of rage before they die of old age.” She then chuckled, blinking her eyes. “I guess that at least lets their descendants have some kind of warning, take the tranquilizer as a precaution until they die…”

“Why do they get nicknames?” Tyllia asked, grimacing. “It almost sounds like… glorification.”

Miss La actually laughed this time, wafting a hand at Tyllia. “Oh, Humans will do that automatically. Celebrities come in all shapes and sizes, and the more well-known of the R.I.S. members gain their own followings as they survive and make a name for themselves. There are entire trading card games down there designed around the R.I.S. survivors, their battles and estimated kills marked on cards, along with special abilities that can be used in the game. Quite popular, really.”

“Are they really so mad?” Lirya asked, still picking at her fingertips with her nails. “Do they not find peace, even for a short time?”",5,1754745982.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

When we hang out, he constantly talks about women like that's all he talks about. He brags about hookups with onlyfans women. If we're in public, he'll literally run up to random women to ask their number, like literally if a woman passed him he gets excited and runs 10 meters to follow her and try to talk to her.

I can see they're uncomfortable, and I feel embarrassed standing nearby. He also pressures me to do the same, even though I've told him that i'm not interested. I never chase women and i've had plenty of girlfriends, matter of fact I just broke up like 7-8 months ago and i'm trying to focus on myself. I also don't do one night stands.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Philadelphia Union vs. Toronto FC: The Unstoppable Force Meets Toronto’s “I’ve-Had-Coffee” Defense**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of MLS titans: the Philadelphia Union (1-3 in the table, but with the swagger of a team that’s forgotten how to lose) take on Toronto FC (rebuilding project, but with a defense that’s sipped from the coffee cup of discipline). Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game is basically a rom-com where you already know who ends up with the lead.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Philadelphia’s “I’m-Too-Expensive-to-Lose” Edge

The odds make this as clear as a referee’s whistling in a penalty box. Philadelphia is the undisputed favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.31–1.39** (implied probability: **72–76%** to win). Toronto? They’re the underdog equivalent of a gluten-free donut at a bakery—present, but not the main act. Their odds of **7.5–8.15** (implied **11–13%**) suggest bookmakers think they’ll need a miracle, a red card, and a sudden mastery of set pieces to pull off the shocker.

The spread? Philadelphia’s -1.5, meaning they’re expected to win by *at least two goals*. If you’ve ever tried to climb a hill in Philadelphia’s hilly terrain (yes, it’s a thing), you’ll understand why the Union are favored—they’re just… *up there*. The total goals line sits at **2.5–3.0**, so expect a game where both teams take their foot off the gas after scoring once or twice.

### Digesting the News: Toronto’s New Toy vs. Philly’s “We’ve Done This Before” Mentality

Philadelphia enters this match on a four-game unbeaten streak, which in MLS terms is like a toddler’s attention span—impressive, but not permanent. Manager Bradley Carnell isn’t taking Toronto lightly, though.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Padres vs. Red Sox: A Pitching Masterclass vs. a Home Run Happy Hour**  
The San Diego Padres (-146) and Boston Red Sox (+215) collide at PETCO Park in a clash of elite pitching vs. explosive offense. Let’s break this down with the precision of a catcher’s glove and the humor of a umpire who’s had one too many cups of coffee.

---

### Parse the Odds: Math, My Dear Watson

The Padres are favorites with a **3.60 ERA**, second-best in MLB, while the Red Sox sport a **3.73 ERA**, still respectably eighth. But here’s the kicker: the Padres win **59.7% of the time** when favored, versus Boston’s **47.6%** as underdogs. Translation? San Diego’s pitching staff is a math teacher’s wet dream—consistent, reliable, and never late to class. Boston’s offense, meanwhile, has blasted **141 home runs this season**, which is about 41 more than you’d find in a reasonable person’s backyard.

Implied probabilities from the odds tell us the Padres are expected to win \~59.3% of the time, Boston \~45.5%. The gap isn’t a chasm, but it’s wide enough to fit a truckload of Manny Machado’s RBI.

### Digest the News: Star Power and Lobster Tales

Key players? **Manny Machado** (.300 BA, 20 HR, 72 RBI) is the Padres’ offensive anchor, a man who turns singles into standing ovations. On the mound, **Michael King** starts for San Diego—steady as a metronome, with a 3.20 ERA in 150 innings this year.

For Boston, **Lucas Giolito** takes the hill, a pitcher so enigmatic he once tried to explain quantum physics to a batting practice robot… and the robot hit a triple. The Red Sox’s **Jarren Duran** (.264 BA) leads their offense, though “team-high” feels like a polite way of saying “the rest of the squad’s hitting like they’re swinging glow sticks.”

Now, the fun part: rumors. Giolito is reportedl

Cambodia should brace itself for the next round of repercussions.
Cambodia is now fully aware of Thailand's genuine anger. The initial response was an overwhelming and unforgettable assault on their military bases and strongholds, resulting in the death of one general and the disappearance of two others (who were previously prominent in the media but have not been seen since).
Furthermore, the Aranyaprathet electricity authority has permanently and decisively cut off the power supply by removing the lines, an act described by a Thai proverb as ""cutting the tail and leaving it at the temple,"" signifying a complete and final abandonment.
With the borders closed, trade has come to a standstill for both Thailand and Cambodia.
While the return of migrant workers briefly stunned Thailand, the country will soon adjust and find new sources of labor without much difficulty.
But what about Cambodia? A primary source of income—the remittances sent home by its workers—has been cut off. A million workers means a million families are waiting for money from Thailand. If each worker sent home 3,000 Baht per month, that's a loss of 3 billion Baht instantly.
Trying to find work in Vietnam is incredibly difficult due to low wages and a lack of job openings. Laos and Myanmar are in similar situations, with their own citizens also seeking work in Thailand. The Thai Baht has, in effect, become the de facto dominant currency in the region, a testament to Thailand's economic strength.
The health situation is even more dire. After seeing the poor quality of care Cambodian soldiers receive in their own hospitals, it's no wonder why Cambodian citizens desperately try to seek medical treatment in Thailand.
The cruel irony is that as incomes plummet, expenses are rising. This is because essential Thai goods, which Cambodians have come to rely on, must now be purchased through Laos, where they are marked up. As a result, the cost of living is projected to increase by at least 20%.
There is no electricity, no fuel, goods are expensive, there are no jobs, and no money for food.
When these ""five curses"" converge unexpectedly, a result of the Hun family's actions...
Cambodia will face a surge in theft and robbery. With people growing desperate and starving, crime rates will skyrocket to unprecedented levels.
Cambodians will flee their country, escaping starvation to find work in Thailand, which is undeniably the best option in the region. They will cross through any means possible, whether through natural borders or by being smuggled in like ""fish transport trucks"" of the past.
Fighting with weapons is not as agonizing as fighting with economics and the torment of hunger.
I find it laughable to see Cambodian influencers raising money for frontline villagers. When you calculate it per person, it amounts to just over 200 Baht. Even ""Sergeant Somkrok"" only received a bag of coffee and 60 Baht.
I believe Cambodian influencers shouldn't even dare to compare themselves to Thailand. They are ""pathetic,"" right down to their hairstyles.
At the refugee camps, Thai officials have had to discreetly tell some families, ""Two trips are enough. Taking so much home on a pickup truck is excessive, you are here as war refugees, not to make a profit.""
At this moment, Cambodia is only surviving by engaging in mass self-hypnosis.
After a while, the hypnosis will wear off. When real hunger sets in, the true reality of the border, the military bases, and the frontlines will gradually become clear.
The Cambodian people will begin to realize that since the fall of Phnom Penh during the Pol Pot regime 70-80 years ago, their country has made no progress whatsoever.
They remain poor, desperate, and undeveloped, with outdated weapons, surviving day-to-day on Cold War-era propaganda.
It truly lives up to its nickname: ""The Cursed Land.""

The rain sheeted in great heaves, as if the city itself were crying, Gallows Reach had many sins to lament about. Dirk Strangelove stood, motionless, as the downpour hammered his once boyish features and sluiced off the shoulders of his greatcoat. The foetid rain pooled at his once polished boots, running into the cracks of the gurgling, rust-chocked drainage systems, whispering secrets of portents to come. His face now all jagged charm and weathered confidence, held the kind of smirk that promised violence veiled behind a politely worded jab. Limp blonde hair, clung to his time beaten brow, strands matted by acid rain and the old ghosts of better days. Beneath the great coat, where his left arm ended at the elbow, and old cybernetic prosthetic, one that had seen better days and was held together by second hand wiring and hope, Dirk was woefully low on hope these days. His armour, cobbled together, patched but intact, spoke of exquisite craftmanship where it was once fabricated. It spoke of a man who didn’t care to look polished, only to survive. Tucked beneath his coat, in the crook of his pit, a worn leather holster, holding a deadly secrete Dirk was too happy to tell. An ornate flechette pistol – its grip inlaid the silver scripture (long since faded) only he knew the meaning of, it’s short snubbed barrel etched with tally marks – kills, missions or days when Dirk was bored – no one but him knew the real meaning behind them. Dirk looked forward, Regalement blend cigarette hanging from his cracked lips, the smoke curling into the night as if not even the cigarette wanted to be here. Eyes burning with a youthful glow that his face didn’t reflect.

“hmm, dead again, let’s see who’s bothered to turn up today”

Dirk Strangelove had been declared dead before. Twice, if you were the sort who kept score — the second time involving a synth-acid reservoir, three missing weeks, and his return with a tan and a liver that definitely hadn’t belonged to him in the first place. But this was the first time the Ministry had gone to the trouble of putting on a funeral.

Rain came down hard over Gallows Reach, pushing into the streets like it was trying to wash the city away and finding only more grime to stir up. The place wasn’t built to die — it was half-lived in, half-condemned, and fully strangled under its own paperwork. Every block spoke its own breed of red tape. Pigeons wore tags. Beggars carried licenses. Even the air smelled faintly of old toner and damp bureaucracy. Entire districts had drowned under paper before the water could even reach their knees.

Dirk stood under a shivering strip of neon that passed for shelter, watching people file into the chapel across the road. Squat, windowless, the colour of cheap brick — the sort you buy by the ton when you’re not planning on the building being loved. Above the doors, an electronic marquee blinked its own slow obituary:

**DIRK STRANGELOVE – REMEMBERED IN SILENCE.**

“Silent,” Dirk muttered, rolling a Regalement Blend between his fingers before sparking it to life. The tip caught with a green glow and a sound like it didn’t approve of where it was headed. He took a drag anyway, ash falling into the gutter to swirl away with the rain. The taste burned, the way a bad memory does when you poke it too hard.

Address? Correct. Time? Correct. His pulse? Still running. Not that the Ministry cared enough to make note of it.

He stepped out from the awning, boots finding the slick street with a wet slap. The drizzle had teeth, a faint chemical bite that worried at the seams of his coat and promised to eat through if he gave it time. Dirk didn’t hurry. Let the rain try.

The funeral home looked like it had been a loan office in a past life and hadn’t quite shaken the habit. You could imagine the place once trading in percentages and late fees; now it just itemised souls and added grief as a surcharge. The automatic doors made an unconvincing attempt at civility, dragging themselves open too slow for the living. Dirk shoulder-checked one, muttered an apology to the sensor, and stepped inside. It gave a wheeze like it had been expecting him all along.

The place smelled of incense long past its prime, toner that had died in the machine, and that stale bureaucratic musk you only get in buildings where nothing moves without a signature. Overhead, tinny funeral music seeped from hidden speakers, breaking every so often for a burst of static and the Ministry’s cheery reminder to re-check all Form D7 submissions. Dirk grimaced. The irony was a mouthful. He wondered if they’d had the nerve to play it during his own service.

A woman in a crisp black uniform tried to hand him a pamphlet at the door. He let it hang between them and kept walking. She didn’t push it, her gaze sliding past him the way you glance over a maintenance code in the wrong font — register it, then immediately forget it.

He took in the room.  
Pews: half full. Faces: half familiar. A couple of old Hunters. A supply clerk he’d once tumbled into bed with. Someone who might have been a synthetic grief consultant — they’d clearly read the manual on crying but hadn’t got the knack for it yet. Up front, a young couple leaned into one another, whispering in the kind of hushed confusion that didn’t know whether to be sad or suspicious. Dirk kept his hood low and slipped into the back row. The seat took his weight with a reluctant creak, like it might just give out under the load of grief no one had earned.

The casket was front and centre. Closed. Sealed with red Ministry wax, the stamp pressed deep and certified. That wasn’t standard procedure — unless they didn’t want anyone looking inside. Unless someone was keeping something under wraps.

At the podium stood Grint. Dirk knew him straight away — former requisitions officer turned funeral director, a man who looked like life had wrung him out and left him to dry on the wrong setting. His suit hung on him like a last-minute apology. He tapped a screen on the lectern, cleared his throat with the energy of someone reading their own poor performance review.

“Dirk Strangelove served with moderate distinction, demonstrated passable courage, and expired during service to the Reach.”

Dirk let out a quiet, bitter laugh. “Moderate distinction? That’s generous.”

A woman two rows up twisted in her seat, eyes narrowing, then turning away quickly. Probably convinced she’d imagined him. Dirk didn’t blame her — most people didn’t like seeing ghosts before the coffee came out.

The service ground on. A data-eulogist flickered into being beside the casket, all smooth, synthetic sympathy. The voice read from its loop of sanctioned lines:

“We celebrate the dedication of a man who never let protocol obstruct his purpose…”  
“He will be remembered, as all Hunters are, in operational logs and mandatory grief metrics.”  
“Please consult your grief counsellor before adjusting your morale score.”

A drone drifted overhead, its lens iris clicking open with a neat little chirp as it swept the rows. Dirk tilted his head and held his breath. It hovered a moment, beeped once, then floated on.

Either it didn’t recognise him, or it had been told not to.

Leaning forward, Dirk studied the wax seal. Red, unbroken, the sigil of the Ministry of Mortality Oversight pressed deep. That was the stamp of an unquestioned death — not something handed out freely. Certainly not for a Hunter whose file hadn’t been combed over three times by three different clerks.

It stank of a cover-up.

When the last footsteps scraped their way out, Dirk stayed put a moment longer. Let the room breathe without him. Then he rose — slow, casual. Nobody turned. Why would they? The aisle bent into a narrow cut behind the altar. The air was warmer there, close. His coat caught on something rough in the wall, and a few steps later his shoulder thudded the opposite side. The space felt like it was trying to scrape him clean.

The hallway reeked of fresh mop water and bleach — the kind of overkill you got when someone didn’t trust their own cleaning. Lights buzzed overhead, steady but tired. A maintenance drone hobbled past on three legs, dragging a length of cable like it had been sentenced to walk it forever. Its display blinked: **ERROR: MAINTENANCE LOOP DETECTED.** Dirk didn’t slow down.

The prep rooms stank worse. Bleach, cold metal, and that stale bite you got from recycled air. Rows of drawers lined the wall, each tagged neat as teeth. One hung open, the label shouting *HUMAN EFFLUVIA (UNSORTED)*. Next to it, a cart held a box of cremation dust, the label *Generic Hunter Template* curling at the edges like it was trying to escape. In the corner, a form-filler bot slumped forward. Ink had bled down its casing into a sticky pool on the floor. One arm hung there, stamp dangling, like it had just given up halfway through.

A door turned up on his left — frosted glass, *RECORDS* stencilled across in fading paint. Light flickered inside, not in any kind of pattern, just enough to make the glass shiver. Dirk leaned in until he found a slim gap and caught a slice of what was going on inside.

Grint sat hunched over a terminal, shoulders drawn tight. His fingers jabbed at the keys like each press might be the one to work. The screen answered in angry red: **DENIED**. Again. And again.

Dirk pushed the door open with a slow creak.

Grint looked up and went pale. “You— you’re meant to be dead.”

Dirk shut the door behind him, letting a thin smile crawl across his face. It didn’t touch his eyes. “Yeah? And you’re meant to be competent. But here we are.”

Grint backed into a filing cabinet, hands twitching like they were reaching for an excuse he’d already misfiled. “This isn’t— it’s not what it looks like.”

Dirk’s gaze slid across the room, landing on a stack of data-slabs. His name sat on top. His ID. A digital death certificate. Stamped. Approved. Filed under *D7-Priority Clearance*. Witness field: blank.

A drawer sat open beside him. Requisition slips. All stamped *ASSETS RECYCLED*. Ration cards. Weapon permits. Implants. Faith chits. All reissued under IDs flagged deceased.

Dirk looked back at him. “You’ve been declaring Hunters dead and handing out their gear.”

Grint’s Adam’s apple bobbed. “It’s a clean system. We only use IDs that are already inactive. Efficient. Sustainable.”

“You buried me to balance your books.”

“The system isn’t perfect. But nobody notices. Nobody cares.”

“I noticed.”

The pause that followed was long enough for the room to hum.

Click.

Dirk didn’t turn. “Tell me that’s not the organist.”

“It is,” Grint muttered. “He’s also our crisis manager.”

Dirk turned slow. The organist wasn’t behind the keys now. He wore combat gloves, a hard stare, and the kind of expression you saw on someone who did side jobs for cash in brown envelopes. The shelf behind him was lined with hymnals glowing faintly under synth-ink prayers.

“I hate funerals,” Dirk said.

The shot came just as he dropped. Glass shattered. Dirk rolled, grabbed a casket dolly, and sent it crashing into the shooter. The man staggered, hit the lectern, and caught a metal urn square in the neck.

He crumpled, choking on whatever hymn was halfway out.

Dirk straightened, breathing hard. Grint was already edging toward the side door.

“I think we need to talk,” Dirk said, hand going to his sidearm.

Grint bolted. Dirk followed, moving with the spring of someone who’d spent years chasing trouble — and finding it on purpose.

Grint wasn’t quick, not in any way that counted, but fear had him sliding along like an eel dipped in tax fraud. He burst through a swinging bulkhead door — *ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTUM – STAFF ONLY* — and tore down a narrow hall where the floor tiles didn’t match, the lights couldn’t agree on whether they worked, and the file cabinets made the same noise as old priests with bad lungs. One cabinet wobbled when he clipped it, spilling a snow of requisition forms that swirled after him like paperwork hunting for a signature.

Dirk didn’t bother sprinting. The flechette pistol sat loose in his hand, boots hissing faintly on a floor washed in something far meaner than water. The coat flared with each stride, dragging a curl of smoke and the sharp bite of cleaner that had outstayed its welcome. Lights overhead flickered with every few steps, throwing him in and out of shadow — even the electrics seemed to take his side.

“Grint!” he called, the laugh under his voice sharp enough to cut. “If I have to run, someone’s paying overtime.”

The hallway ended at a service hatch with a frame buckled from age or anger — maybe both. Grint dived through it like a man falling on his own sword, clipped the far ladder, and rattled down into the dark. Dirk reached the edge in time to hear feet clanging against rusted rungs.

He exhaled through his teeth. “Of course it’s a ladder. Never a nuclear escalator when you actually want one.”

Still muttering, he swung over and started down.

The sublevel was colder. Older. Forgotten. Like stepping into the city’s forgotten crawlspace — the bit everyone pretended didn’t exist. The air was damp with the smell of paper turning to pulp, a dry undercurrent of dust hanging beneath it. Light strips clung weakly to the walls, flickering without reason, dying in one breath and flaring in the next. The cabinets stood in no neat order. Some hid under cracked plastic sheets, others slouched open, spilling the sour breath of whatever they’d been guarding. A sign overhead read: MORTALITY STORAGE – DO NOT REPROCESS WITHOUT FORM 83C.

Dirk’s boots splashed down into water that had been standing too long. The place stank of mildew, oil, and paper left to die in the wet. Overhead pipes dripped steadily, adding to the mess. Somewhere behind it all, the ventilation whined, not quite steady — like it wanted to quit but hadn’t worked up the nerve.

Grint, lungs burning, breath laboured, slumped into a chair that sat in the middle of the room like a grim parody of a gameshow contestants seat. His breath tore from his chest in great ragged heaves, age had not been kind to this man, arms hanging loose at his sides, as if they’d given up before the rest of him had.

“You weren’t supposed to see this,” he managed, clutching his ribs.

Dirk raised an eyebrow. “Because I was supposed to be dead?”

“Yes! You were declared! Signed, sealed, processed! Everything aboveboard!”

Dirk circled a crate, trailing a finger through the dust. “Except the part where I’m breathing. That’s a bit of a problem.”

Grint’s shoulders sagged deeper. “It started small. Unclaimed gear. IDs that’d gone quiet. Nobody asked questions. Then we found a way to speed it up. Flag a few Hunters as dead, push the forms through, scoop up the gear. Feed it into supply lines. Sell whatever’s extra to… other markets.”

“Black market enforcers. Or worse.”

Grint winced. “It wasn’t like that at first. Then your name came through.”

“From where?”

“Central. G-class override. No name attached. No trail to follow.”

“Bullshit.”

“I swear,” Grint said, voice breaking. “It passed all three checks. I thought you were gone.”

Dirk kept the pistol steady, the air between them thick and heavy.  
“And you just went along with it.”

Grint’s head dropped. “I buried the paperwork. Not the man.”

“The paperwork’s still talking,” Dirk said.

That’s when a new voice spoke from behind a stack of crates:  
“That’s because it hasn’t finished processing.”

Dirk spun, weapon up, hammer cocked.

A shape eased out from between the stacks, not rushing, not hiding — the kind of confidence that came pre-ironed. Longcoat, Ministry grey, the creases sharp enough to cut paper. A badge winked on her lapel, a stun baton riding her hip like it was itching for an excuse. The belt around her waist bristled with pouches and holsters, most of them probably full of legal trouble.

“Hello, Strangelove,” she said, voice smooth but with the faint hiss of static under it. “We’ve been watching this little funeral scam for a while. Shame you had to go and attend in person.”

Dirk kept his aim steady. “Ministry Oversight?”

Her smile twitched — not warmth, more like a cat twitching its tail. “Worse. Inventory Control.”

She came on slow, boots knocking out a neat rhythm on the metal floor. Eyes like frozen audits, the kind that never missed a typo.

“You’ve tripped a sanctioned salvage protocol. You’re off the books, untagged, and technically dead. Which means I could plant you here and not so much as nudge a disciplinary form.”

Dirk squeezed off a shot.

She moved quicker than anyone dressed that neatly had a right to, diving behind a filing cabinet as the flechettes chewed through dead shelving. The air bloomed with paper dust — decades of forms torn down to confetti. A red light spun overhead.

Somewhere up in the ceiling, alarms found their voice.

“UNREGISTERED ACTIVITY DETECTED IN MORTALITY ARCHIVE. PLEASE INITIATE END-OF-LIFE PROTOCOLS.”

Dirk ducked behind a crate marked RATION LOG – TERMINATED, coughing on the stale years pouring out of it. “This is your fix for a clerical error?!”

Her baton flared and spat a bolt that ripped a black scar across the floor, taking half a stack of Form 12 with it. The rest sagged into molten sludge.

“This was meant to be clean!” she shouted over the noise. “Nobody even liked you!”

“Mutual,” Dirk shot back, not really expecting it to help.

Grint, apparently remembering he existed, tried to crawl toward a side door. She clocked him, didn’t miss a beat — just snatched up a stapler and winged it. The thing hit him square in the temple, and he dropped like a bad budget request.

“Grint was sloppy,” she called. “You? You’re just a problem.”

Dirk aimed, squeezed — click.

He stared at the pistol like it had just stolen his drink. “Right. Monastery shootout. Didn’t restock.” He said it like it was an overdue bill. “Classic.”

She was already closing in, baton whining in that eager, electric way.

Dirk reached into his coat and came out with a prayer bead — blackened, hairline cracks glowing faintly, humming with heat and bad decisions. A little holy, a little unstable, and not built to pass inspection.

“You’re gonna love this part.”

He threw it without ceremony.

The blast was tight but mean, all fizzled faith and shoddy blessings. Metal groaned. Shelves folded. A few bulbs gave up the ghost at once. She went flying, coat flaring, into a stack of caskets stamped READY FOR DISPOSAL.

Dirk didn’t wait to see if she stayed down.

He bolted.

The darkness of the corridor swallowed him wholesale, each breath choked thick with dust, and the kind of industrial neglect you could taste on the back of your tongue. The archive howled behind him—sirens, fire, the crackle of paperwork dying too loudly for the calm a funeral home should project. Pages fluttered past like burnt leaves, glowing briefly before guttering out. Somewhere, a sprinkler gave a lazy cough, sprayed a few weak droplets, and decided that was enough effort for one day.

He shouldered through a reinforced door into what could only be a cremation overflow. The light was a sickly green that pulsed like a migraine. Rows of ancient incinerators crouched along the walls, rust bleeding from their seams. Some yawned open, cold and empty; others blinked ERROR or HELP in slow, hopeless pixels.

The acrid air clung to his skin, like an old lover he’d prefer to forget, the taste caught at the back of his throat, a sour ghost of old funerary incense.

The hatch behind him slammed open with a hydraulic hiss, the final rush of air from a dying body.

She stepped through, smoke trailing off her like some kind of cursed altar offering. The coat was scorched at the hem, sleeve torn to ribbons, but the baton in her hand still spat blue fire. Her eyes had gone hard—pure Ministry vengeance, dressed up with a barcode.

“Strangelove!” she roared, her voice hitting the walls like a thrown file box. “You’re unregistered, unclaimed, and unimportant!”

Dirk dropped behind a busted trolley stacked with urns. They rattled in protest. He popped his head out, smirked, and called, “And uninsured—don’t forget that part.”

Her answer was a bolt of static that turned the trolley into a storm of ceramic shards. Ash swirled in the air like fine snow. Dirk rolled clear, choking, spotted a coil of incense wire on a wall hook, and whipped it at her legs. It caught, tangled, and she went down hard. She tore free before he could close the gap, baton buzzing in her grip.

“This is your last audit!” she shouted, hauling herself upright.

Dirk upended a cart, spilling unmarked urns across the floor—ceramic clinking and shattering in a sound that felt too loud for the space. One burst at his boots, its contents hissing where they touched the small fire crawling along the far wall.

“Paper firetraps,” he muttered, and with a flick of his boot, kicked the grey spill into the open mouth of a live incinerator.

The fire leapt at the offering. Heat punched into the room. A pipe overhead—gas, embalming fluid, or something you didn’t want to think about—ruptured, spraying the ceiling. Flame caught with a hollow WHUMP that drove them both scrambling for cover.

She skidded, caught herself on a metal rail, the ends of her hair now flickering like a votive candle.

A voice from the ceiling spoke up, chipper in the worst way: “System overload detected. Combustion imminent.”

Dirk spun, scanning for any way out. That’s when he spotted Grint—blood on his face, eyes wide and glassy, crawling in through a side hatch like he was clawing his way toward a pension payout. The man looked half-dead already. Dirk thought about letting him finish the job, swore under his breath, and cut across the room. Sparks spat from a fuse box above, stinging his coat as he ducked past.

He hooked a hand in Grint’s collar and hauled him upright. Behind them, the cremation chamber’s backups roared awake, flooding the place with noise and fresh disaster. Fire jumped in new corners. The alarms hit a higher pitch. The sprinklers coughed out embalming foam instead of water—thick, greasy stuff that caught flame like it was holding a grudge.

The emergency exit was ahead, its metal skin scorched and rippled from the heat. The security panel beside it blinked a tired red. ACCESS DENIED. Fingerprint reader cracked, retina scanner hanging in molten drips.

Dirk sighed through his teeth, jammed his left cybernetic hand into the panel, and let the current do the arguing. The box spat sparks and went dark. Somewhere inside, something gave up. With a groan like a bad conscience, the door eased open just wide enough for one hunter and one woozy fraud case.

Dirk kicked it the rest of the way.

Outside, the storm had become one of those downpours even the rivers tried to avoid. Rain came in sideways, hammering the alley like the heavens were filing a complaint labelled “urgent”. Thunder rolled across the skies somewhere above, slow and deliberate a sky car was struck by an electrical discharge, its spiralling descent the sound of a long audit grinding toward its verdict.

Dirk staggered out first, dripping, smoking, and steaming in different places, none of them pleasant. Grint was dead weight at his side—unconscious again—so Dirk propped him against a rubbish bin stamped CONFIDENTIAL DISPOSAL and let his own lungs catch up.

From behind, the cremation wing of the formerly calm funeral home, let out a strained groan that turned to relief when a muffled *thumb* echoed from its depths. The back up crematory fuel must have caught, as flames punched upwards into the sky, the protestations of the dead. The conflagration took part of the roof with it, clearing the local pigeon population from the rafters. Gallows reach will be happy.

From somewhere inside, stubborn to the end, a printer kept feeding Form D7s straight into the fire.

Dirk spat soot, fished a Regalement Blend from his coat, and coaxed it alight with an unsteady thumb. The tip glowed, a tiny ember mirrored in the blaze eating the funeral home.

Beside him, Grint stirred, blinking at the inferno like it might still be part of a dream.

“You cremated the evidence,” Dirk said, smoke curling from his lips. “That’s what I call a clean exit strategy.”

He walked.

Not with any hurry, just the slow, stubborn pace of a man who’d been told to go home and decided to take the scenic route through every bad idea in the city. The streets shone like they’d been polished in moral grease, gutters fat with things no one had claimed since the last civil audit. Gallows Reach sulked on all sides, skyline twitching with neon laws that didn’t apply to the right people, and windows that winked out the second you looked like you might ask questions.

Rain needled his face, sharp as overdue fees, finding every tear in the coat and working them like a bill collector. It hung off the corners of his mouth, dripping down into a smirk that didn’t have much left to smile about.

A noodle stand steamed in the haze, run by a man with too many scars and not enough permits. A billboard across the street tried to sell him an end-of-life cremation plan, free loyalty badge included. Dirk gave it a nod. *Maybe next time.*

His boots squelched through the cracked slabs of Ministry-approved pavement, keeping time with the sort of rhythm you only get from a man who’s ignoring three different types of pain. He lit another Regalement Blend—probably the last one rattling in the pack, but that was a problem for Future Dirk. The smoke curled up into the mist, carrying the quiet resignation of a deadline no one ever planned to meet.

Somewhere in the back of his head, a thought tried to form. Something about cause and effect. About carrying spare ammo. About checking your own death certificate more often. It didn’t last long—most of his better ideas went that way—drowned out by the city, the taste of smoke, and the low hum of adrenaline still working its way out of his system.

He turned a corner and there it was.

Sanctuary Headquarters sat at the end of the block, low and mean, coughing smoke from a few fresh holes in its shell. The neon over the door flickered through rain: **WELCOME BACK, HUNTER**. Someone had added *FOR NOW* underneath in dripping red. Dirk figured it was either the work of a bored kid or someone with a grudge. Both were probably right.

Dirk took one last drag, rolled his shoulders, and walked through the doors. Back into the grinder. Back into the work. Some men looked for closure. Dirk Strangelove went after trouble—the kind you couldn’t put in triplicate and file away.

And trouble? Trouble had already started filling out the forms.

**Basic information:** Age: 32

**Diet:**

Mostly Mediterranean. I eat the same thing almost every day, only the quantities change depending on whether I'm bulking or cutting. It looks something like this:

* Breakfast: Eggs, cottage cheese, mozzarella, vegetables (and toast, for example, if I'm bulking)
* Lunch/Pre-workout meal: Chicken + rice + vegetables (beef instead of chicken once a week)
* Dinner: WPC/Skyr/Some fruit

I start each day with a cup of matcha (very rarely coffee), and I drink green tea throughout the day.

Between meals, I sometimes have a protein snack, like low-fat chips. etc.

**Supplements:**

* Morning (after breakfast)

Vitamin D + K, Omega-3, Coenzyme Q10, Vitamin C, Finasteride

* Midday

NAC, Quercetin + Bromelain, Creatine Monohydrate (non-training days)

* Before training:

Creatine Monohydrate, Citrulline, pre-workout stack

* Evening (after dinner/before bed)

MgZB (Magnesium + Zinc + Vitamin B), Potassium, Collagen, Biotin, Ashwagandha

Once or twice a week I add selenium, copper, and iron.

**Illnesses:**

* Asthma - something I've been struggling with since childhood. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. I take a medication called Asaris daily, which makes the symptoms disappear completely for a day (sometimes more).
* Androgenetic alopecia, very mild, I noticed that my temple started receding, so I started using finasteride (0.5 mg daily) and minoxidil to combat it - so far, I haven't experienced any side effects.
* Gray hair - I have a few scattered grays, but there's probably nothing I can do about them - I dye my hair with a gray remover every now and then.

**Lifestyle:**

* I work remotely in IT, earn a decent living, and I live relatively frugally, investing my surplus funds.
* After work, I spend a lot of time at the gym (4 workouts a week, I have a trainer who guides me).
* I try to be active every afternoon, even if I don't go to the gym (walking/biking/rollerblading).
* I have a girlfriend, and therefore have regular sex.

**Addictions:**

* None at all - I don't drink alcohol, smoke, or use drugs. I occasionally eat something sweet or high-calorie.
* I've even recently cut back on coffee – I've replaced it with good-quality matcha.
* Sometimes I have a weakness for protein-based sweets, which aren't always a healthy alternative.

**Skincare:**

* Morning - Moisturizing Cream with SPF 30, Zinc, Vitamins C and E
* Evening - Regenerating Cream with Retinol

But now on days 5 and 6 I've just had awful, awful anxiety like I could just burst to tears. I had one coffee in the morning like I usually do but I feel so much worse now for some reason. I don't really want anything, I only feel empty and filled with dread.

And to make it worse, at the same time my whole sex drive and downstairs feel like they just gave up. Dong feels shriveled, chilly and unresponsive. Had some morning wood but can't seem to keep the interest up for long. Things that would usually get me hard and aroused are now like ""nah don't really care""? It's really scaring me at the moment. Sex and passion are important to me so it's bizarre that I feel nothing right now.

I have doctor check-up next week about this but I'm really anxious about this feeling of dread and no lust with no clear benefits yet. Is this normal? Should sex drive come back at some point?

“I was trying to explain to my friend why he should get a grinder instead of just buying pre-ground coffee. I’d been using a portable electric grinder, the **OutIn Fino**, and I figured I’d just show him why it makes such a big difference.

I did a quick side-by-side test, and honestly, I was kind of blown away myself lol.

So I grabbed a bag of pre-ground stuff I had lying around and pitted it against a bag of whole beans of the exact same brand and origin that I ground fresh.

The results were pretty stark:

* The Smell: As soon as the grinder started, my kitchen just exploded with that amazing, sweet, nutty coffee smell. You know the one. The pre-ground bag? I got almost nothing, just a faint scent.
* The Look (Crema!): The shot from the fresh grounds was gorgeous. Thick, golden, syrupy crema that just sat there looking delicious. The pre-ground shot was... sad. The crema was thin and vanished in like 30 seconds.

[Photo by my daughter: The cup on the far left is from the fresh grounds, and the one on the far right is the pre-ground.](https://preview.redd.it/o54wmervtzhf1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a0791339bcf4abab7e15ff2b3f5772548f4d81d)

* The Taste: This is where it really hit home. The fresh-ground shot was sweet, full-bodied, and I could actually taste the flavor notes. The pre-ground one was just... 'coffee'. Flat, a bit harsh, and super forgettable. It tasted like it had its soul sucked out.

If you feel like your coffee is missing that ""wow"" factor, the answer is 100% a grinder.

You don’t need a bulky, complicated machine to get started. The **OutIn Fino** is compact, USB-C rechargeable, and delivers surprisingly great grind quality for espresso. It’s been my go-to for fresh coffee anytime, anywhere.""

1mlp5g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1mlp5g7/discover_if_the_best_liquid_laundry_detergent/,Discover if the Best Liquid Laundry Detergent from Arm Hammer Truly Delivers,"Using the Arm & Hammer 033200975809 liquid laundry detergent for a few weeks has been a surprisingly satisfying experience. I got the product primarily because my home is a hub of activity, and laundry is always an ongoing process. Between regular spills, mysterious kid stains, and gym clothes drenched in sweat, my laundry situation needed a reliable and efficient solution. This detergent, boasting 5 powerful cleaning benefits in one product, caught my attention. While it delivers on several promises admirably, it also presents a few quirks worth mentioning. Let’s dive into my experience with it.

**Powerful Stain Removal Capabilities**

Having kids around means grass stains, ketchup spills, and the occasional art experiment gone rogue will make their way onto their clothes. This product comes loaded with OxiClean stain fighters, which claim to target over 101 tough stains. From my observations, it lives up to this claim impressively. A particular instance involved a shirt doused in spaghetti sauce; I tossed it in the wash with this detergent, and to my amazement, the stain was entirely gone. The same happened when dealing with grease, coffee spills, and mud stains. If you need a detergent that fights serious messes, this one doesn’t disappoint.

**Brightens Colors and Whitens Whites**

Laundry tends to lose its vibrancy over time with some detergents, but this product genuinely revives colors while keeping white fabrics bright. I have a set of white towels that somehow always end up dull after a few washes with other detergents. After using this, they came out looking cleaner and fresher than they’d been in months. My daughter's brightly colored dresses also retained their richness, which was genuinely impressive.

**Low-Sudsing and HE Washer Friendly**

Unlike certain detergents that create a bubble-fest in the washing machine, the Arm & Hammer liquid detergent is low-sudsing, which makes it a smooth operator for both standard and HE washing machines. I’ve got an HE washer and always worry about detergents clogging sensors or leaving residues, but this formula rinses away cleanly, leaving no trace. It’s reassuring knowing I can use it in cold water settings too, which is perfect for energy-saving households.

**Highlights**

- Excellent stain-fighting power, tackling diverse messes easily  
- Keeps whites whiter and colors really vibrant  
- Low-sudsing formula makes it ideal for both HE and standard machines  
- Works effectively even in cold water

**Fresh and Clean Scent**

The scent of this detergent could be considered a gold mine for those who love fresh-smelling clothes. After each wash, my laundry has a pleasant, lingering fresh scent that isn’t too overwhelming. Even gym clothes, with their terrible odor battle post-workout, came out smelling like they’d been through a spa experience. That said, individuals sensitive to strong smells might find it too potent.

**Drawbacks**

Not everything shines flawlessly with this detergent. While my overall experience has been positive, there are some aspects to critique.  

- The container design isn’t user-friendly; the spout sometimes dribbles detergent after pouring  
- Can be challenging to use for people with smaller hands since the 166.5-fl-oz bottle is quite heavy  
- The scent, though fresh, might not cater to those who prefer a fragrance-free alternative  

**Packaging and Aesthetic Drawbacks**

If there’s one thing I’d really want to bring to the manufacturer’s attention, it’s the packaging. Lugging around the 10.4-pound bottle isn’t the easiest task, especially for someone like my mother, who found it a hassle to pour without a bit of struggle. The spout design could also use improvement to minimize messy drips after dispensing the detergent. While this may sound minor, it can get frustrating over repeat uses.

**Product Competitors**

Having tried a number of detergents in the past, including Tide and Persil, this Arm & Hammer product certainly holds its ground. What makes it stand out compared to its competitors is its dual-action of stain removal and fabric brightening combined with affordability. In contrast, Tide excels in consistency of performance but tends to run on the pricier side, and Persil, while effective at stain-removal, doesn’t always deliver the same fragrance punch. However, when it comes to packaging, Tide Pods are leagues ahead in convenience compared to this large bottle.

**True Value**

Considering its performance and the volume you receive, this detergent leans heavily on the budget-friendly side. Offering up to 128 washes per bottle is fantastic for households doing laundry frequently. It doesn’t feel like you’re sacrificing effectiveness for cost-saving, which is a strong plus. Many costlier alternatives fail to bring this mix of quality and affordability to the table.

I have been getting allot of contacts recently and all of them are saying almost always the exact same things

""have a good weekend""  
""I'm fine, which city are you in?""  
""I just left your country, I am from London and plan to go back next month. Can we meet? Do you like tea or coffee?""

I think these are victims of ""pig butchering"" and actually needs help so i had AI create some short questions or response answers to this.  
  
I think these victims do not even know how to get out of the situation they are stuck in.

With this, I hope we can save some of these people.

Here are three copy-paste options, from subtle to direct:

1. Subtle, plausible small talk “Hey, if your work makes you chat with people here and it does not feel safe, I hope you are ok. You deserve safety. If you ever need help, when you can, search for ‘IOM migration assistance’ or ‘A21 helpline’. I will not ask questions.”
2. Clear, non-accusatory “I do not know your situation, and I will not press. If you are working under pressure or without your passport, there are groups that help. When you have private internet, search: IOM migration assistance, A21 helpline, or ‘anti trafficking hotline’ plus your country.”
3. Very direct, still low risk “If you are not free to leave your job or building, you are not alone. When safe, look up IOM, A21, or ‘migrant help hotline’ in your country. Use a private device if possible. I will not ask for details.”

Do’s

* Keep it short. No questions about their location, employer, or documents.
* Send once. If they acknowledge or hint yes, end the chat and report the profile to Tinder.
* If they share clear trafficking details, screenshot, then report to the platform. If there is imminent danger, contact local authorities.

Don’ts

* Do not set “codes,” ask them to prove anything, or propose escape plans.
* Do not move to WhatsApp or click links.
* Do not send NGO links that look like instructions from you. Names are safer than URLs.

1mlp4sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1mlp4sb/im_struggling_to_enjoy_warframe/,I'm struggling to enjoy Warframe,"I've returned to Warframe after quiting when 1999 lunched, the so-called ""Biggest update"" that basically added skins, 10 minute quest compared to hour long past actually memorable stuff like duviri or new war... and Ofcourse new missions that 60% of the time will break rendering them incompleteble.

Things changed right? Right? The slammer bug sending you on a magical journey f knows where is still there. The horse duviri bug doing the same is still there, motorcycle is the worse  k drive and it ignored physics conservation of momentum (Things in motion tend to stay in motion, not dead stop after grazing anything)

I want to be positive about the game, I see that there's attempts everywhere to make the game more skill based than warframe aoe afk. There's that whole planet in base game that's like an area clearly meant to be like Unreal Tornament or something, but in there you're just eather afk aoe winning or running around the map looking for face to shoot. There's these cards that promotes and rewards strategy and skill, and the incanor weapons are something I'm enjoying more than in should, but... If you're not abusing quick charge fire rate to proc incanor fast they aren't very viable and that's not the fault of the weapon, but rather enemy design. A lot of enemies don't aim, but instead use ""Get character location, get mine, if line of sight true deal damage"" rendering cover hugging, dodging, bullet jumping over and so on not viable for avoiding damage. If anything your are better of running at the enemy than trying to evade the attack, plus clostraphobic map design is constantly fight against your own move set...

Warframes themselves... Where do I start... I have tasted the power of Immortal Kulev and I want less. My most memorable part of a game is when my operator would speak saying  ""My Warframe is strong"" as in I'm not strong, the tool i have is, showing this overreliance and I wish I could turn this back on. Most games you are in and out of a fight, like you can watch anime on a phone and play the game or do something else and with stronger warframes this is worse and worse, it does the job, not you and I can see the game developers doing i assume their best to change that with warframes and their less godlike nature, like this C-9 sniper, that i feared would be godlike, but he's ironically most balanced thing in this game, aka his kit doesn't make him immortal alone, like again... Kulev... But unless you're using cards to effectively make him immortal or some stand behind wall sniper nonsense abusing his kit, the game itself doesn't feel like it fits him.

The best comparison would be helldivers. Compared to Warframe you die in one or two shots, you can play slow tank role, but you can't just walk straight at the enemy not taking covers, flanks, kiting the enemy fire. The game rewards you so mutch more in terms of fun value, rewarding strategy, accuracy, mechanical skills by putting you in this risk-reward gameplay while Warframe at it's core feels like you're supposed to feel good because number is bigger... number... ""I cast zone of litteral death, now excuse me while I f-off to drink coffee"" gameplay isn't gameplay... Game is happening but no play is being made. 

Many warframes are seen as bad become they don't have self mortality or everything dies now stuff in their kit, some status effects are seen as just damage number increases instead of added tools, like stun. A Warframe with out any abilities should be a viable steel path option, but maps, enemies, game mechanics are preventing positioning and strategy to overcome chalanges. Best example is duviri steel path circuit where people often QUIT after the first rotation just because they didn't landed a broken frame or broken gun they had modded... sometimes I would land on a base Titania that again, warframe plays the game for me so I can easily get wins. Or some other broken frames... Or a frame I had modded... and other time you would die because your warframe isn't carrying your ass... Way too mutch is relaying on having broken stuff in your kit.

People aren't talking their time enjoying the game. This is best seen after every mission end players race for the exit, often even before objective is completed. Why is that bad? By it's is not, but it shows that players where not in that mission for the fun of it or they might consider keep going, or getting more kills or something. So if they didn't do the mission for the fun then why? One guy kept yapping to be about how you grind this and that than sell on market place than do more and sell more... Excuse me are we playing stock market simulator here?! It's like people play this game to grind so they could grind more for the grind... Grind for grind, jumping from one spot to another, but where's the game? I don't care about any of the grind or plat shit. I want game from my game. I play on steel path and intentionally avoid getting stronger in terms of immortality or broken weapon mods aside from condition overload for obvious reason, because i value games based on fun value and I'm failing to enjoy this one. It should be more fun than it with all the options you have, but i mainly enjoyed duviri and frankly im sick of seen the same map over and over again. ",0,1754745197.0,Warframe,9,0.3,False

1mlp2ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mlp2ev/uncover_if_the_best_coffee_maker_is_the_ninja/,Uncover If the Best Coffee Maker Is the Ninja CFP201 Today,"If you're anything like me, mornings don't really start until that first cup of coffee is brewing. When I picked up the Ninja CFP201, I realized just how spoiled I’d been by my old, simpler coffee maker that lacked half the savvy features of this one. Setting it up felt like stepping into the future of home brewing, especially with its dual functionality for using both coffee grounds and pods. If you're on the fence about whether this machine is for you, buckle in while I break it all down.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This thing looks sleek and modern in black, with a slightly bulky build that might not work for those tight on counter space. Measuring just over 15 inches tall, it’s a bit of a tank. While the coffee maker doesn't exactly scream “compact,” every inch feels justified by the array of features packed in. I’ve tested plenty of coffee makers that felt flimsy, but the Ninja CFP201 offers solid durability and a robust premium feel. The removable 60-ounce reservoir isn’t just functional, it’s a lifesaver when you don’t want to haul the entire machine to the sink for a refill. Plus, the design of the buttons and settings layout is intuitive, which made navigating its many features simpler than I expected.

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
Using this machine daily, I’ve been surprised by the consistently rich flavor it produces. You can choose from three brew styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. Classic worked perfectly for my morning routine, though for an afternoon pick-me-up, the Over Ice feature delivered an iced coffee that didn’t taste like bland, watered-down regret—which is usually my experience with iced brews at home. Testing it with both coffee grounds and pods, it really impressed me how it catered equally well to both without compromising the final brew. If you're used to drip coffee machines for a crowd or single-serve pod systems for convenience, this aims to address both seamlessly.

[Check Ninja CFP201 price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b08qzxfskp/)

**Versatility in Brewing Options**  
With nine ground brew sizes ranging from a single cup up to a full 12-cup carafe, the sheer flexibility here is stellar. Whether I’m brewing just for myself or hosting my caffeine-loving friends, it scales without breaking stride. Pod users also get to play with four brew sizes (6 to 12 ounces), which makes it easier to tailor the output to your preferred intensity. The added perk? It has a delayed brew function. Before going to bed, I set everything up, hit Delay Brew, and woke up to the heavenly aroma of fresh coffee filling the air. Absolute game-changer.

**Strengths**  
- Provides the convenience of brewing both grounds and pods.  
- Three brew styles ensure customization for every taste preference.  
- Removable water reservoir simplifies refilling.  
- Delay Brew and warming plate keep coffee hot and fresh for hours.  

**Areas of Concern**  
While I do appreciate everything the Ninja CFP201 offers, there are some quirks worth mentioning.  
- The machine is substantially larger than standard pod brewers, so it’s not ideal for small kitchens.  
- Cleaning the pod adapter can be tricky, and it required some extra care I didn’t anticipate.  
- The warming plate is fantastic for keeping a carafe warm, but it doesn’t address single-cup brews, which cool down faster.

**Product Competitors**  
Having tested similar coffee makers in this category, I couldn’t help but compare it to the Keurig K-Duo. Both offer flexibility for pods and carafes, but I noticed the Ninja CFP201 delivers better flavor depth, particularly with the Rich setting. Another tough contender is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which comes at a slightly lower price but misses out on features like customizable brew strength or Over Ice brewing. Where the Ninja product shines is in its versatility and its ergonomic water reservoir, which makes it leagues more user-friendly than many counterparts.

**Cost Efficiency**  
At first glance, you might balk at the investment, but the Ninja CFP201 delivers plenty of bang for the buck with its dual system and array of brew options. The value here lies in its ability to handle the needs of a multi-person household just as well as it caters to a single, on-the-go user. Considering I now brew less coffee needlessly and avoid last-minute coffee shop runs, this machine ultimately saves me money over time.

1mloz3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mloz3i/explore_if_the_ninja_es601_coffee_maker_redefines/,Explore if the Ninja ES601 Coffee Maker Redefines Home Espresso Quality in This Review,"Testing out the Ninja ES601, I dove into my daily caffeine ritual with loads of excitement. As a coffee enthusiast who occasionally dabbles in amateur barista-ing, this 3-in-1 machine ticked a lot of boxes just from the spec sheet. Espresso, drip coffee, and cold brew all under one roof? That sounded perfect for the picky coffee drinker in me. My mornings (and afternoons, and let’s face it – evenings) involve at least two cups, so this machine had its work cut out. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker flaunts a sleek design with a modern silver finish. Its compact form factor made it easier to allocate counter space in my already cluttered kitchen. Measuring approximately 13x13x15 inches, its size felt practical rather than overbearing. What stood out to me immediately was the attention to detail. Components like the integrated tamper and funnel have dedicated storage areas, keeping everything tidy and accessible. However, at 31.7 pounds, it's no lightweight, and moving it around requires a bit of muscle. 

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
Getting hands-on with the brewing process was where the fun began. This machine caters to flexibility, from double or quad espresso shots to six different drip coffee sizes (ranging up to 18 ounces). The rapid cold brew option seals the deal for someone like me who often craves iced coffee without the patience to steep overnight. Its Barista Assist technology deserves applause, seamlessly guiding me like a pro through grind settings and brew adjustments to achieve just the right flavors.   

[Check Ninja ES601 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d45pk5v4/)  

**Integrated Grinder and Grind Control**  
One of my favorite features has to be the premium conical burr grinder with its 25 grind settings. Morning me isn't always fully awake, and the built-in weight-based dosing system eliminated a lot of the guesswork. The precision this provides is impressive when compared to machines that grind based solely on time. I experimented with my beloved dark roast beans, and the results consistently hit the sweet spot pour after pour. The timesaving aspect of not fiddling with separate grinders alone is worth highlighting. 

**Dual Froth System for Milk-Based Drinks**  
Calling all latte and cappuccino fans! The hands-free frother makes creating microfoam almost idiot-proof. I tested it with both dairy and almond milk to see how it handled non-dairy alternatives, and the results were shockingly good. Four frothing presets – for steamed milk, thin froth, thick froth, and cold foam – spared me the usual trial and error. My lattes came out café-worthy each time, though I’ll admit that thick froth mode did require a little patience. 

**Key Benefits**  
- The machine reduces guesswork with Barista Assist technology.  
- Built-in grinder and weight-based dosing streamline the brewing experience.  
- The flexibility to choose brewing temperatures accommodates varying bean roasts.  
- Built-in storage compartments promote neatness.  

**Critiques**  
- At over 31 pounds, its heft can be cumbersome to move around.  
- The included instruction manual, while thorough, could be clearer for first-timers.  
- Preset froth options, though efficient, lack the motion of ‘manual’ frothing for highly particular users.  

**Comparing Against Industry Competitors**  
Stacking up the Ninja ES601 with competitors like the Breville Bambino and De’Longhi La Specialista was intriguing. While Breville excels with its compact size and simplicity, it lacks the versatility for three brewing styles that I found priceless here. De’Longhi dazzled with exquisite build quality but came at a steeper price. The Ninja system fell somewhere pleasantly in the middle—offering impressive versatility with features like the assisted tamp and customizable grind settings, all while staying in a reasonable price tier.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
A device juggling espresso shots, cold brew, and drip coffee effectively delivers immense bang for your buck. Compared to splurging on three separate machines or café trips, this machine pays for itself over time. Plus, the design marries convenience and performance, offering excellent value in a crowded market segment. That said, certain niche features like individualized cold brew strength could see room for further refinement.

I have some preferences of course, some routines. Some examples:
- I do the grocery shopping on Friday after work, I go to the grocery shop by foot and use a trolley for my groceries (I love my grocery store, it's a smaller one but has everything, I love my trolley too)
- I don't want to tidy up the kitchen and table until we're done eating, for me that's a stressful activity whereas eating together is relaxing and ""fun"" so if I have to interrupt the fun to do something stressful then I have a hard time having fun again, the meal is ruined basically

My boyfriend doesn't care which day of the week we go grocery shopping, doesn't like to carry my trolley but he doesn't want me to always be the one to pull the groceries home, and he's the kind of person who will immediately tidy everything up, including mid meal (like, between main and fruit or between fruit and coffee), it actually stresses him out not to.

In these situations I don't know how to react. He's never doing anything wrong. If he's busy on Friday and tries to insist I don't go doing the shopping alone as some things are heavy, he's just trying to be kind (I will usually still go alone, maybe let him buy the heavy items separately later). Tidying up after eating, also something sensible to do, and it stresses him out not to, who decides who should or shouldn't be stressed? The trolley, he finds it unstable and gets frustrated with it, but again, he's trying to share the burden of something. So I try to just let him do his thing too. If he's rinsing dishes between main and fruit, I let him, but it makes me very nervous sometimes.

I feel frustrated by not being able to adhere to my routines and sometimes this create a nervousness I can't shake and which then dampens the mood. Either I suppress it, or I'll be grumpy for hours or until we've talked through how it makes me feel.

I don't feel entitled to ask him to fully stop doing what he's doing, to 100% do things my way (these are some examples but there's more).

I don't want him to carry the full burden of this, but I'm finding it very annoying to absorb the blunt from it too.

We've talked about it and it has actually resulted in him being hyper vigilant and supposing I'm annoyed by thing A, so he stops doing it, whereas thing A was great, or I hadn't noticed, and the annoyance he had perceived in the instance that made him stop A had nothing to do with him or housekeeping.

1mloyff,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mloyff/can_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_chulux_fit/,Can the best single serve coffee maker CHULUX fit your lifestyle?,"**Compact Design and Convenience**  
The CHULUX CL-KM807-W caught my eye instantly with its minimalist design and functionality. This slim, single-serve coffee maker slides effortlessly into even the tiniest of spaces in my kitchen, thanks to its 4-inch wide profile. I could place it in my crowded office work desk, and it still didn’t feel obtrusive. A notable feature is its portability — the lightweight, compact structure made it easy to bring along on a weekend camping trip. During testing, I appreciated the thoughtful details, like the removable drip tray that accommodates mugs up to 7.3 inches tall, making it versatile enough for my travel mug and a standard coffee cup. 

**Straightforward Operation**  
What really stood out is how foolproof this coffee maker is to use. There's just one button to press — simplicity at its finest. Insert a K-cup pod or, if you're feeling adventurous, your own coffee grounds with a reusable filter. Once I pressed the button, it brewed quickly, reaching the perfect 190°F in roughly two minutes. Whether I needed a 6-ounce quick shot for an energy boost or wanted a leisurely 12-ounce brew to sip, the adjustable settings delivered every time. Maintenance was equally simple; cleaning the drip area was hassle-free, and the water reservoir was conveniently wide and two inches deep, making refills less messy.

**Energy Efficiency at Its Best**  
The auto-shutoff feature absolutely nailed it for me. I tend to leave appliances running by mistake, so this safeguard not only saved me from unnecessary electrical waste but also gave me peace of mind. Despite being compact, the machine doesn’t skimp on power, and each brewing session was energy efficient without compromising on coffee quality.

**Positives**  
- Compact 4-inch width perfect for small spaces like dorms and RVs  
- Quick 2-minute brewing to ideal temperature  
- Auto-off feature for added energy savings  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Limited functionality above 4,000 feet elevation  
- Requires regular descaling to prevent clogging, especially in hard water areas  

[Find the best price for CHULUX CL-KM807-W on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0db8dnfx2/)

**Innovative Features for Flavor Enhancement**  
I was intrigued by the unique 4-hole needle system, which truly elevated the flavor experience. Compared to generic single-serve brewers, this technology seemed to extract a deeper aroma and taste. Every brew felt richer and more satisfying, especially when using higher-quality K-cups or fresh grounds. The compact build likely pairs this feature with high efficiency, creating a machine that punches well above its weight in performance.

**Competitors**  
In the realm of single-serve coffee makers, there’s some stiff competition. Take Keurig K-Mini, for example. While it offers similar compactness and ease of use, CHULUX edges out with its 4-hole needle system for flavor extraction. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, on the other hand, stands out for dual brewing options (pod & carafe). However, the CHULUX Coffee Maker comes across as more portable and energy-savvy, making it ideal for those always on the go. It's also priced more competitively without feeling cheap in construction.

**Value for Money**  
For a coffee maker that offers portability, reliability, and innovative brewing, the CHULUX CL-KM807-W is a worthwhile investment. It's hard to beat the convenience and flexibility of this slim coffee maker, particularly in settings like a small apartment, cramped office, or even an RV where every inch of space counts. While the maintenance requirements might seem a bit tedious for some, the quality of coffee you get from this machine makes it well worth the effort.

* Can I come and go, if I have a ticket?
* Can I bring a shoulder bag w/water, etc? (nothing illegal)
* Do people show up right at the start, or do thing get going later?
* Parking?
* Schedule of events? (I can't find one on the AS220 site)
* IS THERE COFFEE

Also, should I do anything between these two potential realities:

* I might be doing this solo
* I might have a 11yo/15yo/16yo in tow

Any other suggestions/tips?

Now I know I'm looking back with rose tinted glasses and it was certainly shite in alot of ways but typically you did whatever the task in front of you was. In cafes especially you were either on the till, working the coffee machine or doing the cleaning.

If it's not having to approve the self service machines it's some Uber eats or similar guy coming in to collect. They've also got to pick these orders and deal with parcels and whatnot

I asked for a specific chocolate tart and was given an almond tart instead. When I went to change it, his attitude was dismissive. The food in the display didn’t seem well kept and it isnt good at all.

Youssef also made unprofessional comments to other customers – I even heard him tell one to “jm3 rask m3ana”, and the guy almost started a fight with him because of what he said, and this is not how you speak to clients.
Other clients were also complaining.

I ordered a coffee that never arrived. At that point, I just paid for the tart and left.

This search began as a casual inquiry but has since evolved into a matter of personal and, perhaps, existential significance.

Mr.T is known for his multifaceted personal history:

	•	Former student in Génie aérospatial at Polytechnique Montréal, where his academic precision suggested a mind capable of crafting intricate Geometry Dash levels.

	•	Publicly associated with the music of Blood Orange, whose atmospheric melodies may influence his in-game aesthetic choices.

	•	Owner of Nana by Émile Zola — the exact edition containing 531 pages, a number that might well be a cipher.

	•	Anecdotal evidence confirms that, in his youth, Mr.T  was observed smelling his own feet; I have no doubt this behavioral quirk could manifest as an Easter egg in his username.

	•	His fragrance of choice remains classified, but testimonies suggest a scent “reminiscent of bergamot, regret, and something marine.”

Initial attempts relied on conventional data-mining techniques:
	•	Scraping Geometry Dash leaderboards for any handles containing “Titou,” “Twotee,” or related variants.
	•	Cross-referencing timestamps with his known activity patterns — including classes at Polytechnique and social media silence periods.
	•	Analyzing lyrical themes in Blood Orange tracks recently streamed on his accounts.

When these methods failed, I turned to less orthodox strategies:
	•	Counting the number of Nana pages as rhythmic intervals and applying them as coordinates in the Geometry Dash level browser.
	•	Constructing a scent profile of his perfume to narrow down servers with a “marine” or “citrus” aesthetic.

My dreams are now pixelated. I see waveforms where there are none. Every cube I pass on the street feels like it could jump if I just timed it right.

Yesterday, while pouring coffee, I realized the splash pattern formed the letters “T” and “G.” Coincidence? Or an encoded hint?

I caught myself muttering “Blood Orange, page five hundred and thirty-one” repeatedly on the metro. The woman beside me moved to another seat. I cannot blame her.

The username remains undiscovered. But I know — I know — it’s out there. Lurking. Waiting. It may not be a name at all. It may be a number. Or a smell.

Until then, I will keep watching. Listening. Counting.
Geometry Dash is no longer a game to me. It is the air I breathe.

# Best Organic Half and Half 2025: Reviews & Top Brands

Organic half and half has become a staple in many households,offering a creamy,lighter alternative to conventional cream for coffee,cooking,and baking. As more consumers prioritize health and sustainability, the demand for organic options has surged. This review provides an in-depth look at the best organic half and half products available in 2025,evaluating their quality,taste,and brand reputation. We'll help you navigate the choices and find the perfect match for your needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of organic half and half hinges on several key features that contribute to its taste, texture, and overall nutritional profile. Understanding these aspects can empower you to make informed decisions when selecting the right product.

**Organic Certification:** The most critical aspect is the USDA organic certification.This guarantees that the milk used to produce the half and half comes from cows raised without synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs).It also ensures humane animal treatment and sustainable farming practices. Look for the USDA organic seal on the packaging to confirm its authenticity.

**Fat Content:** Half and half, by definition, is a blend of milk and cream. Typically, it contains between 10.5% and 18% milkfat. This fat content influences the richness and creaminess of the final product. Different brands may vary slightly within this range, impacting how it performs in your coffee or recipes. Some brands clearly state the exact percentage on the label, while others provide a general range.

**Ingredients List:** A shorter ingredients list usually indicates a purer product. Ideally, organic half and half should contain only organic milk and organic cream, possibly with a stabilizer like gellan gum to prevent separation.Avoid products with added sugars, artificial flavors, or other unnecessary additives.Scrutinize the ingredients list to ensure you're getting a clean, natural product.

**Pasteurization Method:** Pasteurization is crucial for safety and shelf life, but the method used can subtly affect taste and texture. ultra-pasteurized (UHT) half and half undergoes a higher-temperature process, extending its shelf life but potentially altering the flavor profile, making it slightly sweeter or cooked tasting. regular pasteurization (HTST) uses a lower temperature and may preserve a more natural, fresh taste.

**Packaging:** sustainable packaging is increasingly vital to consumers. look for brands that use recyclable cartons or bottles, minimizing their environmental impact. Some companies are also exploring innovative packaging solutions like plant-based materials or refillable containers. The packaging not only affects the habitat but can also contribute to the product's shelf life and preservation of quality.

**Source of Milk:** knowing where the milk comes from can also influence your purchasing decision. Some brands highlight the specific farms or regions they source from, allowing consumers to support local or regional agriculture. transparency about sourcing builds trust and allows consumers to make informed choices aligned with their values.

## Core Benefits

Organic half and half offers several practical benefits that appeal to health-conscious consumers and culinary enthusiasts alike. Its versatility and improved nutritional profile make it a valuable addition to the kitchen.**Enhanced Flavor and Richness:** Organic half and half adds a creamy richness to coffee, tea, and other beverages without the higher fat content of traditional cream. This allows you to enjoy a fuller flavor and more satisfying texture without excessive calories. The subtle sweetness and smooth consistency enhance the overall drinking experience.

**Versatile Culinary Ingredient:** Beyond beverages, organic half and half can be used in various recipes, from soups and sauces to desserts and baked goods. It adds a velvety texture and subtle richness to dishes,elevating their flavor profile. Its ability to thicken and bind ingredients makes it a valuable ingredient for both savory and sweet preparations.

**Lower Calorie Alternative:** Compared to heavy cream, organic half and half contains significantly fewer calories, making it a healthier option for those watching their weight. This allows you to indulge in creamy treats and flavorful recipes without compromising your dietary goals. The reduced calorie count makes it a guilt-free addition to your daily meals.

**Support for Sustainable agriculture:** Choosing organic half and half supports sustainable farming practices that prioritize environmental health and animal welfare. This means reducing the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, promoting biodiversity, and ensuring humane treatment of animals. By purchasing organic products,you contribute to a more ethical and environmentally responsible food system.

**Reduced Exposure to Harmful Chemicals:** Organic certification ensures that the milk used in the half and half is free from synthetic hormones, antibiotics, and pesticides. This reduces your exposure to potentially harmful chemicals and supports a healthier lifestyle. Choosing organic options minimizes the risk of ingesting residue from conventional farming practices.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of organic half and half can raise several questions. Here are answers to some common inquiries:

**What is the difference between half and half and cream?**

**Can I use organic half and half in place of milk or cream in recipes?**

1. Removing much of the false ceiling that was installed by the previous owners because it makes the ceiling so low that it feels claustrophobic. What sort of lighting would you recommend we replace it with? We'd like a mix of task lighting and accent lighting. We do want the place to be bright enough to get stuff done. I don't like the existing square lights. We live in a very humid country - hence the ceiling fans. Thinking of removing the one in the study area but leaving the one in the sitting room area. Thoughts?
2. What's a good way to light up the 'walkway' where the first photo is taken from? In other words how can I light up a stretch of living room space? Track lights? Any alternatives?
3. There is an exposed structural beam above what will be the dining area so we were thinking of keeping a false ceiling over the dining table to demarcate the dining space.
4. Does our furniture setting (couch in blue, arm chairs in red, small coffee table in the middle, bookshelf behind the arm chairs) make sense? Any other suggestions.

Short(?) story time:
Today is the freshmen-parent’s orientation for CRS, inalok ako ng mom ko to drink coffee cause she didn’t get enough sleep, and I agreed kasi same, so ayon, nag frappe ako on an empty stomach, which I forgot was a big nono kasi now ko lang siya ginawa since I don’t usually drink coffee, then fastforward a couple of hours later, nanikip talaga sikmura ko nung nag lunch na kami ng blockmates, I only had about 2-3 bites of chicken n rice sa food court ng The One Tower, then since may isa pa kaming orientation later in the afternoon, otw na kami sa smdp, kulong kulo na talaga sikmura ko and ayon, iniisip ko nalang kung nasan pinakamalapit na CR sa smdp + near sa room ng orientation in case naduduwal duwal nako, so ayon, sinamahan ako ng blockmate ko and a senior sa UST Health Services since I’ve mentioned that I felt veryy unwell (tyL di ako nasuka sa room) and otw sa building ng health services, nasuka ako sa may kanal, my blockmate said na siya nalang sasama sakin the whole trip since my senior also had to handle the orientation and had to go back, I felt bad kasi they were missing out sa orientation because of me kaya I hoped it wouldn’t take long and gagaan agad pakiramdam ko, my senior also mentioned that medyo mahaba talaga process sa UST Health Services, so ayon, nung pumunta ako sa information desk, walang wala na talaga akong boses when the guy asked me kung ano yung problema ko sa katawan, then medyo na shookt ako nung tinaasan niya ako na di niya marinig, kasi di naman ako bingi, I really tried na lakasan yung boses ko pero wala na talaga akong lakas non, so my blockmate assisted me, I thought na baka lumabas nalang kami ng campus para bumili ng gamot on our own, pero pinapunta na ako sa nurse, then she assessed me, she was veryyy kind, mahinahon makipagusap and mararamdaman mo talaga yung compassion niya, then pinadala na ako kay doc, she was very attentive and explained to me in full detail why I was experiencing the pain, what not to do, what to do, ano yung hiyang sakin na gamot, basta, yung reseta talaga back to back with full instructions and may indicator pa sa gilid kung para saan yung specific na gamot na yon, then I took the medicine to ease my dizziness and stomach ache, and ayon, they’ve also set a timer to see if I feel better and if pwede na ako ipabalik sa orientation and monitored me all throughout my short stay, nagsuka ulit ako pero I felt better, medyo corny pero even though mas malala yung pagsuka ko sa bathroom, there was really a sense of compassion and empathy present sa kanila (si doc and si nurse) kaya ayon, before they’ve allowed me and my blockmate to go back to the orientation, they’ve mentioned na open sila until 7 pm today and more than happy to assist me again, and ayon, I took the time para manghingi ng staff feedback/rating form and siempre mataas rating nila with matching praise sa comments (except talaga don sa nasa information kiosk, nasa harap pa niya talaga yung box for submitting the form) and I’ve decided na rin to brave through the kirot and dikitan nalang talaga ng hot compress yung stomach ko the whole orientation^^

anyways, yon lang naman, nakauwi na ako, and sinamahan din ako ni blockmate and ng mother niya since along the way naman yung bus namin pauwi (2 hours away pa kami from
Manila)^^

TL;DR: Thank you sa kind nurse and doctor sa UST Health Services, I’m not sure if I can disclose your names, along with the supladong someone sa information kiosk, and thank you rin sa blockmate ko and sa mom niya, like it hasn’t been a full week and I really do feel welcomed, asides from the 
roarientation + freshie walk + concert, other events, and orientations for the past few days, it would always be days like these that’ll remind me that compassion and empathy goes a long way and acts of kindnesses will always be cherished, and I’m happy that despite being a freshmen I’ve already somehow found this feeling in UST<33

# Best Bulk Heavy Cream 2025: Ultimate Buying Guide

Heavy cream is an indispensable ingredient for home cooks, professional chefs, and food manufacturers alike. Whether you're crafting decadent desserts, enriching savory sauces, or stabilizing whipped toppings, the quality and supply of your heavy cream can significantly impact the final product. Buying in bulk can be a cost-effective solution, but it's essential to choose the right product to meet your needs for flavor, texture, shelf life, and overall value. This guide provides a complete overview of the best bulk heavy cream options available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision.

## Key Features analysis

The selection of bulk heavy cream involves careful consideration of several factors. We've analyzed the options available, focusing on the features that impact quality, usability, and storage.

**Fat Content:** The percentage of milkfat is a crucial determinant of heavy cream's richness and stability.

heavy cream, by definition, typically contains between 36% and 40% milkfat. This high fat content is what allows it to whip into stiff peaks and contributes to its smooth, creamy texture. Lower fat percentages may result in a less stable product that doesn't whip as reliably or hold its shape well. When buying in bulk, it's important to verify the listed fat content to ensure it aligns with your intended use.

**Pasteurization Method:** Ultra-pasteurization (UHT) significantly extends shelf life, but it can also slightly alter the flavor.

Ultra-pasteurized (UHT) heavy cream is heated to a higher temperature for a shorter period, which can extend its shelf life by several weeks or even months.However, this process can impart a slightly cooked or caramelized flavor to the cream, which may not be desirable for all applications.Standard pasteurization, conversely, preserves a fresher, more delicate flavor but requires more careful storage and usage due to its shorter shelf life.

**Packaging and Size:** Bulk heavy cream is available in various packaging options, including cartons, bags-in-boxes, and larger containers.

The packaging and size of bulk heavy cream are important considerations for storage and handling. Smaller, individual cartons are convenient for smaller operations or infrequent use, while larger bags-in-boxes offer a more economical solution for high-volume applications. Consider the available storage space and the rate at which you'll be using the cream to determine the most appropriate packaging and size.

**Additives and Stabilizers:** Some brands add stabilizers to improve shelf life and prevent separation.

Some manufacturers add stabilizers such as carrageenan or guar gum to their heavy cream to improve its shelf life and prevent separation. While these additives are generally considered safe, they can affect the texture and performance of the cream, particularly in whipping applications.If you prefer a pure, unadulterated product, look for heavy cream with minimal additives or stabilizers.

**Organic Certification:** For consumers prioritizing environmental sustainability and animal welfare, organic heavy cream is a good option.

Organic heavy cream is produced from milk sourced from cows raised on certified organic farms. These farms adhere to strict standards regarding animal welfare, feed, and the use of pesticides and herbicides. Organic heavy cream may be more expensive than conventional options, but it offers the assurance of a more sustainable and ethical production process.

## Core Benefits

Bulk heavy cream offers several practical benefits for users needing larger quantities. Understanding these advantages helps in making the best purchasing decision.

**Cost Savings:** Buying in bulk typically offers a lower per-unit cost compared to purchasing smaller quantities. This can result in important savings over time, especially for businesses or individuals who use heavy cream frequently. For example, a restaurant baking desserts might find that buying a 5-gallon bag-in-box is much more economical than buying individual quarts.

**Reduced Packaging Waste:** Purchasing bulk heavy cream can definitely help reduce packaging waste. Instead of multiple smaller containers, a single larger container simplifies recycling. For example, using a bag-in-box reduces the amount of cardboard and plastic compared to buying numerous single quart cartons.

**Consistent Supply:** Buying in bulk ensures a consistent supply of heavy cream, minimizing the risk of running out during critical production periods. This is especially important for businesses that rely on heavy cream as a key ingredient. As an example, a coffee shop using heavy cream for lattes and cappuccinos can avoid supply disruptions by stocking up through bulk purchases.**Storage Efficiency:** While bulk purchases require more initial storage space, they can be more efficient over time by consolidating multiple small items into one larger unit. This reduces the need for frequent restocking and minimizes the number of containers cluttering up the refrigerator or freezer.

## FAQs Section

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about buying and using bulk heavy cream.

**What is the shelf life of bulk heavy cream?**
The shelf life of bulk heavy cream varies depending on the pasteurization method and storage conditions. ultra-pasteurized (UHT) heavy cream typically has a shelf life of several weeks or months when unopened and stored at refrigerated temperatures. Standard pasteurized heavy cream has a shorter shelf life, usually around two to three weeks. Always check the expiration date on the packaging and follow the manufacturer's storage recommendations.

**Can bulk heavy cream be frozen?**
Yes, heavy cream can be frozen, although it may undergo some texture changes. Freezing heavy cream can cause it to separate and become grainy upon thawing. However,it is still suitable for cooking and baking applications where the texture is less critical. To minimize separation, consider freezing the cream in small portions and thawing it gradually in the refrigerator. Whipping frozen and thawed heavy cream may not be as prosperous as whipping fresh cream.

**what are some common uses for bulk heavy cream?**
Bulk heavy cream is incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide range of culinary applications. It's a key ingredient in desserts such as whipped cream,ice cream,and panna cotta. It can also be used to enrich sauces, soups, and stews, adding a creamy texture and richness. Additionally, it's frequently enough used in coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.

I want to say thank you but I don't want it to be weird. What would be a nice way to express my gratitude?

I was thinking maybe a small bouquet from Plantshed, but I am not sure as I don't usually given business gifts (maybe it seems a bit romantic/weird to give my work friend flowers at the office?).

I also know she likes paper goods, starbucks, and reality TV, but I don't have specifics and I don't have a ton of time to go browse for something... I'd prefer to order and pickup or have it delivered.

I've gone between full time hours and part time hours due to school, and Lord I wasn't prepared for what I was getting myself into!! 
Bit of background, I work in a large location with over 100 workers combined, and normally 15?20ish people on FOH at any given time. We regularly pull in 200 cars an hour and this pace feels slow to us! I am also not a leader due to choice! I don't feel the need to suffer all of that for an extra dollar an hour. 

While looking back at my current career at CFA Im just wondering why has it been so terrible?
I'm just going to give some examples and I'll go into more stories in other post or comments if yall want. 
Let's start with my first few months! I 16 at the time was literally bullied by 3 shift leads. While I was still in training they would yell at me and laugh to themselves when I was confused with no help, ( mind you they would leave me on drinks and desserts alone with little to no training ) . The straw on the camels back broke when one more I spilt fresh hot coffee on myself and one of the girls didn't let me leave my station to run cold water under it. Instead during the breakfast rush she made me stay on desserts in till my screen was clear which was 30 mins later which left me with a large burn that lasted day. I had a meeting with my GM and a week later that girl decided to ""leave"" out of no where. Many think she was fired. 

But when it isn't the manger's causing issues it's the customers?! I understand that CFA is held to a higher standards due to our prices. But all because your meal is 9 dollars here and 6 at McD's does not mean you get to scream at me!! Literally every other shift I get yelled at by customers over small things like forgetting 1 extra sauce or the fries ""not being warm enough"". 

The pay is also veryyy low! I've been there for two years and I've only gotten a 1.50 raise... like shouldn't I be paid more?! ( I make less than 12 an hour) I work anywhere between 10-30 hours a week, and while working I'm normally praised as "" one of the fastest workers""

Anyhow! Does anyone else feel like their CFA is hell or just mine?? I feel like everyone praises CFA and I just needed a place to vent. If you wanna hear more stories like the time I threw an iPad and cussed someone out at work let me know or the craziest things I've seen in drive thru? Let me know!!

My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house.

The Naked Gun is a pleasant palette cleanser in a movie ecosystem that’s sadly shifted from ‘[insert genre] movies are a joke’ to ‘[insert genre] movies with some jokes’. This is a straightforward, no-frills comedy movie where its whole purpose was to get dumb laughs. It even clocks in at a lean 85 minutes, which is much welcome during a time where movie runtimes seem to be at least 120 minutes.

Liam Neeson plays Lieutenant Frank Drebin Jr., son of Frank Drebin (RIP Leslie Nielsen) from the original Naked Gun movies, a professional “Bad Guy Catcher” who works at the local ‘Police Squad’. Whereas Drebin Sr. is bumbling and out of his depth, Drebin Jr. is masculinity personified with an addiction to dirty chilli dogs and coffee (he’s always being handed a cup, whether he’s in the office or driving down a highway at speed).

Look, there is technically a plot but it’s not really important. For the sake of context, I’ll do my due diligence.

There’s been a murder and Drebin Jr. has to solve it. Along the way he encounters a femme-fatale type (a great Pamela Anderson), talks shop with his pal Captain Ed Hocken Jr. (Paul Walter Hauser, who is sadly a bit underutilised), and antagonises an evil billionaire (Danny Huston) with a blonde henchman (Kevin Durand). Oh and there a plenty of great cameos, which I won’t spoil here.

1mlo2gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/forquittingweed/comments/1mlo2gw/you_can_be_addicted_to_anything/,you can be addicted to anything,"an addiction is a typical pathway for your neurotransmitters (which is simply a moving neuron). your brain wants to create patterns and routines - its necessary. but sometimes it goes too far and it accounts for smoking weed every day or drinking coffee every morning or going for a run before work every day. all of these things, if done often enough, can technically become an addiction. your brain makes it a routine that it expects you to follow - its what you taught it to expect. so it expects it now.

changing any habit or addiction is difficult no matter what because your brain RELIES on that routine. changing it hurts the system but can be done if needed

other drugs are not just addictive but often have life threatening withdrawal symptoms. THIS is what made everyone say weed isnt addictive because your body will not fail to function if quitting cold turkey. it could if youre a real drinker, heavy drug addict, or very addicted to prescription medication (yes its true quitting pain meds can be life threatening) but you will NEVER die from quitting weed. You cant even overdose on traditional marijuana... BUT that doesnt mean your body isnt addicted. It just means the withdrawal symptoms are not life threatening

I have a Canadian university degree in Psychology and this issue came up a lot with weed - people saying its not addictive because the psychology world doesnt deem it to have a physical dependence. People didnt understand what the studies showed and misunderstood from the beginning. it was always addictive, and psychologists knew that the whole time but failed to manage society's view. its just that the addiction isnt severe like it is for hard substances where you literally depend on it, and can die without it. people got confused and thought it meant that since marijuana cannot achieve that status, it was safe and worry free. it only is to an extent, daily use can be a problem in other ways. it just wont kill you...

Just posting this here so if anyone is still confused by why people say that its not addictive, they might understand why that belief came to be in the first place. according to half my professors anyway (I'm serious, this came up A LOT)",1,1754741979.0,forquittingweed,0,1.0,False

Only a fool looks Alpha Zavier in the eye when he speaks. You dare not interrupt him and if you’re an omega girl called Aysel, it’s best to hide. I learnt these tricks early in life. I knew not to look up, not to make a sound and to make myself invisible in the crowd of people that filled the banquet hall to celebrate the Feast of the Moon.   
  
But I never did anything right. When asked to take a step to the left, I ended up at the right, whether I took a step to the left or not. Fate worked in reverse for me. If I sowed good, I reaped misfortune.   
  
It was the reason why, while serving with my head down, trying to make myself smaller than my small frame, I tripped on a fair leg, my tray of wine flying from my hand and tumbling to the ground, crashing – loudly – to the floor and spilling its red content against the fair feet of the Alpha’s daughter, in the middle of the Alpha’s speech. I raised my head and caught the Alpha Zavier’s gaze and at that moment, I’d broken three of the most fundamental rules of avoiding a beating.   
  
At that moment – when I made eye contact with the Alpha and sealed my fate –  Skylar, the Alpha’s daughter, let out a blood-curdling scream, as if it took her that ten seconds of silence to process what I’d done. I’d spilt expensive wine on her equally expensive, white, floor length dress.  
  
Her hand smacked my head to the right as an apology dropped from my lips. Then to the left, and right again. She kept smacking me as everyone stared with their mouths open at what I had done until the Alpha cleared his throat and called for order.   
  
“That’s enough, Sky.” Alpha Zavier looked at me as he addressed his daughter, his eyes filled with deep hatred and fiery anger. I gulped, cupping my hot cheeks.  
  
“It’s not. This little bitch ruined my dress!” Skylar cried, her sweet soprano voice raising as she hit me for the last time. “Why are you so jealous of me?” She cried yet again, dragging everyone’s attention back to the scene despite the Alpha’s call for order.  
  
“I’m not,” I answered in a whispery voice with my hands shaking.   
  
My eyes stung with the tears I held at bay, blurring the faces around me. I didn’t want to cry now – not now. It would only make my humiliation worse if I broke down here. I told myself I had to wait – I had to wait for them to take me out for a beating when the enforcers would give me a good reason to cry but I wasn’t strong. My lips quivered as the tears slid down my face. I blinked rapidly to clear them but they fell faster the more I blinked.   
  
Alpha Zavier signalled something at those behind me as his daughter stumped out, pushing people out of her way as she went. Two men grabbed me from behind, dragging me out of the hall. I looked at the few people who still watched the drama unfold as the Alpha went back to his speech, a muscle twitching at the side of his jaw. Only one person watching me looked at me with anything other than scorn in her eyes as the enforcers dragged me away.   
  
They threw me into a dark room, locking the door behind them. This dark room belonged to me. I slept here, had all my possessions – a single bag – in this room, the days I had food, I ate here and every day, I cried in this same room.   
  
Two months ago, I spent two weeks locked up in my room and sometime in the two weeks, my food supply was cut off. I’d starved for at least five days but down here, in the cold, damp basement of the pack house, time became relative. I could have starved for one week or to days, there was never a way to be sure. Everything was dark – every hour of the day, night.   
  
The door handle jiggled as someone tried to get in. The door jammed a lot and needed brute force to open on most days. Skylar came in with her brother and her boyfriend all wearing nasty smirks on their lips.  
  
My eyes lingered on Skylar’s boyfriend for a minute. A few years ago, Lucien had been my best friend. I told him everything. I loved him as a best friend and more.   
  
‘Promise me we’ll never fall apart.’ I held his hand and stared up at him the night before we started high school.   
  
‘You’ve started with your cute sentiments.’ He kissed my nose. I pretended to hate it but it warmed my heart. ‘It’s me and you for life, Ay-babe.’  
  
‘Me and you and Celeste,’ I mentioned my other best friend which made him laugh.   
  
‘Whatever you say, doll.’ The sound of his laughter made my knees weak.   
  
A few years later I found out we were mates so I tried to do something sweet for him, knowing what it’d cost me.  
  
‘Lucien –‘ I just wanted to see him smile.  
  
‘It’s Beta Lucien to you,’ he snapped, his hand around Skylar’s shoulder. The alpha female stared at me with indifference on her face but a spark of glee in her eyes.   
  
‘Beta Lucien, can we – can we talk?’ I watched as he twirled Skylar’s hair between his fingers.   
  
‘We can talk here.’ Someone behind them chuckled at his mocking tone. ‘What do you want? You’re wasting my time.’He stared at the gold watch on his wrist to emphasize his point.  
  
I stretched out flowers with shaky hands while the school watched with bathed breath. It was a secret he kept well but I’d been his best friend since we were in diapers and I knew he loved receiving flowers. He hid that part of himself because it wasn’t considered manly but he didn’t have to be manly with me.   
  
‘I love you.’ Loud guffaws surrounded me. Tears stung my eyes when my best friend and mate joined in the derisive laughter.    
  
“It’s time for you to pay.” Skylar smirked, pulling me back to the present. She’d taken off her ruined dress to come black combat shorts and a black long-sleeved keyhole shirt.   
  
“On your knees,” Alpha Bethel, the future leader of our pack called, dragging me out of my flat bed. I got on my knees without protest, facing my back to him. “Come hold her, Lucien.”  
  
“There’s no need to hold me,” I muttered. My head spun at the blow that landed on my head from behind when I dared to say anything.   
  
“Keep quiet!” Beta Lucien hissed. He not only humiliated me in front of the entire school that day, he also rejected me that same night.   
  
‘We can’t be mates. You’re ugly, poor and a stain on my reputation. I’d be a madman to mate with you.’ Those were the words he said to me before he rejected me.   
  
“I won’t – I won’t fight.” I took a step back when Lucien approached me. The worst part of taking a beating was being held down by Lucien. I’d learnt to take a beating without trying to run like the other omegas did because when Lucien was involved, it meant paramount pain. He was a choker and gasping for air with a belt lashing down wasn’t pretty.   
  
“Oh, really?” A strong hand gripped my jaw with bruising force, forcing me to look up at cold black eyes. Everyone in the Redville pack hated me but Lucien had a special place in his heart for hating me, a part of his mind dedicated to formulating many ways to torture me and make me wish I’d never been born all because I’d loved him.   
  
“Take off your clothes then.” I blinked. Tears spilt from my eyes when I blinked. I didn’t expect that but it made Bethel guffaw. He’d become especially cruel to me after we broke our mate bond.   
  
“W – what?” I swiped at my cheeks as the next alpha continued to laugh. I wouldn’t fight didn’t mean I wanted to humiliate myself in that way.   
  
“What the fuck is wrong with you, Lucien? Oh, so you want to see her naked?” Skylar boomed from behind us. I jerked away, Lucien’s hands falling from my face.  
  
“Baby –“ Her yelling cut off his soft, simpering tone.  
  
“Don’t baby me! Hold her, let’s get this over with!” Skylar’s jealousy saved me from humiliation but it made Lucien angry. He forced my head down by my neck, squeezing my neck with one hand while the other held my hands.  
  
Bethel’s belt came down hard against my back forcing a gasp from me. The gasp caught in my throat as Lucien squeezed harder. He wanted me to die and it seemed he wanted it today. The belt came back again with Lucien continuing to squeeze the life out of me. But the third strike, I could not keep silent anymore. Choked words spilt from my mouth, falling with tears and a bit of saliva.  
  
The belt came down faster and harder, Lucien squeezing my neck harder. My wolf whimpered, the physical pain getting to her as the men broke me.  
  
“Enough,” Skylar commanded. Bethel didn’t stop at once. He brought the belt down three times more after that command. I’d become a mess by then. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t thrash, couldn’t beg or fight. They overpowered me as they liked and ripped me apart the way they liked.   
  
Even after Lucien let go, I couldn’t raise myself from the table they bent me over. My body slid to the ground when my quivering legs couldn’t hold me up for much longer.   
  
My back bled with my throat raw and my eyes were swollen. I gasped for air now that I could take as much as I needed while Bethel put on his belt and Lucien wiped his hands on my sheets.   
  
“Next time, when you want to be unfortunate, make sure I’m nowhere near.” Skylar’s words came from a distance away, echoing faintly in my ringing ears. “You’re not only stupid, you’re also useless. Learn to stay in your lane.” She finished.   
  
“To think they tried taking over.” Bethel laughed his loud obnoxious laughter. I curled into myself, tears sliding into my ears from the position I lay in.   
  
“She has always wanted what I have. Nasty little thing.” Skylar clicked her tongue. “She deserves another beating just for bringing up bad memories.” I shut my eyes tight. I wouldn’t survive another beating. I wouldn’t.   
  
“She wouldn’t make it through another beating. Look at her,” Lucien sneered. “She doesn’t deserve an easy death.”   
  
I didn’t deserve any of this. Why did they make me pay for the sins of my people? I had done nothing to warrant this!   
  
This was for the disrespect I dealt Skylar. How would I cope with the Alpha’s wrath when it came? I interrupted his speech and dared look him in the eye.   
  
“Stay wretched.” Skylar crooned. She jabbed her boot into the side of my head in a hard kick that stole the light from my eyes.   
  
‘Maybe today is the day I die’ Were my last thoughts as my world went black.



**Chapter 2**



“Aysel.” I curled away from the person touching me.   
  
I didn’t want to open my eyes. I refused to awaken to a world that hated me. The only thing I wanted was to sleep the sleep of death to join my parents in the world after. I didn’t deserve any of the pain and suffering that awaited me in the world of the living.   
  
“Aysel, wake up.” My eyes fluttered open when the person shaking me refused to relent. “You have five minutes to eat before Monica comes barging in.” Celeste pushed a tray of food to me.   
  
“I’m not hungry.” I sat up in my dark room, wiping caked blood off my lips. “What time is it?” I didn’t know how long I’d succumbed to the darkness.   
  
“It’s morning.” Celeste brushed aside my question with haste, pushing the tray of food to me again. “The Feast of the Moon continues today. You have a lot of work waiting for you so you better eat now before you collapse doing your duties.”   
  
It’ll be unfortunate to faint while working today yet my stomach was a tight knot that wanted nothing in it.   
  
I staggered to my feet to change my clothes. The Feast of the Moon was a sacred and revered event held once a year. It would be folly to ruin it by showing up in a bloody dress whether I was an irrelevant omega or a powerful alpha.   
  
Celeste sucked in a sharp breath when I took off my clothes with my back to her. There was no need to look into a mirror; I knew what she saw and I didn’t have a mirror. I felt the sting of Bethel’s belt on my back as if it happened a few minutes ago.   
  
My teeth gnashed as I pulled on a clean black shirt, the stiff material of the cloth brushing against open injuries.   
  
“I’ll talk to him,” my best friend vowed. I turned to her with a sharp glare.  
  
“Don’t you dare.”   
  
Celeste didn’t understand what I went through in this pack. As the beta’s daughter, everyone loved and adored her. She had pretty strawberry blonde hair and large, expressive hazel eyes. She was a beta, like her parents. Her parents never tried usurping the alpha. The only blemish on her person was her friendship with me.  
  
She had an idealistic view of the world, believing that things could be better. She wanted to help me but every time she interferes, things got worse.   
  
“He can’t do this to you! You’re battered!” Her soft voice rose in a shriek.   
  
“He can and you won’t say anything about it.” She meant well but she had this disconnection from my reality that sometimes made it hard to converse with her.   
  
She didn’t know what a whip felt like. She didn’t know what being an orphan felt like. She would never understand what it meant to go to bed with a biting stomach and tearful eyes after a long day of rigorous work. I wouldn’t wish my worst enemy to experience the things I experienced but when she made it seem as if I didn’t try enough, as if I hadn’t tried too much, I wished she would leave me alone.  
  
Who would I tell what Skylar and her gang did to me? The Alpha lost his Luna because of my family. The Beta hated me. Who else could I turn to? Who would listen to my cries if I cried to them? My parents betrayed Redville pack and it was my fate to suffer the consequences of their actions.  
  
“Aysel, please.” She walked up to me and took my hands in hers, her big eyes filling. “Let me help you.” I pulled my hands from her, turning to face a wall,   
  
I needed all the help anyone could offer me but Celeste had tried enough. I couldn’t ask her to keep trying. If she confronted her brother about what he did to me, he would come back with Bethel and two belts.   
  
“Aysel.” Monica rapped on my door. “Get out here. No one keeps you around to sleep.” She yelled from outside.  
  
“I’m coming,” I yelled back, tying my hair.  
  
“Who are you yelling at?” Monica bellowed.   
  
“Celeste –“   
  
“I can’t handle Lucien but I can handle Monica.” She squared her shoulders before marching out of the cold and damp corner I slept in. She was a good friend. I didn’t know how I would have survived all these years without her. She was the only one to stick with me through the years after my pack wrote me off.   
  
I didn’t get to eat that day but I got to leave my room. I had only the Moon Goddess to thank for that. She made the Feast of the Moon, an annual celebration to give thanks and make merry amongst packs. For the next week, there would be a lot of food to cook, halls to mop and champagne to serve. Redville would need all the hands she could get so no one kept me locked up for long.   
  
The other omegas complained about all the work they had to do this period but not me. They had rooms with beds to sleep on. I had nothing of that comfort. My bed didn’t qualify as a bed anymore. My room didn’t have any lighting and darkness scared me. No matter how many clothes I piled on myself, I could never escape the cold of the damp room.   
  
Working took my mind off the many things that could be fixed in my life. When I worked, I put in all my effort, all my energy and strength so that when I finished, I went to the darkness of my room with pains all over my body and fell asleep in the blink of an eye.  
  
“I just want to grab a quick snack! Goddess, you’re clingy!” Skylar’s soprano called right outside the kitchen as I scrubbed the pans used this morning.   
  
My heart leapt to my throat, my hands freezing in the murky water I used in a scrubbing the pans. My mouth went dry and my eyes flew all over the place, jumping from the window near me and an open, empty cupboard beside me, looking for a way to get out or get lost.   
  
She couldn’t see me!  
  
Before I knew it, tears flowed down my cheeks with my hands shaking in the water.   
  
Her feet drew nearer and in a last minute of desperation, I darted into the open cupboard, pulling it close behind me.   
  
Breathing turned difficult. Sweat congregated atop of my brows as I hid inside the dark cupboard, flinching when her footsteps got into the kitchen. I didn’t dare breathe for fear of my breathing being loud enough to put me.   
  
I rubbed my hands at the back of my neck, my skin heating. Tight spaces terrified me. They made me dizzy, made my hands tingle and my legs lock. The small, dark cupboard closed in on me causing full body tremors.   
  
I clutched my knees to my cheek, closing my eyes and rocking back and forth in the little space the cupboard afforded me. My lips quivered, salty tears falling into my open mouth. I gasped but pressed a hand to my mouth when the movement in the kitchen seized for a second.   
  
My brain focused on her movements, forcing me to hold my breath to listen to her prance around the kitchen. At that time, she stopped before the cupboard I hid inside. I forced my knuckles into my mouth to stop a whimper of fear.  
  
“What is that awful smell?” She snickered. My eyes tightened, my body stopping the jerky, rocking rhythm. “Too good to answer?” She was talking to me but I couldn’t answer. I couldn’t bring myself to remove the hand I stuck into my mouth to keep silent – to hide from her.   
  
“Have fun in your new cell.” My hands wrenched out of my mouth in a split second.  
  
“Skylar, please –“. A gasp escaped my lips. Her response came as a derisive chuckle.   
  
“It’s cosy, isn’t it?” She laughed. Her footsteps grew faint as I pushed at the cupboard door bolted from outside.   
  
“Skylar! Skylar, please!” I pushed at the door, the world swimming around me, the darkness rushing to consume me. “Please don’t do this to me.” Small spaces terrified me. Oh goddess, please. “Skylar, please, don’t leave me! Don’t lock me in.” I screamed for her but even as I screamed, as the world closed in around me, I knew she already left me in the small cupboard space.   
  
I gasped many more times, my head swelling.   
  
“Skylar!”   
  
I positioned my shoulder against the wood of the cupboard door, banging against it with all the strength in my tired body while screaming her name until the door broke. I dove out of the cupboard, my chest heaving, only to see meet Alpha Zavier stirring a cup of coffee.



**Chapter 3**



“You can’t let them win,” I repeated my mantra in my head as two men held me down while a third lashes at me. The wounds on my back never healed. I didn’t go a week without being introduced to one or more new ways of torture. I’d developed a high tolerance to pain and to keep me down, Redville pack got more creative in their methods.   
  
“They won’t break your spirit.” If I proved deeper, I’d find my spirit in shambles – what was left of it – but my mantra kept me going. The Redville wolves used me as their lab rat – the victim that they tested out new methods of torture on.   
  
“I’ll be strong.” These words repeated in my head, a steady mantra that lived with me for the past eleven years.   
  
Eleven years ago, my parents betrayed the pack. I had friends and a good life until they ruined it. They wanted more. My father wanted Alpha Zavier’s position and he went for it. My mother never learnt not to support her mate so through it all, through the secrets, the going about behind the pack, the infiltration of the Alpha’s circle and the subsequent attack, she supported him. I’d been nothing but a nine-year-old whose parents turned traitors.  
  
They didn’t even get to rain down fire and brimstone as they planned. A close friend – a man my father promised would be his Beta at the end of the coup – chickened out at the last minute and went running to Alpha Zavier. He played double-agent for my father and Alpha Zavier but really, all his loyalty shifted to the Alpha. He didn’t believe my father could pull it off so thanks to him, the mission failed before its completion.  
  
My mantra couldn’t help me this time. The chants in my head, the desperation to hold on to something, to find a bit of inner strength so I didn’t break, failed me that day. It had become too much. This, heaped on everything else I endured since yesterday, went past the mental barrier I struggled to keep in place all these years.   
  
They’d broken me.   
  
It was my worst fear coming to bitch-slap me. I tried to keep a part of myself, hold on to a bit of strength so I didn’t come off as a loser like my father but it ran in my blood. I couldn’t succeed. Whatever I did had to be wrong. Everything I laid my hands on failed.   
  
It was the truth.  
  
A truth I ran from for eleven years. A truth I welcomed now. If it didn’t get better for eleven years, it wouldn’t get better now. I’d never lead a better life. I’d let them win. I couldn’t be strong and they’d won before I even joined the game.   
  
“That’s enough.” Alpha Zavier called. The sounds of whips coming down one at a time stopped. It became obvious then that they weren’t the sounds filling the room. No, those were my screams, my pleas and apologies because while I tried to be strong in my mind, I failed to be strong in reality.   
  
Who’s wouldn’t cry if they got beat up every day? Who would endure as I had? I’d exhausted my strength. I’d cry and beg and feel sorry for myself as I tried not to. When Skylar asked me to kiss her feet, I would fall on my face and slobber all over her feet. When Lucian asked me to take off my clothes, I would rend them in a minute.  
  
What good was resistance? What good had keeping my spirit brought me all this while?  They broke me. They won. I didn’t have it in me to care anymore.   
  
They left me in the cold cell room with me huddled into myself. The pain in my back warmed me. Blood trickled out of it to soak into my clothes, Tears didn’t stop streaming down my cheeks. My nose was blocked with snot that ran down my chin.  
  
I closed my eyes wishing everything would stop. I tried running away once and the torture I endured when they found me was not worth the initial excitement I had of freedom.  
  
Hell itself had to be better than this pack. The devil must be nicer than Alpha Zavier. He hated me. Oh goddess, how he hated me.   
  
I looked too much like my father for his sins not to reflect against me. I think when he looked at me, he saw the person who stole his world – killed his mate.   
  
‘I wish I hadn’t killed your father,’ he once said to me. ‘I should have kept him around to make him see what I’d do to you. To deal with him more than I could ever do to you.’ Hatred didn’t begin to describe what he felt for me. He loathed me, anchored me – he spat on the ground I walked on and hated the air I breathed.   
  
The sounds of approaching footsteps made me break out in cold sweat. When the key to the dungeon cell the Alpha kept me rattled, I closed my eyes, a chill going down my arm and spreading goosebumps.   
  
Back so soon?   
  
He’d kill me this time and I would welcome death with open arms at this point.   
  
“Goddess, it stinks in here.” I froze even more when I heard Lucien’s voice.‘I would welcome death with open arms but he would make death even more painful.  
  
Lucien, as hard as it may be to believe, had been my friend. As a child and even after the pack ostracized me. Everything changed a few years ago in an unfortunate turn of events that I wished never happened.   
  
“Keep your voice down. She may be sleeping.” When I heard Celeste’s voice after his, some of the knots in my stomach loosened. I didn’t dare move as the pain on my back and sides intensified with every small twitch of a muscle.   
  
“What did they do to her?” Was that pity I heard in Lucien’s voice?  It couldn’t be. This man made my life worse by simply being in the same room as me.   
  
Skylar would come for my head if she found out we were in the same room without her present. Half the curses I endured from this pack that didn’t come from the Alpha came from him or his gang.   
  
I hated him.   
  
More than I did the Alpha. He’d been my friend. I’d convinced myself that he loved me but his betrayal stung.  
  
“We’ll get you out, Aysel.” I flinched from Celeste‘s touch on my face. Everyone felt like my enemy in this state, even my best friend.   
  
“How do we get her up without aggravating her injury?” I heard her ask Lucien.   
  
How would he know? Why would he care?  
  
“I’ll carry her.” From my weakened state, from deep within a mind hazy and delirious from pain, I knew nothing good could come from him touching me. I didn’t want his hands on me. I didn’t want him near me. I didn’t even want him in the same cell as me!  
  
“You’ll have to be careful.” Celeste took a step back. All their movements registered from a faraway land, a land I didn’t inhabit with them.   
  
“What could she have done?” He whispered. He’d come too close to me. I felt him reach out a hand but halt when I started to shiver violently. I didn’t have the strength to run but I didn’t want him touching me.  
  
“The same thing she did to you. You held her down while Bethel belted her just yesterday.” Celeste didn’t sound impressed with the softness of his voice.   
  
“That’s - that’s different. It was only six strokes we gave her.” Six? It felt like something between twenty and a hundred. Six!?   
  
“Whether it’s six or sixty, you’ve been a part of this. You’re only helping her because I’m blackmailing you so don’t try sounding as if you’re a saint here!” Her sharp voice pierced my eardrum. “The lot of you are disgusting. You, your stupid girlfriend and your stupid best friend. I hate all of you!”   
  
“Leave Sky out of this. You don’t know what she’s suffered.” I didn’t want them fighting in my cell. I had enough on my plate without adding loud sibling spat that they would make my fault again.   
  
“Fuck you and fuck Sky. She’s using you but you’re too blind to see.”   
  
“She loves me.”   
  
“You’re just her shiny boyfriend. She doesn’t give a damn about you but that’s your business. I’m here for my friend. Let’s get her out before Alpha Zavier returns.” Celeste ran her hand through my hair again and I felt myself being pulled up. I gasped as pain bit into my skin from numerous open wounds.   
  
“I’m so sorry.” She kept whispering until they somehow got me on Lucien’s back. I still trembled, my tremors now accompanied by soft whimpers. I feared Lucien would drop me despite his hands clasped on my thighs so I tightened my hands around his neck. This could be another cruel joke of his.  
  
""We'll get you home.""



**Chapter 4**



I loved Lucien once. Along with Celeste, he’d been my best friend. His parents always quarrelled with him to stay away from me but he never listened to them. Things started to change when we entered high school six years ago. As we are older than Celeste by a year, it left the two of us as high school friends and Celeste still in middle school.   
  
It was around that time his infatuation with Skylar began. She’d been the hottest girl in our high school. I didn’t blame him for abandoning our friendship and choosing her. They made a golden couple – the Beta’s  son with his mop of curly black hair, lean muscular build, and long legs and the Alpha’s daughter with the perfect figure eight and shiny long hair.   
  
Lucien couldn’t be friends with me while dating Skylar who hated me from childhood. She abhorred me even before she had a reason to. I let him choose his girlfriend before me but he wouldn’t let me go. He gave me false hopes that ruined what little reputation I had amongst my peers.   
  
“Are you okay?” I could only nod at Celeste’s question while her brother cleaned my wounds. I assumed Skylar sucked out all the niceness in him through one of their many public kisses but he proved me wrong by coming to my aide and patching me up.   
  
“These will scar.” He sounded disturbed.   
  
Scars were nothing new to me. Scars decorated my back in their numbers, a map of whips, belts, canes, and everything else I’d been beaten with. The scars on my back were nothing; the scars on my mind were a telling of the pain that would never fade. I could cover my back and pretend I had nothing but smooth skin behind me but my mind lay bare to me, a constant agonizing torture.   
  
“It doesn’t matter.” I pulled away from his lingering touch.   
  
“Careful.” He stopped my sudden movement. “I don’t want the wounds reopening. You should stay still so Artemis heals you in time.” He threw out my wolf’s name as if we were friends, as if he knew her and liked her – my wolf, the omega that he couldn’t stand being associated with when he became the king of our high school, becoming even more popular than the future Alpha in the pack.   
  
He cleaned my wounds with the care of a friend, applied cream to my stinging back, and bandaged the wound then he got ice for the slight bump on my head from where Skylar kicked me yesterday.   
  
He may be feeling deserving of appreciation after all he did but I couldn’t find it in me to thank him. He started this. He held me down yesterday with brute force yet he wanted to act as my saviour today.   
  
“Why are you helping me?” I asked, turning to face him while ignoring the bite of pain from my movements.   
  
“Can you give us a minute?” He turned to his sister who stood with her hands folded, her upper back leaning against a wall with her legs crossed at the ankle.   
  
“I’d rather not be alone with him.” Turning to my best friend, I made sure she saw that I didn’t want to be left alone with my bully. I would have no interactions with Lucien if I had my way.  
  
“If you do anything funny, I will castrate you.” She wagged a finger at her brother, pushing off the wall.   
  
“Celeste –“ I didn’t have the strength to glare but I managed one.   
  
“Hear him out, Ay.” The traitor left me alone in a room with the bully.   
  
Celeste always wanted me to give people second chances. Even when it was obvious they only approached me to have a laugh, she wanted me to see the good in people and give them as many chances as necessary for them to show me a side that didn’t get me kicked or verbally abused.   
  
I’d given Lucien the most chances in life. He used to be my best friend but he chose Skylar, my arch-nemesis over me. He humiliated me in front of the entire school, set my diploma ablaze when I managed to graduate, and joined his friends in bullying me. He didn’t join in at first but after a while, he started to enjoy it. He had a wicked look in his eyes when he looked at me, and derived a sick pleasure from shoving me and pulling me down every time I found my balance.

1mlo02k,https://i.redd.it/fz26sf35kzhf1.jpeg,My details and timeline. Overstayed and work without authorization for some months,"👋 Hello I am an Indonesian, married a United States Citizen.
I came here on my tourist visa May 2023, met my husband, date for some months and we married in September 2023 . 
We met online, on a dating site. He was the first man I met, and I was the first one for him too.
Why short time ? Because we were met in time.
He was single for 7 years, and I was single for 6 years.

We prepared everything on November 2023 but the person who are supposed to file it didn't do that. 
And I was pregnant 🤰 so we didn't focus on that

📍My interview was in Bedford,  New Hampshire 📍
Our interview officer was a veteran.
She was so kind, so professional, she doesn't have an intimidating vibes. It was less than an hour. 
She approved us verbally.

She said to my husband "" If they don't change the rules, I would accept you guys without an interview ""

This is what she asked me first, and the officer asked my husband the same . 

She just matched our answers, I guess : 
- Me and my husband DOB 
- Parents in laws name 
- What is your address ? 
- How did you guys meet ? 
- Where did you get married ? 
- How many people ? 
I was married at church, so she asked 
- Who is your church pastor ? 
- When was the date , what day was it ? 
- Do you have child ?
- When is your baby DOB ? 
- Where do you guys go for a trip ? 
- Do you have a car ? 
- What type of car does your husband have ?
- Do you guys have pets ? 
- Who cook ?
- What is his favorite food ? 
- Do you guys have joint bank account ?
- How takes care of the bills ? 
- What is your husband job ? 
- What is his work schedule ?
- Do you work ? 
- What do you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ?
- Does your husband like tea or coffee? 
- How he drinks the coffe ? ( I answered the first thing he had to do is drink coffe in the morning , 2 to 4 cups of coffee) 
- What did you guys have for breakfast? 

She didn't ask any of any of additional evidences.

We brought our 10 months baby with us 👶, and the officer said the baby speaks everything.
Good luck 😊

As a former barista, I have experienced that out of the many alt milks I have worked with— soy milk steams the best. For some reason though, most coffee shops will only have oat and/or almond. I love going to Steady State for great coffee, but *sadly* they are one of the coffee shops that don’t have soy. Does anyone have any recs for great coffee shops in North County with soy milk as an option?  ",1,1754741580.0,northcounty,2,0.6,False

The car sat for a long time before deciding on doing the swap. I swapped the sensors around and still no Speedo. My worry if is the module went out but a friend said unlikely. The reason for this post tho is when I get to “150” on the Speedo (reality I’m doing 65) it Boggs out and I can’t give it power. At first I thought it was because the Speedo thinking it was maxed out but I went to go get coffee this morning and it out of nowhere let me go past the “150” or 65 mark and I was able to shift into 5th and no power loss. The next light it went back to bogging as soon as I got around 65. I also just replaced my injectors with an OEM rebuild. Not sure if those are the issue. Sorry for the essay lol but I wanted to make sure I give all info for the best diagnostic. ",2,1754741563.0,e39,1,1.0,False

I'm a 23-year-old girl around Chandigarh, and I'm looking to connect with like-minded people for genuine friendships. Life gets a bit quiet sometimes, and I’d love to meet people to talk, hang out with, grab coffee, or explore the city together.

A little about me: I enjoy long walks, binge-watching comfort shows, reading (especially fiction), and trying out new cafes or food spots. I’m open-minded, easy to talk to, and always up for a good laugh or deep conversation.

I’m mainly looking for other girls around my age, but open to anyone respectful and kind. No creepy DMs, please – just genuine, chill people who want to connect. :)

If you’re in or near Chandigarh and want to make a new friend, feel free to drop a message or comment!",0,1754741546.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,0.5,False
