What I’m Looking For
I believe in kindness and warmth above everything. I want a partner who is humble, easy to talk to, and genuinely enjoys the simple joys of life. Someone who becomes a friend first who laughs easily, listens with interest, and makes even an ordinary day feel special. Loyalty, empathy, and a great sense of humor matter to me far more than how you look or what you do.

Deal Breakers
•Arrogance or a judgmental attitude
•Controlling or disrespectful behavior
•Dishonesty or emotional immaturity
•Any form of addiction
•Poor communication or unwillingness to grow If kindness and emotional intelligence aren’t important to you, we probably won’t click.

Timeframe for marriage: 1 year to 2 year, with family involved after we get to know each other well.

If you see life as a journey of growth, laughter, and shared memories and you want a partner to experience it all with you might just be the person I’m looking for.",3,1754208522.0,IslamabadSocial,1,0.8,False

1mgdql4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mgdql4/last_night_i_m22_hooked_up_with_my_friend_m28/,Last night I (M22) hooked up with my friend (M28) after getting drunk and I don’t know how to feel about it. Could this be something more? Have I fucked everything up?,"Okay so. I’ve been thinking this over a lot and I don’t know what to do about it. Last night I had a messy fight with two of my roommates (M22 and M25) about something self-destructive I do related to a disorder I have. Anyways, it was bad enough I ran out of our house crying and I ended up at my friend’s place, who I’m calling Edward (M28) for clarity’s sake. Even though it was kind of late, he invited me in and let me rant, vent and cry about my roommates. Edward was super sympathetic about it since he deals with the same kind of disorder I do and it was really nice to have someone listen. Because it was a Thursday night and we both usually work weekends (and we’re men in our 20s), we decided to get drunk. Maybe not the best idea but I’ve never had great foresight when I’m sad.

So we’re both a little tipsy (me more than him since I’m pretty small) and Edward is still listening to my bitching and moaning. And I don’t know what it was about that but it made him look/seem really hot. I mean, Edward has been hot ever since we met like five or six years ago, this isn’t new. He’s six foot four, has visibly defined abs, an incredible face, beautiful tan skin and he’s strong enough that I’ve always felt safe with him around. For some reason, maybe because of the alcohol, Edward was completely irresistible in this moment and I kissed him. He seemed a little surprised at first but started kissing me back and it felt really nice, both physically and because it feels good to be wanted. Edward was so sweet about it too, he was cupping my cheek and touching my hair with so much affection that it made me feel crazy.

So one thing led to another and I put my hand down his pants and yeah. We had sex. A little clumsily and awkwardly because I’m pretty badly bruised and have a lot of joint and muscle pain right now. Edward was really gentle with me though and tried to be as careful as possible and kept kissing me and touching my hair. The actual sex part was fine but Edward was whispering sweet nothings to me, calling me gorgeous and telling me that he’s wanted to do this since forever. It just felt really nice to feel wanted and appreciated and for a second, I almost didn’t hate my body. Then we were done and Edward cleaned us up, held back my hair when I threw up and then helped me upstairs to his bedroom. I thought he was going to come to bed with me but he didn’t. Once Edward got me into bed and got me a mixing bowl in case I threw up again he left the room and slept on the couch.

So that’s kind of where I’m at right now. Edward made me coffee in the morning, let me use his shower and then drove me back to my place. And now I’m avoiding my roommates and obsessing over everything that went on with Edward. I can’t figure out what his feelings for me are or what to think about this whole situation. You might think I’m being stupid, that this is the most obvious situation ever but Edward does this kind of thing. He cheerfully calls himself “barsexual,” meaning he’ll make out with other guys after a few shots but has only ever dated women. He’s joked about hooking up with our boss/his friend (M28) and once he said he could do gay porn (I don’t even know). He also pretended to be upset when one of our other friends (M25) got a girlfriend. So I don’t know if Edward was just horny and going with it or if he wants something more.

Do you think we could actually have something real? Was this just a hookup?  Any advice would be appreciated, thank you

TL,DR: I, a man, had a drunk hookup with my straight male friend and now I’m confused about his feelings for me",1,1754208156.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
1mgdq0x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgdq0x,Made a Compose Desktop app to control and mirror Android devices,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m a mobile dev who relies on `adb` and `scrcpy` constantly — whether it’s for debugging, screen sharing, installing builds, or juggling multiple test devices.

got tired of the repetitive terminal commands, so I built a native desktop GUI using **Compose Multiplatform for Desktop** that wraps around `adb` and `scrcpy`.

**Introducing** [**Reflekto**](https://yarin.be/reflekto) — an open-source tool to manage and mirror Android devices with a clean Kotlin-based UI.

**Key Features:**

* One-click `scrcpy` per device
* Live system monitor (CPU, RAM, battery, thermal)
* View + manage installed apps
* Toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, rotation, etc.
* Auto-refresh & auto-select devices
* Dark mode & settings panel

**Tech Stack:** Compose Multiplatform

**Currently available for macOS\***

**Why I built it:**  
I wanted something modern and native that I could trust and extend, especially when working with multiple phones during testing. I also wanted to explore what Compose Desktop can really do.

Would love to hear what you think. Suggestions, bugs, feature ideas, questions, I’m all ears. Let’s build something devs actually enjoy using 💬

1mgdosx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mgdosx/uncommon_criminals_novel_by_ally_carter/,Uncommon Criminals Novel by Ally Carter:,"CHAPTER 1  
  
  Moscow can be a cold, hard place in winter. But the big old house on Tverskoy Boulevard had always seemed immune to these particular facts, the way that it had seemed immune to many things throughout the years.  
  
  When breadlines filled the streets during the reign of the czars, the big house had caviar. When the rest of Russia stood shaking in the Siberian winds, that house had fires and gaslight in every room. And when the Second World War was over and places like Leningrad and Berlin were nothing but rubble and crumbling walls, the residents of the big house on Tverskoy Boulevard only had to take up a hammer and drive a single nail—to hang a painting on the landing at the top of the stairs—to mark the end of a long war.  
  
  The canvas was small, perhaps only eight by ten inches. The brushstrokes were light but meticulous. And the subject, the countryside near Provence, was once a favorite of an artist named Cézanne.  
  
  No one in the house spoke of how the painting had come to be there. Not a single member of the staff ever asked the man of the house, a high-ranking Soviet official, to talk about the canvas or the war or whatever services he may have performed in battle or beyond to earn such a lavish prize. The house on Tverskoy Boulevard was not one for stories, everybody knew. And besides, the war was over. The Nazis had lost. And to the victors went the spoils.  
  
  Or, as the case may be, the paintings.  
  
  Eventually, the wallpaper faded, and soon few people actually remembered the man who had brought the painting home from the newly liberated East Germany. None of the neighbors dared to whisper the letters K-G-B. Of the old Socialists and new socialites who flooded through the open doors for parties, not one ever dared to mention the Russian mob.  
  
  And still the painting stayed hanging, the music kept playing, and the party itself seemed to last—echoing out onto the street, fading into the frigid air of the night.  
  
  The party on the first Friday of February was a fund-raiser—though for what cause or foundation, no one really knew. It didn’t matter. The same people were invited. The same chef was preparing the same food. The men stood smoking the same cigars and drinking the same vodka. And, of course, the same painting still hung at the top of the stairs, looking down on the partygoers below.  
  
  But one of the partygoers was not, actually, the same.  
  
  When she gave the man at the door a name from the list, her Russian bore a slight accent. When she handed her coat to a maid, no one seemed to notice that it was far too light for someone who had spent too long in Moscow’s winter. She was too short; her black hair framed a face that was in every way too young. The women watched her pass, eyeing the competition. The men hardly noticed her at all as she nibbled and sipped and waited until the hour grew late and the people became tipsy. When that time finally came, not one soul watched as the girl with the soft pale skin climbed the stairs and slipped the small painting from the nail that held it. She walked to the window.  
  
  And jumped.  
  
  And neither the house on Tverskoy Boulevard nor any of its occupants ever saw the girl or the painting again.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  No one visits Moscow in February just for fun.  
  
  Perhaps that is why the customs agent looked so curiously at the shorter-than-average teenage girl who stood in line behind the business people and expatriates who were arriving in New York that day, choosing to flee the Russian winter.  
  
  “How long was your visit?” the agent asked.  
  
  “Three days,” was the girl’s reply.  
  
  “Do you have anything to declare?” The customs agent lowered her head, studied the girl from over the top of her half-moon glasses. “Are you bringing anything home with you, sweetie?”  
  
  The girl seemed to consider this, then shook her head. “No.”  
  
  When the woman asked, “Are you traveling by yourself?” she sounded less like a government official doing her due diligence and more like a mother concerned that such a young girl could be traveling the world alone.  
  
  But the girl seemed perfectly at ease as she smiled and said, “Yes.”  
  
  “And were you traveling for business or for pleasure?” the woman asked, looking from the pale blue customs form to the girl’s bright blue eyes.  
  
  “Pleasure,” the young girl said. She reached for her passport. “I had to go to a party.”  
  
  Even though she’d just landed in New York, when Katarina Bishop walked through the airport that Saturday afternoon, her mind couldn’t help but drift to all the places she still had to go.  
  
  There was a Klimt in Cairo, a very nice Rembrandt rumored to be hidden in a cave in the Swiss Alps, and a statue by Bartolini last seen somewhere on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. Altogether, there were at least a half dozen jobs that could come next, and Kat’s thoughts wandered through them like a maze. And still the part that weighed heaviest on her was the jobs she didn’t know about—the plundered treasures no one had found yet. The Nazis had needed an army, she told herself, to steal them all. But she was just one girl—one thief. She felt exhausted, remembering it might take a lifetime to steal them all back.  
  
  When she stepped onto the long escalator and began her descent, Kat was completely unaware of the tall boy with the broad shoulders behind her until she felt the weight of her bag rise gently off her shoulder. She turned and looked up, but didn’t smile.  
  
  “You’d better not be trying to steal that,” she said.  
  
  The boy shrugged and reached for the small rolling suitcase at her feet. “I wouldn’t dare.”  
  
  “Because I’m an excellent yeller.”  
  
  “I don’t doubt it.”  
  
  “And fighter. My cousin gave me this nail file…the thing’s just like a switchblade.”  
  
  The boy nodded slowly. “I’ll keep that in mind.”  
  
  When they reached the bottom of the escalator, Kat stepped onto the smooth floor and realized how insane—and incredibly sloppy—it was for her not to have seen the boy that every other woman in the terminal was openly staring at. It wasn’t because he was handsome (though he was); it wasn’t  
because he was wealthy (though that too was undeniable); there was simply something about W. W. Hale the Fifth—a confidence that Kat knew could not be bought (and almost certainly could never be stolen).  
  
  So she let him carry her bags. She didn’t protest when he walked so close that her shoulder brushed against the arm of his heavy wool coat. And yet, beyond that, they did not touch. He didn’t even look at her as he said, “I would have sent the jet.”  
  
  “See”—she glanced up at him—“I’m trying to build up the miles.”  
  
  “Oh, well, when you put it that way…” A split second later, Kat saw her passport appear in Hale’s hands as if by magic. “So, how was Moscow, Ms.…McMurray.” He eyed her. “You don’t look like a Sue.”  
  
  “Moscow was cold,” Kat answered.  
  
  He flipped the page of the passport and examined the stamps. “And Rio?”  
  
  “Hot.”  
  
  “And—”  
  
  “I thought my dad and Uncle Eddie summoned you to Uruguay?” She stopped suddenly.  
  
  “Paraguay,” he corrected. “And it was more invitation than summons. I regretfully declined. Besides, I really wanted to do a Smash and Grab job in a mansion with half the former KGB.” He gave a long sigh. “Too bad I never got that invitation.”  
  
  Kat looked at him. “It was more like a Gab and Grab.”  
  
  “That’s too bad.” Hale smiled, but Kat felt very little warmth in the gesture. “You know, I’ve been told that I can really wear a tuxedo.”  
  
  Kat did know. She’d actually been there when her cousin Gabrielle had told him. But tuxedos, Kat knew, weren’t really the issue.  
  
  “It was an easy job, Hale.” Kat remembered the cold wind in her hair as she’d stood in the open window. She thought about the empty nail that had probably gone unnoticed until morning, and she had to laugh. “Totally easy. You would have been bored.”  
  
  “Yeah,” he said. “Because easy and boring are two words I frequently associate with the KGB.”  
  
  “I was fine, Hale.” She reached for him. “I’m serious. It was a one-person job. If I’d needed help I would have called, but—”  
  
  “I guess you just didn’t need the help.”  
  
  “The family is in Uruguay.”  
  
  “Paraguay,” he corrected.  
  
  “The family is in Paraguay,” Kat said louder, but then she felt herself go quiet. “I thought you were with the family.”  
  
  He stepped toward her, reached out, and slid the passport into her jacket pocket, just above her heart. “I’d hate to see you lose this.”  
  
  When he started outside, Kat watched the big glass doors slide open. She braced herself against the freezing wind, but Hale seemed immune to the cold as he turned and called behind him, “So—a Cézanne, huh?”  
  
  She held two fingers inches apart. “Just a little one.…Weatherby?” she guessed, but Hale merely laughed as a long black car pulled to the curb. “Wendell?” Kat guessed again, hurrying to catch up. She slid between the boy and the car, and standing there, with his face inches from hers, the truth about what the W ’s in his name stood for didn’t seem to matter at all. The reasons she’d been working all winter were blowing away with the breeze.  
  
  Hale’s here.  
  
  But then he inched closer—to her and to a line that couldn’t be uncrossed—and Kat felt her heart change rhythms.  
  
  “Excuse me,” a deep voice said. “Miss, excuse me.”  
  
  It took a moment for Kat to actually hear the words, to step back far enough to allow the man to reach for the door. He had gray hair, gray eyes, and a gray wool overcoat, and the effect, Kat thought, was that he was part butler, part driver, and part literal man of steel.  
  
  “You missed me, didn’t you, Marcus?” she asked as he took her bags and carried them to the open trunk with a graceful ease.  
  
  “Indeed,” he said in a thick British accent, the origin of which Kat had long ago stopped trying to pinpoint. Then, with a tip of his hat, he finished, “Welcome home, miss.”  
  
  “Yeah, Kat,” Hale said slowly. “Welcome home.”  
  
  The car, no doubt, was warm. The roads to Uncle Eddie’s brownstone or Hale’s country house were all free from snow and ice, and the two of them might have been settled someplace dry and safe within the hour.  
  
  But Marcus’s hand lingered on the door handle a second too long. Kat’s fifteen years as Uncle Eddie’s great-niece and Bobby Bishop’s daughter had left her senses a bit too sharp. And the wind was blowing in just the right direction, perfectly calibrated to carry the word on the air as a voice screamed, “Katarina!”  
  
  In all of Kat’s life, only three people routinely called her by her full first name. One had a voice that was deep and gruff, and he was currently giving orders in Paraguay. Or Uruguay. One had a voice that was soft and kind and he was in Warsaw, examining a long-lost Cézanne, preparing plans to take it home. But it was the last voice that Kat feared as she spun away from the car, because the last voice, let’s face it, belonged to the man who most likely wanted to kill her.  
  
  Kat stared down the long line of taxis picking up fares, travelers hugging and saying hello. She waited. She watched. But none of those three people came into view.  
  
  “Katarina?”  
  
  There was a woman walking toward her. She had white hair and kind eyes and wore a long tweed coat and a hand-knit scarf wrapped around her neck. The young man at her side kept his arm around the woman’s shoulders, and the two of them moved slowly—as if Kat were made out of smoke and she might float away on the breeze.  
  
  “Are you the Katarina Bishop?” the woman asked, eyes wide. “Are you the girl who robbed the Henley?”  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
  
  If a person wanted to be technical about it, Katarina Bishop did not rob the Henley—nor did any member of her crew. She was simply one of a group of teenagers who had walked into the most secure museum in the world a few months before and removed from its walls four paintings that were not the Henley’s property. The paintings appeared on no insurance statements. They were never listed in any catalogs. The Henley had never paid a dime for any of those works, so even as Kat herself carried one (a Rembrandt) out the museum’s doors, she was not breaking a single law. (A technicality verified by Uncle Marco—a member of the family who had once spent eighteen months impersonating a federal judge somewhere in Minnesota.) So it was with absolutely no hesitation that Kat looked at the woman and said, “I’m sorry. You’ve been misinformed.”  
  
  “You’re Katarina Bishop?” the woman’s companion asked, and although Kat had never met him before, it was a question and a tone she had heard a lot since last December.  
  
  The girl who’d planned the job at the Henley should have been taller, the question seemed to say. She should have been older, wiser, stronger, faster, and just in general more than the short girl who stood before them.  
  
  “The Katarina Bishop…” The man paused, searching for words, then whispered, “The thief ?”  
  
  That, as it turned out, was not an easy question to answer. After all, stealing—even for noble and worthy causes—was illegal. Furthermore, if their accents were to be believed, they were English strangers, and England was home to the Henley, the Henley’s trustees, and, perhaps most important, the Henley’s insurance company.  
  
  But the primary reason Kat couldn’t—or didn’t—answer was that she no longer considered herself a thief. Kat was more of a return artist, a repossession specialist. A highly uncommon criminal. After all, the statue she’d swiped in Rio rightfully belonged to a woman whose grandparents had died in Auschwitz. The painting from Moscow would soon be winging its way toward a ninety-year-old man in Tel Aviv.  
  
  So no, Katarina Bishop was not a thief, and that was why she said, “I’m afraid you have the wrong person,” and turned back to Hale and the long black limousine.  
  
  “We need your help.” The woman moved toward her.  
  
  “I’m sorry,” Kat said.  
  
  “We were led to believe that you were quite talented.”  
  
  “Talent is overrated,” was Kat’s reply.  
  
  
  She stepped closer to the car, but the woman reached for her arm. “We can pay!”  
  
  At this, Kat had to stop.  
  
  “I’m afraid you really have the wrong person.”  
  
  With one look from Kat, Hale reached for the limo door. Kat was halfway inside when the woman called, “He said you…help people.” Her voice cracked, and the young man tightened his grip around her shoulders.  
  
  “Grandmother, let’s go. We shouldn’t have believed him.”  
  
  “Who?” The word was sharper than she’d intended, but Kat couldn’t help herself. She climbed from the car. “Who told you my name? Someone said where you could find me, who was it?”  
  
  “A man…” the woman muttered, fumbling for words. “He was very convincing. He said—”  
  
  “What was his name?” Hale stepped closer to the young man, who had maybe eight years and two inches on him.  
  
  “He came to our flat…” the man started, but the woman’s whisper was all that Kat could hear.  
  
  “Romani.” She drew a deep breath. “He said his name was Visily Romani.”  
  
  CHAPTER 4  
  
  Perhaps you have never heard the name Visily Romani. Until two separate cards bearing that name appeared at the Henley four months before, very few people ever had. Kat had never heard those words until that time, but Kat was still a very young person in a very old world. Since then, Kat herself would say, she’d gotten much, much older.  
  
  At least that was how she felt an hour later as she sat beside Hale in a small quiet diner not far from Uncle Eddie’s brownstone on the Brooklyn side of the bridge. The old woman and her companion sat on the other side of the booth. Wordless and worn, both looking as if they’d traveled a long, long way to get there.  
  
  The place was nearly empty, and yet the young man kept looking over his shoulder at the waitress wiping down tables and the college girl who sat by the window wearing headphones and studying a book on constitutional law. He took the room in with sharp brown eyes behind horn-rimmed glasses.  
  
  When he asked, “Are you sure we shouldn’t go someplace more private?” he actually sounded afraid.

This is private enough,” Hale answered.  
  
  “But—” the guy started, but then Kat placed her elbows on the table.  
  
  “Who are you and why are you looking for me?”  
  
  “My name is Constance Miller, Miss Bishop,” the white-haired woman said. “Or, may I call you by your given name? I feel as if I know you—you and Mr. Hale.” She smiled at Hale. “Such a lovely young couple.” Kat shifted on her seat, but the old woman went on. “I’ve become something of a fan.” She sounded almost giddy, as if her whole life had been comprised of bake sales and Agatha Christie novels, and now she found herself inside the latter.  
  
  “I mean to say,” the woman went on, “that there’s something I would like for you to steal.”  
  
  “Grandmother, please.”  
  
  “Oh, Marshall,” the woman said, patting her grandson’s hands, “they’re professionals.”  
  
  Hale raised his eyebrows and smirked at Kat. Kat kicked him and gestured for the woman to go on.  
  
  “But, Grandmother, they’re…” He glanced across the table and dropped his voice. “Kids.”  
  
  “You’re twenty-five,” she told him.  
  
  “What does that have to do with anything?”  
  
  She shrugged. “To me, you’re all children.”  
  
  Kat didn’t want to like this woman. Affection makes people get sloppy, take risks. Do favors. So Kat didn’t allow herself to smile. She just focused on the single thing she really had to know.  
  
  “How did you meet Visily Romani?”  
  
  “He came to see me in London two weeks ago. He was familiar with our situation and said that you—”  
  
  “What did he look like?” Kat found herself leaning across the table, pushing closer to the only person she’d ever met who’d looked Romani in the eye. “What did he say? Did he give you anything or—”  
  
  “Have you ever been to Egypt, Katarina?” the old woman asked, but didn’t wait for a reply. “I was born there.” She smiled then. “Oh, it was a beautiful place to be a child. The cities were alive and the deserts were so big and vast—like the ocean, you see. We slept under big white nets and played in the sun. My father, he was a brilliant man. Strong and brave and gutsy,” the woman said with a shake of a fist. “He was an archaeologist—he and my mother—and in that day…well…in that day, Egypt was the only place to be.”  
  
  “That’s nice, ma’am, but I believe you said something about—” Hale started, but the woman kept on going.  
  
  “Some looked at the sand and the sun and said it was a barren, uncivilized land. But my father and mother, they knew that it is not the surface of a place that matters. Civilization is not made out of sand—it’s out of blood. My parents searched for years. Wars raged, and they searched. Children were born, and they searched. The past, it called to them.” Her gaze shifted into space. “As I guess now it calls to me.”  
  
  Kat nodded and thought of the treasures stolen more than a half century before, paintings she had never seen that she longed to touch and hold.  
  
  “Grandmother,” Marshall said softly, laying a hand on the woman’s shoulder, “perhaps we should get you some tea.”  
  
  “I don’t want tea! I want justice!” Her frail fist banged the table. “I want that man to lose his stone just like my parents lost everything they had!”  
  
  “Stone?” Hale said, sitting straighter. “What stone?”  
  
  But the guy didn’t even acknowledge the question. “Come, Grandmother, if the best lawyers in England can’t help us, what are two kids—”  
  
  “Kids who robbed the Henley,” Hale added. Kat kicked him under the table again.  
  
  “—supposed to do about it?” Marshall finished.  
  
  “My parents found it, Katarina.” Suddenly, the woman’s hands were reaching out to hold Kat’s thin fingers in her own. “They found it—a hundred kilometers from Alexandria, just a stone’s throw from the sea. They found it—one of the treasure chambers of the last pharaoh in Egypt.”  
  
  “The last pharaoh…” Kat started.  
  
  The woman sighed and whispered, “I suppose you might know her better as Cleopatra.”  
  
  When Kat’s fingers began to tingle, she didn’t know if it was the woman’s words or her grasp that numbed her.  
  
  “Oh, it was a glorious sight. Cleopatra had known her empire’s days were numbered, and she’d taken great care to hide her finest treasures from the Romans. The chamber was the largest my parents had ever seen. Urns and statues and gold…so much gold. I remember playing hide-and-seek with the diggers in mountains of gold so high, they might as well have been made of sand.”  
  
  She unclasped the purse that sat on her lap and drew a faded black-and-white photograph from the inner lining. Her hands seemed especially frail as she held it, staring down at a memory.  
  
  “That was the happiest I’d ever been,” the woman said, holding the photo out to Kat and Hale like an offering. Kat leaned across the cheap diner table and studied the image of a young girl in a white dress standing among the treasures of a queen.  
  
  “What happened?” Hale said again.  
  
  “Kelly…happened,” the grandson spoke, and the sound of that name was all it took to wipe the smile from the woman’s face.  
  
  “I never liked him, and you should always trust the instincts of children,” she said, then laughed softly. “But I suppose you already know that.”  
  
  Kat nodded and said, “Go on.”  
  
  “Well, my parents found the chamber, and three days into the documentation process, my mother went into premature labor with my brother. It was terrible. We almost lost both of them. But my parents had discovered the find of their careers, so they were happy. My father had a young assistant whom he left to oversee the work while my mother recovered. Two weeks, my parents were gone. Two weeks.” The last words she said no louder than a whisper. “Do you know how much your life can change in two weeks?”  
  
  Kat felt Hale’s leg pressing against hers under the table, but neither of them said a word. Neither of them had to.  
  
  “He took it all, Miss Bishop. In the two weeks my mother lay near death, my parents’ assistant took everything they’d worked for their entire lives.”  
  
  “He claimed the find?” Kat guessed.  
  
  “Worse,” the woman said. “He packed everything up and began to sell it. Not one piece was logged. Nothing was chronicled or examined. Artifacts were crammed into steamers and hauled across the Mediterranean. History was sold to the highest bidder at a time when the world paid very well for the treasures of the kings. Or queens, as the case may be.”  
  
  Then the woman reached for a handkerchief, but she didn’t start to cry. She just studied Kat and Hale and told them, “My parents were discredited and penniless—the laughingstock of the archaeological world. The find of their careers was gone—taken by the person they’d trusted most.”  
  
  “But surely they’d told people?” Hale didn’t even try to hide the skepticism in his voice. “Surely someone knew what they’d been working on and what they’d found.”  
  
  “Oh, but it was a wild place, Mr. Hale. Those were dangerous times. Looters were everywhere—grave robbers, treasure seekers. Real archaeologists were incredibly careful with their work. Secrecy was paramount.”  
  
  “But after…” Kat started.  
  
  The woman huffed. “After? After, they were broken and abandoned. After, they had nothing but their pride and their children. I, Miss Bishop…My brother and I were the only things they carried out of that sand, and soon I too will turn to dust.” She took a deep breath, and her delicate hands gripped the handkerchief tighter. “It is too late for my parents to have what was theirs. But it’s not too late for Egypt to have what is Egypt’s.”  
  
  She placed her palms on the table and leaned forward, a new urgency in her eyes. It was the look of a woman with a purpose—a plan.  
  
  “There is a museum in Cairo that will take the stone if I can deliver it to them. They should have had it a half century ago, but better late than never.” Then she stopped. She seemed to be studying Kat anew when she said, �  
��It must be a wonderful feeling to take something beautiful and return it to its rightful home. Wouldn’t you agree, Katarina?”  
  
  “What…” Kat shook her head. “What did Visily Romani tell you about me?”  
  
  “That you steal things.” Again, the woman gave a soft laugh. Kat tried to see something of the girl from the picture in her eyes, but too much time and sun and sand stood between them.  
  
  Hale sat up a little straighter. “Your parents’ assistant’s name was Kelly?”  
  
  The woman smiled. “Yes.”  
  
  “Oliver Kelly?” Hale asked.  
  
  The woman laughed again and searched Kat’s eyes. “Yes, Katarina, the founder of the world’s greatest auction house was a coward, a plunderer…a thief.”  
  
  Outside, a cold rain was falling. Kat could hear the drops landing against the diner’s windows, and she thought of Warsaw and the look in Abiram Stein’s eyes as he’d talked about war and Nazis and paintings.  
  
  “Look at that picture, Katarina.” The woman slid the snapshot farther across the table.  
  
  “It’s a lovely—”  
  
  “Look closer.”  
  
  Kelly. Egypt. Cleopatra. The words filled the room like the aroma of coffee and sound of the rain. Kat looked down once more and saw a little girl in a long white dress, an ornate room, two tanned hands, and the largest gem that Katarina Bishop had ever seen.  
  
  “Is that—”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “So this is—”  
  
  The grandson swallowed. “Yes.”  
  
  “And you want us to—”  
  
  “Your friend Mr. Romani assured us that you’re perfectly qualified. If it’s a matter of financing, I’m afraid our legal efforts have left us rather poorer than we once were, but we have some assets we could liquidate. This”—the woman gripped an antique locket that hung from a chain around her neck—“I know a dealer who would give me five hundred pounds for it.”  
  
  “It’s not money,” Kat said, shaking her head. “It’s just that…you want us to track down and steal the Cleopatra Emerald?”  
  
  “The Cleopatra Emerald?” Hale added for emphasis.  
  
  “Oh yeah.” For the first time, the grandson smiled. “The one that’s cursed.

1mgdn01,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgdn01,Made a Compose Desktop app to control and mirror Android devices,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m a mobile dev who relies on `adb` and `scrcpy` constantly — whether it’s for debugging, screen sharing, installing builds, or juggling multiple test devices.

got tired of the repetitive terminal commands, so I built a native desktop GUI using **Compose Multiplatform for Desktop** that wraps around `adb` and `scrcpy`.

**Introducing** [**Reflekto**](https://yarin.be/reflekto) — an open-source tool to manage and mirror Android devices with a clean Kotlin-based UI.

**Key Features:**

* One-click `scrcpy` per device
* Live system monitor (CPU, RAM, battery, thermal)
* View + manage installed apps
* Toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, rotation, etc.
* Auto-refresh & auto-select devices
* Dark mode & settings panel

**Tech Stack:** Compose Multiplatform

**Currently available for macOS\***

**Why I built it:**   
I wanted something modern and native that I could trust and extend, especially when working with multiple phones during testing. I also wanted to explore what Compose Desktop can really do.

Would love to hear what you think. Suggestions, bugs, feature ideas, questions, I’m all ears. Let’s build something devs actually enjoy using 💬

Thanks!

1mgdmzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mgdmzj/white_cat_novel_by_holly_black/,White Cat Novel by Holly Black:,"CHAPTER ONE  
  
  I WAKE UP BAREFOOT, standing on cold slate tiles. Looking dizzily down. I suck in a breath of icy air.  
  
  Above me are stars. Below me, the bronze statue of Colonel Wallingford makes me realize I’m seeing the quad from the peak of Smythe Hall, my dorm.  
  
  I have no memory of climbing the stairs up to the roof. I don’t even know how to get where I am, which is a problem since I’m going to have to get down, ideally in a way that doesn’t involve dying.  
  
  Teetering, I will myself to be as still as possible. Not to inhale too sharply. To grip the slate with my toes.  
  
  The night is quiet, the kind of hushed middle-of-the-night quiet that makes every shuffle or nervous panting breath echo. When the black outlines of trees overhead rustle, I jerk in surprise. My foot slides on something slick. Moss.  
  
  I try to steady myself, but my legs go out from under me.  
  
  I scrabble for something to hold on to as my bare chest slams down on the slate. My palm comes down hard on a sharp bit of copper flashing, but I hardly feel the pain. Kicking out, my foot finds a snow guard, and I press my toes against it, steadying myself. I laugh with relief, even though I am shaking so badly that climbing is out of the question.  
  
  Cold makes my fingers numb. The adrenaline rush makes my brain sing.  
  
  “Help,” I say softly, and feel crazy nervous laughter bubble up my throat. I bite the inside of my cheek to tamp it down.  
  
  I can’t ask for help. I can’t call anyone. If I do, then my carefully maintained pretense that I’m just a regular guy is going to fade forever. Sleepwalking is kid’s stuff, weird and embarrassing.  
  
  Looking across the roof in the dim light, I try to make out the pattern of snow guards, tiny triangular pieces of clear plastic that keep ice from falling in a sheet, tiny triangular pieces that were never meant to hold my weight. If I can get closer to a window, maybe I can climb down.  
  
  I edge my foot out, shifting as slowly as I can and worming toward the nearest snow guard. My stomach scrapes against the slate, some of the tiles chipped and uneven beneath me. I step onto the first guard, then down to another and across to one at the edge of the roof. There, panting, with the windows too far beneath me and with nowhere left to go, I decide I am not willing to die from embarrassment.  
  
  I suck in three deep breaths of cold air and yell.  
  
  “Hey! Hey! Help!” The night absorbs my voice. I hear the distant swell of engines along the highway, but nothing from the windows below me.  
  
  “HEY!” I scream it this time, guttural, as loudly as I can, loud enough that the words scrape my throat raw. “Help!”  
  
  A light flickers on in one of the rooms and I see the press of palms against a glass pane. A moment later the window slides open. “Hello?” someone calls sleepily from below. For a moment her voice reminds me of another girl. A dead girl.  
  
  I hang my head off the side and try to give my most chagrined smile. Like she shouldn’t freak out. “Up here,” I say. “On the roof. ”  
  
  “Oh, my God,” Justine Moore gasps.  
  
  Willow Davis comes to the window. “I’m getting the hall master. ”  
  
  I press my cheek against the cold tile and try to convince myself that everything’s okay, that it’s not a curse, that if I just hang on a little longer, things are going to be fine.  
  
  A crowd gathers below me, spilling out of the dorms.  
  
  “Jump,” some jerk shouts. “Do it!”  
  
  “Mr. Sharpe?” Dean Wharton calls. “Come down from there at once, Mr. Sharpe!” His silver hair sticks up like he’s been electrocuted, and his robe is inside out and badly tied. The whole school can see his tighty-whities.  
  
  I realize abruptly that I’m wearing only boxers. If he looks ridiculous, I look worse.  
  
  “Cassel!” Ms. Noyes yells. “Cassel, don’t jump! I know things have been hard . . . ” She stops there, like she isn’t quite sure what to say next. She’s probably trying to remember what’s so hard. I have good grades. Play well with others.  
  
  I look down again. Camera phones flash. Freshmen hang out of windows next door in Strong House, and juniors and seniors stand around on the grass in their pajamas and nightgowns, even though teachers are desperately trying to herd them back inside.  
  
  I give my best grin. “Cheese,” I say softly.  
  
  “Get down, Mr. Sharpe,” yells Dean Wharton. “I’m warning you!”  
  
  “I’m okay, Ms. Noyes,” I call. “I don’t know how I got up here. I think I was sleepwalking. ”  
  
  I’d dreamed of a white cat. It leaned over me, inhaling sharply, as if it was going to suck the breath from my lungs, but then it bit out my tongue instead. There was no pain, only a sense of overwhelming, suffocating panic. In the dream my tongue was a wriggling red thing, mouse-size and wet, that the cat carried in her mouth. I wanted it back. I sprang up out of the bed and grabbed for her, but she was too lean and too quick. I chased her. The next thing I knew, I was teetering on a slate roof.  
  
  A siren wails in the distance, drawing closer. My cheeks hurt from smiling.  
  
  Eventually a fireman climbs a ladder to get me down. They put a blanket around me, but by then my teeth are chattering so hard that I can’t answer any of their questions. It’s like the cat bit out my tongue after all.  
  
  The last time I was in the headmistress’s office, my grandfather was there with me to enroll me at the school. I remember watching him empty a crystal dish of peppermints into the pocket of his coat while Dean Wharton talked about what a fine young man I would be turned into. The crystal dish went into the opposite pocket.  
  
  Wrapped in a blanket, I sit in the same green leather chair and pick at the gauze covering my palm. A fine young man indeed.  
  
  “Sleepwalking?” Dean Wharton says. He’s dressed in a brown tweed suit, but his hair is still wild. He stands near a shelf of outdated encyclopedias and strokes a gloved finger over their crumbling leather spines.  
  
  I notice there’s a new cheap glass dish of mints on the desk. My head is pounding. I wish the mints were aspirin.  
  
  “I used to sleepwalk,” I say. “I haven’t done it in a long time. ”  
  
  Somnambulism isn’t all that uncommon in kids, boys especially. I looked it up online after waking in the driveway when I was thirteen, my lips blue with cold, unable to shake the eerie feeling that I’d just returned from somewhere I couldn’t quite recall.  
  
  Outside the leaded glass windows the rising sun limns the trees with gold. The headmistress, Ms. Northcutt, looks puffy and red-eyed. She’s drinking coffee out of a mug with the Wallingford logo on it and gripping it so tightly the leather of her gloves over her knuckles is pulled taut.  
  
  “I heard you’ve been having some problems with your girlfriend,” Headmistress Northcutt says.  
  
  “No,” I say. “Not at all. ” Audrey broke up with me after the winter holiday, exhausted by my moodiness. It’s impossible to have problems with a girlfriend who’s no longer mine.  
  
  The headmistress clears her throat. “Some students think you are running a betting pool. Are you in some kind of trouble? Owe someone money?”  
  
  I look down and try not to smile at the mention of my tiny criminal empire. It’s just a little forgery and some bookmaking. I’m not running a single con; I haven’t even taken up my brother Philip’s suggestion that we could be the school’s main supplier for underage booze. I’m pretty sure the headmistress doesn’t care about betting, but I’m glad she doesn’t know that the most popular odds are on which teachers are hooking up. Northcutt and Wharton are a long shot, but that doesn’t stop people laying cash on them. I shake my head.  
  
  “Have you experienced mood swings lately?” Dean Wharton asks.  
  
  “No,” I say.  
  
  “What about changes  
in appetite or sleep patterns?” He sounds like he’s reciting the words from a book.  
  
  “The problem is my sleep patterns,” I say.  
  
  “What do you mean?” asks Headmistress Northcutt, suddenly intent.  
  
  “Nothing! Just that I was sleepwalking, not trying to kill myself. And if I wanted to kill myself, I wouldn’t throw myself off a roof. And if I was going to throw myself off a roof, I would put on some pants before I did it. ”  
  
  The headmistress takes a sip from her cup. She’s relaxed her grip. “Our lawyer advised me that until a doctor can assure us that nothing like this will happen again, we can’t allow you to stay in the dorms. You’re too much of an insurance liability. ”  
  
  I thought that people would give me a lot of crap, but I never thought there would be any real consequences. I thought I was going to get a scolding. Maybe even a couple of demerits. I’m too stunned to say anything for a long moment. “But I didn’t do anything wrong. ”  
  
  Which is stupid, of course. Things don’t happen to people because they deserve them. Besides, I’ve done plenty wrong.  
  
  “Your brother Philip is coming to pick you up,” Dean Wharton says. He and the headmistress exchange looks, and Wharton’s hand goes unconsciously to his neck, where I see the colored cord and the outline of the amulet under his white shirt.  
  
  I get it. They’re wondering if I’ve been worked. Cursed. It’s not that big a secret that my grandfather was a death worker for the Zacharov family. He’s got the blackened stubs where his fingers used to be to prove it. And if they read the paper, they know about my mother. It’s not a big leap for Wharton and Northcutt to blame any and all strangeness concerning me on curse work.  
  
  “You can’t kick me out for sleepwalking,” I say, getting to my feet. “That can’t be legal. Some kind of discrimination against—” I stop speaking as cold dread settles in my stomach, because for a moment I wonder if I could have been cursed. I try to think back to whether someone brushed me with a hand, but I can’t recall anyone touching me who wasn’t clearly gloved.  
  
  “We haven’t come to any determination about your future here at Wallingford yet. ” The headmistress leafs through some of the papers on her desk. The dean pours himself a coffee.  
  
  “I can still be a day student. ” I don’t want to sleep in an empty house or crash with either of my brothers, but I will. I’ll do whatever lets me keep my life the way it is.  
  
  “Go to your dorm and pack some things. Consider yourself on medical leave. ”  
  
  “Just until I get a doctor’s note,” I say.  
  
  Neither of them replies, and after a few moments of standing awkwardly, I head for the door.  
  
  Don’t be too sympathetic. Here’s the essential truth about me: I killed a girl when I was fourteen. Her name was Lila, she was my best friend, and I loved her. I killed her anyway. There’s a lot of the murder that seems like a blur, but my brothers found me standing over her body with blood on my hands and a weird smile tugging at my mouth. What I remember most is the feeling I had looking down at Lila—the giddy glee of having gotten away with something.  
  
  No one knows I’m a murderer except my family. And me, of course.  
  
  I don’t want to be that person, so I spend most of my time at school faking and lying. It takes a lot of effort to pretend you’re something you’re not. I don’t think about what music I like; I think about what music I should like. When I had a girlfriend, I tried to convince her I was the guy she wanted me to be. When I’m in a crowd, I hang back until I can figure out how to make them laugh. Luckily, if there’s one thing I’m good at, it’s faking and lying.  
  
  I told you I’d done plenty wrong.  
  
  I pad, still barefoot, still wrapped in the scratchy fireman’s blanket, across the sunlit quad and up to my dorm room. Sam Yu, my roommate, is looping a skinny tie around the collar of a wrinkled dress shirt when I walk through the door. He looks up, startled.  
  
  “I’m fine,” I say wearily. “In case you were going to ask. ”  
  
  Sam’s a horror film enthusiast and hard-core science geek who has covered our dorm room with bug-eyed alien masks and gore-spattered posters. His parents want him to go to MIT and from there to some profitable pharmaceuticals gig. He wants to do special effects for movies. Despite the facts that he’s built like a bear and is obsessed with fake blood, he has so far failed to stand up to them to the degree that they don’t even know there’s a disagreement. I like to think we’re sort of friends.  
  
  We don’t hang out with many of the same people, which makes being sort of friends easier.  
  
  “I wasn’t doing . . . whatever you think I was doing,” I tell him. “I don’t want to die or anything. ”  
  
  Sam smiles and pulls on his Wallingford gloves. “I was just going to say that it’s a good thing you don’t sleep commando. ”  
  
  I snort and drop onto my cot. The frame squeaks in protest. On the pillow next to my head rests a new envelope, marked with a code telling me a freshman wants to put fifty dollars on Victoria Quaroni to win the talent show. The odds are astronomical, but the money reminds me that someone’s going to have to keep the books and pay out while I’m away.  
  
  Sam kicks the base of the footboard lightly. “You sure you’re okay?”  
  
  I nod. I know I should tell him that I’m going home, that he’s about to become one of those lucky guys with a single, but I don’t want to disturb my own fragile sense of normalcy. “Just tired. ”  
  
  Sam picks up his backpack. “See you in class, crazy-man. ”  
  
  I raise my bandaged hand in farewell, then stop myself. “Hey, wait a sec. ”  
  
  Hand on the doorknob, he turns.  
  
  “I was just thinking . . . if I’m gone. Do you think you could let people keep dropping off the money here?” It bothers me to ask, simultaneously putting me in his debt and making the whole kicked-out thing real, but I’m not ready to give up the one thing I’ve got going for me at Wallingford.  
He hesitates.  
  
  “Forget it,” I say. “Pretend I never—”  
  
  He interrupts me. “Do I get a percentage?”  
  
  “Twenty-five,” I say. “Twenty-five percent. But you’re going to have to do more than just collect the money for that. ”  
  
  He nods slowly. “Yeah, okay. ”  
  
  I grin. “You’re the most trustworthy guy I know. ”  
  
  “Flattery will get you everywhere,” Sam says. “Except, apparently, off a roof. ”  
  
  “Nice,” I say with a groan. I push myself off the bed and take a clean pair of itchy black uniform pants out of the dresser.  
  
  “So why would you be gone? They’re not kicking you out, right?”  
  
  Pulling on the pants, I turn my face away, but I can’t keep the unease out of my voice. “No. I don’t know. Let me set you up. ”  
  
  He nods. “Okay. What do I do?”  
  
  “I’ll give you my notebook on point spreads, tallies, everything, and you just fill in whatever bets you get. ” I stand, pulling my desk chair over to the closet and hopping up on the seat. “Here. ” My fingers close on the notebook I taped above the door. I rip it down. Another one from sophomore year is still up there, from when business got big enough I could no longer rely on my pretty-good-but-not-photographic memory.  
  
  Sam half-smiles. I can tell he’s amazed that he never noticed my hiding spot. “I think I can manage that. ”  
  
  The pages he’s flipping through are records of all the bets made since the beginning of our junior year at Wallingford, and the odds on each. Bets on whether the mouse loose in Stanton Hall will be killed by Kevin Brown with his mallet, or by Dr. Milton with his bacon-baited traps, or be caught by Chaiyawat Terweil with his lettuce-filled and totally humane trap. (The odds favor the mallet. ) On whether Amanda, Sharone, or Courtney would be cast as the female lead in Pippin and whether the lead would be taken down by her understudy. (Courtney got it; they’re still in rehearsals. ) On how many times a week “nut brownies with no nuts” will be served in the cafeteria.  
  
  Real bookies take a percentage, relying on a balanced book to guarantee a profit. Like, if someone puts down five bucks on a fight, they’re really putting down four fifty, and the other fifty cents is going to the bookie. The bookie doesn’t care who wins; he only cares that the odds work so he can use the money from the losers to pay the winners. I’m not a real bookie. Kids at Wallingford want to bet on silly stuff, stuff that might never come true. They have money to burn. So some of the time I calculate the odds the right way—the real bookie way—and some of the time I calculate the odds my way and just hope I get to pocket everything instead of paying out what I can’t afford. You could say that I’m gambling too. You’d be right.  
  
  “Remember,” I say, “cash only. No credit cards; no watches. ”  
  
  He rolls his eyes. “Are you seriously telling me someone thinks you have a credit card machine up in here?”  
  
  “No,” I say. “They want you to take their card and buy something that costs what they owe. Don’t do it; it looks like you stole their card, and believe me, that’s what they’ll tell their parents. ”  
  
  Sam hesitates. “Yeah,” he says finally.  
  
  “Okay,” I say. “There’s a new envelope on the desk. Don’t forget to mark down everything. ” I know I’m nagging, but I can’t tell him that I need the money I make. It’s not easy to go to a school like this without money. I’m the only seventeen-year-old at Wallingford without a car.  
  
  I motion to him to hand me the book.  
  
  Just as I’m taping it into place, someone raps loudly on the door, causing me to nearly topple over. Before I can say anything, it opens, and our hall master walks in. He looks at me like he’s half-expecting to find me threading a noose.  
  
  I hop down from the chair. “I was just—”  
  
  “Thanks for getting down my bag,” Sam says.  
  
  “Samuel Yu,” says Mr. Valerio. “I’m fairly sure that breakfast is over and classes have started. ”  
  
  “I bet you’re right,” Sam says, with a smirk in my direction.  
  
  I could con Sam if I wanted to. I’d do it just this way, asking for his help, offering him a little profit at the same time. Take him for a chunk of his parents’ cash. I could con Sam, but I won’t.  
  
  Really, I won’t.  
  
  As the door clicks shut behind Sam, Valerio turns to me. “Your brother can’t come until tomorrow morning, so you’re going to have to attend classes with the rest of the students. We’re still discussing where you’ll be spending the night. ”  
  
  “You can always tie me to the bedposts,” I say, but Valerio doesn’t find that very funny.  
  
  My mother explained the basics of the con around the same time she explained about curse work. For her the curse was how she got what she wanted and the con was how she got away with it. I can’t make people love or hate instantly, like she can, turn their bodies against them like Philip can, or take their luck away like my other brother, Barron, but you don’t need to be a worker to be a con artist.  
  
  For me the curse is a crutch, but the con is everything.  
  
  It was my mother who taught me that if you’re going to screw someone over—with magic and wit, or wit alone—you have to know the mark better than he knows himself.  
  
  The first thing you have to do is gain his confidence. Charm him. Just be sure he thinks he’s smarter than you are. Then you—or, ideally, your partner—suggest the score.  
  
  Let your mark get something right up front the first time. In the business that’s called the “convincer. ” When he knows he’s already got money in his pocket and can walk away, that’s when he relaxes his guard.  
  
  The second go is when you introduce bigger stakes. The big score. This is the part my mother never has to worry about. As an emotion worker, she can make anyone trust her. But she still needs to go through the steps, so that later, when they think back on it, they don’t figure out she worked them.  
  
  After that there’s only the blow-off and the getaway.  
  
  Being a con artist means thinking that you’re smarter than everyone else and that you’ve thought of everything. That you can get away with anything. That you can con anyone.  
  
  I wish I could say that I don’t think about the con when I deal with people, but the difference between me and my mother is that I don’t con myself.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  I ONLY HAVE ENOUGH time to pull on my uniform and run to French class; breakfast is long over. Wallingford television crackles to life as I dump my books onto my desk. Sadie Flores announces from the screen that during activities period the Latin club will be having a bake sale to support their building a small outdoor grotto, and that the rugby team will meet inside the gymnasium. I manage to stumble through my classes until I actually fall asleep during history. I wake abruptly with drool wetting the sleeve of my shirt and Mr. Lewis asking, “What year was the ban put into effect, Mr. Sharpe?”  
  
  “Nineteen twenty-nine,” I mumble. “Nine years after Prohibition started. Right before the stock market crashed. ”  
  
  “Very good,” he says unhappily. “And can you tell me why the ban hasn’t been repealed like prohibition?”  
  
  I wipe my mouth. My headache hasn’t gotten any better. “Uh, because the black market supplies people with curse work anyway?”  
  
  A couple of people laugh, but Mr. Lewis isn’t one of them. He points toward the board, where a jumble of chalk reasons are written. Something about economic initiatives and a trade agreement with the European Union. “Apparently you can do lots of things very skillfully while asleep, Mr. Sharpe, but attending my class does not seem to be one of them. ”  
  
  He gets the bigger laugh. I stay awake for the rest of the period, although several times I have to jab myself with a pen to do it.  
  
  I go back to my dorm and sleep through the period when I should be getting help from teachers in classes where I’m struggling, through track practice, and through the d  
ebate team meeting. Waking up halfway through dinner, I feel the rhythm of my normal life receding, and I have no idea how to get it back.  
  
  Wallingford Preparatory is a lot like how I pictured it when my brother Barron brought home the brochure. The lawns are less green and the buildings are smaller, but the library is impressive enough and everyone wears jackets to dinner. Kids come to Wallingford for two very different reasons. Either private school is their ticket to a fancy university, or they got kicked out of public school and are using their parents’ money to avoid the school for juvenile delinquents that’s their only other option.  
  
  Wallingford isn’t exactly Choate or Deerfield Academy, but it was willing to take me, even with my ties to the Zacharovs. Barron thought the school would give me structure. No messy house. No chaos. I’ve done well too. Here, my inability to do curse work is actually an advantage—the first time that it’s been good for anything. And yet I see in myself a disturbing tendency to seek out all the trouble this new life should be missing. Like running the betting pool when I need money. I can’t seem to stop working the angles.  
  
  The dining hall is wood-paneled with a high, arched ceiling that makes our noise echo. The walls are hung with paintings of important heads-of-school and, of course, Wallingford himself. Colonel Wallingford, the founder of Wallingford Preparatory, killed by curse work a year before the ban went into effect, sneers down at me from his gold frame.  
  
  My shoes clack on the worn marble tiles, and I frown as the voices around me merge into a single buzzing that rings in my ears. Walking through to the kitchen, my hands feel damp, sweat soaking the cotton of my gloves as I push open the door.  
  
  I look around automatically to see if Audrey’s here. She’s not, but I shouldn’t have looked. I’ve got to ignore her just enough that she doesn’t think I care, but not too much. Too much will give me away as well.  
  
  Especially today, when I’m so disoriented.  
  
  “You’re late,” one of the food service ladies says without looking up from wiping the counter. She looks past retirement age—at least as old as my grandfather—and a few of her permed curls have tumbled out the side of her plastic cap. “Dinner’s over. ”  
  
  “Yeah. ” And then I mumble, “Sorry. ”  
  
  “The food’s put away. ” She looks up at me. She holds up her plastic-covered hands. “It’s going to be cold. ”  
  
  “I like cold food. ” I give her my best sheepish half smile.  
  
  She shakes her head. “I like boys with a good appetite. All of you look so skinny, and in the magazines they talk about you starving yourselves like girls. ”  
  
  “Not me,” I say, and my stomach growls, which makes her laugh.  
  
  “Go outside and I’ll bring you a plate. Take a few cookies off the tray here too. ” Now that she’s decided I’m a poor child in need of feeding, she seems happy to fuss.  
  
  Unlike in most school cafeterias, the food at Wallingford is good. The cookies are dark with molasses and spicy with ginger. The spaghetti, when she brings it, is lukewarm, but I can taste chorizo in the red sauce. As I sop up some of it with bread, Daneca Wasserman comes over to the table.  
  
  “Can I sit down?” she asks.  
  
  I glance up at the clock. “Study hall’s going to start soon. ” Her tangle of brown curls looks unbrushed, pulled back with a sandalwood headband. I drop my gaze to the hemp bag at her hip, studded with buttons that read POWERED BY TOFU, DOWN ON PROP 2, and WORKER RIGHTS.  
  
  “You weren’t at debate club,” she says.  
  
  “Yeah. ” I feel bad about avoiding Daneca or giving her rude half answers, but I’ve been doing it since I started at Wallingford. Even though she’s one of Sam’s friends and living with him makes avoiding Daneca more difficult.  
  
  “My mother wants to talk with you. She says that what you did was a cry for help. ”  
  
  “It was,” I say. “That’s why I was yelling ‘Heeeelp!’ I don’t really go in for subtlety. ”  
  
  She makes an impatient noise. Daneca’s family are cofounders of HEX, the advocacy group that wants to make working legal again—basically so laws against more serious works can be better enforced. I’ve seen her mother on television, filmed sitting in the office of her brick house in Princeton, a blooming garden visible through the window behind her. Mrs. Wasserman talked about how, despite the laws, no one wanted to be without a luck worker at a wedding or a baptism, and that those kinds of works were beneficial. She talked about how it benefited crime families to prevent workers from finding ways to use their talents legally. She admitted to being a worker herself. It was an impressive speech. A dangerous speech.  
  
  “Mom deals with worker families all the time,” Daneca says. “The issues worker kids face. ”  
  
  “I know that, Daneca. Look, I didn’t want to join your junior HEX club last year, and I don’t want to mess with that kind of stuff now. I’m not a worker, and I don’t care if you are. Find someone else to recruit or save or whatever it is you are trying to do. And I don’t want to meet your mother. ”  
  
  She hesitates. “I’m not a worker. I’m not. Just because I want to—”  
  
  “Whatever. I said I don’t care. ”  
  
  “You don’t care that workers are being rounded up and shot in South Korea? And here in the U. S. they’re being forced into what’s basically indentured servitude for crime families? You don’t care about any of it?”  
  
  “No, I don’t care. ”  
  
  Across the hall Valerio is headed toward me. That’s enough to make Daneca decide she doesn’t want to risk a demerit for not being where she’s supposed to be. Hand on her bag, she walks off with a single glance back at me. The combination of disappointment and contempt in that last look hurts.

For homeowners seeking to enhance their interior decor with a statement piece,the arch coffee table offers a compelling combination of form and function.

The arch design provides more than just aesthetic appeal; it also offers practical benefits,such as increased legroom and a lighter,more open feel compared to customary,solid-base coffee tables. In 2025, this trend continues to evolve, with variations in materials, sizes, and finishes catering to diverse tastes and interior styles. This review delves into the best arch coffee tables of 2025, examining their key features, benefits, and potential drawbacks to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The best arch coffee tables of 2025 incorporate durable materials, thoughtful design, and a balance of functionality and aesthetics.

**Material quality:** The material used in construction greatly impacts the tableS durability, stability, and overall appearance. High-end arch coffee tables commonly utilize solid hardwoods like oak, walnut, or ash known for their strength and natural beauty. Cheaper options may employ engineered woods like MDF or plywood, frequently enough finished with veneers or laminates.Metal frames, particularly steel or wrought iron, add an industrial edge and provide robust support.

The choice of material significantly influences the table's longevity and resistance to wear and tear. Solid wood tables can withstand heavy use and are less prone to damage, making them a worthwhile investment for long-term use. Metal frames offer extraordinary stability and can support heavier items without risk of bending or collapsing. However, material choice also affects the price point, with solid wood tables generally costing more than those made from engineered woods.**Arch Design and stability:** The design of the arch itself is crucial for both aesthetics and structural integrity. A well-designed arch distributes weight evenly, preventing wobbling or instability. The curvature of the arch can vary from gentle and subtle to bold and dramatic, influencing the table's overall style. Some arch coffee tables feature a single, centered arch, while others incorporate multiple arches for added support and visual interest.

The arch's dimensions, including its height and width, affect the amount of legroom available underneath the table. A taller arch provides more clearance, making it easier for peopel to sit comfortably around the table. Similarly, a wider arch offers greater stability and reduces the risk of tipping. the choice of arch design should consider both aesthetic preferences and practical considerations to ensure a agreeable and functional piece of furniture.

**Tabletop Material and Finish:** The tabletop material complements the base and further defines the table’s aesthetic. Common options include glass, wood (matching or contrasting the base), stone (such as marble or granite), and even metal. Tempered glass tabletops offer a sleek, modern look and are resistant to scratches and breakage. wooden tabletops provide a warmer, more traditional feel and can be stained or painted to match any decor. Stone tabletops add a touch of luxury and are incredibly durable.

the finish applied to the tabletop protects the material and enhances its appearance. For wooden tabletops, options include lacquer, varnish, oil, and wax. Each finish offers a different level of protection and sheen.Glass tabletops might potentially be treated with anti-fingerprint coatings or have beveled edges for added safety. The choice of tabletop material and finish should consider both aesthetic preferences and practical considerations, such as durability and ease of maintenance.

**Size and Dimensions:** Arch coffee tables come in various shapes and sizes to suit different living spaces. Round, square, rectangular, and oval shapes are all available. The size of the table should be proportional to the size of the room and the surrounding furniture. A small apartment may only accommodate a small,round arch coffee table,while a larger living room can handle a larger,rectangular table.

The height of the coffee table is also an important consideration. Ideally, the coffee table should be approximately the same height as the seat cushions of the surrounding sofas and chairs, allowing for easy access to drinks and snacks. Measuring the dimensions of your living room and the height of your seating is essential before selecting an arch coffee table to ensure a comfortable and functional fit.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of an arch coffee table indicates how much weight it can safely support without risk of damage or collapse. This is especially important for tables used to hold heavy objects, such as books, decorative items, or serving platters. The weight capacity depends on the materials used in construction and the design of the arch.

Tables with solid wood or metal frames typically have higher weight capacities than those made from engineered woods. The arch design also plays a role,with wider,sturdier arches able to support more weight. It is crucial to consider the intended use of the coffee table and choose a model with sufficient weight capacity to avoid accidents or damage. Most manufacturers provide weight capacity data in the product specifications.

1mgdj6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cabbagepatchcashy/comments/1mgdj6b/doordash_chimp/,DoorDash Chimp,"One thing was for sure. I was a chimp.


 The day started out like any other. Woke up. Got coffee. Took Buster out for a walk with the kids. Made the wife a morning creme brulee. Took the kids to school and after that I even had my morning shit.

It was then and there, on the very same toilet that I decided to rip the penjamin with all my might. Once I successfully unclogged the vaping apparatus it was time to get on with the day. I had many things I needed to do, for one I needed to wipe my ass, but also other things beyond that, more important things than wiping my ass. 
Or so I thought.

 As it turns out I didn’t have anything more important. After all I was a 37 year old doordasher living in my wife’s basement, who was only allowed up to drop off the kids or eat the leftover scraps they left me near the door for cryin out loud! 
 
 After I wiped my ass, I went to wipe again because naturally one wouldn’t suffice. I gently tore off a sliver of the toilet paper with my toes, when I glanced out the bathroom window and saw a dash of black and brown fly by.

“What the fuck?! What was that?” 

“You stupid fucking idiot, what are you talking about, you literally saw nothing at all. You’re a schizo and you’re psychologically impaired and you’re doomed to a life of shame, you are a demon of babylon disguised as a fool and no one will mourn you and all will forsake you.” I said to myself as I pulled my Sonic thong up far too high.

 “Oooweeee!” Was the sound that bellowed from my mouth as I snatched back the waistband of the Sega product. 
I then had a strange thought: 
“I should go to the store.”
I then walked up the basement stairs, ripped off my muzzle, bashed my head through the door, and reached my hand through the oddly head shaped hole that had appeared. Using my keen wit and cunning stealth, I ripped off the door handle from the outside. It was then that I jiggled the door open, and was on my way to the zoo.

 “I wonder what the Zoo will be like Francine.” 

I had never been. 

  “It’s probably gonna be awful and you’re probably gonna have another episode where you turn into a chimpanzee and start killing everybody, you fucking prick why can’t you just stay chained up to the metal beam in the basement? A thousand curses upon you and your bloodline and a thousand more.” 

I gasped “Francine you bitch! How could you say that! I’ve known you for how long and you literally say that shit to my face, nuh uh I know we ain’t doin this right now like this is.. this is some bullshit man I don’t know what you tryna pull right now.” 

 By that point I had just walked past the unicorn exhibit and was checking the locations off the zoo map at a steady pace, when I looked over and saw something.. off…

 I don’t remember what I saw I think it was probably a trash can and I was like “Haha among us” or something but after that I blacked out and all they’ll say to me is that it wasn’t my fault. They just keep saying that to me, day after day, that it wasn’t my fault. 

 I think I’ve gotten pretty good at my banana peel sculptures, I made one of Adam Levine I think, not sure hard to see down here. 

 And the concrete is cold as hell and I already licked all the taste off the metal bars so I’ll just wait until a kid walks by and throws me some peanuts. Or maybe my keeper will let me get excited on his ankle this time! I sure do love being a chimp.

We had Thai food earlier—super spicy—and the nearest coffee shop was this Starbucks at 32nd Street and 7th Avenue in BGC, so we headed there for a post-meal caffeine fix.

While queueing, my stomach was not okay. Pretty sure it didn’t take the spice well. When it was finally our turn to order, Cham and Jay (the baristas) were taking our orders—and I just couldn’t hold it anymore.

So I let it out.

Cham immediately lost it, covered his nose, and looked over at Jay and the other baristas. My friend, who was placing the order, started wondering why everyone behind the counter was suddenly trying to hold back laughter.

Then one of the baristas—a girl—goes, “That wasn’t me.” And they all just started looking at each other, giggling uncontrollably.

Meanwhile, I was standing there trying not to laugh, thinking of how I could possibly tell this story later. I even brought out my Poy-Sian inhaler (those Thai menthol sticks) because I myself couldn’t handle what I just did.

They were still chuckling. Jay almost caught on because we made eye contact for a split second—him trying to keep it together, and me just inhaling like I was minding my own business.

I didn’t admit it to my friends either. They just assumed the baristas were laughing at something else.

We somehow made it through the order without breaking into laughter, but the whole staff kept sneaking glances at each other like they were trying to figure out who actually did it.

P.S. Anyone know how to order the Iced Barista drink in Venti without it being too sweet? Thanks 😂

**Can I place hot items directly on the concrete surface?**

While concrete is inherently heat-resistant, prolonged exposure to high temperatures can potentially damage the sealant or cause slight discoloration. It is indeed generally recommended to use coasters or trivets underneath hot mugs, plates, or dishes to protect the table's surface and maintain its pristine appearance over time.

**How do I prevent scratches on my black concrete coffee table?**

Although concrete is relatively resistant to scratches, it's still possible to mar the surface with abrasive objects or rough handling. To prevent scratches, avoid dragging heavy items across the table and consider using felt pads under decorative objects. Regular cleaning with a soft cloth will also help remove any abrasive dust or particles that could potentially scratch the surface.

**Are black concrete coffee tables suitable for outdoor use?**

Most black concrete coffee tables are designed for indoor use only due to their sealant and finishing materials. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, rain, and fluctuating temperatures can degrade the sealant and potentially damage the concrete. However, some manufacturers offer specially treated concrete coffee tables designed for outdoor use. Be sure to check the manufacturer's specifications before placing your table outdoors.

ELIAS REED'S FIRST CASE:


The morning sun filtered through the tall windows of the elite private school, St. Margaret’s, casting a golden glow over the marble columns and portraits of distinguished alumni. Detective Clara Mason strode confidently down the hallway, her heels tapping a steady rhythm on the polished floor. Trailing slightly behind her, Officer Jacobs struggled to keep up.

“Detective Mason, the body was found at 7:15 AM. The security guard was doing his usual rounds,” Jacobs reported, glancing at his notebook.

“The victim’s name?” Clara asked without turning her head.

“Professor Richard Mason. Taught literature. No relation to you,” he added quickly.

Clara gave him a sharp look.
“Thanks for clarifying, Jacobs.”

They stopped in front of a door labeled “PROF. R. MASON,” sealed off with police tape.

The professor’s office was impressively large — towering bookshelves lined the walls, packed with classic literature. Behind the massive desk sat a man in his fifties, head tilted back, eyes closed. An empty whiskey bottle and a note lay on the desk.

Dr. Arthur Pendleton, an elegant man with a light British accent, was examining the body.

“Detective Mason,” he said as Clara entered, “this looks like a classic suicide. Alcohol poisoning combined with medication.”

Forensic expert Laura Sinclair, dressed in a white lab coat, was collecting evidence near the desk.

“The note is in his handwriting,” she said, holding up the paper. “Says, ‘Forgive me. I can’t go on.’ And signed.”

“Motive?” Clara asked tersely.

Jacobs checked his notebook.
“The principal says the professor was depressed. Divorce, financial troubles…”

Just then, Elias Reed appeared in the doorway — tall, with tousled dark hair, a wrinkled blazer, and a steaming cup of coffee. A signature ironic smile played on his lips.

“Morning, everyone!” he greeted cheerfully. “Did someone call for a consultant with a questionable reputation?”

Clara frowned.
“You’re late, Reed.”

“Three minutes,” he said, checking his watch. “That’s practically on time for me.”

He set his coffee on the edge of the desk and began surveying the room, ignoring the disapproving looks.

“So, what do we have here?” he mused aloud. “A well-respected professor decides to end it all in his own office...” He paused, then shook his head. “No, something’s off.”

“What exactly?” Dr. Pendleton asked.

Elias pointed to one of the bookshelves.
“See that book? Pride and Prejudice by Austen. It’s upside down.”

“So?” Jacobs asked, confused.

“A literature professor would never shelve Austen incorrectly. That’s like… like you wearing your police badge backwards.”

Jacobs instinctively checked his badge.
“It’s straight!”

“Reed, not everyone is obsessed with order like you—” Clara began, but Elias cut her off.

“Now this is interesting,” he said, moving to the desk. “A Parker fountain pen. Expensive. But the note was written with a ballpoint.”

“Maybe the fountain pen ran out of ink?” Laura suggested.

Elias tested it.
“Full.” He sniffed the air thoughtfully. “And one more thing... Do you smell that?”

“Whiskey?” Clara asked.

“Not just that. A faint trace of women’s perfume. Chanel No. 5, if I’m not mistaken.”

Dr. Pendleton raised a brow.
“In a man’s office, that could mean—”

“A recent visitor,” Elias finished.

The team moved through the school hallway as Elias reviewed the professor’s background.

“Jacobs, what did the principal say about his personal life?”

“Divorced. Kept to himself. Quiet guy, but the students liked him.”

“Not very useful,” Clara muttered.

“This might be,” Elias said, stopping at the school bulletin board. “Look.”

A faded photo was pinned up: “Prom Night — 1998.” A young Professor Mason danced with a beautiful woman.

“Who’s that?” Laura asked.

“That’s me,” said a voice behind them.

They turned to see a well-dressed woman in her fifties — Ellen Crawford, the school’s principal.

“Richard was... a special person,” she said sadly. “We were close, a long time ago.”

“How close?” Elias asked with his usual grin.

She blushed slightly.
“That was before his marriage.”

“And recently?” Clara pressed.

After a pause, Ellen answered:
“We... occasionally talked. As colleagues.”

Elias exchanged a knowing glance with Clara.

Later, in the principal’s elegant office, Ellen sat behind her desk while the team gathered in front of her.

“Miss Crawford, when did you last see Professor Mason?” Clara asked.

“Last night. He stayed late after class.”

“Did you stay late with him?” Elias asked casually.

“We… discussed the curriculum,” she answered nervously.

“Until what time?”

“Around ten.”

“By the way, lovely perfume. Chanel No. 5?” Elias asked offhandedly.

Ellen looked surprised.
“How did you know?”

“Just a guess,” he smiled. “What did you two talk about?”

“He was upset. About money, alimony payments to his ex-wife… I tried to comfort him.”

“How exactly?” Clara asked.

Ellen flushed.
“We had a little wine. Talked about the past.”

“And then?” Elias pressed.

“I went home. This morning, I heard what happened…”

Outside the office, the team huddled in the hallway.

“You think she’s telling the truth?” Jacobs asked.

“Partially,” Elias replied. “But she’s definitely hiding something.”

“Maybe they were romantically involved?” Laura suggested.

“Doesn’t make her a killer,” Clara said.

“No, but it makes her a suspect,” Elias said thoughtfully. “Sinclair, what did the handwriting analysis show?”

“It’s his handwriting, but shaky. Possibly under influence.”

“Or under pressure,” Elias added.

Dr. Pendleton approached.
“Preliminary autopsy results are in. Cause of death: poisoning — mix of alcohol and antidepressants.”

“So suicide confirmed?” Clara asked.

“Not necessarily. That dose could’ve been administered covertly.”

Elias clapped his hands.
“Excellent! Then we have a murder.”

In the school cafeteria, Elias sat with a coffee as Clara joined him.

“Are you sure about this?”

“Let’s review,” Elias said, leaning back. “An orderly man — yet the book is out of place. Note written with the wrong pen. Perfume in the room. Nervous principal who stayed late.”

“But what’s the motive?”

“That’s what we need to find.”

A teenage girl approached their table shyly.

“Excuse me… are you the police?”

“Yes. Is something wrong?” Clara asked.

“It’s about Professor Mason. Yesterday, I saw him arguing with Miss Crawford.”

Elias leaned forward.
“What about?”

“Not sure. But I heard the words ‘money’ and ‘secret.’ She was really angry.”

Clara and Elias exchanged a glance.

In the school archives, Laura sorted documents while Elias flipped through old photos.

“Found it!” Laura said, holding up a folder. “Professor’s financial records. He was in trouble but…”

“But?” Elias prompted.

“Three months ago, he got a large deposit. Unknown source.”

“Interesting…” Elias showed her a photo. “Look at this.”

It was from 1999. A young Ellen Crawford, Professor Mason, and several others posed at a formal event.

“Just a staff photo,” Laura noted.

“What’s that?” Elias pointed to a corner.

There, partially visible, was a document with an official seal.

“Can you zoom in?”

Laura used a magnifier.
“Looks like… a marriage certificate?”

“There’s our answer,” Elias said triumphantly.

That evening, the team entered the principal’s office where Ellen sat sorting documents.

“Miss Crawford, we need to talk again,” Clara said.

“I thought we covered everything,” Ellen replied nervously.

“Not everything,” Elias sat down. “You didn’t mention your marriage to Professor Mason.”

Ellen’s face went pale.

“That… that has nothing to do with this.”

“1999. Secret wedding. Quick divorce. But legally…” Elias began.

“You were still married when he remarried,” Clara finished.

“We thought the paperwork was finalized…” Ellen sobbed.

“But recently, the professor discovered the truth. Realized his second marriage was invalid. That means the alimony…”

“He wanted me to come clean! He threatened to expose me! My career, the school’s reputation…” Ellen broke down.

“So you killed him?” Jacobs asked.

“I didn’t mean to! I only added sleeping pills to his whiskey — I just wanted him to calm down and forget. But he took his antidepressants too…”

“A deadly mix,” Dr. Pendleton confirmed.

“I panicked,” Ellen cried. “I forged the note to make it look like suicide. I never meant to kill him!”

“Ellen Crawford, you’re under arrest for the suspected murder of Professor Mason,” Clara stated.

That evening, the team exited the school as Ellen was led to a patrol car in handcuffs.

“How did you figure out the marriage?” Jacobs asked.

“Old photo,” Elias shrugged. “Too intimate for just colleagues. Plus her reaction.”

“And the perfume?” Laura added.

“Deduction. Expensive scent plus nervous behavior equals hidden intimacy.”

“Sometimes your methods actually work, Reed,” Clara said with a slight smile.

“Sometimes?” Elias smirked. “Detective Mason, you seriously underestimate me.”

My friend (Ellie for this story) is a super close friend of mine through an organization at our university. We recently had our main event (a camp counselor thing) and got incredibly close. I've been feeling little things here and there, like the eye contact in group settings and nicer hugs, and we've really opened up to each other outside of this group. 

For context: this counselor group is incredibly close and tight knit. There hasn't been any romantic things for several months, and lots of people are in relationships. This is kind of a new thing for this group of people were this to happen. It isn't uncommon for this to happen in this organization as a whole, however. 

Essentially, this definitely grew into what I can only perceive as some flirtiness and definitely a lot closer to me at a post-camp party the other day. The next day, I helped get her back home and it turned into running errands, meeting my cat and getting coffee and food. She asked to meet my cat, which everyone is telling me that is a clear sign of something. 

My idea was to either tell her on the phone call she wanted to have or text her about it prior to seeing her next. I don't know if it's jumping the gun but I'm confident in what I feel and how the friendship has seemed to shift. But then again, I don't wanna misread the room.

Then my anxiety was amped up because after my surgery, my surgeon went out of his way multiple times to emphasize how difficult my tonsils were to remove and how hard recovery would be. Full disclosure, someone has been home to help me and care for my toddler the whole time.

Days 1-2 were easy. Kept on pain meds, drank a lot of water.

Days 3-4 were a little rougher, but still okay on pain meds. 

Days 5-6 so far have been fine except for when the pain meds start to wear off and it’s suddenly a 9/10!!!!!! Wtf????? Those 9/10 times only last as long as 20 min usually (as long as it takes for ice and meds to kick in) but holy guac ouch. 

My scabs haven’t “fallen off” that I can see (wondering about the location of the 9/10 pain), but I read that if you stay super well hydrated they kinda just come off slowly instead of sloughing off? Can anyone confirm? 

Also my breath tastes and smells awful. SOS. Gum has been great for the jaw stiffness and making me swallow more often. 

Food: Salmon & tuna sashimi (cold & squishy), chia seed pudding (need to combat the opioid constipation, oof), dairy-free ice cream, dairy-ful clam chowder, all the popsicles, and some really overcooked pasta in bone broth with oil. 

Drinks: Lukewarm tea, lukewarm bone broth, cold protein drinks, cold water, very, very oat milky coffee.  

Meds: Tylenol, Oxycodone, Steroid, Antibiotic, stool softeners, occasional ibuprofen (not recommended in large amounts for me due to kidney issue, but my surgeon prescribes typically). Hella ice pack wraps. ",1,1754206784.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False
1mgddji,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mgddji/vyvanse_and_caffeine/,Vyvanse and Caffeine,"I will prefice this post by saying I am 17M, who recently graduated from high school and am about to begin University in the fall. I have been taking vyvanse (40mg) daily since September 2023, when I was originally diagnosed. At first, I stayed away from caffeine because my mum warned me to 'keep my heart healthy', but as a naturally curious person, I began drinking small energy drinks.

I must say, contrary to many of the other posts I have seen in this subreddit, mixing caffeine with vyvanse was heavenly- it spiked my energy levels (no kidding), boosted my productivity by ten-fold, and also made me super motivated. So.. yeah, it got to the point where throughout the last school year I was drinking a celsius or a red bull every morning-- just to function through my classes. 

This caffeine addiction was exacerbated by AP exam season this past April/May, where I was taking 80mg of vyvanse (two of my pills) as well as drinking roughly 200mg of caffeine every day. Since then, I have been taking 40mg again, but I still cannot seem to shake my caffeine reliance. 

I originally used the excuse that 'the summer would be for recovering from my addiction', but unfortunately, I can't seem to wean myself off of it. I feel so lethargic and useless without caffeine, and it almost seems like my meds don't work when they aren't mixed with a redbull celsius or coffee.

Yet, as the fall approaches sooner, I can't help but worry about how much worse my caffeine addiction will become during busy exam seasons in uni. Has anyone had a similar experience and if so, what is your advice? (other methods to boost energy levels, weaning off caffeine, etc.)

I’ve not hidden away and have been to weddings, stag dos, birthdays, parties etc. I just go for a much shorter time. 

One thing I haven’t figured out is how to spend a good amount of quality time with friends in a fun setting. I want to hang out with my old friends whom i’ve known for 20-30 years but have found it hard to replace the social set up of a night out or party. 

A night out or a day festival or pub trip or whatever means you spend 6-12 hours+ of constant time together. Of course it is not all quality time but it’s long enough to catch up, really get into it, and have a laugh. When I meet people for a coffee or walk or cinema it’s so much shorter. You barely get past the basic catch up. It’s quite hard for people to spend 12 hours in the day together due to other commitments. 

Interested to know if anyone has solved this. I don’t have something to let off steam, switch off, relax, laugh with friends. It’s exercise or brief meetings.

It was the summer of ‘06 and we had gone to Rick’s house by Claytor Lake. The old place wasn’t the flashiest, but it was nearby the water, and in the summer, a podunk lake-beach was enough to get a bunch of kids like us ready for anything.

I was still a junior and Rick was a senior, but his family had money, and his parents were out of town a lot. For what, I don’t know; in retrospect, maybe I didn’t know enough about Rick to begin with. But everyone at school knew it was old money—the kind of money that didn’t take kindly to flashy sports cars or gaudy jewelry. Maybe it was because Rick was still young or maybe it was because he didn’t like the stuffiness he’d been raised with, but he was very much the opposite.

He had this sweet-ass yellow Camero where the blower protruded out of the hood. I never knew much about cars, but you could hear that thing coming from a mile out. Generally, Rick wore oversized sports jerseys and cargo shorts. It was a rarity to see him with anything on his feet besides grungy flip flops. His personality defied his style. He enjoyed showy muscle cars and dressing down, but if you were to get him talking about something that he genuinely cared about, you’d have his attention for hours. Sometimes we’d sit out on his porch in Blacksburg till the sun came up, drinking Millers and talking about life. On those weekends, I’d crash on his couch, and he’d end up falling asleep in the recliner beside me; the TV would go on with infomercials till one of us drunkenly remembered to shut the thing off.

Among groups, Rick was a loudmouth and a braggart, but sometimes, when it was just me and him or sometimes with Jon, he’d become contemplative and inscrutable. It was a metamorphosis, but not an entirely negative one. We’d talk about where we were all headed in life, and Rick would go on about Hunter S. Thompson and about how the whole world was insane. He had a real hard-on for the author and sometimes waxed philosophical about the rigid expectations thrust upon him by his parents.

“It’s never as easy as it is in the movies,” Rick said, before cracking open the plastic on a glass bottle of Jack, “Never. You expect the whole world to open up for you and blossom like a flower. I expect—or I keep expecting that at some point all of this will begin to make sense. We’re growing up boys! Yes, that’s right, Jon, give me your glass and I’ll pour you one. You too Ren.”

At the call of my name, I offered my empty pail for refilling, and Rick obliged enthusiastically. Each of us sat on plastic chairs on the front porch of Rick’s house by Claytor Lake. Though all were dry, each of us was still in our swim trunks with towels draped around our shoulders.

Jon, a bit slower on the uptake, never could discern what Rick was talking about, and honestly, with age, I’m beginning to believe I never really understood either. Jon said, “What’s the point? Let’s drink. You’re bringing the mood down, Rick.”

Sometimes I’d waffle with Rick about what he meant and say things like, “What’s the meaning of life?” or “I think we make our own meaning.” This is where I came in with a point, “The world’s all meaningless, isn’t it?”

Rick rebuked this thread with, “No, Ren, I can’t believe in all that absurdist shit. It’s good for fun. It is! But I think it’s better to just accept that this universe is a madhouse and we’re all in it. It’s like one big game of marbles, right? They teach us that shit in school. Newton discovered the laws of physics. If you expand on that, then we’re all just apples fall from trees.”

“Wait,” said Jon, “I thought we were marbles.”

“Doesn’t matter,” said Rick, “Whether there’s an architect, we’re each predestined. It’s physics. Do I have control over myself? Nah. It’s all coming up.” He nodded drunkenly and took a drink. “It’s all coming up, for sure. I’m a little marble bouncing around in a can. Sure, it seems random, but if I could see how the cans shaking from the outside, I’d have some idea of where I was going next.”

Jon, having enough, cupped his hand to his head and said, “Let’s stop talking about this stuff, it’s late and like I said, you’re bringing the mood down.”

It was late. It was well past midnight. Pivoting round in the plastic chair, I peered out across the narrow front yard where the gravel driveway disappeared around a rightward bend into the trees; trees surrounded the house. Rick’s yellow Camero sat in dark shadows, so it looked like a great black lump in the yard. Moths flickered across the overhead porchlight. Crickets pumped a thousand volts through the trees.

Rick had driven us there for a celebration; it was summer, and he had graduated. He’d be going to Radford. Whenever asked about it, he’d say he wanted a good practical school—not some prestigious place his parents bought him into. It’s funny; he wanted to despair over his parents’ money, and only attend a college he earned, but I never ended up going to any college the following year. I never had the money for it. I don’t mean to say that I was actually jealous of Rick, but there were times when his complaining fell on deaf ears.

Me and Jon (who was also senior) had come out to Claytor and intended to stay the whole weekend, drinking and cheering our friend on. Jon had no plans for college; when prodded, he said he’d probably get his truck license like his dad. I don’t think he had any real plans, not really. But neither did I.

With some mumbles and talk about it getting cold outside, we shuffled into Rick’s house and took up in front of the TV on the couch in the dark living room. The living room sat to the right directly by the entryway. Rick went to the kitchen which was to the left and rummaged around while me and Jon blankly watched The Brak Show at low volume. It was the only thing playing that looked interesting to us.

When Rick rejoined us, he was licking the finishing touches on a fatly rolled joint. He ran his lighter along the paper’s seam upon finishing; this was something he always did but I don’t think it actually did anything. Rick lit the joint and plopped onto the couch beside Jon then passed it to Jon and I took it next then we began to dole out more drinks. This time it was more Miller. It was too early to kill ourselves completely on liquor. Idle conversation continued among us.

Jon finally asked among the jibes, “You guys hear about that girl that drowned in the lake last year?”

“Was it a girl?” I asked.

“I think it was.”

Rick took the joint from me and, still holding the thing out from himself, said, “I’m pretty sure it was a little kid, wasn’t it?”

Jon shrugged, “Fuck if I know.”

“Well, what’d you bring it up for?”

“I don’t know.”

Rick laughed, “You said I was the one bringing the mood down.”

“Hey,” said Jon, “You guys are going to come back sometimes, right?”

I wiped my mouth and slid from the couch to angle my elbows across the narrow coffee table in front of the TV and took stock of the several things strewn there on its surface: a box of playing cards, the TV remote, the keys to Rick’s Camero; I removed the playing cards from their cardboard box and began to shuffle them in my hands idly. “What are you talking about?” I asked.

“I mean—you guys are heading out. I know. Me and Ren will be alright without you for the next year, but I know Ren’s heading out. He’s too smart not to. But after that, it’ll just be me. So, I guess I just mean—we’ll still get together like this sometimes, won’t we?”

Rick seemed to sit a little stiffer, “Of course we will, man. Don’t get all weird. Hell, Radford’s not that far. I’ll be back on some weekends, and we’ll do something.”

Jon took his turn on the joint and held onto the smoke until his cheeks turned pink and his eyes began to water. The thin smoke became a fog in the room with us and cast everything in a strange haze by the light of the TV screen.

I took the joint out of Jon’s shaking hands, “Yeah, of course we will.”

Rick nodded and sat stiffer still, until it almost seemed there was an iron rod in his back. “Could I?” he started, “Could I tell you guys something I’ve never told anyone? Well—I never told anyone but my parents.”

Jon let go of the smoke in his lungs and spat words through a coughing fit, “It’s not about more of that deep and meaningful bull, is it?” His words were harsh, but his tone was jovial.

“Nah,” Rick shook his head and when he was next offered the joint, he stabbed it dead into the ashtray which sat on the coffee table. The thicker smoke continued for a while, hovering stringlike. I sipped from my beer while I waited for Rick to continue. Jon got his coughing fit under control and also awaited elaboration. Finally, after rocking back and forth a bit, Rick said, “It’s not a good secret.”

Rick’s face took on a waxen quality; his face shone madly by the glow of the TV. In the relative darkness of the living room, his jaw seemed to elongate and physically protrude from his face. I blinked and assured myself mentally that it was only the odd angle of the light. And the fact that I was rather inebriated. But something didn’t sit right with me. His eyes too seemed to change from their familiar roundness until they became great big almonds on the sides of his head. It looked like his head might explode.

“Hey,” said Jon, leaning forward to better examine Rick’s face, “Are you feeling alright? Maybe I’m not feeling alright.” He nodded at the joint in the ashtray, “Was that laced with something? Jesus!” He rubbed his neck.

“No,” said Rick. His voice came gutturally and unnatural from the back of his throat. “It’s a full moon tonight. I’ve been feeling it all this while. I knew it was coming.”

Suddenly Rick stood from where he sat by Jon and his swim trunks leapt from his body with a loud rip and they fell to the floor in a pile of strands. His towel soon followed, rolling off those massive shoulders. He grew. The kid I’d known for years towered over me and Jon by a measure of several feet. He’d always kept himself fit, but never like this. I too began to wonder if Rick had laced the weed with something different. I blinked again, but Rick remained the same hulking creature. What had once been my friend was now something completely alien. Hair sprung from his pores and covered his body in thick fur. Bones snapped into place as his snout came fully into view. His round eyes no longer contained any placid trace of humanity. They were the yellow eyes of a wild predator. The low hum of a growl resided somewhere in that great fur-covered chest as the transformation came to completion.

Jon flubbed a few inconsequential words from his mouth before Rick—or what had once been Rick—reached over with a massive left paw and sheared Jon’s head clean from its shoulders. Blood sprayed across my face, and I flinched. It’s probably what saved my life in the end.

I slapped my hand across the coffee table’s surface, snatching the keys to the Camero, just as Jon’s headless corpse toppled onto its own head, into the floor beside me, and I launched myself from sitting over the back of the couch, but Rick caught my right ankle on the way over and pulled be partially back. I kicked my free leg, hoping to land a blow on the chest of the beast, but failed miserably. The towel which had rested around my own neck flopped over my head, so I was blind. I swung my fists wildly, trying to pull myself forward over the couch.

Feeling a hot exhaust of air come up my lower back, I tensed and then came a sudden rush of pain. It ran the length of my body and sent a shiver to my brain then back down to my feet before it came to rest directly on my right buttock. Slapping the towel away, I turned to see Rick’s wolfish snout buried into my rightward flank. Pitifully, I moaned, “Not my ass.”

Then the creature tore away a great hunk of my flesh and I spilled the rest of the way over the couch, landing on my own face.

Adrenaline shot me to life, and I scrambled for the door, putting my weight primarily on my left knee as I slid across the floor. As I brought myself to stand at the front door, I felt something almost like a charlie horse forcing my right leg to bend up towards my abdomen. I had no idea the extent of the damage but did not intend on remaining by the entryway to examine it. I bolted through the doorway, sliding down the steps of the porch into the blackness of the yard; the crickets met me out there again, a million voices in unison.

I went hopping, half-stepping to the Camero, feeling blood begin to drip from my right foot. Coming to the car, I took a brief moment to glance back at the house. There stood Rick, lumbering out of the doorway. He was a great big werewolf, humanoid yet monstrous, there’s nothing else to call it, not really.

Spilling into the car, I peeled out of the driveway and hit the main road. I shot through one of the routes intended for the Claytor Lake State Park and just kept on going. The headlights illuminated a spiraling dark road ahead. Everything was spiraling.

The Camero roared and I brought it to sixty miles an hour around a sharp bend and that’s when I slowed. I began to feel the blood puddle around the leather seat I was sitting in. I would need to stop and plug my wound or wrap or something.

I brought the car to a slower pace and began to search the shoulders for speed limit signs to adjust my speed by. Would it have been better if I’d been pulled over by a cop? How would I describe my circumstances? I stole my friend’s car. But my friend is a werewolf, and he bit me. Also, he killed Jon. I promise I’m not crazy. I’ll take you to see him. No. I could’ve done that. But I didn’t want to return to Rick. I didn’t want to ever see him again. Or whatever it was he’d become. I couldn’t. Besides, I’d not yet fully realized the situation. The idea of a werewolf had not even come to mind yet. What I’d seen was a monster, yes, but a werewolf was like the movies. Besides, I was losing blood, and I was tired from the adrenaline spike.

Pulling into a Citgo station with only a single car, I left the engine running while I parked and yanked open the glove compartment; old fast-food napkins spilled from there into the floorboard and I reached for them and began to shovel them into the back of what remained of my tattered swim trunks.

My dad rushed out to the Citgo after I called him on the exterior pay phone. Over the phone, he was initially angry, then worried, then said, “I’ll be right there Ren.”

I waited in the parking lot, counting the seconds while sitting in the driver seat of the Camero.

When my dad finally arrived, he rushed me into his own car, an old beat-up Buick, and took me to the hospital in Pulaski. I must’ve looked faint, and all torn up, because he didn’t ask me very many questions on the ride there. He just kept tapping me on the shoulder and waving his hand in front of my face. Every few seconds he’d say, “Stay awake!”

Upon receiving treatment from the assbite of ’06, my parents finally asked their questions. I told them I’d been attacked by some wild animal, and I feel like that wasn’t totally untrue. Whatever Rick was certainly wasn’t human.

After packing my right buttock with gauze, the doctors injected me with a rabies shot. At that point, the idea of werewolves had come clearly into my mind, and I began to wonder if that little shot would do anything for lycanthropy. Thankfully, this was something I never had to consider further. I remember those first few full moons, I was waiting for a change, but nothing came. It did not seem that whatever it was that Rick had could be passed on via bite. I was in the clear. Unless the gestation period takes longer.

But it’s been years at this point, and I doubt I’m going to suddenly wake up one day as a half-man half-wolf hybrid.

Rick and Jon both ‘disappeared’, naturally. I never heard from Rick again, and Jon was dead. My dad mentioned to me that he’d read in the Roanoke Times that they found Rick’s car at the Citgo he’d met me at. I kept expecting the cops to beat our door down, but they never did. Whether it had something to do with Rick’s rich parents, I couldn’t say. Assuming they did seems right.

They had my blood in the driver’s seat. If they’d investigated the house, surely there was blood everywhere from Jon’s death. But who knows?

I’ve only been out near Claytor twice since that night, and on both occasions, I went during a full moon. I drove along the backroads, snaking around the park, and passed Rick’s old house; I never had the guts to pull up to the place. What would I find? Would I pull into that yard and see Rick standing there in the threshold, ready to pounce? I don’t know.

On each of my drives, I rolled the windows down, just a crack, to let the cool air wash through me. And each time, I heard wolf howls in the [dark distance.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Edwardthecrazyman/comments/17qis3x/archive/)",0,1754206524.0,nosleep,0,0.5,False

Yet it has been forced on me. As such, I am here now. I do not wish it were the case but I wake up, look at the sun. I am here now. 

It was twenty past eight when I went to work. I came to recognise myself as I often would as one hand passed  another coffee, the newest news on shark attacks, a sharp thirty gauge quarter inch. Still, sure as Hell, I shake a Portuguese man's clammy hand and find myself quite fired. But then all at once, I can recall it unsurprising. It may have been the first blessing, to have forgotten at all.

""Well, shit! I am here now."" I spoke outwards to nobody at all. I felt for those not feeling it. Well. “Well. When is now a good time?""

It was all very stupid. Desperation in the arms of what keeps one among their own. Fear of the scratch a man makes towards the back of another's skull.

""How could they fathom?"" 
It was little more than a mumble from a few inches behind. My brow knit for a second and I let out a rheumy cough that caught the ear of two or so passerbys down in the street. This was so intrusively funny given the state of us there, I laughed. We both laughed. The women in the street hurried along. 

Knowing that something is unlike you, seen in the swing of the revolving door there. A person can find such great frustration in it. Endless whys and no one way to ask. One can see plain, and still it reads so shallow. Normalcy left to strike deepest when you are simply too dumb to know it any less than strange. Pervasive. And perpetually most familiar in pairs of three. 

We had resolve to record future findings. I was waiting on three blessings. He told me I was looking for two, but he was wrong. So we sat pinned against one another on the steps, smoking.

It would practically float, so smooth, so efficient—Yet the door is just one door, out of tens on each floor. And the glide itself was more than enough traffic to the senses. A flash of light off the glass in the shape of the contemporary era. What a scene it was. We could consider the glare  another way in, in and of itself. Judging by the way the sun reliably winked back at us from the hole nestled there west of the city centre.

“Surely too quick. For me at least.” I remarked.

But I'd always wondered if it might one day stand to meet us from where we made eyes at one another. I wondered if it would blind the whole lot of us. I wondered if this was already in play. I'd hoped. My vision sparkled in some way as I stared and I was sure I had smiled, for a second or three.

""What of the inside?"" 
The Neighbour’s dog hardly ever stopped talking.

It was a stupid question so I called him stupid and pulled my arm away from where I had to assume he had long since assumed he'd snuffed a cigarillo on my wrist. It was only ash there, no burn to be spoken of and so I spoke to him, painlessly.

""Well, why would you want to go in there? What precious little energy, ambition, wonder is there to be well wasted in watching such a thing spin, from the conditioned side?""

He just looked at me, looked at me all stupid. I hit him for it. He yelped, but barely. 

""Have you ever gleaned much of any thing, at all from a man so silent? So polished?"" I asked him, gesturing wildly. 

""Maybe. I don't remember."" He admitted, stupidly. ""You have come to understand it so well, in trying, yeah? Because it is everywhere. I mean, just look at it.""

I stopped blinking for what must've been a minute.

""I am looking. I am here now. Shut up."" I told him.

He shut up. And we watched it spin, but only from where we sat across the street there. It was just safe enough, from there. The concrete was cold and my ass stung. Still we idly watched on.

""Maybe,"" I considered. ""There is something to seeing thousands, and feeling too big for that frame. Too small for the speed of the thing. Always being that way, in the way. Always a world built on stone more sure than you or I, without scale dictated by any such architects. Sans those truly of their own ages, of course.""

Something shook the ground. I lit a clove cigar.

""Of course!"" He laughed, so I frowned. 

A motorbike passed and between the two of us some amorphous slur was left drowned in the roar. Neither of us remembered how we’d gotten there, now. I could tell. I pulled at my coat like it knew dignity, then slumped forward some as I lost minutes to the slivers of light and shadow as they waxed and waned with the churn of the door.

""I don't understand, either. Not really."" He told me. ""Still, sometimes I'll stop, hoping to go past.
Some way in, that is.”

There was a crack that echoed from some distance away, so I only kind of laughed. Someone somewhere had been shot.

""Some way in."" I slurred through the smoke that spilled from my lips, but I was smiling. ""All at once."" I was happy, just thinking about it.

My eyes burned. I adjusted my glasses and he shook his head like a jackass jolting the snow from his saddle. The chain around his neck swung off kilter and I hurriedly fixed it for him, patting mindlessly along his collar.

""You look stupid."" I told him again, leaning back onto my palms to level with the sky as it’s mood made to steadily sour.

I thought of nothing then.

To find any kind of peace or true interest, there must be moments of a particularly dim appreciation. A partial knowing. The compounding of patterns, the very best of functions in one's brain matter, if it were to be consequentially broken like so. It is obvious. We remained only adept enough to connect the dots in God's loneliest locale. It seemed to stretch galaxies. The more we knew, the fewer and farther the hope.

I wondered, wondered in a great shivering spiral of circles. I wondered about nothing then.

The exceeding that I do, really rather willingly—That the others  might as well, too? It is felt to be of greater depths. Because from where you stand, there is no barrier. The air is open. And you may call to your fellows. Though the bargain there, in passing long hallways out in the open. In meeting any threshold as such a stranger to the idea of home; it may feel a great deal like looking down. So surely, you will wonder why. You ought to ask, in fact. 

""But I can not. Can not tell you the amount of times I have slipped past something I needed no push to tread toward. And from there, only fell.""

The air was no longer stale, yet the building’s glossy complexion seemed to dampen with it. It was quiet, I heard nothing then. Bitterly, part of me hoped the dog had gone. He was a fool, anyway. He had begun to smell in the rain, anyway.

""I think—"" He started.

""I wouldn't know."" I mumbled on as I turned to face him. ""You, you would not. You could not know, neither.""

From overhead, it turned somewhat dark. Perhaps the others had seen it coming. I missed the sun as it was swallowed. But the door spun, and men were swallowed up in predictable swells across the street, just the same.

""Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's not enough. Maybe it's worth losing mind. Playing games."" He wibbled on, somehow managing to light the end of another neatly rolled cigarillo. ""Your living is impacted by a wider picture. Not painted there.""

In that moment I recalled. I am missing it, because I am here now. It was never in-fact, missing. I shrugged.

""But that is universal in adversity."" I assured us both. ""Under glory and fear alike, I could not hope to bless any one thing with our sickness.""

It took him a moment. Probably because he was stupid.

""Right. Wouldn't do me any better, more fellows to tick so unpredictable. I have many."" He said.

""There are lots of us. It is enough."" I agreed.

""I think we have to remember that there is no breed of being, among characteristics nor afflictions, that are carved in the shape of the world they will walk. Some closer to fitting, maybe. But I am no outlier, even if I were never so human at all.” He seemed happy, but it concerned me some to see him cry.
“You know?"" He asked, his voice warm.

""Woof!"" I barked back.

The sky split fully and it began to pour. I drank some.

""Well, shit! Life is hard. I understand that."" He told me. I saw multiple prominent chips along the bottom row of his teeth as he grinned. 

The door spun faster on the heels of an old woman as she stumbled. The two younger women behind her were swept into the hole and vanished quickly thereafter. I laughed. We both laughed.

""We ought to carve it up, the same way we do. The same way that could set any of us apart, really."" I suggested.

We both looked on toward the door, and I truly wondered. What floors had we come from, respectively?

""Really?"" The dog clearly wondered too, but I doubted he could recall.",2,1754205968.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

When I was younger, I used to have pretty severe anxiety attacks, but I haven’t had a bad one in several years.

Recently I accepted a new job in a very big city about two hours from where I was previously living, and I moved into my new apartment today. Since my best friends (who helped me move) left to head home to that city, I’ve been fighting through one of the worst anxiety attacks I’ve ever had. It’s making me feel extreme regret and fear about the fact that I went through with this move. I feel this inescapable panic and cannot stop crying and feeling devastated that the previous chapter of my life has ended.

I *know* there was no real future for me in my previous city. I moved there for a job but never wanted to stay long-term (very little to do, none of the things I enjoy, nobody to date, etc). But I did end up growing very attached to the friends I’ve made there - I even lived with two of them for the past two years, and they really became like my family.

I also know that I can’t live with my best friends for the rest of my life - people get married, have kids, change careers, it’s just part of it. I should be excited that I have this new job in a cool new city. And up until today, I WAS excited, despite being anxious about it. But the moment my friends left and I was alone in my apartment, I broke down. I haven’t been able to catch my breath. All I want is to go home - but it’s not my home anymore. That chapter of my life has ended - I will never again live with my best friends, waking up to coffee with them every morning and coming home to their familiar faces. And I am DEVASTATED that time has moved so quickly.

I know these friends will always be part of my life, and I know I’m only a few hours away from my many other friends and family, but I guess I’m just fighting against regret. I was dissatisfied in my previous city, but I was comfortable. And now all I want is that comfort back.

Do you guys ever just… grieve the fact that you’re ultimately on your own? No matter how much you love your people, they still have their own lives and you have to live yours, too.

I found some time alone, enough for me to double check everything before starting my first batch.

I set up my roasting bench, taking the time to double check everything.

Weighed 200 grams of beans, put them in my SR800 with extension tube.

Started Artisan, set fan to 7 and power to 2 before starting.

Started the roast: no bean movement, at all!

I tried increasing the fan to 9 (the maximum): still no movement.

It's been less than a minute, and I can already smell the characteristic smell of roasted coffee, I guess I should stop, something's wrong.

*\*pop\**

Did I hear that right?!

Yup, looks like the beans at the bottom sped run through first and maybe second crack...

I ran the cooling cycle, then dropped my beans in a tray to assess the damage, and pick the burnt beans out of the lot. Hopefully I can save the beans that didn't burn and try again.

Interestingly, while I was running a second (empty) cooling cycle to completely cool the chamber with fan set to 9, the fan noise suddenly increased, as if it got more powerful.

I wasn't touching, not even watching the roaster, still sorting beans, so I don't really know what happened.

Tried adding beans to the chamber again, and to my surprise, there was plenty of movement...

Was my SR800 damaged before I even got started?

For reference, I'm trying to use Artisan, with an ET probe under the chamber (its wire goes in between the two glasses tubes then through a hole in the mesh plate), and a BT probe that goes through the chaff collector into the beans mass, and it looks like Artisan measured an ET above 550ºF only 30 seconds after starting the SR800, which is obviously unexpected...",1,1754205510.0,FreshroastSR800,2,1.0,False

Recently I find writer and together we create this concept:
The main character name is Artyom. His father was loser we can say. He recently lose his job and his wife left him, so now he is alone. One day he get call from hospital. They say his wife and daughter had car accident. Wife died on place, only daughter survive.

Then, in doctor’s office, he learn that she need organs. There is no donors and she can’t survive long. When doctor go out of office, Artyom find some papers with list of people who said their organs can be used if they die.

Here start the game: he must kill those people to save his daughter. After every kill, he see nightmares — this is where psychological horror part comes.

In the end, it turns out all was in his head. He imagined everything. His daughter also dead, and he kill people for nothing.

1mgcuz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1mgcuz0/housemates_driving_me_crazy/,Housemates driving me crazy,"I have 2 roommates and a third person who is an RA who lives in her own unit connected to our main house. I share the master bedroom with my mom & my two cats.

I just need to vent honestly. I’ve been living here since April 2024, and one of my housemates has been living here for about 3 years, and the other housemate came almost a year ago now. We’re all tidy people & we clean up after ourselves and have household chores weekly. It works out. The problems I have with their cleaning is that they constantly put things in the wrong places, that’s all fine, but one of the girls (22yo) has been mixing chemicals every time she cleans, I talked to her about it and told her it was unsafe for her and the rest of us and she laughed in my face, after she didn’t stop I took it up with the RA who put a stop to it, or so we thought, she still does it sometimes & locks herself in the bathroom to secretly do it. (Super unsafe). Another time we had a meeting to discuss the fact that these two girls use our dish scrubber, to clean things with chemicals that shouldn’t be used on dishes afterwards, so we got two scrubbers & talked about which is which. One left on top of the sink for the dishes, and the other placed in a bucket under the kitchen sink with other cleaning products. The same girl who cleans with mixed chemicals, started immediately using our dish scrubber to scrub the trash can, which we told her not to because that’s now unsafe for dishes, and she was very upset. Then we caught her using the one for cleaning (I scrub our kitchen floor with it from time to time) to scrub our dishes & we had to speak with her again. She lost it on my mom & yelled at my mother to just let her do it “her way” while she was slamming things around to intimidate my mother. I told her that “her way” is going to make us sick and that it isn’t okay. She’s from a third world country, and she hasn’t been to school since she was there, which was like 3rd grade. So that’s why she doesn’t know anything really. She also will buy kimchi, and once it’s done she will fill the jar with water and cap it without cleaning it correctly, and it’ll start to grow mold or something in it. She leaves those by the sink for some reason. I’ve thrown about 3 of them away once they got all moldy because it’s unsafe and it smells awful, and every time I threw them away, the next week there would be another one. I asked her to stop doing that because she’s not doing anything with them, they just sit there full of water and mold for weeks. Both of these girls use way too much cleaning products, like we just bought two huge things of fabric softener & detergent, they’re almost gone & we only do laundry once week each person, they shouldn’t be almost empty yet. They also use way too much dish soap, I refill it half way every 2 days & within those two days it’s down to nearly empty. They don’t wash the dishes off well enough so the shared dishes have to be washed again before you use it due to soap still being on the dish. The other girl is also from what I consider a third world country, it’s supposedly developing now, but whatever. Both of these girls eat food that is months old, rotting, whatever. They don’t throw it away. We made fries with a special sauce that was a side to one of our holiday dinners, 3 months later they were still eating the fries & sauce 😭, there’s so many more instances of this, and they’re always complaining they feel sick, like obviously you would because you’re eating shit that is no longer good. The RA isn’t that smart either, we have a coffee maker that we all use, she poured a whole bunch of bleach in it to sanitize it, and my mom said she wouldn’t be using the coffee maker anymore. The RA lashed out saying it’s okay to use bleach on your dishes, which yes, it is, but there is a formula for it. You’re only supposed to use a few drops per a quart of water or something. The other girl straight up runs the coffee machine through with bleach to clean it. This girl also has a huge problem with lying, she CONSTANTLY LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING. Other than that, all of our roommates are Christian zealots and play Christian music 24/7 blasting through the house and I honestly can’t stand it. They also try to shove their beliefs on you or make you pray with them. There’s much more to talk about but this is it for now. ",0,1754204740.0,badroommates,6,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Kansas City Royals vs. Toronto Blue Jays: A Tale of Two Batting Averages (and One Overworked Pitcher)**

The Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays are set to clash in a pivotal AL wild-card showdown, and let’s just say the odds are about as clear as a pitcher’s delivery after 10 cups of coffee. The Blue Jays, despite their “winning environment” as described by Ty France (who went 0-for-4 in his debut like a man playing golf in a hurricane), are the favorites here. But Kansas City? They’re the scrappy underdog with a hot bat and a plan to exploit Toronto’s pitching equivalent of a sieve made of Jell-O. Let’s break it down.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Do Make for a Good Punchline)

The implied probabilities from the decimal odds tell a story of cautious optimism for Toronto. At FanDuel, the Blue Jays sit at **1.7** (+130 in American odds), translating to a **58.8% implied chance to win**. The Royals, at **2.2** (-150), imply **45.5%** odds. But here’s the rub: Toronto’s pitching staff has allowed **5.7 runs per game over 14 games**, which is about the same as a leaky sprinkler system. Meanwhile, Kansas City’s offense is averaging **5.4 runs per game**, which, while not exactly Aaron Judge’s home-run trot, is enough to keep up with the Jays’ pitching equivalent of a toddler in a candy store—excited, unorganized, and likely to spill something.

The spread (-1.5 for Toronto) and total (8 runs) suggest this game could hinge on whether Gausman can avoid turning into a human piñata. Last time out, he was poked for two homers in two innings, which is less of a “ace” and more of a “ace-who-accidentally-joined-the-opposite-team.”

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, New Faces, and Existential Crises

Toronto’s recent loss to Kansas City was so惨 that even Ty France—a man who’s hit 20+ homers in three different leagues—looked up from his 0-for-4 and said, “I’m just here for the vibes.” The Blue Jays’ new additions (Bieber, Varland, France) are like a reality TV show cast: full of po

Kissed on first date. I didn't think things would develop as we slept together soon and past experiences have led to this fizzling out. Instead it's created this expectation I will put out every single time. 

The guy is doing everything else you'd expect in dating with intention of a relationship developing (which is what he said he wanted on first date) daily texting, morning to evening, making plans to go away together, brought food over when I'm working late, had a toothbrush ready and coffee in the morning, let me stay at his place when he went to work so I could work there as my Wi-Fi is down, picked me up from airport in early hours when my flight got stupidly delayed. 

Every single time he sees me, he wants to kiss heavily & passionately, even in public places, and once were alone at mine or his place, jump my bones the moment I get through the door. He's often nervous in the bedroom, saying it's because he finds me so attractive and I'm often then trying to keep him aroused at the same time as trying to get myself in the mood as id barely taken my shoes off before he went for my crotch. Afterwards the date carries on as normal, he's not in a rush to leave or kick me out, and he's often texting me pretty soon after we've seen each other. But on Friday night, after a long day at work, hard physio session and plans to do a movie night and dinner together, I really wasn't feeling getting my clothes off within 10 minutes of arriving and wanted to shut it down, deciding if he reacted badly, it's early on enough to part ways without much hurt on either sides.

I ended up leaving because it was so awkward. He tried to convince me to stay for dinner, telling me he enjoys getting to know me and the other stuff, but I'd already gotten into the headspace of wanting some space to process it all and then promised I'd reach out when I was less upset. I've contacted him about it but the conversation isn't really going anywhere apart from him reiterating it was a dinner date and not just sex. 

Should I even bother? The sex itself is good, but I feel pretty used currently and like he doesn't see me past my body. Sure it's great being told I'm hot, attractive, etc. But it's not what I'm looking for at this stage in my life tbh, I wanted someone who saw and wanted more than that, and I feel like there is a possibility he is saying what I want to hear to keep sleeping with me.

I’m sitting here, in a climate-controlled room, typing on a device that connects me to a global network of information, and all I can think is: this is a magnificent, impossible, fragile house of cards we've built, and we're all just waiting for someone to sneeze.
We've mastered the physical world. Think about it. We built colossal cities that scrape the clouds, we designed systems to deliver clean water and electricity with the flip of a switch, and we have a global supply chain that brings a cup of coffee from a small farm on the other side of the planet to your kitchen table. We have satellites orbiting Earth that make it possible to talk to someone on a different continent in real-time. We've mapped the human genome, cured diseases that once wiped out entire populations, and figured out how to travel faster than sound. We are, without a doubt, a species of builders, creators, and innovators. We've constructed a paradise.
And what's our biggest, most pathetic weakness? Ourselves. After all that mind-bending progress, we're still just a handful of petty squabbles, political disagreements, or online arguments away from the whole thing going sideways. The same internet that connects us is now a cesspool of outrage and misinformation, a tool we use to tear each other down instead of build each other up. We've mastered the laws of physics, but we haven't come close to mastering our own tribalism. We've forgotten that the only thing holding all of this together is a collective, unspoken agreement not to act like animals.
It's like we built a car capable of interstellar travel but can't agree on which direction to drive it. We've become experts in self-sabotage. We've turned our own incredible creations against ourselves, weaponizing every new tool we invent. We've become the living paradox of our own making—a species of incredible genius and staggering stupidity. And the most depressing part? I don't think we even realize it. We’re so busy fighting each other in the mansion we built, we've completely forgotten that we're the only ones who can burn it down.

I got through about half of it before getting really bad diarrhea and ended up being on the toilet multiple times that night. I chalked it up to the Mexican food I ate with hot sauce since there have been times when extra spicy food has been a trigger for me but usually it's fine. I realized it was the chocolate when I tried to eat the rest of the bar the day after and the same thing happened, prompting me to throw the rest out. It seemed to shake up my gut so badly that I was unable to have normal bowel movements and had diarrhea for the next 3 days even after eating meals that I could normally digest with no issues along with terrible gas as well that even kept me up at night. It's only after a week now that it seems to have finally calmed down. 

But the thing is, how could this have happened? I don't have a chocolate allergy and have had no issues eating various chocolate candies before and I sometimes put cocoa powder in my preworkout with no problem. I am slightly lactose intolerant (cant drink normal whole milk or ice cream but cheese and yogurt are fine) but there's no milk in the ingredients listed. I don't think it's caffeine related either since I drink multiple cups of coffee a day with no issue and there certainly couldn't be that much caffeine in a bar of chocolate that compares to a cup of coffee.

It's really perplexing since Googling doesn't seem to give my much information and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of other people having a similar issue. Could it just have been a bad bar in particular? Honestly I would hate to have to give up dark chocolate since I enjoy it quite a bit but I'd like to try and avoid this gut wrecking disaster in the future.",2,1754204346.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

Problems will food may arise during times of shortage or when the diet is not varied and the same foods, which are missing some key micronutrient, are eaten repeatedly   
  
**A.        Meeting Basic Nutritional Requirements**  
Food energy is measured in calories. One thousand calories (cal) is one “large Calorie” (Cal), often denoted as Calorie with a capital C or as kilocalorie (kcal). One thousand calories (or 1 Calorie or 1 kcal) is the amount of energy required to raise one kilogram of water one degree Celsius.   
  
The average adult requires a minimum of 2100 kcal (or 2100 Calories) per day in energy in order to survive. This energy is gained through the consumption of food. Each type of food contains a different amount of energy and the more you eat the more calories you will ingest. If 2100 kcal per day is not met the body starts to consume itself in order to function. Over time the impact of not meeting this requirement is cumulative and results in starvation.   
  
The body also requires a minimum of 46 g of mixed-diet protein per day in order to survive. Protein not only contributes calories but also is a building block for tissue and needed for the body to repair itself. Generally, if you are getting enough calories then you are likely getting enough protein. This might not always be the case in survival situation so care must be taken.   
  
In order to cover the requirement for essential fatty acids it is also recommended that a portion of the total daily energy requirement come from fats and oils. For adults this is 15%, for women of productive age this is 20% and for children under two this is 30-40%. It is important to note however that no more than 10% of this requirement should come from saturated fatty acids which are found in some animal fats and some vegetable oils.   
  
Not only does the body need calories, proteins and fatty acids to function it also require small amount of other nutrients. These are known as micronutrients. Minimum requirements of micronutrients per day are:  
  
Folic Acid – 160 micrograms   
Iodine – 150 micrograms   
Iron – 22 mg   
Calcium – 500 mg   
Vitamin A (retinol) equivalents – 500 micrograms  
Vitamin B1 (thiamine) – 0.9 mg   
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) – 1.4 mg  
Vitamin B3 (niacin) equivalents – 12 mg   
Vitamin B12 – 0.9 micrograms   
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) – 28 mg   
Vitamin D – 3.8 micrograms   
  
At the end of the day you need to ensure that your survival nutrition is as balanced and varied as possible whilst still meeting the caloric needs. An example of nutritional failure in a survival setting were early settlers to North America who feasted on a diet of only rabbit and/or caribou, as they were abundant and tasty. Many of them developed what was known as “rabbit starvation” or “caribou starvation” because rabbit meat is very lean (as is caribou meat at certain times of the year). This very lean meat did not contain much in the way of nutrients or fat… just protein that does not meet the basic nutritional requirements of survival.   
  
**B. Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM)**  
PEM is the result of not getting enough calories or protein. The body will begin to rapidly loose weight. Over time, if not corrected adults will become very weak and waste away. One of three clinical conditions (marasmus, kwashiorkor or marasmic kwashiorkor) will present in children and some adults. These conditions are covered in some detail below.   
  
Children from six months to five years are at the highest risk of PEM. As are people who have an infection which has diminished their appetite while increasing the body’s requirement for energy.    
  
In severe PEM event when calories and protein are re-introduced to the patient there still is a risk of death from hypothermia and/or a condition called re-feeding syndrome that results from electrolyte imbalances and hypoglycaemia. Re-feeding syndrome is covered at the end of this section.   
  
**Marasmus**  
  
Marasmus is the severe wasting of fat and muscle that results from the body consuming itself due to prolonged lack of dietary calories or protein. It can also result from recurring infections with marginal food intake.   
  
The result is someone who looks like they only have skin and bones left as muscle and fat has been self-consumed. The ribs will be very prominent, there is no edema and people may appear to be alert and oriented in spite of their condition. This is the most common form of PEM. The person will be hungry.   
  
**Kwashiorkor**  
  
Kwashiorkor is most common in children from one to four years old, although it can also occur in older children and adults. It is characterized by edema (swelling) that normally starts in the feet and legs and will spread as it progresses to the hands and face. When the tissue over the lower end of the tibia is pressed with your thumb and released a definite pit will remain for a period of three or more second. Due to the swelling the person may look fat and well (or over) nourished and people may regard them as getting adequate nutrition. This is not the case.   
  
Kwashiorkor is sometimes accompanied by changes in hair. Color may become grey or reddish and it may become sparse, loose and straight if normally curly. Skin rashes may develop that look like flaky-paint and dark skin may become lighter in some places. In the skin folds of the legs layers of skin may peel off and may look like burns. The person will have poor appetite and it will be hard to convince them to eat. They will be irritable, miserable and may have given up the will to live.    
  
**Marasmic kwashiorkor**   
  
Both severe wasting of marasmus and the edema of kwashiorkor as described above characterize Marasmic kwashiorkor.    
  
**C. Nutrient deficiencies** 

**Iron Deficiency**  
Iron deficiency is most common widespread nutritional disorder in the developing world. It is most common in young children (6-24 months), women of reproductive age and those who are pregnant. In survival situations a subsistence cereal based (wheat, barley, corn, oats, rye, etc) diet that lacks variety puts people at risk of iron deficiency.  
  
Iron is found in both food of animal and vegetable origin but it is better absorbed from animal sources. Common foods rich in iron include red meat, beans, dark green leafy vegetables and tuber vegetables. The absorption of iron can be increased through concurrently consuming vitamin C. Doubling the vitamin C in the diet will double the iron absorbed. Tea, coffee and some cereals will seriously inhibit the absorption of iron. If tea and coffee are going to be part of the survival diet and iron is scare then they should be consumed two hours before the consumption of dietary iron.    
  
A lack dietary iron will result over time in anemia. In the developing world anemia is often coexisting with other nutritional deficiencies (vitamin A, B, or folic acid) and clinical conditions such as malaria, intestinal parasitic infections and chronic infections. Anemia is a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues. Having anemia can make you feel tired and weak and it is often not clinically apparent until the condition becomes severe. In addition to anemia the other problems associated with iron deficiency include reduced cognitive function and attentiveness and a reduced work capacity.    
  
The person who has severe anemia often has clinically non-specific findings until the condition is severe. They may have pale skin including the mucosa in the mouth and eyelids. They may have have shortness of breath. Diagnosis will either be based on clinical findings plus and examination of diet and/or through laboratory measurement of haemoglobin or hematocrit if available (see the Laboratory Medicine section).  
  
The treatment of iron deficiency is:   
  
1. Increase dietary sources of iron and vitamin C.   
2. Decrease the concurrent consumption of tea, coffee and cereals with iron.   
3. Treat parasitic conditions including malaria.   
4. Supplement with oral iron if available for a period of three months as required:    
\- Children < 2 year – 25 mg / day   
\- Children 2-12 years – 120 mg / day   
\- Adolescents and adults – 600 mg / day   
  
Iron dosages in children should not be exceeded, as it can be toxic.   
  
If you think you will be / are in a situation where iron deficiency is a risk (due to poor dietary intake) then the prevention of iron deficiency can include supplementation. Supplementation can occur as follows:   
\- Children <2 years – 12.5 mg / day   
\- Children 2-5 years – 20-30 mg / day   
\- Children 6-11 years – 30-60 mg / day   
\- Age 12 + - 60 mg / day   
  
Iron dosages in children should not be exceeded, as it can be toxic. It should be noted that some pre-packaged cereals have been iron fortified. These include some survival rations. Check the label.  
  
Iron supplementation can result in black stools (normal), nausea, headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort.   
  
**Iodine Deficiency**   
Iodine deficiency is a geographical problem where the soil is poor in iodine. These are often mountainous areas. Given low iodine in the soil there is subsequently low iodine content of plant foods that grow in the soil and therefore total ingested iodine is low. Children and pregnant woman are at the highest risk.   
  
Lack of iodine is the main cause of preventable brain damage in childhood in the developing world. It gives rise to mental retardation and thyroid enlargement (goiter). The thyroid enlargement is visually disturbing but clinically not important or dangerous.   
  
Most cereals (wheat, barley, corn, oats, rye, etc) will have enough iron in them unless grown in iodine deplete soil. Seafood is the only food that is truly rich in iodine. Store bought table salt in North America is fortified with iodine to ensure dietary exposure.   
  
The prevention of iodine deficiency in survival situations is as follows:   
  
1. Eat survival rations – cereals that have been fortified with iodine.   
  
2. Research before a survival situation if the soil in your area contains enough iodine. If so, consume cereals grown in this soil. Parts of the United States and other first world countries have low iodine content in the soil and this is not a problem limited to the developing world.   
  
3. If you cannot get iodine from crops in your area stockpile iodized salt and use it in food preparation. 10 g / day should be adequate and provide the required 150 micrograms.  
  
4. If you are concerned about stockpiling salt and there is no chance of the soil having iodine then there is the option of consuming pharmaceutical iodized oil orally once a year or having an injection of pharmaceutical iodized oil once every two years. Research will need to be done before the survival situation to determine suitability and dosage.   
  
**Vitamin A Deficiency**   
Vitamin A deficiency is the main cause of preventable blindness in children in the developing world. It can cause night blindness and ocular lesions called xerophthalmia. It is associated with increased mortality when it co-exists with measles. Young children and pregnant women are most at risk of vitamin A deficiency.  
  
Vitamin A is found in green and yellow vegetables and fruits. These include carrots, pumpkins, green leafy vegetables, papayas and mangos. It is also found in some animal proteins. In survival rations you may find that dried skim milk, cereals and vegetable oil is fortified with vitamin A. If it has fortification it will be labeled as such.   
  
Where vitamin A cannot be sourced from dietary means supplementation can occur as follows:  
  
Infants <6 who are not breast fed - 50,000 IU – once   
Infants 6-12 months - 100,000 IU – once every 4-6 months   
Children > 1 year old & Adults - 200,000 IU – once every 4-6 months   
Pregnant and fertile women - Not more than 10,000 per day   
Lactating women - 200,000 IU – once in first 6 weeks after delivery.   
  
A person with vitamin A deficiency may only present with ocular changes despite having other systemic problems. Night blindness (or lack of visual acuity in dim-light) is the first sign and a mother may note that a child starts to bump into things in a low-light environment when they have not done so before. Progression of the condition will occur as the body depletes it’s vitamin A stores and a host of ocular lesion will develop (xerophthalmia). These lesions are best referenced in an ophthalmology reference book and include:  
  
• Night blindness,  
  
• Conjunctival xerosis (the entire conjunctiva may appear dry, roughened, thickened and corrugated, and sometimes skin-like),  
  
• Bitot’s spot (a triangular dry, whitish, foamy appearing lesions which are located more commonly on the temporal side of the eye), and   
  
• Corneal xerosis (dry, hazy appearance of the cornea. It may start as superficial, punctate epithelial lesions. This stage quickly progresses to the stage of corneal melting or keratomalacia).   
  
All of these causes are reversible if treated. Lesions such as corneal ulceration, keratomalacia, corneal scars and xeropthalmic fundus are not fully reversible and will cause chronic issues with sight. Nonetheless, they should be treated.   
  
The treatment for xerophthalmia is vitamin A. It should be administered as follows. If pharmaceutical preparations are not available enhanced dietary supplementation should be utilized if possible.   
  
Immediately on diagnosis:  
< 6 months of age - 50,000 IU   
6-12 months of age - 100,000 IU  
\> 1 year old - 200,000 IU   
  
Then the following day repeat the initial dose. Then two weeks later repeat the initial dose for a total of three doses.   
  
The common side effects from high-dose vitamin A include nausea, vomiting, inability to sleep, bulging fontanelle in children. These are transient and will disappear.   


**Vitamin B1 Deficiency (Beriberi)**  
Vitamin B1 is known as thiamine. It is found in whole-grain cereals, pulses (e.g. dried beans), groundnuts and some vegetables. Red meat and dairy products are moderate sources. It is abundant in rice, but is removed when the rice is milled. The lighter the milling of rice, the more vitamin B1 that is preserved. About half of vitamin B1 is lost in the cooking of cereals and vegetables. This loss is increased if the cooking water is not consumed. The body needs about 1 mg of thiamine a day.   
  
In survival diets that consist of polished white rice, cereals or cassava as the primary food source vitamin B1 deficiency is a risk.    
  
A vitamin B1 deficiency causes a condition known as beriberi. It can occur in both children and adults. It occurs in two forms – wet and dry. Wet beriberi is caused by heart enlargement and failure leading to acute swelling and problems breathing. Untreated it is fatal. Dry beriberi is a more chronic condition and weakness, weigh loss, and disturbed sensation is seen. Eventually a progressing, ascending paralysis of the fingers, toes, and limbs sets in. Reflexes on examination will be diminished and in severe cases when the person is asked to squat they will be unable to stand.   
  
If thiamine is available:   
  
Critically ill:  
  
50-100 mg of thiamine slow IV.    
50-100 mg of thiamine PO immediately after the IV.  
10 mg of thiamine PO or IM once a day for one week.    
3-5 mg of thiamine PO per day for six weeks.   
  
Moderately ill:  
  
10 mg of thiamine PO or IM once a day for one week.   
3-5 mg per day orally for six weeks.  
  


**Vitamin B3 Deficiency (Pellagra)**  
Vitamin B3 is known as niacin (also known as nicotinic acid). It is found in pulses, nuts, meat (especially liver), milk, cheese, fish and lightly milled cereals. The average person requires 12-20 mg per day of niacin or niacin equivalents.   
  
The survival diet that is primarily corn (maize) and/or sorghum, especially when these staples have been in storage for prolonged periods of time may result in vitamin B3 deficiency.    
  
When the diet is chronically short of vitamin B3 or there is an excess of isoleucine a condition called pellagra can present. The patient will develop a symmetrical rash on the skin, most notability the face where it is exposed to sunlight. The effects of pellagra are known as the four D’s – dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and ultimately death. The mouth will be painfully sore and denuded on examination.   
  
The administration of vitamin B3 (as nicotinaminde) will rapidly reverse the course of the illness. Oral dosing of 300 mg per day for three weeks should be undertaken. Once started diarrhea will cease, the mouth will correct itself and mental deficiency will resolve within days. Even in the sickest patient vitamin B3 is rapidly absorbed in the stomach and oral administration is adequate.   


**Vitamin C Deficiency (Scurvy)**  
Vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid) is primarily found in citrus fruits and some vegetables, including green leafy vegetables. It is found in good quantity in some tubers such as pulses that are sprouting (e.g. peas, beans, lentils, and chickpeas) sweet potatoes and potatoes. Some non-citrus fruits may contain vitamin C. Half of all vitamin C content is destroyed when the food is cooked and the loss is greater if the cooking water is not consumed.   
  
Fresh animal milk (cow, goat, camel) contains a good amount of vitamin C but care must be taken to minimize the risk of infection from drinking fresh milk. This is normally done by heating the milk that results in the destruction of the vitamin C.   
  
Survival rations may be fortified with vitamin C. Commonly this occurs in cereal / pulse blended foods, cereal flour, orange drink and tomato paste.   
  
A survival situation such as a drought that limits access to fresh fruit and vegetables may place a person at risk of vitamin C deficiency, which is known as scurvy. Vitamin C is also important as it enhances the absorption of iron. See iron deficiency elsewhere in this chapter.    
  
Where dietary means cannot be secured (e.g. 15 mL of fresh citrus juice, 1/4 of an orange, 30 g of sprouted pulses, 20 g of green leafy vegetables, a small tomato) scurvy can be prevented by supplementation with 10 mg of oral vitamin C taken by pill or powder.   
  
The person with scurvy will have gum swelling between the teeth and swollen and painful elbows, knees and hips. On examination if the gums are swollen but there is pus you are likely looking a gingivitis that may or may not be concurrent with a vitamin C deficiency. The person may easily bruise and bleed and bleeding may be seen between the teeth. Pain “in the bones” may be felt from small, localized bleeding which occurs on the surface of the bones. In severe cases infants will assume a “frog like” position and adults will assume a reclining position with legs contracted. Both will be reluctant to straighten their legs for fear of pain.   
  
Treatment for scurvy involves providing vitamin C. 1 gram of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) given once a day for 2-3 weeks will correct the condition. It will return if a dietary source of vitamin C or supplementation is not then commenced.   
  
**Vitamin D Deficiency (Rickets)**  
Vitamin D is important for the growth of bones and cartilage. It is generally acquired through exposure to sunlight. It is most common in infants and young children. A survival situation that results in loss of access to the sun (either through environmental conditions or prolonged underground sheltering) risks vitamin D deficiency.   
  
A lack of vitamin D will result in a clinical condition called rickets. It is still common in northern Africa and southern Asian countries where children are kept indoors due to prolonged periods and/or prolonged periods of cloudy weather. The best way to prevent rickets is exposing the naked infant or child to the sun for 10-15 minutes a day. In situations where sunlight exposure is not an option consuming food that is fortified with vitamin D or taking supplements may be an option.   
  
Early signs are enlargement of the bones and cartilage at the ends of the long bones (ankles and wrists) as well as the ribs. The skull in children will develop and irregular square shape and the pelvis will become deformed. Walking will be delayed in infants and infants will be more prone to respiratory infections.   
  
The treatment for rickets is 5000 IU of oral vitamin D once a day for six weeks followed by 1000 IU for six months. These are normally in capsules that are derived from fish liver oil.    
  
**D. Refeeding Syndrome**  
People who have eaten nothing, or very little for periods of over five days have a number of physiological changes. Most notably there is a huge decrease in blood glucose, decreases in insulin, increases in glucagon and a shift of potassium, phosphate and magnesium into the serum from the cells.   
  
It would seem like the treatment of starvation would be rapid refeeding but this can actually be quite harmful. As soon as the body ingests any quantity of oral glucose it will result in rapid insulin secretion by the body. This triggers a number of problematic cascades including:  
  
• sodium retention (leading to fluid overload, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias and death).   
  
• Increased glucose metabolism (leading to a further decrease in thiamine in the body and metabolic acidosis and/or a condition called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome).    
  
• A shift of potassium, calcium and magnesium from the serum into the cells rapidly (leading to electrolytic imbalance and tetany, cardiac arrhythmias and death).   
  
• A shift of phosphate from the serum into the cells rapidly (leading to electrolytic imbalance and anemia, hemolysis, diaphragm weakness, dyspnea, weakness, anorexia, constipation, ataxia, tremors, delirium, coma and death).   
  
Nothing good will happen if you feed someone rapidly who has been starving. It is hard not to do so. The person may be begging for food!   
  
The treatment of someone who has been starving often involves complicated re-feeding regimes in you read the literature. Given you are not running a humanitarian nutritional emergencies station many of these options will be too complex or beyond your reach. That being said, there are still some options to manage the person with severe malnutrition as to prevent re-feeding syndrome.   
  
**Step 1 - Evaluation**   
Conduct a suitable medical history and physical assessment to ascertain your start point. Note when urine was last passed, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, intake during the last five days and the course of events leading up to the malnutrition and current state.   
  
Gather a full set of vital signs including weight. Look for abdominal distention, bowel sounds and temperature. Assess the eyes, mouth and skin. Record your findings.   
  
Look for pitting edema in the ankles and lower legs. If symmetrical, consider causes that are in addition to malnutrition such as pre-eclampsia (in pregnant women), heart failure, beriberi (see above), severe proteinuria or nephritis. A urinalysis, if available, may be helpful (see laboratory medicine chapter).    
  
If possible, get a blood glucose reading.   
  
For adults (18+) the calculation of body mass index might be helpful in classifying the extent of the malnutrition. It is calculated by taking the body weight (in kg) and dividing it by the square of the height (in meters).   
  
18.5 and over – Normal   
17.0 – 18.49 – Mild malnutrition   
16.0 – 16.99 – Moderate malnutrition   
less than 16.0 – Severe malnutrition   
  
**Step 2 – Treat** **Life-Threatening** **Problems**  
On examination you might note hypothermia, dehydration and/or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). These should be corrected immediately over the first 48 hours at a rate that reflects the seriousness of the condition.   
  
Hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dL or < 3 mmol/L) is a known cause of death during the first two days of treatment. It may be caused by serious systemic infections or due only to the malnourishment. It may co-exist with a low body temperature (< 36.5 C), lethargy, limpness and altered consciousness. Even if you do not have the means to measure for blood glucose you should suspect it and treat it. More harm will come from not treating it than treating it. If the patient can be roused give frequent, small amounts oral sugar solution until fully alert. Feeding can then begin (see below). If the patient cannot be roused techniques such as buccal glucose paste, IV glucose or glucose by NG tube must be considered. The goal is to return the person to normal mentation so they can eat without the risk of aspiration. Regular eating (every 2-3 hours both day and night over the first two days) will stabilize glucose levels.    
  
Dehydration is often overestimated. A number of varied situations may be present:   
  
• Mild dehydration with watery diarrhea, thirst, sunken eyes, a normal radial pulse, normal temperature in the hands and feet, urine production and irritableness. This is often treatable with oral fluids.   
  
• Severe dehydration with watery diarrhea, lack of desire to drink, sunken eyes, a weak radial pulse, cold temperature in the hands and feet, reduced urine production and lethargy. This often is treatable with the administration of small and very frequent (once every 15 minutes) oral fluids until the person starts to perk up. Sometimes however it may require fluids through other means.   
  
If you are not are not seeing watery diarrhea, someone who refuses to drink, does not have sunken eyes, is missing a radial pulse, has cold hands and feet, is apathetic or lethargic when you should consider that they may be very, very sick with septic shock either established or looming. Immediate antibiotics, correcting hypothermia, dehydration, electrolytic imbalances, hypoglycemia and re-feeding are your only hopes of saving this person.  
  
For cases of severe dehydration with malnutrition there is a high chance that a potassium deficiency also exists with abnormally high levels of sodium. As such commercial oral rehydration solutions (ORS) should not be used as they are sodium rich. One option is to dilute the standard ORS by 50% and add 25 g / L of sugar. 70 – 100 mL of this ORS can be given per kg over 12 hours. Start with 5 mL/kg every 30 min for the first two hours then 5-10 mL/kg per hour.   
  
If respiratory rate and/or pulse rate increase, the jugular veins become distended or there is increasing edema stop rehydration.   
  
**Step 3 – Treat Other Problems**  
On examination you might suspect a concurrent infection, either systemic or parasitic. These should be treated as soon as possible to minimize the risk of death and set the conditions for refeeding. Treatment will likely take up to seven days.   
  
If you detect other micronutrient deficiencies along with the starvation you can start correcting these now. See elsewhere in this chapter. Total correction may take up to six weeks. Iron should not be started until day five of treatment.   
  
**Step 4 – Refeeding**   
The literature talks about starting the F-75 and F-100 diets. These are difficult if not impossible to make these completely in a survival setting.    
  
**Children**  
For the first few days a simple diet can be made consisting of, 25 g of dried skimmed milk (or 35 g of whole dried milk), 70 g of sugar, 35 g of cereal flour and 27 g of vegetable oil. It is placed in 1L of water and boiled for 5-7 minutes. Vitamins are then added if you have them. If fresh cow’s milk is going to be used use 300 mL of it versus the dried milk and decrease the vegetable oil to 17 g. Each 1 L will yield 75 kcal of energy.   
  
Go slow to avoid shocking the body and allowing physiological imbalances to correct themselves. Frequent feedings in small amounts. Every 2-4 hours including at night. Targets are as follows:  
  
0-6 years old - 80 kcal/kg per day. Do not exceed 100 kcal/kg per day.   
7-10 years old – 75 kcal/kg per day.  
11-14 years old – 60 kcal/kg per day.  
15-18 years old – 50 kcal/kg per day.  
  
Do not exceed these targets. To do so risks metabolic imbalance. To not meet these requirement results in continued breakdown of the body. If someone is unable or unwilling to eat, they will need to be fed by NG tube. Weak children can be fed by syringe.    
  
When hunger has returned (this is the only trigger to progress the diet) after a few days and physiology corrects itself the diet can be shifted to a formula to 80 g of dried skimmed milk, 50 g of sugar and 60 g of vegetable oil. It is placed in 1L of warmed boiled water and mixed. Vitamins are then added if you have them. Each 1 L will yield 100 kcal of energy.   
  
Again, there will be a requirement to go slow to risk shocking the body and leading to heart failure continue with frequent feedings in small amounts. Every two hours including at night. The same targets should be maintained for at least two days after you have shifted diets. Feeds can then be shifted to six times a day. After a week, feeding can return to normal pattens with the goal of making up lost weight. Care and attention should be taken to ensure proper caloric and micronutrient intake.   
  
**Adults**  
Energy should come from as close to 5% protein and 32% fat as possible. Avoidance of high protein and fat feeding initially will be required to prevent re-feeding syndrome.   
  
Feed every two including at night. The goal for the first week nonetheless, using available foods with sugar and vitamin supplementation should aim for:  
  
19-75 years old – 40 kcal per kg per day.  
Over 75 years old – 35 kcal per kg per day.   
  
When hunger has returned (this is the only trigger to progress the diet) the targets should be maintained but the source of energy should shift to as close to 12% protein and 53% fat as possible in order to prevent re-feeding syndrome. Feeds should continue every two hours for two days using this new diet and then progress to feeds less frequently (but in greater volumes) six times a day. After a week, feeding can return to normal pattens with the goal of making up lost weight. Care and attention should be taken to ensure proper caloric and micronutrient intake. The person should be followed clinically until calculated body mass index is over 18.5

1mgcpjz,https://i.redd.it/8j925dwo5rgf1.jpeg,Cooking Food,"The Law of Assumption is truly one of the simplest things in the world, but people are constantly overcomplicating it like they’re trying to invent something new. In reality, it works just like basic, everyday cooking. 

Let’s say you want to eat rice. You already know what you want. You get the rice. You put water in. You turn on the flame. You cover it. And then… you walk away. You don’t obsessively hover over it. You don’t keep lifting the lid every thirty seconds asking, “Is it done yet?” You don’t panic midway and throw in sugar or salt or a different grain just because someone told you their rice cooked faster with it. You don’t suddenly switch to making pasta just because your neighbor said they got results quicker. You trust that once the fire is on and the process is set, the food is cooking. Period. Simple. Normal. Logical.

Now look at how people treat the Law of Assumption. Instead of just choosing what they want, assuming it’s already theirs, and staying mentally locked into that version of reality like the rice on the stove — they go completely insane with it. They pick what they want, then immediately start looking for a technique. Then they question if the method they used was the right one. Then they change their affirmations. Then they read a new tip and think they need to use that too. Then they panic because it hasn’t shown up in three days. Then they do shadow work, inner child healing, EFT tapping, sleep hypnosis, and chakra balancing, all in one week, hoping maybe one of these things will push the “magic button.” It’s like watching someone throw in garlic, ketchup, sugar, coffee powder, and toothpaste into a pot of plain white rice and wondering why it tastes horrible. The result isn’t showing up, not because the law doesn’t work but because the person never gave it a chance to cook properly in the first place.

The truth is, assuming your desire is done is exactly like putting the rice on the stove and walking away knowing it’s cooking. You don’t freak out. You don’t rush. You don’t touch it. You don’t test the fire or doubt the heat. You just know it’s working. That’s what a true assumption is, mental certainty that overrides everything else. But people don’t do that. They think they need to “help” the law. They think it’s not enough to just decide and persist. So they mix ten different energies, stress themselves out, and spend more time jumping between strategies than actually living in the end. Then they act shocked when nothing is happening.

The food isn’t ready, not because you didn’t cook it but because you never let it sit on the damn stove without interfering. You kept changing the flame. You added random ingredients. You didn’t trust the simplicity of the process. That’s exactly what happens in manifestation. When you assume something is done and stick with it, the reality has no choice but to harden. It cooks. It forms. It manifests. But if you keep looking at the 3D, changing your assumptions, switching your state, testing methods, timing it, and panicking when results don’t show up fast enough, you are literally stopping it from working. It’s like turning off the stove every five minutes and expecting fully cooked rice.

So stop making it difficult. You’re not broken. The Law isn’t broken. You’re just trying to cook a simple one-step meal using a 40-page cookbook written by people who don’t even eat the same food. Choose what you want. Assume it’s done. Persist mentally, not by forcing or repeating, but by living from the state that it’s already real. When you do this, the 3D has no choice but to catch up. And it will. But only if you stop stirring the pot every two seconds.

The Law of Assumption is not a mystery. It’s not a secret recipe. It’s not complicated. It’s basic, direct, and stupidly powerful — if you leave it alone and let it do what it’s meant to do. Just like fire turns raw food into something edible, your assumption turns desire into reality but only when you stop messing with it and give it room to unfold. Assume. Persist. Let it cook.

And I seem to remember one of his lessons teaching that emotions and thoughts are like clouds that come and go, but the ""inner sky"" is always present. And the sky is the real you, but the clouds are not. 

I have discovered something. I can see the inner sky when there is a high contrast. During a period of high emotion, I can understand the sky. Earlier today I spilled a pot of coffee, Flashes of anger rose up and tried to take over. 

But I remembered the Maharshi's words ""Who feels the anger""? And immediately I could see that the anger was only a temporary generation. And that if I just payed attention to the sky instead, the anger would disappear. It could not remain. 

But I find it difficult to see the inner sky without something to contrast it against, like the anger. Is there any guidance here for this?   
  
Thank you

Remember that all Women are Goddesses and should be treated as such! Here are a few suggestions on how you can serve your Superiors :

If you are on line and there is a Woman behind you, let Her go before you

If you are going out to pick up something for lunch ask your coworker what She wants don’t accept Her money

Find out how your Female coworkers like Their morning coffee/tea and bring Them drinks every morning. In fact find out what They like for breakfast and bring Them breakfast.

Leave Waitresses a 30% tip or $10 whichever is greater.

Only go to Female professionals: doctors, dentists, attorneys, ophthalmologists, tax accountants, financial advisors, etc.

Shop at Women owned stores, restaurants and farm stands.

When you are at a gas station and a Woman pulls up behind you, tell Her you just got a promotion at work and you want to treat Her to a full tank of gas. Only buy premium gasoline and pump it for Her so She doesn’t have to get out of the car

Elderly Women are nothing less than Goddesses with wisdom and They need to be served as well. Help an elderly Goddess cross an intersection, carry Her bags home, if at a supermarket push Her cart to Her car and load Her groceries. It goes without saying if you live near an elderly Goddess check in on Her to see if needs anything daily.

At work many positions of power are still held by males but thankfully that’s changing! If you are one of those males support Women anyway you can. Promote a Female employee, during bonus times reward your Female employees and hire Women only.

You are out to dinner and you see a table of Women.  Call Their server over and tell him/Her to bill your credit card. The server can’t tell the Women until They ask for the check and the server can’t tell the Women it was you.  Tip the server according to rule 4. This can also be Women with children.

Volunteer at a Women’s shelter. Donate money as well.

Vote for Female candidates, officials and judges. Volunteer for Female candidates and financial support Female campaigns.

If you are stockholder vote against male members of the board and vote Female members of the board. Enter proposals for greater representation of Female employees at all levels and that the company source goods from Female owned small businesses.

Compliment Women daily with meaningful thoughts like: “I love your smile.” “Blue is a terrific color for you.” “I love your hair.” “You have the most beautiful eyes.”

Treat Women with respect. Always say things Yes Ma’am or No Ma’am until She tells you to call her something else. Stand when a Woman arrives or leaves a table, hold doors open, etc. always say Thank You and Please.

Go to a Nail Salon and tell the manager you want to pay for the nail treatments of the next 5 customers. The manager cannot tell the Women until They are finished and the manager cannot give you credit. Tip the nail salon workers very generously. you can also offer to randomly pay for a strangers hairstyle at a beauty salon. 

The list is a start. Don’t feel limited to only these ideas. The point is Women are Goddesses and should be treated as such until we all live in a true Gynarchy.",8,1754203407.0,Gynarchism,4,0.91,False

For context: I’ve never used a Mac before. I’m coming from a Windows laptop, and while I’ve had an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch for years, this is my first time going all-in on the Apple ecosystem.

MacBook Air M4 (13”)
Originally I was going to get a refurbished one just to try macOS, but now I’m leaning toward the new M4. I’ll use it for writing, email, spreadsheets, home finance, and watching films.
→ Is 16GB RAM enough for this kind of use, or is 24GB worth it for longevity?
→ Any tips for someone moving from Windows to macOS?

iPhone 16e
Replacing my 2020 SE. I use my phone for calls, podcasts, Spotify while walking, and occasional browsing.
→ Anyone using the 16e for similar light use? Happy with battery and performance?

iPad (11”)
I have an old iPad Air 2 which is limping along, it’s currently sat on my desk and I use it to listen to Spotify or podcasts as the battery is no good now. I don’t need an iPad Pro—just something for note-taking, reading, and annotating documents. Considering the Magic Keyboard Folio so I can take it out to write in coffee shops when I don’t want to use a full laptop, and Apple Pencil.
→ Is the new iPad Air (M3 or non-M) the best fit here? Storage isn’t a big concern.

Apple Watch
Still using a Series 5. I use it for fitness tracking, notifications, and calls when my phone’s in my bag.
→ Is there any real reason to upgrade if I’m not chasing new health features?

AirPods
I’ve never owned AirPods—just used cheap generic earbuds until now. I mostly listen to podcasts, take calls, and use Spotify while walking.
→ Should I go for the standard AirPods or the AirPods Pro? I’m not chasing audiophile quality, but I do want a secure fit and decent noise isolation.

It’s Sunday morning. The streets are quiet and lazy as if they too are on a holiday. Nobody’s out. 

Someone’s basking under the sun in their balcony with a newspaper in one hand and tea in another. 
Someone’s on call with their plumber asking them to come and repair the flush because obviously, what is Sunday for the plumbers. They don’t know what it means, they don’t know English.
Someone’s basking under the sun with iced coffee in one hand and phone in the other trying to post a selfie on social media with the caption “No one kisses better than the Sun.” Funny how life and time (which can be used interchangeably) change.

A white car, which was washed 30 minutes ago by its 57 year old owner, sits there staring at other unclean cars. (Do cars have feelings?)
Every street has a couple of dogs that they unknowingly adopt and own. Like an accidental kid for a couple after which they can’t do anything but give it attention, feed it and try loving it……….sometimes.

“No no no not again!” shouted Ajit, the owner of the clean white car as he saw from his balcony that one of the street dogs had peed on his car. Again.

This was the 30th day in a row that that dog had peed on that same car.

“You son of bitc- (well). That’s it! I’m done! I’m going to file a complaint against this waterfall in the name of a dog!”

“Ping. Time to meditate for 30 minutes.” the phone notification rang.

“Ugh! You think I want a calm mind and peace when there’s a dog who pees?!” 

Ajit, in his late 50s, was new to technology. It’s not his fault he did not know that notifications don’t talk back. 
This comes off as no surprise that Ajit was actually getting ready to go to the police station.
No one can blame him for this. How else can a retired man be productive if he does not have kids to be disappointed in, wife to disappoint and friends to do both.

He leaves his house, and then drives away in what is now the urinal of the dog.

He reaches the police station. He sits in front of the police inspector (or whoever writes the complaint. Law is confusing).

“Yes? What brings you here?” the inspector asked. Ajit gets stuck for a second because it just struck him that this is also the first thing his therapist used to ask back when he believed in the existence of mental health. 
He shrugs off the thought and comes back to reality.

“Inspector, I am done! I can’t live like this! I want peace, I want justice!”

“Look, neither am I your therapist who’s going to bring you peace (shit) nor do I have the time for the build-up. Just tell me what is the issue?” the inspector asked.

“This dog, sir. This dog keeps peeing on my car everyday! Everyday! He appeared from nowhere 30 days back and now he’s been doing this to my car!”

“Do you have history of any severe mental illness or anything?” the inspector asked calmly.

“What! You think I am crazy? Just check my car! It was originally white. Now it has turned off-white because of that dog!”

“Sir, we have far more important issues and cases to solve. We cannot entertain you in this matter. Sorry.”

“Far more important issues? What could possibly be more important than this?”

“Ideally, I should not be sharing this at this point of time, but okay. We’re dealing with this one very important case - A young boy posted a selfie this morning on his social media and had written “No one kisses better than the sun” on it. That’s a serious offence. Kiss is such an explicit word and Sun is the God. How can he write both these words together?! We have taken that boy into custody and have been diving deep into this case.”

“Poor boy. He could’ve been out of trouble had he rather peed on the sun.” Ajit murmured.

“How about you try parking your car somewhere else, sir? Maybe that could work.” the inspector suggested.

“Uh actually, my mother always told me that I should always park a car facing south because it’s auspicious. There’s no other place where I could do the same. Although my wife used to always suggest the opposite. That lady was dangerous and a menace.”

“Your wife? Where is she?” the inspector asked.

“Well, she left me and my house the day she found out that I had sold all her ancestral jewellery to buy this car. It was always my dream. I was running short on money. So I had to do it. While leaving she said she’ll come back for revenge. That was scary because she takes revenge seriously, you have no idea.” 

“Right. Then what happened?” 

“She didn’t inform anyone, including her family, that she had left. Days and days later her father filed a complaint that she’s missing. When I found that out I sneaked out to hide and switched my house to start living in this new locality. “

“And I’m guessing the police couldn’t find your wife?” the inspector asked.

“Of course not. They had other important cases to deal with. Although I did get a call from someone, who was apparently someone from her family, that she passed away. I never went to see the body but good riddance! Phew!”

I should have kept walking. I should have ignored the man slumped against the alley wall, blood darkening his shirt. I should have known that a creature with eyes like his wasn’t meant to be saved.

There’s also a particular kind of regret that comes with realizing you’ve just invited an apex predator into your home. It's somewhere between “I shouldn’t have texted my ex” and “let’s see if the week-old milk is still good.”

Fair warning: if you’re looking for a heroine who doesn’t swear, has her life together, and doesn’t make questionable decisions daily, you’ve come to the wrong place.

Otherwise, strap yourself into the shit show they call my life and hold on to your granny panties – this is going to be a bumpy ride.

That two-timing, butt-munching, flea-invested douche-canoe!

The bartender across from me is staring at me like I’m the creature from the blue lagoon. Probably because my lips and tongue are stained azure from the six blue curacao and lemonade cocktails I’ve sucked down in the past hour.

I know what you’re thinking – how is she still sitting upright after so much alcohol? Well, my lovelies, this curvy girl’s size and fast metabolism has helped me drink seasoned alcoholics under the table when the time called for it. Yay me!

That doesn't mean I’m not feeling the effects, though. I have a distinct suspicion that when I finally decide to lift my ass from this barstool, my equilibrium is not going to be top-notch. Oh well, I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.

I should have known when I woke up this morning, and my coffee machine was on the fritz, that shit was going to get rough today. That machine has been my partner in crime through two years of college, moving house four times and many mornings of hangovers or one-night stands.

As soon as I switched it on this morning, there was a sudden spark before the back of the contraption burst into flames. I was stunned for all of two seconds before I realized that I was the only adult in the house, and it was my responsibility to stop the fire from spreading and my whole house from burning to the ground.

Luckily, I remembered that according to Professor Google, you should use baking soda to smother an electrical fire, not water, like in usual cases. So, I rushed to my pantry and grabbed the box that had rarely been used (because I can’t bake for shit) and doused that fucking fire like my life depended on it. Come to think of it, my life did depend on it. Huh.

My second clue should have been when my newest employee quit via Instagram DM. Very professional, I know.

A week ago, she begged me to look past her young age and give her a chance. This would also be her first job. I reluctantly agreed because I remembered that I once, too, was a new addition to the workforce and struggled to find someone to believe in me. And look at how that turned out.

Calling the bartender over, I slide my empty glass towards him, “Another, please, barkeep.”

“I’m sorry, ma’am, but I need to cut you off.”

“What! Why?” I ask, outraged, realizing my volume control button might be broken when a few heads swivel my way. Oh, bite me.

“Because the hotel has a strict policy that non-hotel guests are only allowed to use the bar until 10:00 pm.”

I look at him warily because this policy sounds like a load of bullshit to me. Is he trying to get rid of me without offending me? Some Karen probably complained about the large, fat single lady who was drowning her sorrows in vats of alcohol. Well, fuck you, Karen.

I glance at my wristwatch and give him my sweetest smile, “I’ll make you a deal. It’s currently 9:45 pm. If you serve me one more drink, I’ll tip you a crisp 50-dollar bill.”

The look in his eyes tells me I was successful in my negotiation tactics. “Fine, but I must ask you to hand me your keys. I’ll call you a cab once you’re done.”

With a huge smile, I slide my hand into my purse to hand them over. “You have yourself a deal, my good sir.”

Turning around to mix my drink, I catch him rolling his eyes at me. He’s probably fed up with drunk customers who think copious amounts of alcohol will solve their problems. Judgy much?

Sipping on my last cocktail of the night, I think back to the moment I walked into Steven’s apartment to find him balls-deep in my previously mentioned ex-employee. Yeah, you heard me right.

Steven had popped into my bookstore a few times in the last week. Nothing odd about that. He even introduced himself to Kylie, my new employee. Nothing odd about that either. It was unusual, though, when I found them huddling in a corner yesterday, whispering and giggling together.

And because I was hyper-focused on the new vampire smut books that had arrived that morning and where I would be displaying them, I didn’t give it much thought. Because having a dark, broody, dangerous man claim you as his for all eternity trumps me worrying about whatever that was.

Gemma, my 62-year-old employee, had sent me home early today (as if I wasn’t the one paying her salary) to prepare for a function I had to attend with Steven at his office tonight. On the way home, I realized that the pair of shoes I needed for the evening was still at his place. So, I popped over to his apartment, intent on being in and out in minutes.

What awaited me will haunt me for days. Probably months. Most likely years.

Due to his bedroom being in the back of the apartment, I initially didn’t hear the noises when I slipped inside using a copy of the key he gave me two weeks ago. But after about five steps down the hallway, the sounds coming from behind the closed door made me pause for about 2.5 seconds – my gut screaming at me.

When I slowly pushed the door open, trying to prolong the moment of seeing my world get tee-peed by used toilet paper, my mind ping-ponged between screeching like a banshee, laughing hysterically like an evil witch, or crying like a kid who just lost his pet axolotl.

The only way to forget what I saw is most likely to bleach my eyeballs. Will my health insurance cover that procedure?

Chapter 2: Harley

“What. The. Actual. Fuck?”

Those were the only words that my brain could formulate at that moment.

Let me give you some backstory so you can understand my surprise, nay shock, at what I came upon in that room.

Steven and I’s sex life has always been mediocre. He never wanted to use toys in the bedroom. The only positions he knew were missionary and me giving him a blowjob. Is that even a position? I digress.

He went down on me once. Afterward, he told me he didn’t know what the big deal was about giving oral sex to a woman because it didn’t give him any pleasure. Well, duh, dickwad, that’s the whole point.

Giving oral to a woman should be something the guy enjoys. He should do it because he wants to, not because he has to. All just in the hope of her returning the favor. Chivalry is most definitely a lost art.

For the past eight months of our relationship, I’ve begged him to try different positions and interesting toys. Once, I even showed up at his apartment with only lingerie underneath a raincoat to spice things up. I was shot down quicker than a convicted criminal in front of a firing squad. What an ego boost that was.

So, to see him on top of Kylie in a sixty-nine position was surprising. But what was even more shocking was the fact that she was fucking his ass with a dildo that could compete with a soda can in width. Not to mention the studded dog collar around his neck. I did like the red bunny ears he was sporting, though.

The four words of surprise that I breathed caught their attention. They froze instantly, their eyes growing to the size of dinner plates. When the green dildo in Steven’s ass suddenly popped out due to Kylie having dropped her hand in surprise, and it smacked her on the forehead, I lost it.

I almost pissed myself in hysterics, wrapping my arms around my stomach. Tears started leaking from my eyes, making my vision blurry. But not blurry enough not to see the cock cage fastened around Steven’s flaccid dick when he got up from the bed.

“Harley, baby...” he started saying, but I held up my hand to halt the pathetic excuses or gaslighting attempts that would most certainly begin pissing from his mouth.

“Whatever this is,” I said as I waved my finger in a circular motion in their direction, “I hope it was worth the end of our relationship.”

Strolling over to the closet, I took out the pair of shoes I originally came for (they were freaking expensive, mind you) and then left without saying another word. The other few things of mine at Steven’s place were inconsequential – a toothbrush, a coffee mug he gave me, a framed photo of us in front of the fireplace at my house.

They were both still mumbling and sputtering behind me as I was walking out of the room, but I was done with their bullshit. I threw his key onto his kitchen counter and strolled out the front door. As the door slammed shut behind me, I heard Steven begging, “Harley, please, don’t leave me.” That’ll be a hard no from me, dipshit.

I had left his building and unthinkingly turned left, not knowing where I was going. It just needed to be far away from him.

After about 30 minutes of mindless wandering, a couple of girls strolling a few feet ahead of me entered a hotel and into this bar. I followed, them being none the wiser that they were aiding me to celebrate my newfound freedom and emancipation from Steven Douche Canoe Stevens. Who calls their kid by the same name as their surname? Heathens, that’s who.

That was about two hours ago, and the alcohol at last started doing its job, numbing the anger and shame that lay heavily in my chest.

In hindsight, I don’t think I truly loved Steven. I might have liked him at a certain point, but I’ve just been going through the motions the last few months. I was comfortable and didn’t want to rock the boat. I didn’t want to nag or expect too much from him. Mostly, I think, because I didn’t want to be alone anymore.

That’s where the shame comes in. Because I always said I wanted a man who would worship the ground I walked on and do almost anything to keep me for himself. Because I experienced such a relationship when my parents were still alive. And I wanted it for myself. Not just because I’m a selfish bitch, but because I wanted to be that person to someone else in return.

At the start of our relationship, when everything was shiny and new, he treated me well. He complimented me, was a gentleman who opened doors for me, and he spoke to me like an equal. But as time passed, he had become complacent. There were no more surprise flower deliveries at the bookstore or spontaneous late-night walks in the park while we discussed our day. Sex became a chore when he scheduled it for every Wednesday and Saturday evening if we didn’t have any work responsibilities.

And that is why I’m more miffed at myself than him –I let all that shit happen even after I promised myself that I wouldn’t become a statistic when it came to failed relationships.

Is it too late to become a nun and live a life of celibacy? Let’s table that idea for when I’m sober.

Done with my pity party, I raise my hand to call the bartender over. “I want to close my tab, please,” I say when he’s within earshot.

“I’ll call you a cab while I’m at it.”

“No need; I live a couple of blocks down and will be walking home. So, you don’t have to worry about anyone being run over by me on the way home,” I say, giving him an angelic smile. Or at least, I hope it does. Or do I look more like a deranged animal that has been infected with rabies?

The smile must work because he hands me my keys and bill. Not really looking at the total, I scribble down a total that includes his promised 50-dollar tip. Once he’s entered what’s needed for the transaction to be authorized, I tap my card on his card machine, ready to get out of dodge.

He walks off, dismissing me as I slip from my barstool, only to realize that gravity is not my friend right now. That bitch!

Taking it slowly, I carefully walk out of the bar, through the hotel’s lobby, and onto the street, where the cool night air clears my head somewhat.

The walk home is quiet, with only a few people passing me. Weird. Shouldn’t more people be out and about on a Friday night?

About a block from my house, I pass by a darkened alleyway and hear a faint noise. Deciding to ignore it (it’s probably a feral cat that’ll scratch my arms to shit as a thank you for helping it), I keep walking.

But then the distinct noise of someone in pain filters out onto the street from the mouth of the alley, and I stop in my tracks like a deer in headlights. It comes again, this time louder and filled with pain. Fuck me, I’m going to go and look, aren’t I?

I retrace my steps and peer around the corner down the alley. I can see someone on the ground, their back slumped against the wall, but it’s too dark, and I’m too far away to make out any distinct features.

Don’t do it, Harley. Don’t walk down this dark alley towards someone who’s most likely injured, scared, and on the defensive. Someone who could probably be armed. Someone whose attacker could still be lurking in the shadows.

I was thinking of running this oneshot for some of my friends this summer, and I was wondering if anyone had experience with it that could make it more fun/engaging. I plan to have 4 or 5 players. I’ve heard the encounters can be a bit much for level 1, so I’m probably going to bump them to level 2. I’m going to give the list of NPC students and tell everyone to pick one student they have history with for some reason (classmate, friend, rival, crush, etc.) and have them show up at some point along with other random students. 

I’m mostly unsure on how to handle the tasks they’ll be doing, like drink orders and attending the news stand. I want it to be a silly and low-stakes oneshot that’s still entertaining, but I don’t want it to get too repetitive or feel like their characters are just standing around.

taking the water tank out doesn’t change the screen from what I see in screen, it never shows tank empty or missing warnings.

Ive tried all combinationa of powering it off and restarting while holding buttons. Have left it unplugged overnight too.

\[Wide shot. Ichika, stylish in loungewear, is sprawled on a sleek sofa, one hand over her face, the other dangling a film script. Her apartment is a paradox: designer chic but cluttered with empty coffee cups and cosmetic kits. A TV in the background drones with a morning entertainment segment. The clock reads 8:58 AM.\]

**ICHIKA** *(thought bubble)*: Ugh. Call time at ten, script at page fifty… Why did I volunteer for the “serious” role again? Oh, right. Acting.

*(Phone vibrates on table, screen flashes “Yotsuba”)*

**ICHIKA** *(yawning, wry)*: Well, someone’s chipper this morning...



**(Nino & Miku’s Café):**

\[Bright, bustling bakery kitchen. Nino, hair pulled back, is piping elaborate icing roses onto a batch of cupcakes, aggressively determined, while Miku, flour-dusted and serene, is fussing over a row of breads, one of which has deflated horribly. Pastries are everywhere, and a “Soft Opening Tomorrow!” sign is propped against the wall.\]

**NINO** *(to Miku, bossy)*: Miku, your bread looks like it fainted watching horror movies all night. Again.

**MIKU** *(deadpan, under her breath)*: Maybe it just knows how you drive...

*(BEEP, OVERT MESSAGE: “Yotsuba: URGENT! Super Important Sisterly Assembly!”)*

**NINO** *(mock horror)*: Ugh, another “emergency family meeting”? Does she not know this is crunch time?

**MIKU** *(soft smile)*: Yotsuba never met a meeting she didn’t like...



**(Itsuki's School Office):**

\[Itsuki, crisp in a neutral-toned office-skirt and cardigan, cradles a stack of school lesson plans and snack wrappers, sitting behind a laptop. A bulletin board is pinned with “Exam Prep!” notes and a sticky that reads “Do not eat in office”, she’s chewing a chocolate anyway.\]

**ITSUKI** *(monologue)*: Monday: confirm homework, observe 3-A, de-escalate lunchtime bread riots...

*(Cell buzz, message from Yotsuba: “Super-duper sibling gathering! Reply: Yes, yes, YES!” with too many confetti emojis.)*

**ITSUKI** *(sigh, blushing slightly)*: ...She writes like my kindergarteners. But I suppose one sisterly gathering won’t derail things.



**(Yotsuba & Fuutarou’s Home):**

\[Small, lived-in house. Yotsuba is wrestling a classroom-sized tote full of paper crafts out the door, barely held together by willpower and tape. Fuutarou, hair tousled, is in the background reading “Beginner Cake Pops.”\]

**YOTSUBA** *(beam, energetic)*: Fuutarou! Don’t forget, today’s the Five-Star Festival Planning Committee! 

**FUUTAROU** *(weary, but smiling)*: You just made that up, didn’t you?

**YOTSUBA**: ...Let’s call it a “creative meeting.”

**YOTSUBA**: Good morning, Captain Nino, Bread Admiral Miku, Professor Ichika, and Queen Teacher Itsuki! 

**NINO** *(rolling eyes, mock salute)*: She’s gotten weirder.

**ICHIKA**: That’s the secret. She’s *always* been this weird.

\[The sisters sit together with snacks and drinks in front of them, sunlight filtering through green leaves. Each has a slightly bemused/skeptical look except Yotsuba, who is beaming.\]

**ITSUKI**: So, Yotsuba, what's the “super duper” emergency? Someone eat your last pudding again?

**YOTSUBA**: (earnest) Actually, yes, but that’s not why I called you!

**Miku**: ...Wasn’t me.

**Nino**: It's guilty until proven innocent in this family.

**YOTSUBA** *(intense, waving a crinkled flyer)*: The Shirohashi Shrine Festival is this weekend! Five years since we did the “Quintuplets’ Lucky Bell” together! I thought, what if this year, we made an actual plan? Booth, performance, relay race, Nakano Sisters come together, like, like... like Sentai Rangers!

**ICHIKA** *(teasing)*: Can I pick my color? Only if it’s not pink again.

**NINO**: Let me get this straight: you want us, all five, with our actual adult jobs and busy lives, to set up a tacky festival booth together because you love themed accessories?

**ITSUKI**: *sigh* It *is* nostalgic.

**YOTSUBA**: It’ll be fun! We’re all so serious now, I think we need a “grade-school” flashback. Besides, we haven’t had a proper sisterly disaster since... last month!

# Scene 3: Setting the Stakes: Festival of Five Begins

\[Yotsuba has a notepad. Nino snatches it, writing “No embarrassing costumes.” Itsuki hovers, suggesting “educational quizzes.” Ichika slips in “romantic fortune telling?” Miku quietly writes “avoid Nino’s scary face bread.” The dialogue overlaps, forming a heap of comic speech bubbles.\]

**ICHIKA**: Let’s actually assign roles. Otherwise we end up with five types of equally burnt takoyaki.

**NINO**: As long as I’m in charge of decor. Miku, kitchen duty.

**MIKU** *(muffled)*: …Someone check the fire extinguisher.

**YOTSUBA**: Let’s make a promise: This time, we do something as Nakano Quintuplets, the grown-up edition! Even if we’re “adults,” we can still have fun… and probably embarrass ourselves.

**Sisters** *(in unison, rolling eyes but grinning)*: *You* mean embarrass *us*.

**ITSUKI**: *serious, but fond* Remember—our mother always said, “Joy, anger, love, laughter, we share it in fifths.”

**ICHIKA**: Then what about all the trouble Yotsuba brings? Is that also shared?

**YOTSUBA** *(confident, thumb up)*: Trouble comes with extra toppings!

\[Wide view, sunset, the group scatters, each with a plan in mind. Miku plotting recipes, Nino critiquing color swatches, Ichika on a video call, Itsuki reviewing festival trivia, Yotsuba in the center, satisfied.\]

For the last 5 weeks or so my nausea has been something fierce. I’ve been somewhat managing the food but the worst part is that I can’t seem to drink more than a few sips of anything, with or without food. I’ve tried everything I can think of- tap water, filtered water, lemon water, bottled still water, sparkling water, alkaline bottled water, sparkling water with flavor and sugar/sweetener, liquid IV, several types of ginger ale and ginger teas, fruit juices, sodas, coffees/lattes, lemonade… literally everything and at all different temperatures too. Nothing is working. 

I haven’t been peeing much because I’ve barely been drinking 30 oz everyday although my OB recommended I aim for around 100 oz a day. I can tell my mental health is already starting to deteriorate a bit without enough fluid. I’m scared I’m going to get kidney issues or even cause harm to my baby. 

Does anyone have any suggestions that I haven’t tried yet? It feels like my only option now is to go to an ER and tell them I’m pregnant and dehydrated and hope they’ll give me an IV.

It appears that almost all proven sleep medications (with the exception of melatonin agonists and perhaps orexin antagonists) are at least tentatively associated with an increased risk of dementia, falls, and other aliments. Yet stimulants one may use to mitigate the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation appear to lack such associations.

I'll run through some key findings so we're all on the same page:

The only examples void of these associations but still possessing proven efficacy for insomnia (in some populations) are melatonin and melatonin agonists. I'm not counting probably innocuous sleep 'supplements' like magnesium and l-theanine because their acute efficacy probably pales in comparison to knockout pills like zolpidem and trazodone. 

However, when we look at the other side of the pharmacological coin - to drug wakefulness and or otherwise disguise cognitive impairment from sleep deprivation -, things appear much more favourable.

Modafinil, the prototypical eugeroic, has not turned up dementia concerns (though there isn't much evidence in any direction). It's also efficacious in improving quality of life for those who are effectively chronically sleep deprived (such as narcoleptics and OSA patients).

Amphetamine and methlyphenidate aren't associated with increased risks for dementia in ADHD,[ although there is an elevated risk inherent to ADHD to begin with.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810766) They are [associated with an increased risk of parkinsonism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7784516/), though by an absolute percentage of 1%. 

Caffeine is ridiculously innocuous when consumed at moderate (100-300mg) dosages through coffee and tea. It's also associated with a decreased risk of dementia and parkinsonism, though this is of course not suggestive of causation. 

This evidence is of course not causal, but it at least tenatively suggests that drugging wakefulness, or disguising the negative effects of poor sleep, may be safer than actively trying to drug sleep. I imagine this runs counter to most people's intuitions. It instinctively **feels** worse to down a cup of coffee while sleep deprived then it does to prevent sleep deprivation in the first place with an occasional sleeping pill. 

Not trying to make a point, just thought I would share in case others might find this interesting.

They said the rooms come with a bed, mattress, pillow, desk, chair, closet, and lighting, and that students can bring things like an electric kettle, hair dryer, iron, or heating pad without being charged extra for electricity. For food, they said the day starts with coffee and cookies, then there’s a full lunch buffet  around 10 in the morning, and dinner happens at 7 with both veg and non-veg options. Apparently there’s also some kind of monthly themed feast party for all the students. Is any of this even close to true? I’d love to hear what the actual setup is from someone who’s lived there.",3,1754201872.0,Harvard,7,1.0,False
