1jfjz6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jfjz6y/update_my_husband_32m_revealed_to_me_30f_that_he/,Update - My husband (32M) revealed to me (30F) that he may want to have children someday‚Ä¶,"Hi I‚Äôm back! A lot of you commented on my post so I figured I owed everyone an update. TLDR at bottom if you don‚Äôt want to read through whole recap of our follow up.

So it was a couple days after the first post that I was finally able to sit him down for a follow up conversation. I really appreciate everyone who gave me advice going into this, it really helped me figure out the direction I wanted to go in.

We had just had our morning coffees, mood was good so I asked him if he was in a headspace for a big conversation. Of course he essentially said ‚Äúwell now you‚Äôve got to tell me anyways otherwise I‚Äôll wonder‚Äù. 

I told him I wanted to talk more about his stance on children and if that is something he feels he needs, and I want to make sure we‚Äôre still on the same page.

You guys, the way he looked at me so shocked and asked ‚Äúwhere is this coming from‚Äù? Like we hadn‚Äôt just had a HUGE convo about birth control a couple days prior. I was stunned üòÖ

I explained that his reasoning, not the fact that he didn‚Äôt want to get the vasectomy, made me nervous that he does want to have kids someday. I told him the phrase ‚Äúalways envisioned myself having kids‚Äù is what really got to me and made me the most anxious.

He grabbed my hand and immediately apologized for the way he said that. He explained that yes he always thought that maybe he would have a kid or 2 growing up, but that isn‚Äôt his dream in life per se. He also explained that the world is not one he would currently even want to raise a child in.

Well I followed that up if with hypothetically all the conditions were right (world gets better, our finances are better, ect) if he thought that would increase from ‚Äúwould be nice‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to have it‚Äù? Also took this moment to reiterate that I am not having children, so if he thinks that it‚Äôs something he *actually* wants, we need to have a bigger discussion.

He took a moment to think, and told me he didn‚Äôt ever think he would need to have children. He does still maintain that it‚Äôs a nice idea, but that it‚Äôs really nothing more than a nice a thought. 
He also said he would not want to raise a family with anyone but me, so if we‚Äôre not having kids then he‚Äôs not having kids. 

I guess a lot of you in the comments called it. He‚Äôs fine not having kids, I panicked and didn‚Äôt ask him to elaborate. However he does agree that choice of words did make it seem like he could have changed his mind.

Soooo we‚Äôre fine, everything‚Äôs fine ü§ó. We do still need to figure out a new birth control and whatnot (thank you to everyone who threw in some more suggestions for both me and hubs to look into) but I am just so glad that my wonderful husband is still on the same page with me.

TLDR - The way my husband reacted to the mention of a vasectomy freaked me out because I don‚Äôt want to have kids. We had a follow up convo and we are still on the same page about not having kids. Whew!",1,1742458284.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

AITA?","Ok I'm kind of at a loss of what to do here and i need some advice and guidance.  Buckle up this is kind of long and I'm so stressed out by this situation so my editing skills are not working at full capacity. 

So I (37) just closed on an apartment which my parents were gracious enough to help me get with their credit scores,  and I did this to get out of a frankly abusive and toxic living situation with an ex who I had become stuck living with while trying to get funds together to leave.  On march 3rd i officially became the owner of my own studio apartment (yay go me!) And was able to leave and breath a sigh of relief for the first time in a long time.  My ex used to scream at new and get incredibly heated and by the time I left was starting to do things that initially felt were initial attempts at physical intimidation, like squaring up to me  and getting close to my face and the like. (Relevant, this is some context that will become clearer later.) 

So having been able to relax for the first time in forever,  I have been settling in and getting unpacked and playing that tedious game we have all played at one time or another of ""What have i still left at my ex's and can I have it back please (no dude I'm not not trying to get back together)"". So Friday afternoon one of my cats managed to slip out the door as I came back with a coffee, and in the process knocked the cup over when I set it down on the floor of my back stairwell to grab him.  I have 2 therapy cats,  who are both sweet affectionate and quiet little tuxedo goblins and love more than my own life.  As soon as I got the offending gremlin back inside I went to clean up as much of the spill as I could,  and i guess,  i didn't realize how much had dripped down on the landing below apparently,  because a few hours late I got a knock on my door from my new downstairs neighbor. He scared the absolute crap out of me because i wasnt expecting any knock on my door,  and upon opening the door i find this giant dude in my doorway decked head to toe in cubs gear who is a total stranger to me.  He turns out to be the resident of the unit directly below mine and had popped up to say hi and let me know about the spill and asking me to be mindful going forward.  Absolutely mortified,  I couldn't apologize enough,  we introduced ourselves and talked briefly about the building (a nice quiet little condo association in a cool older building in a major city with about 100 units mostly 30s-50s and i don't think anybody has kids that I've seen yet but I could be wrong) and he shared his experiences so far living here. 


This guy,  I'm going to call him Brad, says it's a great building and everyone is pretty cool,  mentions he's been recovering from shoulder surgery,  and just asks me to be careful because Luke,  being a big city,  trash and souls can attract rats and pests really sickly.  I've lived in apartments all my life all I'm very familiar,  and one again apologized profusely and offered to come clean it up more extensively for him (like I don't want this guy hurting himself after he surgery he's just had to endure over a spill my cat caused)  and he waves me off saying it's already taken care of and he's just letting me know. We talked for a little bit more and I honestly had thought this was a pretty pleasant little neighborly interaction,  even mentioning as much to my mom when I talked to her later.


One of the things this guy mentioned about his experience at this building so far was he felt like the walls were super thin and that he could hear everything from his neighbors.  I expressed that I was actually kind of surprised at how well insulated my unit seemed compared to previous living situations,  because I couldn't hear anything.  I asked him to let me know if I ever made excessive noise that bothered him,  because while I'm kind of a quiet homebody I am also a total night owl and have been kind of on an opposite schedule lately.  But since that's not a new habit of mine I have always taken great care to not be loud,  such as low volume on TV if I'm watching something late at night,  and my  rinkydink little computer speakers don't get that loud to begin with. 

It's almost a personal anxiety for me trying to keep quiet so as not to bother my neighbors ever with my night owl habits,  and in 20 odd years of renting I've never once had a noise complaint from any neighbors at all which I'm kind of proud of which is probably a bit silly. Anyway,  Brad had also waived this off saying he could only occasionally hear my cats chase each other but otherwise he seemed to indicate he hadn't had any problems so far. 

So I went on my merry way and thought nothing more off this seemingly nice and pleasant little interaction and that night and I thought nothing of it when i was up most of the night sewing to finish an art project and watching quiet YouTube documentaries on my computer.  Well Sunday afternoonmy parents were over to visit and see the place and we were sitting in my living room talking and I heard some raised voices from another unit.  

Initially I thought someone was watching football (not a football person obviously I don't know if it's even the season for it or not) or like in the phone with someone until I heard the voice say something about a puppy. I remember Brad had mentioned he had a young little dog so I was wondering if it was him yelling and what about.  It didn't occur to me that this guy was yelling at me possibly because I wasn't doing anything,  we were literally sitting in my living room talking at a normal volume at 2pm and I was folding laundry while talking to my parents.  

But when the raised voice didn't stop, I  asked my mom ""do you think he's talking to us?"" Cos I started feeling like he was.  Being 2pm on a Sunday afternoon,  and given we weren't doing anything that would seem to be loud or bothersome to anyone else I was pretty confused why he'd be talking to us,  which my mom agreed saying ""to us? Whatever for?"" And to kind of test that she stamped her heel down twice like she was knocking and waited. In response to which we heard a string of profanity come from him and then complaining that was hard to understand beyond the odd cussing that was loud enough to hear through the floor.  But since we weren't doing anything crazy and being literally the middle of the day we ignored it and then went out to dinner. There was no note on my door or anything when i got back note did i see the guy and thought nothing further of that weird little interaction. 


I was up rather late again that night, finishing that project still and one again watching documentaries on YouTube on my computer.  I don't think my volume got higher than 5 and I couldn't myself really hear it when the hvac fan kicked on or if I was more than a a few feet away from my computer. (I checked this extensively). I went to bed finally around 4 falling asleep to an audiobook on my computer that again was so quiet that when the hvac can kicked on you couldn't hear anything,  and definitely couldn't have heard unless you were directly in my unit with your head next to my computer speaker like i was.  

At 5am I was startled awake by my cats claws digging into me as he was scared awake by loud aggressive shouting coming from Brad in the unit below. Groggy and trying to get my bearings,  I realized he was screaming at ME. LITERALLY SCREAMING about how I'm ""a crackhead"" and that I don't belong there,  because he's a home owner and my parents bought this place for me (naw buddy I'm the legal owner on the title and documents) that my ""asshole cats and fucking tv"" were keeping him up, (cats had been asleep in bed with me,  one on my chest and the other hugging my leg), and i don't even have my TV set up yet,  just my computer and the speaker which was on my bed and as I mentioned,  so quiet there's no possible way i can find he could have been hearing that) and other similarly unsettling and rude comments. 

This went on for about 15 minutes ending with him threatening to call the condo association or hoa or whatever it is exactly that this building has,  and i struggled to get back to sleep after that because I kept expecting him to come up banging on the door.  I messaged my mom immediately kind of in shock because I was caught in a panic,  half asleep,  and didn't know what to do.  Like the glaswegian in me wanted to yell back ""keep it down dude since of us are trying to sleep""  but like I just got out of a situation with an aggressive yelly partner so the ptsd took over and I just froze.  I'm pretty sure the whole building heard this guy's screaming.

When she finally woke up and saw it she told me to call the condo association to tell them what had happened and ask them for info which i did. My mom is understandably now freaked out that I've landed in a situation where there's still an aggro dude yelling at me and making my living situation hostile and difficult.  Because she's my cosigner and also technically on the title with me she called as well asking for information about how i should proceed. (Which i am so grateful she did because I value her experience with dealing with condo boards and stuff like this,  I've never dealt with it before and I'm pretty non confrontational as I have the people pleasing  disease and I am second guessing myself that I am overstepping or something here.  

The condo management company were really nice and they gave me quite a lot of information about my options, and seemed pretty sympathetic, (but who knows I thought this dude was being nice but now I have an uneasy feeling he was trying to intimidate me and his real motivation for introducing himself was to get on my case about noise and we'll here we are). They asked if I wanted to file a complaint myself and I said i was unsure and I'd let them know in a day or two because I'm not trying to be a problem right out of the gate here or make any enemies,  I really don't want to take that step unless I absolutely have to but this dude is giving me so much anxiety it's affecting my life. The management company asked me to email all that I'd told them so they could have it in writing, documenting the incident my parents had witnessed,  the profanity alarm id had at 5am and any future incidents that occur and that they'd talk to this guy about the screaming thing. I did send the email and everything too so they said they'd make sure the board gets all this if Brad tries to make a complaint. 

That afternoon I went and bought a huge area rug and have been looking at sound insulation options to absorb any possible noises this guy might be hearing, but like my TV wasn't on and my cats were asleep in bed with me as was I so I don't know how much quieter I can be than UNCONSCIOUS. So yeah if anyone had any recommendations for that or suggestions of things i can do quickly and inexpensively to help on that front please let me know.  My friend Maggie (also a fake name) came over to help me carry the rug in and lay it down and also kind of to be a witness in case the noise of that set Brad off. Again I came home to no note on my door or anything,  nothing like any kind of neighborly ""hey just to let you know"" kind of anything for me.  Maggie introduced me to the first few episodes of Severance (immediately hooked) and we spent a couple of hours catching up and just sitting and sharing memes back and forth talking in a quiet whisper (Maggie's words) with a quiet chuckle here or there.

We were trying to listen for any outbursts from Brad, and at 11pm just a wed given up and Maggie was leaving,  we were literally walking out the door and we hear Brad imitating us and fake laughing in a mocking tone and once again he screams how I don't belong here and I better not keep him up with my ""crackhead shit"" because some of us have jobs. B R U H.

Maggie had literally just been making fun of me telling me i had jumped the gun thinking this guy was going to blow up again tonight because we hadn't heard anything yet when she was interrupted by this insanity. Again I didn't know what to do,  but I walked Maggie out of the building and was really unsettled by the whole thing and struggled to sleep.  I kept worrying anytime the cats so much as twitched in their sleep whether he hear it or the slightest noise of me setting a glass of water down on the table. 

Now this is literally keeping me awake.  I of course sent a followup email detailing this and at my mom's and Maggie's suggestion I asked more about the complaints process and how to resists a formal complaint about this guy,  because this is giving me so much anxiety and I'm having flashbacks of arguments with my ex and other traumatic events in my past. I have therapy later in the morning so I will hopefully be able to figure some of that out with my therapist but I don't know what else to do here.  I'm kind of afraid to leave my apartment in car this guy comes out and tried to get confrontational.  Especially now that I find he's filled a formal complaint about the imaginary noise he thinks I'm making (with added lie about how I am apparently just flinging trash all over the back stairwells and gangway, which I'm not. ) I've been here barely 2 weeks,  I literally don't know how someone goes from zero to full on screaming profanity through the floor at someone and while part of me wonders if this guy has never lived in an apartment building ever before,  this is stressing me out.  My mom got me ring doorbells for my front and back door which I set up immediately,  and I've set up my cat camera to record constantly in hopes of picking up this guy if he has another outburst.  I also am kind of concerned and confused how he knows my parents were involved in the buying process at all when I introduced myself as the new owner of my unit and never mentioned them.  Not that it matters anyway,  but like It feels like some weird attempt to force a hierarchy or something where he'd thinks he's superior to me because he owns his unit where he doesn't believe I own mine at all. And it feels ridiculous forcing a dumb hierarchy anyway because we both have identical units, exact same size and layout, etc.


I've literally never had a noise complaint ever before this and have always tried to maintain really positive relationships with the people living in my community and especially with neighbors and this guy has escalated this quickly in less than 14 days. I haven't even slept in the place every night so unless I'm hosting raves while clog dancing in my sleep or the cats are doing so,  I'm completely at a loss.  so people of reddit,  ...... help? AITA?

It occurred at my local library, which I frequently go to study or eat/drink something at the cafeteria. 

I was just waiting for my coffee, minding my own business when a ÏïÑÍ∞ÄÏî® (young lady) starts visibly staring at me with ""piercing eyes"". Haha I don't care about being stared at, as I lived here for a super long time... blah, blah... 

From my experiences with ÏïÑÏ§åÎßà (ajumma) or ÏïÑÏ†ÄÏî® (ajussi) I just ignore it or if it reaches that ""piercing eyes"" tier... I tend to either say hi or nod and leave. 

But today, this young lady, probably in her late 20's, reached that tier. So I just said hi and walked  away when I got my coffee. That's when the lady got my attention by saying ""Ïó¨Í∏∞ÏòàÏöî"" (over here) spoke to me in Korean and ask me if I spoke Korean... which I said yes. 

Then she asked me if I knew her. I responded with no. And this is the good part... the lady then ask me why I said hello. I simply told her because you were looking at me. I left right after this without even turning my back. 

Anyways, I don't really care about why she got all defensive about being caught, but why even try calling me out? Lol

	Chapter 1: The mundane¬†



Hearing the chime of the clock, the sizzling of the oil in the pan, and smelling the bacon that was cooking to the perfect crispness, I sit up from my bed. While getting up, I hear my wife humming along with the radio in the living room as she makes breakfast.

I get up and slowly walk to the bedroom door. As I walk into the hallway, I see the calendar. It was the 17th of June.

‚ÄúJust a normal day,‚Äù I mumbled.

I smell the morning coffee my wife makes for me, and as I walk down the stairs, I see my wife happily cooking and carefully preparing my meal.

I don't understand why she's so jolly all the time. There's nothing special to be happy about, and yet she‚Äôs so happy to make the same meal every day.

As I was thinking that, my wife noticed me.

‚ÄúOh, honey, you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù she beamed. ‚ÄúI just finished making breakfast. Quick, let's eat before it gets cold,‚Äù she said with that grin.

I quickly walked to the kitchen table and sat down at the same one I bought ten years ago. Looking at the weathered wood reminded me of how many times we had used it.

My wife placed my plate in front of me‚Äîthe usual eggs, bacon, and sausage, the same meal she made every day. I started eating and sipping my coffee as she sat down across from me and began rambling about her garden. I never understood why. She would always tell me, ‚ÄúLook at these flowers; their colors are so beautiful,‚Äù always saying it with a smile.

Others always say that her smile is so colorful, but I don't see it anymore. I‚Äôm sure I saw it before, but now it‚Äôs just a smile. I don't see why her smile is so special or why she's so infatuated with those flowers. She acts as if they are her whole world. When one of them withers, she cries for days, as if a pet had just died.

I try to comfort her, but I don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs so upset over something so insignificant.

Then I realized that it was almost time for work. I stood up, walked to the kitchen, and placed my plate in the sink. As I was walking out, my wife called me, and I stopped. She grabbed my tie and fixed it.

She does this every day. Even when I get it right, she always checks my tie and inspects my suit. When we were first married, I thought it was cute, but she has done it every day for ten years. I don‚Äôt know why she still does it, yet she looks so happy while doing it. Even when I‚Äôm late, she doesn‚Äôt skip it.

Afterward, she gives me a kiss on the cheek. I remember when she first did this‚ÄîI would blush so much. But we have done it so many times that I don‚Äôt really feel anything from it anymore. It‚Äôs just become normal.

I turned to the door, said goodbye to my wife, and walked down my house‚Äôs path. As always, I passed by my wife‚Äôs garden, filled with her signature flowers and the hard work she put into it. I continued walking.

I opened the garage door and got into my car. As I started the engine, I saw my wife prepping her gardening equipment. When I began backing out, she gave me another smile and waved.

I drove away on the same road I had taken for the past eight years, the same turns, I drove past many familiar places that I loved but I didn't have a hit of joy looking at them, the restaurant I used to enjoy blurred past, just another fixture in the routine, the whole world just felt so dull all the colors toned down it felt so dull as if all the color in the places i loved had just been replaced by a dull gray color, then I saw my office as gloomy as ever.

I walked into the gray building, past the boring receptionist, and into the old clunky elevator. Inside, the fluorescent lights shone over the dull cubicles. I walked to my desk, glancing at my junior‚Äôs cubicle. Compared to the grayness of everything else, his was filled with color‚Äîstickers, photos from places he had been. I must have been staring too long because he noticed me and greeted me.

‚ÄúMorning, sir!‚Äù he said with an energetic voice. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right on time, just like always. To be expected from you, sir!‚Äù He smiled.

‚ÄúMorning to you too, Sam. Did you finish the report I asked for?‚Äù I said in a monotone voice.

Sam quickly started going through his file cabinet. After scrambling for a bit, he pulled out the report and handed it to me. I nodded toward him and left, walking to my cubicle. From there, I started my work‚Äîa 9-to-5 routine, just typing away at statistical data and customer request notices. I had been doing this for the last eight years. Even when I first started, I was doing the same thing I do now.

At lunch, Sam came up to me and handed me an invitation to a coworker‚Äôs birthday party. He even asked me to invite my wife. I took the letter, shoved it into my bag, and told him I‚Äôd consider it. He looked happy that I had accepted the invite, I used to love going to parties but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt go. It was a waste of time.I mean why should I?¬†

The eight hours passed like nothing, and as I was preparing to head home, I overheard Sam and another coworker talking about going to a bar. I hated alcohol. I never found it enjoyable, and I only saw it as an annoyance when someone brought it to an event. In the end, everyone would reek of alcohol and end up drunk on the ground.

I finished packing up and clocked out for the day. As I was leaving, Sam called out, ‚ÄúAh, sir! Do you want to have a drink or grab something to eat? My treat!‚Äù

I declined his offer and told him to go without me. Then I walked to the parking lot and drove home.

Now at night, the shop lights illuminated the road as I drove. A nagging feeling crept in, like I had forgotten something, but I shrugged it off and kept driving down the street.

I turned the corner and saw my neighborhood. At the front gate, I greeted the guard before driving down the road to my house. As I pulled into the garage, I noticed that my wife had hung something up. I couldn't quite make out what it was‚ÄîI could only see a silhouette. It looked like a balloon.

I stepped out of my car and approached the door. When I opened it, I saw her scrambling to move a box of decorations. The moment she noticed me, she panicked and ran to the kitchen. I stared around for a bit and She quickly came back with a cake that readed:

**Happy Birthday**

‚ÄúHappy Birthday, honey! I know you're not the type to celebrate these things, but I was really sad the past few years because you always skipped your birthdays and rejected my gifts. So please, at least this time, let‚Äôs celebrate,‚Äù she said with a smile.

I was surprised. I had completely forgotten it was my birthday. But even knowing this, I felt nothing. My birthday wasn‚Äôt special‚Äînot to me, I have so many happy memories with my family but now that it‚Äôs my birthday it just feels like just another day. But i don't remember when did it become just another day?, My expression didn‚Äôt change. I simply said, ""Oh. Right,"" I said flatly. and walked to the kitchen.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù I asked, still having my monotone voice.

She opened her mouth as if she was going to say something but stopped and just gave a worried look before forcing a small, awkward smile. She placed the cake on the countertop and then set my plate on the table. It was my favorite dish‚Äîspaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was red and fresh, the meatballs had a perfect, juicy color.

But when I took a bite, I immediately knew. It was my mother‚Äôs signature dish.

It was good. I knew it was good. But still, I felt nothing. No satisfaction, no warmth, not even nostalgia. Just another meal, another day, the same as the last. I lifted another forkful to my mouth, chewing slowly.

Even though this was my favorite meal, I don't know why, why I didn't feel anything, it just felt‚Ä¶ gray. After dinner I hugged my wife and thanked her and I just went to bed after.

I usually count from when the pump activates the second time, for the actual extraction. 


I have an ECM Mechanica VI Slim, which has a built in preinfusion setting that can be activated. If activated the pump will run for 3-4s and after 1-2s pause start again until turned off. 


I tend to pull shots between 30-35s (to account for the 5-7s built in preinfusion), but sometimes the coffee will flow quite quickly. For example today I stopped at 26s because I already hit a 1:2,5 ratio. I usually do small adjustments to the grinder if this happens, but I also thought the shot/cappuccino was very tasty even though realistically the shot length was quite short. 


I guess one of the questions I have is if preinfusion helps offset the effect of beans changing in a hopper as I do tend to have 5+s variances in my extraction times, but am rarely disappointed in my coffee. I tend to have the beans in the hopper for 3-4days max.

# Will Best Buy Be Open on Thanksgiving?

1jfjj9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dental_Art_Clinic/comments/1jfjj9y/the_secret_to_an_instantly_better_smile_without/,The Secret to an Instantly Better Smile (Without Veneers),"Ever wondered how to fix a small tooth chip or gap without going all-in on veneers? One popular solution in cosmetic dentistry is¬†[composite bonding](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/composite-bonding). It‚Äôs a quick, painless, and¬†**cost-effective alternative to**¬†[veneers¬†](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/veneers)that‚Äôs become¬†*super*¬†popular here in London. For those unfamiliar, composite bonding (aka¬†*dental bonding*) involves applying a tooth-colored resin to your teeth to repair minor flaws and enhance your smile‚Äôs appearance. The best part? It often only takes¬†**one visit**¬†to the dentist, so you can walk out with a refreshed smile in no time!

**What Makes Composite Bonding Awesome?**¬†Here are some key benefits that have Londoners raving about this treatment:

* **Quick Results (One-Visit Smile Upgrade):**¬†The whole process is usually done in a single appointment, often in under an hour. Perfect for busy schedules ‚Äì you could literally get a tooth fixed on your lunch break. Instant gratification!
* **Painless & Non-Invasive:**¬†No drills, no needles (in most cases). The dentist just lightly preps the tooth surface and adds the resin. It‚Äôs generally¬†**painless**, so if dental work makes you nervous, bonding is pretty stress-free. Plus, since there‚Äôs minimal to no enamel removal, your natural tooth stays intact.
* **Affordable Alternative to Veneers:**¬†Want the aesthetic boost of veneers but not the hefty price tag? Composite bonding is¬†**much more budget-friendly**. You get similar cosmetic improvements (covering discoloration, smoothing chips, closing small gaps) at a fraction of the cost of porcelain veneers.¬†**Bonus:**¬†It‚Äôs reversible, unlike veneers which permanently alter your teeth.
* **Fixes Chips, Gaps & Other Flaws:**¬†Bonding is super versatile. It can repair a chipped tooth, fill in a slight gap between teeth, mask small cracks or spots, and even make a slightly crooked tooth look straighter. It‚Äôs basically a cosmetic touch-up that can make your teeth look more even and bright.
* **Boosts Smile Aesthetics (and Confidence):**¬†By improving tooth shape and color, composite bonding can dramatically enhance your smile‚Äôs appearance. Many patients say it gives them a¬†**big confidence boost**¬†‚Äì you‚Äôll find yourself smiling more when you‚Äôre not worried about that one annoying chip or uneven tooth! üéâ

**Why**¬†***London***¬†**Loves Composite Bonding:**¬†Aside from the benefits above, composite bonding fits the London vibe perfectly. It‚Äôs¬†**quick, effective, and readily available**¬†at many cosmetic dental clinics here (including ours at¬†[Dental Art Implant Clinic](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/composite-bonding)). We‚Äôve seen first-hand how a bit of bonding can transform someone‚Äôs smile¬†*in one day*. In a city where everyone‚Äôs busy and quality matters, this treatment has become a go-to for a subtle but impactful smile makeover. And yes, it‚Äôs great for that tea or coffee staining habit ‚Äì bonding can cover up discoloration and give you a fresh start (just remember to still go easy on the lattes to keep it looking its best! üòâ).

**Let‚Äôs Chat!**¬†Have you had any experience with composite bonding or other cosmetic dental work in London?¬†**What do you think of it?**¬†If you‚Äôre curious or have questions about how composite bonding works, what it costs around here, or whether it‚Äôs the right fix for your teeth ‚Äì ask away in the comments! üí¨ As dental professionals, we‚Äôre happy to share honest advice and info. Whether you‚Äôre contemplating a minor tweak or just love learning about dental stuff, we‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.

I knew the job market was bad, but did not fully prepare myself for the task at hand. Even with covid it took me 4 months to find a new role.

Today I can breathe I sigh of relief as I received a full-time offer for a position I interviewed for back in early February. I applied on the company website with no referrals. The company also had a hiring freeze right after my final interview, but today the Director got the word that she would be able to add one more to the headcount and she called me immediately as we have continued to stay in touch. Though I have never tied my worth to my job it can still feel that you're not doing enough or a burden to others around you. I won't start until the end of April as I need to move back to my hometown in the Bay Area, so by the time I start I will have been 10 months unemployed.

I wish I could say it's $20K more than I was making, but I am making slightly more than I was on my previous base salary at $75K (hourly) this is with me negotiating and they were able to come up $5K with OT pay & commissions and what will be a tough market as I am going back to into staffing & recruiting for an agency, which I know many view negatively or have had fairly bad experiences and with this current economy. Yet I'm excited to be moving forward and the opportunity at hand.

I've dipped into savings, but am so privileged by the safety net I am afforded by my mom, in-laws, and my husband who is in a very stable role in corporate finance.

It really is such a slog to wake up every morning, make a coffee, and sit down for 5-6 hours of applications and simultaneously receive rejections. By month 3, this really was my full-time job. It can be so demoralizing. Please take care of your mental health. For me, it was finding my happy place 3x a week at my workout classes.

I asked the couple and they said It was ok if I didnt attend the mass, that maybe some other people wouldnt enter the mass either (for context, I live in Spain, here a lot of people are catholic but there are also a lot of people who have hard feelings towards the church, I would say that is because in the dictatorship that Spain had in the past the oficial religion was catholicism and the church still has a lot of privileges, like not paying taxes.

The screams, the scuffle, that unforgettable echo of gunfire bouncing off concrete walls. JFK‚Äôs motorcade rolling into an ambush that changed the course of history. Like a record scratched so deep it never plays right again, America‚Äôs psyche stayed jammed, repeating the question: Who really pulled the strings that day?

Most folks turn to the usual suspects‚ÄîOswald, the Mob, the CIA, maybe some Cuban exiles hopped up on their own brand of vengeance. But that‚Äôs too neat a package, way too small-time for something that big. The deeper you dig, the more you realize the players were global. This wasn‚Äôt just a Dallas job or a Miami job or a New Orleans job. It was bigger than that, man. It stretched across the ocean, weaving from D.C. to Tel Aviv, from Texas to the hush-hush labs in Dimona, from smoky Mafia hangouts to hidden CIA safe houses. The moment the bullet took JFK‚Äôs life, the trajectory of world power got realigned with surgical precision‚Äîlike someone tightened the screws from the shadows, then stepped back and let the new order bloom.

Thing is, Jack Kennedy had a style about him, a vibe that threatened to burn down the old ways. He talked about peace. He butted heads with generals. He told the CIA no. And big-time, he had a major beef with how Israel was cooking something dangerous out in the desert. The Dimona nuclear plant‚Äîhe pressed them for inspections, for transparency, for accountability. Kept sending letters, kept hounding them like a nosy landlord who wants inside your apartment to make sure you‚Äôre not trashing the place. People don‚Äôt always connect those dots, but they‚Äôre there, spelled out in memos and cables that most folks never read. And that friction between JFK and Israeli leadership, especially David Ben-Gurion and his prot√©g√© Shimon Peres, was no small thing. For Israel, nukes were the ticket to real survival‚Äîno more existential fear if you had that unstoppable button in your back pocket.

Now, the official story tries to flatten all that nuance. ‚ÄúLone gunman,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúMagic bullet,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúCase closed.‚Äù But behind the scenes, it was like a thousand voices shouted all at once: the intelligence services, the arms dealers, the political bigwigs, the men who pinned their entire future on a nuclear-armed Israel. Because if JFK lived, maybe that nuke program stalled out. Maybe Dimona got put on ice. Then guess who slides into the White House seat the minute Kennedy‚Äôs coffin leaves Dallas? Lyndon Baines Johnson, a cat whose stance on Israel flipped 180 degrees the second he took office. Suddenly, that hush-hush desert project was no longer a headache. LBJ basically gave them a silent nod, and so the nuclear genie crept out of the bottle without the old man in the Oval Office fussing about inspections.

It‚Äôs wild to think about how fast the pivot happened. One day, you have Kennedy writing stern letters to Ben-Gurion, and soon as LBJ gets sworn in, it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you worry about that desert site, fellas. We‚Äôre good.‚Äù And around the same time, over in Mossad‚Äôs headquarters, a man named Meir Amit took the reins. If you know your intelligence lore, you know Amit was a mastermind, the kind who could organize entire geopolitical chess matches before your coffee got cold. Under his watch, Israel ascended from just a scrappy underdog to a cunning shadow empire. He coordinated the kind of ops that made Bond movies look like kids‚Äô cartoons, from the Operation Plumbat scheme to acquire uranium surreptitiously, to the infiltration of every major capital worth infiltrating. The timing is more than curious: Amit rose to power mere months after JFK was out of the picture.

Then there‚Äôs the swirl of ghost companies, the labyrinth of fronts that intelligence agencies use to bankroll dirty business. Take Permindex, for instance, a Swiss-based outfit that‚Äôs popped up in multiple conspiracy theories pointing to European fascists, CIA side hustles, and yes, alleged Mossad associations. When you look at the board members, you see a tangle of names who are rumored to have financed pro-colonial mercenaries, anti-communist radicals, and yes, possibly the contract in Dallas. One of these cats is Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, a Zionist lawyer with deep intelligence ties. But that‚Äôs just a corner of a bigger canvas. If you dig deeper into the CIA and FBI archives‚Äîwhat little remains unredacted‚Äîthere are glimpses of something connecting them all, like someone wove a spiderweb that crossed oceans, then snipped the threads the moment the job was done.

George de Mohrenschildt is another puzzle piece that never quite fits in the official jigsaw. A rich aristocrat buddy of Lee Harvey Oswald, he seemed out of place in Oswald‚Äôs scruffy life. Why was a guy with connections to high-rolling oil magnates and clandestine networks chumming it up with a disillusioned ex-Marine? That alone sets off alarm bells. De Mohrenschildt told a few folks near the end of his life that he‚Äôd sniffed out the bigger plot, that he had a list of names locked away in his head, but he never spilled them all. Next thing you know, he‚Äôs found dead by ‚Äúsuicide,‚Äù shotgun to the head, just as an investigator was knocking on his door. Tragic coincidence or tidy cleanup? You be the judge.

And then you get into the labyrinth of James Jesus Angleton, the CIA‚Äôs paranoid poet of counterintelligence. Orchid hobbyist by day, relentless mole hunter by night, and the biggest champion of Israel inside Langley‚Äôs walls. This dude was so locked in with Mossad that they had a secret backchannel‚Äîsome called it ‚ÄúThe Connection‚Äù‚Äîwhich even the CIA‚Äôs own top brass didn‚Äôt fully grasp. Angleton‚Äôs job was to sniff out infiltration, to guard against Soviet moles. But ironically, he ended up giving Mossad a seat at the CIA‚Äôs dinner table, exchanging intelligence and covering for them whenever certain agendas overlapped. Post-assassination, a lot of documents that might have indicted or implicated certain Israeli angles mysteriously got buried, shredded, or labeled so sensitive that only a handful of eyes ever laid on them.

Meanwhile, out on the streets where the real game pieces shuffle, the Mafia was licking its wounds from Bobby Kennedy‚Äôs crackdown. The Kennedys had tried to clean up the rackets, shutting down lines of business that kept guys like Meyer Lansky and Santo Trafficante in furs and Cadillacs. Lansky, the big brain behind the mob‚Äôs global finances, had a thing for Israel, funneling money over there, forging relationships that were mutually beneficial. In exchange for donations and under-the-table deals, the Israeli government sometimes turned a blind eye to certain shady flows of cash. Post-JFK, the dynamic changed. The heat from the administration cooled off, and the CIA kept using mob muscle for their own off-the-books hits, especially in anti-Castro ops. But some folks, like Johnny Roselli, started whispering that their operation to kill Castro was hijacked, that the same skill set used to try to off the Cuban leader got twisted around to take out JFK. Who orchestrated the pivot? The rumor mills point in all sorts of directions, including that so-called ‚Äúthird party‚Äù that always remains unnamed - Tel Aviv. 

You can‚Äôt do the Dallas dance without mentioning Jack Ruby, the guy who stepped into the basement of the Dallas Police Department and pumped Lee Harvey Oswald full of bullets on live TV. Everyone pegged Ruby as some sleazy strip club owner with mob connections, but there was another side to him. He‚Äôd run guns to Israel in 1948, bragged about being super patriotic toward that newly formed state, had phone numbers in his notebook that went beyond just Mafiosi. Sure, he might‚Äôve been a patriot in his own eyes, but to the world, that story was overshadowed by the two shots he fired into Oswald. After that, the national conversation didn‚Äôt linger on Ruby‚Äôs background. They dismissed him as a hothead who wanted to avenge Kennedy. Then he got locked up, developed a sudden case of cancer that took him out quickly, and all the medical files or personal diaries that might have revealed deeper ties? They just floated away, never to be found in one piece.

And let‚Äôs not forget LBJ‚Äôs trajectory after that bloody day in Dallas. With the stroke of a pen, he ramped up arms shipments to Israel, set the stage for them to become a regional powerhouse. By ‚Äô67, when the Six-Day War blew up, Israel was loaded with American-made weapons. It turned into a lightning-fast conflict, one that reshaped borders and cemented Israel‚Äôs image as an indomitable regional force. But there‚Äôs a dark, seldom-discussed footnote: the USS Liberty incident. Israeli jets attacked an American signals intelligence ship in broad daylight, killing dozens of sailors. Officially, it was ‚Äúfriendly fire,‚Äù an accident in the fog of war. But those who survived, and many intelligence insiders, believed it was deliberate. The theory goes that Israel wanted no witnesses to their military maneuvers, or maybe they planned to blame the sinking on Egypt to drag the U.S. deeper into the conflict. LBJ himself called off rescue aircraft, letting the Liberty fend for itself. The cover story was hammered down real tight. Another coincidence in a decade overflowing with them?

Years pass, and the story of JFK‚Äôs assassination gets packaged into documentaries, books, and film dramatizations. Government panels spout the same sanitized lines. Then in the 1990s, thanks to public pressure, the CIA coughs up more of its files under the JFK Records Act. But guess what? Page after page of black lines where names should be. Redactions upon redactions. The biggest chunks of hidden data? Not about Cuba or Russia‚Äîno, they revolve around the Middle East. Israeli contacts, code names, references to nuclear agreements. One of the more intriguing glimpses came in the form of a partially declassified cable about Dimona, codenamed ‚ÄúJericho‚Äù in some references. It hinted that if Israel kept pushing the nuke program, it might ignite a genocide-level conflict. The rest of that cable remains blacked out, including references to how intense the standoff got between Kennedy and Ben-Gurion. You read that, and you start to wonder: if there was nothing to hide, why muzzle the text so aggressively?

Let‚Äôs sprinkle in a footnote about Dorothy Kilgallen, a famous journalist who teased that she was onto something big with the Oswald story. She hinted she‚Äôd found a link that mainstream media wasn‚Äôt ready to touch. Then she died of an apparent overdose, and her notes vanished. You see a pattern in how witnesses, investigators, or loose ends get ‚Äúcleaned up.‚Äù The mainstream chalks it up to rumor, coincidence, or the stress of living in the swirl of a national tragedy. But it keeps happening until the puzzle has more missing pieces than actual ones.

Fast forward into modern times, and we see politicians and spooks doubling down on controlling the narrative. Even after all these decades, thousands of JFK-related files remain locked up. Each time a release date approaches, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúnational security‚Äù reason to stall. Meanwhile, technology gets better. People talk about using AI to unredact documents, scanning them at frequencies that might reveal what‚Äôs behind the black ink. Could we finally see the real data? Or is that data long gone‚Äîshredded, burned, or buried in a vault that only a handful of people know about?

And so, the question lingers: why bury the Israeli angle if there‚Äôs no ‚Äúthere‚Äù there? Why is that particular thread so radioactive? Because, if you connect those dots‚ÄîKennedy‚Äôs hard stance on Dimona, Ben-Gurion‚Äôs fury, Peres‚Äôs hush-hush maneuvers, Angleton‚Äôs cozy arrangement with Mossad, plus LBJ‚Äôs unwavering post-assassination support‚Äîit forms a chain of coincidences that‚Äôs too big to ignore. Even if you aren‚Äôt blaming any single group for physically pulling the trigger, the aftermath sure looks like a prime piece of real estate for Israel and its allies. JFK gone, LBJ in, nuclear program free to bloom, and Israel‚Äôs intelligence apparatus stepping into a golden era. That‚Äôs a strong hand to play. And in global power games, results often matter more than who pulled the trigger.

To be clear, ""Israel wanted JFK dead."" Others argue it‚Äôs more of a subtle game‚Äîany number of factions might have been involved, from Texas oil men to Cuban exiles, and the Israel factor was just one piece in the plot. Or maybe the ""Tel Aviv connection"" was a tangential benefit, the root cause. In the smoky world of espionage, illusions pile on illusions. But if you suspect that the official story is half-baked, you better believe other angles exist, and that hush-hush nuclear project stands out as a prime motive that rarely gets front-page coverage.

People talk about ""anti-Semitism"" as a shield, too. The minute you mention Israel in the same sentence as a global conspiracy, someone‚Äôs bound to call you a bigot, and that‚Äôs a conversation-stopper. But if we‚Äôre analyzing a government‚Äôs intelligence operations‚Äîlike we would the CIA, MI6, or the KGB‚Äîwhy should Israel‚Äôs Mossad be off-limits? Legit critiques of a nation-state‚Äôs espionage have nothing to do with hating a particular ethnicity or faith. Sometimes that line gets blurred, intentionally or not, and it becomes a perfect tactic to hush uncomfortable questions. Because if you can label every critique as hateful, you don‚Äôt have to debate the details or produce the receipts.

So the game keeps running, half a century on, with new chapters added every decade. Look at Netanyahu in modern times, playing the hawk on security, forging alliances with American power brokers, championing an almost unstoppable defense posture. He wrote academic papers on counterterrorism that some say read like a Mossad greatest-hits manual. The echoes of the 1960s are still humming, shaping how Israel wields its defense strategies and how the U.S. interacts with a nuclear-armed ally in a volatile region. JFK might‚Äôve had a very different vision for that region. Maybe if he‚Äôd stayed alive, we‚Äôd see a different map, a different set of alliances, maybe even no Six-Day War or Yom Kippur War in the forms we know them. But that‚Äôs the big what-if.

And who benefits from the official story never changing? The CIA has never admitted wrongdoing in the assassination, the FBI keeps their stance, and mainstream media never pivoted from the Warren Commission‚Äôs line. They occasionally highlight the more ""acceptable"" conspiracies‚Äîthe Mafia, the anti-Castro exiles. But mention Dimona or Mossad and watch how quick the conversation goes cold. Not many institutions want to open that can of worms. When you combine the intelligence relationships, the nuclear hush money, the fear of global backlash, and the swirl of post-WWII sympathies that were sky-high in the 1960s, you get a big political risk for anyone even flirting with the idea that Tel Aviv or those connected to it had a seat at the table of JFK‚Äôs downfall.

So we shuffle on. Another decade, another partial declassification. Another cable with 80 percent black ink, 20 percent context. Another batch of microfilm that‚Äôs ‚Äúmissing.‚Äù Meanwhile, the old players are gone, taking their secrets to the grave. LBJ died a long time ago. Meir Amit is gone. Angleton‚Äôs dusty records have likely been sanitized a dozen times over. They no longer have to worry about loose-lipped staffers or whistleblowers; time is the perfect accomplice. If there‚Äôs any evidence floating around in a private attic or locked in a Swiss deposit box, it‚Äôll probably remain hidden until it rots. The fewer living witnesses, the easier it is to seal the narrative behind a facade of ""national security"" or ""anti-hate"" disclaimers.

That‚Äôs the game: you brand any uncomfortable digging as ""conspiracy,"" you attach that label to unhinged nonsense, you smear it with hateful overtones, and the average person backs off. They don‚Äôt want to be associated with paranoid rants or bigotry. Meanwhile, the actual threads remain un-pulled, the actual puzzle unsolved. It‚Äôs the ultimate intelligence maneuver: controlling the narrative by making certain areas taboo. For decades, researchers who tried to follow the Israeli link in the JFK story got blacklisted or ridiculed, their reputations tarnished. They got ""othered"" in academic circles, forced to the fringes. Because, hey, nobody wants to stand with the ""cranks"" or get labeled anti-Israel.

But if you stand on the outside looking in, it‚Äôs kind of obvious. The biggest beneficiary of Kennedy‚Äôs abrupt exit was Lyndon Johnson. Another big beneficiary was the blossoming of the Israeli nuclear project. The intelligence networks that wanted him gone certainly had the means to orchestrate a hit‚Äîparticularly if they piggybacked on the CIA-Mafia Castro plots. The government agencies that gave cover had plenty of synergy with Mossad. And the media machine that shaped public opinion had its strings pulled by Operation Mockingbird, ensuring the narrative stayed palatable: a confused ex-Marine with communist sympathies killed the President, case closed.

Fifty, sixty years on, we‚Äôre left with a swirling mixture of half-truths, unverified documents, plausible deniability, and a handful of dead bodies that might‚Äôve known too much. Some folks like to imagine that one day, a digital crusader will crack open the CIA‚Äôs files or that some dusty archive in Israel might reveal a gem that ties everything together. But power tends to protect itself. The odds that a bulletproof piece of evidence surfaces? Slim to none. Even if it did, folks with vested interests might bury it deeper. Because acknowledging that the official story is incomplete, that a close U.S. ally might‚Äôve been entwined in the biggest political murder of modern American history, would be cataclysmic for the official narrative. Nations have gone to war over less.

So we tell the story in half-whispers, in these side alleys of the historical conversation, passing around the puzzle pieces. People wonder if it‚Äôs an urban myth, or maybe just another paranoid delusion in a country that loves conspiracies. But sometimes conspiracies are real. Watergate was real. MKUltra was real. The fact that the CIA teamed up with the Mob to kill Castro was real. So is it really so far-fetched to consider that the apparatus built for one political assassination pivoted to another target, especially if that target threatened a multi-billion dollar nuclear project on the other side of the world?

In the end, the question of ""Did Israel play a role in JFK‚Äôs assassination?"" remains in that twilight zone of speculation, partly because so many of the leads are overshadowed by bigger, more convenient culprits. But each time you read about how quickly U.S.-Israel relations warmed under LBJ, or how firmly the nuclear program advanced, or how Mossad got carte blanche to operate in ways that would have made JFK‚Äôs skin crawl, you wonder if these events are random or if they‚Äôre footprints of a carefully orchestrated takeover. At the intersection of intelligence services, organized crime, and big-time politics, truth gets murky.

And maybe that‚Äôs the real tragedy: we‚Äôll never know for sure, because the people who do know kept it locked behind layers of secrecy, painting over the story with misdirection so cunning you almost have to admire it. And if you push too hard or talk too loud, you get dismissed or discredited. That‚Äôs how it goes in this game. Meanwhile, JFK‚Äôs face still beams from old footage, locked in a moment of hope and possibility that ended with a bullet on November 22, 1963. The official pages of history say Oswald acted alone. But if you pay attention, if you check who profited, who expanded their power, who got their nuclear dreams realized, you might decide the web of conspirators was larger, maybe transatlantic, with a silent nod from Tel Aviv. And you might see the events after the assassination‚Äîespecially the transformation in U.S.-Israel policy‚Äîas the biggest clue of all.

So yeah, next time someone swears there‚Äôs no Israeli angle, that it‚Äôs all just wild speculation, you could ask, ""Then why hide so many documents? Why bury the cables referencing Dimona? Why label so many Israeli names in the JFK files as top secret?"" Maybe it‚Äôs standard policy, or maybe it‚Äôs a fear that unveiling those threads would upend alliances. One thing‚Äôs certain: from the day that last shot rang out in Dealey Plaza, the world changed. A new era dawned, in which certain projects went unchallenged, certain alliances forged deeper ties, and certain secrets got locked behind a fortress of national security. And that fortress stands to this day, guarded by gatekeepers who‚Äôd prefer that the hidden chapters of that story never see the light.",18,1742454378.0,conspiracy,1,0.95,False

1jfizu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jfizu1/my_ex_refused_to_set_boundaries_with_a_girl_who/,my ex refused to set boundaries with a girl who wanted him,"okay. this girl makes me lose my mind. so, my now-ex-boyfriend has this girl in his school who was always just.... there. not his best friend, not someone particularly important in his life, just there. at first, i didn't think too much of her. me and my ex were in a long distance relationship but we know each other in real life since we used to go to the same school. i never knew this girl is that close to him, i started noticing how she was always around him (in school, in call, in game, everywhere); she'd sit next to him, laugh too hard at his jokes, touch him in ways that made him uncomfortable (which he admitted but did nothing about), and just acted way too familiar. and then things escalated.

december 2024 - one day, i'm hanging out with my ex and two other friends. we're just chilling, talking, when out of nowhere, this girl GIGGLES and says that she has a crush on my boyfriend. in front of me. she says it so casually like it's small talk. and i was just sitting there, blinking, trying to process if i really just heard that. surely, this girl isn't bold enough to confess her feelings for my ex. the room goes silent and you know what she says next? ""i humbly apologize."" as if she just spilled coffee on my shirt. not, ""oh, that was inappropriate, i'm sorry"" or ""i didn't mean to overstep."" no. she 'humbly apologizes.' and my ex partner? who wanted to keep the peace? he says nothing. i felt mocked. i was being placed in a position where my loved one must choose between maintaining the peace and protecting me.... only to find out that i wasn't the preferred option.

january 2025 - i decided to confront this girl and my ex in our friend group chat, i found out from his other friends that my ex and her kept holding hands at school. she'd also smother his hand while he naps and other disgusting stuff. they told me that they intended not to tell me about it so things wouldn't escalate more, welp. even worse is that she's aware of our relationship; her friends confronted her to stop, all she said was ""so what?"" after that, she apologizes to me privately and begged me for forgiveness - but not for the confession. no, she only apologizes for 'being too close' to my ex. and guess what? she didn't stop.

\- she kept touching him. he admitted it made him uncomfortable, still didn't tell her to stop.

\- she made an animation meme featuring herself, my ex, and another guy in a literal love triangle.

\- she took secret pictures of him without consent, got caught, and blamed it on her cousin.

\- she went in our group chat and said she had a second crush. and when she described him, it was literally the exact same description of my ex.

so at this point, i was thinking to myself WHY is she still in his life? WHY is he not setting boundaries? and then i learned the whole schools dislikes her. she is universally disliked. it's not just me or my friends, she is an actual menace to society. yet, my ex still wouldn't cut her off. on top of that, i gave him seven paragraphs of advice to prevent this from happening even more - i got almost no response.

february 2025 - i came to a realization that i was the only one respecting my own relationship. i sat in silence for three hours. not because i was trying to be dramatic, but because i was slowly accepting that he was never going to do anything about it. that if i wanted to be defended, i would have to ask for it. if you have to beg someone to defend you, you're not being loved the way you deserve.

march 2025 - yeah, here's the final straw. he told his best friend that he wanted to be single.... but didn't tell me. i found out through someone else, and when i confronted him, it was clear. he was too scared to set boundaries, too scared to lose people, too scared to act. i really wanted to put myself in his shoes and see why he could be acting like this, but i just couldn't. i tried to sort things out again with him privately and he only gave me vague, passive responses that he'd never do it again. the next day, he lied to me, he still engaged with her. so i made the decision for him - i left. it was the most peaceful i've felt in forever even though i still love him very dearly. it's been a few weeks since, and my mind is still adjusting.

to be honest, i love giving him advice because i want him to be a better person in the future, we all make mistakes right? and i love when people take my advice into consideration in general... but if you tell me you're gonna take my words into consideration and lie to me the day after, i don't know what to do anymore.

\- the girl was not a victim. she knew exactly what she was doing.

\- my ex was never strong enough to put me first.

\- if someone hesitates to defend you, they're choosing to let you get hurt. some people will always wait to be chosen. some of us don't wait around to find out.",1,1742453662.0,BreakUps,5,1.0,False

I have been thinking on posting this story somewhere for a little over a year, and I have decided that this community would probably love the tea. I am fully prepared to receive my judgement, be it what it may! Now, onto the context and the story:

So. First things first. I (now 22f, then 19f) am queer, and aceflux. I like women, and am unsure how I feel about men now. I am also autistic. This ends up being super important.

For my Associates degree, I decided to go the the military school where my parents met. It was close, and I thought that maybe I could get lucky and find my future spouse there like my parents did (they have always been very proud about having gone there, and have been married happily for 24 years). Boy, was I wrong.

While there, I met a guy (19-20m). We shared some classes together the first year, and we grew close enough that first year that I considered him a friend. Not someone who I would go to with all my tea, but we did the group projects together and helped each other out of trouble.

The second year we were there, we got a lot closer the first semester. He was now in the group of friends I sat with for every day, every meal (boarding school situation). We both now had leadership positions, so it was really nice having another officer friend I could lean on who was the same rank as me, so we would pass on information one person missed, and bitch about people driving us up a wall.

It was over half way into our last semester where I developed a big fat crush on this guy. I mean, the whole cartoon heart eyes and everything. I think for a while he was oblivious, but I am unfortunately at subtle as a cement truck thought a brick wall about these things. I seriously debated asking him out though, because I cherished our friendship and we had the same friend group, and if anything went wrong while we were dating I didn't want to drag our mutual friends into it. He also knew I was queer and liked women as well, and seemed ok with it. I eventually decided that if we did end up splitting up, we were such good friends that we could probably go back to being friends with no resentment or drama. (Spoiler alert, that is not at all what happened.)

So I end up asking him out, and everything is great for two, maybe three weeks. He's acting just like the friend I knew; caring, attentive, and focused on my mind and ideas instead of my body. While I like my body, I don't like partners being into me BECAUSE of my body, but as like a delightful perk. The only change was just going out on dates with just the two of us, instead of the whole friend group (although we still hung out a ton with them.)

It's just that the more we continued dating, the more he seemed to change. He started getting really physical with me, always wanting to hold my hand, or cling on me, or make out. Which at first, I was totally on board with! I am a person who usually really enjoys cuddles. However, I didn't want them the 24/7 that he seemed to want them, but I chalked it up to us graduating really soon and going back home to our home states.

Another thing he did that eventually made me fall out of love with him is every time we texted, called, or hung out in person, he seemed to bring up 1. How hot I was, and 2. Bring up his ex girlfriends. Now , I like being called hot, but I more appreciate you actually listening to whatever I was talking about (usually something important to me, like my family, homework, my job, or fandoms I'm in) and commenting on that. I'm not kidding, it felt like every time I was talking about something important to me,he would zone out halfway though and just compliment me on my looks when I was done talking. That hurt a lot, as I became friends with him BECAUSE he didn't comment on my looks, except when I put extra effort into looking nice and he could tell, or when I looked like microwaved soup someone spilled on the sidewalk (ie, like shit.) 

And the ex thing. This pissed me off SO BADLY. We would be having a nice date or hanging out together, and he would say something like ""yeah, my ex did *insert thing*, but don't worry, I won't."" or what ended up feeling like his catch fraise ""Yeah, I had an ex who was super clingy, and it annoyed me at the time, but now I get it."" Meanwhile, he was ignoring me when I said that we didn't have to be attached at the hip. (He also said I love you like, RIGHT after we agreed to start dating, but I feel like everything else was a bigger problem.)

Another thing he did, was joke about how I was such a good 1950's housewife. Now, for some context: I know how to and enjoy doing a lot of typically feminine things, sewing,  knitting, baking, cooking, etc. I also enjoy making a wearing a lot of historic or vintage clothing, including the 50's. I had made this joke a time or two with my girl friends when they were astonished I pulled out another new craft that I've known how to do for awhile. So I guess he heard me make the joke and repeated it. Which, while I am perfectly comfortable making that joke about me, it feels weird to make it about other people. It especially felt weird coming from him, even if he didn't mean anything by it.

So we graduate and move back to our home states, and we started doing long distance. In the beginning it felt like everything was starting to go back to normal. We would talk about our day, and what we were doing. But eventually, he stops asking me how my day was going. He got SUPER into going into the gym around this time, so he would just send me a photo of him at the gym and a horny message about how much he wanted me there with him. Not asking about my day, not anything. Just horny. As again, as stated above, I hated it. I felt like he only started going out with me because of my body, and lost some self confidence because of it. But I was a non confrontational person unless pushed to extremes, and I was moving to a different state on the other side of the country for an internship, so I did start ignoring him and his texts, using the move as a deflection. Not the best response, I know.

This continued for a few (3-4? Idk, I forget) months after I move. I would respond sometimes, trying to share my life with him, and getting a new horny message every day. After those few months, I decided that I needed to talk with him about how I was feeling, so I did. We had a video call, and I explained to him that I didn't like that much attention and how it made me feel kinda worthless and unappreciated. I had thought that he understood, and he backed off the horniness for a bit. Before going right back to it after maybe a month, month and a half. I don't even remember what he did for my birthday. I think he called, but I don't remember, and I know I didn't get a birthday text from him, which was another thing that hurt me. He did end up sending me a box of gifts, which did have some nice things, like earrings. Except for the fact that my ears aren't pierced, and never have been. 

But whatever, I was huffing the copium and thought that maybe I hadn't articulated myself very well, and my internship was up soon anyway,  so I would return home and start going to the Uni close by, that he also attended. Everything would be finneeeeeee...

And it was, for maybe a week, before he got right back on his bs. This was in early February 2024. It was nearing our one year anniversary, and I felt so unappreciated and uncomfortable. I gave myself an ultimatum: I would invite him to dinner and talk about my feelings again, and reset those boundaries. If I didn't feel like they were being respected by the time our mutual friends graduated (a few months from then), I would break up with him. I put it till after their graduation because we were both planning on going, and I didn't wanna make them upset and feel like they had to choose sides. (I have joked to friends that if this is how divorce with kids feels like, then I am going to do my damdest to never go though it again.)

(Trust me, I am just as surprised as you are at how well I managed to glue those rose colored glasses to my face, and how hard I was huffing that copium.)

So we have the dinner and reset boundaries, and I invite him on a camping trip that my family and some family friends go on together every year, just to see how that goes. And it goes. Poorly. I am not a morning person. Never have, never will be. But even after knowing this, he still decides to greet me every morning after I crawl out of my tent by gluing himself to my hip. And he will not leave. I am talking, he is pressed up against my side, playing with my hair before I have even had any coffee. However, I keep my cool, and we proceed with the weekend, which I did enjoy. After everything, he sends me a text complimenting me on how well I handled everything, including my little brother that weekend, and how I am going to make such a good mother some day. (I'm going to be honest, the audacity of this text still makes me mad to this day.) 

The weekend after, I go to a gallentines girls night with a friend from middle school and some friends of hers that she wants me to met. My then bf knows about this, and kind of pouts, but I'm also mad at him so I didn't care. Plus, the weekend prior was the camping trip, and we were together from Friday to Sunday. The group is all so sweet, and we all still hang out when we have the time.

Now, here is the part where I might be the a-hole. See, in military school, everyone is constantly joking about making out with each other and more. Especially if it is two guys. My whole fiened group back at militry school made those jokes, and it was never taken seriously. And at girls night, we were talking about that and how this friend group (myself included, even before I met them) doesn't always see kissing someone as something strictly romantic, but something that can be done on like the hand or the cheek with friends. So as a joke, because I had been texting my then bf as we were hanging out, if he would be upset if I kissed the homies. I really didn't mean anything by it, as even though I was almost 100% convinced I was gonna break up with him, I would never cheat. And I could have worded it better over text, that one is on me.

He then blows up my phone saying that he isn't comfortable with that, and ask how drunk I am. I say ok and that i wasnt drink, reasureing him that it was just a joke like everyone at school did, and that I wasn't going to do anything. He kept insisting that he wasn't OK with it for a few more messages, before demanding we speak in person on Monday, after my last class. At this point in the evening, I said fuck it and just texted back ok, I wasn't going to do anything, and enjoyed the rest of my evening. 

The next Monday, we met up after class. Now normally, he had a smile for me, and we would talk on our way to my bus stop. This time, he gave me the coldest look I had ever been given. I mean, the kind of glare you give someone who kicked ur puppy or spat in ur drink or something. He then stands up from the bench he was seated on and gives me the classic Mom 'you better get ur butt over here now' kinda finger gesture. You know the one parents give kids who are misbehaving and are NOT going to yell at them. Yeah, that one.

They already pisses me off, because he didn't say one damn word. The disrespect this man is showing me already puts me in a terrible mood. But I follow because I am in a state of shock and not going to yell at him in front of the English building in the middle of campus. When we are off to thr side on a little used sidewalk, he says in the coldest voice imaginable that he is going to give me one chance to explain myself, before starting to talk some more. I cut him off and tell me that he cannot speak to me in that tone with that disrespect. I then explain the above to him again.

He then tells me that after I sent that first text, he got really paranoid and asked for advice from his parents, some friends, and his coworkers. He said that they all agreed that it was weird for me to even make jokes about that, and that I had done a ton of things ""wrong"" that he overlooked (honestly,  I don't remember them all bc I was seeing red.) I do remember him implying that me being queer and going to girls night without him was wrong. I snapped back that he constantly broke boundaries that I had set, and some other things he did that I wasn't 100% ok with, like drinking with my ex. After this argument, we agreed to break up. (Thinking back on it, we were rather close to the building. I hope someone got some good drama to listen to during class.)

I didn't being this up at the time, but I have wondered sense this convo if that means that 1. He outed me to like 20 people, or 2. If he made it sound like I went to a party with a ton of guys without him. Either way, he made me sound like a slut to a ton of people. And while I don't mind if people close to me know I'm LGBTQIA+, I don't like people I don't know knowing, especially because I live in a Red state (gotta love the US, /sarcasm).

But anyways: Am I the a-hole for joking to my BF about me kissing another girl?",1,1742453383.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.67,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating the perfect ice cream involves more than just mixing cream and sugar; it‚Äôs about finding that ideal balance of sweetness that will tantalize your taste buds. Following a baker's ratio can help you achieve this balance, ensuring your ice cream is not too sweet or too bland. In this guide, we will explore how to measure ingredients properly and understand the science behind sweetness in ice cream.

### Understanding Sweetness Levels

Sweetness in ice cream isn‚Äôt just about sugar‚Äîit‚Äôs a combination of various ingredients. To find the right balance, consider how each component contributes:

- **Sugars:** Granulated sugar, brown sugar, honey, or agave syrup all bring varying levels of sweetness and flavor.
- **Concentrations:** The concentration of your base (cream and milk) affects how sweet the ice cream tastes.
- **Flavorings:** Ingredients like chocolate, fruit purees, or vanilla can modify the perception of sweetness.

### The Baker's Ratio Explained

The baker's ratio is a simple mathematical formula used in baking that can also help with making ice cream. This ratio takes into account the equal weight of sugar to milk or cream used. The general guideline is:

- **1:2:2** ‚Äî one part sugar, two parts cream, and two parts milk.
- This means if you use one cup of sugar (200g), you should use two cups of cream (480ml) and two cups of milk (480ml).

Using this ratio allows you to experiment without straying too far from a successful recipe.

### Choosing the Right Type of Sugar

Different sugars can alter the flavor of your ice cream:

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
- **Granulated Sugar:** Provides a clean sweetness and enhances texture.
- **Brown Sugar:** Adds a hint of caramel flavor, which can balance creaminess.
- **Agave Syrup:** Has a lower glycemic index and dissolves well but can result in a different mouthfeel.
- **Honey:** Offers a distinct taste but can overpower subtle flavors.

### Finding Your Ideal Sweetness

To find the right level of sweetness, start with the baker's ratio. As you make your ice cream, taste the base before churning. A good rule of thumb is that you want your base to be sweeter than it should taste when frozen. This is because freezing can mute flavors, including sweetness. Here are some tips:

- Start with the basic ratio to gauge initial sweetness.
- Adjust sweetness according to the flavor profile; for instance, chocolate-based recipes may require less sugar than fruity ones.
- Allow for final adjustments after churning; some sweeteners may need extra time to develop their flavors.

### Testing and Tasting

Testing your ice cream is crucial in finding the perfect balance of sweetness. Here are a few things to consider:

- Chill a small amount of your ice cream base in the freezer and taste after a few hours.
- Look for a harmonious balance where the sweetness complements the other flavors.
- Remember the texture: the sweeter your ice cream, the creamier it might feel due to sugar's interaction with milk solids.

Throughout your process, take note of your tastes and adjustments so you can create your perfect ice cream every time.

### : Mastering Sweetness in Ice Cream

By focusing on the baker‚Äôs ratio and understanding how different ingredients affect sweetness, you can craft delicious ice cream that appeals to everyone. Remember, the goal isn‚Äôt just to make ice cream that is sweet but to create a dessert that engages all the senses. Happy ice cream making!

The Role of Flavor Enhancers in Ice Cream Making: Beyond Sweetness
------------------------------------------------------------------

When crafting delicious ice cream, many bakers focus primarily on sweetness. However, the true artistry of this creamy treat lies in the nuanced use of flavor enhancers that elevate the overall taste experience. Understanding how to utilize these enhancers can help you create a more balanced and delightful ice cream that goes beyond mere sweetness.

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
Flavor enhancers play a crucial role in ice cream, as they help to deepen and expand the taste profile. Here are some key components to consider when incorporating flavor enhancers into your ice cream making process:

### Utilizing Salt

Salt is a vital component in enhancing the flavors of ice cream. While it might seem counterintuitive to add salt to a sweet dessert, it actually helps to bring out the sweetness and overall flavor complexity. A small pinch of salt can balance flavors and prevent your ice cream from tasting overly sweet, making it more enjoyable. Consider sea salt or Himalayan pink salt for added depth.

### Introducing Acidity

Acidic ingredients are another way to enhance the flavor profile of your ice cream. Using ingredients like lemon juice, yogurt, or buttermilk can provide a refreshing tartness that cuts through sweetness. This contrast not only highlights flavors but also adds a layer of sophistication. Here are some ideas:

- Use lemon zest for a citrusy kick.
- Add yogurt for tanginess.
- Incorporate buttermilk for a creamy and acidic touch.

### Playing with Bitterness

Bitterness, when added in moderation, can provide balance to the sweetness of ice cream. Think of dark chocolate, espresso, or roasted nuts as excellent options to create this contrast. They serve to enhance the flavor profile and add complexity. Here are a few suggestions:

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
- Use dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate for deeper flavor.
- Infuse your ice cream base with brewed coffee.
- Add crushed almonds or hazelnuts for a nutty bitter note.

### Emphasizing Aromatics

The role of aromatics in flavor enhancement should not be overlooked. Ingredients such as vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and herbs can create a more rounded flavor experience. Utilizing high-quality extracts and fresh spices will ensure that their aromatic qualities shine through. You can experiment with the following:

- Infuse your cream with vanilla pods.
- Sprinkle cinnamon for a warm spiciness.
- Add fresh mint leaves for a refreshing aspect.

### Textural Elements

Texture greatly impacts how we perceive flavor. Ice cream that contains mix-ins like nuts, chocolate chips, or fruits can create dynamic flavor experiences. These elements can add crunch, chewiness, or creaminess, making each bite interesting. Consider including:

- Chopped cookies for added crunch.
- Swirls of fudge for a rich flavor experience.
- Fresh or roasted fruits to introduce natural sweetness and acidity.

### Experimenting with Spices

Spices are often underutilized in ice cream crafting. They can impart warmth and depth that enhances overall flavor. Spices such as cardamom, ginger, or even black pepper can provide a surprising touch. Each of these options can add layers to your ice cream, creating a unique profile that keeps your palate engaged.

Ultimately, balancing sweetness in ice cream involves more than just adjusting sugar levels. By incorporating salt, acidity, bitterness, aromatics, and texture, you can create a strikingly well-rounded dessert that offers a delightful experience with every bite. Experiment with different combinations of flavor enhancers to truly discover the potential of your ice cream recipes.

This journey to mastering flavor can transform your ice cream from a simple dessert into an intricate flavor experience that delights friends and family alike. So, next time you whip up a batch, remember that sweetness is just one part of the equation. Embrace the power of flavor enhancers and see how they can take your creations to new heights.

### Conclusion

Finding the perfect balance of sweetness in ice cream is both an art and a science. By understanding the baker‚Äôs ratio, you equip yourself with the essential tools to create a delightful dessert that pleases everyone. The ideal ratios not only ensure a pleasant sweetness but also pave the way for a smooth and creamy texture, essential for making irresistible ice cream.

Equally important are flavor enhancers, which transform your ice cream from merely sweet to a complex and delightful treat. Ingredients like salt, acids, or even a hint of vanilla can highlight flavors and create depth, elevating the overall experience. These enhancements complement the sweetness, ensuring it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm but rather harmonizes with the other elements.

When crafting your ice cream, consider both the baker‚Äôs ratio and the role of flavor enhancers. Experiment with different combinations and adjustments until you discover your signature blend. Remember to take notes along the way to refine your technique. The goal is to create a rich, satisfying treat that balances sweetness and flavor in a way that resonates with your taste buds.

Whether you‚Äôre an experienced baker or a novice chef, achieving the perfect sweetness level in ice cream opens doors to endless delicious possibilities. So, roll up your sleeves and get creative in the kitchen. With practice and passion, your homemade ice cream will not only be sweet but also unforgettable.

1jfit4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1jfit4z/highfunctioning_autism_is_a_pointless_diagnosis/,"""High-functioning"" autism is a pointless diagnosis","Most people with level 1 ASD are practically within the ""normal"" spectrum of human psychology. The diagnostic levels for ASD are essentially a metric of how much support someone will need. Level 1 means that this person can function fine in society, independently, with minimal or no support. They might have some issues socializing/communicating, or have ""odd"" habits, but that's about it.

So what even is the point? If you are able to function completely fine, how does being labeled as autistic/disordered benefit you in any way? The entire concept of a mental disorder is that it significantly impacts your ability to live a ""normal"" life, e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, level 2+ ASD, etc. Are you even ""disordered"" if you are able to live independently and be a productive member of society? I don't think being a bit strange is enough to warrant the label of ""disorder"". Everyone has quirks, the only thing that really matters is whether or not you can live independently.

It especially makes zero sense for someone to be diagnosed with level 1 ASD as an adult. You might say ""well, it helps them understand why they've felt different their entire life!"". Do we really need to pathologize everything? This seems harmful to me, we should be able to accept ourselves and our unique traits. Wouldn't it be better to think ""I am different from my peers in some ways, but that's okay, it is what makes me an individual""? Instead, people get an autism diagnosis and then reduce all of their peculiar traits down to the disorder... but they're not disordered, they can lead ""normal"" adult lives. This just doesn't seem healthy to me at all.

Finally, most of the ""symptoms"" and behaviors associated with high-functioning autism are extremely common, to the point where they're standard human experiences/behaviors. I have no idea how any of the following is abnormal:

* Repetitive behaviors or physical habits. Foot tapping, hair twirling, chair rocking, etc. These are all extremely common behaviors people do to 'self-soothe'. 25% of people talk to themselves when they are alone, and that's just the people who admit it! They sit in their houses or cars, alone, and self-talk, often repeating the same words/phrases.
* Obsession with specific interests. The entirety of society relies on individuals becoming hyper-specialized in a field or job. If this were not the case, there would be no professions or skilled labor: doctors, lawyers, engineers, programmers, etc. 
* Difficulty making eye contact. Most people don't make constant, unbreaking eye contact with others. They find it uncomfortable. If you pay attention during conversation, you will notice people look away or at your mouth/forehead instead of your eyes. Most mammals view direct eye contact with strangers as a challenge and threat, so of course it is natural to dislike and avoid it.
* Dislike of changes to routine. The vast majority of people do not enjoy when unexpected things happen to them. Humans are called ""creatures of habit"" for a reason, we are very habitual, repeating our behaviors and having little routines. Most people do this and find it difficult and unpleasant to change their habits. Morning coffee, eating specific foods or at a specific time, showering daily, smoking after a meal, etc.
* ""Masking"" is something every functioning person on the planet does, of course we all suppress our urges and behave differently in the presence of other people. As I mentioned above, atleast 25% of people talk to themselves when they are alone. However, if somebody self-talks in public, they will be viewed as mentally ill. This is because it is normal to ""mask"" or hide these behaviors in public, it's abnormal to not ""mask"".
* Difficulties socializing and communicating. 30-36% of adolescents have social anxiety so severe that they'd meet the diagnostic criteria for SAD (social anxiety disorder). Most people have felt socially anxious or awkward and have had difficulties communicating at various points in their lives. It's even more common now as a result of modern technology.

If a trait or experience is applicable to >20% of the population, how the hell is it abnormal?! If this is the diagnostic standard, the reality is that the vast majority of people could go be diagnosed with level 1 ASD. I genuinely believe that. If they aren't diagnosed by the first psychologist they see, they could go just go see new ones until they are. I'd would guess that 90% of people between the ages of 15-30 would be diagnosed with autism by 1/10 psychologists. They wouldn't even need to lie or exaggerate their experiences, that's how common the ""symptoms"" are. It's completely pointless.",6,1742452807.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,24,0.75,False
1jfirlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1jfirlp/need_advice_on_whether_or_not_to_start_an_ldr/,Need advice on whether or not to start an LDR [27f/27m],"I have known my friend for 5+ years now. Over the last \~1.5 years, we got a lot more closer and have hung out a lot 1:1 and in groups. We have a lot of common interests: movies, art, coffee shops, which fueled these. We have also both been single for this period of time (and were in relationships right before that). 

About 6 months ago, I moved away for a new job (across the country). Before I left, I could feel some tension and that I was maybe falling for him and he as well; some of my friends pointed it out too. However, I was moving and was excited to do so, and was also not fully ready to be in a relationship either, so I just ignored the thought. Fast forward to now, surprisingly, we have stayed in touch and chat quite frequently. I say surprisingly because he is usually shy and quiet. 

A few weeks ago, I once again started having thoughts about liking him, and what us dating would look like. But I came down to the conclusion that with the distance between us, compounded by some anxiety of being in a relationship on my end, it's probably not worth it. Going through this thought process, I found myself having made peace with the fact that we are probably good enough as friends, and maybe I need to consciously dial down on how much we talk to not be giving wrong signals (although our conversations are not intimate in any way, and are mostly about shared interests). 

  
But now he brought it up and shared that he has feelings for me, and did so very respectfully acknowledging that he'd understand if I didn't feel similarly. I told him that I did, but was conflicted about whether to do anything about it mainly due to distance. When we talked more as I wanted to hear what page he was on, he said he'd like to give it a shot but also said a number of conflicting things such as even if I were interested, he's not sure how we'd go about it, and that he's not ready to go all in but would like to see if this goes anywhere.   
  
I personally also felt like I wasn't sure how willing I'd be to put in effort into early stages of figuring out things which to me sound very taxing in a long-distance setting, and rather fun if you're in the same place. At the end of all this, I figured if neither of us are in a state to really put effort into this, starting a LD anything isn't going to work. So I conveyed the same to him (not verbatim but in nicer words). I have high self-preservation instincts since a bad previous relationship, so that definitely kicks in.  He said he understood, but I could sense that he was hurt, and we haven't talked since which is completely reasonable.

Now, in theory, I want to believe that this is it, and I made the right decision. But it's been bothering me, and sometimes I feel maybe I was reading too much into the semantics and sometimes you just need to go for it. I do like him and remember feeling very comfortable around him, but also haven't seem him in so long that it's hard to sustain the liking which admittedly is a part of my hesitation. Most of all, selfishly, I think had he said he was more sure about us, and wanted to put in the effort, I think I would have said yes. I am the kind who usually takes a while to get to the point where I am willing to put all effort in, so I am disappointed but not surprised by own instinct. Additionally, I also know that he's very shy so I can see that while he may have intended to say otherwise, he ended up playing safe (however that's not for me to guess? I can only work with the information I have?).

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

The dawn of the 21st century brings a quiet terror to the United States and the world as a whole‚Äîa fertility crisis that hollows out families and frays the nation‚Äôs spirit. Birth rates plummet as environmental decay and societal shifts take their toll, leaving hospitals haunted by silence and desperate parents. In Metro Detroit, Michigan, amid this creeping despair, Andrew Pryce - a former US Army Chaplain- steps forward , not as a preacher, but now as a career counselor with a steady gaze and a calculated mind. Once a man who guided the unemployed through job fairs and resumes, Pryce now sees a higher calling. He founds the Sons of Jacob, a group born from his conviction that America‚Äôs sins‚Äîsecularism, feminism, and moral rot‚Äîhave cursed it with barrenness. Drawing from Genesis, where Rachel offers her handmaid Bilhah to Jacob, Pryce envisions a return to a Godly order, a patriarchy to restore the nation‚Äôs fruitfulness.

Pryce‚Äôs office in Detroit becomes the movement‚Äôs cradle. He meets men like Nick Blaine, a young drifter reeling from his brother‚Äôs alcoholism and a string of dead-end jobs. Over coffee, Pryce listens to Nick‚Äôs woes and offers more than employment tips‚Äîhe speaks of a religious group, the Sons of Jacob, poised to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù the country. It‚Äôs a pitch he‚Äôs honed, targeting the lost and the angry, men who feel the world has turned its back on them. Through his role, Pryce builds a network, chapter by chapter, across thirty states, his calm authority drawing in early believers. Among them is Fred Waterford, a marketing whiz with a knack for branding, whose wife, Serena Joy, soon amplifies the message with her fiery conservative voice. Another recruit, Warren Putnam, a television executive , joins the fold, his wealth and blunt faith make him a natural ally, though his later lechery hints at the cracks beneath his piety.


By 2005, the Sons of Jacob are no longer a loose idea but a growing force, with Andrew Pryce at its helm. As the group‚Äôs architect, he chairs the Committee, an all-male board that shapes its theocratic vision. Pryce‚Äôs leadership is pragmatic, his career counselor days lending him a knack for organization and persuasion. Fred Waterford rises as his right hand, turning the group‚Äôs raw ideology into a polished campaign, while Serena Joy‚Äôs media presence‚Äîculminating in her 2012 book : A Woman‚Äôs Place - casts a wider net.

The movement‚Äôs muscle takes shape with the Guardians of the Faith. These aren‚Äôt yet the crisp-uniformed enforcers of Gilead but a rough militia, forged from men Pryce and his allies pull from the fringes. Many are former U.S. military‚Äîveterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, restless and disillusioned, their skills wasted in a crumbling economy. Others are ex-law enforcement, like those ousted for excessive force, men who trade badges for a new purpose. They gather in backyards and abandoned lots, drilling with rifles and swearing loyalty to the Sons‚Äô cause. Pryce sees them as ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs shield,‚Äù a force to protect the faithful and, soon, to strike at the unrighteous. Under his watch, the Guardians grow, their ranks swelling with those who crave order in a world slipping away.

As the fertility crisis tightens its grip‚Äîstillbirths a grim chorus in the news‚Äîthe Sons of Jacob flourish. Their chapters dot the country, fueled by Pryce‚Äôs steady recruitment and Serena Joy‚Äôs public crusade. Fred refines the message, weaving it into something palatable yet radical, while Putnam‚Äôs money buys influence and arms. The Committee, with Pryce at its head, plots in secret, a think tank of ultraconservative minds. But cracks emerge. Pryce, ever the purist, pushes for a disciplined Gilead, a vision of order he shares with Nick years later: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to clean it up, son.‚Äù Fred and Putnam, though, lean toward ambition‚ÄîFred with his branding, Putnam with his appetites‚Äîhinting at the corruption Pryce will one day seek to purge.

In 2013, the group‚Äôs intent sharpens. Pryce, Fred, and Putnam huddle with others‚Äîmen like Commander Guthrie, a blunt field commander‚Äîto map their coup. The FBI closes in on some conspirators, forcing the Committee‚Äôs hand. Pryce greenlights ‚Äúthree strikes,‚Äù a plan for devastating attacks to topple the government. The Guardians, now a hardened militia, train relentlessly, their military and police roots giving them an edge. Serena Joy‚Äôs speeches peak, her calls for a ‚Äúbetter way‚Äù a subtle signal to the faithful. The nation teeters, unaware, as small erosions‚Äîwomen‚Äôs bank accounts tied to men, jobs slipping away‚Äîherald the storm.

Pryce, still the Committee‚Äôs steady hand, oversees ‚ÄúOperation Gomorrah,‚Äù a strike set for September 14 to hit the White House, Capitol, and Supreme Court in one blow. Fred crafts the cover story‚Äîblaming Islamic extremists‚Äîwhile Putnam funds the logistics, his wealth greasing the wheels. The Guardians, led by men with military precision, smuggle weapons into D.C., their militia days giving way to a disciplined assault force. Pryce‚Äôs influence ensures insiders‚Äîlike sympathetic officials‚Äîclear the path.


In the bleak months of early 2014, the Sons of Jacob teeter on the brink of discovery. Andrew Pryce, the flinty counselor who birthed the movement in Detroit, feels the FBI‚Äôs breath on his neck. Agents raid a Guardian hideout in Michigan‚Äôs backwoods, hauling away rifles and tattered oaths, piecing together a conspiracy sprawling across thirty states. Missing persons‚Äîlost souls and silent women‚Äîpoint to something darker, and scrambled messages buzz through federal wiretaps. Pryce holds steady, his voice a quiet steel as he meets the Committee in a smoke-hazed room. Fred Waterford spins a web of lies, feeding tales of pious gatherings to the press, while Warren Putnam‚Äôs cash stifles local lawmen, buying precious days.

The feds press hard but move slow, their gears grinding under the weight of red tape. Pryce sees the window narrowing. He summons Fred, Putnam, and the others‚Äîgrim-faced men like Guthrie‚Äîhis words cutting through the tension. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre closing in, but we‚Äôll strike first.‚Äù The plan, ‚ÄúOperation Gomorrah,‚Äù is set for September 14, a triple blow to shatter the nation‚Äôs core. The Guardians of the Faithful, ex-soldiers and cops turned militia, ready their arsenals‚Äîguns oiled, bombs packed. Serena Joy‚Äôs voice pierces the airwaves, her pleas for a ‚Äúnew dawn‚Äù a call to arms. The country drifts on, its eyes shut tight.

Dawn breaks over Washington, D.C. on September 14, the city bathed in a fleeting peace. At the Capitol, that peace shatters first. Guardians, their faces hard beneath civilian caps, slip into the visitors‚Äô gallery overlooking the Senate chamber, let in by sympathetic officers of the Capitol Police. As lawmakers drone below, the gunmen rise, rifles drawn from beneath coats‚Äîex-cops and soldiers, their aim steady from years of service. They open fire, a storm of bullets raining down, tearing through senators and representatives in a crimson haze. The chamber becomes a slaughterhouse, screams swallowed by gunfire as politicians are cut down left and right.

Minutes later, the White House trembles. The President, roused from a Cabinet meeting in the West Wing, is rushed to the Situation Room. But treachery waits within. Compromised Secret Service agents, loyal to the Sons, had planted a suitcase bomb days earlier, its timer ticking silently. As the President and a clutch of Cabinet members‚ÄîSecretaries of State, Defense, and others‚Äîhuddle with executive staff, the device detonates. The blast rips through concrete and steel, killing them all in a flash of heat and ruin, leaving the West Wing of the White House a smoking husk.

The Supreme Court is next. As justices convene in their marble chambers, Guardians burst through the doors‚Äîmore ex-military, their boots echoing on stone. They unload their weapons, bullets shredding robes and wood, leaving the nation‚Äôs highest bench a lifeless ruin. Across the city, the purge widens. Cabinet survivors, those not at the White House, fall in their homes, gunned down by roving squads. The mayor of D.C. slumps in his office, a bullet through his chest, while the police chief dies in his driveway, his car riddled with holes. The Joint Chiefs face the same fate‚Äîexcept the Air Force head and the National Guard Bureau chief, both secretly pledged to the Sons, who slip away unscathed just before a bomb rips through the meeting room in the Pentagon where the Joint Chiefs had been scheduled for a meeting.

By nightfall, Washington is a corpse, its leaders erased in a day of blood and fire. The Capitol lies silent, the White House smolders, the Supreme Court bleeds. The Joint Chiefs‚Äô and Secretary of Defense deaths paralyze the military, save for the Air Force and National Guard, whose leaders now align with Pryce‚Äôs vision. Fred‚Äôs lies flood the air, pinning the carnage on Islamic extremism , a story that takes root in the panic. Putnam‚Äôs gold buys silence and allegiance, while Pryce orchestrates from Michigan, his calm unshaken.

Guardians sweep the streets, their rifles glinting in the dusk, enforcing a new order as martial law descends. Tanks roll in, manned by turncoats and Sons loyalists‚Äîthe Air Force and National Guard chief among them‚Äîclaiming control under a banner of stability. In a Virginia hideout, Fred and Serena draft their gospel, words of salvation for a broken land.



The sun rises on September 15 over a shattered Washington, its leaders reduced to dust and memory. Andrew Pryce, the Sons of Jacob‚Äôs cold-eyed strategist, moves fast from his Detroit stronghold. He gathers the Committee‚ÄîFred Waterford, Warren Putnam, and their inner cadre‚Äîto build a new order from the carnage. A provisional government emerges, a fragile alliance of survivors and plants. A few Republican representatives crawl from the Capitol‚Äôs ruins‚ÄîDaniel Hartz of Ohio, a covert Son whose loyalty runs deep, stands among them, joined by others too broken to fight back. Technocrats bolster the ranks: Roger Ellison, a gaunt energy insider with a Sons of Jacob oath sworn in secret, and Margaret Kline, a logistics master whose zeal matches her precision. They form a brittle shell of authority, the Sons‚Äô will pulsing beneath.

Martial law crashes down like a hammer. The Air Force chief and National Guard Bureau head, both Sons allies, unleash tanks and troops across the mainland, their voices barking over static-laden radios: ‚ÄúOrder will be restored.‚Äù Guardians‚Äîex-soldiers and cops forged into a militia‚Äîlock cities under curfew, their rifles glinting in the dusk. Pryce escalates the terror. On September 20, the Midwest trembles as Fermi 2 near Detroit and Dresden in Illinois spiral into meltdowns. Guardians sabotage the plants under Ellison‚Äôs direction, radiation blooming into the sky. Towns flee in chaos, fields turn toxic, and Fred‚Äôs broadcasts weave a lie of ‚Äúenemy attacks,‚Äù pleading for compliance. The fear takes hold‚Äîmillions shrink into silence, cowed by the double blow of D.C.‚Äôs collapse and nuclear horror‚Äîbut not everyone yields.

October‚Äôs chill brings a harder edge to the provisional rule. Hartz and his Republican peers, propped up by Ellison and Kline, dismantle the old system‚Äîelections vanish, dissenters vanish too. The Sons‚Äô dogma creeps in, masked as survival. Women‚Äôs bank accounts seize up, their wealth handed to men; jobs spit women out, doors barred with ‚Äúemergency‚Äù signs. Guardians stalk the streets, their presence a suffocating weight. Kline chokes supply lines, funneling goods to the obedient, while Ellison snuffs out the internet, ‚Äúpurity laws‚Äù gagging the digital hum. Pryce purges the unfaithful‚Äîclerks and colonels fall to midnight raids, their screams swallowed by the night.

The Midwest‚Äôs glowing wounds loom large, a specter of submission. In Boston, June Osborne holds Hannah close, her editing desk empty as presses still, her life narrowing. Resistance flares, jagged and raw. Chicago‚Äôs alleys spark with firebombs against Guardian posts; Texas ranchers defy the curfew, shotguns at the ready. The provisional rulers strike back. On October 12, Philadelphia boils over‚Äîteachers, nurses, students flood the streets, their chants a fragile defiance. Guardians form ranks, rifles cocked. Putnam‚Äôs growl cuts through a radio: ‚ÄúFinish it.‚Äù The volley erupts, bullets tearing through the crowd, bodies crumpling on stone, blood pooling as survivors scatter. Fred‚Äôs voice follows, slick and soothing, dubbing it ‚Äúorder reclaimed,‚Äù but the gunfire‚Äôs echo promises more brutality.

November hardens the provisional grip. Guardians battle rebels‚ÄîChicago smolders, Texas bristles‚Äîbut the Sons‚Äô hold tightens on the mainland. The National Guard, steered by its complicit chief, quells uprisings, their boots stamping out flickers of hope. The Midwest meltdowns haunt the air, a grim lullaby of compliance. Women like June face capture, swept into camps for their wombs; men like Luke plot in whispers, their paths thinning. Philadelphia‚Äôs slaughter scars the nation, its blood a lesson carved deep.

Not all kneel. Alaska and Hawaii stand defiant, rejecting martial law outright. In Anchorage, the governor‚Äîa grizzled ex-senator‚Äîspits at the Sons‚Äô edicts, his state‚Äôs isolation a shield; no tanks roll there, no Guardians patrol. Hawaii‚Äôs governor, flanked by loyal Navy hands, bars the decrees, the islands‚Äô shores a wall against the tide. Their leaders‚Äîsenators, admirals‚Äîmutter of resistance, their defiance a spark but not yet a flame. On the mainland, California grumbles, its governor hoarding power; Texas digs in, its oil a stronghold. Canada‚Äôs border swells with the fleeing, a thin stream escaping the clamp. Pryce‚Äôs provisional rule reigns, its authoritarian heart unyielding, the Midwest‚Äôs terror and Philadelphia‚Äôs dead paving the way for Gilead‚Äôs rise.

By January 2015, the provisional government‚Äôs mask begins to slip. Andrew Pryce, the Sons of Jacob‚Äôs unyielding architect, senses the moment is ripe. The Committee‚ÄîFred Waterford, Warren Putnam, and their technocrat allies like Roger Ellison and Margaret Kline‚Äîhas crushed enough dissent and sown enough fear to claim their prize. In a broadcast from a commandeered D.C. studio, Pryce‚Äôs voice cuts through the static, declaring the United States dissolved , and announcing the formation of the Divine Republic of Gilead.

The provisional shell cracks open, revealing the theocracy beneath: a nation under God‚Äôs law, its borders claiming the mainland‚Äôs heart from the Northeast to the Midwest. Guardians shed their militia roots, donning crisp uniforms, their rifles now symbols of divine order. Women like June Osborne vanish into Red Centers, their lives rewritten as Handmaids; men like Luke scramble for escape, the noose tightening.

The Midwest‚Äôs nuclear scars‚ÄîFermi 2 and Dresden‚Äîstill glow, a testament to the Sons‚Äô terror, while Philadelphia‚Äôs bloodied streets whisper of their ruthlessness. Daniel Hartz, the Ohio Republican turned Gilead loyalist, takes a Commander‚Äôs mantle, his voice echoing Pryce‚Äôs decrees. Fred and Serena, now Waterfords in full, craft Gilead‚Äôs gospel, their words sanctifying the regime. Putnam‚Äôs wealth props up the new state, his gruff pride swelling as the Air Force and National Guard, led by their complicit chiefs, enforce Gilead‚Äôs will. But the declaration splinters the nation‚Äînot all bow to this new republic.

The Second American Civil War has begun. California, long a simmering thorn, erupts in defiance. Its governor, a wiry pragmatist, rallies the state militia‚Äîloyal National Guard units untainted by the Sons‚Äîand seals the coast, San Francisco a fortress against Gilead‚Äôs reach. Florida follows, its governor tapping swamp-hardened sheriffs and rogue Marines to resist, Miami a humid bastion of rebellion. Texas, ever a lone star, declares itself independent, its ranchers and oil barons arming to the teeth, Houston a citadel beyond Gilead‚Äôs grasp. The Sons‚Äô provisional grip‚Äîstrong in the Northeast and Midwest‚Äîfalters at these edges, their Guardians clashing with rebels in bloody skirmishes.

In the shadows, a ghost stirs. FBI Director William Carver, a lean man with a hawk‚Äôs gaze, survived the September 14 assassination attempt on the Joint Chiefs. Shot in his Virginia home but left for dead, he crawled away, bleeding but alive, and vanished into hiding. For months, he evaded the Sons‚Äô purges, moving through safehouses, his fury simmering. In May 2015, he surfaces in Anchorage, Alaska, where defiance has kept martial law at bay. Meeting with a ragged council‚Äîsenators who fled D.C., Navy admirals from Hawaii, Alaska‚Äôs governor‚Äîhe lays bare the truth. ‚ÄúThe Sons of Jacob were ours to break,‚Äù Carver rasps, his voice raw. ‚ÄúWe had them‚Äîfiles, tapes, their whole damn network. They hit us before we could move. It was a coup, plain and simple.‚Äù

The room stills. The authorities‚Äîalready wary of Gilead‚Äôs rise‚Äîsee the pieces snap into place: the attacks, the meltdowns, the swift takeover. Carver‚Äôs words ignite a spark. Alaska, free of Gilead‚Äôs yoke, becomes a rallying point; Hawaii, its shores unbowed, joins the call. Guardians probe their borders, but the states hold firm, their isolation a shield.

Civil war flares across the summer. Gilead‚Äôs heartland‚Äîthe Northeast, Midwest, parts of the South‚Äîsolidifies under Pryce‚Äôs iron rule, its Commanders like Hartz and Putnam enforcing the Handmaid system, their Guardians a wall of steel. California fights tooth and nail, its cities scarred by airstrikes from the Sons‚Äô Air Force chief, yet unyielding. California National Guard tanks duel with the Guardians tanks that try to invade from occupied Nevada. The California state line sees some of the most brutal warfare in modern history. Florida‚Äôs forests and swamps bloom with guerrilla war, rebels striking from the shadows. The Florida National Guard splits , with heavy fighting across the state as national guardsmen fight each other . The pro USA faction wins out, with Pro Gilead national guard units being taken out, and the state remaining in the Union. Texas officially secedes from the Union, its oil fields a prize neither The US nor Gilead can claim. Chicago, a contested ruin, sees daily battles‚ÄîGilead‚Äôs forces against Mayday insurgents, the city a bleeding wound.

In Anchorage, Carver‚Äôs revelation galvanizes the remnants. Alaska and Hawaii, defying martial law since the start, coalesce into a rump United States. The Governor and surviving Senators declare Anchorage the new capital, Hawaii a Pacific stronghold, their Navy ships a lifeline. Carver, his wounds a badge, joins their council, urging strikes on Gilead‚Äôs flanks. Refugees flood north‚ÄîLuke among them, Hannah torn from June‚Äôs arms‚Äîswelling Canada‚Äôs border as Gilead‚Äôs grip tightens. The Sons press their advantage, but the nation fractures, a patchwork of war and will, the Republic of Gilead‚Äôs birth baptized in fire.

1jfip5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/endocrinology/comments/1jfip5r/cortisol_parameters_for_secondary_adrenal/,Cortisol parameters for secondary adrenal insufficiency,"Lab report states that 138-650 nmol/L is normal, but my research indicates that if a patient presents with adrenal symptoms after taking a glucocorticoid, then a 9am cortisol of:

* <138 nmol/L is confirmation of Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency (SAI)
* 138 nmol/L to 500 nmol/L is inconclusive and requires further testing to confirm or exclude SAI
* \>500 nmol/L generally excludes SAI as a possibility

I have presented with adrenal symptoms after/during prednisolone, doctor ordered tests but failed to include any adrenal tests (?!?).  All those tests come back normal.  I finally realised two months later that adrenals had been missed completely and I'm still having the adrenal symptoms.  Cortisol test comes back as 295 nmol/L, is this truly a normal cortisol result, or considering my symptoms, is it inconclusive, requiring further testing?

The doctor treated me like a basketcase during that time, and told me it wasn't possible to react after a short 12 day course of prenisolone (symptoms began on day 6 which was the day after the first tapered dose).  He treated me like it was all in my head, told me to go and ""focus on my wellbeing"" and he's sure I'll start to feel better soon.  I did that for 3+ months now, and I have been hesitant to return to him as I expect further judgement and prejudice, despite my gut feel that it was and still is secondary adrenal insufficiency.  It has now been 6 months and I still experience symptoms everyday, and fatigue that is debilitating.  Sometimes it feels like my fight or flight response is worsening and last week my hands, teeth, and body shook badly for 8 hours straight after I drank one cup of store bought coffee without knowing how it would affect me.

So my questions were:

What is the correct way to analyse the 9am cortisol level of a patient exhibiting adrenal symptoms after a course of prednisolone?

Is it unheard of for a patient to react to a high dose prednisolone course on just day 6 of that course?

EDITED to add: Doctor is a general practitioner, not an endo.  But if GP doctors are the ones to diagnose/refer these issues in Australia, shouldn't they be aware of these important parameters.  He would not refer me to an endo as all my tests were ""normal"".",1,1742452303.0,endocrinology,0,1.0,False

Enough time for day-trips?,"Just booked a 10-day solo trip to Italy. I land in Rome on April 7th, plan to visit Florence & Bologna, and fly out of Venice. My outline so far looks like this...

\-Land in Rome morning of Day 1

\-Day 1-3 Rome (Leave Day 4)

\-Day 4-5 Florence (Leave Day 6)

\-Day 6-8 Bologna (Leave Day 9)

\-Day 9-10 Venice

\-Fly out from Venice the afternoon of Day 11

I'm also hoping I can work in a day-trip or two, but I'm worried that might be a little too ambitious when I only have 2-3 days in each city. A few spots that have piqued my interest are **Lucca**, **Siena**, **Ravenna**, and **Orvietto**. Are any of these worth a day-trip, maybe even an overnight stay? Or do you think that's just not enough time to even enjoy my main 4 cities?

I'm on a modest budget, do not drink, and like to wander. Into music, coffee, crafts, food... and people-watching (non-tourists). Seeing how different people live their lives & find fulfillment is something I'm very interested in, and I feel like I won't get a good swath of that if I just stick to these main cities. I've also been to Rome & Venice about 10 years ago... So while I only remember vague snippets 'cause of my goldfish memory, that does make me feel less nervous about spending less time in those two cities.

Flexing his destroyers like great bristling fingers over harvester hands that would support them, carrier arms providing fighter muscle and corvette shoulders to pivot the whole force on.

His main body was still the hulk he was born inside of but he'd shaved it down, reorganized its crumbling halls, revitalized its habitation and cold storage systems.

Now he emerged from interstellar anonymity onto a star system bristling with mass, still days of light traval away from the planet he desired, though he had broadcast his intent some months ago.

Plasma thrusters churned with their esoteric flames and ploughed his mass forward, he had a bias to the white-gold color that he inherited from the salvage. The hull of his craft though, carbon black, wherever it was practical. Where there needed to be metal it was burnished black or left covered in the rainbow oxides copper made when heat treated.

Every ship in the fleet might shared the scheme, save for one, an unarmed destroyer with more computation and communication equipment than normal. It was the ambassador and headed the current fleet with anodized blue metal and ivory hull plating. 

That ambassador ship stayed well ahead of his main mass generally described an egg shaped exclusion zone a few c scale milliseconds around him. Basically the space he considered his jurisdiction.

The old AI did the equivalent of sit back and sip coffee as he sailed inward, passing fewer comets now and more dwarf planets or trojans.

Themestaties pondered a bit how the species would react to his claim. By all accounts they were an empire, powerful and militarily capable but newly expanded with soft borders. It would be very interesting to see how they react to such an incursion.

Would they apply violence in overwhelming mass and repel him with new and valuable data? Would they put up a token bombardment and leave him be? Or would they send stealthy projectiles to trike him from another angle and use it to blame someone else?

He was absolutely giddy with the possibilities, sipping at the comet he heals over his reactor with an anticipation buzzing away inside him.

Another space hill woke up and decided to start moving. Bad.

It was moving into the system sending out waves of broadcasts saying ""I'm parking my ass here and colonizing this rock."" Worse.

That it was doing it with a species that resembled werewolves was what had everyone confused.

The rocky II star system wasn't a very habitable place to begin with. They'd mostly made the larger, less dense, earth like as a ski resort while the solar hammers and dust scrapers made stuff.

The planet was an afterthought and while half the fleet really wanted to play melevelon creek for a few months just for the fun of it Admiral Casey had to put a lid on it.

The wider galaxy doesn't need more things to fear humans over when they already don't like all the crap we already do.

But it was hard to also reign in the rogue elements. Tugs had to keep remooring several dozen ships that were constantly trying to fly out for 'boops'. Those were slippery bastards because unlike the other side, they wanted to go off into space rather than set up mass cloning and entanglement facilities planet side.

""Respawns were a mistake."" Was a phrase barely heard under the din of shifting odds and crackle of settling rules.

It took almost an hour but in the end the admiral had her messenger, one ship by the name of ""Fox 4"" carrying her counter proposal of ""we like our planet, here we'll make another for you if you play nice"" with a big fat presentation on how that'd happen.

At my current job, I handle outreach for a small business, and we‚Äôre constantly testing send times to get better open rates. We export our unlimited/bulk leads from **Warpleads**, niche leads from **Apollo**, and verify everything with **Reoon**, so the data is solid. But despite optimizing everything else, open rates still fluctuate a lot depending on when we send.

We used to send emails first thing in the morning, thinking people check their inboxes while having coffee. Then we tested late afternoons, assuming they might be winding down and more likely to open emails. The weirdest thing? Our best engagement so far has been around 10‚Äì11 AM, but I‚Äôve seen others swear by 6 PM or even weekends.

So now I‚Äôm curious, what‚Äôs been working for you? Is there a ‚Äúgolden hour,‚Äù or does it all depend on the audience?

Trying to lose weight can feel like being stuck on a **treadmill that only moves backward**.

You cut carbs, you hit the gym, you avoid the cookie aisle like it‚Äôs a crime scene‚Äîyet the scale refuses to budge. It‚Äôs frustrating, mentally exhausting, and, frankly, unfair.

So what if there was a **way to boost metabolism** without **giving up everything that makes life worth living**?

That‚Äôs the promise behind [PT Trim Fat Burn](https://theworldhealth.org/pttrimfatburn-official), a supplement claiming to **help burn fat faster** using a rare **Kenyan purple tea**.

The big question is‚Äîdoes it actually work, or is this just another **overhyped bottle of hope**?

Let‚Äôs crack open a bottle and find out ...

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** **PT Trim Fat Burn**
* **Category:** **Weight Loss Supplements**
* **Overall Verdict:** **4.8/5**

# How Does PT Trim Fat Burn Work?

The magic ingredient here is **purple tea extract**, which hails from the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It contains **GHG polyphenols**, compounds that are believed to **break down fat cells** while preserving lean muscle.

Unlike **green tea**, which is known for its **antioxidants**, **purple tea has additional compounds that may support fat loss**. Some studies suggest it‚Äôs even **more effective than green tea for weight loss**.

Other ingredients like **berberine, garcinia cambogia, and green tea extract** work alongside the **purple tea extract** to **help suppress cravings** and promote **natural fat-burning**. But does it actually deliver results?

# Effectiveness & Benefits

People looking for **natural fat burners that actually work** have likely tried a bit of everything. What makes **PT Trim Fat Burn** different is its **focus on polyphenols and fat metabolism** rather than high doses of caffeine.

The **best metabolism-boosting tea** should help with more than just calorie burning. **This formula also supports appetite control**, meaning you‚Äôre less likely to **snack your way into regret**. Some users claim to have lost inches without changing their diets too much.

While it‚Äôs not a **magic potion**, those who commit to using it consistently see **visible before and after results** over time. Of course, nothing replaces a **good diet and some form of movement**‚Äîeven if that‚Äôs just chasing your dog around the house.

# PT Trim Fat Burn vs. Green Tea Supplements ‚Äì Which is Better?

Since **green tea vs. purple tea** is a common debate in **weight loss supplements**, it‚Äôs worth comparing them. **Green tea** has been extensively studied for its **fat-burning properties**, thanks to its **catechins and caffeine content**.

**Purple tea, however, contains** [GHG polyphenols](https://theworldhealth.org/pttrimfatburn-official), which aren‚Äôt found in **green tea**. These compounds may **increase fat breakdown**, reduce **fat tissue thickness**, and promote lean muscle retention.

**Both teas have benefits**, but **purple tea‚Äôs unique compounds set it apart**.

If caffeine tends to **make you jittery**, **purple tea extract** might be a better option for **boosting metabolism without the crash**.

# Real Customer Reviews ‚Äì What Are People Saying?

A quick look at online feedback shows **a mix of success stories and the occasional complaint**. Some people report **before and after results**, claiming **stubborn fat started disappearing** after a few weeks.

Others say they felt **less hungry throughout the day**, which made **eating healthier much easier**. A few had **mild digestive discomfort**, but nothing serious.

Some **PT Trim Fat Burn complaints** come from users expecting overnight results. While it works **best with consistent use**, it‚Äôs **not going to make you drop 20 pounds in your sleep**.

# Personal Experience With PT Trim Fat Burn

My cousin **Rebecca** has always been a busy person‚Äîbetween raising two kids and running her own small bakery, she barely has time to sit down, let alone focus on weight loss.

Over the years, she tried everything from intermittent fasting to cutting carbs, but nothing seemed to stick.

With early mornings spent kneading dough and late nights juggling orders, she needed something that could **help regulate cravings and support metabolism** without requiring a complete lifestyle overhaul.

After [hearing about PT Trim Fat Burn](https://theworldhealth.org/pttrimfatburn-official), she decided to give it a shot. Within the first week, she noticed one immediate change: her constant **mid-afternoon hunger cravings** had started to fade.

Normally, she‚Äôd reach for a pastry or a sugary coffee to keep herself going, but this time, she felt satisfied for longer stretches.

By the third week, she started seeing the scale move‚Äînothing drastic, but her jeans fit looser, and she felt **less bloated by the end of the day**. The best part? No jittery caffeine crashes like some **fat-burning supplements** had caused in the past.

The only thing she didn‚Äôt love? The capsules had a faint herbal scent, which took some getting used to. She‚Äôs not big on **strong herbal flavors**, so she made sure to take them with a full glass of water.

That small quirk aside, she‚Äôs happy with the results and still takes **PT Trim Fat Burn** daily to help maintain her progress.

# Side Effects & Safety Concerns

Most people handle **PT Trim Fat Burn** just fine, but a few mention **mild side effects** like **headaches** or **stomach discomfort**.

**Garcinia cambogia** can cause **dizziness for some people**, especially if taken on an empty stomach. **Berberine** has been studied for its ability to **help regulate blood sugar**, but some users experience **mild nausea** when first starting.

If you have existing health concerns, it‚Äôs smart to check with a **doctor before trying any supplement**.

* **1 Bottle (30-day supply):** $89
* **3 Bottles (90-day supply):** $59 per bottle
