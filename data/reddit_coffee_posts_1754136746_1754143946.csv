1mfrgiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1mfrgiq/im_a_video_editor_and_i_have_never_coded_before/,I'm a video editor and I have never coded before,"but I had an idea for software that would help video editors and the entire production workflow. I jumped into Claude (because I knew Claude Code existed) to refine the idea. I got Claude Code up and running in an empty folder and now I have software that works. Kind of. Is it perfect? Of course not. Is it functional enough to demonstrate my idea to colleagues? For sure. Is a lot of the headache coming from me being unable to explain what I want to do? Definitely.

If you're coming from a software engineering background, which it seems like 99.9% of people in this sub are since I have almost no idea what most of the posts are talking about, I think I'm understanding some of your frustrations AND praises, but coming from a field entirely unrelated to coding, and this is absolutely incredible. I've been working on this for a few days between other work and taking care of kids and real life stuff, but getting from zero to where I am now would have taken a lot of money and a lot of time just a year ago. Now I did it with a Max subscription and a few hours of sitting in a cafe drinking way too much coffee.

Now the real question- when I can be done and sell this idea to Adobe or Blackmagic for a few million bucks? ",1,1754143765.0,ClaudeCode,0,1.0,False
1mfrg9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmyLynnBradley/comments/1mfrg9n/the_story_does_not_add_up_for_me/,The story does not add up for me.,"Let’s dissect this.

Dad wakes up at around 5:30 am sees Amy’s legs with her supposedly asleep on balcony after getting back at 3:30 am.

I don’t know about y’all but if I have had a few went to sleep there is no way I’m able to get up two hours plus later and go out functioning. Yes she was 23. There are reports she could drink. Maybe she could be functional. She already was not feeling good so why go meet Yellow. Even if Yellow told her “hey meet me here.” What did she use as an alarm to get back up?  If she was going for coffee etc why not just use the time you had to continue to sleep?

Furthermore, her telling Brad she was uncomfortable with Yellow and making a pass at her. 1) Why would she go out with him again and up to elevator 2) In 90s she was a lesbian and I know things were different but why wouldn’t she have woken Brad up to go back out 3) cruise room doors are hard they would have heard it slam even if she was quiet. No one else heard the noise the father did? 

If she was going to get off to the island why didn’t she just wait for her family if she was close to them and then split off once off the ship?

Now fast forward the FBI is saying there is no evidence she ever left the room. Even with all witnesses accounts? Have those people been interviewed in 27 years by FBI?

I think either a she jumped and that’s what woke the dad up. Maybe she weighed herself down or got dragged under the ship. She did write that message in a bottle as if it was like a foreshadowing of what happened. Was that a suicide note? 

Also, the dad’s story has changed over the years. Maybe he went out there and tried to talk to her on the balcony and anger took over with her being gay. Why wouldn’t he say what he wrote in the letter in the documentary? ",0,1754143746.0,AmyLynnBradley,0,0.5,False
1mfrfiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1mfrfiz/paying_off_guests_screwing_hosts/,"Paying off guests, screwing hosts","I had that horrible guest - the one that runs into a couple of things wrong, starts making a list, exaggerates, complains about every little thing and then tries to extort as much money as possible. There’s a predictable psychology around this type of Guest - I’ve been doing rental homes for 25 years.

Fellow Airbnb owners: the short story is if Airbnb tries to take 30% of your hard earned rent because of a lying or insatiable unreasonable guest, delist your house. If you need the income, don’t worry you can relist it once the argument is done so you’re only off-line for a day at most. There is a check box for the delisting reason, and it says  “Airbnb does not treat hosts fairly.” If they pull this crap on you, checking that option sends a strong message. It’s also helpful to tell your guest as they argue with you: “ I’m not concerned about your review of me because I took my house off Airbnb.” And if you have to relist your house with them because VRBO doesn’t bring you enough rent, don’t worry about what the guest is going to write about you. Make sure your public response is not emotional, shows empathy for the guests experience (even if they are exaggerating), and show that you’ve taken steps to avoid this in the future. Reasonable prospective guests will see through your psycho guest as they emotionally rant on and on.

Fellow travelers, hey look! Just find one inconvenience per night and you’ll get 30% off your whole trip! Not!

My house is in Hilton Head, it has a gorgeous pool, on the golf course,  newly renovated, high end kitchen, beverage fridge near the pool, you name it. I give my guests shaving cream, 5-blade women’s razor, snacks for the kids, flavored coffee creamers, and more. Most people are thrilled with it. The guest right before and right after this Guest raved about how amazing the house was - same cleaning lady. When things go wrong, as they will, I overcompensate as you will see. I hate when this happens and I do everything in my power to mitigate.

My cleaning lady is terrible and I fired her. When reported, I offered the guest an additional cleaning (she said no, her kids were sleeping), when there was a stain on a blanket I doordashed a brand new one in hours. When she said there was glass in the outdoor shower I sent the window company (who had just replaced it) who said there were 2 tiny specs (and I had them there within 90 min - most of us and the average guest would just pick it up and move on - and assume a renter broke a beer bottle or something, rather than assume the host is wildly incompetent and their house is falling apart!). She said a man was in the house - well then why didn’t she call the cops? It was a lie - my pool guy went into the garage (which is locked off from renter access) and flipped the breaker - he’s 68 and quite harmless, and drives a van with POOL COMPANY plastered all over it. The latter lie was the initial basis for an outrageous $1,600 refund on a $5k stay. Again, gorgeous house, tricked out with amenities. When I use a rental house, and stumble on this or that, I just address it directly and enjoy my vacay unless it’s something major. After all, it’s a rental house. It’s never going to be perfect. And when the owner does a lot of special things I am very appreciative and more apt to ignore if other things go wrong.

The guest and I agreed on a return of the cleaning fee and it was documented in text. It would have gone out within 1 week of departure but my child was in the ICU on a ventilator- reasonable explanation, no???? I explained this to the guest and Airbnb, but she still rented on and on about how I ignored her. Plus 1 week is industry standard. You have 2.

Airbnb immediately initiates a 30% refund for the whole stay, and communicates it to the guest,
 without even asking my side. Um, shouldn’t they investigate before determining the amount of the refund?? Nope - they initiate “the 30% process” - it’s a thing - magic $$ amount that makes the guest giddy and Hosts don’t seem to fights too hard. There isn’t a fair assessment of a punishment that fits the crime, like which night are we refunding for, what went wrong and is it worthy of that substantial of a refund. And there’s absolutely no consideration for how the homeowner responded and whether the guest is being reasonable for still being mad after that. With 1600 bucks potentially going back into their bank account the guest’s eyes get big and they start throwing in things they never mentioned! No paper towels, not enough blankets so half the group were cold the first night (in the hot summer), and that man in the house who had them fearing for their lives (yet they never called the cops). 

Airbnb advocates HARD for the guest. This only happened to me 1 other time and they just ran it without reasonable justification and hit my bank account. You can’t even reject the charge like a credit card company because they are EFT-ing your rental income. This time I fought back vigorously. “No - please detail for me, for each night of 30% refund, the inconvenience the guest had which I did not address, and justification for that level of refund.” That’s where they kept coming up with new things to throw against the wall. They even tried this: “does your listing say that you have companies coming to service your pool?” My response: “Yes I have a servicing company, no I don’t have it in my listing because it’s a basic requirement like electricity, and so does every other homeowner in Hilton Head. I would think if you didn’t have a company servicing your pool that would be a bigger offense. And by the way, I just checked 5 Hilton Head listings and none of them mention that they have a pool company so you can’t hold me to a standard that you don’t hold other owners to. Then I asked: “ can you please point me to the policy you have regarding a 30% refund, and a grid that explains the types of offenses that warrant this level of refund? Also when did you ever alert me to the notion that I could lose this amount of money if I didn’t do X and Y?” I also said, “why are you even firing the guest up and fueling this story for the big refund when they agreed to a refund of the cleaning fee 3 days AFTER their departure? If it was THAT egregious they would never have agreed to a $375 refund, they would have called Airbnb right away,” and, “in the State of Colorado a verbal contract is binding, and I provided you hard proof of offer, acceptance and consideration.”

Then I pulled my listing off Airbnb as we had this argument. When they brought up the thing about the listing including a warning that I have a pool company, I pull my second house off and explained that if I could lose 30% of my hard earned rent over something that trivial, I’m not listing any house with them.

I said to the Airbnb agent, “do you really want to side with, reward, lying guests who are trying to cheat me out of rent I deserved for a service that was 95% delivered? And do you actually want to alienate a host that goes way out of their way for your guests and treats them like Gold? And you want to give up this massive revenue for two homes? Oh and by the way, my kids are traveling right now and there are three active Airbnb reservations in Europe. That’s another thing you’ll lose, I’ll just book them on VRBO, most homes are on both platforms.”

They eventually realized they had nothing tangible to substantiate the $1600 refund for three nights of inconvenience so they agreed to take $375 from me for the cleaning and they funded a 30% refund to the guest for the first night. ",0,1754143690.0,airbnb_hosts,1,0.33,False
1mfrfi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/timetravel/comments/1mfrfi6/time_travel_cant_be_real/,Time travel can't be real,"I had a dream that time travel was solved by applying Einstein's theories to vibration.  Essentially vibrating  molecules like a microwave does, to create relative speed, the whole thing was like the transporter in star trek.  So I don't think that is technologically possible but the thread isn't about the physics of it or the technology, I walk to show where my brain went next.

The first thing sent back in time over and over was a latte.  Yes, a milk-based coffee.  ""Why?"" You might ask.  The answer is because corporations took over the technology just like they did with the internet and ai and everything else.  So you can walk into a starbucks and order a latte and they just hand it to you.  They will make it later and send it back in time to the moment you ordered it, using the ""Microwave"" type device.  Since this is only a few minutes back the device doesn't need to be too far advanced and so its the first commercial application of the tech.

""Ok so what's the problem?"" You ask.  Great question.  Because every time a worker messes up and doesn't send back the latte it creates a break in space-time.  Possibly even splits the universe into a new dimension.  In movies the latte would just never appear but this is real life, people mess up, and there's no way to actually ensure that after the latte is received it is indeed sent back.  or that the correct one is made.

Once the technology is advanced, the corporations realize that they can use time travel to go back to say 5,000 years and use people for workers and then either just put the products into storage and wait or just time travel them back to the present or any other time.  So now you have this cross-time economy and also lawlessness because Corporations in the present are able to use slaves in the past.  The whole thing is universe splitting all over the place creating countless slaves throughout existence not to mention economic distortions and its all just a mess.

So the only way to deal with this is, you guessed it, a Time Commission.  Just like in Loki, Umbrella academy, Men in Black, etc.  This is the only logical answer.  Most of the corporate applications just can't be allowed and all the breaks in the timeline can't happen.  But the thing is the corporations always get control of their regulators and some amount of this is always going to leak through anyway.

So if you just reason this out from here you'll see it just can't happen. At least not in the sense of moving objects, people or physical matter through time.  ",1,1754143689.0,timetravel,0,1.0,False
1mfrezt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mfrezt/aitah_my_girlfriendf28_and_im32_have_been/,AITAH My girlfriend(F28) and I(M32) have been together 6 years.,"I rarely post here but feel I don’t have many outlets to discuss hard relationship issues, so I’m turning here. Thanks in advance. 

My girlfriend(F28) and I(M32) have been together 6 years. Mostly solid relationship with some ups and downs. The last year has been really tough we have been arguing more over silly things and then things escalate to bigger super unnecessary fights. We can usually solve it after some time but the can become drawn out over days depending on the situation. 
Around two months ago my partners mother was diagnosed with colon and liver cancer. Sounds like it was initially mostly treatable but you never know with cancer and now seems it’s spreading. This has been very hard on my girlfriend. Also she does really like to talk about things and will hold things in until she explodes. That has been the case here and she wants to keep all her feelings to her self. I’ve been quite respectful of that and not pushing to much to talk about the situation at all other than ask how her and her mom are doing once in a while. 

This morning we were having a conversation about our relationship and talking about our communication and how I was hoping we could have more opportunities to talk to each and get on the same/ talk about our relationship more openly and specifically. The conversation was actually going really well and we were both agreeing it would be great to talk more. This is when the conversation took a turn for the worst. I was talking about my family and how we never talk and I feel super distant from them and she said ‘well my family is your family’ i agreed as they are great to me. For some reason, I started talking about the relationship I have with her mom and I said ‘I feel sometimes your mom is not a big fan of me, and sometimes feels she doesn’t like me’ my partner said ‘maybe,  she is the type to not let things go’ and I said ‘I think sometimes I also get frustrated with her’ 
I don’t know why the conversation went here. It wasn’t something I really wanted to share but it just came out. Her reaction was huge. She immediately started crying hard. I realized what I said affected her deeply. I went to apologize and tried to give her a hug and she like ran from me. She was calling me all kinds of terrible names. Calling me evil and nasty and handful of other names. She said she she wants to move out at the end of our lease and more or less wants to break up. She doesn’t want me to stay at the apartment tonight either. 
I was profusely apologizing and felt super bad because I could see she was so hurt. She kept saying ‘how could you talk shit about my mom right now’ and I felt I really wasn’t trying to talk shit but I see how my words/timing were terrible. 
I know she is super emotional with everything going on with her mom. 

I don’t know how to proceed. I’m trying to give her space and I’m just sitting at coffee shop. How bad did I fuck up here? What should I do next? Looking for advice.

1mfr883,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mfr883/explore_the_best_indoor_tv_antenna_mohu_curve_and/,Explore the best indoor TV antenna Mohu Curve and is it worth it,"I've had the chance to test the Mohu CURVE indoor TV antenna extensively over the last few weeks, and it’s safe to say this product stirred up a mix of emotions—some great, some mildly frustrating. I’ve tinkered with antennas in the past, but this one’s unique balance of aesthetics and technology quickly caught my eye. “Elegantly contoured” might sound pretentious for a tech accessory, but hold it in your hands, and it just feels like a piece of modern art rather than an antenna. If you’re tired of clunky, unsightly antennas or you've had enough of unreliable cable signals, this sleek little gadget might be a game-changer.  

**Striking Design Befitting Modern Homes**  
Unlike those rabbit-ear atrocities of the past, this TV antenna boasts a warm grey design that blends harmoniously into a contemporary home setup. Placing it on my bookshelf, it almost faded into the decor. Its dimensions, 8.25 x 11.75 x 2.5 inches, mean it doesn’t hog any space, and the included antenna stand provides two choices: table placement or wall mounting. I stuck it on my living room table for testing—it drew zero side glances from the nosy neighbors when they popped by for coffee.  

[Check Mohu CURVE price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b0c6nf5gzp/)

**Outstanding Performance With a Catch**  
Performance is where I really got to scrutinize its capabilities. With its 60-mile range, I expected crystal-clear reception; for the most part, it delivered. Local UHF and Hi-VHF channels came through vividly, and experimenting with signal quality for UHD 4K and even NEXTGEN TV broadcasts was nothing short of fascinating. No Internet? No problem. The antenna pulled its weight without relying on WiFi. That said, the magic tends to falter if you’re slightly outside its stated range or live in an area with challenging signals.

**Pluses**  
- The multi-directional design makes placing the antenna less agonizing compared to competitors.  
- Comes with a high-performance 10 ft. coaxial cable, which means you’re not shoehorned into awkward positions for placement.  
- The Jolt Switch Amplifier is brilliant. Flip the switch when channels seem weak, and it works like a charm by boosting signal strength with 18 dB gains.  
 
**Flaws**  
- While multi-directional is impressive in theory, I noticed occasional signal dips when walls and furniture obstructed line of sight. It’s sensitive to its immediate surroundings.  
- Setup was hassle-free, but finding the right placement for optimal results could initially make your patience level plummet—expect some trial and error.  

**Who Should Use It?**  
This antenna caters perfectly to urban or semi-urban dwellers who want high-definition TV without coughing up cables’ inflated subscription fees. My sister-in-law, living in a residential neighborhood with decent broadcast towers nearby, had an easy time using it. However, rural users should tread carefully; performance deteriorated when I tested it in my uncle’s farmhouse situated farther out. Its advertised range, while decent, isn’t foolproof for everyone.

**Competitive Options**  
During my testing spree, I compared the Mohu CURVE with some worthy competitors, like the ClearStream Eclipse and Winegard FlatWave. The ClearStream impressed with easy placement flexibility due to its adhesive design but lacked the visual slickness of this product. Winegard’s FlatWave certainly delivered reliable 60-mile performance, yet I found its included cable far too short, making placement frustrating. What the Mohu CURVE stands out for is that Jolt Switch Amplifier—neither competitor had anything comparable, lending Mohu a distinct edge for those pesky fluctuating signals. 

**Value Proposition**  
It sits comfortably in a niche price point: not as pricey as some over-engineered alternatives nor as underwhelming as budget-friendly, throwaway options. The quality matches the price point perfectly. If good aesthetics and solid tech features make you swoon, this antenna won’t disappoint. That said, serious long-range users might want to explore more robust options tailored for their intensive needs.

Yesterday they were scheduled at 10 am. I was also at work so not on my phone. The only reason I really checked was to make sure they stopped at the post office to pay rent first. 

They ended up being almost an hour late due to oversleeping. As far as I know they didn’t have any repercussions at work. 

Today they’re scheduled for 10am again. It’s currently 9:55am & they’re still asleep. I woke up to their 8:45am alarm & started my day with cleaning since I’m off today. 

I feel bad because they could lose their job but I also don’t feel responsible for waking them up. I wake up at 6am for work on my own so another grown adult should be able to wake up at 9am for their 10am start time, even 9:30am at the latest since their job is a 10 minute walk from our residence.

1mfr6wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryGiftsf/comments/1mfr6wy/is_earning_money_a_myth_unmasking_the_truth/,"Is Earning Money a Myth? Unmasking the Truth Behind Hustles, ‘Secret Systems’, and the Elusive Treasure Map to Real Cash 💸✨","Okay, so tell me why does EVERYONE always say ""earn money,"" but literally no one agrees on HOW to actually do it? Like, what is the real deal here? I feel like every time I open my phone, someone’s shouting “be your own boss!” or “invest in this weird coin!” and the next guy is selling online fiction at https://goodnovel.org/. Honestly, I wish there was just one button called EARN MONEY NOW. Is that too much to ask? 😅

Let’s break this down:

- Do you get a regular 9-5 and grind through every Monday with your coffee, or…
- Do you try those hustle side gigs (online surveys, anyone??) and spend your afternoons wishing you picked literally anything else?
- Or are you the mysterious entrepreneur who claims to make thousands but is always “just about to tell us how” after we sign up for their webinar?  
- Then there’s the wild world of investing, which is either brilliant or “let’s see what the stock market dragon spits back at me today.”

Sometimes I feel like I’m watching a thousand different people dig for the same treasure, except some of them brought spoons and some brought jet-powered drills. How are you supposed to pick the tool when you don’t even know where—or WHAT—the treasure really is? It’s straight-up confusing.

Here’s the part that blows my mind: some people swear by the “passion economy,” like writing stories and selling them on, you guessed it, https://goodnovel.org/. Others are ALL ABOUT zero emotion, analyzing numbers, and trading until their eyes blur.

So, what’s the secret code, and do you have to be born into it or can anyone crack it? Like, can you just read enough tips, or hang out on enough subreddits, and suddenly…BOOM. Cash flow. Or is this all trial and error with way more error and a lot less actual trial?

- Do you have a system?  
- Are you building something for the future, or are you just collecting daily tips like a squirrel with an obsession?  
- Has anyone here ever just snapped, decided to try one of those story-writing things, published it on https://goodnovel.org/, and actually gotten a payout that feels life-changing? Or is that just a thing from YouTube ads?

Some days, earning money feels like stardust—super precious, totally beautiful, and always slipping through your hands before you can use it for anything cool.

What’s worked for you? What’s a total scam? Spill EVERYTHING. Have you found a routine that, even if it’s not glamorous, makes your bank account look a little less sad? Or are you still in the “throw digital spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks” phase?

Let’s swap stories and hacks. Because if someone out there really DID crack the code, I seriously hope they’re also handing out treasure maps. And if not, well, at least we can be confused together. 😅✨

1mfr65s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mfr65s/how_does_the_chulux_single_serve_coffee_maker/,How Does the CHULUX Single Serve Coffee Maker Compare for K Cup Fans?,"The CHULUX CL-KM807-W single-serve coffee maker instantly became a handy addition to my morning ritual. I often find myself rushing to get out the door, so having this compact coffee machine save me some precious minutes has been a game-changer. It's a slimline K-cup-compatible brewer that promises efficiency and simplicity, and, for the most part, it delivers. However, there are a few things to consider before making it your countertop companion.

**Compact Design for Space-Savers**  
The device truly lives up to its ""space-efficient"" promise, taking up merely 4 inches in width. It's the perfect fit for my overcrowded kitchen countertop, and even more ideal for smaller areas like dorms, apartment kitchens, or RVs. Its white finish gives it a classy touch, blending well with modern and minimalist home settings. With the ability to accommodate travel mugs up to 7.3 inches tall (after removing the drip tray), it feels as though the product was designed to suit busy, on-the-go coffee drinkers like me.

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
What impressed me most was its brewing speed. It heats water and brews your coffee at about 190°F in less than two minutes. On the days when I’m barely awake, these two minutes feel like a magic spell for survival. The energy-saving auto-shutoff feature is something I surely appreciate, particularly after having left appliances on in the past. It's efficient and doesn’t hog power, ticking a box for environmentally-conscious users.

**[Check CHULUX CL-KM807-W price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0db8dnfx2/)**  

**Customizable Brewing Options**  
I can adjust the coffee size from anywhere between 6 and 12 oz, which gives me flexibility on those groggy mornings when I either need a quick pick-me-up shot or a full mug to power through work. The water reservoir is a small 2-inch-deep area, which makes refilling straightforward without accidentally spilling water all over. However, this capacity means you must refill the reservoir for each use—a downside if you're someone who enjoys multiple cups throughout the day.

**Advantages**  
- Its compact size makes it perfect for small spaces.  
- The brewing speed is impressive, offering hot coffee fast.  
- Easy-to-remove drip tray allows for multiple mug sizes.  
- Energy-saving auto-shutoff is a thoughtful addition.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Requires frequent refilling as it only holds water for one brew at a time.  
- The machine can only be used at elevations below 4,000 feet, which eliminates usage for certain areas.  
- You may need some regular maintenance, like descaling every 1-2 months, depending on water quality.  

**Taste and Quality of the Brew**  
The coffee quality for a machine of this size and price is surprisingly good. It has a unique 4-hole needle feature that helps extract rich flavor and aroma, something I noticed particularly when using medium-roast pods. If you're a coffee connoisseur, you won't mistake it for a high-end espresso shot, but for the purposes of a quick single-serve brew, it's more than adequate. I also tried using a reusable coffee pod with my ground coffee, and the result was equally satisfying.

**Competing Brands**  
When compared with other compact coffee makers like the Keurig K-Mini, I’d say the host of features on this CHULUX model makes it a strong contender. The Keurig does offer a slightly more polished build and a quieter brewing process, but it comes at a higher price point. For budget-conscious users, the CHULUX coffee maker offers nearly the same functionality. However, the water refill requirement does create a slight disadvantage compared to competitors with larger reservoirs.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering its budget-friendly price, the product gives solid value. For someone like me, who balances cost and convenience, the CHULUX fills the gap nicely, offering the right blend of features without unnecessary bells and whistles. That said, the limited water reservoir capacity and elevation restriction might be deal breakers for some users. It's certainly affordable, but you’re paying for straightforward coffee functionality rather than flashy innovations.

Having spent weeks with the Samsung QN55LS03BAFXZA, or as it's more poetically called, ""The Frame,"" I must say it feels like an artistic revolution rather than just a television. What captured my attention originally was the concept of blending art with cutting-edge QLED technology, and yes, it does have its fair share of hits and a few quirks. Here’s everything I’ve gleaned about this device during my time using it.

**Art Mode: A Gallery at Your Fingertips**

Something about turning off a TV and having a beautiful museum-like display on the wall instead of a big, dark screen feels downright sophisticated. Art Mode on this QLED TV is a showstopper. With a motion sensor built in, it detects when someone’s around and shows off art from Samsung’s Art Store or even images from my own collection, but only when I’m in the room. My kids loved customizing the gallery with family portraits, while I dived into more curated galleries like Van Gogh’s. However, keep in mind that the Art Store offers a subscription, so accessing the vast library of art comes with a recurring cost. Without it, you can still upload your favorite pieces, but it feels like getting a sports car without its turbo boost.

[Grab Samsung QN55LS03BAFXZA at the best price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b09vcvgh7b/)

**Immersive Picture with Quantum HDR & Color Accuracy**

The performance is where this TV thrives. The Quantum Dot technology delivers breathtakingly vivid colors at 100% color volume. I streamed a few 4K nature documentaries, and the colors looked more vibrant than I’ve seen on comparable TVs. Quantum HDR also does an excellent job enhancing contrasts—dark shadows felt richer while whites popped off the screen. That said, while watching late-night movies, I noticed occasional blooming in super-high contrast scenes, but it was mild enough not to disrupt the overall experience.

**Anti-Reflection Matte Screen**

Let’s talk about glare, or rather, the lack of it. A huge selling point for this display is the Anti-Reflection Matte finish, and it’s truly a game-changer. My living room has these overzealous afternoon sunbeams, but for once, they didn’t reduce every bright scene to a mirrored blur. Whether it was morning coffee news or evening streaming, the screen looked stunning—free of distractions.

**Customizable Bezel: Because Details Matter**

What adds a touch of personality is the magnetic customizable bezel. My wife liked swapping between colors depending on the mood of our living room décor. The frame blends into the space convincingly, almost like a real picture frame. It’s worth noting that if you plan to explore all the bezel options, they’re sold separately, so don’t expect too much variety right out of the box.

**Slim Fit Wall Mount: Minimalism at Its Best**

The Slim Fit Wall Mount deserves its kudos. It lets you install the TV flush against the wall, creating that authentic art illusion. As someone who’s struggled with bulky mounts and cords clumsily hanging around, the One Invisible Connection cable bundled with the setup reduced clutter to a single, streamlined connection. Hanging it wasn’t a Herculean task either, though if your wall is crooked, you might notice a tiny gap.

**Positives**

- Stunning Art Mode transforms your space creatively.
- Quantum Dot technology provides rich and vivid visuals.
- Anti-Reflection coating minimizes glare, great for bright spaces.
- Slim wall mounting adds an aesthetic touch to the overall look.
- Customizable bezel options let you adapt its appearance to your style.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Blooming in high-contrast scenes can sometimes be noticeable.
- Bezel purchase is an extra cost, and not everyone’s favorite thing to deal with.
- Subscription cost for accessing the full Samsung Art Store might not appeal to all users.

**Competing Products**

Comparing this QLED TV to options like LG’s OLED TVs or the Sony Bravia series, there’s a clear choice depending on your priorities. LG’s OLED sets perform better in true black levels and cinematic viewing conditions, especially in darker rooms, but they lack the artistic adaptability of this frame-style television. Sony Bravia, on the other hand, often boasts better motion handling, but it doesn’t merge seamlessly into home décor. The Frame wins for its aesthetic versatility, though audiophiles might seek an external sound system for better audio depth compared to its competitors.

**Price Worthiness**

It’s not the cheapest TV you’ll stumble upon, but when you factor in its design elegance, museum-quality art integration, and solid picture performance, I’d argue it’s worth splurging for the experience. If you’re someone who values aesthetics alongside tech, this TV justifies its cost adequately. Don’t expect unrivaled performance for every cinematic nuance—it’s really an amalgamation of functionality and art.

1mfr28r,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1mfr28r/experience_the_best_budget_laptop_hp_laptop_and/,Experience the best budget laptop HP Laptop and see if it delivers,"Testing out the HP Laptop model, I found myself in an unexpectedly refreshing position—one that blends decent performance with a lightweight design, ideal for everyday tasks. Powered by the Intel Celeron N4120 processor, this laptop packs four cores and supports up to 2.6 GHz burst speed. My experience flipping between document editing, emails, light browsing, and even some streaming went smoother than anticipated. If the goal is tackling straightforward work or school assignments, it gets the job done without making me feel like throwing it across the room out of frustration.

**Design and Display**  
Before diving deeper, the physical design grabbed my attention. The silver finish gives a clean, professional vibe, making it equally at home in a coffee shop or an office meeting room. It’s slim at 0.7 inches thick and tips the scales at around 3 lbs—light enough to toss into a bag without a second thought. The 15.6-inch LED display is what you’d expect: serviceable with decent colors but limited by its 1366x768 resolution. It’s not retina-bitingly sharp, but it delivers a solidly usable screen for writing or watching casual YouTube videos late at night.

**Keyboard and Ports**  
Typing on the full-size keyboard quickly became one of my favorite aspects. With a numeric keypad included, crunching numbers or entering data felt fluid, even if the keystrokes are slightly on the shallow side for my taste. There’s a solid lineup of ports, too: one USB Type-C, two USB Type-A, HDMI, an SD card slot, and a headphone/microphone jack. This array covers the basics, although the inability of the Type-C port to handle charging or external monitors feels like a slightly missed opportunity.

[Check HP Laptop price on Amazon.](https://ultimateprinter.com/p/b0f9bchtyp/)

**Performance Merits**  
What stood out most in my use was its consistent performance for light tasks. The 16GB DDR4 RAM ensures multitasking isn’t a painful affair. I tested running a dozen tabs while writing, and only rarely did I notice hiccups. The 256GB SSD keeps boot times brisk, and file transfers are as painless as they come at this price point. Windows 11 Pro runs quickly here, with its polished interface and upgraded security features complementing the hardware nicely. This is not a gaming laptop or intended for heavy-duty video editing, so temper your expectations.

Some upsides I noticed:  
- Compact and lightweight design makes it portable.  
- Decent multitasking capabilities with 16GB DDR4 RAM.  
- Numerous ports for versatile connectivity.  
- Microsoft 365 included for a year adds significant productivity tools.

**Audio Drawbacks**  
The integrated dual speakers leave much to be desired. Their sound lacks richness, making them a letdown during Zoom calls or music listening. While clear enough for basic functions, expect to rely on headphones most of the time. It’s a shame, especially since a better audio experience would elevate the overall usability.

Here are a few less favorable aspects:  
- Display resolution feels dated with only 1366x768 pixels.  
- The Type-C port doesn’t support charging.  
- Mediocre audio performance from built-in speakers.

**Rival Brands in the Game**  
Comparing this machine to some contenders like the Acer Aspire 5 or Lenovo IdeaPad 3 puts things into perspective. While the HP Laptop boasts better multitasking due to its 16GB RAM, the Aspire excels with its sharper 1080p display. Lenovo’s IdeaPad slightly edges ahead in terms of audio performance. For portable workstations under a reasonable budget, this HP provides a solid middle ground, prioritizing RAM and storage over advanced graphical or audio capabilities.

**Value Proposition**  
Balancing cost against the features, this unit proves to be worth every penny for those needing a straightforward Windows experience for personal, student, or basic work use. Competing models may offer sharper visuals or better sound, but if multitasking and storage speed are your priorities, this product justifies itself. Without doubt, it mixes affordability with decent practical specs.

1mfqw3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mfqw3y/thalasson_humanitys_last_island_prologue_2_a_hfy/,Thalasson – Humanity’s Last Island. Prologue 2. A HFY Science Fantasy Isekai.,"Thalasson - Prologue 2 - A desperate War 2 - *The Sea Pearl can do little to resist the Air-Attack and the Legion Battlecruiser. Will she survive?*

""Fire!"" someone shouted from the front.

A shield mage stepped forward and used a water spell to extinguish the blaze, but the damaged sails he could not restore.

""The second group is preparing to attack again!"" Milda warned.

""How close is the Legion battlecruiser?"" Alea asked.

""Estimated time until they catch us—maybe half an hour. But due to the damage to the sails, we're getting slower and slower,"" Lobo warned.

Once more, a group of five enemy winged flyers approached. Each had a small mana cannon mounted on its nose, slightly rotatable. Behind the flapping wings on each side, they carried firebombs. The ten flyers alternated between low-altitude bombings and cannon fire.

Like many elves, Alea had hybrid training—both in magic and combat skills. As a half-elf, her human heritage gave her a larger mana reserve than most non-human elven mages. She also tended to learn magic more quickly. If anyone could shoot down a flyer with their own magic, it was her.

She turned and faced the incoming group of flyers, which raked the side and midship of the *Sea Pearl* with their attacks. The wood was already charred. Burnt corpses lay around, and the shield mages were nearly out of mana. They had spent it all repelling the flyers and containing the damage.

Only Alea and Milda still had mana left. But the mana of commanding officers was always the iron reserve-for when nothing else was possible. The final reserve.

*Alea believed the moment had come to use her power.*

The enemy flyers had already been hit by arrows and projectiles. Since the lower structure of the flyers was made of grotesque, misshapen flesh—somehow held together and serving as a base for the metallic wings and other structures—the hits had weakened them. From some of them, black artificial blood dripped.

Alea reached deep within herself and cast the spell:

""Overcharged Advanced Lightning Magic: Lightning Projectiles.""  
Four glowing orbs materialized just as the five flyers launched another low-altitude assault. She fired the projectiles at high speed. They detonated with great force and intense discharge between the five flyers. Lightning discharges engulfing the flyers especially those in the middle.

The three flyers in the middle began to spiral and instantly crashed into the sea. The other two recovered after a moment of stutter and paralysos and regained altitude.

By now, the attackers surely knew that either a half-elf or a powerful ancient mage was on board. Advanced spells were no joke—especially not overcharged advanced spells. The magic system of this world new basic, advanced, complex and legendary spell levels. Though only the most ancient and accomplished mages could learn even complex spells and most of those had human blood flowing thourgh their veins. There was nobody known alive to be able to cast Legendary spells.

For a moment, the flyers pulled back and kept their distance from the *Sea Pearl*. Alea’s intervention had bought them some time.

She pulled a mana potion from her belt pouch and drank it completely. The potion would rapidly increase her mana regeneration. In half an hour, she’d have her full mana again. Until then, however, she wouldn't be able to cast such a spell again. In about fifteen minutes at the earliest, her regenerated mana combined with her remaining pool would be enough to strike again—if the flyers came back. the firing range of her spells was limited.

Milda looked at her, and for a moment, Alea thought she saw envy in her eyes.  
""Impressive, Captain. Your human half might just be our salvation.""

""It won’t save us from that monster, though."" Alea pointed at the approaching battlecruiser drawing ever closer.

""Gods, help us,"" she heard Lobo pray. At that moment, a message came through the mana-stone:  
""Storm spotted. South-southwest. Approaching quickly.""

""Lobo, can we reach the storm?""

""Only if we’re not roasted into crispy chicken by the firebombs first, Cap.""

As if on cue, the remaining seven flyers swooped in—still high above—and dropped more firebombs. Several marines on the forward midship were engulfed in flames. One sailor rolled on the deck, screaming and burning, trying to put out the fire.

Milda ran to the middeck to extinguish the flames with her magic. Just then, another firebomb struck beside her.

""Milda!"" Alea ran down to the middeck. The firebomb had not only engulfed Milda, but also set the main mast ablaze.

She saw Milda writhing on the deck, screaming, her face and hair on fire. ""Gyahhhhhh! Captain! Help!""

Fire. Fire was everywhere. A sailor fell from the rigging of the main mast, aflame, and plunged into the ocean. Hopefully, he was already dead - otherwise, he’d drown in agony.

Alea prepared to cast a water spell to help Milda—  
—but then she saw that the main sail was burning too.  
Without it, they wouldn’t escape the battlecruiser.

Tears welled in her eyes. Alea used her remaining mana to put out the fire on the sail.

Lobo jumped from the aft structure, tore off his shirt, and beat Milda’s face with it to smother the flames. A marine hauled up a bucket of seawater and poured it over Milda’s head. Saltwater on wounds was painful, surely - but perhaps less painful than burning alive.

Alea gasped, panic rising in her chest.  
""We’re all going to die here!""

A voice shouted from the main mast.  
""Incoming from the west! Wyverns!""

Alea fought back tears and returned to the rear deck. She saw Lobo take a healing potion from Milda’s pouch and pour it over her face. It wouldn’t be enough to fix all the damage—but it would keep her alive.  
What a shame they no longer had the legendary healing potions from ages past—those that could cure anything.

Alea grabbed the wheel, which Lobo had locked in place, turned it, and steered the *Sea Pearl* straight toward the storm.

In the sky, she saw five wyverns intercepting the last seven flyers and driving them back, the proud blue banners of Evora tied to the wyverns whipping in the wind.

The flyers had crews of only three, but the larger wyverns carried four crewmembers—meaning more firepower, more spells, and their signature fireball breath, which the eyverns used instead of mana cannons. Wyverns weren’t outfitted with those.

The flyers withdrew, retreating toward the battlecruiser - buying the *Sea Pearl* the breathing room it so desperately needed.

The wyverns wouldn’t be able to seriously damage the battlecruiser - that monstrous thing of dark steel, armed with its three twin mana-turrets. But they could scare off the flyers.

Alea held course until Lobo returned, then stepped back to the mana speaking stone.  
""Everyone prepare yourselves. We’re heading into the storm!""

It was a massive storm. Mana fragments could be seen flickering through the clouds. Gigantic lightning strikes and deafening thunder.

It was the kind of storm that could sink a galleon.

And *certainly* a damaged one.

But they had no other choice. The battlecruiser would never give up the chase - unless the storm stopped it. Even the Legion couldn’t pursue or fight inside such weather.

Waves of black water, dark clouds, and a torrential downpour surrounded the wounded *Sea Pearl*... And the wyvern riders would later report to the admirals that the last thing they saw of the *Sea Pearl*  
was it vanishing into the big  storm - without a trace.

Dark water and the hand of the gods had claimed the dying ship.

Context: Hi all, manghihingi sana ako ng mga lugar na pwede namin puntahan around Manila para sa unang meet up namin after a long time & tips na rin since first time ko to.

So kaka-birthday lang ng long time crush ko for 7 years last month, and doon na ko nagka-lakas ng loob para yayain siya magkape just to meet her. Last time na nagkita kami is 2020 pa and wala kaming constant communication, binabati ko lang siya tuwing birthday niya or kung may special occasions. Since graduating na siya this August, yun nalang ginawa kong palusot para mayaya siyang magkape & pumayag naman siya thankfully! She's reviewing for boards these days & naka-dorm siya sa Manila, so it's fair to say na around Manila nalang yung loc para kahit papano malapit lang siya. For the record lang din, I'm NGSB & this is my first time na magyaya ng date so pasensya na kung manghihingi na rin ako ng tips hahahaha

Previous attempts: Planning to go for MOA para after mag coffee marami kaming choices kung anong pwede naming gawin after.

Feel free to give any recommendations even if hindi sa MOA & tips for me to be ready for our date. Thank you!",1,1754142225.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

1mfqujg,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1mfqujg/mil_in_rehab_for_partial_hip_replacement/,MIL in rehab for partial hip replacement,"My MIL is currently in a rehab after a broken hip and partial hip replacement.  She expects either myself, or more preferably, her son to visit all day every day.  I went up yesterday and stayed for about 4 hours.  I left  when her dinner was served.

She asked me, are you really going to leave me alone here?  My husband says she was kidding.  She was not.  She told me she would be coming home.  I told her she would NOT be coming home until she could care for herself by walking and doing her basic needs.  

I’m really trying to give my husband a break here, he is so stressed out, and he’s the only surviving child.  His father passed away several years ago.  His brother several years before that.  My husband’s been out of work for the past three weeks, and he returns to work Monday.  We told her that he went back to work on Wednesday so she would get used to not having him there everyday.  I went up on Wednesday and Friday as I have the ability to work from anywhere.  He’s going up today, (Saturday) and I’ll go up tomorrow.  I’m off Monday and will visit then, but Tuesday she’ll be on her own all day.  I will visit again on Wednesday.

I did tell my husband not to do the whole day, so he’s been weaning his time down.   She tells me she’s bored.  I tell her they have activities.  Bingo, parties, all kinds of crap going on.  I’ve brought her books, and crosswords, and magazines.  I don’t know what else to do with her, so I now do nothing.  I bring her a coffee when I come to visit.  I bring my laptop to work, and that’s it.  I chat with her if she’s feeling chatty, and if she doesn’t, I work.

The plan is that she will come home to her home.  We will have a chair lift and cameras installed, and she will have a home health aide during the day.  On the weekends my husband or I will come over to bring or make her some food.

What we are really struggling with is visitors.  She has friends that have visited several times, and even her neighbors have been there.  Cousins from California are calling and checking in on her.  Her grandkids though?  Nada.  Nothing.  Not visited her once.  I just saw an IG post that her grandson got engaged last week, and he hasn’t told her, nor has he called her.

My husband is pissed.  These kids are his brother’s kids, so my husband is their uncle.  They had these kids over all the time when they were younger.  They always wanted to come over.  They always took them out to eat or out shopping when they needed something.  Lent (gave) them money when they needed it.  Paid for baseball and football camps.  Now?  The only time one of them calls  is when they want money.  The other two don’t call at all.  She complains to them that they never call.  I told her that maybe that’s why they don’t call her.  Who wants to hear her complain every time they call?

Yes, she is an opinionated PITA, and for me she has been a MILFH.  I’m not sure if I’m really looking for anything besides just venting to the Reddit void.  While she’s a PITA, I still feel bad for her.",9,1754142122.0,motherinlawsfromhell,2,1.0,False

1mfqt4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeardAndTested/comments/1mfqt4f/explore_the_best_iced_coffee_maker_keurig_offers/,Explore the Best Iced Coffee Maker Keurig Offers and See If It Delivers,"Testing coffee makers is part of my daily routine, and the Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker has definitely caught my attention. Between its sleek design and dual functionality, it promises something for everyone. I approached the Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker with high hopes, especially being someone who alternates between hot coffee on cold mornings and iced coffee on warm afternoons. After getting my hands on it, I spent several weeks brewing cup after cup to see if it lived up to the hype.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker looks modern and stylish. Offered in an understated gray, it blends in well with most kitchen décor and doesn’t demand too much counter space. The removable drip tray, a thoughtful addition, can accommodate larger travel mugs and tumblers up to 7 inches tall. This feature is something I didn’t think I’d appreciate as much as I did, especially when I needed my coffee on the go. The 42oz water reservoir was another major plus for me, allowing multiple brews without the constant need for refilling. On a couple of occasions, I spilled water while trying to reattach the reservoir. It fits better with a bit of practice, but the connection mechanism isn’t entirely foolproof.  

**Brewing Options and Features**  
One of the highlights of this coffee maker is its ability to brew both hot and iced coffee. The machine intelligently adjusts the brew temperature to ensure full flavor extraction even for iced coffee, while also minimizing ice melt. After brewing iced coffee on a summer afternoon, I was pleasantly surprised by how bold the taste remained despite the slow dilution from ice. It also offers three cup sizes—8, 10, and 12 ounces—which caters nicely to different preferences. Personally, I found the smallest size perfect for moments when I wanted a stronger brew.

**Strong Brew Setting and Energy Efficiency**  
As someone who likes a kick from their coffee now and then, the strong brew feature became a lifesaver. It delivers a richer and more concentrated flavor. I noticed a slight improvement in taste quality here compared to my older coffee maker, which often produced weaker coffee even at higher settings. The energy-efficient auto-off feature impressed me too. It powers down the machine five minutes after brewing, which has been a small yet meaningful contribution to cutting down my electricity usage.  

**Ease of Use and Cleanup**  
Setting up and using this machine is straightforward. There’s no overwhelming control panel, just a series of simple buttons. Brewing hot coffee takes mere minutes, while iced coffee requires a slightly longer process to cool during the temperature adjustment phase, but nothing unbearable. The removable drip tray ensures any accidental spills are easy to clean. I tested the convenience of this tray on a particularly groggy morning when I overfilled my tumbler, and cleaning up was seamless. However, I did notice that the tray’s material felt less durable than expected; it doesn’t seem like it would withstand significant wear and tear over years of use.  

**Pluses**  
• Dual functionality for hot and iced coffee in one device.  
• Adjustable brew temperature delivers consistent flavor.  
• Three brewing sizes offer flexibility.  
• Energy-saving auto-off feature.  

**Critiques**  
• The removable water reservoir connection can be fussy.  
• Durability of the drip tray could improve.  

**Competing Products**  
I compared this with the Ninja DualBrew and the Nespresso Vertuo Next. Both alternatives offer impressive brewing features but cater to different preferences. The Ninja excels in versatility, offering both pod-based and ground coffee brewing, while the Nespresso is the go-to for those who prioritize quality espressos. The Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker, however, stands out for its sheer convenience and ability to seamlessly deliver iced and hot coffee at the touch of a button. Its focus on quick brewing edges out the slower lead times of these competitors, though the materials on the others feel generally sturdier.  

**Price Performance**  
Considering the range of features packed into this machine, it sits at a fair balance of quality and cost. It’s a good investment if convenience and dual-purpose design are high on your list. While some competing models might offer additional functionalities like compatibility with ground coffee in every setting, the Keurig’s focus on simplicity and speed makes it an excellent choice for busy individuals.

1mfqrd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mfqrd1/under_the_pile/,Under The Pile,"Sarah overlooked the children at first, but she heard the laughter and the giggles. A soft, tuneless murmur that drifted through the walls in the late afternoons, sometimes light and sometimes barely there, like something breathing just beneath the floorboards. It wasn’t unpleasant.

She’d moved into the apartment complex three weeks ago. A weathered little building with mismatched paint on the doors and a landlord who answered texts with emojis instead of words. But the rent was cheap, and her classes were just a fifteen-minute walk away. That was enough.

The neighbours, if they were home, kept to themselves. She only heard them in passing. For instance, a cupboard closing, the occasional tapping of feet as though someone paced the hallway, or even the sound of the elevator doors opening and closing.

That afternoon, she noticed two children standing outside her door. A girl in a yellow dress and a boy with curls falling into his eyes, twins. The hallway light flickered when they spoke, and Sarah almost laughed at how cinematic it felt.

“We live next door,” the girl said. “You’re the new one?”

Sarah hesitated. “Yeah. Apartment 6A.”

The boy didn’t say anything, just held tightly to a plush rabbit that looked like it had been washed too many times. His shoes were untied and worn vice-versa. The girl’s dress had a stain near the hem, like raspberry juice or watercolour paint.

“Our mum says we can go to the waterpark this weekend,” the girl went on. “You should come.”

She smiled, and Sarah felt something strange curl beneath her ribs. It reminded her of summers she spent with her mother flying her favourite kite.

“Maybe,” she said, “Do you like flying kites?”

“What is a kite?” the girl asked, moving closer to Sarah.

“I will show you when we visit the park.”

After that, the twins came often. Sometimes in the morning, waiting outside her door with questions that didn’t sound like questions. Sometimes in the afternoon, they would stand outside the building waiting for her to play with them. Sarah started getting snacks, and they began leaving drawings. A child’s sort of barter.

She never saw the parents. Not once, but the children always spoke of them from time to time, but not that much.

“*Mum’s cooking tonight*.” They would say.

“*Dad says we’re not allowed to go past the third floor.”*

*The kind of conversations you would have with eight-year-olds. However, they never spoke once about their favourite school teacher as if they never existed. Alina spoke as if she had never had friends; however, Drew spoke about a boy once, and never again. He did include him in one of his drawings, Carl.*

Sarah was taking out the trash when she saw them again. Alina and Drew were standing by the stairwell, like they’d been waiting for her. Alina smiled right away, but Drew didn’t look up. He was holding that stuffed rabbit again, the one with the long ears and the missing eye. His hoodie sleeves nearly covered his hands. On one foot, he wore a red sneaker, and on the other had a grey sock with a brown stain on the heel.

“You dropped something?” Sarah asked, trying to lighten up the mood.

Alina stepped forward, her eyes not leaving Sarah. “Drew dropped his shoe.”

“Oh no,” Sarah said. “Where’d it go?”

Alina tilted her chin upward, toward the small square window at the end of the. “It fell out. I think it went straight into the dumpster.”

Sarah kneeled to their level. “Oh no. We should go and get it,” she held out her hand, “Right?”

Drew didn’t answer, but Alina did. “Yes, we should.”

The pitch of her voice increased, holding onto Sarah’s hand.

“What about you, Drew?” she asked.

Drew's fingers tightened around the ear of the rabbit. Without saying a word, he walked closer to Sarah and held onto her cardigan.

“Amazing then,” Sarah said. “Let’s go get your shoe.”

“Wait, I just remembered something,” Alina said quickly. “The lid of the dumpster is too heavy. We tried, and it was buzzing too. Like it’s full of bees.”

Sarah raised an eyebrow. “Bees?”

Drew’s mouth pressed into a thin line.

“He’s afraid of them,” Alina whispered, like it was a secret too fragile for the hallway to hear.

“I’m not,” he mumbled. This was the first time Sarah heard him speak.

Sarah glanced at the trash bag in her hand. She was already heading down there anyway. “Okay,” she said. “Let’s go.”

Alina followed quickly. Drew stayed behind for a second, then walked after them. His sock made a soft sound against the floor. He didn’t say anything.

Outside, the dumpster was behind the building, under a tree that had lost most of its leaves. The lid was closed but wasn’t locked. Sarah grabbed the edge and pushed it open. It smelled worse than she expected. She could hear the buzzing sound from inside, followed by a shallow bang hitting the wall. She looked at the twins, covering her nose and mouth with the sleeve of her cardigan.

“Stand over there. Alina, protect your brother so that he won’t get stung by bees.”

Alina nodded, holding her brother onto her chest. Sarah moved closer to the dumpster, one step after the other. She could hear her heart throbbing as if she were anticipating the worst. With one blow, she nudged the lid open with her elbow and peered in.

Immediately, a swarm of flies escaped the dumpster, catching Sarah with immense surprise. Behind the flies were two bats, followed by four cats. She gestured her hand, trying to purify the air before throwing her trash out.

“Drew,” she called gently. “What colour was the shoe?”

He looked up for the first time, eyes wide and a little too still.

“Red,” he said. “With a star on the side.”

Sarah nodded, and there it was, sitting neatly on a flattened cereal box, right on top like someone had placed it there instead of tossed it.

“You’re a lucky one,” she said. “Almost like it was waiting for you.”

She reached in and grabbed it, brushing off some dirt that clung to the sole. “Here you go,” she said, handing it back.

Drew took it, but his hands were cold. Too cold for a sunny afternoon in March.

She opened her mouth to ask if he was okay, but Alina had already taken his hand again.

“Thank you,” she said sweetly. “We have to go now.”

Then, just like that, they were halfway across the parking lot, their shadows trailing behind them.

Sarah wiped her hands on her jeans. The smell from the dumpster still clinging to her. She stood there for a moment, unsure whether to go straight back upstairs or take a walk around the building first. The air felt better away from the dumpster, anyways.

Near the fence, something caught her eye. A stack of old newspapers had been left on the bench beside the maintenance door. Most were faded or water-damaged, but one was open and dry. She walked toward it, thinking maybe someone had been reading it on a break.

The headline was simple, printed in a box near the bottom,  
**Couple murdered in Apartment. Children still missing.**

She paused. The paper wasn’t dated, or maybe the top half had been torn off. The photo beneath the headline was black-and-white and slightly blurred. Two adults, a man with short hair and a woman with her hair tied neatly at the back, no children. Sarah flipped the page over and found nothing else about it. No follow-up, no names, nothing.

“Old news,” a voice said from behind her.

She turned and saw the janitor. She’d seen him before, early mornings, pushing a mop bucket through the lobby. He wore the same grey cap every day. The kind that never seemed to come off, even when it rained.

“Sorry,” Sarah said. “Was this yours?”

He shook his head. “Been sitting there all week. Kids sometimes bring junk from the bins. Half the stuff out here comes from people who never really left.”

She didn’t know what to say to that, so she nodded and looked back at the paper.

The janitor leaned against the bench. “You just moved in?”

“Yeah. Three weeks ago.”

He made a small sound in his throat. “That’s about when they start showing up.”

She looked up, unsure what he meant, but he was already walking off back to the side door with his gloves tucked in his back pocket.

She looked at the photo again. Something about the woman’s face felt familiar. She folded the page and slipped it into her back pocket, thinking maybe she’d read it later, when she had time.

As she turned to leave, she noticed something on the ground.

A small puddle had started to form near the dumpster. At first, she thought it was water, runoff from someone cleaning, but it was thick. It slid slowly from underneath the metal, moving in a line toward the fence, like it was following a crack in the pavement. She stared at it for a second. Then the wind picked up, tugging the edge of the paper sticking out of her pocket. Sarah walked away without checking twice.

Sarah was sitting on the floor, her laptop propped up against the coffee table. She had a half-written essay open and was halfway through typing a sentence when her phone buzzed again.

“Still not done?” Mia asked on the other end.

Sarah sighed. “No. I keep deleting things. It’s one of those prompts that looks easy until you actually start.”

“The one about moral responsibility?”

“Yeah. Which is ironic, because I’m seriously thinking about plagiarising now.”

Mia laughed. “You won’t. You’re too uptight.”

Sarah didn’t argue. She glanced at the time. It was almost six, and outside, the light had that washed-out look it got before the streetlamps came on. That’s when the knock came. Three soft taps, spaced too evenly to be casual.

“Hold on,” Sarah said into the phone.

She opened the door. Alina and Drew stood there, Alina with the same yellow dress and the same oversized hoodie. This time, the rabbit was missing. Drew was holding something else, an action figure or a little plastic soldier.

“Hi,” Alina said.

Sarah opened the door wider. “You can come in. I’m on a call, though.”

The twins stepped past her without hesitation and went straight to the living room. They dropped to the carpet and started sorting through the stack of crayons and colouring books she kept in the corner.

Mia was still talking. Something about her roommate stealing almond milk again. Sarah let her talk, half-listening and half typing.

It was quiet for a while. Just the soft scratch of crayons and the sound of Mia’s voice in her ear. Then something changed. The sound came in fast and loud. A scream, followed by a high, choked cry like someone was being dragged underwater. She could hear coughing or choking, like they couldn’t breathe. After that, someone started begging. The voice was scared and weak, like they were in pain.

Sarah stood up.

“Mia, hang on,” she said.

She walked into the living room.

The twins were standing at the window, side by side, looking out. They were laughing. Alina tilted her head back like something outside was funny. Drew was pointing, though his mouth didn’t move. Sarah looked outside but saw nothing. Just the parking lot, empty except for the usual cars.

Mia’s voice came through the phone, sharp now. “What the hell was that? Was someone screaming?”

“I don’t know,” Sarah said, trying to keep her voice steady. “I think it was the TV.”

“Sounded like it was in your room.”

Sarah didn’t answer. She stepped closer to the twins. Her eyes, glued onto their shadows on the floor that didn’t match what they were wearing. Drew’s silhouette showed him in shorts, not the hoodie. Alina’s shadow had no dress, it looked like she was wearing pants, and her hair was tied up instead of hanging loose. Sarah blinked. The shadows didn’t move the same either. Alina turned her head to the left, but the shadow turned right with a half-second delay.

“Sarah?” Mia said again. “You still there?”

She blinked again, looking down. The shadows were normal now.

“Yeah,” she said quickly. “Sorry. Thought I saw something weird.”

Mia kept talking. Sarah walked back to her laptop. She didn’t look at the twins again for the rest of the call.

Sarah didn’t remember falling asleep.

Her laptop hummed quietly, casting blue light across the coffee table. The crayons the twins had been using were scattered across the floor, but the children themselves were nowhere to be seen. The air felt heavier, humid like someone had left the shower running too long. Cold slid down her spine like fingers pressed to bone. When she opened her eyes again, the apartment had changed.

The walls were no longer hers. The off-white paint had changed to a sickly beige, stained with handprints, like something had been dragged along them. The furniture was unfamiliar. A sagging brown leather couch faced a wall with floral wallpaper curling at the edges. The light was dim, not just from the bulb but from the room itself, as if something had pressed all the colour out of it. She was standing now. In the hallway, she heard voices.

A door slammed, followed by the unmistakable sound of crying.

Two children ran past the entryway, Alina and Drew. Alina wore the same yellow dress, now torn at the sleeve and with the same red stain on the hem. Drew was barefoot, and tears smeared the dirt on his face. He clutched a battered rabbit to his chest, but the stuffing trailed behind him.

That’s when the father came. His name was never mentioned, but Sarah knew him. He was shouting, his shirt half-buttoned, damp with sweat, and in his hand he held an old ceramic lamp with a green base.

He turned, shouting something, and that’s when the other figure appeared from the doorway. A man with broad shoulders, head bowed as he entered, dragging something behind him. His jacket was soaked, the hem drooping onto the carpet. However, it was the **mask** that froze her.

It was stitched together crudely, like a child had made it. He said nothing, just moved forward. The father lunged, shattering the lamp. The man didn’t move like someone in a frenzy. He stepped forward like he *had all the time in the worl*d. He raised the blade and pushed it into the father’s chest. Again and again. Each thrust sounded hollow, like boots sinking into mud. The father’s eyes didn’t even have time to register the pain. He was gone before he hit the floor.

The mother appeared in the hallway, barefoot and panting. Her robe was open at the side, and she was whispering like she was trying to rewind time. She grabbed the twins, pulling them into a closet. Drew climbed in first, too dazed to protest. Alina followed, pushing him back and closing the doors behind them. From inside, Sarah could see through their eyes and now through the slats. They watched as their mother backed into the kitchen, fumbling for the phone on the wall. She pressed it to her ear, screaming, “Hello? Please…”

The masked man followed her in silence. From his pocket, he drew a belt. He didn’t strike her; instead, he stepped behind and looped the belt around her neck. Her scream cut off mid-word. Her heels scratched at the floor as her fingers clawed at the buckle. Her last look was toward the closet. She choked then fell.

Inside the wardrobe, Drew began to cry. Sarah, watching through Drew’s eyes, could feel the rabbit clenched in her arms, could feel his knees pressed to his chest. Alina tried to shush him, covering his mouth, but it was too late. The masked man was already standing outside. They couldn’t see his face, but they could hear the laboured breathing like he was sniffing for something.

He opened the wardrobe, and the light immediately hit their faces. Sarah wanted to scream, to run, but she couldn’t move. The man reached in, grabbed Alina by the hair, and dragged her out, her legs flagging. She didn’t cry but made a single, hollow sound that came from deep in her chest.

He left the wardrobe door open. Five months later, the landlady returned. She was tired of chasing the tenant, tired of unanswered calls and unpaid rent. This time, she came in person, her heels clicking on the cracked hallway tiles as she strode to the door of 6A.

She knocked sharply. “Ms. Linton! Rent’s overdue. You need to pay, or I’m turning this in.”

There was no answer. She knocked again, louder this time. She tried the handle, and it was locked. Her patience snapped. She pulled out her phone and dialled the police.

The officers arrived late afternoon, two of them, one younger and one older. They rang the bell, knocked on every nearby door, but no one came. The landlady led them to 6A, unlocked it with the spare key she kept for emergencies.

They stepped inside, and the smell hit them immediately. The walls had a greasy film, and the air was heavy.

“Jesus…” the younger cop muttered, pulling his collar up.

The older one shined his flashlight across the room. The living space was disordered, furniture tipped, broken shards of glass scattered on the floor. Faded stains darkened the carpet near the kitchen.

They found the bodies first: the father in the living room and the mother slumped in the kitchen, a dark belt looped tightly around her neck, skin bruised and mottled. Her eyes were open, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Outside, behind the building, the janitor heard a faint whimpering. He found her there, beneath the dumpster’s rusted metal, Alina. She was wet, shaking, and clutching one single shoe, the red sneaker Sarah had helped them find. The ambulance arrived and rushed her to the hospital. At the hospital, she was admitted directly to intensive care.

The police investigation was methodical and minimal. They photographed, documented, and filed. No arrests were made because of a lack of evidence. Their only witness, Alina, showed no signs of life, which made them lock the door and file a cold case. The apartment remained sealed. Its windows shuttered. Its halls emptied. The building continued without it.

Sarah woke, face pressed hard against the cold wood of her coffee table. Her fingers cramped, nails digging crescent moons into her palms. The laptop lay dark and dead. The crayons were scattered on the floor. Sarah sat up slowly. The silence in the room pressed in, heavier than any noise.

At first, she thought she was still dreaming. There was a drawing beneath her hand. She was certain it belonged to Alina, as her name was written on the far left corner. The strokes were harsh, uneven, pressed so deeply that they tore the paper. It was her, in a hospital bed. She was thin, with closed eyes, tubes in her arms, her birthmark visible on her temple, and wearing the same necklace she had on now. Next to the bed was a number, room 305.

Further, there was an address, repeated three times as if the drafter wanted her to understand and follow. She stared at it until her eyes dried out, then carefully folded it without realizing it, and called Mia. The hospital didn’t seem haunted. The walls were too clean and bright, and the flowers at the front desk were alive, placed in water. When Sarah told the nurse the room number, the nurse’s expression changed.

“Coma ward,” she said, as if it explained something. Room 305. Sarah heard herself breathing as she walked down the hall, each step sounding out of place. The door was open. Alina lay motionless beneath stiff white sheets, her hair unevenly trimmed, and her arms so thin they barely supported the IVs. Sarah stood there, her stomach twisting. It felt wrong, as if crying might break the atmosphere.

That’s when she saw it, a folded scrap of paper, half-covered between the mattress and the wall. She reached for it, unfolded it, and saw the crayon again. Five words,

""Tell the police to find my brother.""

She read it twice, then again. The police didn’t believe her, perhaps another girl with a saviour complex, a hallucination, an old wound trying to close, but Sarah persisted. She showed them the note, the address, the drawing, the dream that wasn’t a dream. She showed them Alina. Finally, a detective said, “We’ll check, but this doesn’t mean anything.” They returned to apartment 6A. The door was still stiff from being broken five months earlier. Dust covered the floor as if never been cleaned, and the air was heavy, as if the place had been waiting.

The officer moved slowly, checked the living room, kitchen, hallway, and finally, the bedroom. Nothing had changed, except for one thing, the closet. It had changed.

The officer had been in the room less than thirty seconds. They had already searched this place months ago, but the detective, the younger one with the buzz cut and the tight jaw, had insisted they do it again.

""Thoroughly this time,"" he said.

No one expected anything. He paused in the bedroom. The air was different here. He slowly opened the closet door. That’s when he saw the pile of clothes and blankets mashed together in the corner like they’d been shoved to cover something up. He crouched and pulled one layer back. There he was.

A boy, barely seven. Knees pulled to his chest, cheeks sunken, and eyes half-lidded but not open. He was so small he could have been mistaken for a doll. He still had the rabbit clutched to his chest with a hand that had dried to bone under the skin.

At that exact moment, halfway across the city in the white, humming stillness of a hospital room, Alina’s heart monitor flat-lined. Just like that. Her body simply let go. The nurses rushed in, shouting orders. A code was called, the crash cart wheeled, but nothing worked. She was gone. Her hand was curled loosely beside her. When Sarah entered the room seconds later, she noticed the difference immediately. The air had lightened.

One of the detectives had been on a call, and as soon as the call disconnected, he ordered the others to immediately make an arrest. Inside the closet, they found a paper drawn by Drew.

In a blue crayon were the words written,

“Mr Jackson took Alina.”

“Mr Jackson put his belt around mommy’s neck.”

“Mr Jackson killed daddy.”

Mr Jackson, the janitor, brutally murdered the small family. There had been a dispute about the father calling him out because Drew had mentioned how he had been touching him when they were alone. The cold case was finally brought to light, and the wondering souls were laid to rest.

Later, when the headlines faded and the apartment was cleared, Sarah found herself sitting at the park bench where she’d first promised to show Alina how to fly a kite. The air was quiet, and the grass had dried. No children ran past her. She thought back not just to the last few weeks, but every time they’d been here. It hit her all at once. There had never been other children. No games of tag around them, no parents watching from the sidelines. The twins had only played with her. Always just the three of them.

The drawings she kept were Alina's drawings, each one bore Sarah’s handwriting. She’d thought they were gifts. Now, they looked more like records, like messages. A trail left for her to follow. The strange way she’d seen through the closet slats, felt Drew’s breath, heard Alina’s thoughts, none of it had been a dream. It was as though she’d been placed inside Alina, puppeted through memory to relive what was never spoken aloud. She hadn't uncovered the truth; she'd been led there. Alina had shown her everything. Alina spoke through her to solve the case. She chose her.

1mfqrc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1mfqrc0/did_my_first_big_boy_a_v60_03/,Did my first big boy - a v60 03,"With an aged coffee (approximately 4 months old) light roast small lot chiapas from Trader Joes. Not to get too descriptive but I was thinking to make coffee for the fam this morning and no one other than myself is developing their palate for specialty coffee. That said - they still can detect a “very good cup” - which has always meant to me not nearly as bitter as the crap they drink (that is drowned in sugar and milk) from an inconsistent volume measure with an automatic dripper we have.

I broke out the 03 thinking it would be nice to ensure that I made enough for my wife and daughter. This is what I used as a recipe / technique:

- 40g of coffee, on the finer side of the pourover range
- 640g of water at 91C
1) 120g up to 45 seconds
     I did get in there and physically stirred the bed with a spoon
2, 3, 4 pours of 120g waiting between 10-15 seconds each
Last pour was 160
Gave it a swirl and tap
The draw down went somewhat long but it didn’t stall (went to around 345)

I don’t have the greatest thermal carafe. But after about 8-9 minutes and realizing my daughter was not going to be up? I had her cup while it didn’t move over to being flat out cold. And ya know something? I thought It made actually a pretty reasonable, pretty tasty brew. I could taste the flavor notes on the bag (the citrus punched through nicely). By far it was not my best or my best with this coffee. But maybe I am in the “80-85 range” of what I like to get from a cup. Definitely not bitter and not what my wife calls the ash tray taste.

What I don’t often see or hear about are folks working with the 03 size. Are you doing it? How would you adjust the recipe? Do people not mess with the larger size because of tunneling or under extractions?

M23 was dating F21. We met on our uni course and would go for coffee around our lectures on a Friday afternoon. We got on really well from the beginning and we hung out for longer each week. The 4th Friday we stayed out all evening and went back to hers and I stayed the night. 


In the morning she told me she wasn't looking for a relationship. She had just broken up with someone but she was questioning the whole idea  of bf/gf relationships. I just couldn't let her go and I said I wanted to keep on seeing her and she agreed. 


She kept me at arms length for a couple of weeks but we met up a couple of times and slept together. But things began to progress and we saw each other more. We hung out on other days at uni, went shopping, went on a double date, went on nights out and obviously slept together. 
 

She had a bit of a cold and I didn't see her as much for a few days. We slept together on a Friday and she said she didn't know if she would be well enough to go out the next night.


On Saturday I went to see a band with a friend and went to our usual club afterwards where my friendship group and hers were dancing together. I went over to her but she blanked me completely. There wasn't much i could do i so stayed dancing with the group and for the rest of the night she acted like I wasn't there.


At the end as we were waiting in a queue to leave she appeared in front of me looking all doe-eyed and smiling. I was angry and ended it (whatever it was) there and then.


I had the best romantic and sexual connection with this girl that I have ever had. As I've got older I've really regretted ending it. What would you have done in this situation? Was her behaviour bad enough to end it or should I have let it slide?


Note: I bumped into her a couple of weeks later and she told me she had slept with someone else so there was no question of me changing my mind at the time. She said a couple of more times that she didn't want a relationship but it did feel like it might have been heading that way. I spoke to her friend after it had ended and she said she thought we would have got together.

Coffee brewing is serious business in my household, and the idea of having a dedicated single-serve coffee maker for quick runs or condensed mornings seemed like a no-brainer. This little machine promised a lot in terms of convenience, portability, and functionality. Let’s dive into each aspect of my experience so far.

**Compact and Portable Design**  
One thing that stood out immediately about the coffee maker is its compactness. Its dimensions—8.9""D x 5""W x 9.7""H—let it squeeze into the tightest spots on my kitchen countertop. I’ve even tested it during a work trip where I camped out in a hotel room, and its lightweight body made it super easy to carry around. It fit snugly into my luggage without becoming a burden. The portability alone makes it an ideal companion for anyone who travels frequently or spends nights in RVs. Nobody wants to suffer through questionable motel coffee when you can BYOC (bring your own coffee)!  

[Check CHULUX LC-CM54802-BL price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dsbx6xb9/)  

**User-Friendly One-Button Operation**  
I genuinely appreciate its simplicity. The entire brewing process revolves around one button—no overwhelming options to navigate, which could frustrate users like my parents, who are not tech-savvy at all. I’ve used it to brew K-Cups as well as tea capsules. Quick add water, pop in your pod, press the button, and within minutes, you get a steaming hot cup of coffee. This convenience is absolutely perfect for those of us who hit the snooze button one too many times and need caffeine ASAP before the next Zoom meeting.  

**Unique 4-Hole Needle Feature**  
What sets this machine apart is its 4-hole outlet needle. Most single-serve brewers just opt for a single-hole needle. This thoughtful design ensures that water is evenly distributed, fully saturating the coffee grounds so you get a strong, balanced taste instead of diluted swill. I experimented with pods from different brands, and the balanced aroma with this machine is noticeably better compared to other compact brewers I’ve owned. The coffee itself is piping hot, which is impressive for something so compact.  

**Good Points**  
- The space-saving build makes it ideal for small apartments, dorms, or RVs.  
- One-button functionality simplifies the process, even for non-coffee enthusiasts.  
- The 4-hole needle system ensures consistent brewing quality.  

**Caveats**  
- The small water reservoir must be refilled for each brew, which may bother heavy coffee drinkers.  
- At altitudes over 6,000 feet, the machine doesn't brew effectively, which limits its use for mountain vacations.  

**Maintenance Tips**  
After a week of using this at least twice daily, I realized maintenance is crucial for keeping it in good shape. If you let limescale build up, the machine starts making strange noises, and the coffee flow slows down or even stops. I tried the recommended solution—vinegar water soaking—and it worked wonders. It’s worth adding a regular descaling routine to your calendar to avoid brewing disasters.  

**Competitive Options**  
When compared to other single-serve options like the Keurig K-Mini or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, this coffee maker stands out for its superior portability and lighter weight. The Keurig offers a bigger reservoir, so you’re not constantly refilling it, but it’s heavier and less travel-friendly. The Hamilton Beach model allows you to use loose coffee grounds in addition to pods, which gives it an edge in flexibility. However, it lacks the compact charm and simple one-button operation of the CHULUX brewer. For small spaces and quick setups, this product still nails its niche, even if it does have a few quirks.

**Price Performance**  
In terms of financial worth, this product nails a sweet spot. You’re not breaking the bank, and yet, you’re getting robust performance for everyday coffee and tea brewing. It’s hard to find machines this compact with a reliable shutoff feature and consistent brewing quality within this price bracket. Looking at its competitors, this stands out as a cost-effective option for lightweight, efficient brewing.

* If you're shuttling or camping, we are just over a mile down the road to the west of the festival; this is slightly further than last year, but with this year's forecasted cooler weather it should be an easier and nicer walk! Once you get to the covered bridge, you will have sidewalk accessible, but note that the first part of the walk does not have sidewalk. That said, with Hinterland traffic, the road is usually full of slower-moving vehicles, ATVs, and golf carts who are watching out for pedestrians

# Food & Drink

Our current everyday menu is [available on our website](https://www.tigerlilycafeia.com/menu), and we'll have additional items available just for Hinterland including gluten-free bread options, fruit cups, and more.

We sell ice cream from local Iowa shop The Outside Scoop that includes great to-go options like ice cream sandwiches and edible cookie dough! They will also have a truck over at Hinterland, so visit them and support local :)

Please note - advance/online ordering for pickup will **NOT** be available during Hinterland as we wouldn't be able to keep up with demand - so you'll need to come to the shop to order! Expect wait times to be around 10-20 minutes depending on how busy we are when you get to us.

# Local Music & Vendors

On Saturday, we'll have a couple of local food-related vendors, and I will be selling handmade crochet accessories including bucket hats, bandanas, bikini tops, and bags!

We will also have a local musician playing an acoustic set outside at the shop on Saturday morning.

# General Information

* Please keep in mind we are a family owned and operated business with a small team; we want to provide y'all with a great experience during your time here, but we will be handling a much bigger influx than we see most of the time!
* We'll fill up water bottles - if the water jug we keep out is empty, just come up to the counter and we'd be happy to fill it up and add some ice for you!
* We will have tents, chairs, and tables set up in front of the shop for additional shade and seating this year! Vendors will also be set up in front of and behind the shop (we have a patio out back with additional tables as well).
* Please respect St. Charles when you're visiting us; make sure to keep things clean and throw away garbage in provided receptacles

Its sleek ""Oatmilk"" matte finish complements almost any kitchen decor, a much-needed touch for someone like me who values both functionality and aesthetics in appliances. This coffee maker fits snugly on my limited counter space, thanks to its compact design—not something every coffee machine can boast. From small morning sips to larger travel mug fills, it quickly became part of my daily routine. However, it’s not a perfect machine, and there’s definitely some room for improvement.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The striking first impression of this compact coffee maker is its modern aesthetic and minimalistic finish. Measuring only 6.41 inches in depth and just over a foot in height, it’s small enough for cramped city apartments or a home office coffee corner. The adjustable drip tray is a clever design feature, accommodating mugs as tall as 7 inches. I mainly use my jumbo travel mug, and it slides in easily without hassle. There’s also a convenient cord tie, which avoids the annoyance of trailing cables tangling with other appliances. While the matte finish is undeniably stylish, it tends to collect smudges and fingerprints quite easily, which might bother some users who want their countertop looking pristine every day.

**Ease of Use**  
As someone who struggles with overly complicated gadgets before my morning coffee kicks in, the one-touch operation of this coffee maker is a lifesaver. Whether I wanted a quick 6oz wake-up shot or a full 14oz travel mug brew, the machine consistently delivered. The fact that it’s compatible with both coffee pods and ground coffee adds tremendous flexibility. I tested it with my favorite coffee pod flavors first, and a few days later, decided to switch things up with freshly ground beans. Both options worked perfectly, and the included reusable coffee grounds filter made cleanup much simpler than I’d expected.

**[Check BELLA 35126-043A price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0cyj6xt9s/)**

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
With 1000 watts of power behind it, this coffee maker quickly brews a piping hot cup of coffee, even on busy mornings. One feature I really appreciated was the auto shutoff—those rushed moments of running out the door sometimes leave you second-guessing whether you’ve turned off everything. The BELLA makes sure that’s never a concern. The brewing temperature felt just right, not too hot to burn my tongue but hot enough to savor the depth of flavor in my coffee. That said, while the coffee was flavorful, I noticed that it occasionally felt slightly weaker than what I get from drip coffee machines; this could vary depending on your preference for stronger or lighter cups.

**Positives**  
This small appliance packs in several advantageous features that make it stand out.  

- Compact design fits seamlessly in tight spaces.  
- Adjustable drip tray accommodates multiple mug sizes.  
- Efficient brewing in just a few minutes; great for hectic mornings.  
- Offers dual compatibility for using either coffee pods or ground coffee.  

**Caveats**  
While highly versatile, there are some less favorable aspects to note.  

- The matte finish, although elegant, is prone to showing smudges.  
- Brew strength might not satisfy those who like intensely strong coffee.  
- Larger mugs often require careful positioning to avoid spillage with the drip tray.  

**Product Competitors**  
There are many other single-serve coffee makers in this price range, but a comparison against Keurig K-Mini comes to mind. Both machines are compact and cater to personal servings, but the BELLA coffee maker wins when it comes to ground coffee compatibility without requiring an additional purchase. The K-Mini, however, seems to offer a slightly more robust brew strength and has a more polished finish that resists smudging much better. For someone looking for a balance between affordability and customization, the BELLA edges ahead, but coffee enthusiasts who prioritize brew intensity might lean toward Keurig models.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its sleek appearance and dual coffee brewing options, this coffee maker delivers solid value. Its performance is reliable for everyday use, particularly for anyone who needs their coffee quick without sacrificing too much on flavor. While it doesn’t execute the most barista-like cup of coffee, it justifies its purchase for its versatility and user-friendly features. If reasonably priced functionality is what you’re chasing, this compact machine is a smart investment.

Upon first injection of 150ug I definitely could tell that I took something, but over the day, I actually lost energy. I had side-effects.

I started researching & someone else on Reddit found that methyl donors are needed when we take SS-31.

I found this out by 2pm. Took them (because of course I have 1 million supplements from trying to solve my exhaustion) and by 5pm I noticed that I had been getting a lot of physical tasks done.

I had been motoring around & not feeling PEM!

At my worst - a task like washing dishes would take me out for 3 days. (Mentally taxing to follow a boring process because of my adhd & physically exhausting from standing so long).

I see a lot of posts with people having hit or miss results & wanted to share this.

This community has helped me so much. Good luck to you all.

* Methylcobalamin (B12)
* TMG (Betaine Anhydrous)
* NAD+ (I personally had the Renue brand NMN powder that you put under your tongue.)

**Context**

Diagnoses:

* Severe adhd from childhood
* POTS symptoms since ~12 years old. Never officially diagnosed.
* Diagnosed with cfs in 2017 after a sleep study showed no issues & my blood work has always been fine.
* Had Covid 4 times in 2022. Took all the vaccines from 2020/21.
* Through trial & error and finally validated by a Strategene genome report I figured out that my body has glutathione issues.

Through trialing hundreds of supps I found some help in liposomal glutathione under the tongue. (Only the bulletpr00f brand liposomal version works if I swallow the pill.)

This was the first thing that started making me feel better.

Then, I discovered glutamine & ribose (ribose needs Berberine added to prevent dementia risk). Both of these feel like what I think coffee does to “normal” people. Coffee puts me to sleep.

So far SS-31 feels better than those 2. It does feel like the energy is within & like it’s fixing something.

Fingers crossed that it helps my squirrelly adhd brain too!

Notes: yes, I’ve taken all the stimulants, low dose naltrexone, ssri’s and more.

Right now, I’m getting the most benefit from this peptide + glutathione.

I think from COVID after-effects (maybe Long Covid) I was trembling when standing. L-citrulline malate plus beet root powder helped that tremendously. I’ve since healed from whatever issue that was.",1,1754141499.0,Biohackers,3,0.67,False

**UNDER THE PILE**

Sarah overlooked the children at first, but she heard the laughter and the giggles. A soft, tuneless murmur that drifted through the walls in the late afternoons, sometimes light and sometimes barely there, like something breathing just beneath the floorboards. It wasn’t unpleasant.

She’d moved into the apartment complex three weeks ago. A weathered little building with mismatched paint on the doors and a landlord who answered texts with emojis instead of words. But the rent was cheap, and her classes were just a fifteen-minute walk away. That was enough.

The neighbours, if they were home, kept to themselves. She only heard them in passing. For instance, a cupboard closing, the occasional tapping of feet as though someone paced the hallway, or even the sound of the elevator doors opening and closing.

That afternoon, she noticed two children standing outside her door. A girl in a yellow dress and a boy with curls falling into his eyes, twins. The hallway light flickered when they spoke, and Sarah almost laughed at how cinematic it felt.

“We live next door,” the girl said. “You’re the new one?”

Sarah hesitated. “Yeah. Apartment 6A.”

The boy didn’t say anything, just held tightly to a plush rabbit that looked like it had been washed too many times. His shoes were untied and worn vice-versa. The girl’s dress had a stain near the hem, like raspberry juice or watercolour paint.

“Our mum says we can go to the waterpark this weekend,” the girl went on. “You should come.”

She smiled, and Sarah felt something strange curl beneath her ribs. It reminded her of summers she spent with her mother flying her favourite kite.

“Maybe,” she said, “Do you like flying kites?”

“What is a kite?” the girl asked, moving closer to Sarah.

“I will show you when we visit the park.”

After that, the twins came often. Sometimes in the morning, waiting outside her door with questions that didn’t sound like questions. Sometimes in the afternoon, they would stand outside the building waiting for her to play with them. Sarah started getting snacks, and they began leaving drawings. A child’s sort of barter.

She never saw the parents. Not once, but the children always spoke of them from time to time, but not that much.

“*Mum’s cooking tonight*.” They would say.

“*Dad says we’re not allowed to go past the third floor.”*

*The kind of conversations you would have with eight-year-olds. However, they never spoke once about their favourite school teacher as if they never existed. Alina spoke as if she had never had friends; however, Drew spoke about a boy once, and never again. He did include him in one of his drawings, Carl.*

Sarah was taking out the trash when she saw them again. Alina and Drew were standing by the stairwell, like they’d been waiting for her. Alina smiled right away, but Drew didn’t look up. He was holding that stuffed rabbit again, the one with the long ears and the missing eye. His hoodie sleeves nearly covered his hands. On one foot, he wore a red sneaker, and on the other had a grey sock with a brown stain on the heel.

“You dropped something?” Sarah asked, trying to lighten up the mood.

Alina stepped forward, her eyes not leaving Sarah. “Drew dropped his shoe.”

“Oh no,” Sarah said. “Where’d it go?”

Alina tilted her chin upward, toward the small square window at the end of the. “It fell out. I think it went straight into the dumpster.”

Sarah kneeled to their level. “Oh no. We should go and get it,” she held out her hand, “Right?”

Drew didn’t answer, but Alina did. “Yes, we should.”

The pitch of her voice increased, holding onto Sarah’s hand.

“What about you, Drew?” she asked.

Drew's fingers tightened around the ear of the rabbit. Without saying a word, he walked closer to Sarah and held onto her cardigan.

“Amazing then,” Sarah said. “Let’s go get your shoe.”

“Wait, I just remembered something,” Alina said quickly. “The lid of the dumpster is too heavy. We tried, and it was buzzing too. Like it’s full of bees.”

Sarah raised an eyebrow. “Bees?”

Drew’s mouth pressed into a thin line.

“He’s afraid of them,” Alina whispered, like it was a secret too fragile for the hallway to hear.

“I’m not,” he mumbled. This was the first time Sarah heard him speak.

Sarah glanced at the trash bag in her hand. She was already heading down there anyway. “Okay,” she said. “Let’s go.”

Alina followed quickly. Drew stayed behind for a second, then walked after them. His sock made a soft sound against the floor. He didn’t say anything.

Outside, the dumpster was behind the building, under a tree that had lost most of its leaves. The lid was closed but wasn’t locked. Sarah grabbed the edge and pushed it open. It smelled worse than she expected. She could hear the buzzing sound from inside, followed by a shallow bang hitting the wall. She looked at the twins, covering her nose and mouth with the sleeve of her cardigan.

“Stand over there. Alina, protect your brother so that he won’t get stung by bees.”

Alina nodded, holding her brother onto her chest. Sarah moved closer to the dumpster, one step after the other. She could hear her heart throbbing as if she were anticipating the worst. With one blow, she nudged the lid open with her elbow and peered in.

Immediately, a swarm of flies escaped the dumpster, catching Sarah with immense surprise. Behind the flies were two bats, followed by four cats. She gestured her hand, trying to purify the air before throwing her trash out.

“Drew,” she called gently. “What colour was the shoe?”

He looked up for the first time, eyes wide and a little too still.

“Red,” he said. “With a star on the side.”

Sarah nodded, and there it was, sitting neatly on a flattened cereal box, right on top like someone had placed it there instead of tossed it.

“You’re a lucky one,” she said. “Almost like it was waiting for you.”

She reached in and grabbed it, brushing off some dirt that clung to the sole. “Here you go,” she said, handing it back.

Drew took it, but his hands were cold. Too cold for a sunny afternoon in March.

She opened her mouth to ask if he was okay, but Alina had already taken his hand again.

“Thank you,” she said sweetly. “We have to go now.”

Then, just like that, they were halfway across the parking lot, their shadows trailing behind them.

Sarah wiped her hands on her jeans. The smell from the dumpster still clinging to her. She stood there for a moment, unsure whether to go straight back upstairs or take a walk around the building first. The air felt better away from the dumpster, anyways.

Near the fence, something caught her eye. A stack of old newspapers had been left on the bench beside the maintenance door. Most were faded or water-damaged, but one was open and dry. She walked toward it, thinking maybe someone had been reading it on a break.

The headline was simple, printed in a box near the bottom,  
**Couple murdered in Apartment. Children still missing.**

She paused. The paper wasn’t dated, or maybe the top half had been torn off. The photo beneath the headline was black-and-white and slightly blurred. Two adults, a man with short hair and a woman with her hair tied neatly at the back, no children. Sarah flipped the page over and found nothing else about it. No follow-up, no names, nothing.

“Old news,” a voice said from behind her.

She turned and saw the janitor. She’d seen him before, early mornings, pushing a mop bucket through the lobby. He wore the same grey cap every day. The kind that never seemed to come off, even when it rained.

“Sorry,” Sarah said. “Was this yours?”

He shook his head. “Been sitting there all week. Kids sometimes bring junk from the bins. Half the stuff out here comes from people who never really left.”

She didn’t know what to say to that, so she nodded and looked back at the paper.

The janitor leaned against the bench. “You just moved in?”

“Yeah. Three weeks ago.”

He made a small sound in his throat. “That’s about when they start showing up.”

She looked up, unsure what he meant, but he was already walking off back to the side door with his gloves tucked in his back pocket.

She looked at the photo again. Something about the woman’s face felt familiar. She folded the page and slipped it into her back pocket, thinking maybe she’d read it later, when she had time.

As she turned to leave, she noticed something on the ground.

A small puddle had started to form near the dumpster. At first, she thought it was water, runoff from someone cleaning, but it was thick. It slid slowly from underneath the metal, moving in a line toward the fence, like it was following a crack in the pavement. She stared at it for a second. Then the wind picked up, tugging the edge of the paper sticking out of her pocket. Sarah walked away without checking twice.

Sarah was sitting on the floor, her laptop propped up against the coffee table. She had a half-written essay open and was halfway through typing a sentence when her phone buzzed again.

“Still not done?” Mia asked on the other end.

Sarah sighed. “No. I keep deleting things. It’s one of those prompts that looks easy until you actually start.”

“The one about moral responsibility?”

“Yeah. Which is ironic, because I’m seriously thinking about plagiarising now.”

Mia laughed. “You won’t. You’re too uptight.”

Sarah didn’t argue. She glanced at the time. It was almost six, and outside, the light had that washed-out look it got before the streetlamps came on. That’s when the knock came. Three soft taps, spaced too evenly to be casual.

“Hold on,” Sarah said into the phone.

She opened the door. Alina and Drew stood there, Alina with the same yellow dress and the same oversized hoodie. This time, the rabbit was missing. Drew was holding something else, an action figure or a little plastic soldier.

“Hi,” Alina said.

Sarah opened the door wider. “You can come in. I’m on a call, though.”

The twins stepped past her without hesitation and went straight to the living room. They dropped to the carpet and started sorting through the stack of crayons and colouring books she kept in the corner.

Mia was still talking. Something about her roommate stealing almond milk again. Sarah let her talk, half-listening and half typing.

It was quiet for a while. Just the soft scratch of crayons and the sound of Mia’s voice in her ear. Then something changed. The sound came in fast and loud. A scream, followed by a high, choked cry like someone was being dragged underwater. She could hear coughing or choking, like they couldn’t breathe. After that, someone started begging. The voice was scared and weak, like they were in pain.

Sarah stood up.

“Mia, hang on,” she said.

She walked into the living room.

The twins were standing at the window, side by side, looking out. They were laughing. Alina tilted her head back like something outside was funny. Drew was pointing, though his mouth didn’t move. Sarah looked outside but saw nothing. Just the parking lot, empty except for the usual cars.

Mia’s voice came through the phone, sharp now. “What the hell was that? Was someone screaming?”

“I don’t know,” Sarah said, trying to keep her voice steady. “I think it was the TV.”

“Sounded like it was in your room.”

Sarah didn’t answer. She stepped closer to the twins. Her eyes, glued onto their shadows on the floor that didn’t match what they were wearing. Drew’s silhouette showed him in shorts, not the hoodie. Alina’s shadow had no dress, it looked like she was wearing pants, and her hair was tied up instead of hanging loose. Sarah blinked. The shadows didn’t move the same either. Alina turned her head to the left, but the shadow turned right with a half-second delay.

“Sarah?” Mia said again. “You still there?”

She blinked again, looking down. The shadows were normal now.

“Yeah,” she said quickly. “Sorry. Thought I saw something weird.”

Mia kept talking. Sarah walked back to her laptop. She didn’t look at the twins again for the rest of the call.

Sarah didn’t remember falling asleep.

Her laptop hummed quietly, casting blue light across the coffee table. The crayons the twins had been using were scattered across the floor, but the children themselves were nowhere to be seen. The air felt heavier, humid like someone had left the shower running too long. Cold slid down her spine like fingers pressed to bone. When she opened her eyes again, the apartment had changed.

The walls were no longer hers. The off-white paint had changed to a sickly beige, stained with handprints, like something had been dragged along them. The furniture was unfamiliar. A sagging brown leather couch faced a wall with floral wallpaper curling at the edges. The light was dim, not just from the bulb but from the room itself, as if something had pressed all the colour out of it. She was standing now. In the hallway, she heard voices.

A door slammed, followed by the unmistakable sound of crying.

Two children ran past the entryway, Alina and Drew. Alina wore the same yellow dress, now torn at the sleeve and with the same red stain on the hem. Drew was barefoot, and tears smeared the dirt on his face. He clutched a battered rabbit to his chest, but the stuffing trailed behind him.

That’s when the father came. His name was never mentioned, but Sarah knew him. He was shouting, his shirt half-buttoned, damp with sweat, and in his hand he held an old ceramic lamp with a green base.

He turned, shouting something, and that’s when the other figure appeared from the doorway. A man with broad shoulders, head bowed as he entered, dragging something behind him. His jacket was soaked, the hem drooping onto the carpet. However, it was the **mask** that froze her.

It was stitched together crudely, like a child had made it. He said nothing, just moved forward. The father lunged, shattering the lamp. The man didn’t move like someone in a frenzy. He stepped forward like he *had all the time in the worl*d. He raised the blade and pushed it into the father’s chest. Again and again. Each thrust sounded hollow, like boots sinking into mud. The father’s eyes didn’t even have time to register the pain. He was gone before he hit the floor.

The mother appeared in the hallway, barefoot and panting. Her robe was open at the side, and she was whispering like she was trying to rewind time. She grabbed the twins, pulling them into a closet. Drew climbed in first, too dazed to protest. Alina followed, pushing him back and closing the doors behind them. From inside, Sarah could see through their eyes and now through the slats. They watched as their mother backed into the kitchen, fumbling for the phone on the wall. She pressed it to her ear, screaming, “Hello? Please…”

The masked man followed her in silence. From his pocket, he drew a belt. He didn’t strike her; instead, he stepped behind and looped the belt around her neck. Her scream cut off mid-word. Her heels scratched at the floor as her fingers clawed at the buckle. Her last look was toward the closet. She choked then fell.

Inside the wardrobe, Drew began to cry. Sarah, watching through Drew’s eyes, could feel the rabbit clenched in her arms, could feel his knees pressed to his chest. Alina tried to shush him, covering his mouth, but it was too late. The masked man was already standing outside. They couldn’t see his face, but they could hear the laboured breathing like he was sniffing for something.

He opened the wardrobe, and the light immediately hit their faces. Sarah wanted to scream, to run, but she couldn’t move. The man reached in, grabbed Alina by the hair, and dragged her out, her legs flagging. She didn’t cry but made a single, hollow sound that came from deep in her chest.

He left the wardrobe door open. Five months later, the landlady returned. She was tired of chasing the tenant, tired of unanswered calls and unpaid rent. This time, she came in person, her heels clicking on the cracked hallway tiles as she strode to the door of 6A.

She knocked sharply. “Ms. Linton! Rent’s overdue. You need to pay, or I’m turning this in.”

There was no answer. She knocked again, louder this time. She tried the handle, and it was locked. Her patience snapped. She pulled out her phone and dialled the police.

The officers arrived late afternoon, two of them, one younger and one older. They rang the bell, knocked on every nearby door, but no one came. The landlady led them to 6A, unlocked it with the spare key she kept for emergencies.

They stepped inside, and the smell hit them immediately. The walls had a greasy film, and the air was heavy.

“Jesus…” the younger cop muttered, pulling his collar up.

The older one shined his flashlight across the room. The living space was disordered, furniture tipped, broken shards of glass scattered on the floor. Faded stains darkened the carpet near the kitchen.

They found the bodies first: the father in the living room and the mother slumped in the kitchen, a dark belt looped tightly around her neck, skin bruised and mottled. Her eyes were open, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Outside, behind the building, the janitor heard a faint whimpering. He found her there, beneath the dumpster’s rusted metal, Alina. She was wet, shaking, and clutching one single shoe, the red sneaker Sarah had helped them find. The ambulance arrived and rushed her to the hospital. At the hospital, she was admitted directly to intensive care.

The police investigation was methodical and minimal. They photographed, documented, and filed. No arrests were made because of a lack of evidence. Their only witness, Alina, showed no signs of life, which made them lock the door and file a cold case. The apartment remained sealed. Its windows shuttered. Its halls emptied. The building continued without it.

Sarah woke, face pressed hard against the cold wood of her coffee table. Her fingers cramped, nails digging crescent moons into her palms. The laptop lay dark and dead. The crayons were scattered on the floor. Sarah sat up slowly. The silence in the room pressed in, heavier than any noise.

At first, she thought she was still dreaming. There was a drawing beneath her hand. She was certain it belonged to Alina, as her name was written on the far left corner. The strokes were harsh, uneven, pressed so deeply that they tore the paper. It was her, in a hospital bed. She was thin, with closed eyes, tubes in her arms, her birthmark visible on her temple, and wearing the same necklace she had on now. Next to the bed was a number, room 305.

Further, there was an address, repeated three times as if the drafter wanted her to understand and follow. She stared at it until her eyes dried out, then carefully folded it without realizing it, and called Mia. The hospital didn’t seem haunted. The walls were too clean and bright, and the flowers at the front desk were alive, placed in water. When Sarah told the nurse the room number, the nurse’s expression changed.

“Coma ward,” she said, as if it explained something. Room 305. Sarah heard herself breathing as she walked down the hall, each step sounding out of place. The door was open. Alina lay motionless beneath stiff white sheets, her hair unevenly trimmed, and her arms so thin they barely supported the IVs. Sarah stood there, her stomach twisting. It felt wrong, as if crying might break the atmosphere.

That’s when she saw it, a folded scrap of paper, half-covered between the mattress and the wall. She reached for it, unfolded it, and saw the crayon again. Five words,

""Tell the police to find my brother.""

She read it twice, then again. The police didn’t believe her, perhaps another girl with a saviour complex, a hallucination, an old wound trying to close, but Sarah persisted. She showed them the note, the address, the drawing, the dream that wasn’t a dream. She showed them Alina. Finally, a detective said, “We’ll check, but this doesn’t mean anything.” They returned to apartment 6A. The door was still stiff from being broken five months earlier. Dust covered the floor as if never been cleaned, and the air was heavy, as if the place had been waiting.

The officer moved slowly, checked the living room, kitchen, hallway, and finally, the bedroom. Nothing had changed, except for one thing, the closet. It had changed.

The officer had been in the room less than thirty seconds. They had already searched this place months ago, but the detective, the younger one with the buzz cut and the tight jaw, had insisted they do it again.

""Thoroughly this time,"" he said.

No one expected anything. He paused in the bedroom. The air was different here. He slowly opened the closet door. That’s when he saw the pile of clothes and blankets mashed together in the corner like they’d been shoved to cover something up. He crouched and pulled one layer back. There he was.

A boy, barely seven. Knees pulled to his chest, cheeks sunken, and eyes half-lidded but not open. He was so small he could have been mistaken for a doll. He still had the rabbit clutched to his chest with a hand that had dried to bone under the skin.

At that exact moment, halfway across the city in the white, humming stillness of a hospital room, Alina’s heart monitor flat-lined. Just like that. Her body simply let go. The nurses rushed in, shouting orders. A code was called, the crash cart wheeled, but nothing worked. She was gone. Her hand was curled loosely beside her. When Sarah entered the room seconds later, she noticed the difference immediately. The air had lightened.

One of the detectives had been on a call, and as soon as the call disconnected, he ordered the others to immediately make an arrest. Inside the closet, they found a paper drawn by Drew.

In a blue crayon were the words written,

“Mr Jackson took Alina.”

“Mr Jackson put his belt around mommy’s neck.”

“Mr Jackson killed daddy.”

Mr Jackson, the janitor, brutally murdered the small family. There had been a dispute about the father calling him out because Drew had mentioned how he had been touching him when they were alone. The cold case was finally brought to light, and the wondering souls were laid to rest.

Later, when the headlines faded and the apartment was cleared, Sarah found herself sitting at the park bench where she’d first promised to show Alina how to fly a kite. The air was quiet, and the grass had dried. No children ran past her. She thought back not just to the last few weeks, but every time they’d been here. It hit her all at once. There had never been other children. No games of tag around them, no parents watching from the sidelines. The twins had only played with her. Always just the three of them.

The drawings she kept were Alina's drawings, each one bore Sarah’s handwriting. She’d thought they were gifts. Now, they looked more like records, like messages. A trail left for her to follow. The strange way she’d seen through the closet slats, felt Drew’s breath, heard Alina’s thoughts, none of it had been a dream. It was as though she’d been placed inside Alina, puppeted through memory to relive what was never spoken aloud. She hadn't uncovered the truth; she'd been led there. Alina had shown her everything. Alina spoke through her to solve the case. She chose her.

1mfqh6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1mfqh6s/should_you_trust_vasterqua_appliance_sliders_for/,Should You Trust Vasterqua Appliance Sliders for Heavy Use,"Testing out the Vasterqua 24Pcs Appliance Sliders was surprisingly satisfying for someone like me who loves efficiency in the kitchen. These nifty little self-adhesive sliders promised to make moving heavy kitchen appliances easier, and, to be frank, I was skeptical at first. I’ve spent countless mornings wrestling with my bulky stand mixer to free up counter space only to end up with sore arms and frustrated thoughts. The Vasterqua sliders, however, quickly became a game-changer.

**User-Friendly Installation Process**

I’ll admit, I’m not the most patient when it comes to complicated setups, but attaching these self-adhesive sliders was ridiculously simple. All I had to do was clean the bottom of my appliance, peel off the sticker, and press the slider firmly into place. The instructions recommended waiting 12 hours before use, and while I almost couldn’t resist testing them right away, I made sure to follow the directions. The adhesive felt strong and secure, and I didn't need any additional tools or assistance.  

[Find the best price for Vasterqua 24Pcs Appliance Sliders on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0cly2x6ch/)

**Sturdiness and Durability**

One of the biggest selling points is that these sliders are made of premium PTFE material reinforced with sturdy rubber, designed to withstand the weight of heavy kitchen appliances. I tested them on my espresso machine, which, let me tell you, weighs a ton! The sliders didn’t budge or peel off, and their durability left a lasting first impression. Even after several weeks of pushing appliances across my granite countertop, there were no signs of wear or scratching.

**Effortless Movement Across Surfaces**

What I appreciated most was how smoothly everything glided. Whether it was my stand mixer, air fryer, or pressure cooker, the kitchen appliances could slide effortlessly without needing superhuman strength. My countertops are mainly marble and wood, and these sliders worked seamlessly on both surfaces. The PTFE coating on the sliders did a great job protecting my counters from any potential damage.

**Compact and Versatile Design**

Each slider measures just 0.75 inches in diameter, which is small enough to remain inconspicuous but large enough to provide reliable coverage. Their size and design make them compatible with a wide range of appliances. I even tested them on smaller gadgets like my toaster and coffee maker to see if they’d work just as well, and they didn’t disappoint. However, I wouldn’t use them on extremely lightweight appliances since those don’t really need this kind of setup.

**Key Benefits**

- Simplifies moving heavy kitchen appliances  
- Easy to install with no additional tools needed  
- Durable construction for long-lasting use  
- Protects countertops from scratches  
- Compatible with a wide variety of appliances like stand mixers, coffee makers, and pressure cookers  

**Areas of Concern**

While the positives outnumber the negatives, there are a few things worth pointing out:  

- The wait time of 12 hours for the adhesive to fully cure may test your patience if you need to begin using them immediately.  
- Although they glide well on smooth surfaces, I noticed a bit of resistance on textured wood surfaces, though this didn’t significantly hinder functionality.  
- This may not be the best fit for ultra-lightweight appliances that don’t stay stationary easily.  

**Product Competitors**

I’ve come across similar appliance sliders from brands like Magic Sliders and X-Protector in the past, so comparing them with the Vasterqua sliders was inevitable. While the Magic Sliders offer decent compatibility, they aren’t as small in design, so they stick out more than I’d like. X-Protector’s options are excellent for anti-scratch properties but lack the same level of durability when it comes to withstanding heavy appliances. Vasterqua seems to find a sweet spot with its blend of size, durability, and ease of use.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

When you consider the versatility and convenience the Vasterqua sliders offer, their cost feels justified. It’s not every day you get a product that both simplifies appliance handling and extends the life of your countertop. I even shared a few with my mom, and she’s already planning to buy another set. It really feels like a budget-friendly upgrade for households tackling space and organization challenges.

1mfqfzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mfqfzb/why_is_the_best_electric_kettle_oxo_brew_worth_a/,Why is the best electric kettle OXO Brew worth a closer look?,"The OXO 8716900 Adjustable Temperature Kettle recently became a staple in my kitchen, and truthfully, it's changing how I approach my tea and coffee rituals. Being a morning tea enthusiast, having a kettle able to heat water between 170°F to 212°F precisely was a game-changer. It’s not just about hot water; it’s about precision, convenience, and a bit of flair in your kitchen gear. This kettle, while exceptional, does have a few quirks worth noting.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This product looks like it was made to impress. The sleek combination of borosilicate glass and stainless steel fits in perfectly with modern kitchen setups. The BPA-free borosilicate glass isn't just a pretty face, though—it resists thermal shock like a champ. While boiling water, you can watch the levels rise, thanks to its crystal-clear glass body and well-marked measurements in milliliters and ounces. Its 360-degree swivel base makes it incredibly easy to grab and replace from multiple angles, and for a clumsy person like me, that's a major win. The silicone base ensures your countertop stays scratch-free, while the stainless steel filter handles straining duties effectively. Plus, I’ve got to say, the way the lid slow-opens with steam control has already saved me from unwanted water splatter chaos.

**Performance and Ease of Use**  
Where this kettle truly shines is in its performance. It has a backlit screen and a handy one-dial interface that makes it easy to dial in your preferred water temperature. Whether you’re brewing delicate green tea or hearty French press coffee, the OXO adjustable kettle gets the job done. Being able to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius is an underrated feature because my recipes seem to enjoy bouncing between both systems. Once your desired water temperature is reached, it kindly alerts you. If you’ve been distracted mid-boil—and I admit, this often happens to me—there’s a 30-minute hold feature to keep your water at the exact temperature. For anyone serious about their brews, this one feature alone could seal the deal.

[Check OXO 8716900 Adjustable Temperature Kettle price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b01ktrdknw/)

**Strengths**  
This electric kettle has plenty to brag about, and a few key highlights stood out to me:  
- Precise temperature control from 170°F to 212°F for tea, coffee, and beyond.  
- Borosilicate glass construction ensures durability and offers a clear water-level view.  
- Cord-free design when removed from swivel base for easy transport.  
- Built-in perforated stainless steel filter for a smoother pour and straining simplicity.  
- Comfortable non-slip handle that stays cool to the touch.  

While these features make it a fantastic addition to any kitchen, there’s no such thing as a perfect product.

**Areas for Improvement**  
After putting it to the test for weeks, a few minor hurdles emerged:  
- It’s slightly on the heavier side at 4 pounds, which could annoy someone who appreciates a lighter design.  
- The price could feel steep compared to simpler kettles, especially if you’re not fully using its advanced features.  
- A bit noisy while in use, though nothing too excessive—it’s background chatter at best.  

These aren’t deal-breakers, but if you’re expecting silence or a feather-light gadget, it's worth considering.

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing it to competitors like the Breville BKE820XL or the Cuisinart CPK-17, the differences become apparent. Breville’s model also offers customizable temperature settings but carries a bulkier design that lacks the visual appeal of crystal-clear glass. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart kettle’s rapid-boil feature might outpace the OXO during a time trial, but it lacks the sophisticated thermal-shock-resistant materials of this product. Ultimately, if you prioritize stunning design alongside smart functionality, this kettle is tough to beat.

**Value for Money**  
Speaking of investments, I’d say this kettle delivers solid value for the expense. Sure, it may lean on the pricier side, but for what it offers in terms of precision heating, durability, and unique features like the soft-open lid, it’s worth every cent. Especially for someone like me who is picky about tea and dabbles in specialty coffee brewing, it feels like having a barista’s secret weapon on the countertop.

When I decided to get my shit together and wake up, I made some coffee and knocked on her door. Her voice, barely even heard it, like some whispering, not the usual energy I hear from her. I opened the door. She was lying in her bed, had a really tired face.

I asked if she was okay. And she told me that she's just feeling awful, tired. At a ""low point"", to be exact. I didn't want to force it out of her, last time I tried to ask about her feelings she just started the ""I don't want to bother you with this type of stuff"". And I know she feels like it's her responsibility to always act okay, put together and such, that's why she never opens up. I really want to help her. She's under a lot of stress. She mentioned my grandma, her husband, and so on. I really wanted to ask her if I could help with something, but I was a bit shocked, too, on the verge of tears. Seeing her like this makes me feel shitty and I really want to help. She told me she's tired, so I left her room.

Sat in the kitchen and started crying. It's like she's always the one supporting people, but she doesn't let anyone support her. I called her husband, since she mention him to see if he knows anything, but he didn't pick it up.

Some time ago, I made a similar post somewhere about how I really want to help my mom, but got attacked by the comments, saying that if she doesn't want to talk about it I should leave her alone.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Wycombe Wanderers vs. Bradford City: A Tale of Near-Misses and Sieve Defenses**

The Wycombe vs. Bradford City clash in League 1 is shaping up to be a nail-biter, a match where the difference between victory and heartbreak could hinge on whether a player remembers to tie their shoelaces. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game feels like a chess match played on a trampoline.

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Tightrope

The odds tell a story of two evenly matched teams with a dash of “*meh*” thrown in for good measure. Wycombe Wanderers sits at decimal odds of **\~2.85** (implied probability: **35%**), while Bradford City hovers slightly higher at **\~2.4** (**41.5%**). The draw? A bloated **\~3.25** (**30.5%**), suggesting bookmakers are betting on a stalemate as much as a result. Translating this to real terms: it’s like watching two overconfident chefs duel in a kitchen—someone might win, but the chances of a burnt offering (i.e., a draw) are alarmingly high.

The goal totals also scream *“cautious optimism.”* The “Under 2.5 goals” line is priced at **\~1.65-1.7**, implying bookmakers expect a combined **2 goals or fewer**. If this game mirrors last season’s Wycombe-Bradford encounters, we’re in for a defensive slugfest where scoring feels like solving a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded.

### Digesting the News: Wycombe’s “Almost” and Bradford’s “Almost Not”

Wycombe, as the articles note, “narrowly missed promotion last season.” Let’s unpack that. Missing promotion is football’s version of almost winning the lottery but settling for a free coffee. Their coach, praised as “good,” might be the reason they’re *almost* good enough—though “good” in League 1 often translates to “mediocre in the Premier League.” Still, motivation is key: Wycombe’s players will be channe

I'd like your advice on a potential grinder change.

I bought a Silenzio 55 a few months ago. A well and good until we started using light roast beans. Since then, after 2 coffees the grinder starts but no coffee comes out.The only way I can grind my beans is by doing single dose...

Wrote to Eureka, they told me to check with my retailer.

Went to see my retailer. They say the grinder works as intended and it's normal that the grinder jams to protect it's motor. Apparently it's because I grind finely close to the zero point. I find it disappointing because I barely can do a 1 to 2 recipe in 30 seconds...

Instead of me buying the Eureka single dose hopper and bellows, my retailer kindly offered I pay the same amount and upgrade to the Zero 65 AP instead.

Should I make the switch? Is the grinder really better than the Silenzio 55 for lighter roasted beans? 

What do you guys think?

Thank you

TLDR:
1. Does the Zero 65 AP grind finer than the Silenzio 55?
2. Can the Zero 65 AP dial easily be changed to one that is smaller? (we only do espresso)
3. Can the Zero 65 AP be used without the black cover thingy over the dosing cup?
4. Can the Zero 65 AP be used to grind directly to the portafilter?",1,1754140772.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Upon first injection of 150ug I definitely could tell that I took something, but over the day, I actually lost energy.

I started researching & someone else on Reddit found that we need to add methyl donors when we take SS-31.

I found this out by 2pm. Took them (because of course I have 1 million supplements from trying to solve my exhaustion) and by 5pm I noticed that I had been getting a lot of physical tasks done.

I had been motoring around & not feeling PEM!

Normally a task like washing dishes takes me out for 3 days.

I see a lot of posts with people having hit or miss results & wanted to share this. 

This community has helped me so much.

* Methylcobalamin (B12)
* TMG (Betaine Anhydrous)
* NAD+ (I personally had the Renue brand NMN powder that you put under your tongue.)

Good luck to you all.

**Context**

Diagnoses: 
* Severe adhd from childhood
* POTS symptoms since ~12 years old. Never officially diagnosed.
* Diagnosed with cfs in 2017 after a sleep study showed no issues & my blood work has always been fine.
* Had Covid 4 times in 2022. Took all the vaccines from 2020/21.
* Through trial & error and finally validated by a Strategene genome report I figured out that my body has glutathione issues.

Through trialing hundreds of supps I found some help in liposomal glutathione under the tongue. (Only the bulletproof brand liposomal version works if I swallow the pill.)

This was the first thing that started making me feel better.

Then, I discovered glutamine & ribose (ribose needs Berberine added to prevent dementia risk). Both of these feel like what I think coffee does to “normal” people. Coffee puts me to sleep.

So far SS-31 feels better than those 2. It does feel like the energy is within & like it’s fixing something.

Fingers crossed that it helps my squirrelly adhd brain too!

Notes: yes, I’ve taken all the stimulants, low dose naltrexone, ssri’s and more.

Right now, I’m getting the most benefit from this peptide + glutathione.

I think from COVID I was trembling when standing. L-citrulline malate plus beet root powder helped that tremendously. I’ve since healed from whatever issue that was.

1mfqadw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1mfqadw/delve_into_the_best_countertop_microwave_toshiba/,Delve Into the Best Countertop Microwave Toshiba EM131A5C-BS,"The Toshiba EM131A5C-BS microwave has been a staple in my kitchen for weeks now, and I’ve delved deep into what makes this mid-sized countertop appliance tick. It’s an unassuming unit that fits into a variety of kitchen setups, but there’s more to it than meets the eye. From its design to actual performance, I’ve put it through its paces to see if it lives up to the hype.

**Solid and Sleek Design**  
Aesthetically, the black stainless-steel exterior is sophisticated and fits seamlessly into most modern kitchens. Its dimensions of 18.4 x 23.3 x 15 inches mean it doesn’t hog precious counter space. At 34.6 pounds, it’s suitably weighted to stay put during regular use without being inconvenient when rearranging the appliance setup. The large, easy-to-grip door handle is honestly one of my favorite features—it’s such a small but noticeable touch that makes daily use less annoying. With a 1.2 cubic feet capacity, this microwave easily fits a large dinner plate or a 12-inch pizza, which makes it versatile for larger households or those, like me, who hate reheating food in tiny batches.

**Highlights**  
- Large interior with a 12.4-inch turntable to accommodate sizable dishes.  
- The black stainless-steel look adds a modern flair to your kitchen.  
- User-friendly handle design for quick access.  

[Check Toshiba EM131A5C-BS price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b071wcb1t6/)

**Dependable Performance for Daily Use**  
It’s not just a pretty face. This 1000-watt microwave consistently delivers reliable heating, and the pre-programmed sensor menus are a game changer. Foods like potatoes, veggies, and pizza come out evenly heated without needing multiple trial-and-error runs. For someone who loves quick fixes, this saved me a lot of trouble. The ten power levels give you flexibility, whether you’re defrosting meat or trying to melt butter without nuking it into oblivion. Additionally, the ability to add extra 30-second intervals mid-cooking is a thoughtful touch—something I’ve frequently used when trying to warm leftovers or a cup of coffee.

**Innovative Control Features**  
The digital control panel is clear, and the responsive buttons are a pleasant surprise. Despite that, there is a protective film on the keypad that requires peeling beforehand—something worth noting for first-time users. I particularly appreciated the mute function. By holding the ""8"" button for a few seconds, I could turn off the beeping sound—a Godsend, especially when warming midnight snacks without waking anyone. This microwave has become a silent workhorse in my routine.

**Drawbacks**  
- The keypad protective film could be confusing if not removed, leading to potential frustration for first-timers.  
- The interior light only activates when the microwave is in use, meaning you can’t inspect stored items without opening the door.  

**Strengths in Daily Convenience**  
What deserves mention is the ECO mode, which minimizes standby power consumption. While this might seem trivial, it’s great for energy-conscious households, and it has reduced my kitchen’s electricity use beyond just the heating performance.  

Programming up to three favorite cooking commands was something I initially brushed off, thinking it was unnecessary. But honestly, programming go-to power and time combos for things like oatmeal or frozen meals became weirdly satisfying.

**Energy Efficiency Compared to Product Rivals**  
Comparing similar models, like those from Panasonic and Hamilton Beach, this unit stands out with features such as the smart humidity sensor. Panasonic microwaves occasionally skip this feature in budget-friendly models, relying instead on manual adjustments. On the other hand, while Hamilton Beach’s designs are great for minimalists, they often lack advanced control features like the Toshiba’s mute option or pre-set cooking menus. However, it’s worth noting that Toshiba takes the lead in total energy efficiency with the ECO mode. Despite other brands occasionally shaving off a bit of time when heating frozen items, they can fall short when it comes to overall usability.

**Best Value for Daily Needs**  
Considering what’s packed into this microwave, the balance between quality and price justifies the investment. There’s nothing about this product that screams extravagance, and yet every dollar feels well spent. Everyday activities—whether preparing meals quickly or reheating leftovers—become effortless. Very few products in this price category deliver this level of consistent functionality along with modern style.

As someone who thrives on caffeine to start the day, I couldn’t wait to see how this dual-function coffee maker would compare to my previous machines. The promise of brewing both coffee grounds and K-Cup pods, combined with three distinct brew styles—Classic, Rich, and Over Ice—immediately caught my attention. I put it through its paces over the span of a couple of months, several coffee drinkers in my family joining the journey.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek, black exterior of this coffee maker is modern and fits seamlessly into my kitchen setup without taking up too much counter space. At just over 11 inches deep and 15 inches tall, it’s compact enough to store easily under cabinets, yet sturdy enough with an attractive finish that feels premium. The removable water reservoir deserves applause for its practical design; it’s easy to detach, refill, and reattach. It can hold 60 ounces of water, making it convenient for hosting a steady parade of coffee cups during our weekend brunches. However, despite its sophisticated look, I did notice some minor smudge marks appeared fairly easily on the black paint finish.

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
Brewing versatility is where this coffee maker shines. Want a quick single-serve cup using your favorite pod? Done in minutes. Craving a full carafe of freshly brewed coffee? That’s a breeze too. The coffee’s flavor profile also impressed me. Classic and Rich brew styles were my go-to options; there’s a noticeable difference in strength between the two. The Over Ice setting gives you cold coffee that actually tastes like coffee—not some diluted, watery mess. As someone who indulges heavily in iced lattes during the summer months, this felt like a standout feature. However, brewing a carafe seemed to take slightly longer than my older drip machine, though the wait was well worth it for the robust flavor.

**Highlights**  
- Extremely flexible brewing options for both pods and grounds  
- Flavor consistently rich and full-bodied, even for Over Ice settings  
- Intuitive buttons and branding make it simple to operate  
- Removable water reservoir makes refilling quick and spill-free  

[Check Ninja CFP201 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b08qzxfskp/)

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Operating this machine didn’t intimidate even the least technology-friendly members of my family. The buttons are self-explanatory, and switching between pods and grounds happens seamlessly with the included K-Cup pod adapter. My teenager had their first solo back-to-school coffee experience with no hiccups, which says a lot. Maintenance, on the other hand, was a mixed bag. The auto-clean function is helpful, but the drip tray and warming plate demanded frequent wiping to avoid leftover coffee stains, especially if you forget to wipe it immediately after brewing. Also, being a drip coffee machine, it still uses paper filters, which some might find less eco-friendly compared to reusable fine mesh counterparts.

**Shortcomings**  
- Cleaning the warming plate requires close attention  
- Paper filters add ongoing costs and create waste  
- Brewing a full carafe takes slightly longer than expected  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this coffee maker to other machines in the market like the Keurig K-Duo Plus and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, I found that the Ninja model carves out its uniqueness with its ice coffee brew capability and the tailored brew strength features. The Keurig model performed similarly but lacked the depth of brew customization this one provides. While Hamilton Beach is slightly more affordable, it misses out on the same modern, streamlined build and offers fewer brew style options. Ultimately, the Ninja DualBrew's thoughtful mix of advanced brewing methods and ease of use gave it the edge.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering all factors—design, functionality, performance, and ease of use—it offers a compelling mix of features that justifies the price. I’ve seen coffee-obsessed friends spend similar amounts on machines that barely offer half the functionality this one does. Having both K-Cup and grounds brewing options in one system alone made it a worthwhile investment for me, saving on having to own multiple machines or gadgets. While it’s not the cheapest option on the block, its build quality and the results it produces feel like a solid return for coffee lovers.

1mfq8gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1mfq8gn/unexpected_behavior_on_the_sculptor_078_at_finer/,Unexpected Behavior on the Sculptor 078 at Finer Settings – Anyone Else?,"I’ve been using the Sculptor 078 for a while now, usually sticking to grind settings around 8–9 (burr touch at -2). I generally aim for a brew time of 3:00 to 3:30, and that range has been working well for my taste preferences.

After watching Lance Hedrick’s comparison video between the Ode Gen 2 and the Sculptor, I noticed he was grinding way finer—around 6 on the 078—which surprised me. I decided to test it myself.

I took the same beans that usually give me ~3:30 at setting 9 and ground them at 6. Surprisingly, the brew time only went up to about 3:45, which is a minimal increase considering how much finer the grounds looked. The coffee bed definitely looked finer to the eye, but visually, the amount of fines didn’t seem much different.

Now here’s the kicker: the cup at setting 6 was noticeably sweeter, with a rounder body and more overall harmony. No overextraction notes, no dryness, no bitterness—just a really pleasant, integrated cup.

This got me thinking:
Is it possible that the amount of fines produced by the 078 doesn’t increase proportionally when going finer, meaning the expected brew time increase is much smaller than assumed?

Curious if others have noticed similar behavior with the 078 or other high-end flat burr grinders. Is this more about burr geometry or the way fines are generated at different settings?

1mfq7nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mfq7nb/explore_best_nugget_ice_maker_by_euhomy_and/,Explore Best Nugget Ice Maker by EUHOMY and Should You Buy It,"Finding a reliable and efficient ice maker can be tricky, but after using the EUHOMY IM-12S-HM firsthand, I can see why it has gained traction as a top appliance. As someone who loves hosting weekend gatherings and sipping iced coffee throughout the day, having a high-performing device really makes life easier. The promise of fresh nugget-style ice in just six minutes immediately caught my eye, and I must admit, this countertop ice wizard impressed me in more ways than one.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact design of this ice maker is one of its standout features. It fits neatly on my countertop without taking up more space than necessary, measuring just 11.61"" deep, 9.45"" wide, and 12.99"" high. It’s lightweight enough to move around, thanks to the sturdy handle, making it ideal for trips to the RV, picnics, or simply relocating it from the kitchen to the bar area during parties. The matte black plastic body is sleek and modern, while the design details, like the ice scoop holder and large viewing window, add both functionality and style. I’ve received several compliments on how well it matches my other appliances.

**Performance and Ice Quality**  
True to its claim, this machine churns out nugget ice incredibly quickly. In just six to eight minutes, I had munchable pellet ice ready for soft drinks, iced coffee, and my kids’ smoothies. It can produce up to 34 pounds of ice in a day, which, trust me, is more than enough even for larger gatherings. I especially appreciate the texture of the ice—it’s soft, chewable, and retains the flavor of drinks without diluting them too quickly, which is a huge bonus during summer heatwaves.

**Good Points**  
- Ice ready in only 6 minutes, incredibly fast turnaround.  
- Produces nugget-style ice perfect for icy beverages and snacks.  
- Compact and portable, fits seamlessly into small spaces.  
- User-friendly design with a viewing window and ice scoop holder.  
- Quiet operation at less than 50 dB, making it peaceful to run.

**Smart Features and Cleaning**  
Another feature worth applauding is the smart functionality. Sensors alert you when it’s time to add water or when the ice bin is full, saving unnecessary frustration. The auto-cleaning function has been a lifesaver. By simply pressing the “Ice/Clean” button for three seconds, it runs a 15-minute cleaning cycle. Additionally, the removable top cover allows for a more thorough manual clean when needed. This level of convenience ensures that the ice is always fresh and safe to use. Trust me, I’ve had ice makers in the past that were more work than they were worth, but this isn’t one of them.

**Noise and Energy Efficiency**  
I’m someone who hates unnecessary noise at home, especially when I’m working. Thankfully, this ice maker runs quietly, staying under 50 decibels. I can write emails, host calls, or even take a nap knowing the ice maker isn’t going to disrupt my peace. Its energy-saving design also caught my attention. With a daily energy consumption of just around 3 kWh, it’s not a burden on electricity bills. For anyone hosting regularly or using it daily, this is a valuable money-saving perk.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited capacity of the removable basket at 1.8 pounds.  
- Ice may occasionally clump together if left unused for too long.  
- The plastic material feels slightly less durable than expected.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing similar machines, the GE Profile Opal and the Frigidaire EFIC235 are names that come up often. The GE model certainly has a more premium feel and offers a smartphone app for scheduling ice production, but it also comes with a significantly higher price tag. The Frigidaire model is slightly more affordable and performs similarly, but it lacks the advanced self-cleaning feature that makes the EUHOMY stand out. For the price and performance combination, this nugget ice maker holds its own, especially for household or smaller-scale commercial use.

**Smart Spending**  
Given its range of features and consistent performance, the price matches its value. While other brands might offer niche features, they often do so at a higher cost. This particular ice maker excels at delivering efficient ice production, portability, and ease of use—all while remaining friendly to your wallet. I personally feel confident in saying that it’s worth every penny, especially for busy individuals or families looking to elevate their ice game without overextending their budget.

As someone who enjoys a freshly brewed cup of coffee every morning, having tested this coffee maker over the past few weeks has been a delightful experience. This product combines modern design with superb functionality, making it an exciting choice for coffee lovers. It's not without its quirks, but the level of craftsmanship and attention to detail is worth a deeper look.

**Stylish and Functional Design for Any Kitchen**  
The first thing I noticed about this French press is the bamboo wood handle, a detail that gives it an earthy and sophisticated vibe. The thick, heat-resistant borosilicate glass and stainless steel accents exude durability while complementing the overall sleek and modern aesthetic. The ml/oz markings on the side of the carafe add a functional element that’s surprisingly handy. Its compact size fits nicely on my kitchen countertop without feeling intrusive, and the anti-slip silicone base is a thoughtful touch that prevents accidents. My clumsy mornings felt safer with no fear of the French press sliding around.

[Check Home Hero HHKA0107 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d6b73b4w/)

**Rich and Smooth Coffee: A Brewing Experience to Savor**  
Unlike other French presses I’ve owned, this one features a state-of-the-art 4-layer filtration system. Let me tell you, the difference it makes in the clarity and taste of coffee is profound. The combination of a coiled filter, two fine mesh layers of stainless steel, and a cross plate ensures that even those pesky fines stay at the bottom of the carafe. I tested it on both coarse-ground and medium-grind coffee, and while it worked well with the intended coarse grind, the medium grind required more careful plunging to avoid clogging.

**Durability Meets Heat Retention**  
Durability is a standout feature here. The heat-resistant borosilicate glass combined with sturdy stainless steel makes the coffee maker feel like it could survive daily use without issues. Pouring boiling water into this French press felt secure, thanks to the high-quality materials. Additionally, the stainless steel frame effectively retained heat, keeping my coffee at the right temperature much longer than expected, which was a pleasant surprise during leisurely breakfast weekends.  

**Effortless Cleaning for the Busy Coffee Drinker**  
Cleaning up after use is something I always dread with kitchen appliances, but this French press keeps cleanup relatively simple. The dishwasher-safe glass canister saved me a ton of time, although the stainless steel body and bamboo handle had to be hand-washed. It didn’t bother me much, as they maintained their polished look even after weeks of use. The ease of disassembling the filtration system was also a highlight—it made removing grounds and washing all the components a breeze.  

**Advantages**  
- Stunning bamboo handle and sleek design fit any modern kitchen.  
- Effective 4-layer filtration system ensures smooth coffee without pesky grounds.  
- Heat-resistant borosilicate glass and stainless steel frame provide durability.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Hand washing the bamboo handle feels like an extra chore for some users.  
- Medium-grind coffee can cause minor clogging in the filtration system.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this French press to its rivals like the Bodum Chambord and Secura Stainless Steel French Press, there are clear points where it excels and areas where it could improve. The Home Hero's filtration system is notably superior to Bodum's standard two-layer system, resulting in a smoother cup of coffee. However, the Bodum comes in at a lighter weight, which may suit travelers better. Meanwhile, the Secura, fully stainless steel, offers unmatched durability but doesn’t have the visual appeal or heat-resistant glass construction that preserves the coffee's aroma and oils like the Home Hero.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For the features packed into this product, I’d argue it offers solid value for its price point. Products in this segment can range widely in cost, but the Home Hero HHKA0107 stands out as a well-priced middle-ground option. You’re getting a blend of functional innovation and aesthetic charm without going into premium pricing territory. If you’re someone who loves their gadgets to look good on the kitchen counter while still delivering functionality, this French press justifies its investment.

I’ve tested countless coffee accessories, and I have to say the Sumex B085VS1R12 charcoal filters for Cuisinart coffee makers genuinely impressed me with their compact and functional design. The filters are housed in a high-quality micromesh material that does a great job of keeping the activated charcoal in place. There’s no fear of messy leakage into your machine. They’re lightweight at only 2.88 ounces each and designed to fit all Cuisinart coffee machines, which is remarkably convenient. Unlike some other filters that feel flimsy or poorly constructed, these have a sturdy feel while remaining easy to install.

**Filter Performance**

Testing these filters daily, I noticed an immediate improvement in water quality. Their ultra-fine grain charcoal is a game-changer. The filtration process effectively removed chlorine, calcium, and other impurities, making a noticeable difference in the taste of my coffee. The flavors of my morning brew were richer, and there was no strange aftertaste that hard water occasionally leaves behind. Over time, I found that the water coming out of my coffee maker even had less of that telltale chlorine smell.  

[Check Sumex B085VS1R12 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b085vs1r12/)

**Ease of Installation**

The filters were incredibly easy to set up. Just rinse them under cold water for a minute and slide them into the designated compartment of your Cuisinart coffee maker. I didn’t encounter any issues with fitting, which is refreshing since I’ve faced frustratingly incompatible filters in the past. Every single filter from the 12-pack fit perfectly and securely. It truly feels like they were designed with the end-user in mind.

**Merits**

- Fits all Cuisinart coffee makers, whether old or new models.  
- High-performance micromesh material ensures no charcoal escapes into your beverage.  
- Enhances coffee’s flavor by eliminating multiple water impurities.  
- Solid value with 12 filters included in one efficient pack.  

**Critiques**

- Missing an indicator to signal when the filter needs changing.  
- Longevity could vary based on water hardness – requiring regular attention.  
- Packaging could be more eco-friendly.  

**Comparison with Competitive Options**

Looking at some competitors in the market, like the Maxtra or Aquacrest water filters, which also claim to purify water for coffee machines, this product holds up very well. The finer charcoal grain offers superior filtration compared to the coarser materials in other brands. However, it doesn’t have fancy features like a built-in filter-life timer, something found in certain competing brands. On the upside, it's compatible with every Cuisinart machine—a flexibility not all rivals offer. Regarding pricing, the 12-pack format outshines competitors by delivering better cost-efficiency per filter.

**Price Performance**

Considering all factors, these filters hit the sweet spot of performance and affordability. The deal seems even better when comparing the 12-pack value with individual filters from other brands, which cost significantly more per piece. If you drink coffee as obsessively as I do, this pack definitely gives you your money’s worth. Though it lacks a few bells and whistles, it delivers where it truly matters: cleaner water and better-tasting coffee.

## Key Features Analysis

The disposable coffee cup market offers a wide range of features. Let's delve into some of the most critically important factors that consumers should take into consideration.

**coffee Blend and Roast:** The flavor of the coffee is paramount. The best disposable cups provide a balanced and satisfying taste, achieved through careful selection of coffee beans and roasting techniques.

Each Brand sources its beans from various locations around the globe. Each Brand offers a range of roasts, from light and mild to dark and bold, catering to diverse flavor preferences. The quality of the beans and the precision of the roasting process directly impact the aroma,body,and overall enjoyment of the coffee.

**Packaging and materials:** Eco-consciousness is playing an ever-increasing role in consumer choices. Enduring packaging is no longer a niche offering but a standard expectation.

Many leading brands are shifting towards recyclable or compostable materials for their cups and lids. This includes using Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper for the cups and compostable bioplastics for the lids. The packaging is also designed to minimize waste and reduce the environmental impact throughout the product lifecycle.

**Ease of Use and Preparation:** The convenience of disposable coffee cups is their primary selling point.The best options are simple to prepare, requiring minimal effort and no specialized equipment.

This typically involves single-serve pouches or pods that are easy to open and pour into a cup of hot water. The process is designed to be quick and clean, making it ideal for busy individuals or situations where time and resources are limited. Properly measuring the coffee to water ratio is critical and should be clear on the packaging.

**Shelf Life and Storage:** Disposable coffee cups are often purchased in bulk, making shelf life a crucial consideration. High-quality products maintain their freshness and flavor over extended periods.

The nitrogen-flushing technology is commonly employed to remove oxygen from the packaging,preventing oxidation and preserving the coffee's aroma and taste.A clear ""best by"" date is prominently displayed on the packaging to ensure consumers are aware of the product's optimal consumption window. Proper storage, away from heat and moisture, is essential to maintain the coffee's quality over time.

**Portion Size and caffeine Content:** Consumers have varying preferences when it comes to portion size and caffeine levels. The best brands offer options to cater to diffrent needs and sensitivities.

Each offers portion sizes clearly labeled on each cup, and caffeine content ranging from decaf to extra caffeinated. Many brands offer decaffeinated options for those who are sensitive to caffeine or prefer to enjoy a cup of coffee later in the day. The caffeine levels are carefully managed to provide a consistent and predictable experience.

**Lid Design and Heat Retention:** The lid is a critical component of the disposable coffee cup experience. A well-designed lid prevents spills, maintains the coffee's temperature, and allows for comfortable sipping.

The lid must be secure to prevent leaks and spills, especially when on the go. The tight seal contributes to better heat retention, keeping the coffee at an enjoyable temperature for longer. Some lids feature adjustable vents to control the flow of coffee and prevent scalding.

## FAQs Section

Let's dive into some of the questions that consumers ask regarding disposable coffee cups.

**Are disposable coffee cups bad for the surroundings?**
Traditional disposable coffee cups lined with polyethylene are not easily recyclable due to the plastic lining that is tough to separate from the paper. However, many brands are now offering more sustainable alternatives using compostable or recyclable materials. Consumers should look for cups made from FSC-certified paper or biodegradable materials to minimize their environmental impact.

**How long do disposable coffee cups stay fresh?**
The shelf life of disposable coffee cups varies depending on the packaging and storage conditions. Generally, cups with nitrogen-flushed packaging can stay fresh for up to 12-18 months. It is important to store the cups in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to maintain their flavor and aroma.Always check the ""best by"" date on the packaging for optimal freshness.

**Can I use a disposable coffee cup with any type of coffee maker?**
No, disposable coffee cups are designed for single-use preparation by adding hot water directly to the cup. They are not intended for use in automatic coffee makers or brewing machines. Using them in a coffee maker could damage the machine or result in an uneven brew.

**Are all disposable coffee cups the same size?**
No, disposable coffee cups come in various sizes to cater to different preferences. Common sizes range from 8 ounces to 16 ounces.

1mfq36c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/1mfq36c/youre_invited_start_your_own_defi_brands_under/,You’re invited! Start your own De-Fi brands under our Umbrella!,"Most meme tokens go viral, then disappear. A few turn into ecosystems, but nearly all are locked to one use case, one founder, or one token.

Kendu is different. It’s an open-source brand, a name anyone can build under, without permission, and without starting at zero.

If you’ve ever wanted to launch a product, run a meme side hustle, or build something real without having to invent your own identity, Kendu is built for you.

What can you build? Anything. Kendu coffee, Kendu beer, Kendu memes, Kendu energy drinks. If it’s yours, and it flies the fox, you’re part of the brand.

This isn’t about royalties, licenses, or franchises. There’s no dev team collecting fees or approvals. The name is public, the treasury is community-controlled, the LP is burned, and there is no central mint. If you want to build something under Kendu, you can; now.

Here’s why this makes sense:

Starting from scratch: • You have no identity • You fight for trust • You pay for reach • You explain everything from the ground up

Starting with Kendu: • You use a brand with meaning • You tap into an active community • You get a visual identity and narrative baked in • You share energy with other builders instead of competing with them

You can build something small or something huge. You can do it in your own language, in your own country, with your own people. You don’t have to wait for a partnership or a listing or a roadmap update. Just use the brand, and go.

This isn’t a fork or a meme token. This is infrastructure for culture.

Kendu is what crypto was meant to be: permissionless, decentralized, and actually useful to the people holding it.

If you’re thinking about launching something and you’re wondering how to stand out, stop thinking like a founder. Think like a builder. Kendu is already here.

Let it carry the weight so you can focus on the thing you actually want to make.

As my nose can't pick out all of the notes, I see a lot of people here are very good at that, it will be short review focusing more on my 2 cents regarding each fragrance. 

Khamrah Qahwa - Very gourmand. Spicy, sweet with a slight note of coffee. It lasts very long 8+ hour easily. I don't see myself using this as everyday scent (especially not at the office). This is something I will use for dinners and special occasions during winter. 
10/10 - I think 5 ml decant will last a while so I probably won't buy a full bottle

Liquid Brun - Amazing smell. I've never tried Altair so I can't compare them. Spicy bourbon vanilla smell that is a little less sweet that Khamrah Qahwa. It lasts 6+ hours which is very good. I think this is something that can be used as everyday scent (maybe not at the office). 
10/10 - I will probably get full bottle of Mercedes Benz Club Black, as I find it more office friendly, and due to that I won't get full bottle of this

The Kingdom - Even though perfume notes are showing tobacco and mint I can't smell them. All I am getting fresher Vanilla, compared to LB, maybe this is due to mint + orange blossom? I can see myself using. I would say I like this more than Liquid Brun, probably due to it smelling a little bit less sweet to me. 10/10

Jasoor - Nice aromatic smell. I don't detect apple note. I don't have any complaints, but it is nothing special in my book. 8/10

North Stag XIV - Sweet citrusy vanila. Smells classy and has nice projection. I think it is office safe. 10/10",1,1754139873.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

Creator Guide to AI Tools You NEED to Know (Before It's Too Late) 💰,"💸 **Stop Throwing Money Away! The Creator Guide to AI Tools You NEED to Know (Before It's Too Late)** 💸

Hey everyone! So, let’s talk about something that hits close to home for a lot of us in the creator world: money. You know that feeling when you’re pouring your hard-earned cash into all the latest tools, but then you find yourself wondering if you're just tossing bills into a black hole? 😩 

I’ve been there, and honestly, it’s no fun. But guess what? AI tools can save your sanity and your wallet if you play your cards right! Let’s dive into **some killer resources** that can literally change the game for creators like us. 

**So, why bother with AI?** 
- Time is money, right? Automating tasks means you can spend more time doing what you love.
- **Less stress = more creativity!** Aren’t we all looking for that sweet spot where ideas just flow?
- Many of these tools are downright affordable (or even free!) if you know where to look. 

Here are some **must-know AI tools** you should consider:

1. **ChatGPT: Your brainstorming buddy!** 🤖  
   Ever get stuck on a script or post? Toss a few ideas at ChatGPT and see what sticks. It’s like having a creative partner that never judges.

2. **Canva’s Magic Write:**  
   Designing social media posts? Harness AI to generate captions that pop while you focus on visuals you love. 

3. **Lumen5:**  
   Turning your blogs into videos has never been easier. You’ll be taking that content repurposing game to a whole new level—hello, passive income! 

4. **Gumroad & Sellfy:**  
   If you’re selling products, these platforms offer smart pricing tools and marketing options that optimize your reach without breaking the bank.

5. **Grammarly:**  
   Seriously, who likes being that person with typos? Beat the cringe with tailored AI suggestions that'll polish up your content in no time.

6. **Jasper:**  
   This is like the Swiss Army knife of content creation. Need a blog post? Social media captions? Jasper has your back with super speedy generation.

Why **not** buckle down on these tools? Already spending too much on coffee to fuel your late-night brainstorming sessions? ☕️ I get it, but if you invest time to learn AI tools, you’re likely setting yourself up for success without the burnout.

**Real talk:**  
Every dollar spent on a tool that doesn’t help is a dollar wasted. So, what’s the ROI (return on investment) for each of these? Are they bringing your creativity to life or just sitting there gathering digital dust? I mean, we’ve all downloaded stuff that ended up as just more clutter in our digital lives, right? 🙄

So, what do you say: Ready to stop throwing money away and start using tools that empower you? Or do you have any horror stories about tools that just didn’t deliver, despite breaking the bank? 😉

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Arizona Diamondbacks vs. Oakland Athletics: A Tale of Two Slugging Siblings**

The Arizona Diamondbacks (51-58) and Oakland Athletics (48-63) clash in a slugfest that’s less “epic rivalry” and more “two tired brothers fighting over the last slice of pizza.” Both teams hit home runs like they’re on a clearance rack, but only one will avoid the culinary metaphor’s tragic ending. Let’s break it down with the precision of a stathead and the wit of a guy who once bet his lunch money on a horse named “Rainbow Bright.”

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bigger Power Play?

The Athletics are the slight favorites (-110 on the moneyline), which translates to a **52.4% implied probability** of victory. The Diamondbacks, at +110, imply a **47.6% chance**, a gap as narrow as a MLB infielder’s grasp on reality during a line drive. The total runs line sits at 10.0, with “Over” priced at \~52.6% and “Under” at \~47.4%. Given both teams rank in the top seven in MLB home runs (Oakland 6th, Arizona 7th), this game feels like a fireworks show where the fuse is… *conveniently* placed in the other team’s dugout.

---

### Statistical Shenanigans: Power vs. Consistency

* **Oakland’s Edge**: The Athletics have hit **151 home runs** this season, including a recent 7-3 stretch that makes them more reliable than your Uncle Bob’s Wi-Fi. Their starter, **J.T. Ginn** (4.29 ERA), has delivered two straight quality starts, which is about the same consistency as a coffee shop’s “decaf” promise.
* **Arizona’s Hope**: The D-Backs slug **149 homers**, led by Corbin Carroll’s all-or-nothing flair. But their starter, **Zac Gallen**, has allowed 5+ runs in four of his last seven starts—like a sieve that’s been to therapy and still can’t hold water.

The Athletics’ offense is a well-oiled machine (14th in MLB at 4.3 R/G), while Arizona’s strugg

2) favorite keychain? My keychain doesn’t quite fit the hole on the new fob, and I am sad. I’d like something quite minimal; I basically only use the fob, an AirTag, and a mini flashlight. 

3) when driving home last night, the percentage of the battery seemed to drop faster than I anticipated. When we left the home, it said ~220 miles, and about a 60 mile drive when we got home, it was down to like 119. Now, I did mess with the AC, seat cooling, etc, so I knew it would drop - but can you give me general guidance on how far the range actually is?

She said that so far, she has been able to feed up to 30pax a day, but the crew is 100pax. She said that the hardest part is doing prep work, as she is alone in all of this and is only doing everything by hand. She is in her mid-50s and has had problems with her hands in the past wherein they would just stop functioning out of fatigue, and she would be in pain for a couple days. 

She seems to be happy doing this so I wanted to make it easier for her by getting her the necessary appliances that would speed up her process and be able to feed the entire crew of 100 at some point, as this is the only way I can support her without spoon-feeding her. I just want her to regain her confidence and self-security after being in an abusive relationship for 28yrs.

What are the best tools/appliances/cookware to get for a small home kitchen for the goal we are trying to attain? We want things that are accessible in pricing with the thought of eventually getting commercial grade appliances as we move on, depending on the success of this business. She already has our old ninja food processor but she found it was difficult to use for other things such as mincing, chopping, slicing. 

Thank you for your suggestions!

EDIT: To add, she told me that they simply tell her what they want for the following day and she makes it. No menu.

When the ship is first wrecked, you’re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it’s some physical thing. Maybe it’s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it’s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don’t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you’ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what’s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything…and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it’s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O’Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you’ll come out.
Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don’t really want them to. But you learn that you’ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you’ll survive them too. If you’re lucky, you’ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.

1mfpmxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1mfpmxd/reflections_on_my_first_visit_to_an_orthodox/,Reflections on my first visit to an Orthodox Church,"Hey y’all. I meant to post this earlier, but now I have time to sit and type. 

For some background, I’m currently awaiting confirmation at the ACNA church. I grew up extremely fundamentalist southern baptist, hopped most of my teens through non denominational/brief stent on charismatic. My twenties were nondenominational, until I dove into reformed theology and ended up at a conservative united church of Christ (oxymoron sounding I know, but each individual church gets to take charge on that kinda thing). 

Anyways, my weekly service is in the evenings with the church I’m joining. There’s so many awesome Eastern Orthodox brothers here that’s I’ve spoken with, I thought I may as well go visit a parish and experience a Divine Liturgy at least once. 

The only joke I’m gonna make is this: y’all weren’t kidding about wearing comfortable shoes. I shortly learned mine weren’t as comfortable as I thought. 

So I was about 5 minutes late or so to service. I was extremely nervous about going in. I just have anxiety episodes in general and get nervous about new places with people I don’t know.  So I entered into the hallway leading to the sanctuary and coming the other way was a sweet little old lady singing and she noticed me. She greeted me and we exchanged names. She confirmed it was my first time and I wasn’t orthodox, just wanting to observe, so she handed me a liturgy book and told me to find somewhere I feel comfortable and follow the motions of standing and sitting. 

I stood in the back taking in the beautiful atmosphere. Gazing at the icons and people watching. Watching people walk in and greet one another, crossing themselves, and kissing icons. I then look across the room and spot someone from my parish. He and his wife were also visiting for the first time. He currently is in seminary and his professor encouraged him to visit an orthodox service. Finding the humor of spotting someone from my parish made all anxiety turn into laughter. 

The service was beautiful as well. Plenty of singing, chanting of scriptures, etc. I stayed back while others took the Eucharist and one member brought my friends and I some of the blessed bread. We all stepped back into the hallway as the others walked up to kiss the cross and icons once more. 

In there, the First Lady I spoke with came up to speak to me and my friends again. She introduced me to a couple more members and we also ran into another guy we knew who had visited our parish once to see what Anglican services looked like.  We were invited to coffee hour and I regret to have missed it. 

Before leaving, we all got to speak to the priest briefly as well as the First Lady on some questions I guess all of us had about their liturgy and orthodox history. 

Overall it was a pleasant experience. It’s interesting seeing the difference between western/eastern cultures in worship.

I didn’t want press any buttons and ask, what’s the phase called? How long is said phase?? Will phase 2, makeup for phase 1?? Why is she saying “phase” like where in a business presentation???

Anyways…progress maybe? Or just awareness…I dunno..was something I guess…

Quick question: Is there a single DMV in this charming little Appalachian funhouse that doesn’t resemble a FEMA camp for the spiritually dead?

This morning, in a moment of foolish optimism—and after three cups of coffee and a brief existential crisis—I showed up at the Patton Avenue DMV a full hour and a half before it opened. Thought I was being proactive. Thought I was clever. That’s adorable, right?

Wrong. The line was already wrapped around the building like society’s collective will to live. I think I saw a guy selling squirrel meat out of a Coleman cooler. A woman next to me had a thousand-yard stare like she’d been waiting since the Obama administration. I’m pretty sure a man in line behind me whispered, “De wanna wanga” and then died.

So now I’m crowdsourcing the impossible. Is there a DMV anywhere around here that doesn’t require a time machine, divine intervention, or sacrificing a goat under a blood moon? I don’t need a red carpet or a mint on my paperwork, I’d just like to renew my license without descending into a Kafkaesque bureaucratic black hole.

Naïve? Of course. But in a world where billionaires shoot themselves into space and I can’t get a plastic rectangle with my face on it, hope is the only thing they haven’t taxed yet.

I’m new to carnivore but I have one issue, I’m addicted to coffee (with milk) and I cannot give it up easily, I know there are more keto-friendly/low-carb coffees that could be made with butter, ghee, and/or heavy cream that are considered delicious and preferable by many on this diet but to me the amount of fat in those alternatives makes the coffee honestly sickening and I find the taste to be nothing like regular coffee. So, I started using small quantities of grass-fed organic milk in my coffee like 100-120 ml once a day which contains about 4-5g of total carbs. I don’t eat/drink anything sugary like honey or other carbs in general but I can’t give up dairy milk when it comes to coffee and it kinda saddens me when people say that milk is harmful and should be completely avoided, I understand it could be harmful to those with lactose intolerance or allergies or other health issues but I don’t understand why it is villainized otherwise 🥹💔

Me (21F) and my husband (30M) have been married for two years and recently had a huge fight that left me feeling really guilty and confused. I love him deeply and I know he’s hurt, but I also don’t know if I was wrong for what I said.

Here’s some context. Before we got married, he said to me and my parents he might want to move to Morocco in about 10 years. I said maybe, that I’d be open to it. But then that “maybe in 10 years” turned into 5 years, and now he wants us to move this February.

He has a business in Morocco and his family is there, so we’ve visited a lot. I’m not crazy about it. Culturally, it’s very different and I feel out of place. But I can see the financial benefits. Life’s cheaper there, we could afford private school for our daughter who is 11 months, and he could provide everything, including a maid to help me out. I really do see how it could be good for us.

At the same time, the promises keep changing. First it was 10 years, then 5, now 6 months. He also originally said we’d move to a big city, then changed it to a small city where his family is “just for a few years,” and now says we might move to the big city later. It feels like I can’t rely on what he says, and that makes me nervous.

After we got married, he asked what I’d need to feel okay moving and I just kept avoiding the conversation because I charge confrontation and just hoped the issue would go away. Then, while I was 6 months pregnant, he quit his part-time job in the UK to go to Morocco for a few months for business. I went with him then, and he promised when we came back, he said he’d find a job again that it would be easy for him too, but he only looked for a bit and decided his business was doing well enough that he didn’t need one.

He used to give me £200 a month as spending money. Now that I have a small business which he helped me start, I pay £400 a month toward rent. I make around £1000 a month. So with the move coming up, I’ve been putting off talking about how I really feel because I’m scared. Every time I bring up how he broke his original promise, he says “things change” or “you made promises before marriage too,” which feels like comparing apples to oranges. He also says things like “I’m the husband, what I say goes,” and uses religion to back that up. I try to calmly say, “That’s not how it works,” and just drop it before it turns into a fight.

Finally, I realized I do have some terms under which I’d feel more comfortable moving. So we sat down for a talk. Maybe it wasn’t the best way, but I tried to structure it so my later suggestions would sound more reasonable. I told him first that I love him, that this isn’t me against him, but about finding a solution that works for both of us. I said one option could be me staying in the UK with our daughter for 3 years while he goes to Morocco and builds things up, just so he could keep the promise he made to my dad about waiting 5 years. We’d live with our families and save money to buy a nice house later.honestly I knew he would say no to this and I thought that this would make my actual offer the option to see more reasonable and he would be happier with it overall which probably shows my age and my naivety but I thought it was a good idea.

He was silent.

So I moved to option 2. Me staying just one more year here, learning the language, building more support, saving some money. I didn’t even get to explain the reasoning properly because I rushed through it after seeing he wasn’t reacting.

I asked him what he was thinking and told him it was okay to talk. He said it would be easier if someone stabbed him in the back twice than to hear what I said. He told me that if I could be away from him and take our daughter away for that long, it proves I don’t love him. He said he doesn’t know if he’ll ever believe I love him again. Then he told me to give him his bag and left the coffee shop. I kept pleading with him to stay and talk, but he calmly said “I can’t right now” and left.

He went to a meeting with his friends that was already scheduled and I think he’ll be back by 8pm tonight. I feel awful. My mom says he’s being immature, that he broke the original promise and is acting like a victim, but I also feel he’s really hurt. She also doesn’t like him much because of some stuff that happened after I gave birth, so I’m not sure she’s being objective.

A few important things
Our daughter was a surprise, I was on the implant, but a very happy one
I worry that once we move, I’ll lose the freedom I have here. Morocco isn’t exactly known for its feminism and I’m scared that some of the progress we’ve made in our relationship will go backwards
But I love him and want him to be happy 
I don’t know what to do now. I feel like I hurt him, but I also don’t know if I was wrong to say what I said. Was I the asshole?

**— Not open to romance.**

Have you ever felt older than your age like you’ve lived several lives in one?

I’ve seen a lot, wandered far, met all kinds of people… and yet I still long for those rare conversations where things feel real. Where you can speak freely, without small talk or performance.

I’m looking for genuine connection, a sense of depth, and a willingness to exchange more than just surface-level banter.

A few things about me:

– Detached from the news

– Not heavy on social media (aside from Reddit)

– Obsessed with clean eating. I avoid processed foods as much as possible

– A lover of strong coffee and quiet mornings

– Passionate about reading and learning across a wide range of topics (especially History and Biography)

– Well-traveled and always curious

– I enjoy wandering without a destination

– Occasionally sip half a glass of Amarone della Valpolicella

– My go-to sports: rock climbing & jogging

1mfpcm9,https://i.redd.it/nwsl2tj1olgf1.jpeg,Review: Recreation discovery pack,"Was looking for Australian brands, came across this discovery pack, and got it looking forward to the two that contain fig (Undone & Sun-Kissed). Considering the discovery kit is only $54AUD and it comes with a $20AUD voucher towards a full bottle, it’s a pretty good value kit 


- UNDONE (fig, spice, amber) - green, bitter, spicy, woody. 3.5/5

- CALL ME VENUS (oud, rose, vetiver) - I wasn’t expecting to like this as I’m iffy on oud and vetiver. An earthy rose and oakmoss, saffron spicing it up, sandalwood for some creaminess. 3/5

- AT NIGHT WE DANCE (musky, spicy floral) - thyme, lavender, clove and soft florals. Has a nice woody base, it’s a very aromatic and spicy floral, but there is a slight mustiness holding this back for me. 2.5/5

- JOYEUX (tuberose, jasmine, peony) - I’m not a fan of jasmine or tuberose so I wasn’t expecting to like this, and I was right. A big ole white floral bomb. 1/5

- LOST IN DUSK (vanilla, spices, coffee) - definitely get the coffee and vanilla, then some  juicy plum creeps in there. Just sweet enough to offset the bitterness of the coffee, this is really nicely balanced. 3.5/5

- THIS LOVE OF MINE (gardenia, jasmine) - Again wasn’t expecting to like this, it’s white floral dominant. There’s some basil and I’m getting a pear smell (not a listed note), I feel like if the white florals were replaced with rose or iris or lilac I would love this. But alas, 1.5/5

- STARDUST (lemon, thyme, geranium, sandalwood) - Thought I’d love this but it’s quite forgettable. Aromatic, citrus, woody. 2.5/5

- SUN-KISSED (fig, pear, lemon myrtle, jasmine). - Loving the lemon myrtle and pear and fig, unfortunately that jasmine isn’t hidden enough for me to forgive. It’s useable, but damn I would love this if it weren’t for the jasmine. 2.5/5

- L’HOTEL (rose, peony, vanilla) - There was a sample in the package outside of the discovery pack, called L’Hotel. No notes listed for it and I couldn’t find it on their site. I give it a smell and it was an immediate WOW. A deep dark vanilla, soft florals, warm woody musky base but never dusty. I loved this enough that I emailed them and asked them about this sample, they replied it was an unreleased perfume that was being launched in a couple weeks. So I kept checking back, and then bought a full bottle of this the day it came out. 5/5 


Recap: 
Love: L’Hotel

Like: Undone, Lost In Dusk, Call Me Venus

Use sample then forget: At Night We Dance, Stardust, Sun-Kissed

1mfpc3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mfpc3e/i_just_gave_someone_the_wrong_directions/,I just gave someone the wrong directions.,"I was standing at the coffee machine in a gas station and overheard a guy asking the clerk for directions to an ATM. The clerk said that he is not from around this area and had no clue to where the closest ATM is. As my coffee was coming out of the machine i walked up to the guy and gave him clear cut directions to the nearest ATM, continue this road, first round a bout right, first street left and all the way straight untill you will see a small shopping area and there you will find the ATM. He was happy and thankful and i was glad to be able to help someone out. I walked back to the machine and as i grabbed my coffee i realized that it is not the first but the second round a bout right. I hurried outside to see if i can still see the guy but he had already left. 

I feel so silly giving him the wrong directions although it was unintentional. I'm sure he will find his way but it does bother me. 

Nothing major but felt like sharing it as i'm drinking my coffee, silently hoping that i still see this guy so i can make it right but hope slithers away as my coffee is near to finish. ",0,1754137676.0,offmychest,1,0.25,False

They both were scheduled to arrive yesterday. We assembled the couch and coffee table and love them… however the chairs never showed up. Last night I got a text that said they’re delayed to 8/2 (today)…no big deal. But now today it just says “delayed”… no scheduled delivery date. Has anyone had this happen? Did the item ever come?

# Biggest Candle 2025: Top Picks & Buying Guide

The fascination with candles transcends mere illumination.In 2025, the ""biggest candle"" is more than just a source of light; it's a statement piece, an olfactory centerpiece, and a symbol of indulgence. Buyers are increasingly seeking candles that offer extended burn times, captivating fragrances, and notable aesthetics to transform living spaces into sanctuaries of relaxation and sensory delight.

This buying guide focuses on oversized candles that promise to deliver beyond expectations, acting as both functional lighting and remarkable decorative accents.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a truly exceptional oversized candle involves a careful examination of several key features that determine its value and longevity.

**Wax Type:** The type of wax used significantly impacts a candle's burn time, scent throw, and environmental footprint. soy wax, derived from soybeans, is a popular choice due to its clean burning properties and biodegradability.Paraffin wax,a byproduct of petroleum,is more economical but can release soot and potentially harmful chemicals. beeswax, a natural wax produced by bees, offers a long, slow burn and a subtle honey-like aroma. Coconut wax,derived from coconuts,is known for its exceptional scent throw and clean burn.

The choice of wax ultimately dictates the performance and environmental impact of the largest candles. Selecting a wax like soy, coconut, or beeswax ensures a cleaner, more lasting experience compared to paraffin options.

**Wick Material and Count:** The wick is the backbone of any candle, responsible for drawing the molten wax up to fuel the flame. Larger candles often require multiple wicks to ensure an even burn pool and prevent tunneling, where the wax burns down the center leaving a ring of un-melted wax around the perimeter. Wick material also plays a key role; cotton wicks are common, while wooden wicks can provide a crackling sound that adds to the ambiance.

The number and type of wicks are critical for maximizing the burn efficiency and overall enjoyment of oversized candles. Multiple wicks are essential for even melting, preventing wax wastage, and ensuring a uniform scent throw across the entire surface.

**Fragrance load and Type:** The fragrance load, or the concentration of fragrance oils in the wax, determines the candle's scent throw – the ability to fill a room with its aroma. Fragrance types range from natural essential oils to synthetic fragrance blends.Essential oils offer a more subtle and natural scent,while synthetic blends can provide a wider range of aromas and often have better staying power.

Selecting a candle with an appropriate fragrance load and preferred aroma compound is essential for a fulfilling experience. Balancing scent potency with personal preferences ensures a harmonious and non-overpowering atmosphere.

**Container Material and Design:** The container holding the wax also plays a significant role in the overall aesthetic and safety of the candle. Glass jars are a popular choice due to their durability and transparency, allowing the candle's glow to shine through. Ceramic containers offer a more rustic and artisanal look, while metal tins are lightweight and portable. The design of the container should complement the candle's size and intended purpose.

Beyond aesthetics, the material of the container must withstand the heat generated by a large candle. Heat-resistant glass or ceramic containers are crucial for safety and preventing cracks or other damage during extended burn times.

**burn Time:** One of the primary factors consumers consider when buying a large candle is its burn time. Burn time is estimated based on the amount of wax, the type of wax, and the number of wicks.Larger candles, by virtue of their size, naturally offer longer burn times, allowing for extended enjoyment and value.

A longer burn time translates to fewer replacements and more sustained aromatic benefits. Consumers should carefully consider a candle's burn time estimate to ensure it aligns with their lifestyle and desired frequency of usage.

Key features of the Biggest Candle 2025 models include:

*   Extended burn times surpassing 100+ hours
*   Superior scent throw capabilities covering large spaces
*   Use of premium, eco-friendly waxes like soy or coconut
*   Multi-wick designs for even wax distribution
*   Elegant and heat-resistant container options

## Core Benefits

The allure of oversized candles extends far beyond their impressive size,offering several practical and emotional benefits that contribute to their popularity in 2025.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** The sheer visual presence of a large candle instantly elevates the ambiance of any room. The soft, flickering light creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, making it ideal for relaxation, entertaining, or simply unwinding after a long day. The combination of light and fragrance can transform a space into a sanctuary of tranquility.

The generous glow of an oversized candle creates a focal lighting point within a room.The soft, diffused light emanating from a large candle produces a calming and pleasant ambience that is unmatched by smaller conventional candles.

**Long-Lasting Fragrance:** The larger wax pool allows oversized candles to release fragrance consistently and for an extended period. This means you can enjoy your favorite scent for days, even weeks, without needing to constantly relight or replenish. Weather it's a soothing lavender, an invigorating citrus, or a cozy wood scent, a large candle ensures a continuous aromatic experience.

The ability to burn continuously for hundreds of hours translates into a constant aroma in the household. This eliminates the inconvenience of daily candle management and maximizes aromatic enjoyment for weeks at end.

**Statement Piece:** An oversized candle is more than just a functional item; it's a decorative statement piece that can enhance the aesthetic of any room. The impressive size and elegant design often make it a conversation starter and a focal point in the decor. Whether placed on a coffee table, mantelpiece, or bookshelf, a large candle adds a touch of sophistication and luxury to the space.

The size and visual impact of a large candle makes it a prominent decor fixture within a household or event space. These candles serve as striking visual centerpieces capable of creating a focal point and improving aesthetic cohesion.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial investment may be higher, large candles often prove more cost-effective in the long run due to their extended burn times. Instead of buying multiple smaller candles, a single oversized candle can provide the same amount of fragrance and light for a significantly longer period.

Consuming fewer individual candles over a longer duration translates into lowered purchasing frequency. By purchasing a single large candle, consumers reduce replacement overhead and improve long-term cost efficiency.

## FAQs Section

**How long does a ""biggest candle"" actually burn?**
Burn times for these candles can range from 100 to over 200 hours, depending on the wax type, wick count, and fragrance load. always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for optimal burn times and safety.

**Are oversized candles safe to burn?**
Yes, if used properly. Be sure to place the candle on a heat-resistant surface away from flammable materials, keep it out of reach of children and pets, and never leave it unattended while burning.

**Can I reuse the container after the candle has burned out?**
Many high-quality candle containers can be repurposed after the wax has been entirely used.Clean the container thoroughly with warm, soapy water or by melting the remaining wax and wiping it out.

**How do I prevent tunneling in a large candle?**
To prevent tunneling, allow the candle to burn long enough for the wax pool to reach the edges of the container during the first few burns.This establishes a full melt pool and ensures that the candle burns evenly going forward.

My husband is super supportive and loving, im very well taken care of for context! I work 25 hours a week on my feet but im a super active person and have chose to be that active. I also walk my lab 2 miles per day (14 a week), and was a marathon runner prior to pregnancy. I’m doing what I can now but it’s not the same. 4 mile runs here and there and the gym are more wha it’s looking like. I’ve gained around 12lbs and im somehow…. So miserable? like in my own skin. I’m 5’2”, I look huge already and people ask how im due in December. Recently, my energy has TANKED beyond belief, like no amount of sleep or coffee would help, I can barely make it through a day. Funny though because come nighttime I toss and turn and maybe sleep 3-4 hours. I just feel “off” 24-7 and idk what to do. I never had morning sickness, just intense hunger and I feel fatigued, like I can’t “keep up.” With others. 

Is there anything I can do? Does it sound mental, like im struggling with a new way of life? i miss being able to RUN, Walk, not be in any sort of discomfort or pain, or have a huge belly that feels like it has a 2 liter of sprite sitting in it at all times.

1mfp7n2,https://i.redd.it/eonsponrmlgf1.jpeg,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read “I have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse”. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.



They all had titles hastily scribbled on, “Bad Mouse: Episode 1”, “Bad Mouse: Episode 2”, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading “This is the last”. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be “Bad Mouse”, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.



All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.



Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the “show”, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone’s pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.



That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading “From me to you, Bad Mouse”, the “I have something I love” being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.



The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.



“Bad Mouse is getting desperate!” a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.



Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words “Bad Mouse” arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse’s depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.



Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments…just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words “Getting desperate”, but only in syllables:



”Get…ting…des…per…ate”.



The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.



No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over…and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network’s channels were all hijacked.



By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.



The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.



Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.



""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.



The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.



Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children’s channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.



Others had…darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today’s world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.



Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.



By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.



How very wrong those people were.



For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived…



There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.



Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:



“i’m here”’



“is it getting desperate?”



“i hate you all”



“i have to get attention”



“i’m desperate!”



“you love me, but I don’t love you”



“bad mouse is getting desperate!”



“i’m going to show you the world”



“bad mouse is getting worse!”



“me me me me me me”



“attention”



Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be “death day”. Everyone’s blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.



Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone’s horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.



Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.



By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children’s networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel’s executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.



On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children’s shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.



In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.”



The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.



A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.



All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.



The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.



As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on “a little something” to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.



But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.



No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

1mfp59s,https://i.redd.it/marepcehblgf1.png,-62 pounds!,"ok so i’ve never actually posted about this before but figured it might help someone the way other posts helped me when i was just getting started. i’ve been on sebora for 7 months now, started at 14st 11lbs and today i’m 10st 7lbs which still feels completely surreal to write. i’ve been overweight since i was 14, tried every diet, every app, every influencer tip out there, nothing stuck longer than a few weeks. this has been the first time it actually felt... possible?

The first month i was nervous about the meds and had no idea what to expect. i’d heard people saying they “just weren’t hungry” anymore and tbh i didn’t really believe it, but it actually hit me fast. not like zero appetite but more like food just... wasn’t screaming at me all day. i could work without thinking about snacks every 10 mins. that alone felt life-changing. i think i dropped like 11lbs right off the bat but what really shocked me was how calm my brain got around food.

Month 2 and 3 were when i started actually eating meals instead of just grazing all day. high protein breakfast helped a lot, and the sebora app had some good tips even tho i didn’t always follow it 100%. i stopped binging, like properly, for the first time in years. i didn’t even realise how often i was doing it until it stopped happening. clothes started fitting differently too but i didn’t want to get excited too soon, thought maybe it was just water weight

Month 4 i hit a bit of a dip, not emotionally but weight wise. scale barely moved and i felt a bit stuck, started doubting if it was working or if i was doing something wrong. old me would’ve panicked and started cutting everything but instead i messaged sebora (shoutout to whoever writes their emails btw, they actually helped). added more fibre and volume food, less coffee (was overdoing that lol) and things picked up again after 2 weeks

By month 5 my skin started clearing up, my periods were getting regular again which blew my mind cause i’ve had pcos since uni and nothing ever helped long-term. i also started moving a bit more, just walking mostly but it felt good to do something. also i went to a friend’s birthday and actually ate normally, didn’t restrict all day before or go crazy after. i just... existed. ate some cake, didn’t freak out, didn’t spiral. that was a big deal

Month 6 i went on a weekend trip with my partner and for the first time i didn’t cry trying on outfits. i didn’t feel small exactly, but i felt okay in my body, which is honestly all i ever wanted. he noticed too, not just the weight but that i was smiling more, showing up more. i started posting again on socials without filtering every pic 15 times. my energy came back in ways i didn’t even expect, like my brain was quieter and i could think clearer

Now it’s month 7 and i’m 10st 7lbs. haven’t binged in 6 months. haven’t cried about food in even longer. still have moments of fear like what if i gain it all back or what if this is too good to be true but mostly i just feel proud. not just cause of the weight but cause i stuck with it even on the slow weeks, even when i wanted to quit. sebora didn’t fix everything but it gave me the boost i needed to actually do this without burning out

If you’re thinking about starting, or if you’re in that weird middle place where progress is slow and self doubt kicks in, pls don’t give up. this isn’t a quick fix but it can be a real one. happy to answer anything if anyone has questions, promise to be honest.",1,1754137088.0,SeboraHealth,2,1.0,False

I’d love to connect with a woman who’s open to a laid-back hangout, some conversation over coffee, or an impromptu stroll through the city.
