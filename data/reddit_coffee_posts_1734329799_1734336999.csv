1hfee9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hfee9a/th_part_of_something_bigger/,[TH] part of something bigger,"The lecture hall was modern, well lit, and plain in every aspect. The front of the room drooped lower than the back, although not enough to warrant stairs. On the ground laid a boring teal green and grey carpet offset with white lines jotted here or there. The wall, ceiling, and doors were all a putrid eggshell-white which reflected the florescent overhanging lights like mirrors. The room was layered within the larger complex so that windows would be impossible, apart from on the doors. Large desks made of plastic and cheap wood were on every level of the hall, resembling an oaky color with black rings for electrical wiring. Spinning chairs, also plastic, were of an olive green and black and were placed behind the desks. The room sat empty and quiet; it was jailcell.

Every level of mediocrity, down to the standard issue Dolby projector mounted to the ceiling, was an eyesore to the room’s professor. No matter how many times he had asked for a change in location, the administration staff refused his plea. He then asked for a slight remodel, maybe a different color paint, but such requests were outside the handbook. The professor had even asked to decorate on his own funding, also denied. For now, he was stuck in a room where time felt it could go no slower.

Despite failure, he made do and decorated the small industrial rolling desk with artifacts or trinkets that amused him. It was common for him to swap them out, but this day the desk had the skull of a white-tail deer, along with a matching pelt turned layover blanket drooping over the front side. The desk was empty apart from the deer’s attributes and a small collection of pens.

The professor arrived at his class early and began writing on a large whiteboard in the front of the room ‘NATURE’S BEHAVIOR’. He pulled out a modern laptop and pulled up a few videos of interest on separate tabs. He finally displayed a photograph, HD definition, on the board.

It showed a scene of struggle. A zebra, thrashing within what looked like a river or some other body of water, watching blankly and in utmost terror as his snout and skin was being torn away by crocodiles. The crocodiles, chucks of flesh limped within their clutches still attached to the zebra’s head, had zero expressions. The damage showed the entire snout and muzzle of the poor animal as being completely removed; skin completely removed from the bridge of the nose showing only skull. The lower jaw was mangled and chewed, with teeth missing, flesh ripped, ligaments dangling, and blood everywhere. The instantly recognizable zebra print skin was still attached, thrown about in the crocodile’s clench, and was torn like paper. The skin was ripped all the way down the face, stopping just as the muzzle ends and the lower eye lid begins. The water below had turned maroon. Death was immanent, and the zebra’s suffering was catastrophic.

When the first student arrived, about fourteen minutes early to the lecture, they walked in on their phone but were immediately shocked by the imagery, doing a double take before whispering ‘Jesus’ under their breath. Another, a few minutes later, was visibly shocked and kept darting their eyes on the grotesquery morbidly curious. As more students walked in, the reactions were just as repulsed, until a woman in the back asked, “Why is that on the board?”

“… Did anyone have any questions about the assigned readings?”

The class was silent and kept their eyes away from, or attached to, the zebra.

“Perfect”

The class became full. Many students were visibly discomforted by the image, but the professor was more focused on the distraction it gave him to the ugly room. He began his lesson on time.

“This seems just about everyone. I have started the online recording for our friends who could not make it due to their situation, reminder, if you need the lecture you need to ask for it. I can give it to you if you can give me a reason to give it to you. I am really getting tired of getting email’s saying ‘sorry I’m sick’ after the lecture already ended. If you need it because of scheduling that’s fine, if you get sick that’s fine, but if I see you sent your email an hour after the class is done, it’ll be as if I never saw it at all. You need to coordinate these things with me beforehand, so from now on if I don’t get an email before four in the afternoon, your lecture recording request isn’t happening. Sorry for that little rant, did anyone have any pressing thoughts on our friend, Breed?”

A hand jumped and a man asked, “I read it, it seemed like it only had to say animals will act like animals … is that right?”

The professor had a plain look on his face. “Well … yes. Morgan’s Cannon, *do not over-credit animal tendencies with humanlike capacities, always look for the simplest explanation.* In fact, Morgan goes further in his original 1894 text, writing, *in no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one that stands lower in the psychological scale…*”

“Doesn’t that … I don’t know … it just feels wrong to consider an animal as nothing more than serving basic needs.”

“True, and to be clear Morgan’s point of view is nothing more than a point of view, but it is one to make our lives much easier. It’s our Occom’s Razor. Thinking with too much humility will lead to us placing our own emotions and feelings on the templates of minds who cannot comprehend them; I can tell you that no animal has ever felt melancholy, or grateful, at least those in the wild, so looking at animals as these ‘thinkers’ does no good. On the other hand, they are not unfeeling piece of flesh. They get scared, and show happiness, and anger … but it’s not to the complexities that we feel. Thinking of animals like cogs leads to a life of misunderstanding, and subsequently mistreatment. Does that answer your question.”

“Basically … thank you”

The professor wrote on the board ‘MORGAN’S CANNON 1894’ along with, ‘GEORGE ROMANES’, and said, “Breed’s other books talk about this more, along with Romanes, poses great questions about what does an animal think … contemplatively. Anyone else?”

“Do we have to stare at that photo for any longer?” said the woman in the back.

“Is it too graphic?”

“It’s disgusting”

“It’s nature, that happens every day”

The woman stayed silent and visibly upset.

“How do humans die?”

No one answered.

“Ok … too broad, how do we often die?”

A young man raised his hand. He sat in the middle and wore casual clothes yet presented himself professionally. He would have seemed naturally comfortable in formal wear. He said “Cancer … disease,” with a mixed eager and confusion.

“Yes perfect, disease, old age, suicide, car crashes, accidents, murder … what a blessing we live comfortably. We do not know what cold means, or hungry, scared, fear, horror; we do not have the ability, or at least very few humans do, to comprehend authentically our primitiveness. We have the luxury to know that, beyond reasonable doubt, out last moments will be quick, painless, in our sleep, hopefully all three. The most modern and cruelest viruses can be numbed with enough morphine and the grizzliest deaths occur quick. Fractions of fractions experience the vicarial.”

Most of the class had figured out why the photo was on the board at this point.

“Our pain is usually emotional. We can’t pay our rent, our girlfriend broke our heart, our mom or dad died, our bosses just fired us. Yes, mental pain is pain, but physical, agonizing torture, that is suffering. That is the fate of nature. Animals don’t get to die quick, and painless, at least not those we study here. These creatures die like this,” pointing at the photo, “it is bloody, it hurts, and its terrifying. They are eaten alive.”

 

 

The rest of the lecture was standard. After the professor’s introduction he removed the photo and put on his presentation. His ZOO 342 class, *Animal Behavior and Ethology*, continued on the readings, looking over major breakthrough studies within nature’s psyche. The class were evidently engaged from the first second and stayed engaged throughout the remainder of the ninety-minute class. The last minute came quickly and cut the discussions short.

“If anyone wants to continue this discussion I can stay after a bit, but I know its 5:30 and you all want to get out of here,” said the professor.

The majority of the class packed and left. The young man came up and faced the professor, who lifted his head from cleaning his desk. “I had a quick question, the zebra, did it survive?”

“No, but it fought like hell, something I bet most of us couldn’t do. An animal’s only goal is survival, no matter how much it hurts.”

The young man thanked the professor and left the room. A few straggled and left slowly. A girl, blonde, young, and thin, was in the back and stayed seated, staring at the professor.

 

 

They met later that night at a bar. He had removed his jacket and put on more casual clothes. He smelled different, and his hair had been reshaped. He had chewed mint gum the whole walk from his apartment to the bar and walked quickly. It was dark and cold in the city, puddles in the road. It was September.

The two shared a drink and talked in the busy bar. The girl had the same thing on from the class but too had altered their presentation. She said something about this being her favorite place in town, but she preferred it when it was quieter and less busy.

“I went here when it had a different name … maybe three years ago.”

“What was it called?”

“I don’t remember, something tacky and Irish”

“Sounds boring”

“You weren’t there, it was fun, more tables though”

The conversation felt forced, and the professor immediately regrated the entire thing. He had begun darting his eyes everywhere except the woman in front of him, checking on the beer he had, or if the people to his right were still there. His uneasiness and general annoyance were to the point of becoming rude. After a silent ten seconds, he asked her, “How are you liking my class?”

“It’s good”

“Good”

She began to hate every minute of this too. Maybe it was the fact that this man had absolutely no ability to small talk. Even still, that wouldn’t be a major problem, small talk is a façade. She knew he didn’t want to be here, and, in that emotion, it made her not want to be there, making him not want to be here either more. It was a spiral, each person becoming more unwilling to keep this charade afloat.

“I don’t like getting drinks with students,” the professor said blunt.

“I don’t like getting drinks with teachers”

“Then why did you invite me?”

“Then why did you come?”

“I have a rather busy morning tomorrow”

“Same”

The energy of the bar was still intense as the woman grabbed her bag and coat and swiftly trotted away. The man had realized she left without paying her tab, but luckily it was only a matter of a drink or two. Much like the classroom, this too became like a prison, situationally. As he paid and left, walking back home, he realized that she will be at his class for the rest of the semester. He wasn’t sure who made it awkward but that awful tensity will be there for at least three months. He started to wonder if he could just fail her and not have to deal with them again, or if he made assigned seating and placed her behind a really tall student in the back, or anything to make sure he didn’t have to deal with it again.

The man pulled his phone out and texted her, having her number from the class earlier. He began to type “*Thanks for making me pay for your tab…”* but deleted it before sending it, as that would make his situation that much worse. He thought for a second and typed, *“This won’t affect your grade btw”* but that had just the same problem, maybe even worse that the first one. He then typed *“Wanna just forget about this”* and sent it before he could think about the repercussions.

*“huh?”*

*“Like the whole thing just a minute ago, pretend like it never happened?”*

*“ig idk”*

*“What do you mean”*

*“u were weird”*

*“I was at a bar I don’t like talking to a nameless student, sorry it wasn’t romantic or whatever you wanted it to be”*

*“nameless? Excuse me?”*

This was not going well and he had to take a minute to think about how he was going to deal with this. He began typing, *“I’m sorry, I just mea……”*

*“fuck you creep, you went to a bar with a girl almost half your age, u like preying on little girls? kys”*

 



The man got back home, kicked off his shoes and crashed on the couch. His apartment was neat, yet empty, and rather unimportant to him. He only kept this particular apartment because the hassle of moving his limited furniture, bed, and tabling through a doorway too small was hard enough once. The floorplan was like a giant ninety-degree angle, being placed on the corner of the building on the fourth floor. He would walk in from the hallway and immediately have to turn left from his makeshift mudroom area into his bedroom. It wasn’t even a room, just another area, as the apartment had very little walls, only blocking off the bathroom and a small half wall near the kitchen. His bed was neat and full sized, in the corner, so he could look around and see a nice view as he was sleeping. Turning left again there was a large leather couch only a few feet away from the bed against the outermost wall with a nice tv on the opposite wall. The bathroom and kitchen were in the back of this L shaped place. It was empty, and the fake hard wood flooring had no rugs to hid it. On his walls was not a single photo, and there was no life in here apart from him. A coffee table was empty, save two Ducks Unlimited magazines over a year old. It was all ever so clean and cold.

His only decorations were mounts. Too many of them. It was to the point that one could mistake the wall behind the TV with a museum of big game. Buck, white tail deer, moose, a bear, a wolf, a bison, multiple trout, and a side table of skulls and antlers. Many times, guests would come and audibly be shocked at his collection of carcasses. They all were on wooden plates with only a date etched and torched in. This place, this apartment, was not a haven or a retreat, but a trophy room.

As he sat, he thought about what the woman had said, *u like preying on little girls?* It was obviously misleading. He was barely thirty-five and she couldn’t have been younger than twenty-one. Many have made that age gap worked. He wondered, why did he even go in the first place. Yes, she was attractive, but he knew that the second he was in the room the excitement would be over, and she would open her mouth, and he would remember why he didn’t even know her name at the beginning of the day. The chase of it all was the most enjoyable part of it. The feeling of going after her, with the sense of risk that came with it. Nothing illegal or sinister, but definitely taboo. Even if she hadn’t been as attractive as she was, she was a student, and he was a professor. It was a hunt. An artificial one at best but something he had been avoid of for what felt like months, and he had gotten sloppy, like a tiger who lets their prey free before pouncing. He could have done so much better, paid attention to what she was saying, look her in the eyes, complement her on her looks, smile, be charming, be able to be charmed. Truthfully, he didn’t care for her much and had very little time to prepare or think through the whole situation, leading to the disastrous end.

He began to look again at the mounts on his walls. Each one of them was an animal he had slain himself. There were opportunities for him to collect other’s trophies but even thinking that was disingenuous. Everyone, a bullet he had cocked, an arrow he had drawn, a knife he had stabbed. It was necessary for him to have been responsible for the bloodshed. A feeling of satisfaction, curing his needs. That of the lion, jaw clenched on the neck of a wild buffalo, slowly chewing and licking at the wound as the buffalo wails and cries and collapses down in pain, just for the lion to release for just a split second to tear away at the jugular in a different spot. His lockpick was violent, and his gate door was a civilized façade.

That girl meant nothing to him, and he had already forgotten everything about her. There are millions of women that he could go after with much better attributes, intellect, style, and sense, and chances are he could find one quick. He knew how to try, and he had a fortunate face and body. It didn’t even need to be that of lust, he just needed to hunt, something. Someone. Luckily it was September, and he could venture off to the woods to bandage his aching.",1,1734336344.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

","Hello, I am looking for a funny, chill friend to voice chat with throughout the day.

Another day, going to work with many songs stuck in my head, trying not to sing too loudly so I won't annoy people on the street.

I get to the office quickly and start filling my brain with coffee, doing some tasks before a meeting in a few minutes, and then diving into my work.

It’s quiet here, and it gets lonely sometimes, so I decided to go on Reddit to convince you to be my friend. As a guy who isn’t a “20F blonde looking for friends maybe more 😉,” I barely get any responses, haha. But it’s a lot of fun when I do get a response and make new friends. I’m willing to try harder, which I don’t mind.

So I just posted and I am waiting for you to reply. I’m wondering what kind of person you are. Are you silly like I am, or more serious but still able to laugh?

Once we start talking, the conversation will flow nicely. We can chat about life and work, vent about the people in our lives.

We can explore our agreements and disagreements—be prepared for my honest opinions about everything, especially if you say that stars in the sky can tell what our personalities are like, lol.

We can joke around and chat a lot; if the vibe is good, we’ll have our inside jokes.

But if you don’t DM me, I’ll just keep winning arguments I had with my exes in my mind or continue freaking myself out with true-crime stories.

I made this long on purpose because I like people who enjoy reading, haha. Wishing you a great time anyway!	",1,1734336301.0,VoiceChats,0,1.0,False

Another day, going to work with many songs stuck in my head, trying not to sing too loudly so I won't annoy people on the street.

I get to the office quickly and start filling my brain with coffee, doing some tasks before a meeting in a few minutes, and then diving into my work.

It’s quiet here, and it gets lonely sometimes, so I decided to go on Reddit to convince you to be my friend.

1hfeah7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Posture/comments/1hfeah7/mysterious_breathing_and_joint_pain_problem/,Mysterious breathing and joint pain problem,"Hello everyone, trying to figure out what the hell is going on with me. It all started this past November when i woke up ij the middle of the night with shortness of breath. Seemed like i was having a panic attack but it took hours to wear off before I could finally go to sleep. Felt like my heart was going to explode (spoiler alert it didn’t). The next day i was back to feeling normal. Had coffee and breakfast, a lovely morning and then went about my work day. As I headed to my jobsite it seemed like another breathing attack was occurring. I had been working in a dusty renovation project for several weeks (years really) so I thought maybe allergies had just triggered some asthma. I go to urgent care feeling like I couldn’t breathe especially because a mysterious nasal congestion episode had started in the mornings when i’d wake up which had never happened before. Expecting the urgent care doctor to chalk it up to something simple, she goes “uh oh you need to go to the ER” I say “WHAT…why?” She says something isn’t right with your EKG. I say well what is it like a panic attack or stress she says no. I had “inverted t waves with possible ischemia”. Instead of going to the ER I went to another urgent care where the doctor who had more experience with ekgs said “this is normal, it’s transient and non specific and the chest pain you’re having seems like costocondritis”
Oh alright! I brushed it off and by the end of the day i mostly felt ok but a little sore. Throughout the week i noticed there was a difficulty reaching the top of my breath like I was oxygen starved. My oxygen levels and blood test were normal. Chest x ray negative. Though at this time my blood pressure was about 150/100 or so and usually its at a 130 so my bp is on the higher side (i’m 5’10 170 lbs so pretty normal/thin but cholesterol on the higher side of normal). I was mostly ok at this point since I felt like ok maybe I have a virus or something though no cough. The weekend comes and on Saturday night i’m in so much discomfort and breathlessness I have my friend take me to the ER in the middle of the night. The doctor sees me and gods you’re ultimately fine it’s just stress. My Bp had peaked to 170! But after the doctor came it went back down to 130 so clearly i was nervous and stressed. I was able to go home and sleep normal and started feeling a little better. I saw my pcp a few days later he chalked it up to stress and asthma thorough he was concerned with my latest ekg from the er which did in fact show more evidence of inverted t waves and possibly ischemia + tachycardia than the previous ekg so he refers me to the cardiologist just to be sure. The weekend comes. i stay up late, drinking with friends and each night I feel worse and worse. I normally drink weekends once a month or so when I’m feeling social and not too busy. So i figured i’d feel better…i didnt and starting getting intense chest and back pain on top of the shortness of breath and “stuck” feeling that i was missing my ability to reach deep breaths. It felt like my bodyweight was suffocating myself and i couldn’t find a comfortable position to sleep in no matter what I did, i felt like i was suffocating on my own weight. Sleep was impossible and no matter how i tried sleeping i couldn’t so now insomnia episodes started plus the bizarre sinus/nasal congestion. I thought to myself could i have been slowly suffocating in my sleep due to nasal congestion since I cant usually sleep unless i breath through my nose. By the following weekend i ended up back in the er which by now my ekg was back to normal and ER heart ultrasound looked normal and they just felt it was stress even though i was in so much physical pain. They gave me norco for costochondritis and sent me home. Now i had another problem—I couldn’t sleep at all no matter what. This exacerbated all my symptoms and just made me feel crazy. I kept being told it was anxiety and I believed it since I do have a highly stressful life with minimal self care. The norco wasn’t really helping and i kept having to wait it out. The sleep deprivation was causing my body to twitch and my brain to feel overloaded. It was pure hell. Eventually i started sleeping more and more and stopped sleeping on the uncomfortable pull out bed that seemed to trigger a lot of my symptoms. I’d wake up and my breathing muscles just felt so sore. Sleeping on my old mattress (my apartment was partially under construction so I moved to a completed job site though cleaned out was dusty so at this point i just figured id sleep in my old apartment since the new location wasn’t furnished except for the pull out bed) and id seem to improve the next day. By the time i started sleeping again, i realized wait…i dont have stress and anxiety this is something else! 

This is where it gets interesting. Desperate for answers I started digging and i realized, wait a sec! I was in a car accident 5 months prior and got harsh whiplash so for 3 months i went to the chiropractor who did some pretty harsh adjustments but it always felt good after. I never felt any serious pain afterwords but around the time i had moved 3months after chiro treatment i 1) stopped cold turkey 2) started sleeping on that uncomfortable mattress 3) started having the weird nasal congestion which seemed to mostly go away after i tried using propolis spray. So little by little it seemed i was improving and i finally bought a new mattress that seemed very comfortable though a little softer than my old one. The 1st night my body felt like it was adjusting to the new one the 2nd and 3rd nights it felt like i slept great! Though i was still having rapid heart beat episodes and felt like “gosh if i can just control my bp i bet the chest pain will go away” exercise felt good to do and so i started jogging more. Felt fine, a little better, then got back into work mode and stopped the exercise and healing focus. Then this time, the following week when the pain came back i had another episode of insomnia and “feeling like my body cant support its weight without suffocating” i figured out i need some exercise so a 10 minute jog 5mph a little inclined. This time exercise wasn’t feeling good afterwords and it seemed to trigger more breathlessness. Freaking out worried that i have some sort of degenerative disease though my blood tests and inflammatory markers were all normal. Seemed like my breathing mechanics were very sore and somewhat worse than the whole month.

So i’m assuming i actually have a misalignment and need to go back to the chiro. I dont know if the original chiro messed me up or what or if stopping going and sleeping on a crummy surface gradually screwed me up as simple as it sounds. Would love your insights and recs!!

","Hello, I’m trying to reach out for help. I have tried the last 18 years to get help for myself. I have been dealing with a lifetime of medical problems. I am a 55 year old male. I don’t think too clearly, get dizzy, and get headaches.  I have been fighting terrible sleep problems for many years. I’m always tired and run down. I have a You Tube video called Please Help Me I Need Medical Help that might also be helpful. I have been fighting my health and myself to prepare this.  I don’t smoke, drink or do drugs. I watch what I eat and drink.  I have been diagnosed and misdiagnosed for different ailments over the years. 

I have had lifetime neurology problems since after having chicken pox after the age of 4. I had bad chicken pox in the left side of my scalp and all over my face. I remember my mother saying it was very bad. My mother also had ovarian cysts removed around the time I was born. Since I was 4 years old problems top left side nerve scalp problems that first affected by right foot and then my legs. 

2 months ago I went to both the dentist and eye doctor visits and after their examinations my legs gave out on me and got bad headaches. I have problems for the last 7 years when I scratch nerve spots on left side of scalp, face and on my legs. They all generate toward my top left side of my scalp where I have had problems since I was 4 years old. One spot on my left hand caused bad head and neck problems or sensations. I thought I was going to have a stroke. It settled down 8 hours later.

I had a nerve spot on my left eyebrow that when I scratched it sent electricity up and down my legs to my feet. I have little blood spots all over my body and on the left side of my scalp.

I have had the left side of my face tighten on and off for the last few months.

My scrotum is look like leather.

I alternate between bad headaches and collapsing legs. My legs have been slowly diminishing for the last 20 years. I get dizzy standing with either my eyes open or closed. I tested positive 4 years ago for small fiber neuropathy.

My eyes have been light sensitive since I was 12. I have had burning 2 times in the center of my eye and I can get involuntary eye blinking or fluttering. I can get in my left peripheral vision either fireworks, diamond images or cracked glass that looks like rain coming down. I have blood shot eyes after I shampoo my hair in the shower.

A few moths ago during a 2 week period I had small clumps of hair on my shower curtain and in the tub.

 I have had 2 CT Scans in the past that have shown an undetermined cyst or a nodule problem in my left sphenoid sinus and maxillary area. I also had a CT Scan that showed an undetermined inflammation cell in my left eye.

I have had burning the last few months on the left side of my face, left side of nostril and left side of my lips. I did have burning after a recent bowel movement that affected my scrotum, anus, and butt.

I have had in the past yellow and blood mucous balls coming out of my left nostril.

My right foot has tightened off and on since I was 12 years old.

I had shingles in 2006 on my left waist and 2013 on the left side of my stomach.

My creatinine level is at 1.23 mg/dl. My PSA Prostate test is at 4.34H and my LDL-Cholesterol is high at 101 H. I went to the emergency room 8 months ago for my kidneys and threw up twice when I was there. It was the 2nd time in 4 years I had to go there for my kidneys. 

I have had burning and itching in my lymph nodes in my armpits and under both side of my jaw.

I have problems with my body temperature and I have been losing weight the last few years.

I do get once in a great while a silver metallic taste in my mouth when I turn my head to the right.

I have lost my memory a few times turning my head to the right and scratching my scalp. A few months ago I almost was ready to throw up when I touched the on the top left side of my head and the back left side of my neck. These were 2 separate incidents that happened close together.

I stopped drinking coffee and using spaghetti sauce. They caused severe violent headaches that I thought something was going to burst through. I still get bad headaches. I had problems 2 days ago with having tea with skim milk in the morning and had 2 apples at night. An hour after eating the apples I took 8 lysine capsules before going to bed. An hour after taking the lysine my right and then my left foot tightened and throbbed almost simultaneously. This was before going to bed and I had problems sleeping.

I have problems being in hot weather. I once was working outside in 90 degree weather and my adrenal glands were not working. My PCP thought I had Addison's disease. Went to the endocrinologist and he put fluid in me and things somewhat returned to normal. I also went outside in the hot sun one time and had a strip of area in the top left side of my scalp burning. I took antibiotics and slowly went away the few days after.

I get multiple colds all year long. My head and neck become so tight they feel like they are going to burst. For the last 7 years my Chiropractor, Osteopath and Physical therapist has said my neck and body is very tight to work on. My sleep is very bad. I get alternating sleep on different nights.

On December 17, 2023, August 2nd 2024, and August 29th 2024 something inside the left side of my head and neck had tried to shut me down while sleeping. I fought to stay awake and not shut down.

I did have have a high white blood cell count from taking IV Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and yellow liquid Atovaquone together. The doctor stopped them immediately.

My great grandfather died young at 48 years old from a lung ailment and my mother died from complications from sarcoidosis. I have once in a great while a spot on my upper back left lung that when I breath especially when I get a cold I can feel it. I tested for a few Sarcoidosis tests but have come back negative.

When I take out the trash I cant do it without by legs buckling and collapsing when I bend over to tie up the bag. I start to cough a lot when I bend over and crouch down.

When I do lay my head at night before sleep I feel some pressure on the left side of my head and neck

We can explore our agreements and disagreements—be prepared for my honest opinions about everything, especially if you say that stars in the sky can tell what our personalities are like, lol.

We can joke around and chat a lot; if the vibe is good, we’ll have our inside jokes.

But if you don’t DM me, I’ll just keep winning arguments I had with my exes in my mind or continue freaking myself out with true-crime stories.

I made this long on purpose because I like people who enjoy reading, haha. Wishing you a great time anyway!	",1,1734335631.0,Needafriend,2,1.0,False

My sleep quality has been terrible, my heart races all the time during performance reviews, I can't stop thinking about quota, and my weekends are consumed by more work stress.

Definitely not bashing the gig but it can get real stressful at times.

Good friend of mine at work noticed how overwhelmed I was and mentioned supplementing Taurine helps activate more GABA receptors in the brain to help relax.

Thought it would be some snake oil but figured I didn't have much to lose here. 

After a week of taking taurine regularly, I wasn't as jittery or overwhelmed as much anymore. My sleep has been a lot better, and the coffee doesn't affect me so negatively anymore.

I definitely feel more calm and at ease when I talk with clients and management. Ihave earlier taken modafinil from modafinia and was taking mexican coffee everyday but it was becoming too much for me.

I also had some periodic migraines which I noticed don't really occur anymore. And the stage fright from presenting to clients doesn't really happen anymore

It's far from a miracle supplement but I'm responding quite well and enjoying the benefits as it stands now.

If anyone's in a similar boat dealing with stress, I recommend checking it out. And if anyone has any other supplement recommendations that work better than taurine, please let me know!",6,1734335551.0,Biohackers,4,1.0,False

If you love your machine, it’s time to give it some TLC! 🛠️✨ A monthly deep clean, like backflushing with a cleaning agent, is essential for keeping your espresso machine running like a dream. And don’t skip the daily blind-basket backflush—here’s why:

🧼 Why Deep Cleaning Matters:
Every time you pull a shot, oils and coffee residues cling to your machine’s internal components—especially in the group head. Over time, this buildup can affect your espresso’s taste and shorten your machine’s lifespan. A good deep clean removes this grime, keeping your brews tasting fresh and ensuring your machine’s health in the long run!

💡 Backflushing Basics:
Daily blind-basket backflushing flushes out lingering residues in the group head, while the monthly deep clean with a cleaner takes it up a notch. It prevents blockages, improves water flow, and ensures consistent pressure for that perfect shot every time!

🛡️ Pro Tip for Longevity:
Treat your machine to this cleaning routine, and it’ll treat you to café-level espresso for years. Think of it as spa day for your espresso machine! 💆‍♂️☕

Have you cleaned your espresso machine recently? If not, here’s your sign to start! Tag a friend who might need this reminder or drop your go-to cleaning routine in the comments. Let’s keep those espressos clean and delicious! 🚀",2,1734335092.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.75,False

Recently got obsessed with Moka Pot as it peaked my interest and bought a Bialetti 6 cup Moka Pot as it is enough for making 2-3 regular cups. 

For my first brew: I had cleaned my Moka Pot with water brewing and discarding the first 2 coffee brews to get rid of the metallic smell or any metal residue as recommended by Bialleti. I used the Winter blend from Blue Tokai which ground to a little coarser consistency than an Espresso grind. Had put but hot water (90 degrees almost) in the base and filled the filter upto the brim without pressing it. Used a Bialetti induction plate on the gas stove for heating on low heat.

Overall, a successful brew with no bitterness as such when diluted with a little amount of water for drinking but felt a little more acidic for my taste.

Please give recommendations on my technique and any blends/ single estate coffees which tastes best in a Moka Pot. Thanks in advance! :)

Im living with a teenager who is a great kid shes not mine i want to help her. Shes 16 has anxiety issues. I want to help her grow up. Do chores, make food, make phone calls, get a part time job, budget. I know when she gets out on her own real life will hit her hard. Myself and her parent we set examples by working, doing chores etc but she refuses to follow the examples.

Her parent is doing all they can on mental health side of things counselling has been arranged and autism/ adhd assessments and every medical need shes had tests for everything from food intolerance to diabetes all negative. Now shes older she needs to take charge as they wont speak to parent on the phone and shes scared to make calls. 

I want to be supportive without over stepping the mark. Spoke to her parent and we agree things need to change starting with her cleaning her own room and moving on to giving her less money and budgeting. We thinking about sending her for classes in something to increase her confidence. Shes into wrestling so we thought wrestling and boxing classes. Maybe then she will feel more confident to get a part time job

The money is becoming an issue where we are now living week to week because her needs for spending are becoming greater as they do when you get older. 

Another issue is while i was doing her washing i found a receipt for victorias secret she spent £95 of the christmas money her parent gave her on lingere. We dont mind if shes got a partner we just want to meet them and also explain that £95 on lingerie is excessive while also making sure shes safe etc. 

The parent has approached her about the lingere she insists its to make herself feel good that she isnt seeing anyone. The patent has told her if shes seeing someone we would like to meet even just for a coffee as we care about her and want her to be happy. She went into a rage and now wont talk

And to be honest im getting tired of running around after her cleaning washing her dishes making her meals ( shes started to complain about the quality of food) and seeing the money dissapear. Shes going on a Christmas shopping trip with £300 from myself and her parent. I asked what she was getting her parent for xmas her response was "" well im getting myself xyz so i cant afford much"". I felt so upset for her parent when i relayed this information. Parent spoke to her and now i think shes getting something but i think it will be chocolates or a token.

Oh other things like she noticed some out of date items in the fridge instead of just taking them out she told me so i could remove them. She spilled a drink over the rug told me and i had to clean it. Her parent accidentally spilled something on her while servering her dinner she complained it runined her new pants and waited for my partner to get a cloth and wipe her pants down. Parent told her off after this. They had an argument. 

This is turned into a rant and im sorry. I dont know how to facilitate changes. We are both trying

Ariel Lawrence, a kind and honest girl, found out her wife was cheating on her. 

Being the honest, upstanding police detective I was, immediately I set to work. In my mind, I was reporting back to her frequently, letting her know every detail. At first, I found nothing - a common mistake, I thought, surely not every suspicion leads to a terrible truth. But then, sifting through the wifes work desk, fully prepared to let Ariel know there wasn't any proof... I found something damning.

A love poem, not sent yet - written by the wife. My throat went immediately dry, and I threw all hope away. Finding the initials, I searched the phone book and compared it to the address book. Finding an exact match, I sent my findings in. After which, I bought some coffee for Ariel, the least I could do to help somebody in obvious pain. 

Again, in my mind, we talked as she drank the coffee. We bonded, and I realized, I cared for this poor soul. As the days went by, solving two murders and a theft case, I'd stop by her home and say hi - chat about our lives. On the last day before The Red Demon case entered my life, I realized she was my closest friend I had in the city. Maybe my only one.

I awoke from another nightmare, sweating and gasping for air as a message came in, warning me of a murder that just happened. Grabbing my coffee, I ran by Ariels apartment by 3 am, assuming she was asleep inside. I got the case file as it was on the way, The Red Demon. A strange one, I thought. But, who am I to judge, in this damned city. Onwards I went, and entered the building, up to the floor... strange, it looked familiar... and us that... Ariel! Outside the apartment, I saw her frowning angrily, far more than I've ever seen her. 

An immediate red flag hit my mind, but I discarded it, this was Ariel! She'd never... but, this apartment, I'd definitely seen it before. Waving her goodbye, I entered through the police tape and it hit me. This was the home of the woman who Ariels wife cheated on her with! Surely she would never, I thought. Immediately I searched the body, finding the murder weapon next to it. A shaving razor, used to brutally slice up the woman. I'll just check the fingerprints, see what type they are an- 

Ariel Lawrence's.

My heart felt heavier than the city's addiction to Starch Kola. She did it, she carved up this woman, revenge or madness had gripped her heart.
Going to her home, I knocked on the door. Her wife, likely preparing for the divorce let me in. Ariel was home, looking nervous. I talked to her, pleading her to deny the claims. She confessed, and I felt the darkness of the city fall over my soul. Putting her in cuffs, I asked why she did it. I can't even tell you what she said, all i remember is turning the report in, and heading to the bar to drink. 

Blew the entire payment I received on drinks. What I couldn't drink there, I took with me. 
The Red Demon case, it took my friend, and my hope. Because if Ariel Lawrence would murder...

I wanted to share my experience exploring Miami's most popular spots and help those planning to visit this incredible city. After living here for several years and showing countless friends around, I've got some pretty good insights on where most tourists flock to.

Without a doubt, South Beach takes the crown as Miami's most visited area. It's that iconic stretch of Miami Beach that you've probably seen in movies and TV shows. The Art Deco buildings, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant nightlife make it a huge magnet for visitors from all over the world.

Ocean Drive is particularly packed year-round. It's like this perfect mix of beachfront paradise and urban excitement. During my walks there, I'm always amazed by the historic Art Deco hotels with their neon lights and unique architecture. The street comes alive at night with restaurants, bars, and music spilling out onto the sidewalks.

Lincoln Road Mall is another hotspot that pulls in massive crowds. It's this awesome pedestrian street filled with shops, restaurants, and street performers. I love grabbing a coffee and people-watching here - you'll hear languages from all over the world!

If you're planning to visit these popular spots, I recommend checking out https://athometouch.com/miami for some really cool guided tours and activities. They've got some great deals on South Beach tours that'll help you skip the tourist traps and see the real gems.

Downtown Miami and Brickell area come in as close seconds. The modern skyline, high-end shopping, and amazing restaurants make it a major destination. Bayside Marketplace is always bustling with tourists checking out the boats and enjoying waterfront dining.

Little Havana deserves a special mention too. Calle Ocho is like stepping into a different world - the authentic Cuban restaurants, cigar shops, and domino players in Maximo Gomez Park give you a real taste of Miami's Cuban heritage.

Honestly, there's so much to explore in Miami that it can be overwhelming. I've found that booking through https://athometouch.com/miami really helps in planning activities and making the most of your time here. They offer everything from food tours in Little Havana to Art Deco walking tours in South Beach.

Remember, while these areas are super popular for good reason, each neighborhood in Miami has its own unique charm. Don't be afraid to venture out and explore beyond the tourist hotspots. The real Miami experience is in mixing the famous spots with local hidden gems.

In any case, let me share my story.

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his nerdy quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.


So if you're a fellow lover of coffee, learning, and all things nerdy, this tall drink of water might just be the partner in crime you've been looking for. Dating at times feel like a job hunt doesn't it? So I thought it’d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into business and investments, frustrated law student, can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck (sarcasm towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha).

- I'm 5'10"", physically fit, resides in quezon city. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and hygienic

- I'm an INTJ, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in horoscope.

- Loves to read self-help books as I love to learn and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set feasible goals and actively pursue them.

Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism.

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

First, when I missed the livestream (due to timezone). I was depressed, but I eventually got over that and was feeling good once I got into the process of preparing my cupping. (First time doing this with more than 2 coffees BTW, and it's quite a process, especially with a hand grinder). I had to use 4 different bowls, which made it a bit more complicated, but I just measured the smallest bowl which was about 250mL, so I just used 12g to 200mL. Also, having 4 different sized bowls meant I had to set each bowl in turn on the scale while pouring the water, which complicated the whole thing and the timing.!<

>!So in all that confusion, I may have poured too aggressively (I'm using a pouring kettle though) and I kinda swirled it like when making a pour-over 'cause I was worried about saturating all the grounds. All of the coffees sank almost immediately with no crust, which made me panic and I thought I had botched the whole thing after all that grinding and measuring! After calming down a bit and letting them cool, it turned out they still tasted pretty good, and I just watched along with the livestream replay, and had a pretty good time after all. :D (This was my first global tasting experience as I had missed out on the first two) In retrospect, I'm almost glad I didn't watch live, because I would have been panicking trying to keep up with James, even though he gave us a little time to catch up.!<

>!My sister also tasted along with me, and she preferred the Swiss Water, which I had kinda predicted she would based on the roasty smell of the beans while grinding. She prefers somewhat darker/medium roasts usually. I was quite surprised that my favorite was the Ethyl Acetate! It just had slightly more acidity and *mild fruity notes*(hehe) than even the unprocessed, and stood out more than the other decafs. I've seen others saying this too (but not for everyone of course as all roasters are different) and I think even James said so. It tasted almost fermented. Very interesting. I would say my least favorite was the Swiss Water, but it's almost tied with the Carbonic Neutral. Again, the Swiss was more roasty, rounded, less acidic etc. which is not necessarily a bad thing, just not to my preference. The CO2 was sort of in between the EA and Swiss. A bit flat to me. I couldn't discern much about the body or finish as I'm new to cupping and also because I had already slurped up most of the coffee while thinking about acidity and sweetness LOL. It had also grown really cold at that point.!<

Overall this was a great experience and I would absolutely do something like this again given the chance! **Thank you to Reserva Roasters for the chance to buy a kit, and to James and his team and everyone else involved!! What an amazing feat!**",1,1734333092.0,JamesHoffmann,1,0.6,False
1hfdoj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hfdoj9/i_saved_myself_for_marriage_but_she_had_sex_and/,"I saved myself for marriage, but she had sex and abortion before she met me. ","Please reddit help me, I am in my wit ends since it affects not only my marriage but also my life as a whole. Sorry for the broken English since it’s not my first language, but I need to put it here, as I have raised this issue in my local reddit-like social media group, but the opinions polarized, so it probably helps if a neutral group comment on it, hopefully this is the correct place to seek help. Name changed of course for privacy.  

I 25M is married to my wonderful wife Nur 22F for less than a month but already the marriage is in tatter. I met her 3 years ago in my male cousin’s wedding where I was his best man and she was her bridesmaid, her best friend. Nur was the most stunning girl I have ever lie my eyes on, and I can see some of the guests especially the males can see that too. I whispered to my cousin, and he assured me he will talk to his wife and see what can transpire. Sure enough, a few weeks later I got her phone number and I messaged her casually, she replied saying that her best friend had already communicate to her and arrange for this.

After some conversations when we finally felt comfortable with each other, I asked Nur for a date, and after a while she said ok, but she wanted to bring her 10-year old niece along, and I said ok. We met at a local coffee shop and sure enough, both girls came, and she look even more stunning with less make up on and dress modest and casual. I think we hit the first date well, as when she returned home, she said she was happy with our date and I even made an impression on her niece, saying I am a good guy.

Afterwards, we went for more dates, and on our 4^(th) date I think, she asked if I can fetch her at home as she’s staying with her parent, and asked his dad If I can take her for the date. It’s a very big and beautiful house, I met his parent, and asked if I can take their daughter for a date. After much prodding, they let me took her, as long as we return before 12am, and the date went well just 2 of us in the restaurant. Later, she told me that her parent invited me for casual lunch with her whole family, we got a long really well and see that her family, whole being rich, is one of the most genuine and compassionate people.

I am a civil engineer in a construction company, making decent pay while having to pay for my rental room with my other roommates during that time, utilities, insurance, some loans such as study loan, car loan and now housing loan for my apartment, as well as paying for my family, particularly my single mother (my dad died when I was 17) living in the countryside, as well as my younger brother 20M in college and younger sister 17F in her secondary school, and finally my savings and investments. Nur on the other hand is studying for her bachelor degree in Business Management, and now in her final year doing her internship. She is the dean’s list student, got full scholarship and pocket money from her parent, and do side job as a part-time freelancer model.

We continue to date until a few months when she said that she fell in love with me, I am good guy and she vision our future together, and I of course was over the moon hearing it, reciprocating her feeling. For context, I have never been in a serious relationship, although I occasionally dated but nothing more transpired, and it never went beyond a few casual dinner dates. I consider myself as a somewhat in the middle, not too handsome nor ugly, not too poor nor rich especially with lots of financial commitments. She on the other hand is top tier. Not only she’s 10/10 in terms of looks even when she always wear modestly, she is also comes from a rich family, intelligent, bright, cheerful, humble and overall a good person, and I am lucky to be loved by her, although she admitted that she was hesitant at first when her best friend approach her about me, but she glad she gave me and her a chance, and now she is head over heels in love with me.

For context, in my country, sex outside of marriage is frown upon, and only sex between a husband and a wife is permitted. Although I am in no illusion thinking others follow the rules, at least it’s a taboo and people did it discretely. And as such, I saved myself for marriage, although I have some opportunities to not doing that, I abstain myself. I pride myself in this, and is not shy saying this to her when we dated, to show how lucky she was that I will be experiencing this with her for the first time on our wedding night, and how lucky am I to have her first too. She just smiled and nodded saying how lucky she is, to have me as her future husband, and asked me to always love and care for her and never leave her. And after this conversation, and after 1.5 years of dating, she asked if we can hold hands, and that’s the extent of our dates, just holding hands and nothing more, and in public places like restaurants’ cafes, beaches, park etc., never a private place and even if we went for holidays, we booked different hotel rooms.

After almost 2 years of dating, it’s time for me to propose, and the tradition says that I must go to her father and ask him for her daughter’s hand in marriage. And the dreaded talk about the dowry paid by the husband to his bride, in which I brace myself on the amount, given how perfect she is and there are some stories about her suitors before who came from rich backgrounds, all rejected by either her parent or she herself. To my surprise (and relief), he only asked me to pay the dowry equivalent to just 2 months of my wage, which is kind of cheap, saying that he didn’t need the money, he just want a good husband for her daughter, and think that I can fit the bill. By now he is practically my father and her wife my 2^(nd) mother, and I consider my gf’s siblings as my own. And for that, I was engaged with my then fiancée for about a year plus, until my wedding day when she becomes my wife.

Fast forward, I realized that a few months before the wedding day, I can see that my fiancée is somewhat looking sad and showing anxiety, but when I asked her what’s wrong, she just attribute it to being busy during the internship, as well as feeling anxious to be married, excited of course and look forward to marrying me, saying I am his one and only and to not leaving her ever, which I reply positively and lovingly. And then came the wedding day, she looked stunning as ever, guests reveling at her beauty and said how lucky I was to marry a woman of her caliber, which I replied as such, marveling on how a man like me can end up with a girl like her. At one time, I get a glance on her suddenly show a surprise face but quickly shifted to a happy and smiling face, but I think nothing of it.

And finally came the wedding night. I then realized that not only she is beautiful, but she’s also has a perfect body. Fortunately, while I am a virgin, I have done extensive research on the internet, err videos, as well as consulting my relatives and friends who have the experience, so I know what to expect and what to do. When we consummate our marriage, I realized one thing; she is not a virgin. And after we finish, I lie beside her, and casually asking “Nur, are you not a virgin?”, just thinking that she lost it doing sports, or even maybe she was not born with it. Suddenly her face switch from being shy, aroused and excited, to a shock, horror, and sad expression, before breaking down and repeatedly saying “I’m sorry, please forgive me!” I implore her to tell me the truth, and what she told me still haunted me to this day.

Apparently, I am her 2^(nd) bf, as she had her 1^(st) bf, Jay who is the same age as when she was 16, which she casually mentioned but never delved as it is in her past and a painful memory she wants to forget, so I don’t implore much on it. He is the lone son of her parent’s friend, eventually she and jay become friends too and later in relationship, with the blessing of both parents. While she is religious and save herself initially for marriage, after much coaxing from jay, and because she was in love with him in that moment and being naïve, she gave herself to him, having sex, and afterwards become intimate in every moment they get, and in all kind of sex just 2 of them (I started to shed tears hearing this).

This was going on for 3 years, and in the 3^(rd) years, 2 major incidents happened. One, Nur found out that she was pregnant with his baby for almost 2 months (I shed more tears hearing this), and confronted him about this. But instead of taking responsibility like what she expected, he instead freaked out, saying both of them were not ready to become parent, and pressured her to abort the baby, which she reluctantly did. They still continue the relationship but her opinion about him began to deteriorate. The 2^(nd) major incident that finally broke the straw, was when their mutual friend, particularly his friend, Matt, asked her to meet up as he wanted to show her something. And when they met at a local coffee shop, he showed her somethings that shook her to the core. Some videos and pictures of jay partying at night clubs, making out with random women and even him having sex with them, some with multiple men and women. and the conversations Jay had with a group of friends, where he boasted having her as her perfect gf, how he corrupted her from being pure to having sex all the times and in many styles, how she doesn’t want to drink nor being in those night clubs so she can be a stay at home wife and mother while he continues partying and sleeping around secretly, or coaxing her to join the night club, further corrupting her after their marriage.

This revelation broke her, and she asked if Matt can send this evidence to her, in which he replied yes. Armed with these, Nur showed to her parent, which in turn called in Jay and his parent to come over, where they have this heated discussion and everything were laid out on the table, including the sexual relationship and the abortion. Jay and his parent initially tried to deflect the situation, then went defensive, until finally they resolve to admit guilt and asked for forgiveness and 2^(nd) chances. Nur and her parent accept the apology, but decline to gave anymore chances to Jay even when he begged them and down on his knees saying he will change. The final resolution is Jay and Nur will not be in the relationship anymore, and ultimately broke the friendship of their parent too, and keep all of these a secret from outside of the group including Nur’s other siblings. Jay tried to apologize repeatedly to Nur and begged for 2^(nd) chance but Nur decline, and heartbroken, Jay goes abroad to further his education. Nur continued being single, declining romantic advances from many directions including from Matt, whose now his motive is clear, until her best friend arranged the conversation between her and me until we’re finally married.

I was clearly heart broken hearing this, and after much other conversation, I can’t take it anymore and decided to get some sleep, while she begged for forgiveness, saying how she loved me deeply and she will do anything to make up for it. I slept on the floor while she begged me to sleep next to her on the bed, doesn’t matter if we don’t have sex, just looking at me is enough for her. Needless to say, we don’t have much sleep that night, it showed the next day when we had breakfast with her and my family in her family’s house, and we’re teased a lot because of it, which we just politely went with the flow. As I am busy with some construction projects and her busy with internship, we planned to go for honeymoon once our schedule permits, but now it doesn’t seems so enticing to do.

After a few days in her parent’s home, we moved in our home, a tiny but cozy apartment that I bought. Our daily routine is as follows: in the morning I send her to her office before heading to mine, I fetch her in the evening and return home, she cooks, we eat, we both do the dishes, and us watching TV at the living room. Every time she tried initiating intimacy, we are up to it hot and bothered when I suddenly be reminded of her and Jay doing it all the time and all the way and then the abortion, and will choke and stop midway. She will be disappointed but understanding, crying and apologize profusely for her past, always iterate her love for me, will do anything for me so I can overcome it, and will wait until I am over it and hope we can reconcile if we give it time. We also share our bed now but nothing more than getting asleep, or the lack of it. This has been going on for almost a month. I waited for a week if it can pass, afterwards I tried to post anonymously on local channel but a staggering gap of replies between the local male and female led me to come here reddit if you can shed light on what is happening, and if there’s a way to mend it, maybe make it balanced somehow.

Although this common friend initially told her to drop me, I said no it'll not be practical. She seemed to agree.

Anyway then me and her were walking searching for cabs. I hailed a cab for her and opened the backseat door. She sat inside the backseat to the far end (road side) and then asked me ""can I drop you somewhere?""

* Makalu (8,485m) – the fifth highest mountain.
* Cho Oyu (8,188m) – the sixth highest peak.
* Ngozumpa Glacier – the largest glacier in Nepal.
* Gokyo Lakes – a series of pristine turquoise lakes below the summit.

This viewpoint offers a breathtaking 360-degree view of the surrounding Himalayan peaks, glaciers, and valleys, making it a highlight of the Gokyo Everest Trek.

**Accommodation options in Gokyo Trek?**

In Gokyo, accommodation options are basic but comfortable. There are several tea houses and lodges that provide a place to rest and meals for trekkers. The amenities typically include:

**Tea Houses:** These are the main accommodations, offering simple rooms with twin beds and basic blankets. Some may have private rooms, but shared dormitory-style rooms are common.

**Food and Meals:** Most tea houses provide local food like dal bhat (lentil soup with rice), noodles, and snacks, along with tea or coffee.

**Electricity:** Limited, and charging devices may incur extra charges.

**Hot Showers:** Some tea houses offer hot showers for an additional fee, but they are not always available due to the cold temperatures and remote location.

These accommodations are basic, so trekkers should be prepared for rustic conditions in exchange for stunning views and a peaceful atmosphere.

I was skeptical. Aren’t we all when it comes to promises that seem too good to be true? My days of chasing after quick fixes and miracle solutions were long behind me—or so I thought. Yet, here I was, staring at a product claiming to target something I hadn’t paid much attention to: liver health.

# [👉Click here to visit Liv Pure's Official website](https://tinyurl.com/2krak99n)

To be honest, I didn’t even realize how much my liver impacted my weight loss journey and overall well-being. I had been stuck in a rut, feeling bloated, lethargic, and frustrated. Diets would work for a while, then stop. Workouts felt like punishment, yielding minimal results. But something about this approach, focusing on detox and revitalization from the inside out, made me pause and say, ""What if?""

The first week was subtle. I didn’t experience any fireworks or overnight transformations, but something shifted. My digestion felt smoother, less bloated after meals. By week two, I noticed a gradual lift in my energy levels. I wasn’t reaching for that second cup of coffee by 11 AM. Instead, I felt… light. Not just physically, but mentally.

Here’s where things got really exciting. Around the third week, I hopped on the scale. The numbers hadn’t moved dramatically—just a pound or two—but my body *felt* different. Clothes that had been snug were now comfortable. My skin had a noticeable glow, and my energy had gone from ""barely surviving"" to ""thriving."" Friends started asking if I had changed something in my routine.

And I had. But it wasn’t just about losing weight. This was deeper. I realized my liver had been working overtime, bogged down by years of poor dietary choices and environmental toxins. The product wasn’t just about helping me shed a few pounds; it was about restoring balance and vitality to my body. Once I gave my liver the support it needed, everything else seemed to fall into place.

# [👉Click here to visit Liv Pure's Official website](https://tinyurl.com/2krak99n)

What truly sold me was the ease. I didn’t have to overhaul my entire life. No extreme diet plans, no back-breaking exercise routines. Just a simple addition to my daily schedule that delivered results steadily and consistently.

By the end of the second month, I felt like a new person. My waistline was noticeably slimmer, my energy stayed high throughout the day, and I had a mental clarity that I hadn’t experienced in years. The best part? It felt sustainable. No crash diets, no ""yo-yo"" effect. Just a steady progression toward the best version of myself.

If you’re like I was, tired of the cycle of frustration and ready for something that actually works, this could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. It’s not about chasing the next fad; it’s about giving your body what it truly needs to thrive. That’s what worked for me. And if you’re willing to take a chance, it might just work for you too.

Let’s talk science. Because once I started seeing results, I wanted to understand *why*. What made this product so effective where countless others had failed? The answer lay in its unique approach—targeting the liver as the key to unlocking better health and weight management.

The liver is a powerhouse organ. It’s responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing fat, and regulating energy levels. But here’s the kicker: when the liver gets bogged down with toxins, it struggles to do its job effectively. This can lead to fat storage, low energy, and a sluggish metabolism. Basically, if your liver isn’t functioning optimally, you’re fighting an uphill battle when it comes to weight loss and overall health.

Liv Pure takes a two-pronged approach: **detox and rejuvenation.** The formula is built on natural ingredients that are scientifically backed to support liver health. Ingredients like sylimarin (from milk thistle), berberine, and betaine are known for their liver-cleansing properties. These compounds help the liver eliminate toxins, reduce inflammation, and repair damage caused by years of stress and poor diet.

Then there’s the rejuvenation aspect. Once the liver is detoxed, Liv Pure focuses on enhancing its ability to metabolize fat and produce energy. This is where ingredients like chlorogenic acid and resveratrol come into play. These compounds help boost the liver’s fat-burning capabilities, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote cellular energy production.

Here’s what really stood out to me: the formula is rooted in research. There’s nothing random about the ingredient list. Each component has a specific role, working in synergy to create a comprehensive solution. The product doesn’t just tackle symptoms; it addresses the root cause of many health challenges—an overworked and underperforming liver.

What impressed me even more was how it worked without disrupting my daily routine. No crazy detox diets or harsh regimens. Just a simple, science-backed supplement that quietly got to work, transforming my body from the inside out.

The science gave me confidence, but the results sealed the deal. I wasn’t just seeing changes on the outside—I was feeling the difference on the inside. Better energy, improved digestion, and a metabolism that was finally firing on all cylinders. It was like my body had been stuck in first gear, and Liv Pure helped shift it into overdrive.

Understanding how Liv Pure works only deepened my appreciation for it. It’s not a quick fix; it’s a solution rooted in the fundamental biology of how our bodies function. And when you support your body the way it’s meant to be supported, the results aren’t just powerful—they’re life-changing.

**1. How long does it take to see results?**  
Everyone’s body is different, but most people start noticing subtle changes within the first couple of weeks. For me, the real transformation kicked in around week three. Consistency is key—stick with it, and you’ll see results.

**2. Is Liv Pure safe?**  
Absolutely. The formula is made from natural ingredients that have been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. Plus, it’s free from harmful chemicals, fillers, or artificial additives. Of course, if you have specific health concerns or are on medication, it’s always a good idea to consult your doctor first.

**3. Will it work if I don’t change my diet or exercise routine?**  
Yes, it works regardless of your current lifestyle. That said, I found that adding in a few healthier choices—like eating more whole foods and moving a bit more—amplified the results. Liv Pure isn’t about drastic changes; it’s about creating sustainable progress.

**4. Are there any side effects?**  
I didn’t experience any side effects, and most people report the same. Since the ingredients are natural and designed to support your body, it’s unlikely you’ll encounter negative reactions. However, if you have allergies or sensitivities, check the ingredient list to ensure it’s a good fit for you.

**5. Do I need to take it forever?**  
Not at all. Liv Pure is about restoring balance, not dependency. Once your liver is functioning optimally and your body is back on track, you can scale back. Some people use it seasonally as a gentle detox or whenever they feel their body needs a reset.

**6. Is it worth the investment?**  
If you’re serious about improving your health, absolutely. I’ve spent money on countless products that promised the moon but delivered nothing. Liv Pure was different—it worked. For me, the value far outweighed the cost because it gave me results I could see, feel, and sustain.

**7. What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
That’s the beauty of it—there’s no risk. Liv Pure comes with a satisfaction guarantee, so if it doesn’t work for you, you can get your money back. It’s as simple as that.

To be honest, I didn’t even realize how much my liver impacted my weight loss journey and overall well-being. I had been stuck in a rut, feeling bloated, lethargic, and frustrated. Diets would work for a while, then stop. Workouts felt like punishment, yielding minimal results. But something about this approach, focusing on detox and revitalization from the inside out, made me pause and say, ""What if?""

The first week was subtle. I didn’t experience any fireworks or overnight transformations, but something shifted. My digestion felt smoother, less bloated after meals. By week two, I noticed a gradual lift in my energy levels. I wasn’t reaching for that second cup of coffee by 11 AM. Instead, I felt… light. Not just physically, but mentally.

Here’s where things got really exciting. Around the third week, I hopped on the scale. The numbers hadn’t moved dramatically—just a pound or two—but my body *felt* different. Clothes that had been snug were now comfortable. My skin had a noticeable glow, and my energy had gone from ""barely surviving"" to ""thriving."" Friends started asking if I had changed something in my routine.

And I had. But it wasn’t just about losing weight. This was deeper. I realized my liver had been working overtime, bogged down by years of poor dietary choices and environmental toxins. The product wasn’t just about helping me shed a few pounds; it was about restoring balance and vitality to my body. Once I gave my liver the support it needed, everything else seemed to fall into place.

What truly sold me was the ease. I didn’t have to overhaul my entire life. No extreme diet plans, no back-breaking exercise routines. Just a simple addition to my daily schedule that delivered results steadily and consistently.

By the end of the second month, I felt like a new person. My waistline was noticeably slimmer, my energy stayed high throughout the day, and I had a mental clarity that I hadn’t experienced in years. The best part? It felt sustainable. No crash diets, no ""yo-yo"" effect. Just a steady progression toward the best version of myself.

If you’re like I was, tired of the cycle of frustration and ready for something that actually works, this could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. It’s not about chasing the next fad; it’s about giving your body what it truly needs to thrive. That’s what worked for me. And if you’re willing to take a chance, it might just work for you too.

Let’s talk science. Because once I started seeing results, I wanted to understand *why*. What made this product so effective where countless others had failed? The answer lay in its unique approach—targeting the liver as the key to unlocking better health and weight management.

The liver is a powerhouse organ. It’s responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing fat, and regulating energy levels. But here’s the kicker: when the liver gets bogged down with toxins, it struggles to do its job effectively. This can lead to fat storage, low energy, and a sluggish metabolism. Basically, if your liver isn’t functioning optimally, you’re fighting an uphill battle when it comes to weight loss and overall health.

Liv Pure takes a two-pronged approach: **detox and rejuvenation.** The formula is built on natural ingredients that are scientifically backed to support liver health. Ingredients like sylimarin (from milk thistle), berberine, and betaine are known for their liver-cleansing properties. These compounds help the liver eliminate toxins, reduce inflammation, and repair damage caused by years of stress and poor diet.

Then there’s the rejuvenation aspect. Once the liver is detoxed, Liv Pure focuses on enhancing its ability to metabolize fat and produce energy. This is where ingredients like chlorogenic acid and resveratrol come into play. These compounds help boost the liver’s fat-burning capabilities, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote cellular energy production.

Here’s what really stood out to me: the formula is rooted in research. There’s nothing random about the ingredient list. Each component has a specific role, working in synergy to create a comprehensive solution. The product doesn’t just tackle symptoms; it addresses the root cause of many health challenges—an overworked and underperforming liver.

What impressed me even more was how it worked without disrupting my daily routine. No crazy detox diets or harsh regimens. Just a simple, science-backed supplement that quietly got to work, transforming my body from the inside out.

The science gave me confidence, but the results sealed the deal. I wasn’t just seeing changes on the outside—I was feeling the difference on the inside. Better energy, improved digestion, and a metabolism that was finally firing on all cylinders. It was like my body had been stuck in first gear, and Liv Pure helped shift it into overdrive.

Understanding how Liv Pure works only deepened my appreciation for it. It’s not a quick fix; it’s a solution rooted in the fundamental biology of how our bodies function. And when you support your body the way it’s meant to be supported, the results aren’t just powerful—they’re life-changing.

**1. How long does it take to see results?**  
Everyone’s body is different, but most people start noticing subtle changes within the first couple of weeks. For me, the real transformation kicked in around week three. Consistency is key—stick with it, and you’ll see results.

**2. Is Liv Pure safe?**  
Absolutely. The formula is made from natural ingredients that have been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. Plus, it’s free from harmful chemicals, fillers, or artificial additives. Of course, if you have specific health concerns or are on medication, it’s always a good idea to consult your doctor first.

**3. Will it work if I don’t change my diet or exercise routine?**  
Yes, it works regardless of your current lifestyle. That said, I found that adding in a few healthier choices—like eating more whole foods and moving a bit more—amplified the results. Liv Pure isn’t about drastic changes; it’s about creating sustainable progress.

# [👉Click here to visit Liv Pure's Official website](https://tinyurl.com/2krak99n)

**4. Are there any side effects?**  
I didn’t experience any side effects, and most people report the same. Since the ingredients are natural and designed to support your body, it’s unlikely you’ll encounter negative reactions. However, if you have allergies or sensitivities, check the ingredient list to ensure it’s a good fit for you.

**5. Do I need to take it forever?**  
Not at all. Liv Pure is about restoring balance, not dependency. Once your liver is functioning optimally and your body is back on track, you can scale back. Some people use it seasonally as a gentle detox or whenever they feel their body needs a reset.

**6. Is it worth the investment?**  
If you’re serious about improving your health, absolutely. I’ve spent money on countless products that promised the moon but delivered nothing. Liv Pure was different—it worked. For me, the value far outweighed the cost because it gave me results I could see, feel, and sustain.

**7. What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
That’s the beauty of it—there’s no risk. Liv Pure comes with a satisfaction guarantee, so if it doesn’t work for you, you can get your money back. It’s as simple as that.

As someone who tries out different coffee makers more often than I'd like to admit, I was curious to see if the K-Supreme lived up to the hype.



Right off the bat, the sleek design caught my eye. Seriously, this thing's a looker. My kitchen doesn't look half bad with it on the counter. Set up was super easy, basically plug in and go. The reservoir's got a 66oz capacity and is dual-position removable, which is nice, but I still find myself forgetting to refill it sometimes. Minor inconvenience though.

Find out the cost with a [quick click.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/brewing-excellence-keurig-k-supreme-review-b0892v8jt8/)

The first cup I brewed had me raising an eyebrow in a good way. Keurig's MultiStream technology actually does a solid job of hitting the coffee grounds evenly, giving a flavorful cup every time. I appreciate the four brew size options too, from 6 to 12 ounces. It's versatile enough for my caffeine needs, whether I'm dashing out the door or sipping leisurely on a Sunday morning.



The fam's been into it too. My partner's finally stopped giving me side-eye about the number of coffee gadgets I own because they genuinely like this one. Even my teen niece, who’s staying with us and is weirdly into iced coffee, uses it often. She just brews directly over ice, and it works. Honestly, it's borderline miraculous to have something we all agree on.



When I compare it to other machines like the Nespresso or Breville, Keurig comes out on top in some areas, like its larger water tank and straightforward use. It does trail behind on the noise front, though. This thing isn't shy. If you're the kind of person who enjoys morning silence, maybe not the best fit.



Price-wise, it's not the cheapest, but you're getting decent bang for your buck considering its features. I like that it doesn’t suck up much energy, which is a nice nod to both eco-friendliness and my utility bills.



The K-Supreme isn't perfect, though. It's bigger than some other machines out there, so it does hog a bit more counter space. And if you're environmentally conscious, you might not dig the whole K-Cup pod deal. Fingerprints and smudges show up on the gray finish too, which is a total bummer for someone who hates cleaning as much as I do. And no frother, so if you're into lattes, you'll need a separate gadget.



Overall, the Keurig K-Supreme Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker’s been a nice addition to my kitchen. Not flawless, but it gets the job done well enough that I’m gonna keep it around.



Some quick pros:

\- MultiStream Tech gives good flavor

\- Different sizes for your mood

\- Big water tank = less refilling

\- Saves on energy



Cons worth mentioning:

\- Noise could be a dealbreaker for some

\- Takes up more space

\- Pods aren't the greenest option

\- Needs regular cleaning to avoid looking grubby

\- No built-in frother



Tried a couple variations, but I'm sticking with this one for the home. It just fits my day-to-day life. If you're in the market for something reliable, this could be worth checking out.",1,1734331895.0,TastefulCoffee,0,1.0,False

1hfdc8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hfdc8e/lessons_from_a_chronic_quitter_reflections_on_10/,Lessons from a Chronic Quitter: Reflections on 10+ Attempts at Going Caffeine-Free,"I’ve tried quitting caffeine cold turkey at least 10 times now, each attempt lasting anywhere from 2 to 6 months. Recently, I hit the 21-day mark again and I’m determined to make this truly my last time. I’m writing this as a reminder for my future self—a sort of record of what these withdrawal periods were really like—so that the next time I’m tempted by something as small as a “harmless” soda, I can come back here and remember exactly why I’m doing this.



When withdrawal symptoms were at their worst, browsing this subreddit (/r/decaf) often helped. It reminded me I wasn’t alone. I’ve successfully quit other addictions in the past—alcohol, with the help of the book Alcohol Explained (recommended over at r/stopdrinking), and cigarettes using Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Reddit’s been instrumental in helping me break free from multiple dependencies. Caffeine is no different, except it’s woven so deeply into daily life that avoiding it can feel like dodging landmines everywhere you go.



For example, I traveled to Thailand recently. Unlike my home in Korea, not many cafes there offered decaf options. Even convenience stores were saturated with caffeinated drinks. Thai tea, soda, and other beverages—even those that seem harmless—are often loaded with caffeine. Because I wasn’t drinking coffee in the morning anymore, I would find myself justifying a coke at lunch, or grabbing whatever drink was available while working at a cafe. Before I knew it, I was back in full-blown caffeine addiction mode after just three weeks abroad. Now, I’ve spent another three weeks battling withdrawal again.



From my experience, the hardest part of quitting is the first week—headaches, lethargy, feeling generally unwell. After that, the symptoms become intermittent, less intense but still frustrating. I’ve always quit cold turkey. When headaches became unbearable, I relied on ibuprofen or similar painkillers to push through.



What makes quitting caffeine tricky is how easily you can slip back. After living completely caffeine-free for a long period, a single 500ml bottle of cola can wreck a night’s sleep. Then you’re dealing with sleep deprivation, which triggers stress, which leads to cravings for quick dopamine hits—often sugary or caffeinated drinks. Maybe you’ll justify a decaf coffee in the morning, and after a few days of that, you’re back in a cafe that doesn’t offer decaf and you think, “One caffeinated drink won’t kill me.” Before long, the vicious cycle is back in full swing.



My withdrawal symptoms have been pretty consistent:

1.  Insomnia  
2. Heightened sensitivity to stress and irritability  
3. Frequent mouth ulcers in the first week (I’m not sure if others experience this too)  
4. Intense headaches that make me want to do nothing all day  
5. A pervasive sense of mental fog



I’m writing this now because I don’t want to fall back into caffeine’s grip yet again. If you’re sensitive to insomnia, anxiety, or just feel mentally off with caffeine, it’s not enough to avoid coffee—you need to watch out for all forms of caffeine. Tea, green tea, soda, energy drinks, chocolate—they can all keep you stuck in a loop of poor sleep and heightened stress.



I also want to share a bit of encouragement for anyone currently going through those brutal early days. On days 1–5, I was in so much pain that I honestly felt like throwing away important business deals just to escape the discomfort. I relied on supportive posts here and occasionally took painkillers to keep functioning. Now at day 21, while my life isn’t suddenly perfect, the symptoms that were at 100% intensity have dropped to less than 10%. The headaches, the irritability, the mental fog—all significantly reduced. If you’re struggling right now, know that your future self will be grateful for the effort you’re putting in today. Hold on a little longer, push through these difficult moments, and remember: you’re not alone. It does get better. Stay strong, and stay decaf.

1hfd824,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/1hfd824/christmases_past/,Christmases Past,"Christmas time approaching, so time to roll out an old Christmas story once again.  

Gramp and Gram had two lovely large evergreen trees spaced equally in the front yard of their house.  Gramp had planted them as saplings after he’d completed building Gram her house many years ago.  Along with a climbing wild rose bush in a small fenced enclosure equidistant between the two.  

As the house had aged, both the trees had grown quite tall and stately, and the rose bush had thrived year after year. 

A now long past Christmas had approached one year, and Gramp had instructed one of his sons (my Uncle Bob) to go into the surrounding hillsides and find a suitable tree and bring it home. 

Bob said he didn’t care to - it was cold outside, and would be getting dark soon.  Gramp heard him out, then advised “Do it anyway.”

Bob came dragging a nice 6 or 7 footer into the house presently.  Gramp allowed that it would do, and expressed surprise that Bob had found one so quickly.  Bob replied that it had been quite close by.  

Gramp discovered just How close by the next morning when he stepped outside with a cup of coffee and happened to glance up.  Then went looking for Bob.  

One tree was now shorter than the other by 6 or 7 feet, lol.  

The last time I was Back Home, I visited the old home place that held so many good memories.  Gram and Gramp were long gone by then.  Fire had taken the empty house; nothing but foundation stones and the fieldstone walls of the old cellar left.  The barn was long gone, too.  

But the two trees were still there.  They’d been singed, but had recovered.  One still shorter than the other.  That made me smile.  

Bob was long gone by then, too.  As in the song “Reuben James”, one day they’d carried him in from the field he was working for Gramp.  Where he had collapsed.  His heart had finally failed his massive frame. 

Bob was what we called “a big’un.”  He towered over Gramp, who was no small man himself.  

Momma was in awe of him the first time she met him.  She hadn’t seen a man quite that tall and large before.  

He in turn was delighted by her.  He hadn’t seen a grown woman quite that small before - would smile down at her in passing and pat her on the top of her head. 

His heart, of course.  He lingered for a short time afterward, but there was really little to be done.  I drove Mother to see him in the hospital one last time.  He said that he was ready, had had a good life, and had no regrets.  Time to meet his Maker.  

It pained me to see brought down the giant who’d delighted in catching me and giving me rough knuckle rubs when I was a small boy.  

And the Family had never let him forget about the time he’d topped one of Gramp’s prize trees to celebrate the Christmas season, lol. 

That had been the second home Gramp had built for gram with his own hands.  The first, when they were newly married, would have been 1915, was in a pleasant small valley with a clear stream running through it higher up in the hills.  

A simple log cabin, traces of which still remained when I was a boy, though all signs of it are gone now - long since turned to dust.  But it’s still a pleasant spot.  Wildflowers grow there, and the steam still runs clear.  

There may or may not be an old well not far from it that may or may not contain whatever now remains of a man who’d done what no man should ever do.  Forgotten for a long time now, as if he’d never been.  As he deserved to be.  People disappeared sometimes.  

 But that Christmas had been a good one, once Gramp had calmed down, lol.  And there were many more like it afterward, one blending into another.  

I remember the first time Z and I were given the task of going into the woods and finding 
a tree of our own.  Under Gramp’s watchful eye, of course.  In any event, the other tree remained unmolested.  There was snow on the ground, it was cold and would soon be dark, and the three of us had a great time.  ",3,1734331067.0,FuckeryUniveristy,0,1.0,False

1hfd0mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1hfd0mj/plagiarism_part_two/,Plagiarism - Part two,"A little over a week ago I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1h9lfjr/plagiarism/) about being accused of plagiarism from a dude on a local facebook group.   
We went back and forth until I suggested to meet up for coffee and discuss the matter like civilized people.   
So we did, and had a very pleasant afternoon.   
  
The first thing he did was to apologize. He had a bad day and it got the best of him.   
  
Second, I found out that the image of his I posted in comparison to my own was not the image in question.   
He showed me the proper one, which he had posted in the comment section on my facebook post, where it was deleted by the group admin.   
Although it did not make his initial claim correct, we probably did shoot the image from the same angle and vantage point.   
We did talk a little about the situation, but soon moved on to talk about photography in general, shared stories, tips and locations.   
We talked for two hours before I had to leave. But we both enjoyed the conversation, and will probably meet up in the future. 

So in conclusion, it was all worth it. :)",35,1734330187.0,photography,6,0.95,False
