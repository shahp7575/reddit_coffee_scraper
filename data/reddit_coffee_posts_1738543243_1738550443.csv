1iget8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1iget8l/boomer_dining/,Boomer Dining,"I really dislike going to restaurants with my parents. They are the typical, entitled boomers who believe the world needs to cater to their whims. Going to restaurants with them involves them getting a manager nearly every time we go out and yelling out complaining. Today was no exception but fortunately, I was able to undo the damage my dad tried to inflict on a poor waitress today. 

We were meeting my dad for brunch before flying home at a very busy spot. He decided when he got there he wasn't going to eat so after we all ordered, he ordered a decaf coffee and boarding else. This was fine. 

The kitchen was clearly overwhelmed by the rush though and his coffee wasn't coming out quickly. The waitress came out and apologized, letting him know that there was no decaf made so they needed to brew it. After 15 minutes, still no coffee and he was getting antsy. The waitress came by again, apologized, and let him know it was coming. 

After she left my dad started complaining to me that she was screwing with him and went off to the kitchen. I figured he was just trying to get it himself. When he came back after another 5 or do minutes, he smugly let me know that he'd have his coffee and the manager was going to handle the waitress. 

I was like...what? Handle the waitress? According to my dad, she had been purposefully denying him coffee and was rudely blowing him off. He didn't tell the manager she had forgotten the coffee, he said she'd been doing it on purpose. 

Meanwhile the waitress had come over to profusely apologize (she had no idea yet that he'd talked to the manager) and started talking to my wife. From our conversation later she apparently was on the verge of tears because she was new and she thought one of the other waitresses was messing with her. (I actually think that was happening... someone else had taken our order and she came back and double checked the tickets with us.  They were all wrong)

I left to ""use the restroom"" and found the manager and asked if my dad complained about our waitress, which he confirmed. I told him that my dad is really hard to take to restaurants and always complains about the service. I let him know she'd been great and nothing he said was true. The guy's entire demeanor changed as I talked to him. He thanked me and said if I hadn't said that to him, she would have been reprimanded.

I have made what I think are improvements over time in terms of scripting, editing, on camera presentation, however minimal.

and while 100 subs isn't going to buy me a porsche, let alone a cup of coffee, it DOES feel nice that 100 folks have considered my content worthy of subscribing.

statistically, I'm downright absymal. I've been at it over 2 years in earnest. 200+ videos, most can't even break triple digit viewership.  For those who want to become rich and famous, treat me as a cautionary tale of stubborness and DON'T do what I am doing.

I started my channel on a lark during the pandemic.

My kid was going abroad to study, and one of her classes required video editing. In a past life I was tangentially involved with the subject so I offered assistance. But after her course was over, I had a software suite that wasn't being used, and was wondering if I could use it toward something. the criteria being:  
1. should be something I find interesting, hopefully others too  
2. have plenty of subject matter readily available for relatively low cost  
3. low startup and no running costs or time per video(supplies, scripting, editing)  
4. while geographically limited, evergreen-ish material not swayed by seasonality or time  
5. something I could easily do during the pandemic within the confines of my home.

and the channel was born.  
I'm not going to win academy awards for anything, my scripting, lighting, and Kevin Smith level of camera work are nothing to write home about.  
The only additional purchases I made specifically for the channel were a camera mount and a wind screen. the rest I cobbled together from around the house.

I don't know if others exist within the same niche; I create in a vacuum as I think ""comparison is the thief of joy"".  I purposefully haven't searched for others covering the same category so I don't know if they exist, and if I am similar to someone else, it truely is coincidence.  I also don't know if they are copying me, but seeing my numbers, I doubt I'm a viable target.

But making videos remains fun, and that's really all that matters to me.  
At least til I get fired and can't pay my mortgage...

1igepx7,https://brewlog.coffee/,Digital Coffee Journal,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been working on a project called BrewLog‚Äîa simple, digital coffee journal designed to help coffee enthusiasts track their tastings, take notes, and log brewing methods.

As a coffee nerd myself, I‚Äôve always found it tricky to keep consistent notes on what worked (and what didn‚Äôt) with different beans, grind sizes, and brew methods. I‚Äôve been using a physical coffee journal (just a regular notebook), but it quickly got messy and hard to organize. So, I started looking around for a digital coffee journal that could solve this problem. To my surprise, I could only find one or two options‚Äîand they were really outdated, lacking the features I wanted.

That‚Äôs when I decided to build BrewLog.

What BrewLog Does:
	‚Ä¢	Track your brews: Log details like origin, roast, grind size, brew time, and tasting notes.
	‚Ä¢	Discover patterns: See what techniques lead to your favorite cups.
	‚Ä¢	Perfect your process: Learn from your own data to improve over time.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee Map: Visualize where you‚Äôve had coffee from around the world.
	‚Ä¢	Community Recommendations: See other users‚Äô tasting notes to discover new coffees to try.

I‚Äôm currently preparing for launch, and I‚Äôll be sending out emails soon to invite a small group of people for early access. If you‚Äôre interested in testing it out and giving me feedback, sign up here:
üëâ https://brewlog.coffee/

I‚Äôd love your input:
	‚Ä¢	Would you find this useful?
	‚Ä¢	What features would you like to 
see? 
	‚Ä¢	Any design ideas you would like?

I‚Äôm genuinely looking to make this a good tool that people can use whenever they do tastings. Or to know whether this is just a bad idea. So any input (or brutal honesty) is appreciated. Thanks for reading!",2,1738549971.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I was the only person cooking in the house. I use to purchase this specific brand of seasoning as a collective item because I really liked the bottle and they became extremely rare to find in stores and then non-existent. So I refilled the bottles with other brands of seasonings. I took the collectables with me (most of the bottles were empty) and I left the other seasonings. I didn‚Äôt touch anything in the fridge because now he‚Äôd have to cook for himself. He also refused my offer to organize and clean the kitchen before I left, stating that he‚Äôd clean it himself. 

He‚Äôs now mad at me that I ‚Äútook all of the seasoning‚Äù. Mind you, the collectibles I had were stylishly lined off on the stovetop so it was a noticeable difference, but I told him the other seasonings (which was practically every seasoning I used to cook with, were in the cupboard). 

Two months after I moved out he was due to travel and asked me to look after his dogs and I agreed even though it was completely last minute and a lack of preparation on his end. Told me I can take anything from the fridge I wanted that was on the verge of going bad‚Ä¶highlighting the produce drawers that were untouched from the day I moved out. I knew they were most likely rotten and I refused to search through it because I would feel compelled to clean it and that was no longer my responsibility. I use to clean the fridge every week to make space for new groceries and I cooked everyday so there was a high turnover rate and the fridge was well maintained. Now there‚Äôs a bunch of rotten stuff and dead bugs so I‚Äôm not messing with that.

I took a creamer I really liked and a half consumed bag of flavored ground coffee I bought before I moved out that I initially decided to leave there but I took with me to try a cup since it was a unique flavor. I left all the instant coffee and cappuccino mix. He‚Äôs now angry that I took ‚Äúall of the coffee‚Äù and the creamer when he basically told me to help myself.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We split chores in the house evenly, but since living here, I've noticed a problem with personal dishes.

It's typically a small issue, like the counter is overcrowded or all 12 of our spoons are on vacation (this is our polite way of saying that people need to bring dishes down from their room). 

My issue this time, though, has to do with our dishes bin: in the kitchen, everyone has a designated spot to put their dishes if they need to do them later. It's helped declutter the counters a bit, although most of the large pots and pans are still left dirty on the stove and countertops for days at a time. The problem with the dishes bin is that once the mess is out of sight, it's out of mind. 

Most of the time, people clean their dishes within two weeks. Occasionally something will go bad or they can't fit anymore dishes there and it's a reminder for them to clean up. However, on to the issue at hand, one of my housemates has had dishes sitting in their bin for almost a month. 

The most notable object is a large mason jar with coffee in it that has dried significantly and produced a large amount of mold. Their dishes are also spilling out on top of the counter, as they have no more room in their bin. I don't like having something so unhealthy growing in our food space, and their extra dishes are taking up space others use for cooking.

Normally, I would be fine with asking them to clean up. However, about three weeks ago, they told our house about a loss they experienced. I don't want to go into details for their privacy, but it had put a strain on them and they asked for some grace on their dishes. 

Everyone agreed and consoled them, and I did as well. However, it's been three weeks now and the bioterror is still growing. 

Other info: 
- I'm a working student, so I barely have time for my own life and dishes, so doing their dishes for them is out of the question. 
- We don't have a dishwasher. Our house is 100 years old and there literally isn't space.
- While we do have meetings for our house on a regular basis, I would likely bring this up with them privately, in person.

I really like the laid-back, boho vibe, and I‚Äôm aiming for a setup that maximizes comfort while keeping things minimal but warm.

What I‚Äôve Got So Far:

Floor seating setup with pillows and a rug

A solid amount of natural light from two south facing windows (I live in NYC)

Some plants! (including a money tree that‚Äôs doing well)

A guitar & amp setup near the corner


What I‚Äôm Looking For:

1. More plants ‚Äì What should I add? Thinking of some trailing plants or a corner plant stand.


2. Window bar utilization ‚Äì The bars open outward, so I was thinking of hanging planters or maybe a small herb garden?


3. General cozy vibes ‚Äì Would a low coffee table, lanterns, or extra seating (like poufs) make sense?


4. Storage without killing the vibe ‚Äì I like the open feel, but I still need spots to store books or random things.

If you want to approach me,  just do it. You said you didn't want anything with me, so i left and i will not approach you. Don't come in with your bullshit insecurities. All I've ever wanted was to be able to be sweet and loving and supportive. I've never wanted anyone else since the day we met. I don't want to have to keep proving myself. I just want to be in love and be loved. You can start by telling me you need me in your life. You need me next to you to heal. Tell me you want to make things right. Tell me you long for my warmth and my energy. Tell me you finally see what I have been trying to offer. Tell me you're ready to leap. To grow. To fly. Tell me you want to be my fella. That you're ready to grow old with me and make people sick with how in love we are. Tell me you want to be my calm be my support and you're ready to accept mine. Tell me you can't get enough of our crazy adventures and you need it in your life. That you want me in every memory you make from now on.  You're ready to romanticize our life. Yes our life. Ready to have Sundays mornings with crazy kids and breakfast and coffee and ukulele sarinades. Ready for all of the little things and all the big things.  Ready to explore all of my depths and let me into yours.  Tell me I'm the only one you want to spend your life learning. That you're done running, no matter what the discomfort is. 
If that's not what you're putting on the table... it just isn't what I want. I will never choose you over my peace and I want to be that in your life.  A peaceful place. When the world is burning chaos,  I want us to both know we are the calm in the middle of whatever the storm is.  I will never be hidden again. I'll never be made small. Either take me as I am and I do the same. We strive to love one another through our differences. Honor those differences. Respect those differences. But love so fucking hard it cracks the earth wide open.

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town with a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city as she would ride her bike through towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling free from the world around her feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. Racing with excitement with her smile saying it all as she rode through the town passing by people as some would wave as she passed by

With the feeling of nothing could stop this girl from Trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety. Grace was just your typical young green eyed girl who liked her shredded jeans tee shirt and hoodie living her life her way. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets. She would often ride her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape she even had a name for her bike she would often call it Quicksilver. 

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go forever dodging in and out of front of cars. As always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life. More then often finding herself thinking about her life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else‚Äôs life other then her own. 

But for now it was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked often finding herself dreaming of life on her own on her bike.

Often finding herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride  a trial that she was at the moment making her way through it  gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

The locals would refer to it as Angels Ravine For to anyone standing there could lookout over into the valley ahead.It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself. It was a quit place it was her place where she would come to often. To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up she didn‚Äôt have any family or many friends. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself  with Grace finding that herLife was there in the mountains with her bike outside of her hometown. But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky for she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought. But she also had a light that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of her thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else‚Äôs.That night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

‚Äúif I am not me then who am I ‚Äú

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself while also thinking to herself who else would she tell. For oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her in her Life with no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

The always the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams came they went as Grace found herself

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door holding her bike knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets her usual weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Grace that was her Life on her bike loose and fast racing with the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it‚Äôs many mountain trails telling passerby‚Äôs of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like it was her own little Heaven but this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster then normally having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn‚Äôt wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. But this time was different this day she was just enjoying a nice quiet ride in the mountains. 

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with a few words but just looking out into it, It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would they be liked for as far back as Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she woke up being in a place with people around her. But not as family just people in her life a life that seemingly has went by all too fast with the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light then disappeared behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. The same dream as well as the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be another demission from what seemed to be another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her but everything around her was different, different in the way she lived From the town that she lived in. But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said in the dream a name that was name of the girl in her dreams someone in the dream called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning light putting her hands up to her head. Grace just set there stunned thinking to herself on how real that dream was for unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there I was her. Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Grace began to scream a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 ‚Äú hello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you‚Äù 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

‚Äú then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?‚Äù ‚Äú 

I know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek‚Äù 

With Grace then replying ‚Äú answers to what? What answers do I seek‚Äù 

‚Äú Dreams, Grace your dreams.‚Äù 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

‚Äú it is you Grace and it is not.‚Äù 

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

‚Äú me! How‚Äù 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

‚Äú In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life. 
But now in this Life you are her and she is not and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life‚Äù 

with Grace then replying 

‚Äú is this Heaven then and are you a Angel?‚Äù 

With a smile the man just simply said 

‚Äú I am who I am someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for‚Äù 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 ‚Äú the dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.‚Äù 

For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have now go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you‚Äù 

Just as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn‚Äôt help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come a Life of whatever was to come for Grace.

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been working on a project called BrewLog‚Äîa simple, digital coffee journal designed to help coffee enthusiasts track their tastings, take notes, and log brewing methods.

As a coffee nerd myself, I‚Äôve always found it tricky to keep consistent notes on what worked (and what didn‚Äôt) with different beans, grind sizes, and brew methods. I‚Äôve been using a physical coffee journal (just a regular notebook), but it quickly got messy and hard to organize. So, I started looking around for a digital coffee journal that could solve this problem. To my surprise, I could only find one or two options‚Äîand they were really outdated, lacking the features I wanted.

That‚Äôs when I decided to build BrewLog.

What BrewLog Does:
	‚Ä¢	Track your brews: Log details like origin, roast, grind size, brew time, and tasting notes.
	‚Ä¢	Discover patterns: See what techniques lead to your favorite cups.
	‚Ä¢	Perfect your process: Learn from your own data to improve over time.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee Map: Visualize where you‚Äôve had coffee from around the world.
	‚Ä¢	Community Recommendations: See other users‚Äô tasting notes to discover new coffees to try.

Do I mend things or move on?,"TLDR: I was the only person there for a friend after a mental health episode, and we became really good friends. Now, she's developing a pattern of what I feel is putting me on the backburner and taking our plans to do them with other people while leaving me behind

I (25F) am having issues with a friend (21F) I got close to about a year ago. Let‚Äôs call her Brandy. We go to the same college, and I met her through a close friend who used to live with me. Last February, Brandy had a bad mental health episode which resulted in a major fallout with the people she used to live with. Let's just say those folks don't know how to handle someone in crisis. She told me the whole story one night when she texted me in desperate need of a friend to talk to, since her roommates were formerly her closest friends. Brandy also said that because of the fallout, she was too anxious to make food or use the bathroom in her apartment because her roommates were giving her the silent treatment. She lived in my housing complex, so I offered to let her come over whenever and started inviting her over after class.

After a couple weeks of her situation still not improving, I offered to let her move in with me. I lived by myself in a five-bedroom house, and we both had leases under the same property manager, so it was honestly perfect. We met with the manager, and we got the lease transferred no problem. I helped Brandy and her family move her into my place that weekend. She got a lot better because she was fully out of her old situation, and she ended up withdrawing from classes for the semester for her mental health and enrolled in an intensive outpatient therapy program to focus on herself. A couple months later, Brandy reconnected with an old friend at our school she knew from a while back. We‚Äôll call the friend Lisa (23F). I was really happy for her because she wanted to make new friends after losing all her other ones. She thought me and Lisa would get along because we‚Äôre all similar, and we did, so I started tagging along to go hang out. Brandy and I became part of Lisa‚Äôs group, Brandy more so than me, obviously, and it was a lot of fun.

Brandy‚Äôs 21^(st) birthday fell during finals week, and I had a lot on my plate because I‚Äôm a physics major and my classes are demanding. That was also around when the movie Challengers came out, and we had loose plans to go see it Tuesday that week because the theater had a ticket discount. I found out my biggest final was on Wednesday, so I had to pass on the movie to study. Brandy understood school comes first, and we rescheduled for the following Tuesday once classes were over. A couple days later, she came back from Lisa‚Äôs house and asked me about the Challengers plans again. She told Lisa how we wanted to go see it, but I couldn‚Äôt because of my exam, and they came up with an alternative plan. The new plan was that Brandy, Lisa, and a group of others would go on Tuesday night of finals like we had originally planned, and Brandy promised she would go again with just me the following Tuesday so I didn‚Äôt feel left out. I did feel left out because I wanted to see the movie and I felt like I was the only one not going, but I tried not to let it bother me because it was her birthday and we would go together later, so I told her that was fine with me. Brandy and her friends went, but she never brought up the plans for us to go afterwards. I waited to see if she would, and the following Tuesday came and went without us going like she promised. It really hurt my feelings because it felt like she totally forgot about me and our original plans, and I did end up getting left out and left behind, anyways. I didn‚Äôt bring it up to her because I was leaving for a summer research program in Michigan a couple weeks later, and I didn‚Äôt want to cause any issues before I left.

For the ten weeks I was gone, I only got a handful of texts from Brandy, and she only called me once. I stayed in touch regularly with all my other close friends, and they were all eager to call me and check in periodically. But not Brandy. I even texted her after not hearing back for a few weeks, and she told me she had been stressed about financial stuff because she was in the process of leaving her job and looking for another. Other than that, it was sparse and one-sided. Meanwhile, I could see on her socials she was hanging out with Lisa and her other friends all the time, and she seemed to settle into a new group. Again, I was happy she had new friends, but I couldn‚Äôt help but feel left out because I wasn‚Äôt hearing from her, and she was living in my house and taking care of my belongings. It was just odd. It‚Äôs worth adding that I wanted to bring stuff from the dispensaries in Michigan home for myself and some friends because cannabis is legal and so cheap there, and Brandy had no problems keeping in touch with me regarding what she wanted from the dispensary, which also made me raise an eyebrow, but I figured I would talk to her about what was going on once I got home.

Before I left, Brandy agreed to water my plants for the summer since she was still going to live in the house until her new apartment was ready in July. I gave her a very extensive care sheet and told her to let me know if anything happens to any of them. I have over two dozen plants I care a lot for, so I wanted to know if anything went wrong so I could troubleshoot or anticipate that one wouldn‚Äôt make it when I came back.A couple days before I came home, Brandy texted me to let me know although she did her best, apparently a few of my plants died over the summer and she replaced them because she felt bad, and I would need to do major rehab on the rest when I got back. When I got home, half of my plants were in bad shape, and the replacements were sitting beside the dead ones on my coffee table. I almost cried when I saw the state of them because I explicitly told her AND put on the care sheet to tell me if anything was wrong to avoid this exact situation, and she knew how much I care about them. I seriously needed to have a conversation with her, but I wanted to take my time and ease into things because I can be emotional and confrontational. I also had plans to visit other friends out of town the following week, and, on top of not wanting to start problems and leave, I wanted to get my other friends‚Äô input because one of them is the mutual friend Brandy and I have in common.

A week and a half later, Lisa messaged me. Back in May, I made plans to go to a Cage the Elephant concert with my same out-of-town besties for my birthday at the end of August. We‚Äôve loved the band for years, and we just wanted to get cheap lawn tickets and go get drunk and have fun. I invited Brandy to come with us so she could spend time with our mutual friend and meet my other super close friend. Anyways, Lisa messaged me saying Brandy told her we were going to the show, and she had gotten a ticket, too, because some of her other friends would be there, so she was just going to ride with us to the show. I was pissed because it was a week before the show, those were MY plans, and I was the one driving. So, basically, Lisa was letting me know she and Brandy decided she was joining my plans and invited herself into my car because she needed a ride. Then, Brandy texted me asking what section we would be in for the show, and didn‚Äôt mention Lisa at all. I told her about Lisa‚Äôs message but, while it was cool she wanted to come, I didn‚Äôt invite her. I didn‚Äôt want her there, I didn‚Äôt want to hangout with her friends I didn‚Äôt know, and it bothered me that they took over my plans behind my back for my own birthday thing. And I was still upset because I hadn‚Äôt spoken to Brandy yet about why she barely talked to me all summer, so this felt like a continuation of the same dynamic. She insisted she wasn‚Äôt inviting anyone else to my plans and got defensive, and I had to step away completely from the conversation because it made me too emotionally volatile.

My birthday was a few days after that, and Brandy texted me happy birthday like nothing happened. I didn‚Äôt respond because it pissed me off about the whole thing all over again. A couple days later, I texted her and said because things were still really awkward due to the unresolved tension, I didn‚Äôt want to go to the show with her anymore. I had the plans for months, my friends were driving a few hours to come, and it was for my birthday, so I didn‚Äôt want anything to put a damper on the vibes. I transferred her ticket to her and said we would talk about the situation once the show was over.

Brandy and I had our conversation, and, apparently, everything with the concert was from a misconception Lisa had. That stupid bitch didn‚Äôt listen to Brandy when she told her she wasn‚Äôt sure of my plans and to ask me first. She even showed me the messages with Lisa because I didn‚Äôt believe her at first, and it really was all Lisa‚Äôs fault for assuming otherwise. So, I forgave her once we talked it out and I heard her side. I no longer talk to Lisa because she refused to take any sort of responsibility for the issue and caused more problems, so the three of us don‚Äôt hang out together anymore, but they‚Äôre still best friends. I brought up the communication issue from the summer, and Brandy apologized for going radio silent on me, saying she has issues with initiating calls and external communication with her friends and has only ever initiated two facetime calls in her whole life. Even though I thought that was barely an excuse and really immature, I decided to look past it and give her another chance because of her issues with friends in the past. I also wanted to get past it because I didn‚Äôt want to lose her as a friend, and we worked it out. Brandy told me she really missed spending time with me and wanted to have time together once a week for us to hangout and do homework together now that fall classes had started. I told her the ball was in her court, and she would just have to text me and ask.

We did our best because of our busy schedules, but things have never gone back to how they were before. Brandy spends most of her free time with her group of other friends, and she also started dating a new guy she met through that group. I‚Äôm the only friend who hasn‚Äôt met her new boyfriend, despite telling her I really wanted to. We haven‚Äôt gone out together since before the summer, but she goes out frequently with her new friends.

The most recent thing that has me questioning our friendship was another incident of what I felt was Brandy being inconsiderate with plans. Like I mentioned earlier, I did summer research in Michigan, and cannabis is legal and super cheap there. When I told her about how it works, I said it would make a great road trip to go sometime. It‚Äôs about a 5 and a half hour drive from where we live, and I suggested an overnight trip in the future to go stock up and visit the city I was in. A few weeks ago, I asked Brandy if she was free to hang out. She told me she made plans with a coworker to make a road trip to Michigan the next day to stock up and asked if I wanted to tag along last minute or have her get anything for me. That really put me off after everything we‚Äôve already had issues with because I feel like it‚Äôs now becoming a pattern where I get put on the backburner and she does the plans for stuff I wanted to do without me, and I don‚Äôt think she realizes it. I‚Äôve invested a lot into my friendship with Brandy, and I was literally the only person there for her at one point when she needed someone. I can‚Äôt help but feel like I became a temporary springboard for her when she needed help, but now she‚Äôs got all these other people, she doesn‚Äôt need or value me as much anymore. I told her I‚Äôd pass on the trip because it bummed me out she was doing our Michigan plans without me, and she, once again, said she wasn‚Äôt trying to steal our original plans and tried smoothing it over by saying the trip might not even happen. I explained why it hurt my feelings and I told her I felt like it was becoming a pattern, considering the movie incident and the concert incident, and I didn‚Äôt like it.

She didn‚Äôt answer me for a week, so I followed up and asked her what the deal was because I already said I wasn‚Äôt feeling prioritized as a friend, and that how she was handling the situation didn‚Äôt prove otherwise, and if she needed time to process, all she had to do was tell me. She responded, telling me it was around the anniversary of the incident from last year and she was taking care of herself, and that she needs time because she isn‚Äôt ready to address this. I understood completely because she went through a lot, and it made me feel like a bit of a jerk for getting on her case, but I wish she could‚Äôve said that instead of leaving me on such a cliffhanger. That was last week, and I‚Äôve still heard nothing from her.

I‚Äôm not sure if I want to continue being friends with Brandy. I graduate in a few months, and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll have the same communication issues with her even if we work through this. I‚Äôve also been through something similar with someone else before, where I stuck around in a one-sided friendship longer than I should have because I was really invested, and I don‚Äôt want to make the same mistake again. I understand not every similar situation is bound to end the same way, but I‚Äôm trying not to repeat history. I do love Brandy a lot, and we‚Äôve been through a lot and have a deep connection I would hate to throw away. It‚Äôs just disappointing to see myself get put on the backburner because I really went out of my way for her and was there as her only friend when she needed one, and now a year later her life is centered around different friends that don‚Äôt include me. I‚Äôm just not sure if it‚Äôs feasible and I need advice.",1,1738548580.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1ige92m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/1ige92m/canadas_tariff_retaliation_a_necessary_defense_or/,Canada's Tariff Retaliation: A Necessary Defense or Economic Risk?,"With the recent announcement of Canada imposing **$155 billion in tariffs** on U.S. goods in response to unjustified U.S. tariffs, opinions are flying left and right. The government claims this move is to protect Canadian interests, consumers, workers, and businesses. But is this the right approach?

To break it down, the first phase targets $30 billion worth of goods, including items like orange juice, peanut butter, wine, spirits, beer, coffee, appliances, apparel, footwear, motorcycles, cosmetics, and pulp and paper. An additional $125 billion worth of goods, including passenger vehicles, trucks, steel and aluminum products, certain fruits and vegetables, aerospace products, beef, pork, dairy, and recreational vehicles, will follow.

Some argue this is a strong stance to defend our economy. After all, the U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods have been widely criticized as unfair and damaging to our industries. By imposing these retaliatory tariffs, Canada is sending a clear message that we won't back down and will take measures to protect our own economic interests. This could potentially force the U.S. to reconsider its position and negotiate more favorable trade terms.

However, others worry about the potential retaliation from the U.S. and the impact on Canadian consumers and businesses. Tariffs generally lead to higher prices for goods, which can hurt consumers who have to pay more for everyday items. For businesses, especially those that rely on imported materials and products, the increased costs could strain their operations and reduce their competitiveness. There‚Äôs also the risk that prolonged trade tensions could lead to job losses in industries affected by tariffs.

The larger question is whether these tariffs will actually achieve the desired outcome. Can they effectively protect our economy without triggering a trade war that could have broader negative consequences? Historically, trade wars have shown that they often end up harming both parties involved, leading to economic slowdowns and strained relations.

Another aspect to consider is the political implications of these tariffs. The move is likely to be popular among certain segments of the population who feel that Canada needs to assert itself and stand up to unfair trade practices. However, it could also lead to backlash from those who believe that diplomacy and negotiation should be the primary tools for resolving trade disputes. The upcoming elections might also play a role in how this issue is perceived and debated.

Overall, this situation raises important questions about the balance between protecting national interests and maintaining healthy international trade relations. It's a complex issue with no easy answers, and the long-term effects remain to be seen. As we navigate these uncertain times, it's crucial to stay informed and engaged in discussions about our economic policies and their impact on our daily lives.

What are your thoughts on this move by the Canadian government? Do you think these tariffs will protect our economy, or could they backfire and hurt us more in the long run?",0,1738548519.0,ontario,7,0.28,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

My whole like feels like a mess right now. Politics, relationship problems, financial problems, work problems.. everything seems to be hitting me all at once lmao. Hoping that this is all a dream that i can wake up from in the morning.

I guess I'm just looking for a real person to talk to, god knows i can use that right now.

Do i consider myself depressed? No... not like when i was in my early 20s. Mentally more stable now. But still need something to lean into?

Maybe this is all a early life crisis lol...

I guess a little bit about me.

31 Vietnamese M born and raised in Canada. Currently own a small business and unfortunately lacking in the friendship department. Not that i dont have friends, but life gets in the way, people grow apart. 

I have 13 tattoos and enjoy cooking. One could say its my therapy when i can take my time just to try new recipes. 

Im the type that prefers a conversation over coffee rather than alcohol. Used to be a big stoner but quit when i beat cancer last year.

For the most part im easy going and chill.

I would prefer to talk to people who are motivated in life and career oriented. Also somebody closer to my age.

Im looking for a strictly platonic friendship as i am currently engaged, however theres a big part of me that just want to call it off. May actually happen sooner than later.

If you feel that we may click, send me a dm and we can go on from there. If we dont vibe with each other and ghost each other, no hard feelings.

If you're local, even better. With the trust that we built, i am open to hanging out.

If you made it this far, looking forward to hearing from you.

Ignore the minor border gore.](https://preview.redd.it/wk07xfjhttge1.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dcbe30e37b046e02bc5f807ab6b8d374a361c8f)

Disclaimer: This nation is almost as Broken as Broken Coast.

Anyways, Costa Cafeinada gets a 6/10. They are very much outdated, and I understand why many say Mexico desperately needs a rework. Like Beltran-Levya, the groundwork is there for a solid nation. However, they have interesting lore, unique mechanics, good balance, and impactful decisions. Unlike Beltran-Levya, you are not shoehorned down a certain path with a strict time limit. Their focuses are all 50 days long, which I did not mind too much, considering their focus tree is very small and humble, but it gets the job done:

[The entire Costa Cafeinada focus tree. Yeah. This is it.](https://preview.redd.it/tpz8ynstttge1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a939e8624bbd470dad51079ea1d5385fbef2fe)

I don't like the left branch about navy stuff, but other than that, this is designed pretty well. The only gripe I have is that most of the unique mechanics do not work as intended, making many of the focuses themselves pretty useless.

Here is an example of a unique mechanic that DOES work:

[Financial decisions](https://preview.redd.it/49rfqtr1utge1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b8268b6d965e5c7acf3df6183d5d1aff2c55d41)

You are tasked by your investors to build 2 civilian factories every 180 days. Fail and you receive a debuff that makes it harder to achieve your next goal. Pass and you achieve a minor buff. Granted that you will not pass every single one of these, this is actually a pretty cool mechanic, but I won't lie that being doomed to fail these eventually kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially when this mechanic continues on and on until the end of time.

Here's the main unique mechanic and one that is broken:

[\\""Missed Opportunity\\""](https://preview.redd.it/6vemc3obutge1.png?width=1422&format=png&auto=webp&s=341646272354fde1426b4afb292fc7a646daf3a5)

If I had a nickel for every time I attempted to sale coffee to someone and failed, I would have nine nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's odd that it happened nine times.

No, for real, all focuses that unlock customers are useless because no matter how hard I tried NOONE wants to buy coffee. Which means, you guessed it, Costa Cafeinada is ENTIRELY BROKEN. Unless, of course, there is a way which I am overlooking to easily get customers or I am just absurdly unlucky. However, it seems useless to even attempt to sell coffee because you just lose -15K caps every time you try, which sucks.

The other decisions though, like ""Offshore Investment,"" are not bad. 1 civilian factory for 135K caps, er, I mean dried cacao beans, is not a bad deal in my eyes, especially when Oaxaca has the potential to become an incredibly powerful trade node through focuses.

But all the focuses related to gaining new sales or customers effectively does nothing. So. That's nice.

[3730 coffee and noone to sell it to... So sad.](https://preview.redd.it/bv99aia3vtge1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=99975840451714477001b715055b8bbe3919cc57)

This also means there's not really a reason to produce coffee at all, which is unfortunate. However, you can produce a few of the unique blends and give them to your soldiers via unique commander abilities, which is a feature I absolutely adore!

[Did someone say coffee?](https://preview.redd.it/fnr7rajavtge1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8441a54a51eaccd54b67f6115792242d9426cc)

Oh, and by the way. This was a very fun national spirit to have:

[+80&#37; Stability, -40&#37; Recruitable Population!](https://preview.redd.it/u1ckhkwevtge1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe3546d7ba4b6cd8b43cf7134f004f9c8f2c5bf)

I should mention here that the normal decisions you can take for 50 PP to gradually increase stability aren't all available for Costa Cafeinada. A shame.

Anyway, uh, as for how the game went. I played loyal to the Atzlan, was eventually given freedom, and helped them out in The Flower Wars against the Itza. Taking full control of the Eastern front and pushing back Itza and Honduras was an incredibly fun war to fight. The military campaign was the highlight of this playthrough and is most certainly one of the reasons I feel they are a 6/10.

[We are reasonable](https://preview.redd.it/gw4yawhwvtge1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=c481b820a6a190a05717f3771c4347bf2cedc43f)

This nation has one more unique mechanic: The Roastery:

[The Roastery!](https://preview.redd.it/rp1lzrxzvtge1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f431e8e5602bb82e734a99f82c4ce350c061b61)

Developing the roastery costs 55K caps- er, dried cacao beans. This decision can be taken up to 7 times, and honestly, I had a fun time just chilling and building civilian factories for most of the game. I didn't get involved in The Flower Wars until 2279. That's 4 years of chilling and vibing.

There's also this mechanic:

[The Art of the Deal](https://preview.redd.it/c45faca8wtge1.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=e14fad80ba6af60d2092ac9bd1dad26c45be8009)

If Atzlan refuses to give you freedom, you can get access to similar decisions, but targeting them instead. Unfortunately I got dragged into the Flower Wars pretty quickly so I wasn't able to take advantage of these benefits, but hey, they're fun to interact with while they lasted.

[I love encirclements](https://preview.redd.it/vit5v3sjwtge1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=5511521a80f2d7f9159793b256af2a14695b321d)

[This was one fun campaign](https://preview.redd.it/eylq53zlwtge1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f784dccd67d6c367a48801b2e4f5f4de813815d)

[Make no mistake, I carried The Flower Wars](https://preview.redd.it/x7fw5cpqwtge1.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&s=298e4932034403a269478854fe06089be9186819)

And with that, my journey as Costa Cafeinada came to a close. There were plenty of navy-related focuses and customer-related focuses to complete, but let's be honest. If I cannot gain the NCR or New Victoria or anyone else as customers anyway, there's not much point in going down that part of the tree.

Overall, they are a fun nation to play, and I adore their focus on mercantalism and just building up industry and selling coffee to people. They would be a 7/10 if their intended mechanics worked, and even higher if they had more content or if their focus tree was expanded and their focuses kicked down from 50 days to 40 days. I don't have much else to say. Like I said earlier, the groundwork for a fun, playable nation is there, but some balance tweaks and some bug-fixes or a re-evaluation of how the nation's mechanics work is much needed.

1igdxkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1igdxkg/ratio_four_coffee_maker_full_review/,RATIO Four Coffee Maker - Full Review,"This is copy-pasted from the review I left on the site I bought it from. I really don't notice much buzz surrounding this machine, so thought I'd place my thoughts here too. I was torn between this and the Fellow Aiden, but with my usage the Aiden would ONLY be used in single-serve mode. Not worth such a large footprint/different modes for me.

Excellent coffee maker that brews the best coffee I've ever made at home (coming from an OXO Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker in the properly used single-serve mode). Here are some pros and cons:

Pros:  
\- Brews absolutely amazing tasting coffee no matter how much water I put in, anywhere between 5 and 20 ounces (while keeping a consistent coffee-to-water ratio) provides a consistent experience that does not require a change in grind size. Coming from the OXO, I would describe the flavour(s) as ""pulled out"" more; fuller  
\- Removeable water tank is incredibly lightweight, allowing me to weigh the water I add directly into it on my small, inexpensive kitchen scale that has a rather low weight limit  
\- Brew basket slides out instead of having to open a lid; machine sits tucked in on my counter with a floating cupboard above it, allowing me to be able to keep it in one small space  
\- Incredibly easy and effective to quickly rinse out removeable accessories (glass carafe, brew basket) and use them right away again, without having to worry about stains or residue  
\- The platform where the glass carafe is placed is completely flat, providing the option to place most mugs under the brew basket in order to brew directly into a mug

Cons:  
\- The single activation button is incredibly sensitive. It is not a button that clicks inward physically. Instead, it's a touch sensor. Any slight tap or touch against the button will fully activate Profile A and begin the full brew cycle. Since I mainly use Profile B (which requires holding my finger against the button for 3 seconds), I need to keep it unplugged until I want to use it so that when I handle other kitchen items around it, I don't accidentally brush the button  
\- Throughout the majority of the blooming/brewing process, the machine emits a quiet but shrill, high pitched whirring noise that is actually quite harsh on my ears. Other family members in the same space are not as bothered by this, so it may just be a personal quirk  
\- The entire top piece of the machine flexes downward if I push down on it (even lightly). I am a fan of the look and aesthetic of the machine overall, but the top piece feels flimsy

Overall, I will give this machine 5 stars because the cons really are not negative enough to give it 4. It's generally easy enough to just try and not touch the activation button, and the whirring noise isn't loud enough to the point where it's painful. I honestly expect an imperfect build quality from any coffee maker built with any type of plastic, but I do not think that the machine is able to be easily scratched or damaged at all. It's an amazing machine and I absolutely do not want anything else to brew my two daily mugs!",9,1738547545.0,pourover,2,0.91,False

EDIT: Commenters have indicated that my punch line is incorrect, however this was written in 2007 so I am not sure what happened in the interim! Clearly I need to return.\]

Years ago, I frequented a squalid cafe on the Stanford Campus called the Coffee House. At the time, I considered the place rank; the dark wood tables had a waxy patina from generations of graduate student sweat. I went there every night though, not because I loved it, but because I didn't have a car to go anywhere else. It was dark, too dark to study, but that didn't seem to stop anyone. It did have its virtues, and I recognized some of them at the time. The live music was both free and good; the Indigo Girls played there before anyone knew who they were. I remember having my first coffee there, and the caffeine high drove me to fall in love, at least temporarily, with the woman I was with (I still remember her fondly). One night I spent hours drinking beers with one of my philosophy teachers discussing a paper and thinking: this is what college is all about.

When I returned to Stanford for graduate school about five years later, the CoHo (how I hated that abbreviation) was pretty much unchanged. But my perceptions of the place had changed: it was no longer a rank cesspool, but rather an eidetic realization of the perfect college cafe. As an adult, I realized that the CoHo was a fucking cool place to be. Its dark wood benches now signified permanence and history.

Today I happened to be at Stanford and suggested to a friend that we meet at the CoHo for a drink. Together we drove to Tresidder Union to recapture a bit of youth. Through the window of the place I saw the glow of screens, many screens; there were a few laptops on nearly every table. And the place was bright; students who wanted to use the place to study had clearly complained about the lack of light. The old wood tables had been replaced by a light brown DuPont plastic. The chalkboard menu was gone. And, the ultimate insult: they no longer serve alcohol.

I mentioned to a girl in line who couldn't have been more than 19 that in the old days, the CoHo was a popular place to grab a beer. ""That's what my dad tells me,"" she replied without a hint of irony.",5,1738547399.0,stanford,7,0.78,False

We felt the need to sit down and talk face to face at a coffee shop. During this talk at the coffee shop he told me that he wanted to work on himself and he wanted to focus on work and his family. I asked if something was going on with his work and at home (because he lives with his family). He then answered, ""Everything is ok and nothing is going on."" I was so confused...

I then told him why exactly he is breaking up with me and he started to explain another reason. He said that he has anger issues and he wanted to go to therapy. I have never personally seen him angry before. I then asked, ""So you're breaking up with me because you have anger issues?"" He then starts frantically saying, ""No. No. No."" I was even more confused when this was said and I was starting to get frustrated.

I do not know what was going on and I asked him, ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" With no hesitation, he said, ""Yes."" I was starting to get even more upset. He then asked me if I needed a hug from him and I said, ""I don't know..."" I was already frustrated with him and so confused. The last thing I told him was, ""I hope you do not regret this decision."" I then stood up and walked away.

Later in the day, I unfollowed him both on his cosplay and personal instagram and that was it. He then proceeded to block me on every social media platform that we have followed each other on. He even blocked me on venmo and his personal phone so my phone calls and texts cannot reach him. I do not understand why he blocked me on everything. I feel as if he might have been influenced by a 3rd party interference (a friend, family member, a coworker?).

We had a super strong relationship and he just ending everything. There are days where I hope he unblocks me and talks to me about what's really going on but for now, I am completely blocked on everything.

We would try to meet every so often, but were in different countries and couldn‚Äôt make it work. Last year, she messaged me again, and for once we were in the same city. We went for a coffee date which went well and let to another date. 

I put effort into the second date, started with an Italian food market, went to the park after to watch the sunset, then gave her the choice between an arcade and boardgames, both of which I had reservations for. After an hour or so at the board games, we called it a night and I dropped her off. She gave me a kiss and I made my way home.

We tried to plan the third date, but something not another would come up with work, almost 2 weeks later she suggested a place and as I was about to leave, she said she‚Äôs still at work and I suggested we could do it another day and not to worry. 

I threw the ball in her court and said let me know when you‚Äôre free and we can reschedule. I didn‚Äôt hear anything for a couple months. So I replied to her story 4 months later, and she said dating wasn‚Äôt a priority for her, but she really enjoyed spending time with me. She said she would be down to go out again, but was travelling for a couple weeks and would be down after. I told her to let me know when she‚Äôs back and we can do something, and once again I haven‚Äôt heard anything from her. 

It‚Äôs been 2 months since, and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to message her again? Her messages seem genuine, but her actions seem otherwise. I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

I remember back around 2018-2019 when I first started to go I'd kind of base my Sunday mornings on going with a friend and take in the vibes/aesthetic with the plants and d√©cor watching the coffee making happen but now it's not even a shell of that. Not that I'd be greeted when I walked in back then but there was a warm atmosphere that kept me coming back and I felt like the coffee tasted and looked like everything I see now on social media. Now I'm lucky to get a coffee that I can finish past two sips.

I feel like the dying plants at the front window are almost a metaphor for how their business is starting to feel like to me - also the lack of any type of sit down furniture besides the bar isn't inviting. The whole place I think needs a slight cleaning and some DIY renovation that I think the owners are too busy with their social media marketing campaign to notice.

This is just specifically for the Providence location, haven't tried their others so maybe those are a different experience so forgive if I'm being too cynical!

Luckily there's Reprise and Bolt to keep the torch for me with great coffee and good vibes but it's just sad for me to see a place that I really enjoyed to kind of be a warped version of itself.

I finally learned why.,"You know the kind of town where everyone knows everyone? Where the local diner serves coffee in mugs stamped with your name, and everyone will lend a hand to a neighbor in need? A place where generations of families grew up together?

Well, that is the sort of place where I live. Sure, it is a bit rustic, hell I barely have reliable internet. But it is nice enough for us. It‚Äôs the kind of place where time feels like it‚Äôs standing still, except for one thing‚Äîthe nights. The nights here are a little different.

I‚Äôve lived here all my life, and there‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be. Or at least, that‚Äôs what I used to think. This place has its quirks, like any small town, but there‚Äôs a big one that stands out for us.

You see, every night, without fail, at 11:38 PM, the town‚Ä¶ locks down.

I‚Äôm not talking about just closing up shops and less people being out and about. I‚Äôm talking about a real lockdown. Door's slam shut and are barred, windows rattle and lock and everyone knows they have to be inside and stay inside, at least for what happens next.

The next part is strange, no one ever sees anything moving out there directly, but we all just know. We just know that somehow, something outside is trying to get in.

An eerie silence falls over the streets. It‚Äôs like the whole town is holding its breath. Then in twelve minutes exactly, it is just over.

I‚Äôve always wondered why it happens at exactly 11:38pm. People here don‚Äôt talk about it much, but when they do, they whisper. They say it‚Äôs just the way things are, that it‚Äôs been happening for as long as anyone can remember. But I know better. I‚Äôve seen it. Whatever it is.

The first time I noticed it; I was still pretty young. I think I was ten or eleven. I‚Äôd stayed up late reading some of my favorite comic books. My parents warned me like many other kids in town that we had to go to bed early, but if we did get up, then absolutely no leaving the house or leaving any windows or doors open.

I was not asleep, but was still following the rules, when I heard the strangest sound. It was a low, guttural hum that seemed to vibrate through the walls. I looked out the window, and that‚Äôs when I saw it. The streets were empty, but there was‚Ä¶ a presence. It‚Äôs hard to describe. It wasn‚Äôt a person or an animal. It was something else. Something that didn‚Äôt feel like it belonged. It moved with this strange, jerky motion, like it wasn‚Äôt entirely in control of its own body. It radiated a disturbing sense of distortion that made my head hurt and my eyes had a difficult time focusing on it. I could feel this overwhelming sense of hunger that made my skin crawl. Before I knew it, it was over. It had passed my house and I realized I had been staring out my window in a hypnotic daze. It was almost midnight and I went to sleep and did not tell my parents about the disturbing thing I had seen.

I didn‚Äôt see it again for years, but the feeling never left. Every night at 11:38 on the dot, when the town shuts down, I know it is there. We all try to act like it‚Äôs not. Just behave like we have a strict curfew and that nothing is really out there. Yet the people who are too bold or foolish and think that it‚Äôs nothing, well they don‚Äôt last long.

Those of us who are still here know that whatever that thing is, it‚Äôs out there. Stalking, hunting. Looking for anything, an open window, a cracked door.

Disappearances are frequent, especially for such a small town. The police have a whole song and dance for anyone who goes missing from the outside, but when it is a resident, well it is more of a case where the families of the victims are reprimanded for not having known better.

No one knows why the window of time is so mercifully brief. Almost just as suddenly as it starts, it‚Äôs over. By 11:50 PM, the streets are quiet again, and the town feels normal. But it‚Äôs not normal. It never was.

People here have learned to live with it. They lock their doors, shut their windows, and pretend it‚Äôs not happening. I asked my parents why we don‚Äôt just move and they never gave me a good answer. All they said was, ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt do any good. We have to endure. It has to be here. It is safer for everyone if it‚Äôs here.‚Äù It did not make sense, I know people can get attached to places but it felt crazy to me. I couldn‚Äôt just pretend this was normal, not after what I saw. Not after what I felt. There was something out there, and it was worse than anyone would believe.

It was just recently that I saw it again. It was a normal night, at least as normal as nights could be in my town. I was getting ready to go to bed, when I noticed that my cat Quincy was missing. I looked everywhere but I couldn't find him. Then I heard something and looked through the window to spot a familiar shape and my heart sank. He was outside!

He must have gotten out when I had come home earlier and was sauntering along the sidewalk, clueless to the impending danger. The time was 11:36pm. I had no idea if the creature did anything to animals, but I did not want to find out. I had never let Quincy outside before and he did not come back to my shouted calls for his return. I had to do something, something dangerous and stupid to save him. I rushed outside, sprinting toward him and trying to grab him and bring him in before it was too late.

I managed to reach him and pick him up. But then I froze when I sensed a presence as I was scrambling back to my door. Quincy‚Äôs ears folded back and he hissed. I felt paralyzed and then I thought I saw it again. It was different this time. Larger, and more overwhelming than before. Its presence seemed to fill the entire street, pressing against the houses like an unseen force. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. I was frozen in place, my breath caught in my throat.

To my horror it seemed to finally regard me. Quincy jumped out of my hands and ran back to my house. He had fortunately evaded whatever interest the thing might have had with him.

The creature's head twisted unnaturally in my direction, its distorted features coalescing into more recognizable shapes. Staring into the grotesque visage forced a scream out of me as I beheld the blasphemous impossibility. I turned and sprinted away, screaming like a maniac. My heart hammering against my ribcage with such force that each beat felt like it might crack my chest open. The sound of its pursuit echoed behind me, a wet slapping noise like a monstrous jellyfish gliding across the ground. Its deafening roar filled the air, shaking the ground beneath my feet as I ran for my life. I did not know if I could get away, no one I knew had been outside and survived.

I ducked into an alley, my hands shaking as I pressed myself against the wall. My breath came in short, sharp gasps, and I could feel sweat dripping down my face. I didn‚Äôt dare look around the corner. I didn‚Äôt dare move.

And then I heard the harrowing screams. They sliced through the air, piercing and full of terror. My heart raced as I strained to see who was making them, but all I could make out were shadowy figures caught in the open. The screams were short, sharp, and then they were swallowed by the night. The deafening silence that followed only added to the fear weighing down on me.

I stayed pressed against the wall, trying to make myself as small and invisible as possible. The darkness seemed to come alive with every creak and rustle, amplifying my fear. I held my breath until I heard the sound of the creature moving away. And then, just like that, it was gone.

But the eerie stillness lingered, haunting me even after the clock struck 11:50 PM.

The streets were once again quiet, but my nerves were still on edge. I stumbled back to my house, every step feeling like a race against time. Quincy waited anxiously at the door and bolted inside with me, seeking shelter inside.

The horrible night had left me shaken, but grateful to be alive. Whatever that thing is, it does not belong in this world. It is not of this time or place, and its presence is so unsettling, it makes your mind ache just to catch a glimpse of it. No one can tell of its origins, maybe they are lost in the depths of history. But whatever its history, it remains. Always there, lurking in the shadows every night without fail.

At that point I did the one thing you probably think everyone should have done by now, I left my hometown. I moved to the largest city I could reach to get away from it all. My parents did not approve, in fact they tried to tell me I could not go. I was so desperate to get out of there, that I had to sneak away in the early morning, when they could not interfere.

I never understood why we all stayed there and tried to ignore the eldritch nightmare that hunted us at night. It seemed so simple and I felt better at first. The city felt alive with the hum of traffic and the distant chatter of people during the day, a cacophony that made me feel safe, anonymous.

Indeed, I thought I‚Äôd left the nightmare behind, that the creature was just a memory, a relic of a past I could bury.

My new apartment is a cozy studio on the fifth floor, with a view of the bustling streets below. High enough where looking out the window does not fill me with dread at night.

Unfortunately, something happened last night that has shattered the fragile illusion of my peaceful transition.

On the first night in my new place, I sat on the edge of my bed, flipping through a magazine to distract myself from the creeping unease that had settled in the pit of my stomach. The clock on the nightstand read 11:28 PM. I told myself I was being paranoid, that the creature was gone, that I was safe now. But the weight of the past lingered, a shadow in the corner of my mind that I couldn‚Äôt shake.

By 11:38 PM, the city outside my window was eerily quiet. The usual sounds of traffic and distant music had faded, replaced by an unsettling stillness. I tried to focus on the magazine, but my eyes kept drifting toward the window, the darkness beyond the glass pressing in on me. And then, I heard it‚Äîa soft, tentative tap against the pane.

My heart skipped a beat. I froze, the magazine slipping from my fingers and falling to the floor. The sound was light, almost imperceptible, but it sent a chill coursing through my veins. I told myself it was nothing, I was just being paranoid. But then it came again‚Äîanother tap, this time more insistent.

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt breathe. My eyes were fixed on the window, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse with a life of its own. The tapping stopped, and for a moment, there was nothing but silence. Then, a faint scratching sound, like claws on glass. My heart sank. I knew that sound, I knew what it meant.

Slowly, with my legs trembling beneath me, I rose from the bed and approached the window. My hand reached for the curtain, hesitated, and then, with a deep, shaky breath, I pulled it back. What I saw made me freeze in terror. The creature was perched on the fire escape outside my window, its twisted form silhouetted against the moonlit sky. Its eyes glowed with an unnatural light, and its presence seemed to fill the room, pressing in on me with an unspeakable horror.

I tried to scream, but the sound caught in my throat. The creature‚Äôs head tilted to the side, its gaze locked on mine, and I felt a wave of dread wash over me. It was here. It had followed me. And then, as if in slow motion, its mouth opened, revealing rows of jagged teeth, and it let out a low, guttural growl. The sound shattered the paralysis that held me in place. I stumbled back, my voice finally breaking free in a raw, terrified scream. The creature‚Äôs form seemed to blur and shift, its presence filling the room with an unspeakable darkness. And then, everything went black.

I regained consciousness and I know it is not over. There is no escape from this thing that has followed me. I consider what my parents had said when I asked them why we never moved. Then, with dawning horror I realize the truth of their words. ‚ÄúIt is safer for everyone if it‚Äôs here. ‚Äù

They did not mean it was safer for us. They meant it was safer for everyone else. They knew the danger; they stayed to keep it there. Now in my ignorance, I have made a huge mistake. Somehow, it knew I left. It has followed me here, to a place where over a million people will soon know about its existence and maybe more if it moves beyond that. I am so sorry for bringing it here, I didn‚Äôt know.

Please for your own safety, stay inside between 11:38pm and 11:50pm. By now, it might not be safe wherever you are as well.",11,1738546630.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

I was very excited having passed my test and I was ready to pay whatever to drive that same day, but this year I want to be a bit smarter and get my cost as low as possible. So, some information about me.

I‚Äôm a medical student who works in a coffee shop on the weekend, single, use the car for social, domestic and commuting, and I (will hopefully) have a year of no claims bonus.

My question is, what tips/advice do you have for me to get the absolute lowest insurance possible, whilst still obviously having it valid in the event of an incident. 

I‚Äôm planning to find my quote a month in advance and set it to start as my current insurance expires so it‚Äôs as cheap as possible (I heard that‚Äôs how it works) and I will not be sticking with my current company as from what I understand they tend to keep it higher.

I‚Äôve always wondered why it happens at exactly 11:38pm. People here don‚Äôt talk about it much, but when they do, they whisper. They say it‚Äôs just the way things are, that it‚Äôs been happening for as long as anyone can remember. But I know better. I‚Äôve seen it. Whatever it is.

The first time I noticed it; I was still pretty young. I think I was ten or eleven. I‚Äôd stayed up late reading some of my favorite comic books. My parents warned me like many other kids in town that we had to go to bed early, but if we did get up, then absolutely no leaving the house or leaving any windows or doors open.

I was not asleep, but was still following the rules, when I heard the strangest sound. It was a low, guttural hum that seemed to vibrate through the walls. I looked out the window, and that‚Äôs when I saw it. The streets were empty, but there was‚Ä¶ a presence. It‚Äôs hard to describe. It wasn‚Äôt a person or an animal. It was something else. Something that didn‚Äôt feel like it belonged. It moved with this strange, jerky motion, like it wasn‚Äôt entirely in control of its own body. It radiated a disturbing sense of distortion that made my head hurt and my eyes had a difficult time focusing on it. I could feel this overwhelming sense of hunger that made my skin crawl. Before I knew it, it was over. It had passed my house and I realized I had been staring out my window in a hypnotic daze. It was almost midnight and I went to sleep and did not tell my parents about the disturbing thing I had seen.

I didn‚Äôt see it again for years, but the feeling never left. Every night at 11:38 on the dot, when the town shuts down, I know it is there. We all try to act like it‚Äôs not. Just behave like we have a strict curfew and that nothing is really out there. Yet the people who are too bold or foolish and think that it‚Äôs nothing, well they don‚Äôt last long.

Those of us who are still here know that whatever that thing is, it‚Äôs out there. Stalking, hunting. Looking for anything, an open window, a cracked door.

Disappearances are frequent, especially for such a small town. The police have a whole song and dance for anyone who goes missing from the outside, but when it is a resident, well it is more of a case where the families of the victims are reprimanded for not having known better.

No one knows why the window of time is so mercifully brief. Almost just as suddenly as it starts, it‚Äôs over. By 11:50 PM, the streets are quiet again, and the town feels normal. But it‚Äôs not normal. It never was.

People here have learned to live with it. They lock their doors, shut their windows, and pretend it‚Äôs not happening. I asked my parents why we don‚Äôt just move and they never gave me a good answer. All they said was, ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt do any good. We have to endure. It has to be here. It is safer for everyone if it‚Äôs here.‚Äù It did not make sense, I know people can get attached to places but it felt crazy to me. I couldn‚Äôt just pretend this was normal, not after what I saw. Not after what I felt. There was something out there, and it was worse than anyone would believe.

It was just recently that I saw it again. It was a normal night, at least as normal as nights could be in my town. I was getting ready to go to bed, when I noticed that my cat Quincy was missing. I looked everywhere but I couldn't find him. Then I heard something and looked through the window to spot a familiar shape and my heart sank. He was outside!

He must have gotten out when I had come home earlier and was sauntering along the sidewalk, clueless to the impending danger. The time was 11:36pm.  I had no idea if the creature did anything to animals, but I did not want to find out. I had never let Quincy outside before and he did not come back to my shouted calls for his return. I had to do something, something dangerous and stupid to save him. I rushed outside, sprinting toward him and trying to grab him and bring him in before it was too late.

I managed to reach him and pick him up. But then I froze when I sensed a presence as I was scrambling back to my door. Quincy‚Äôs ears folded back and he hissed. I felt paralyzed and then I thought I saw it again. It was different this time. Larger, and more overwhelming than before. Its presence seemed to fill the entire street, pressing against the houses like an unseen force. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. I was frozen in place, my breath caught in my throat.

To my horror it seemed to finally regard me. Quincy jumped out of my hands and ran back to my house. He had fortunately evaded whatever interest the thing might have had with him.

The creature's head twisted unnaturally in my direction, its distorted features coalescing into more recognizable shapes. Staring into the grotesque visage forced a scream out of me as I beheld the blasphemous impossibility. I turned and sprinted away, screaming like a maniac. My heart hammering against my ribcage with such force that each beat felt like it might crack my chest open. The sound of its pursuit echoed behind me, a wet slapping noise like a monstrous jellyfish gliding across the ground. Its deafening roar filled the air, shaking the ground beneath my feet as I ran for my life. I did not know if I could get away, no one I knew had been outside and survived.

I ducked into an alley, my hands shaking as I pressed myself against the wall. My breath came in short, sharp gasps, and I could feel sweat dripping down my face. I didn‚Äôt dare look around the corner. I didn‚Äôt dare move.

And then I heard the harrowing screams. They sliced through the air, piercing and full of terror. My heart raced as I strained to see who was making them, but all I could make out were shadowy figures caught in the open. The screams were short, sharp, and then they were swallowed by the night. The deafening silence that followed only added to the fear weighing down on me.

I stayed pressed against the wall, trying to make myself as small and invisible as possible. The darkness seemed to come alive with every creak and rustle, amplifying my fear. I held my breath until I heard the sound of the creature moving away. And then, just like that, it was gone.

But the eerie stillness lingered, haunting me even after the clock struck 11:50 PM.

The streets were once again quiet, but my nerves were still on edge. I stumbled back to my house, every step feeling like a race against time. Quincy waited anxiously at the door and bolted inside with me, seeking shelter inside.

The horrible night had left me shaken, but grateful to be alive. Whatever that thing is, it does not belong in this world. It is not of this time or place, and its presence is so unsettling, it makes your mind ache just to catch a glimpse of it. No one can tell of its origins, maybe they are lost in the depths of history. But whatever its history, it remains. Always there, lurking in the shadows every night without fail.

At that point I did the one thing you probably think everyone should have done by now, I left my hometown. I moved to the largest city I could reach to get away from it all. My parents did not approve, in fact they tried to tell me I could not go. I was so desperate to get out of there, that I had to sneak away in the early morning, when they could not interfere.

I never understood why we all stayed there and tried to ignore the eldritch nightmare that hunted us at night. It seemed so simple and I felt better at first. The city felt alive with the hum of traffic and the distant chatter of people during the day, a cacophony that made me feel safe, anonymous.

Indeed, I thought I‚Äôd left the nightmare behind, that the creature was just a memory, a relic of a past I could bury.

My new apartment is a cozy studio on the fifth floor, with a view of the bustling streets below. High enough where looking out the window does not fill me with dread at night.

Unfortunately, something happened last night that has shattered the fragile illusion of my peaceful transition.

On the first night in my new place, I sat on the edge of my bed, flipping through a magazine to distract myself from the creeping unease that had settled in the pit of my stomach. The clock on the nightstand read 11:28 PM. I told myself I was being paranoid, that the creature was gone, that I was safe now. But the weight of the past lingered, a shadow in the corner of my mind that I couldn‚Äôt shake.

By 11:38 PM, the city outside my window was eerily quiet. The usual sounds of traffic and distant music had faded, replaced by an unsettling stillness. I tried to focus on the magazine, but my eyes kept drifting toward the window, the darkness beyond the glass pressing in on me. And then, I heard it‚Äîa soft, tentative tap against the pane.

My heart skipped a beat. I froze, the magazine slipping from my fingers and falling to the floor. The sound was light, almost imperceptible, but it sent a chill coursing through my veins. I told myself it was nothing, I was just being paranoid. But then it came again‚Äîanother tap, this time more insistent.

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt breathe. My eyes were fixed on the window, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse with a life of its own. The tapping stopped, and for a moment, there was nothing but silence. Then, a faint scratching sound, like claws on glass. My heart sank. I knew that sound, I knew what it meant.

Slowly, with my legs trembling beneath me, I rose from the bed and approached the window. My hand reached for the curtain, hesitated, and then, with a deep, shaky breath, I pulled it back. What I saw made me freeze in terror. The creature was perched on the fire escape outside my window, its twisted form silhouetted against the moonlit sky. Its eyes glowed with an unnatural light, and its presence seemed to fill the room, pressing in on me with an unspeakable horror.

I tried to scream, but the sound caught in my throat. The creature‚Äôs head tilted to the side, its gaze locked on mine, and I felt a wave of dread wash over me. It was here. It had followed me. And then, as if in slow motion, its mouth opened, revealing rows of jagged teeth, and it let out a low, guttural growl. The sound shattered the paralysis that held me in place. I stumbled back, my voice finally breaking free in a raw, terrified scream. The creature‚Äôs form seemed to blur and shift, its presence filling the room with an unspeakable darkness. And then, everything went black.

I regained consciousness and I know it is not over. There is no escape from this thing that has followed me. I consider what my parents had said when I asked them why we never moved. Then, with dawning horror I realize the truth of their words. ‚ÄúIt is safer for everyone if it‚Äôs here. ‚Äù

They did not mean it was safer for us. They meant it was safer for everyone else. They knew the danger; they stayed to keep it there. Now in my ignorance, I have made a huge mistake. Somehow, it knew I left. It has followed me here, to a place where over a million people will soon know about its existence and maybe more if it moves beyond that. I am so sorry for bringing it here, I didn‚Äôt know.

Please for your own safety, stay inside between 11:38pm and 11:50pm. By now, it might not be safe wherever you are as well.",28,1738546587.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

1igdl7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1igdl7z/a_speech_if_anyone_in_louisiana_wishes_to_use_at/,A speech if anyone in Louisiana wishes to use at a protest.,"My fellow Americans and Louisianians. We are gathered here today for one thing and one thing only: to save our democracy.

We are not here to encourage violence. We are not here to attack. We are here to spread awareness.

Please, my friends, families, from different religions and nationalities, and even the law enforcement and politicians, please hear me out until the end. It is all I ask; then I will let you all decide what you wish to do.

America was always designed from the ground-up as a huge marketplace, a place where people can come together.

Where ideas become dreams and dreams become realities. Where stories get passed on and whatever is passed on is cherished, loved, and learned.

Louisiana has been a huge boiling pot of a variety of dishes and one thing that we can all agree and come together with is food.

Thousands, millions to this day have come to Louisiana to share and mix into our culture to let traditions live and allow us to create something new.

Jambalaya, inspired by the Spanish paella and African dish jollof; Boudin, inspired by Germany and France; Gumbo, inspired by west Africa and France; and red beans and rice, from the Caribbean and Haiti.

Thanks to the food, we have blossomed like the satsuma trees that came from Japan and have come together to share and sing stories, especially when it came to those creole ladies. From Bourbon Street to Esplanade.

Now that we know that we share these things in unity, I ask you to hear my message. I will not attack you. I will not silence you. I will not label you like you label me. All I want you to know is to be aware of what is going on.

The first weeks of the presidency has resulted in a myriad of emotions: majority leading in either apathy or intense fear.

The days have either been the same or a distant past.

I know some of you have made almost-daily visits to your favorite place for lunch or breakfast.

The server who knows you when you walk in.

That knows you that you want two cups of coffee, with 3 packs of sugar and 2 creamer. And definitely not the pot in the back, it just doesn't work right for some reason.

They put your usual order in. Two eggs, two extra crispy bacon strips, and two slices of French toast.

That server always had a friendly smile on their face, knew what you want, and was like a friend you stopped by to see everyday.

Now that friend is gone.

All because of the color of their skin. All because of how different they look. All because of how they identified.

Despite having legal documentation, being born in the USA, they were taken away with no one to defend them and no questions asked.

You come home early from work. Your little girl from 6th grade is crying. She was always happy. You asked why.

The ICE, also known as Immigration's Customs Enforcement, went to her school and pulled out a lot of students, one of them being her best friend Carmellia.

Carmellia was your little girl's best friend since kindergarten. Two peas in a pod. Now, she will never see her again. A piece was ripped away from your daughter.

Your sister works a government job. A veteran regional office. A stressful job, helping veterans who sacrificed their lives for their very country, with benefits, programs, in order to help them out of the street-where they constantly deal with the never-ending battle of traumatic memories that play on repeat each day.

She comes home. She sits down with her husband. She says ""We need to talk.""

Meanwhile, your brother, at no fault of his own, who lost his leg in a near fatal accident with a drunk driver and has a weak right leg, can no longer work. He needs medicine to at least get around to do basic needs. Now, without access to the Medicaid site, he cannot update his new information. Because of that, he may not be able to get his medicine.

Now, like many federal programs, are being pressured to be bought out, pushed out, and/or be frozen in ordered to be controlled.

The federal workers right now, are standing firm on their position and refuse to back down. Despite the way we mistreated them. Despite the way they are overworked.

To all federal workers: we hear you. We see you. We feel you. We appreciate you. You are the shield to our democracy.

To law enforcement, to the navy, to the air force, to the military, before this country becomes the opposite of what it is, may I ask who are you working for? Are you working for your upper-classmen? Are you working for your president? Or are you working for the American people, who you sworn to protect and serve for their lives and rights?

The time may have already run out for you, so please take a moment and think about it. How do you feel the state of things are now? Are you following orders? Are you following written instructions? Or are you following the core values of what makes America what it is?

My fellow Americans and Louisianians, please look to left and right. Please look at the person, who may be a friend you have never met. Please look at the next person, who you may mistaken as an enemy, for a simple misunderstanding.

Please, I ask you to collect your thoughts. It's okay to be wrong. It's okay to swallow your pride. It's okay to be not okay.

But I will say this: despite the differences we have now, it is okay to unite.

Thank you.",2,1738546505.0,50501,2,0.75,False

- this one is a bit harder but how to explain or ask if they want an ice coffee with a little cream or a latte? bc a lot of the time they order iced coffee or hot coffee but 8/10 they want a latte on the menu.

1igdj88,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1igdj88/best_friend_advice_needed_asap/,Best friend advice needed ASAP,"Hey Reddit, I have an ex best friend of mine: Z is what we will call her. When we were younger, (think freshly teenagers) she stopped the friendship. I had gone to summer camp and come back as part of a trio while she was away out of state for the summer (she had asked me to go but I couldn‚Äôt).  She was upset I spent so much time with them when she got back bc she thought we were supposed to hang out. Mind you she didn‚Äôt tell me she was back until she got here. She said basically ‚Äòit‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ I need a break so I can‚Äôt do this anymore, maybe one day we can mend things‚Äô
After that we didn‚Äôt talk for 6 months and I sent her a birthday card. Then for my birthday 4 months later she called me. Every year since then (3) she has called for my birthday and been very interested in talking to me. She has even reached out a time or two to connect about random talking points. That‚Äôs all the contact we have had. 
I have been seeing her everywhere since the last time we called for my birthday almost a year ago. Ppl will know her, she‚Äôs come to my work twice and the first time had no idea who I was. I‚Äôve seen her on social media too. 
So, a week ago I texted her:
Me: hey how are you I‚Äôd like to catch up lmk if you‚Äôd like not to be contacted again.

Her: (HOURS later) I‚Äôm so sorry! Yes I‚Äôd love to! I‚Äôve missed our friendship. How are you I am good.

Me: I‚Äôm glad you said that I had no idea! Maybe coffee?? I‚Äôm good!

Her: sounds great.

We went on to talk abt her gf and it was surface level and she has not responded since then. I even texted again to make plans.
Should I give up? Or should I go for it and just call? She says she never checks her messages. But she has posted on social media since we‚Äôve talked. I don‚Äôt want to seem like I am desperate, tbh I just went for it. But now I don‚Äôt know what the next steps are if there are any. 

I feel like I should give some more info. I‚Äôve had mixed signals from friends on what to do. We both are in happy relationships. And I do miss her but know that she may not be what I think. I‚Äôve seen that she has a whole life outside of me.

Another edit: my friend suspect she may have a had a small crush seeing as she was so jealous and also took me camping and wanted me on the trip with her. She can also be a bit controversial as in being gay but not wanting that for her kids, part of the reason we didn‚Äôt mesh was the maturity difference but I‚Äôm curious bc she seems more alike to me now. She‚Äôs gone more alternative and may have more in common with me?",5,1738546340.0,TwoHotTakes,12,1.0,False
1igdj87,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1igdj87/aio_or_is_this_creepy/,AIO or is this creepy?,"(37f) I used to be close to my cousin (27m). He didn't have the easiest life growing up and I always thought we had a brother/sister type relationship. He got engaged to a girl a few years ago and she clearly doesn't like me. I'm not usually the type to try and get someone to approve of me but with her I really tried (for him) and it was terrible. 

They got married and I didn't go to the wedding. The fact that she didn't like me and was jealous of his relationship with me (weird) came out via texts he sent to me of their private conversations (that I didn't ask to see nor did I want to), and I didn't feel comfortable going. By this time my cousin and I had already drifted bc he wasn't allowed to hangout with me alone. Not kidding. This was a thing. One time he came to my house to show me his new car and I went to take a pic of it and he panicked and said ""don't post that, she can't know I'm here."" I felt like the other woman and it was creepy. Mind you, I did nothing to this girl. Never stepped on her toes or even had words with her. 

He decided to completely remove me from his life after I fully explained why I didn't feel comfortable attending the wedding. More on that decision if you need to hear it. I stand by my choice (especially now lol). I saw them at my sister's wedding and said hello, she responded and he totally ignored me and walked away. 

A year later (recently) he texts me to talk it out. We  aired our grievances and all was well. He wanted to meet for coffee so I agreed and he said his wife had to come, I said that's fine. Turns out he lied to her completely and told her I texted him to apologize and that I also said I'm sorry to her. Literally didn't  happen that way at all. He also had to wait days to tell her we were on speaking terms again. 

 Now they're having a baby. She invited me to the shower and I couldn't make it and this is TOTALLY on me but I didn't RSVP. I knew it was wrong but I knew he was going to flip and I just didn't want to deal with it. Again, I'm wrong. I just think that anxiety I had over his most likely reaction speaks volumes. He deleted and blocked me from social media during the baby shower. Like as it was in progress. Two weeks later he unblocked me, texted me telling me off, and kept watching my stories for like two days until I finally blocked him. 

His text telling me off basically said I'm a bad person and I can never make it right in his eyes (ok, so why are you texting me??) and that I would have to earn my relationship back with him.

 Did I overreact by blocking him? I seriously just want nothing to do with him and it's exhausting. I don't have the time for this shit. Our relationship is so weird, everyone says it since he's been with this girl...it's literally like I'm the other woman. He also speaks to our entire family like he's a victim of ours and everything him and the wife do is rooted in this need to prove we are worthy of their attention attitude. His wife (before the shower) went around telling people that she doesn't want us near her baby lol yet we were invited to the shower. We also seriously did nothing to this girl. 

 Little background on her: she threw a tantrum the day my cousin bought her ring bc he said he was golfing and she was mad he didn't call her enough. So he had to propose that night to get out of the fight. He was planning to surprise her months later but that was all ruined over a tantrum. She also started dating my cousin by cheating on her previous boyfriend and my cousin found out on their second date. ",3,1738546340.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False
1igdivk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1igdivk,Tried the Omakase on Celebrity Apex ‚Äì Here‚Äôs What It Was Like,"I had the chance to try the Omakase on Celebrity Apex (one of the Edge-class ships) in January 2025. Since there aren‚Äôt many reviews yet, I wanted to share my experience.

This was a small, intimate dinner with only eight guests, all seated together at a shared table. My party was four people so we were seated with another group of four. Because of the limited seating, it sells out fast, so I booked a couple of months in advance.

The experience began at Caf√© Al Bacio, where we were served a small appetizer of edamame. From there, we walked upstairs to Raw on 5, where we sat at a large circular table beneath a beautiful chandelier. Before the meal started, they took a group photo. Since we didn't have time to get to know each other yet, it was a bit awkward‚Äîyou can tell in the picture. But we all warmed up to each other in the end and were sharing stories as we were sipping on tea and coffee at the end of the meal. I‚Äôm glad to have the photo as a memory, and it was free to take home as a print, which was a nice touch.

The atmosphere felt polished yet relaxed, and the servers were incredibly coordinated, making the whole evening feel special. It's sometimes hard to tell the difference between the service for specialty dining versus main dining, but this was a clear step up from both.

Then came the food‚Äîabsolutely outstanding. There was a fixed menu with eleven courses. There was an optional wine/sake pairing for an extra charge, which around half of the people opted into. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like everything on the menu, but I loved every bite. Each time a course was served the food was explained. The flavors were diverse and balanced as you would hope and expect from this type of experience. I genuinely enjoyed each dish I had. I was often surprised by the flavors. Those from my group who had tried Raw on 5 thought the sushi was better quality than similar ones from the normal menu. The portions were just right‚ÄîI left feeling full but not overly stuffed, which made it easy to savor everything.

It‚Äôs hard to describe every dish in detail, so I‚Äôve attached pictures instead. Since this is an Omakase experience, the menu will vary, but hopefully, these give you a sense of what you might expect. Overall, this was the most memorable meals of the trip, and I‚Äôd absolutely do it again.",17,1738546310.0,celebritycruises,6,1.0,False

1igdifm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1igdifm/th_horizon/,[TH] HORIZON,"The alarm rang at exactly six. The shrill sound filled the small apartment, but he was already awake. He ran his hand over his tired face, feeling the roughness of his unshaven beard. He got up slowly, dressing with the same calmness of someone following a ritual. He chose a faded blue shirt and pants that had seen better days. His reflection in the mirror showed deep dark circles and empty eyes.

In the kitchen, he made a strong coffee. The aroma spread through the room, bringing memories of distant mornings when life seemed to follow a predictable course. Now, every sip was bitter, as if it carried all the weight he tried to ignore. His eyes fell on the pile of envelopes next to the door. Overdue bills, threatening collections, debts that seemed to grow like shadows around him. He took a deep breath and looked away. That was no longer his problem.

He finished his coffee and pushed the envelopes aside with his foot. He grabbed the apartment keys, took a deep breath, and left, leaving behind the mess that had become his life. He climbed the stairs slowly, step by step. Seven floors. A long journey for someone carrying so much invisible weight. As he walked, fragments of his short life came to mind. Childhood laughter, teenage dreams, promises never fulfilled. They were distant memories, as if they belonged to someone else.

When he reached the rooftop, he found the building's janitor, an elderly man, tending to the service area. They exchanged a discreet nod. The young man sat on the edge of the building, his feet dangling over the void, as he often did. The janitor didn‚Äôt find it strange; he had seen him there before, silently contemplating the city.

""Beautiful day today,"" the old man remarked, not interrupting his task.

""Yeah, beautiful,"" the young man replied, his voice drawn out, as if words were extra weight to carry.

The old man moved a little closer, looking at the horizon. After a while, he asked:

""What are you thinking about, boy?""

The young man hesitated but answered:

""About life. If it's worth it... If it makes sense.""

The janitor sighed and sat beside him, keeping some distance.

""I think each person finds a different meaning. But I can tell you one thing, after all these years: we only understand life when we look back, but we can only live it by moving forward.""

The young man laughed without humor.

""Nice phrase. But what if there's nowhere left to go?""

The old man looked at him seriously.

""There's always somewhere to go. Sometimes the problem is that we want an easy path, a quick solution. But life was never about shortcuts.""

The young man lowered his eyes. He felt the weight of the janitor's words, but something inside him had already been decided.

""And you? Have you ever wanted to give up?"" he asked, looking at the man beside him.

The old man smiled, but there was sadness in his gaze.

""More times than I can count. But every time I thought about it, I found I could hold on for just one more day. And then another. Until one day, I realized the pain had passed.""

The young man stood up slowly, standing on the edge of the building. His gaze met the old man's, who only then noticed the quiet tears running down the young man's face. A heavy feeling settled in his chest.

""Hey, kid..."" he began, but was interrupted.

Before he could react, the young man closed his eyes and gave himself to the void.",1,1738546274.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

1igdgfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1igdgfz/i_30m_am_really_done_with_her_37f_but_she/,I (30M) am really done with her (37F) but she apparently isn't. But she's mad all the time.,"We have had a relationship for around 3 years. At first things were easy peasy, although we were kinda living over our possibilities: Monthly little trips, weekly dinners at fancy restaurants, weekly (or more) home delivered food. I didn't like to make such amount of expenses and I am actually happy just being home with my hobbies, but it's hard for her to stay at home for a weekend without getting on her toes.

It wasn't easy conversation but after a while we agreed to not spend so much. This has kind of been a stab for the relationship because our life together was kinda built around it. I don't feel like we fell on routine, but it is true that I spend more time on my hobbies whereas she doesn't really have one and the time we spend together the talking has gone more scarce to say the less. I don't particularly feel this is bad: I think that when you have a couple for so long and you have some weeks with less plans or social interaction it is normal to have less conversation. She's been all January and weekends studying for exams so... Regular stuff I think.

She is really unhappy with this. I told how I feel about it, but she then said we don't really do anything unless she does something. With this she is meaning telling me about events in the city and that kind of stuff. 99% of the times none of both is really interested and she just knows everything because she's a lot in social networks and follows everything. I do have social network accounts but barely use them. I told her it is great that she tells me about things around but also that I don't find wrong that I do the same. So she just said she is done with doing all the work on the relationship and now is my time.

This kind of feels like forcedfully ramped up because I told her last week about having a calendar for chores. She is really lazy and most of the chores are up to me. I sometimes brought this matter very gently but she really seems to believe she does more than I do. I work from home so when I'm having a coffee break or something I'm cleaning the kitchen, the living room, etc. I was planning to drop the chores calendar after her exams but was kind of feeling guilty for not telling her or that just casually dropping it all planned could feel violent for her or something so I told her and well. Next day she had asked AI to make her a draconian chore list (I told her I already had it more or less figured out) so she got mad and said I disrspected the work she put into doing the chore table (AI did lol) and why didn't I tell her before.

Anyways... Yesterday we went for dinner at a restaurant. We went by cab and I waited until she was ready to call because if I try to call a little earlier we end up making the cab to wait. After I called I did some ""rushy"" comments like ""cmon take the coat"" and little things like that which apparently really twisted her mood. She was tense at the restaurant. She was talking to me about her studies, her friends, etc, I was just being supportive. Restaurant was a little loud so at a certain point I asked her to please repeat a phrase I didn't hear well and she toned up a LOT. Like wanting to make both the loud near table and me that she was mad. I don't think I need to comment about that behavior. I just made a little, discrete gesture with my hand which only made her keep ramping up and complain about ""how when she talks at a low volume it's too low buy when she tones up it's too much"".

Anyways dinner ended and she was uncomfortable so I thought she'd want to go back home. But we ended in some pub having a drink. We started talking about us, she said she's been kind of unhappy for around a couple months, I tried to stay positive, comprehensive and supportive. She talked about how her friendships are kind of drying and at some points she was subtly hinting about her not being so happy with how our life is being lately. At some point talking about his friends she said something like: ""Well, I don't know, maybe I just need to change friends and boyfriend"".

I was visibly hurt. Shortly after we went home and kept talking about our life and stuff like nothing happened. We slept, next morning I overslept while she was studying, kind of tense lunch... Then she was back studying.

After she ended she came to the room I was, like expecting me to say something. So we started talking. That's when she poured all the stuff about being up to date with possible events to attend, etc. I also told her that I think it's normal that we have our time for our hobbies. She said I don't try to do anything with her, to which I responded that it's quite hard when she never really wants to watch any movie I say, not any show I propose, it doesn't matter what I bring to the table, it's nearly impossible to watch or do anything coming from me. But she circled back, all while screaming and ocassionally mocking me. I was still managing to stay nice, talk about communication, how sometimes I may have not get the wave of what she wanted to do and trying to do better. The few times I got to speak screams or mockery just increased.

I am so tired. We have had so many beautiful moments together. She is a strong person and find her amazing in some matters. But I feel like we just have different ways to enjoy life or live our relationship. And I also feel like things could have been different if she could tell me things without yelling. It's like really bad anger/frustration management, like she does absolutely nothing wrong and I don't feel frustrated about the chores situation or a number of other things that I please asked her for the three whole years.

Another issue coming up is about a wedding of a friend of mine we are attending late summer. It is in another country so it is getting more expensive by the day we don't have flying tickets. I already told her that if the final date and place are announced too late to be affordable I will say no to my friend and problem solved. But she isn't happy with that either because we instead would need to book a summer vacation elsewhere, when I said to her several times I would just let January go through in case an announcement is made or ask my friend directly this february. She kept ranting about the whole thing telling how ""she doesn't make much money so needs to be thoughtful about spending"" when she is spending a good amount of money on Doordash at least weekly and she still owes me over a thousand bucks from more than a year ago of which I haven't seen a penny back.

Everything feels harder than it should be. Feels like everything has to go the way she wants. And she talks to me like I'm absolutely terrible as a boyfriend. Comparisons with exboyfriends are common when she's mad... Sigh.

1igddqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCanada/comments/1igddqa/canadas_tariff_retaliation_a_necessary_defense_or/,Canada's Tariff Retaliation: A Necessary Defense or Economic Risk?,"With the recent announcement of Canada imposing **$155 billion in tariffs** on U.S. goods in response to unjustified U.S. tariffs, opinions are flying left and right. The government claims this move is to protect Canadian interests, consumers, workers, and businesses. But is this the right approach?

To break it down, the first phase targets $30 billion worth of goods, including items like orange juice, peanut butter, wine, spirits, beer, coffee, appliances, apparel, footwear, motorcycles, cosmetics, and pulp and paper. An additional $125 billion worth of goods, including passenger vehicles, trucks, steel and aluminum products, certain fruits and vegetables, aerospace products, beef, pork, dairy, and recreational vehicles, will follow.

Some argue this is a strong stance to defend our economy. After all, the U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods have been widely criticized as unfair and damaging to our industries. By imposing these retaliatory tariffs, Canada is sending a clear message that we won't back down and will take measures to protect our own economic interests. This could potentially force the U.S. to reconsider its position and negotiate more favorable trade terms.

However, others worry about the potential retaliation from the U.S. and the impact on Canadian consumers and businesses. Tariffs generally lead to higher prices for goods, which can hurt consumers who have to pay more for everyday items. For businesses, especially those that rely on imported materials and products, the increased costs could strain their operations and reduce their competitiveness. There‚Äôs also the risk that prolonged trade tensions could lead to job losses in industries affected by tariffs.

The larger question is whether these tariffs will actually achieve the desired outcome. Can they effectively protect our economy without triggering a trade war that could have broader negative consequences? Historically, trade wars have shown that they often end up harming both parties involved, leading to economic slowdowns and strained relations.

Another aspect to consider is the political implications of these tariffs. The move is likely to be popular among certain segments of the population who feel that Canada needs to assert itself and stand up to unfair trade practices. However, it could also lead to backlash from those who believe that diplomacy and negotiation should be the primary tools for resolving trade disputes. The upcoming elections might also play a role in how this issue is perceived and debated.

Overall, this situation raises important questions about the balance between protecting national interests and maintaining healthy international trade relations. It's a complex issue with no easy answers, and the long-term effects remain to be seen. As we navigate these uncertain times, it's crucial to stay informed and engaged in discussions about our economic policies and their impact on our daily lives.

1igda6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1igda6d/a_tribute_to_my_perfect_girl/,A tribute to my perfect girl,"On Thursday, January 30, 2025, just one day shy of her fifth gotcha day anniversary, we held our Bertie in our arms as she drifted from this precious life of hers. When we drove to the vet that afternoon, we never imagined we'd be spending our last moments with her. The doctor kept coming out with worse and worse news and eventually uttered the word euthanasia. Our heads spun as we considered her options. She had severe internal bleeding, likely from a ruptured tumor. We made the hardest decision an animal companion ever has to make.

I know one day these traumatic final hours at the hospital will give way to the five beautiful years we shared together. Sometimes she would fart as she came up the stairs, as the little hop with each step forced it out of her. Pizza was her favorite food. One time in Brooklyn she stole a whole half a pie off the coffee table. She chased that high for the rest of her life. When she'd walk fast, her ears would flop up and down. Her ears were so soft. I loved to kiss them. When she would lean in to sniff me, I'd lean in to sniff her. I loved the way she smelled. It definitely gave me a rush of oxytocin. She wasn't big on snuggling or affection, but whenever we picked her up from the kennel, she always wanted to hold my hand, and sometimes I'd keep my hand in the backseat the whole way home, and she'd rest her head on it, as if to say I missed you so much. I missed her dearly whenever we left her at the kennel. On trips I'd ask my husband every day, ""What do you think bertie is doing?""

I called her my little grunty grunty. She was expressive with her breath and would grunt like a little piglet if she was displeased, as a sort of sigh. She was the coziest girl I ever knew, always searching for the best, most comfortable spot. One time we visited our friends and they (completely reasonably) didn't want her on the couch. She tried and we stopped her several times, and each time she'd resign to a hard spot on the floor, looking totally forlorn. Another time, we were at home and I could tell she needed to elevate her head ever so slightly. My husband was near her, so I asked him to put the blanket under her head. He did, only it was still a little too flat. I asked him to put a little more, and it still wasn't quite right. I asked him one more time, and my husband shook his head in disbelief but obliged... Then all of a sudden Bertie snuggled dramatically into the perfectly positioned blanket, nice and cozy. My husband was amazed that's what she needed, and it was really something seeing my attention and care toward her through his eyes. 

In recent years she got really bad, jumping up on the counter to get snacks and begging at the dinner table‚Äîlike really begging, making terrible groans and dramatic paws. ""Who trained you!"" I'd say. The past few days, we've been reflecting about how glad we are she got to have this rebellious phase. We spoiled her and we don't regret it for one second.

She taught me to walk slow and take note of the world. She wanted to sniff everything and I let her. This slowing down allowed me to notice every bush, every tree, every sprouting bud and bloom in the spring and every falling leaf in the fall. I'd often have my camera with me on our walks, and we'd alternate stopping to sniff and stopping to snap photos. I will take this beautiful gift of slowness and awareness with me for the rest of my life.

She taught me how to really care for someone, to dive so deep into dedication and commitment, to make personal sacrifices, and about the joy and fulfillment this could bring. With every single decision I made every single day, I considered how it would impact her. She needed this from me‚Äîshe needed so much from me‚Äîand it was often very hard on me and my husband, but we gave her everything we could. She was an anxious dog and suffered from severe separation anxiety. But we learned how to accommodate her and make her comfortable. I've been saying that I was (am) tethered to her. I could look her in the eye and know exactly what she needed. It was such a privilege to be able to take care of her and see her flourish. In recent years, friends would remark how much happier, calmer, or friendlier she seemed. Because we gave her everything she needed. 

It's bringing us great comfort now that she's gone, knowing all that we gave her. It's also part of why losing her has been so hard. I have all of this love and care and attention to give and nowhere to put it. As I move through my days, my brain is still constantly considering her. I know this will get easier as we adjust to our new reality. And in a few months we will have a baby to pour this care and attention into. But for now, I just miss her so much. I'm trying to remind myself of this wonderful life we shared and everything she taught me. I'm trying to remember the joyful moments, the peaceful moments, the sweet, everyday moments. She meant so much to me, and she always will. I will carry her with me forever. Rest easy, my perfect girl. I love you like the moon loves the sun.",4,1738545582.0,Petloss,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôve lived here all my life, and there‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be. Or at least, that‚Äôs what I used to think. This place has its quirks, like any small town, but there‚Äôs a big one that stands out for us.

The next part is strange, no one ever sees anything moving out there directly, but we all just know. We just know that somehow, something outside is trying to get in.

An eerie silence falls over the streets. It‚Äôs like the whole town is holding its breath. Then in twelve minutes exactly, it is just over.

I‚Äôve always wondered why it happens at exactly 11:38pm. People here don‚Äôt talk about it much, but when they do, they whisper. They say it‚Äôs just the way things are, that it‚Äôs been happening for as long as anyone can remember. But I know better. I‚Äôve seen it. Whatever it is.

The first time I noticed it; I was still pretty young. I think I was ten or eleven. I‚Äôd stayed up late reading some of my favorite comic books. My parents warned me like many other kids in town that we had to go to bed early, but if we did get up, then absolutely no leaving the house or leaving any windows or doors open.

I was not asleep, but was still following the rules, when I heard the strangest sound. It was a low, guttural hum that seemed to vibrate through the walls. I looked out the window, and that‚Äôs when I saw it. The streets were empty, but there was‚Ä¶ a presence. It‚Äôs hard to describe. It wasn‚Äôt a person or an animal. It was something else. Something that didn‚Äôt feel like it belonged. It moved with this strange, jerky motion, like it wasn‚Äôt entirely in control of its own body. It radiated a disturbing sense of distortion that made my head hurt and my eyes had a difficult time focusing on it. I could feel this overwhelming sense of hunger that made my skin crawl. Before I knew it, it was over. It had passed my house and I realized I had been staring out my window in a hypnotic daze. It was almost midnight and I went to sleep and did not tell my parents about the disturbing thing I had seen.

I didn‚Äôt see it again for years, but the feeling never left. Every night at 11:38 on the dot, when the town shuts down, I know it is there. We all try to act like it‚Äôs not. Just behave like we have a strict curfew and that nothing is really out there. Yet the people who are too bold or foolish and think that it‚Äôs nothing, well they don‚Äôt last long.

Those of us who are still here know that whatever that thing is, it‚Äôs out there. Stalking, hunting. Looking for anything, an open window, a cracked door.

Disappearances are frequent, especially for such a small town. The police have a whole song and dance for anyone who goes missing from the outside, but when it is a resident, well it is more of a case where the families of the victims are reprimanded for not having known better.

No one knows why the window of time is so mercifully brief. Almost just as suddenly as it starts, it‚Äôs over. By 11:50 PM, the streets are quiet again, and the town feels normal. But it‚Äôs not normal. It never was.

People here have learned to live with it. They lock their doors, shut their windows, and pretend it‚Äôs not happening. I asked my parents why we don‚Äôt just move and they never gave me a good answer. All they said was, ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt do any good. We have to endure. It has to be here. It is safer for everyone if it‚Äôs here.‚Äù It did not make sense, I know people can get attached to places but it felt crazy to me. I couldn‚Äôt just pretend this was normal, not after what I saw. Not after what I felt. There was something out there, and it was worse than anyone would believe.

It was just recently that I saw it again. It was a normal night, at least as normal as nights could be in my town. I was getting ready to go to bed, when I noticed that my cat Quincy was missing. I looked everywhere but I couldn't find him. Then I heard something and looked through the window to spot a familiar shape and my heart sank. He was outside!

He must have gotten out when I had come home earlier and was sauntering along the sidewalk, clueless to the impending danger. The time was 11:36pm.  I had no idea if the creature did anything to animals, but I did not want to find out. I had never let Quincy outside before and he did not come back to my shouted calls for his return. I had to do something, something dangerous and stupid to save him. I rushed outside, sprinting toward him and trying to grab him and bring him in before it was too late.

I managed to reach him and pick him up. But then I froze when I sensed a presence as I was scrambling back to my door. Quincy‚Äôs ears folded back and he hissed. I felt paralyzed and then I thought I saw it again. It was different this time. Larger, and more overwhelming than before. Its presence seemed to fill the entire street, pressing against the houses like an unseen force. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. I was frozen in place, my breath caught in my throat.

To my horror it seemed to finally regard me. Quincy jumped out of my hands and ran back to my house. He had fortunately evaded whatever interest the thing might have had with him.

The creature's head twisted unnaturally in my direction, its distorted features coalescing into more recognizable shapes. Staring into the grotesque visage forced a scream out of me as I beheld the blasphemous impossibility. I turned and sprinted away, screaming like a maniac. My heart hammering against my ribcage with such force that each beat felt like it might crack my chest open. The sound of its pursuit echoed behind me, a wet slapping noise like a monstrous jellyfish gliding across the ground. Its deafening roar filled the air, shaking the ground beneath my feet as I ran for my life. I did not know if I could get away, no one I knew had been outside and survived.

I ducked into an alley, my hands shaking as I pressed myself against the wall. My breath came in short, sharp gasps, and I could feel sweat dripping down my face. I didn‚Äôt dare look around the corner. I didn‚Äôt dare move.

And then I heard the harrowing screams. They sliced through the air, piercing and full of terror. My heart raced as I strained to see who was making them, but all I could make out were shadowy figures caught in the open. The screams were short, sharp, and then they were swallowed by the night. The deafening silence that followed only added to the fear weighing down on me.

I stayed pressed against the wall, trying to make myself as small and invisible as possible. The darkness seemed to come alive with every creak and rustle, amplifying my fear. I held my breath until I heard the sound of the creature moving away. And then, just like that, it was gone.

But the eerie stillness lingered, haunting me even after the clock struck 11:50 PM.

The streets were once again quiet, but my nerves were still on edge. I stumbled back to my house, every step feeling like a race against time. Quincy waited anxiously at the door and bolted inside with me, seeking shelter inside.

The horrible night had left me shaken, but grateful to be alive. Whatever that thing is, it does not belong in this world. It is not of this time or place, and its presence is so unsettling, it makes your mind ache just to catch a glimpse of it. No one can tell of its origins, maybe they are lost in the depths of history. But whatever its history, it remains. Always there, lurking in the shadows every night without fail.

At that point I did the one thing you probably think everyone should have done by now, I left my hometown. I moved to the largest city I could reach to get away from it all. My parents did not approve, in fact they tried to tell me I could not go. I was so desperate to get out of there, that I had to sneak away in the early morning, when they could not interfere.

I never understood why we all stayed there and tried to ignore the eldritch nightmare that hunted us at night. It seemed so simple and I felt better at first. The city felt alive with the hum of traffic and the distant chatter of people during the day, a cacophony that made me feel safe, anonymous.

Indeed, I thought I‚Äôd left the nightmare behind, that the creature was just a memory, a relic of a past I could bury.

My new apartment is a cozy studio on the fifth floor, with a view of the bustling streets below. High enough where looking out the window does not fill me with dread at night.

Unfortunately, something happened last night that has shattered the fragile illusion of my peaceful transition.

On the first night in my new place, I sat on the edge of my bed, flipping through a magazine to distract myself from the creeping unease that had settled in the pit of my stomach. The clock on the nightstand read 11:28 PM. I told myself I was being paranoid, that the creature was gone, that I was safe now. But the weight of the past lingered, a shadow in the corner of my mind that I couldn‚Äôt shake.

By 11:38 PM, the city outside my window was eerily quiet. The usual sounds of traffic and distant music had faded, replaced by an unsettling stillness. I tried to focus on the magazine, but my eyes kept drifting toward the window, the darkness beyond the glass pressing in on me. And then, I heard it‚Äîa soft, tentative tap against the pane.

My heart skipped a beat. I froze, the magazine slipping from my fingers and falling to the floor. The sound was light, almost imperceptible, but it sent a chill coursing through my veins. I told myself it was nothing, I was just being paranoid. But then it came again‚Äîanother tap, this time more insistent.

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt breathe. My eyes were fixed on the window, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse with a life of its own. The tapping stopped, and for a moment, there was nothing but silence. Then, a faint scratching sound, like claws on glass. My heart sank. I knew that sound, I knew what it meant.

Slowly, with my legs trembling beneath me, I rose from the bed and approached the window. My hand reached for the curtain, hesitated, and then, with a deep, shaky breath, I pulled it back. What I saw made me freeze in terror. The creature was perched on the fire escape outside my window, its twisted form silhouetted against the moonlit sky. Its eyes glowed with an unnatural light, and its presence seemed to fill the room, pressing in on me with an unspeakable horror.

I tried to scream, but the sound caught in my throat. The creature‚Äôs head tilted to the side, its gaze locked on mine, and I felt a wave of dread wash over me. It was here. It had followed me. And then, as if in slow motion, its mouth opened, revealing rows of jagged teeth, and it let out a low, guttural growl. The sound shattered the paralysis that held me in place. I stumbled back, my voice finally breaking free in a raw, terrified scream. The creature‚Äôs form seemed to blur and shift, its presence filling the room with an unspeakable darkness. And then, everything went black.

I regained consciousness and I know it is not over. There is no escape from this thing that has followed me. I consider what my parents had said when I asked them why we never moved. Then, with dawning horror I realize the truth of their words. ‚ÄúIt is safer for everyone if it‚Äôs here. ‚Äù

They did not mean it was safer for us. They meant it was safer for everyone else. They knew the danger; they stayed to keep it there. Now in my ignorance, I have made a huge mistake. Somehow, it knew I left. It has followed me here, to a place where over a million people will soon know about its existence and maybe more if it moves beyond that. I am so sorry for bringing it here, I didn‚Äôt know.

Please for your own safety, stay inside between 11:38pm and 11:50pm. By now, it might not be safe wherever you are as well.",2,1738545487.0,u_BadandyTheRed,0,1.0,False

I work at a coffee shopManager has done many things that are consider illegal. He steals the tips, schedules people to work 6-7 days per week, doesn't allow people to take breaks or makes the schedule in a way that people don't have a break or have it after 6-7 hours, he fires people just because he didnt like them,  doesn't pay on time and payment is often incomplete, I could keep going, but everything is so bad, to the point every single person wants to quit.

But the straw that broke the camel's back was when he forced me to go to work when I had a surgery. I had an accident that required a minor sugery, although it wasn't too bad the doctor told me I needed some time to rest and heal, he suggested 2 weeks. I told my manager and he was okay with that. 2 days later He suddenly schedule me to work, I told him I couldn‚Äôt and explain the whole situation for the third time.

He blamed me saying that I never mentioned any surgery to him, when I showed him the email proving that I had, he then blamed me again for not telling him about my accident and surgery a month in advance. I told him that I could go back to work in 5 days but that I couldn't do any activity that required a lot of effort, and that I was still putting my health at risk. He is so upset because he wants me to come back ASAP because he needs to go on vacation tomorrow and nobody else can work.

I am more than upset that he thinks his vacation is more important than my health.

I don't want to look like an idiot quitting, I think it I have plenty of reasons to quit but I also need money.

We never had any lines, took a few coffee/food/wandering breaks. Since we were there to site-see, we mapped out the route with prayer times in mind to be respectful of those there to pray.

Sultan Ahmed Mosque
Bayezid II Mosque 
Suleymaniye Mosque 
Selimiye Mosque

In this guide, we‚Äôll explore the science behind¬†**teeth whitening**, discuss the best¬†**at-home whitening kits.**

# How Does Teeth Whitening Work?

Before diving into the best gadgets, let‚Äôs understand how¬†**teeth whitening**¬†actually works. Stains on your teeth fall into two categories:

* **Extrinsic stains**¬†‚Äì These are surface stains caused by everyday consumables like coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco. They affect the outer enamel layer of the teeth and are generally easier to remove with¬†**whitening treatments**.
* **Intrinsic stains**¬†‚Äì These stains originate from inside the tooth, often caused by aging, genetics, or certain medications. These stains are more challenging to eliminate, requiring stronger¬†**whitening agents**¬†like¬†**hydrogen peroxide**¬†or¬†**carbamide peroxide**¬†to penetrate deeper layers of the enamel.

Most¬†**teeth whitening products**¬†use one of these peroxides to break down stains through oxidation. Some newer products also incorporate¬†**LED light technology**, which enhances the effectiveness of the whitening agent by accelerating chemical reactions, making the process faster and more efficient.

# Causes of Tooth Discoloration

Tooth discoloration can occur for various reasons, including lifestyle habits, aging, and medical conditions. Here are the most common causes:

* [**Dietary Habits**](https://medhouse.info/en/what-is-cholesterol/)¬†‚Äì Frequent consumption of coffee, tea, red wine, and dark-colored foods can lead to stains.
* **Smoking and Tobacco Use**¬†‚Äì Nicotine and tar from tobacco create yellow or brown stains on the enamel.
* [**Aging**](https://medhouse.info/en/tag/healthyaging/)¬†‚Äì Over time, the enamel wears down, exposing the naturally yellow dentin underneath.
* **Poor Oral Hygiene**¬†‚Äì Infrequent brushing and flossing allow plaque and tartar buildup, leading to discoloration.
* **Medications**¬†‚Äì Certain antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline), chemotherapy, and excessive fluoride exposure can cause staining.
* **Genetics**¬†‚Äì Some people naturally have darker or more yellowish teeth due to genetic factors.

Recently, gardens full of cultural sensibility have become part of the city's daily life. There is art, coffee, and the spirit of challenge of Busan and local businesses. Busan is a travel destination where you can get both a little relaxation and heart-pounding excitement. You can also make a New Year's resolution while watching the sun rise over the sea.


There is a place that has emerged as a representative ‚Äòhot place‚Äô in Busan these days. It is ‚ÄòDomoheon‚Äô, a complex cultural space in Namcheon-dong, Suyeong-gu, which was remodeled from the former Busan mayor‚Äôs residence. It was fully opened in September of last year after undergoing remodeling work in 2021. Over 120,000 people have visited so far.


Entering Domoheon, it feels like walking through the Blue House grounds. Along the walking path, 40,000 trees of 149 species, including old pine trees, are planted. In fact, it was built in 1984 as the president's local residence and was called the ""Blue House of the region."" It was later used as the official residence of the mayor of Busan. It was completed by famous Korean architects.


Domoheon means ‚Äòa space where anything can be freely pursued.‚Äô

The name of Moheon‚Äôs garden is ‚ÄòSoso Picnic Garden‚Äô. It means ‚Äòa garden where you can have a small picnic‚Äô. There, wild flowers such as bluebells, ferns, and cucumbers, as well as recycled outdoor furniture, create a peaceful atmosphere. The wide lawn garden with a distant view of Gwangan Bridge is a green canvas of freedom where you can lie down, walk, or run around. Last September, it was designated as the first open garden created by the state and local governments in Busan.

Dekho, mujhe toh laga tha ki main bas ek normal insaan hoon, jo chill hai, jo apni bestie ka third-wheel banne ko bhi tayyar rehti hai, jo uske love life ke cute moments ‚ÄúAwww‚Äù bol ke enjoy karti hai. Par nahi. Ek ""cute"" bolne ki deri thi, aur main ekdum homewrecker‚Ñ¢ type villain ban gayi. üò≠üíÄ

Scene Flashback:

Us din jab usne casually bola ""Oh, you look cute today,"" maine bina kisi dhamakedaar soch ke normal thank you bol diya. BUT, meri bestie ke expressions aise change hue jaise maine uska NEET ka form galti se delete kar diya ho. üò≠ Matlab, Maha-Pralay level tension start ho gaya.

Uske aankhon me ekdum woh Bollywood slow zoom-in wala gussa tha. Pehle socha, shayad mood off hoga‚Ä¶ par fir jab poori shaam uske sarcasm levels top tier peak pe rahe, tab samajh aaya‚Äîbhai, yeh kuch bada kaand ho gaya hai. üíÄ

Fir raat ko mujhe DM aaya:
""Tu aur woh‚Ä¶ kabse?""

Aur bhai, main ekdum brain.exe has stopped working. üò≠üò≠
""BEHEN, KYA?! KAB?! KAISE?! KUCH BHI?!""

Mujhe laga, bas ek baar explain kar dungi ki bhai, usne casual bola tha, koi Ashiqui 3 chal nahi rahi yaha‚Äîpar nahi bhai, ladki ka dukh, duniya ka sabse bada mystery hota hai. üò≠ Pura emotional rollercoaster mode on. Uska ""Tu bata bhi sakti thi na"" tone aisa tha jaise main kisi underworld love triangle ka secret leke ghoom rahi thi. üíÄ

Agle din jab maine dekha bhai ne full ‚Äòdamage control‚Äô mode activate kar diya‚Äîcoffee, croissant, sunset, best dialogues‚Äîtab mujhe samajh aaya:

1. Banda full red zone se nikalne ki koshish kar raha hai.


2. Woh waqai innocent hai, bas dimaag ki speed thodi slow hai. ü§°



Aur jab finally bestie ka gussa pighalne laga, tab mujhe bhi sukoon mila. Matlab, shukr hai, main best friend ki ""ex-bestie"" nahi bani. üò≠üî•

Moral of the story:

Kisi bhi bande ko casually 'cute' bolne se pehle confirm kar lo ki uski GF na sun rahi ho.

Relationships sirf love se nahi, damage control aur mehnat se bhi banti hain. üíÄüíñ

Best friends ke emotions ek alag hi cryptic code me likhe hote hain, jo duniya ka koi bhi AI decode nahi kar sakta. üò≠

It‚Äôs not a new friend so I don‚Äôt feel too uncomfortable about it; however when he told me about his day he mentioned that they had been talking about her recent break up and it just seemed quite emotionally intimate.  Since that he‚Äôs been a bit different with me over text and on phone and I‚Äôm due to see him again on Tuesday. I don‚Äôt know how to communicate my concerns and maybe if anything I‚Äôm just trying to see if this is legitimately something to worry about and wondering why.

He is fairly insecure which I was worried about at the start especially if we ever have any minor conflict. I don‚Äôt know if some insecure people have potential fall back dates

For 10 minutes or so it felt like a PVC every few beats. I got so freaked out that I ended up calling 911 and went to the ER. While in the ER though it went away and after waiting about two hours I decided to go home. Almost every day after that I was feeling more than usual. Today I finally went to the ER again as I was feeling them a lot. I was on the fence about whether to go or stay home but after standing up from my desk to go to the kitchen I had what felt like several PVCs in a row and I actually thought I would drop. 

I got checked out, ECG was normal, electrolytes (even magnesium and calcium) were normal. He says PVCs are usually harmless but since I haven't had a holter in about a year he will order one and an echocardiogram and that the hospital should call me in a week, I showed him an ECG I took at home which had 6 PVCs in a 30-second recording. It's after seeing that when he mentioned he will order the holter and echo. Nothing much has changed in my life. I don't drink, smoke or even drink coffee. I imagine both tests will be normal but I hate this. The only thing he mentioned about treatments is to maybe go on beta blockers and to check with my Cardiologist. ",1,1738544232.0,PVCs,1,1.0,False

Officials were paid off so your family was untouchable. Or so they thought. You wanted to get your MBA and be a businesswoman to help others. You had a boyfriend that you were going to marry and have a family with. But, that all changed as you, your parents, and boyfriend went out to dinner together. All of a sudden, there was a shootout against a rival gang. Your parents were shot and your boyfriend tried to stick up to you, but he ended up getting shot too. They left you alive to be forced to endure that trauma. You had to go through therapy and still had nightmares and terrors. After cohesion from the gang‚Äôs higher ups, you decided to take control of the gang. You went from being the sweet, bubbly, person that you were to being cold hearted, fueled with revenge, and straight to business. You found the rival gang and pretty much ended them. Instead of pursuing your dream of creating a business, you decided to allow your family‚Äôs mob business to continue. People feared you and that if anyone dared to look at you the wrong way, they would endure your wrath. You were in need of an assistant.

I was walking out of a coffee shop and saw a young person struggling with their car. The battery died and they were trying to move it into a parking space that was on the other end (the only available spot and their friend was holding it down so they could get their car out of the way.) I dropped my bag into their car and told them to get in the drivers seat so they could steer and I went to the back of the car to start pushing. I ended up pushing that car into the parking space about two thousand feet away up an incline in the parking lot. Something I would have never been able to do a year ago.

I know the manual says 10-40 for espresso but that‚Äôs a huge range. Is there a number that most people start on (like 21 or 24 or something) and go from there? 

Also, do I need to calibrate the grinder out of the box, to ensure 0 is at the chirp point?

1igchym,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1igchym/got_ghosted_after_he_kissed_me/,Got ghosted after he kissed me,"Went on a first date with this guy. We had a 2.5 hour coffee date in which we chatted about a lot of things. Throughout the date I was trying to be playful so I teased him a bit, which he took well. He also kept giving me that ‚Äúin-love kind of look‚Äù where they kinda just stare at you and smile for a moment. He also kept talking about continuing this conversation later and going on a second date. Anyway fast forward, he says he has to go and he walks me to my car. He asks if he can kiss me and I say yes. We kiss and then I go home.

After that, he did not text me, so I texted him thanking him for the date, he replies kinda dryly and says he had a good time.

Today, I texted him asking him what his plans are this week. No response. I‚Äôm positive I‚Äôm ghosted bc I see that he is active on Instagram. I just don‚Äôt understand. Kissing me then ghosting me is absolutely crazy. 

Has anyone went through this? I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it",0,1738543287.0,dating_advice,10,0.5,False
