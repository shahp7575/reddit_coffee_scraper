1pxq36c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1pxq36c/has_anyone_ever_doubted_themselves/,Has anyone ever doubted themselves?,"My gastritis started over a year ago, after a year of drinking 4-5 coffees every day, skipping breakfast, working from 9 am to 10 pm, and after the death of a beloved pet.

At first, I associated the stomach pain and pressure in my throat with terrifying anxiety. I made several changes in my life that seemed appropriate at the time (I broke up with my partner at the time—don't take it the wrong way, because the relationship was already quite strained, but I thought it was because I wanted to leave him and that was causing the discomfort).

But it's true that the months went by and my stomach pain didn't improve. In fact, I started getting sore throats, sharp pains in my stomach, and my entire digestive system felt irritated (throat, pit of my stomach, etc.). I came to the conclusion that I had incredible heartburn. Several months later I had a gastroscopy and it showed I had acute gastritis with stomach ulcers between 3 and 7 mm. I was prescribed proton pumps for four months and it's true I improved, but after stopping them, the same symptoms returned (heartburn, reflux, sore throat, pain in the pit of my stomach...).

What I'm trying to say is that even though I know I have gastritis and that it's causing my symptoms, I don't know why I associate those symptoms with anxiety and it makes me feel terrible. I know that anxiety has other symptoms that I don't have (palpitations, hair loss...) but even so, I'm worried that deep down I'm causing it myself.

I know it sounds crazy, but it would really help me if you could share your experiences so I don't feel so alone in this. Regardless, I have more tests on January 29th to continue monitoring my stomach issue and see if it finally improves.

Thank you so much and stay strong 🫶",1,1766924435.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

We both work hospitality.
She is the DM for a small restaurant/coffee place and I (promoted) am the GM for a small beach bar.
We are regulars in each others establishments.
Her coming into mine with friends and family and I go into her work for coffee and a quiet place to sort work bits on the laptop. 

We got talking quite a bit and flirted a lot, mainly in jest as the age gap did put me off to begin with but over time we realized we had a lot in common. More so than I would have expected. 

Just over 4 months ago she asked me out on a date.
Just lunchtime coffee.
I was apprehensive at first but aside from the age gap, I couldn't think of a reason to say no. So we went out together. 
And what was just supposed to be coffee turned into 12 hours of more fun and laughter then I've had in years.
I asked her at the end if the age gap bothered her and she just gave me this look and simply said ""No""

We went out on date 2 a few days later. Just a couple of drinks and an evening walk along the beach with some chips and wound up at this play park. She bet I couldn't keep up with her, I proved I could. We laughed so much and then it got cold.
We huddled up ander this big wooden climbing frame out of the wind and cold and the conversation turned to talking about our families, hopes and dreams and what we wanted out of a relationship.
We wanted the same thing which surprised me.
As we got up to leave, she got up too fast and whacked her head on a low beam.
I picked her up and sat her down on a wall to check her head and made a joke about kissing it better and asking where it hurt and she pulled an Indiana Jones on me (bonus points if you get that reference) 
And we shared our first kiss and we walked back to our starting point hand in hand and really struggled to part.

It's been a bit of a whirlwind since then. 
Date 3 was me cooking her dinner at my place and she stayed.
She's met my family and they love her and I've met hers and they've been nothing but supportive of us both. 
We spend most days and nights together, myself at hers or vice versa. 
Last week we had a talk about red flags and both admitted that there hadn't been any. 
Both admitted to falling in love with each other and we spent Christmas together. 
Christmas Day with my family and Boxing Day with hers. 

We've joked about finding a place together that we can do up together but at times it doesn't feel like we're joking.

So my question would be this. 
She knows I've posted this and is also curious what people think. 

If it feels right, should we just bite the bullet and try to get a place together?

1pxpysw,https://i.redd.it/xfy6qs99sx9g1.jpeg,Kojako / Apex Primals 🦖💥,"
🦖💥 Kojako Ruso — The Ultimate Bistahieversor of Destruction

Full Name: Kojako Ruso
Age: 32
Birthday: December 25, 1993

Race: Bistahieversor Tribe / Portuguese

Role: The Ultimate Bistahieversor of Destruction, Member of the Apex Squad

Alignment: Anti-Hero

Residence: Roaring Sor Forest (Apex World)

😏 Personality:

Kojako Ruso is calm, calculating, and highly intelligent in battle, possessing an amazing battle IQ. He often takes extremely long naps and has a noticeable lack of kindness, though he genuinely tries to improve himself. Kojako is an excellent mentor when it comes to combat styles and training.

However, he is highly opinionated and easily angered—if someone disagrees with him or offers what he believes are “better” suggestions, he may yell loudly and lose his composure. He is unpredictable, strange, and often acts evil in an unsettling, theatrical way.

Kojako has an extreme love for meat and food in general. Despite his rough nature, he has a surprisingly soft spot for females who are kind to him and make him feel special, often treating them gently and respectfully. He also enjoys acting flamboyant and dramatic, especially when confident or amused.

🍔 Food & Drinks:

Water, coffee, fried chicken, hamburgers, fish, ham sandwiches, bacon, scrambled eggs, vanilla cake (birthday), garlic bread, popcorn, pineapples, mangoes, baked tomatoes, rice, green beans, and cornbread.

💥 Powers & Abilities:

Secret Fang Instincts: (Special Move) An ancient and terrifying ability that allows Kojako to instantly bite an opponent, unleashing billions of fang strikes in a single moment. One successful attack is enough to defeat and cause an opponent to faint instantly without fail. This technique can even bite into universal-level attacks and reverse techniques in a single bite, ending the battle immediately.

Ultimate Berserk Finisher: (Special Move) Kojako enters a berserk state where his speed becomes nearly impossible to track. While berserk, he dodges attacks effortlessly and delivers devastating punches that destroy an opponent’s body structure and regeneration abilities. He can absorb all abilities during this state infinitely and gains unmatched speed that makes striking him virtually impossible.

Gruesome Mega Fangs: (Special Move) This move allows Kojako to bite directly into powers and abilities, breaking them in a single bite without resistance. He can chain psychic attacks with his jaws and throw them back at opponents instantly. The raw force of this ability reaches approximately 900,000,000,000 in power output.

Hard Royu Pulse: (Special Move) Kojako senses his surroundings and detects incoming power or abilities before they reach him. He then moves at extreme speed and delivers a Hard Royu Pulse that paralyzes opponents, inflicts intense pain, and prevents movement. This attack can even affect the opponent’s soul, leaving them unable to fight.

Electric Spear:Kojako wields an electric spear that never misses. The attack paralyzes opponents, drains their strength and speed, disables regeneration, and completely nullifies their abilities through overwhelming electric force.

Feanix Spear Force:A defensive and offensive force used primarily while dodging. This power slows enemy strength and attack power while protecting Kojako from being trapped, even within illusions. It allows him to escape any form of confinement mid-movement.

Infinite Power Absorption:Kojako can absorb any ability or power used against him, converting it into raw strength. The more powerful the opponent’s attacks, the stronger Kojako becomes, endlessly increasing his attack and striking power.

Body Resistance:Kojako possesses extreme resistance to steel-based abilities, fire, copying abilities, reality bending, ability cancelation, slashing attacks, and power reversal or reflection. Even when his abilities are turned against him, he receives no damage.

Insane Sensing:Kojako has unlimited sensing capabilities, allowing him to predict attacks before they occur. He can maintain this ability endlessly without fatigue, foresee an opponent’s next move, and react faster than time, space, and light-speed movement when positioned correctly.

Ultimate Shield:Kojako can curl into a powerful shielded form that negates status effects, flinching, and debuffs. Opponents who strike him—physically or through abilities—experience slowed movement and reduced combat effectiveness.

🤝 Relationships:

Cinphia (Love / Affection):Kojako deeply loves Cinphia, though he struggles to express it openly. He respects her greatly and longs to confess his feelings, believing she is the most beautiful owl hybrid he has ever seen.

J (Best Friend):J is the only person Kojako truly considers worthy of his full strength. He enjoys battling J and respects him deeply, though he believes J is often clueless and rarely fights at 100% power.

Cellicia (Great Friendship / Affection):Kojako sees Cellicia as playful and mischievous. Though her talkative nature annoys him, he feels protective of her and treats her like a younger sibling.

Derark (Student):Kojako sees Derark as a promising student. Though initially confused by his resemblance to J, he enjoys training him and appreciates his presence, believing he can teach Derark things J cannot.

Stripes (Rival):Kojako views Stripes as a rival with incredible speed. He finds Stripes’ anger amusing and acknowledges his kind heart and warrior strength.

Deroze (Rival):Kojako considers Deroze an extreme threat and a terrifying monster, responsible for killing 1,000,000,000,000 hybrids in a single day. He never underestimates him and fights with complete seriousness.

Mino (Neutral):Kojako finds Mino bossy yet calm. While Mino’s good decision-making often irritates him, Kojako does not hate him—he simply dislikes how correct his opinions tend to be.

🌳Summary Overview:

Kojako Ruso is one of the most powerful hybrids in the Apex World, known for living alone in the deadly Roaring Sor Forest, where only the strongest survive. When he first met J, Kojako felt conflicted—unsure if J was truly worthy of traveling beside him. Their early friendship was strained, as Kojako constantly sought to be right and dominate every situation.
Through countless journeys, failures, and battles, Kojako learned to cooperate with J and his crew. Along the way, he unlocked devastating techniques and unexplored abilities, growing into his role as The Ultimate Bistahieversor of Destruction. Kojako is not a warrior meant to be faced alone—he is destruction itself, and crossing his path is a mistake no one survives.

1pxpxrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pxpxrr/coffee_yes_or_no/,Coffee - yes or no?,"Hello :)

I am 20 and I’ve never really drunk coffee. But some time ago I came into a video by a doctor talking about it. I expected it to have more cons than pros, but he was almost praising it, I’m not kidding 😄. He used a lot of scientific terms and studies talking about physical benefits only.

But I thought that coffee can not be like a magic pill, otherwise everyone would consume it (thought everyone knows that back in the 20th century smoking was considered almost as a medicine too). 

So I looked into the question a little bit: I watched a lot of videos, read people’s thoughts on this (both who quit and still drink coffee), I read some articles and even asked chat GPT of course xd. And the information differs a lot. One group says that there is no harm from coffee or even its beneficial, while other group states it is actually a drug.

Here is what I remember from both sides:

1st group for coffee: it has a lot of healthy and unique nutrients, antioxidants and probiotics in it. It helps heart etc.. Also it increases concentration and efficiency 

2nd group against coffee: it builds tolerance (so you need more coffee for the same effect), withdrawal syndromes occur when you stop drinking coffee, it has a stimulating effect on you and your nervous system; it causes addiction -> it is a drug. 

Also it makes your breath and your skin smell bad; your teeth become yellow; it decreases sleep quality; you lose your motivation without coffee, you become addicted to it (you can not start doing something without it) and a lot of other psychological problems caused by coffee

Today was my first day trying homemade coffee and maybe it was placebo, maybe it was not, but I felt some boost in concentration. It felt somehow not natural to me, since I’ve never consumed anything, that affects my mind in any way: no alcohol, nicotine, or a lot of caffeine (except of tea once in few days) and few years ago I quit any kind of sugar except of fructose. 

So what is your opinion on this? Do you think people should rather quit coffee or is it healthy and natural boost when it’s used correctly (before 14:00, not on an empty stomach, once in few days)?

P.S. Just to clarify in advance: I’m not looking for advice about alcohol, sugar, or nicotine. Avoiding them is a conscious and well-thought-out choice for me, and I’ve heard the “you have to try everything while you’re young” argument many times already. I’d prefer to keep the discussion focused on coffee itself.",4,1766923918.0,selfimprovement,4,1.0,False

# Beyond the Daily Grind: What Makes Coffee ""Specialty""?

That morning cup might be doing more than just waking you up. Specialty coffee is a world away from your average brew, focusing on quality, traceability, and exceptional flavor. It’s about appreciating the journey from bean to cup, understanding the nuances that make each sip unique.

What separates specialty coffee? It begins with the bean. These are meticulously grown, harvested, and processed coffee cherries, often from specific micro-lots or single origins, highlighting the unique terroir of their growing region. Roasters then expertly profile roast them to unlock delicate flavor notes, moving beyond the expected ""coffee"" taste into realms of fruit, floral, or even chocolatey complexity. Finally, baristas prepare it with precision, ensuring the brewing method perfectly complements the coffee's inherent characteristics.

*   **Traceability:** Know exactly where your coffee comes from – farm, region, and sometimes even the specific varietal.
*   **Flavor Complexity:** Discover tasting notes far beyond bitter or bold, like bright citrus, sweet berry, or rich caramel.
*   **Quality Focus:** From farm to cup, every step is managed to ensure the highest possible standard for a superior taste experience.

Ready to elevate your coffee experience? Visit your local specialty coffee shop and ask your barista for a recommendation based on your flavor preferences.

1pxpvas,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxpvas,"I Was the Lie He Loved, Then the Truth He Lost","I'm a liar. And I fell for New York's golden boy.

To make him marry me, I faked everything.

Said I was a trust fund heiress who studied abroad. Built this whole fake life.

I actually believed if I played it right, I could fool him into loving me forever.

Then I heard him with his buddy:

""Dude, I actually feel bad for your liar wife.

She can't get pregnant, and yesterday your mom made her kneel in the snow!

But you got a vasectomy years ago...""

Hearing that, something crossed Ashford's face.

Almost looked like guilt. ""I promised Jade her son gets everything. So Elara can't have kids. That was always the deal.""

His friend laughed. ""You're still obsessed with Jade, huh?

""I mean, makes sense though. When Jade married your brother, your family treated her like trash. So you married Elara to take the heat off Jade instead.
""Elara has no idea you told your whole family she's a fake from day one...""
I froze on the spot.
Turns out, I'd been a joke all along.
Alright. From now on, I live for myself.
But after I left? Ashford went completely PSYCHO.
...
Inside the VIP room.
Ashford stared at his whiskey. Didn't say anything for a minute.
Finally, he spoke.
""Jade came from nothing. I needed someone disposable. A liar I could pretend to be crazy about. That way my mom would go after Elara instead of Jade.""
His buddy took a drink.
""Ash, real talk though. Elara might've lied to you, but that girl is head over heels. You can see it every time she looks at you.""
Ashford's jaw tightened.
""Everything I do is for Jade and the kid.
""As for Elara? That's just business.""
His friend smirked. ""If you love Jade so much, just divorce Elara and marry her. Your brother's been dead a year anyway.""
""I'm not divorcing Elara."" He said it fast.
""I'm sending Jade and Sawyer overseas. And when Sawyer's eighteen, he takes over everything.""
""Damn. You act like that kid's actually yours!""
Ashford finished his drink. His face went cold.
""I'm never having kids.
""Whatever Jade has—that's mine.""
Hearing that, everyone in the room started laughing and cheering him on.
I stood outside the door. Frozen.
So that's why.
Every time I went back to the Hayes estate, the entire family—even the staff—treated me like I didn't exist.
Only my mother-in-law would look at me.
But she just asked the same thing every time:
""Are you pregnant yet?""
And I would give her the same answer: No.
So winter after winter, I'd find myself kneeling in the snow.
Ashford would always rush back to save me. He'd frantically rub my frozen fingers, trying to warm them up.
And I'd just smile and nuzzle his jaw. ""I'm not cold. Really.""
Turns out, everyone knew I was a liar all along.
I looked down at the ultrasound report in my hand.
My fingers traced over the tiny dark spot on the paper.
Then slowly, I crumpled it into a ball and tossed it in the trash.
I want a divorce.
Chapter 2
When I booked the abortion appointment, the doctor wouldn't stop asking if I was absolutely sure.
See, my body's different.
If I terminate this pregnancy, I'll probably never get pregnant again.
I tried to answer, but the words got stuck in my throat.
Because the truth is—nobody's ever wanted me. Not really.
When my parents split, Mom took my perfect older sister—the one who knew how to play the game. Dad kept my brother—the one who could carry on the family name.
Grandma was the only one who hugged me tight and told me I mattered.
But then she died.
After that? I was just some forgotten weed growing in the middle of nowhere.
Until Ashford showed up.
He was the first guy who actually looked at me. Really looked.
All those times he picked me—stood by me—I let myself believe that maybe after the wedding, we could start a family.
A little person who was half me, half him.
I wanted to give that baby everything Grandma gave me, everything Ashford gave me. Pour all that love into one tiny soul.
But tonight I finally understood the truth.
He doesn't love me.
He's been playing me this whole time.
I stood there, gripping my phone, trying to figure out what to say to the doctor.
Then it buzzed.
A text.
From Jade—Ashford's sister-in-law.
\[Elara. We need to talk.\]
...
At the coffee shop.
Jade sat across from me, stirring her drink.
""So you're the one pushing Ashford to send me and Sawyer overseas?""
""That wasn't me.""
She laughed and slid a black card across the table.
""Leave him.
""Five million. More than enough for someone like you.""
I pushed it back.
""What, not enough?""
""I don't want money.""
""Okay then. WHAT do you want?"" She actually looked at me this time. ""You think you can take him from me?
""You have no idea how he used to be with me.
Back in college, he'd stand in line for two hours in the freezing cold just to get me coffee.
He'd keep it warm inside his jacket the whole way to my dorm.
I mentioned once that I liked ginkgo trees for my birthday.
Next morning? An entire street of them planted outside my apartment.""
She paused, her smile turning smug.
""But I married his brother anyway.
""The eldest Hayes wife had a better ring to it, you know?""
Her eyes lit up like she was reliving her favorite moment.
""On my wedding day, they said he stood outside the church all night. Got so sick after that he looked like a ghost.
""Now that his brother's dead, I guess everything's falling into place.""
I kept silence. My grip on the cup tightened until my knuckles hurt.
Jade's smile turned nasty.
""Since you won't walk away, let's make this interesting.""
She pulled out her phone. ""We both call him. Right now.
""I'll say our old dog is sick.
""You tell him you're running a 104 fever.
""He shows up for me? You sign the divorce papers.
""He shows up for you? I'm on a plane with Sawyer tomorrow.""
Her eyes dared me.
""What do you say?""
Chapter 3
A thousand thoughts raced through my head as I watched her sitting there, so sure she'd already won.
Then something inside me just snapped.
""Okay. Let's do it.""
Jade smiled. Waved her hand at me. ""You call first. If I go first and he picks up, he'll be halfway here already. Won't even see your call coming through.""
I pulled up his contact. My hands were shaking.
The phone rang. And rang. And rang.
Finally, someone answered.
""Mrs. Hayes?
""Mr. Hayes is in a board meeting. If you need something, I can help.""
Peter. His assistant.
I swallowed hard. ""I'm driving right now, but I think I'm getting a fever. Everything's spinning. Can you please tell Ashford—""
A pause on the other end.
Then:
""Mr. Hayes is closing a major acquisition deal today. He can't leave the room. I'll send a car to take you to urgent care right away.""
Click. He hung up.
I sat there staring at my phone, gripping it so tight my hand hurt.
Seeing that, Jade pulled out her phone, totally calm.
That smirk still on her face.
Her voice dropped to something soft and sweet. ""Hey Ash, I think Coal's sick.""
Then, his voice came through crystal clear. Fast. Urgent.
""Where are you?"" Then immediately: ""Peter, clear my schedule for the rest of the day.""
Jade glanced at me. Feigning concern, she continued.
""If you're busy, you could always just send—""
""I'm not busy.""
He cut her off gently. Then hung up.
At that moment, it felt like someone punched a hole straight through my chest.
Jade's smile got wider. She stared at me.
""You know what? Let's make this even better.
""You can thank me later\~""
Before I could react, she actually snatched my phone and started typing.
I reached for it, but my body wouldn't cooperate.
\[Ash, I was just in a car accident. I'm hurt really bad.\]
She sent it.
Time slowed down after that.
I watched that screen like my life depended on it. Nails digging into my palm.
Five minutes.
Ten.
The screen stayed black. Dead silent.
Jade pushed the card toward me again. ""Game over.""
I stared at that card and suddenly started laughing.
Then the tears came.
I really thought I was so smart. Such a good liar.
Turns out I was just pathetic.
""Yeah. You win.
""Keep your money.
""I'll sign the papers tonight.""
...
Outside the coffee shop, my phone suddenly rang.
Ashford.
I watched his name flashing on the screen.
And for the first time, my heart didn't race.
Declined. Blocked. Done.
Then I opened my email app.
Top of my inbox—the acceptance letter from Slade that came this morning.
The professor said my work showed real talent. Said he couldn't wait to meet me.
Funny thing is—
Two hours after I got that email, I found out I was pregnant.
That's why I freaked out and went looking for Ashford with the ultrasound printout.
I put my hand on my stomach.
Then wrote back:

But seriously, jokes aside, it does seem like I'm going for MRIs and MRAs way too often. It does seem like I'm a little bit of a hypochondriac here.



I went to a neurologist a few weeks ago. Obviously, just two years ago, and the year before that, it seems like I'm constantly getting MRIs.



The reason we're getting it this time is because I said, ""when I... speaking medically... ejaculated, I felt a sharp pain in the vascular region of my brain."" So, I'm afraid of brain cancer. I'm afraid of an aneurysm. I'm afraid of neurological damage.



Somebody jokes, when you get the MRI, we're going to discover there's no brain in there. You're a pudding head, a vegetable mind.



Okay, jokes aside here, I'm reconsidering and in fact I kind of don't want to get the MRI and MRA, but also, I'm afraid and kind of want to get it to rule out anything. 



Can too many MRIs and MRAs cause brain cancer? If you get an MRI and MRA constantly... can that cause any issues?



Also, I asked my inpatients and everyone, I'm scheduled for it this week, would you go would you go through with it? Or would you cancel all future appointments at the neurologist and the MRI and MRA?



They said, ""well, you took a mega regimen of psychiatric medications from 2011/2012 - November 2022. I know they say the medications do not cause brain cancer, but I'm skeptical. And they say you drink a lot of coffee, you sit in solitude, you get a lot of stress headaches and migraines."" They say, ""I would go for the MRI and MRA. Maybe don't repeat it yearly, but I would go.""



Fair enough. 



What are your thoughts? What's your take? 



I'm scheduled, before the end of the year to get an MRI, an MRA. I feel like I'm doing it constantly and I'm a hypochondriac. Would you go through with it or do you think you would cancel?",1,1766923604.0,AndrewKoloski,0,1.0,False

 **Memory Transcription: Edward Wanless, Captain of ARK 14 “Seguin” {REDACTED}** 

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: December 25, 2136*

*Sixty-nine days after the Battle of Earth.*

The man in the mirror pulls at his collar in discomfort, his old face twisting into a frown as he fights the fabric. With a faint growl, he releases the cloth, rolling his shoulders in an effort to make the foreign garment sit comfortably. It's a white dress shirt, the kind meant to be worn under a coat. ~~Like hell I’ll wear that damn coat.~~ A largely simple design, a string of shining brass buttons run up the placket, and a pocket clings to the left side of the chest, decorated with a splash of color. A map of Earth nestled between two olive branches, embroidered in glossy blue thread.

~~Because the U.N. had to put its brand on everything.~~ 

Breathing deeply, he runs a hand over his head of graying orange hair, an act of idle preening. 

*Delaying the inevitable, I’ve already made up my mind.* 

With a huff, I push off from the sink, slowly backing away from the mirror to get a better look at myself. A white dress shirt tucked into a pair of dark blue pleated trousers and affixed in place by a black canvas belt with a matching brass buckle, all of it wrinkle-free and *pristine.* A little on the formal side perhaps, but first impressions were important, and this one has been a long time coming.

Deciding that I look as good as I can, I raise my hands, taking the last button in my trembling fingers. ~~Shaking from more than just age now.~~ The metal sealing together with a barely audible snap that seemed to echo through the small washroom. It was final, a declaration of purpose. Clenching my fists, I exit into my quarters, the washroom going dark behind me.

Crossing the room, I stop at the foot of my bed; the rest of the captain’s uniform lies in a heap there. The uniform jacket, bereft of its dress shirt and matching trousers, lies open like a discarded wrapper. Its meaningless pins and medals gleaming in the white light of the gargoyle lamps, while its inner layer of smooth silk glitters like unblemished snow. The peaked cap is out of sight but nearby, having been left within the storage compartment. Both close, both inviting. An invitation I have no plans on accepting.

*The shirt already felt heavier than it should.* 

 Ignoring the empty jacket, I snatch my personal pad from its resting place on the sheets. A quick prod rouses the device, its bright screen displaying the time. It was late, not that the time of day really mattered all too much anymore. With the Seguin’s perpetual light and constant temperature, “night” and “day” had blended together seamlessly. 

*It’s almost midnight, most of them should have cleared out by now.* 

Stowing the device, I stride out of the room before I can change my mind. The walk to the elevator is quiet and uninterrupted; the majority of the crew are either already at my destination or, more likely, sleeping off the festivities. With a trembling finger I enter my destination into the control panel, the passenger compartment.

The steady whirring of the cables filters in from above as I pace back and forth in front of the sealed door. My eyes fixed firmly on my hands as I attempt to wring the nervous tremors from them. With nothing to occupy me during the descent, the building dread in my chest takes my full attention. 

Why am I doing this? I shouldn’t be anywhere near those people; they likely wouldn’t even want me. Who *would* want their kidnapper to attend their Christmas party, regardless of when he got there? Besides, it's not like I wasn’t used to spending the holiday alone; the last thirty-four years could attest to that. I really should just stop the elevator, go back to my quarters, and let those people enjoy their moment of relative normality. 

Yet I don’t press that button; it would be so easy to reverse course, and I just… can’t.

*Why?*

Thirty-four years spent in a concrete box, my only human contact was the brief time it took for the guard to slip my tray under the door. I was used to being alone; I was used to letting my day bleed into the next. So why did I feel this overpowering desire to attend, even as the idea of doing so terrified me so much that it made me shake?  

Was I that lonely, or was it because for the first time in half of my life I had the choice again? Choice… I would hardly call myself a free man, but I was out, out of *that* cell at least. 

*I was out…*

The elevator buzzer sounds, the noise making the dread in my chest flare, like gasoline to fire. Taking one last deep breath, I set my jaw and pass between the sliding doors. 

It was the first time I had set foot in the passenger compartment; fortunately, it was almost a straight shot to the meeting area from the elevator. The corridors were deserted, just as I had hoped, having made my decision to arrive when most of the passengers would already be at the meeting area, or better yet, having returned to their bunks. I did want to see them, to know them, but so many people all at once? I just couldn’t…

*Coward*. 

My first clue that I’m close is the noise; music flits down the hall, its frail voice barely audible over the hum of the lights but rapidly growing in strength. One of the passengers must have brought a portable speaker with them, I certainly didn’t give Turner and Clairby access to the compartment’s intercoms. Turning a corner, my heart leaps up my throat. 

Someone is coming down the corridor.

It's a man, one that I don’t recognize, so he’s most certainly a passenger. He walks with open weariness, his well-worn sneakers squeaking as they drag over the smooth floor. He holds a drink in his left hand, while his right reaches out, fingertips tracing the wall as he walks. His pace slows as I pass by; watery brown eyes peer out at me through a face made old before its time. I quicken my pace, biting the inside of my cheek as I keep my gaze locked on the corridor before me. I hear him pause behind me, but only for a moment, the squeaking of rubber against steel fading into the growing tenor of the party at the end of the corridor.

A gasp tears its way through my mouth as my hand goes to my chest, feeling the frantic fluttering of my heart. Looking down the hall, I can see the open door leading into the dining hall where the celebration is taking place. Too close to turn back now, I breathe deeply, willing the frantic metronome in my chest to calm down. My entry into the large green and blue room goes largely unnoticed, the few people looking towards the door sparing me a brief glance but nothing more.

For a moment I stand in the doorway, my eyes drinking in the scene in front of me. The space is largely how Turner’s plans had described, either side of the door is flanked by a long table, one offering drinks and the other food. The familiar scent of coffee wafts from my right, one of several offerings tonight, alongside teas, juices, and soft drinks. 

*Our irreplaceables, spent well.* 

The table to my left holds food, nothing that would offend a Venlil’s sensibilities, however. The human serving table would be out of sight nearby; the original plan had been to extend an invitation to the wider flotilla. That was before Clairby’s encounter with the exterminators, however.

Technically the offer was still given, but after the incident, Vilka and her officers felt it would be unwise to leave the Shield, and I wasn’t willing to risk exterminators getting onboard, so that’s where it stopped. As for the aliens already on the Seguin, I’m pleasantly surprised by the presence of a small “herd” of Venlil. Four of them sit together in the corner of the room, their plates still full. 

*Had the same idea as me, maybe?* 

Kleasi and Steni are here as well, sitting with Daniel in front of our Christmas “tree”. Kleasi kneels behind them, her ears panning back and forth like satellite dishes. The two children sit side by side, leaning against each other for support as they watch the lights bounce off the tin ornaments. 

Our “tree” was a twisted stand of carbon brushes, welded into shape by Martinez and her engineers. Its black “branches” speckled with pinpricks of flickering green and red light and heavily laden with polished tin stars and crosses. A steel facsimile of what was, cold and brutalistic yet also contradictorily warm and nostalgic. That tree was the highest expense in Turner’s plan, but one we could afford. 

*Have to have a tree for Christmas.* 

Satisfied with my survey, I help myself at the serving tables before sitting at the end of the nearest table. My choices were relatively modest save for a generous helping of coffee. No meat yet; I’d search for that after my nerves had calmed a bit. Relatively speaking, there weren’t that many people still here, a little over one hundred maybe. Enough that my arrival went unacknowledged but not so many that I could pass through them unnoticed. 

A plate clatters onto the table to my left. “Excuse me, Captain, do you mind if I sit here?”

I turn, finding Elena, her face split by a broad smile. 

“By all means.” I reply, feeling my own lips start to curl.

“Thank you, sir.” She says, settling in beside me.

I nod before turning my attention back to my own plate. It’s nice eating with someone again; even though we aren’t speaking, the silence isn’t unpleasant. A quiet moment after the constant activity of the past few days…  

*You still haven’t spoken with her about your little “episode.”* A venomous voice whispers in the back of my mind. 

My breath hitches, our initial encounter with the Venlil. Has it really only been nine days? 

I had meant to speak with her about it but the constant activity, the excitement. First the new rescues, then negotiating with Vilka, and now Christmas. It had all just gotten away from me, there hadn’t been time to speak with her.

*Plenty of time now.* 

No, absolutely not. I would address… *that*, I would, but this wasn’t the place, and now certainly wasn’t the time. There’ll be a chance in the next day or two, surely; I’ll do it then.

*You’ll do it here and now, or you’ll try to hide from it again.*

I’ve stopped eating now, the plastic fork hanging from my fingers. I glance sideways at Elena; she’s relaxed, humming to herself as she nurses a cup of hot tea. 

*You’re going to get her killed, you know.* 

No, I…

*The only reason you were let out was so the U.N. could keep one more body between Kalsim and Earth. Selfish old man, scared to lose a position that should have never been given to you in the first place. You should have died in that concrete box; better yet, you should have taken the needle like the re…*

I drop the fork onto the plate, my hand slipping back into my lap. Unconsciously it grasps onto the blue trousers, gripping the fabric with white-knuckle intensity. I turn to face Elena, my voice coming out more broken than I had intended.

“We need to talk.”

**Memory Transcription: Elena Herrera, First Mate of ARK 14 “Seguin”** 

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: December 25, 2136* 

*Sixty-nine days after the Battle of Earth.*

“We need to talk.”

*Something’s wrong.*

I turn; the captain’s demeanor has changed completely. The smile he had worn openly mere minutes ago is gone, replaced by a grimace. An expression somewhere between guilt and fear, and his tone… 

“A-about what, sir?” 

He’s quiet for a moment, his eyes flicking from me to the floor and back again. Can’t maintain eye contact? 

*Have* ***I*** *done something?*

“When we first encountered the Venlil.” His voice is uneven, uncertain. 

My heart sinks. *He means to reprimand me.* 

I knew this would be coming, of course, undermining his authority like that, in front of the entire bridge crew, no less. If anything, it was a miracle that it was this long coming; under normal circumstances, the disciplinary action would have been immediate once the threat was resolved. 

On the bright side, he wasn’t likely to have me dismissed or court-martialed, our current circumstances being what they are. A firm warning or a dressing down, and a shorter leash going forward. Not bad considering my actions bordered on mutiny, but why now though? A Christmas party was hardly the place, or was that the intention? Keeping this off the clock and off the books?

I nod, giving the captain my full attention and steeling myself for what is to come. 

“I shouldn’t… I’m not…” The old man drags a hand down his face before speaking again, his voice tight. “When I froze…”

*Oh.*

“We don’t need to discuss that, sir.” I say the words, leaving my mouth before I can properly think them over.

“No, I think we do.” He returns firmly, fortunately not bothered by my tone. “My little “episode” could have cost the lives of everyone on this ship. We got lucky, yes but… It’s been clearly proven that I’m unfit to lead, and for that reason. I’m surrendering the command of the Seguin to you.”

*What?!*

“Sir, you don’t have the authority to make that decision.” I stammer. “Besides I’m not qualified fo-”

Wanless scoffs, shaking his head dismissively. “Authority? Elena, there is no higher “authority” anymore, you’re a perfectly capable young woman, and I nearly got everyone killed. You took command when I failed, and you led well. It seems a clear decision to me.”

A clear decision? Did he really think that little of his command over the last two months? Taking in the new rescues, negotiating our alliance with the Venlil’s fleet, and approving Turner’s harebrained scheme to bring a little bit of normality back to our lives—that wasn’t nothing.

 Daniel’s faint voice drifts over our table, a child that would have died had the captain not trusted the aliens, that would still be lost in his grief if the old man hadn’t done everything to accommodate his new caregiver.

Several pieces of multimillion-dollar equipment were disassembled to make lights, for no other reason than “the people deserved a holiday”. Sure he’d only approved the plan, but would any of the other officers have done the same? Would I have done the same if I were in his position? Another sound drifts past us, triggering my translator. It's Kleasi, the old ven beginning to usher her charges back to their quarters for the night.

*Would I have allowed the Venlil to join us?*

~~No.~~

“Permission to speak freely, sir?” 

The old man sighs. “Of course.” 

“I refuse.” I answer firmly.

“I-No.” The old man sputters. “You can’t refuse; you saw what happened I-”

“You froze, sir, so did everyone else on the bridge.” I answer plainly. 

“You didn’t.” He presses, fighting to keep his voice low. 

“I froze on The Cradle when we were actually getting shot at.” I say, shrugging my shoulders. “People who are far more “prepared” than you still freeze in those circumstances. It's natural; you recovered quickly. I think you’re right where you need to be.”

A heavy breath leaves the captain as his shoulders slump; raising a limp hand, he pushes the plate away from himself. Making room for his arms as he buries his face in his palms. A pang of sympathy pierces my heart as I shuffle closer to the old man.

*Why is he so uncharitable to himself?*

“How… How can you think that?” He asks, his muffled voice slipping between his fingers.

“It’s not just me that feels that way, you know. Rivera, Turner, the rest of the bridge crew, and the passengers, you made quite the impression. We’ve all been together for over two months now; we know you sir, and we trust you.”

“You don’t know the first thing about me.” He replies bitterly.

*Hmm, there’s something more there, but now isn’t the time.*

*Help the captain.*

“We know that you’re the type of man who leaps at the chance to save human lives, the type to do everything in his power to reunite a child with people that care about him, the kind of man that can turn a single ship into a fleet of forty-five.” I say, feeling the faint tug of a smile at the corners of my mouth.

The captain pulls his face from his hands. “I’m not military.” He says it like he’s revealing a secret.

“Our mission isn’t to establish a military base.” I reply. “Now maintaining crew discipline and keeping morale high is still vital, of course, but them?” I indicate the gathering of passengers at the end of the room. “They don’t need a military man.”

*Another reason why a leadership change is not viable right now.* 

“If I have another episode-” 

“Then I’ll step in like I did before, with your permission, of course.” I say, cutting him off.

*Really getting the most out of that free speech permission.*

The captain’s weary eyes meet mine, holding the gaze for a moment before softening. Accepting that I won’t relent, he sighs, raising a shaking hand to massage his brow.

“You shouldn’t have to coddle an old fool.”

“There’s a lot **we** shouldn’t have to do.” I answer, letting my own gaze soften. “It’s wrong, it’s unfair, but it’s where we are.” 

The captain’s eyes leave me, passing first over the small group of Venlil, then settling on the large group of passengers behind me. 

“They would like to meet you, you know?” 

“Would they?” He asks, his voice thick with uncertainty. “After the part I played in separating them?” 

“They don’t blame **you,** captain. If they weren’t here… They’d be dead, and even on its worst days the Seguin beats death.” 

“I… Yes, let's go.*”* The captain says. “*Before I change my mind*”

I nod, choosing to ignore the last remark he slipped under his breath. Rising from the table, we make our way to the largest gathering of people; the crowd had thinned substantially from the party’s beginning. The dining hall was one of the largest rooms in the civilian compartment, but it wasn’t made to accommodate so many people at once; in the early hours the festivities had spilled into the surrounding corridors and beyond.

*A smaller crowd was likely much better for the captain’s nerves.*

Spying Turner at the edge of the crowd, I choose him as our point of entry into the wider group. The man is swaying on his feet; if the Seguin had any alcohol onboard, I’d assume he was drunk, but he was likely just exhausted. He has his arm wrapped around the shoulder of another peacekeeper, leaning on the man for support. Our presence goes unnoticed until I clear my throat, the lieutenant lazily bringing his head around to face the noise.

For a moment his half-lidded eyes simply stare at us uncomprehendingly before a spark of recognition flashes within them. Eyes going wide, Turner quickly untangles himself from his support, accidentally striking himself in the forehead with his salute. 

“Captain Wanless! I’m sorry, sir; I didn’t recognize you.” 

Turner’s announcement brings silence to the gathering, as the few peacekeepers in the crowd follow their lieutenant's example while the passengers simply stare in open interest.

I shoot a sideways glance at the captain; he’s stiff as a board, his eyes firmly locked onto the gathering in front of him. The quiet stretches for several moments before a woman separates from the crowd, stepping forward to meet the old man.

“Captain?” She asks, her tone heavy with concern.

The words break Wanless out of his deadlock. “Oh! I- At ease, men! Terribly sorry, I seem to have drifted off for a moment.” He punctuates his words with a stilted laugh.

A knowing look crosses the woman’s face as she regards the old man.

“Would you like to join us?” She suggests.

The captain pauses, his jaw working behind his closed lips, almost as if he’s chewing the words before he speaks.

“If you’ll have me.” He answers, his voice almost a whisper.  

A crooked smile splits her face; reaching out, she takes the captain’s hand in her own.

“We’d love to.” 

**Memory Transcription: Kleasi, Venlil Survivor.**

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: December 25, 2136* 

*Sixty-nine days after the Battle of Earth.*

*This has been the single most frightening paw of my life.* 

It shouldn’t have been; of course the humans weren’t going to harm me or Steni. Daniel certainly hadn’t been aggressive towards us, beyond what was expected from a grieving pup, nor had any of the other survivors in the Shield’s medical ward. If we were safe around sick predators, then it was only logical that we would be equally safe around those that were healthier and of a more sound state of mind. Yet…

*The eyes.*

I was used to Daniel, I was; I barely even flinched around him anymore. But other humans? I knew they couldn’t help it, but they made my wool itch; even now, almost half a claw later, I could still see them. Those penetrating eyes still plagued my vision, even behind closed eyelids, making my wool stand on end and denying me any sleep… and the *meat.*

They’d tried for the most part to keep it out of sight, and I appreciated that, but just knowing it was there was more than enough to fray my nerves. ~~You’re in a predator den; of course they’ll be eating flesh.~~ My revulsion is tempered, however, by the revelation the vessel’s elder had shared with me during our call. Humans **could** survive on a diet of plants, but not the same diet we consumed. 

*How much of Daniel’s condition was the result of our ignorance?*

~~The bleeding, the bruises, the wounds that would never close.~~ 

Dr. Rivera wouldn’t tell me when I asked, likely to spare me the guilt. But I knew, her refusal was a clear enough answer. 

~~You were killing him.~~ 

He still asked for us though, *both* of us. Steni I could understand; they were both pups, and they’d gotten along well before he became ill. She was blameless in what had happened. But *me*? Surely their doctors had explained his condition to him; he was still young, but he had to understand how I was partially to blame. How I was hurting him…

Steni stirs, her little paws wrapping tighter around my tail with a contented sigh. It was strange to say, but I was jealous of my granddaughter; she was nervous around the humans but not *scared* like I was. She didn’t flinch when Daniel turned his head too fast or when he spoke too loudly. Before Kalsim came for Venlil Prime, I would have been concerned by her lack of fear. In our current circumstances, however, it was a blessing. 

I angle my ears so that I can hear my precious pup better; she purrs faintly in her sleep. The quiet rumble soothing my frayed nerves, but I hear something else over her. Sniffling? Careful not to wake Steni I roll to my left, turning my ears to the side of the closet where Daniel had laid his bedding.

It's a sound I knew all too well, first from the pupcare and then from raising Steni. The quiet crying of a pup that’s trying not to be heard.

*Help the pup.*

“Daniel, are you alright?” I whisper, my eyes straining to make use of the small amount of light that seeps under the door. 

His head snaps to me, making my wool stand on end. He stays like that for a moment, a dark shape in the corner of the room. Unmoving, watching…

~~PREDAT-~~

*Stop it; he’s just a pup.*

“I know you’re awake; come here. What’s wrong?” I whisper, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. 

I carefully pull my tail from Steni’s grip as I rise to a sitting position. I retrieve my pad from its resting place, turning it so that the screen light illuminates Daniel’s path to me. He slowly rises from the blankets, his movements slow and stiff, never looking directly at me. 

*Forcing himself to change to not scare me.* 

He closes the distance with carefully measured steps, stopping just out of reach. Looking straight down, hiding his eyes from me.

“Daniel, please look at me.” I plead.

A moment of hesitation passes before he does as I ask, slowly and nervously raising his head. 

The pad light glints off two thin streams of moisture that continue to flow from the corners of his eyes, now red and puffy from crying; his lip trembles despite him clearly attempting to put on a brave face, and the hem of his nightpelt is thoroughly soaked. He must have been crying for a while; the realization makes my heart break. 

“I-I’m s-s-sorry I woke you u-up, Ms. K-Kleasi. I d-didn’t mea-”

I don’t give him the chance to finish, driven by an instinct even more powerful than fear I rise quickly, pulling the pup into an embrace. Gently shushing him as my paws make small circles on his back, feeling the frantic hammer of his little heart even through the pelt. The next few moments pass in silence as I wait for his breathing to even out, running through the same practiced motions I’ve used on Steni and countless other pups before.

“Why didn’t you wake me?” I ask.

“I t-thought that if-f I sc-scared you a-again, then you’d l-l-leave m-me.” He answers through the last lingering hiccups. 

~~You’re making him hurt again.~~  

“No, you don’t worry about scaring me. It’s not **your** fault; I need to change, not you.” I answer firmly. 

*I have to put my paw down on this self-destructive behavior before it causes any lasting harm.* 

Having calmed him down, I gently guide him to sit at the edge of the bedding.

“Now do you want to tell me what’s wrong?” 

“I had a nightmare about when everyone was running, and I fell down…”

*The stampede.* I’d pulled Daniel up then and held onto him until we had reached the Evergreen. All without realizing who I had grabbed until we were already on the ship.

~~Would you have saved him then if you knew what he was?~~

I squeeze his “hand” in sympathy. I’ve seen stampede dreams many times in my life, first at the pupcare, then with Steni after her mother had passed. Nightmares of that paw had plagued her for cycles; luckily, I knew how to treat them. I pat the open space next to Steni.

“Do you want to sleep here tonight?” I ask. “I know a secret for keeping bad dreams away.” 

“Are you sure?” He answers timidly.

“I’m positive. It’ll help, I promise; everyone knows bad dreams stay away from herds.” 

Thankfully the pup doesn’t need further convincing, eagerly taking the space I offered. Almost immediately Steni rolls in her sleep, throwing a tiny arm over his shoulders and holding on tightly.

*Precious pups.*

Flicking my ears in satisfaction, I lay down on my side, not my preferred position, but I had to make sure the pups had enough room. No longer in use, the pad light winks out, plunging us back into darkness.

~~In the dark with a predato-~~

*STOP.*

A few scratches pass, though I can tell from experience that Daniel still isn’t asleep yet. His breathing not yet falling into that deep peaceful rhythm.

“I miss my mom and dad.” 

The words are barely even a whisper, yet carry so much heartbreak with them. They pass into the dark, not having truly been meant for anyone. A child’s expression of grief. Another I was familiar with, but exposure didn’t make it hurt any less to hear. Reaching out, I brush the hair from his face with my knuckles.

*Had to be mindful of the claws.* 

“I’m sorry, sweet fruit; I can’t imagine.” I whisper back.

“How far away is Venlil Prime?”

“Really far.” 

“Oh…” His voice falls in disappointment. “Do you think they’ll let me go look for them?”

“I’m sorry, sweet fruit, but you can’t, not until we find a safe place to stay first.” I hate lying to pups, but sometimes it’s necessary.

 Daniel sniffles, prompting me to shuffle closer to him.

*Please don’t cry again.*

“Do people want to hurt me because I’m bad?” 

I flinch at the question. Who in Solgalick’s name would tell **any** pup such a thing? A heat builds in my chest as the familiar protective drive takes control. I move even closer, my chin coming to rest above Daniel’s head, as my arm reaches over him and Steni, safely securing both pups.

~~Easy access to your throat.~~

*SHUT UP!* 

Those kinds of thoughts were wrong; no pup naturally asked questions like that. Someone, somewhere, had planted that seed.

“Who told you that?” I demand.

“Other Venlil, before we came here.” He answers timidly. 

*Brahkasses.*

“Daniel, there is **nothing** wrong with you.” I answer firmly, squeezing the two of them tighter. “I’m not going to let anything happen to either of you, ok?” 

Daniel doesn’t answer, but I feel him nod beneath my chin. Beside him Steni stirs again, twisting in her sleep as her arm reaches further around the human. Another faint purr rolling from her chest.

*Precious pups…*

 **Memory Transcription: Steni, Eavesdropping Venlil Pup**

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: December 25, 2136* 

*Sixty-nine days after the Battle of Earth.*

I had to be sneaky with how I moved; Gram always got upset when I listened in on other people's conversations. She said it was bad herd behavior, but it wasn’t my fault this time! Daniel was so loud, even when he was “whispering”.

*It makes sense; humans have such small ears they probably have to be loud to hear each other.* 

But human ears aren't important right now. It was a good thing I had listened in; what Daniel had said made me really, really **mad**! 

Sure, humans were a little scary, but it wasn’t the bad kind of scary; they were scary like Mazics or Letians were! Daniel was also the **least** scary human I’d met so far; he was nice, gentle, and fun to play with! The adults had no reason to be so mean to him. Being mean was bad herd behavior too, and he was already sad! So they should just not say anything if they can’t be nice.

I fidget trying to find a way to get my other arm out from underneath me so I can hug Daniel with both, but Gram’s holding us both pretty tight, so there’s no way I can do that without giving away that I’m awake. Oh well, I’ll just have to make do with the one.

*Hugs always make me feel better when I miss my parents.* 

I was sad like Daniel for a really long time. Gram once told me that being sad wasn’t always bad, and I think I understand what she meant now. I knew how Daniel was feeling, so I could help! I shift slightly, trying to get my arm around Daniel even tighter, remembering something else that I overheard Gram say one time. Something about holding onto someone so they don’t fall apart.

*Don’t worry, Daniel, I’m holding on. I won’t let you fall apart.*

As the tittle suggests I am at the point where I'm looking to upgrade from my Mazda 3 to a Skoda (with a bigger boot) that allows more storage for family trips, as well as when we have children, we can put strollers + all the other things there as well.

I am looking to buy a brand **new** car. Considering the budget I set (35-36k €) I can get either:

\- a properly equipped Skoda Octavia Combi Family 

\-or a also nicely equiped Skoda Enyaq with a 85 battery (with a VAT return + government subsidy)

I was also looking at the Superb but I believe the Octavia is good enough for what I need.

I am the type of person who wants to buy a new car and use it 10+ years. I am not one of those people who changes their car every 2,3,4,5 years... For instance I've had my current car for 16 years since I bought it new all the way back in 2009.

I mostly have daily drives around town and for work (10-50km) and quite some work related drives (up to 200-250km). A couple of times a year (3-4 times) I go for longer drives (going to the seaside, longer business trips etc...) that can be 500+km. On a yearls basis I do around 20-23k. 

On one hand I'm really leaning into the Enyaq. Getting a beast of a car for that price tag is insane, but the questions regarding battery degredation after let's say 6-8 years makes me unsure. I live in the southern part of central Europe so coverage with charging stations isn't that big of an issue. It does make me wonder though, what the car is going to offer after 10 years. The warranty on the battery is 8 years for instance.

On the other hand the Octavia is a tried and tested classic, which would definitely be my go-to if it wasn't for the Enyaq offer.

The Karoq/Elroq have a boot which is just a bit too small for what I'm looking at so I've threw them off my list.

I'd love to hear everyone's experiences and thoughts! Is the Enyaq a no brainer and when we go for those (few) longer drives we just make some pit-stops (which would probably make anyway in order to strech our legs and get a coffee) in order to recharge? Any other things that need to be considered?

1pxpm6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/1pxpm6i/leep_conization_uneventful/,LEEP Conization: Uneventful,"I had CIN 2 and a LEEP conization, and I wanted to share my case. I’m Spanish, but I moved to Paris a few months ago, and I have to say that *conisation* in French sounds much better than it does in Spanish.

It all started the day I decided it was time to stop postponing my Pap smears and went to the gynecologist a friend recommended. Seven years. Seven. Since the last one. I was seen by a very sweet woman who made the whole process easy and bearable.

I should say that I’m a total coward. Everything has always terrified me: needles, anxiolytics, lasers, reassuring smiles… basically everything.  
When I was little, and my grandmother told me she’d had breast surgery, I thought life handed out ordeals according to people’s capacities, and that it was impossible for something like that to happen to me, because I just wouldn’t survive it.

But little by little, life goes by, and you realize you’re not so unique that a small needle is going to do something different to you than it does to anyone else. It’s not going to break inside. A vein isn’t going to explode. The needle will treat you exactly the same as everyone else.

So once again, probably for the fifth time or so in my life, I went to get a Pap smear. I went terrified, of course. Then I got scared when they asked for a colposcopy and thought: *seven years, Carolina, you’re an idiot.* And I got scared again when they told me I had CIN 2.

For once, the internet was comforting. It was like the best prognosis TV commercial: success rates, optimistic percentages, and the explicit promise that pain was something that belonged to other diseases. I had the best precancer you could have.

It reassured me so much that I thought I’d find even more certainty by reading real stories, so I went on Reddit. And that’s why I’m writing this here today. If everything up to that point was being managed quite well, suddenly Reddit kept me awake for three nights in a row. The stories were of the “worst experience of my life” kind, and up from there.

It’s okay. It’s not a lie. But it’s the truth of one among millions. Some women have the worst experience of their lives during a Pap smear. And if you’re one of them, ask for general anesthesia. I’m afraid of Pap smears, but when it comes down to it, the speculum bothers me a bit and I barely notice the rest.

In this process I learned that when the brain doesn’t have comparative data, it makes it up. Like AI.  
And when they open you, scrape you, or cut you in there, even if it doesn’t hurt, the brain panics and protests: *hey, what is this, take it out, this shouldn’t be happening*. It’s not always pain; sometimes it’s just an alarm.

I’m not saying it doesn’t hurt. For many women it does, even though none of these things hurt me. They only bothered me a little.  
But of course, they’re going into the most intimate and precious place, the one you only let chosen people into after a rigorous selection process (with standards that fluctuate depending on weather, season and moment of your menstrual cycle), but which is yours in any case. The brain protects that, and in these situations it gets a bit overly dramatic.

And we don’t all start from the same place. Many women have lived through assaults. And the brain remembers. Someone touches you there without permission, outside the context of pleasure, and the body responds with terror. There is no exaggeration there. The pain is real.  
It doesn’t have to be your case. It wasn’t mine.

I read all those stories and had to consciously repeat something simple to myself: people who write on Reddit usually do so because they had a bad experience, not to say that nothing happened.

So I wanted to write this. Yes it was: uneventful.

And yes, even though I was terrified, I must have done a good job during the colposcopy, because the doctor called me and recommended removing the damaged area under local anesthesia. When you’ve swallowed so many panic attacks that your friends would say that over those beers “Caro had a great time,” you develop an outstanding ability to behave. I also probably did well not to look bad in front of her.

I wasn’t thrilled about general anesthesia, so after a lot of research I convinced myself it wouldn’t be a big deal. That, on a sensory level, the colposcopy had been almost more uncomfortable. That I’d go ahead with local anesthesia, the LEEP, and whatever was needed. 

And it was true. It was nothing.

I woke up at 5:30 a.m. My girlfriend brought me a peeled mandarin in bed, and seeing her smiling face felt good. Honestly, eating a mandarin in the darkness at that hour is a bit surreal. I showered and we went out the door.

I had anticipated, as a many-times-awarded expert in the art of anticipation, that I would suffer tremendously on the metro on the way to the hospital. But it wasn’t true. It wasn’t like that while waiting to be called, nor even when they put me on the gurney and took me in an elevator where they had painted a blue sky with clouds. I suppose the intention was to inspire peace and distract from the hospital, but I don’t think there’s anything that reminds you more clearly that you’re in one than a fake sky.

They left me waiting outside the operating room door, where I spent about twenty minutes covered with a NASA-style thermal blanket. I wasn’t scared, but I was starting to feel a bit nervous. Other women arrived and were placed near me. I almost wished they’d lined us up; at that hour the body has the muscle memory of going into an after-party. It would have been a good joke to break the ice. I wondered whether I would have dared to say something if I had been in Spain, or if I would have felt a bit more comfortable in French. No one is okay there. I think a few words from a colleague whose most intimate organ is about to be severed would be appreciated. I would have liked to say something like: “I’m weird right now too, but we’ve got this, it’ll be over in no time”. I didn’t say anything. I don’t think I even said hi. Being spoken to in French scares me too.

I think that’s when I dissociated a little.

I had a kind of inner illumination in which I realized that worrying about things made no sense because nothing is in your control and the only thing that truly belongs to you is inhabiting the present moment. This, which is the most overused and repeated thing in the universe, I swear that at that moment, with my surgical cap and my trembling cervix, I understood it completely. All the calm in the world concentrated there, in that hallway. It caressed my hands and rested on my cheeks. I surrendered to the absolute acceptance of that instant. A functional nihilism, an ataraxia, something almost laughable but that I took very seriously right then.

Then I figured it was probably quite an elegant dissociation to protect me. Kudos to my defense mechanisms.

They took me into the operating room and that composure unraveled a bit, I won’t lie. An operating room is intimidating. There were maybe five or six people there, each dealing with something I will never understand. There’s a bed with leg supports, and unlike the gynecology office, here they strap your legs. There’s one of those huge lights pointing straight down at you… The doctor came over to me; to this day, she is the best person I know. If I believed in anything above the human in this life, I’d believe in her. I wouldn’t rule out starting to pray from now on, and praying to her.

“I know this is much uglier than my office and a bit scarier. Especially this ceiling.”

I nodded with one of those smiles that, if you don’t make a small effort, falls right off your face. ""Merci beaucoup"".

And then there was the other person I would tear my clothes for. The Guardian Angel nurse. A woman in her late fifties who stuck close to my face and told me she would be there during the whole procedure.

I didn’t know this role existed, but this person did exactly that: talk to me and protect me from my escalating mind.

“Now you’ll feel the anesthetic. Look, we count: one, two, three, four… a little pinch. One, two, three, four… another.”

That is exactly how long the discomfort from the anesthesia lasted. It feels like what you imagine. And it lasts so little that you don’t even have time to complain. I waited five minutes, though I now remember it as one. The Guardian Angel moved away for three seconds to grab something and, honestly, I was about to shout at her to come back.

“And now we go with the tool.”

Here I got a bit more scared, because THE TOOL. I think she said something in French like *l’outil*, but she could have said *la Concorde* and I would have understood perfectly what she meant. To this day I haven’t looked up what the tool looks like. Maybe that would be scarier. In case I ever need another conization in the future, I don’t want to know what they put in there.

I kept the logic in my head, but my brain was screaming: *WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOWING THEM TO DO THERE!?*

The nurse, as if hearing this, said: “nothing, nothing, just a few seconds"". And they removed it.

For me it lasted ten seconds, maybe a bit more. I felt pressure and a little discomfort, not pain. The brain may try to tell you that yes, it’s pain. It’s not true. But in those moments the brain turns into a dramatic actress straight out of a Molière play.

They put in another tool to cauterize and that was it. A similar sensation, even milder.

“It’s over,” said the Guardian Angel.

I couldn’t stop repeating ""merci, merci"" and ""vous êtes très gentilles"" to everyone. That sentence I learned in the first weeks after arriving in Paris, and which I don’t think I’ll ever say again with so much feeling.

It was over. It was nothing. And it was true. It was true that I would say: it was nothing.

I left thinking about all the stories I’d read and how almost no one writes when everything goes normally. I laughed at that sky with painted clouds in the elevator. I had a coffee. I went home by metro.

I still don’t know whether the margins are positive or not. That is, whether what they removed was completely clean. Hopefully yes. And if not, then whatever needs to be done will be done; there’s no other choice.

If this happened to you, I know, it sucks. I repeat two things to myself. The first: it’s one of the least terrible diseases there is. The second: you’re not special. Diseases, like needles, are democratic. And sometimes, it’s true, nothing happens.",1,1766922798.0,HPV,0,1.0,False

He and my parents traveled out of state to visit me and my family for the holidays. During dinner, my brother made harmless commentary how my other older sibling did not give him cash for Christmas. He seemed a bit rude and entitled when he made that comment. I was taken aback by his behavior and reminded him the culture of hongbao blessing also requires him to give back to the younger generation (such as my older sibling and my own young children) since he has a full time job now.

When we exchanged Christmas gifts, we gifted everyone a bit of something thoughtful along with cash. Me being the filial child, I made sure everyone got the same amount of money. I wanted to make sure my younger sibling understands that it’s important to pass on hongbao blessing to our parents and to each other (basically learn to give hongbao to your nieces and nephews, too). He wasn’t thrilled when I said this.

I understand when someone starts off a new job and life, money is tight. But his spending is excessive and it grinds my gear that on one hand he complains that he’s broke and is entitled to our hongbaos, while on the other hand keeps spending on things such as vapes, bobas / iced coffees, etc. 

Over the years, I’ve tried hard to teach him the value of money and investing. There’s only so much I can do with teaching how to budget, invest, and gift via blessing.

Moving forward, instead of giving him generous cash gifts during Chinese New Year, birthdays and holidays… should I dial back on the amount? Should I focus on gifting him things instead? Or more importantly what’s the lesson I can teach that maintains the culture of blessings?

I should say that I’m a total coward. Everything has always terrified me: needles, anxiolytics, lasers, reassuring smiles… basically everything.  
When I was little, and my grandmother told me she’d had breast surgery, I thought life handed out ordeals according to people’s capacities, and that it was impossible for something like that to happen to me, because I just wouldn’t survive it.

But little by little, life goes by, and you realize you’re not so unique that a small needle is going to do something different to you than it does to anyone else. It’s not going to break inside. A vein isn’t going to explode. The needle will treat you exactly the same as everyone else.

So once again, probably for the fifth time or so in my life, I went to get a Pap smear. I went terrified, of course. Then I got scared when they asked for a colposcopy and thought: *seven years, Carolina, you’re an idiot.* And I got scared again when they told me I had CIN 2.

For once, the internet was comforting. It was like the best prognosis TV commercial: success rates, optimistic percentages, and the explicit promise that pain was something that belonged to other diseases. I had the best precancer you could have.  


It reassured me so much that I thought I’d find even more certainty by reading real stories, so I went on Reddit. And that’s why I’m writing this here today. If everything up to that point was being managed quite well, suddenly Reddit kept me awake for three nights in a row. The stories were of the “worst experience of my life” kind, and up from there.

It’s okay. It’s not a lie. But it’s the truth of one among millions. Some women have the worst experience of their lives during a Pap smear. And if you’re one of them, ask for general anesthesia. I’m afraid of Pap smears, but when it comes down to it, the speculum bothers me a bit and I barely notice the rest.

In this process I learned that when the brain doesn’t have comparative data, it makes it up. Like AI.  
And when they open you, scrape you, or cut you in there, even if it doesn’t hurt, the brain panics and protests: *hey, what is this, take it out, this shouldn’t be happening*. It’s not always pain; sometimes it’s just an alarm.

I’m not saying it doesn’t hurt. For many women it does, even though none of these things hurt me. They only bothered me a little.  
But of course, they’re going into the most intimate and precious place, the one you only let chosen people into after a rigorous selection process (with standards that fluctuate depending on weather, season and moment of your menstrual cycle), but which is yours in any case. The brain protects that, and in these situations it gets a bit overly dramatic.

And we don’t all start from the same place. Many women have lived through assaults. And the brain remembers. Someone touches you there without permission, outside the context of pleasure, and the body responds with terror. There is no exaggeration there. The pain is real.  
It doesn’t have to be your case. It wasn’t mine.

I read all those stories and had to consciously repeat something simple to myself: people who write on Reddit usually do so because they had a bad experience, not to say that nothing happened.

So I wanted to write this. Yes it was: uneventful.

And yes, even though I was terrified, I must have done a good job during the colposcopy, because the doctor called me and recommended removing the damaged area under local anesthesia. When you’ve swallowed so many panic attacks that your friends would say that over those beers “Caro had a great time,” you develop an outstanding ability to behave. I also probably did well not to look bad in front of her.

I wasn’t thrilled about general anesthesia, so after a lot of research I convinced myself it wouldn’t be a big deal. That, on a sensory level, the colposcopy had been almost more uncomfortable. That I’d go ahead with local anesthesia, the LEEP, and whatever was needed. 

And it was true. It was nothing.

I woke up at 5:30 a.m. My girlfriend brought me a peeled mandarin in bed, and seeing her smiling face felt good. Honestly, eating a mandarin in the darkness at that hour is a bit surreal. I showered and we went out the door.

I had anticipated, as a many-times-awarded expert in the art of anticipation, that I would suffer tremendously on the metro on the way to the hospital. But it wasn’t true. It wasn’t like that while waiting to be called, nor even when they put me on the gurney and took me in an elevator where they had painted a blue sky with clouds. I suppose the intention was to inspire peace and distract from the hospital, but I don’t think there’s anything that reminds you more clearly that you’re in one than a fake sky.

They left me waiting outside the operating room door, where I spent about twenty minutes covered with a NASA-style thermal blanket. I wasn’t scared, but I was starting to feel a bit nervous. Other women arrived and were placed near me. I almost wished they’d lined us up; at that hour the body has the muscle memory of going into an after-party. It would have been a good joke to break the ice. I wondered whether I would have dared to say something if I had been in Spain, or if I would have felt a bit more comfortable in French. No one is okay there. I think a few words from a colleague whose most intimate organ is about to be severed would be appreciated. I would have liked to say something like: “I’m weird right now too, but we’ve got this, it’ll be over in no time”. I didn’t say anything. I don’t think I even said hi. Being spoken to in French scares me too.

I think that’s when I dissociated a little.

I had a kind of inner illumination in which I realized that worrying about things made no sense because nothing is in your control and the only thing that truly belongs to you is inhabiting the present moment. This, which is the most overused and repeated thing in the universe, I swear that at that moment, with my surgical cap and my trembling cervix, I understood it completely. All the calm in the world concentrated there, in that hallway. It caressed my hands and rested on my cheeks. I surrendered to the absolute acceptance of that instant. A functional nihilism, an ataraxia, something almost laughable but that I took very seriously right then.

Then I figured it was probably quite an elegant dissociation to protect me. Kudos to my defense mechanisms.

They took me into the operating room and that composure unraveled a bit, I won’t lie. An operating room is intimidating. There were maybe five or six people there, each dealing with something I will never understand. There’s a bed with leg supports, and unlike the gynecology office, here they strap your legs. There’s one of those huge lights pointing straight down at you… The doctor came over to me; to this day, she is the best person I know. If I believed in anything above the human in this life, I’d believe in her. I wouldn’t rule out starting to pray from now on, and praying to her.

“I know this is much uglier than my office and a bit scarier. Especially this ceiling.”

I nodded with one of those smiles that, if you don’t make a small effort, falls right off your face. ""Merci beaucoup"".

And then there was the other person I would tear my clothes for. The Guardian Angel nurse. A woman in her late fifties who stuck close to my face and told me she would be there during the whole procedure.

I didn’t know this role existed, but this person did exactly that: talk to me and protect me from my escalating mind.

“Now you’ll feel the anesthetic. Look, we count: one, two, three, four… a little pinch. One, two, three, four… another.”

That is exactly how long the discomfort from the anesthesia lasted. It feels like what you imagine. And it lasts so little that you don’t even have time to complain. I waited five minutes, though I now remember it as one. The Guardian Angel moved away for three seconds to grab something and, honestly, I was about to shout at her to come back.

“And now we go with the tool.”

Here I got a bit more scared, because THE TOOL. I think she said something in French like *l’outil*, but she could have said *la Concorde* and I would have understood perfectly what she meant. To this day I haven’t looked up what the tool looks like. Maybe that would be scarier. In case I ever need another conization in the future, I don’t want to know what they put in there.

I kept the logic in my head, but my brain was screaming: *WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOWING THEM TO DO THERE!?*

The nurse, as if hearing this, said: “nothing, nothing, just a few seconds"". And they removed it.

For me it lasted ten seconds, maybe a bit more. I felt pressure and a little discomfort, not pain. The brain may try to tell you that yes, it’s pain. It’s not true. But in those moments the brain turns into a dramatic actress straight out of a Molière play.

They put in another tool to cauterize and that was it. A similar sensation, even milder.

“It’s over,” said the Guardian Angel.

I couldn’t stop repeating ""merci, merci"" and ""vous êtes très gentilles"" to everyone. That sentence I learned in the first weeks after arriving in Paris, and which I don’t think I’ll ever say again with so much feeling.

It was over. It was nothing. And it was true. It was true that I would say: it was nothing.

I left thinking about all the stories I’d read and how almost no one writes when everything goes normally. I laughed at that sky with painted clouds in the elevator. I had a coffee. I went home by metro.

I still don’t know whether the margins are positive or not. That is, whether what they removed was completely clean. Hopefully yes. And if not, then whatever needs to be done will be done; there’s no other choice.

If this happened to you, I know, it sucks. I repeat two things to myself. The first: it’s one of the least terrible diseases there is. The second: you’re not special. Diseases, like needles, are democratic. And sometimes, it’s true, nothing happens.

1pxpjgu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxpjgu,A Cinematographer’s thoughts on the GR III vs. iPhone 17 Pro (and why I might have to let it go),"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share some shots I’ve taken with my Ricoh GR III since buying it this past summer. As a cinematographer, I picked this up wanting a backstage/carry around cam, that was truly pocketable but didn't sacrifice character.

The Good:

I’ve taken this thing everywhere—on professional sets, location scouts, and just long walks.
▫️ The Size: It’s genuinely invisible.
▫️ The Colors: The Positive Film simulation and straight-out-of-camera (SOOC) JPEGs are stunning. It has a texture that digital usually lacks.
▫️ Versatility: For a fixed lens, it rarely feels limiting.

The Conflict:

Here is the hard part. I’ve been shooting with the 17 Pro using Bayer RAW, and honestly... the gap is closing. For quick snaps or ""memory keeping,"" the phone is getting aggressively close to the GR in terms of dynamic range and malleability in post. I find myself asking if the difference in image quality is enough to justify carrying a separate device, even one this small.

The Reality:

I live in Ukraine, and as many of you know, the energy situation is tough right now. With the frequent power outages, my priorities are shifting from ""perfect grain"" to ""keeping the lights on."" I’m currently trying to justify keeping the camera, but I’m leaning towards swapping it for a portable power station.

Has anyone else felt their phone encroaching on their dedicated compact camera territory lately? Or should I hold onto this gem?

1pxpirp,https://i.redd.it/tp73a7gmnx9g1.png,It's the old 50p problem,"A debate that reverbarates unabated around the demickiest part of the internet, is one requiring only the faintest kiss of the edge of the saucer before it rears its ug-e-ly misshapen head. 

Framed simply:

SM: ""the 50p in terms of money is not what’s important. The fact that you think you don’t have to give me money back because it’s only 50p, that was the point at stake. It’s me who makes the decision ‘Oh don’t worry about the 50p’ not you, ‘It’s only 50p I’m not gonna give it to ya"" (RGSs01e09)

One may find themselves mistaking mean Merchant as the protagonist, pressing the nonchalant Pilkington -groping at tight jean pockets, his rangy, miserly fingers evoking sympathy vis-a-vis the laissez-faire, c'est-la-vie ""producer"". 

Might we, however, mull over that maybe the Manc is mean, and meager amounts of monies matter muchly to the monkey man?*

Let's reminded me of XFMs04e05:

KP: ""I'm just saying, don't go putting money in it. That's all I'm saying. Let him play pinball, but don't waste 20p""

Clearly Karl considers 20 pence worth considering.

RGSs01e12 provides insight somewhat closer to the former boxers home.

RG: ""How did you meet Suzanne?""

KP: ""Uh, that was when I was working with her. And she gave me 20p for the hot chocolate machine. She never asked for it back. I thought, ""she's alright""""

With box box box box robbing, scam contriving blood coursing through Pilchards muscly body, with memoies of catalogue debts and overpriced scones sizzling inside the k.man (and his brain) like sausages in a toaster, 20-50p is not to be let go of as easily as jellyfish!

20_50p is a defining moment in a relationship when your hair is infused with coffee mug suds.

Mechants mistake was asking for it back!

Where do I go from here?,"Hey Reddit, I don't know what I'm really doing on here, but these past few days have been so confusing for me, and I feel like I'm going crazy. My husband and I have been married for 5 years, no kids yet, but we've been trying, or at least we were up until this moment, as I don't know how to move past this. We've been together since college, and I've always felt like I've known just the type of person he was inside and out. He loves to grind his own coffee beans and prefers to wear socks throughout the night so that the floor doesn't feel cold in the morning, little things like that. We've always communicated any issues we've ever had and always resolved them or found different ways to handle them. So now when I speak of this, it's something that came completely left field for me, at least relationship-wise.

My husband has never been the type to have any weird kinks; between the two of us, he had always been the more vanilla one, while I was more open to experimenting a bit bedroom-wise. I can't stress enough how vanilla my husband truly is and was up until this moment.

We celebrated Christmas at my in-laws' this year, as my family lives across several state borders and would've been impossible to reach with plane ticket prices this year. I had celebrated with them before and indulged in their fun tradition of sleeping over on Christmas Eve after a nice meal, and by Christmas morning, after breakfast, everyone wakes up and opens presents like we're kids again. It's fun, and I enjoy it, and my husband has always been so enthusiastic when it comes to gift giving, which I've known to be a love language of his throughout the years, so I always get pretty excited when Christmas comes around. Last year, he gifted me a nearly identical replica of an old stuffed bunny I used to have when I was younger, but lost in a house fire that happened when I was 8, which he managed to find through the only two photos existing of me as a kid holding it.

This year, we all gathered around, and I gifted him a set of carving tools for his new woodworking hobby, which he's been really invested in. I open my gift, and I see a dog collar, a pink dog collar with a little bone-shaped tag on it that has my name on it. My mother-in-law was near me when I opened it and obviously saw how flustered I was, and she didn't know how to quite react to it either, giving my husband a sort of clueless questioning look. My husband kept looking at me with this big smile on his face, expecting the same sort of reaction I always gave his grand gestures and thoughtful gifts, but safe to say he was very disappointed. I actually started laughing because how else are you supposed to react to a gift like that? I have no history with dogs, as I was actually a notorious cat lover growing up and had several as pets throughout the years. My husband, in front of his entire family, kept gesturing towards the collar and told me to give it a try on to see if it fit. I felt so embarrassed. We had always experimented with certain things, but never anything like this, and he made it seem like some open fetish we had in front of his entire family. I asked him why he thought I would want something like this, and he kept trying to save face by saying it was just something new he wanted to try out. I didn't even want to hear him out, and I practically threw the collar at him and said I needed a moment. I went out to the car just to have a breather but he came out all upset and bewildered asking why I was acting like this. I couldnt handle it anymore and I drove off and went to spend the holidays with a close, single friend of mine, who I've been staying with these past few days as my husband keeps blowing up my phone, and I'm currently writing to Reddit at 3AM on her couch. I don't even know what to do anymore. Why would he think it was okay to embarrass me like that in front of his family? It feels so out of character for him to do something like this. Sorry if there's anything weird in the writing, I can explain anything asked. I've just been thinking about so much in my time away from him.

A woman meets a man right after christmas while grocery shopping for new years eve. They fall for each other, but are both loners and dont want any emotional goings on for their solo new years traditions. But they plan to get in touch after new years. They part without exchanging numbers or anything, because they say they will meet again at the shop in the new year ""if fate will bring them together again."" which both know they will be there at exactly one week from now, same time, and they laugh about it. ""So its not really fate. Its a Date."" ""It is fate somehow id like to think of it."" ""Right. Its fate that we both go shopping at the same day, at the same time."" ""Exactly."" ""So its a fate date."" ""I like the sound of that."" They only shake each others hand, but they hold on to it, not wanting to let go, and say bye for like 9 times back and forth. They just dont want to leave. ""I dont think ima be able to let go."" ""Me neither."" So they stand their, in front of the supermarket exit, holding their hand. A few youngsters pass by and while being pranky dicksters all the time in the shop, one of them realizes the man and woman and bumps his two friends to shut up until they pass them. He cant help but smile at the couple. When they are out, they go ""brah did you see her!?"" ""11/10 milf material right there."" ""someone's getting lucky tonight fer sure."" they laugh and go. The couple didnt hear them and are still standing there, looking into their eyes. ""So? What are we gonna do?"" ""Im still thinking."" ""I kinda wanna respect our boundaries. But then again im thinking... i also really really... really... wanna... just... be with you... right now."" ""Same here."" ""My hands getting sweaty."" ""I dont mind."" She smiles. Another couple, best agers, passes them by, smiling to themselves. ""Should we get outta the way?"" ""Mhmh... i dont wanna move. I kinda wanna stay like this... like... forever."" They smile. ""Okay... i dont think any of the two us will be able to keep in line with our new years traditions now, will we?"" She softly shakes her head, smiling. ""May i be unabashedly honest with you?"" ""Sure."" ""I really wanna kiss you."" ""Well what are you waiting for?"" ""I enjoy the feeling of ""wanting"" to kiss you. You know? The anticipation. The tension between us. The sparks flying back and forth. How about we keep that up a little longer?"" ""...Honestly this seems kinda hard to pull thru with."" They laugh. ""But yeah... i like that notion. Well... actually i love."" ""Okay. I'll come a little closer, so we can talk this through... like... discretely."" He jokes. She smiles. ""Okay."" He comes a step closer to her, not letting go of her hand, but so they are not that far apart, taking up so much space for peple to pass by more easily. ""Lets count to three. On three. So... one two and ON three, we let go of each others hand. We both get our possibly already frying groceries home, pack our bags for a week in a very snowy area and then we meet at... lets say 11pm... i come pick you up... or we meet somewhere... and then we spend new years together... in a yet to be disclosed location, about 6 hours from here, we can take my car or yours, if you like to drive yourself, we take a break as soon as we feel like it, spend the night at a shabby motel. And tomorrow morning we arrive at this yet undisclosed location and wave the past year goodbye and prepare to welcome the new one. How bout that?"" She laughs, not believing what he just proposed. ""This sounds... all kinds of unreasonable. Irrational. Maybe even stupid. And definitely crazy... in the best possible way."" ""I know... its a terrible idea."" They laugh, she bends over a little, bumping in to him, holding on to his shoulder. ""Oops, sorry."" ""Oh thats okay. I mean... hey, watch it."" She looks him in the eyes. ""What you just said... your plan... i by the life of me can not remember when i last felt as alive as i am doing right now, having listened to this idea of yours."" He smiles. ""Well what can i say, it just came to my head... while i was looking at you."" She blushes. ""God stop it. I'm getting all hot."" She laughs and waves air to herself. ""You're just realizing now that you're hot? Well im way ahead of ya there."" She chuckles. ""Shut up."" ""Why, I told ya, our groceries are already frying i bet."" They take a moment. ""So...?"" She thinks. ""Gosh this is... this is something else."" ""I know right? I also have no idea when i felt that alive... maybe... ever."" ""So should we really do this?"" ""You asking me? Well i was ready to go a minute before i told you about the idea, so... theres that."" They laugh. She goes. ""Ok... (exhales)... on three right?"" A warm shock to him. He smiles with beaming glee, but keeps his cool. ""Uh yeah... on three. one two and go."" ""Ok."" ""But we dont say bye or anything. We gotta get out before they call security on us. (both laugh) So, on three, we leave, no looking back... well ok there will be looking back, who am i kidding. But we leave! And meet at 11 at... lets just say on the parking lot? Right next to the entrance, ok?"" ""Got it."" ""Ok. you ready?"" ""Ready."" ""And..."" both count at the same time, him nodding the rythm. ""One..."" taking time. smiling. chuckling. the supermarket bell going, about to close. ""Two..."" Smiles. ""Ill see ya in a bit."" ""See ya in a bit."" ""Bye."" ""Bye."" He nods. ""Three!"" They part and he jokingly runs for the exit. She bursts into laughter. He turns back, laughing hard and holds up his hand to say goodbye. Then he jokingly runs for his car. She waits a second, catching her breath. The cashier women watch her and smile, happy for her. She exhales, realizes their looks, holds up her hand to say bye to them and leaves the shop.

They meet at the parking lot. Its raining lightly. He helps her get the baggage into his car, after she points at it, indicating she wants him to drive. He opens her door and runs around the car to get it and drive of in the mild rain, almost turning into snow.

They drive through the night. Laughing in the car, telling stories.

The car parks next to a cozy, modern budget motel. The car lights turn off.

They sit in the empty motel lounge, late at night, talking over hot decaf coffee. You can tell its that wholesome kind of deep talk, where you really get to know each other. They touch hands over the table.

If they sleep in one room, a double bed, or two single beds, or if they even got separate rooms, to keep their ""tension"" for each other up, is maybe not disclosed in the story. It doesnt matter too much. But the most fun way would be that they got a loft bed because it was the last room available and so he is sleeping below and she is sleeping atop. They keep talking the whole night until they finally get too tired in the early morning. She lets her arm down and he takes her hand. ""I really wanna kiss your hand right now. But im afraid that would break the tension."" ""Id really want that too... but you might be right."" ""God, when's it the new year already!!?"" he jokes in a desperate sounding way. She smiles. ""Seriously tho."" He smiles. ""I know."" ""It was your idea. I can only say you have no clue what you got yourself into with that. I dont know what will happen once i am off that leash."" His eyes go big. ""Oh my fucking god. Youre killing me."" She chuckles, jokingly. ""Hehe. And with that... im wishing you sweet dreams."" ""Pfff i sure will."" ""You sleep well now."" ""You too."" A pause. ""Shit i just wanted to make a kissing noise."" She laughs. ""Me too."" ""Nope. We don't. We cherish the tension."" She turns around to sleep, and jokingly utters: ""Just you wait."" He smiles and also gets comfortable to sleep.

In the morning they drive off. The car goes up into a mountain region. The sourroundings get colder and coder and finally, all is covered in deep, white, fresh snow, big frothy snowflakes silently falling. They are cruising up the mountain serpentine roads, hand on hand next to the gear shift.

The car comes along a long road, out of a deep forest. The sun is just coming up above the snowy mountainpeaks and finally, the view over their final destination is revealed. St. Moritz. The woman ghasps in excitement, almost getting tears in her eyes, overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery. ""Oh my god."" ""Dont get me wrong. I dont have that kinda money to pretend like we are a part of this whole champagne thing. But theres a nice little discount supermarket we could get some croissants and coffee at..."" ""That sounds lovely.""

And so they spent their new years week together in St. Moritz, staying at a budget hotel not far off of it. They go for long walks in the snow. Enjoy the posh shopping streets. Have overpriced Hot Cocoa with Icecream in it, just for a fun taste of the ""rich people"" experience. They stroll along the Lake and take pictures together.

Finally it is New Years Eve. The celebrations are beautiful and grand. They count down for the new Year. The Man and Woman stand in a spot where they can overlook the big fireworks over the lake. As they count down they look into each others eyes, their breaths visible in the icy cold, but both of them snuggled up in warm winter clothes and hats, rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes. As the clock strikes midnight, the fireworks go off and light up the whole valley in a beautifully warm and festively sparkling light. They get closer. ""Happy new year."" ""Happy new year."" They lean in and finally... they kiss. Softly and slowly first and then with slowly increasing tension and passion, embracing each other firmly and forcefully, to feel their bodies touching each other beneath the thick clothes. And while the whole valley is celebrating, they still kiss. For minutes. The fireworks going off in the clear, starry night sky. Until finally, she breaks the kiss for a moment to jokingly whisper. ""If you dont want me to rip your clothes of right here in front of everybody... possibly getting us into a beautiful swiss jail... we should get the fuck out of here."" He smiles at her and they both start laughing, hugging and she grabs him to kiss him some more. He lets go and picks her up, as if he would carry her into the honeymoon suite, she startingly goes ""woop!"" and holds her hand in front of her mouth, as she startled some posh people around them, but they realize her happiness and dont mind it, with one old couple smiling at them. He is only able to carry her for two or three steps and then jokingly goes ""Oh hell no, my back. My back."" and lets her down as easy as possible. Her laughing out loud and then helping him, ""You ok?"" ""Yes yes, its... its nothing... its... oh shit..."" Both laugh. Him holding his back (for real) and she supports him with her arm. He goes: ""Quick! To the car! I need to lay down!"" ""No wait, you serious?"" ""Nah its fine. But you dont mind being on top all night, do ya?"" Again she breaks into loud laughter, slapping him, he walks upright for a few steps, so he is ok, only rubbing his back a little. He pulls her back to him, they kiss, she puts her arm around his waist and rubs his back. He puts his arm around her and rubs her shoulder. With the fireworks still going, snuggled up into each other, they head over to the car. And so they valley of St. Moritz, between the houses, at the banks of the frozen lake and on top of the mountain peaks... a new year is dawning.

1pxpc53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pxpc53/was_i_groomed_by_my_highschool_teacher/,Was I groomed by my highschool teacher?,"

\*\* if you have experience with teacher grooming or are well versed on the subject I would really appreciate some advice or analysis of this situation 😭 

for context I graduated summer 2025 and am in uni now. 

when I first had this teacher I was in grade 10, he would puts his hands on my shoulders a lot and once put his arm around my chest to restrain me while he  yanked my phone out of my hand (more teasingly than violently). others thought he was weird, I didn't really pay much attention to him or school at all tbh. 

grade 11 I had him again, but had started to try harder in school. he noticed this and pulled me aside after a few weeks of school and gave this long inspiring speech about all these observations he’d made about me (that I acted like a dumb blonde, played dumb, pretended to be goofy etc when really I was smart and capable and I just need to believe in myself). dumb blonde comment is a little strange from a teacher, but tbh at the time i really appreciated him noticing me. I was in a toxic friend clique and very much uninterested in academics for most of HS and at this time was only just starting to discover that I liked learning and was in the process of dropping my shitty friends.

by 2nd semester of gr 11 i didn’t have his class but I started spending more time in his class in my free block etc . he’d always ask how I was and we’d talk about tons of stuff. I was quite depressed at the time and it was nice to have someone to confide in. he asked a lot of personal questions but also shared a lot of secrets with me, (all just random stories about his  life) telling me not to tell anyone etc. 

by Semester 1 of gr 12 I was even more depressed (whoopsies) so I spent more and more time in his room. he would let me skip my other classes to do this. he started asking more personal questions about my family (relationship with my dad in particular) but for the most part things were pretry much the same as in grade 11, just lots and lots of talks, many times a week. 

in semester 2 of gr 12 i had his class and he started putting his hands on my shoulders a lot and when I didn’t show up to class he would apparently freak out. he kept reiterating around this time that I used to be a ditzy dumb blonde and now (I dyed my hair back to its natural brunette colour) I was sophisticated and capable, all bc of a few words from him in grade 11. tbh, I totally bought it. I believed he was completely responsible for my academic success. 

at grad he hugged me many times and after grad we started following each other on insta (when I was still his student as school wasn’t to end until 3 weeks later). he would message me constantly, sometimes even in class when I was across from him in the room.

 the last 2 weeks of school he hugged me many times and  on the last day said that he noticed I was uncomfortable hugging him and that this was because I hadn’t learned how to accept affection before. he also made  some pretty insane dirty jokes. he told me we weren’t student and teacher anymore because he has as much to learn from me as I do from him and that he views me as his friend now and our connection will last long after i leave the school as  friendship. (He also at some point before this said he sees me more like the daughter he never had than a student, odd switch up) 

the summer was tough for me, and I reflected on a lot of the comments he had made that I had lowkey forgotten about or never thought of as weird before ( for example in gr 11 when I dyed my hair darker he said how my hair looked so good because women with green eyes look so alluring with dark hair followed up with “but I shouldnt be saying this I’m your teacher..”). he was messaging me throughout the summer and I was trying not to respond but I was an emotional wreck and I felt like he was the only one who truly understood me. he kept saying things like “that’s what friends are for” after giving advice, and I kinda felt annoyed bc I wanted him to be my teacher not my friend. it felt like all the good talks and everything we used to have was gone. additionally he would like all the insta stories I posted of pictures of myself but none of  my friends or scenery etc. he asked very personal questions about my sexuality and started pressuring me to cut off certain friends saying they weren’t good for me. he was asking to go out for coffee, sending reels with dirty jokes in them, and overall reaching out 3 times a day at least. he told me many times that we have a unique connection that no one understands, etc. 

finally i blocked him after an exchange over dm where i had asked for help with  something to say in a  uni discussion bc i was overwhelmed with the amount of nerds in the class and he said something “naughty” i could do to shut up the nerds is ”show cleavage.”  

  
there’s probably a lot of weird behaviour and comments I’m forgetting but this the premise it. what trips me up is he is a strange guy and I don’t know if any of this stuff was intentional. grooming seems like it has to be calculated and intentional.

i saw this teacher as my hero and its been hard to see him as anything other than that.  now im back in town for the holidays and my friends have been visiting the school and he has asked so many people what is happening with me and why I haven’t been in contact with him for months, saying he’s worried etc. the more I think abt it the more I feel like i would never have gotten so attached to him if he hadn’t behaved unprofessionally. but also, i never felt uncomfortable telling him about personal stuff or even with the hugging or touching my shoulders, maybe I even liked it (at the time) and felt like he was kind of a father figure in my life? I don’t know. im really conflicted and I don’t know what to do or how to process any of this. ",1,1766921781.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

**The Resolution**

A woman meets a man right after christmas while grocery shopping for new years eve. They fall for each other, but are both loners and dont want any emotional goings on for their solo new years traditions. But they plan to get in touch after new years. They part without exchanging numbers or anything, because they say they will meet again at the shop in the new year ""if fate will bring them together again."" which both know they will be there at exactly one week from now, same time, and they laugh about it. ""So its not really fate. Its a Date."" ""It is fate somehow id like to think of it."" ""Right. Its fate that we both go shopping at the same day, at the same time."" ""Exactly."" ""So its a fate date."" ""I like the sound of that."" They only shake each others hand, but they hold on to it, not wanting to let go, and say bye for like 9 times back and forth. They just dont want to leave. ""I dont think ima be able to let go."" ""Me neither."" So they stand their, in front of the supermarket exit, holding their hand. A few youngsters pass by and while being pranky dicksters all the time in the shop, one of them realizes the man and woman and bumps his two friends to shut up until they pass them. He cant help but smile at the couple. When they are out, they go ""brah did you see her!?"" ""11/10 milf material right there."" ""someone's getting lucky tonight fer sure."" they laugh and go. The couple didnt hear them and are still standing there, looking into their eyes. ""So? What are we gonna do?"" ""Im still thinking."" ""I kinda wanna respect our boundaries. But then again im thinking... i also really really... really... wanna... just... be with you... right now."" ""Same here."" ""My hands getting sweaty."" ""I dont mind."" She smiles. Another couple, best agers, passes them by, smiling to themselves. ""Should we get outta the way?"" ""Mhmh... i dont wanna move. I kinda wanna stay like this... like... forever."" They smile. ""Okay... i dont think any of the two us will be able to keep in line with our new years traditions now, will we?"" She softly shakes her head, smiling. ""May i be unabashedly honest with you?"" ""Sure."" ""I really wanna kiss you."" ""Well what are you waiting for?"" ""I enjoy the feeling of ""wanting"" to kiss you. You know? The anticipation. The tension between us.

""What you just said... your plan... i by the life of me can not remember when i last felt as alive as i am doing right now, having listened to this idea of yours."" He smiles. ""Well what can i say, it just came to my head... while i was looking at you."" She blushes. ""God stop it. I'm getting all hot."" She laughs and waves air to herself.

1pxpamt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pxpamt/canon_events/,CANON EVENTS,"( used chatgpt to get it together)

I’m 23M, from a family business background. I met her on Tinder about three years ago.

This post isn’t to vilify her or paint myself as perfect — I know I had flaws. I just want clarity, because I feel like I lost myself trying to hold on.

⸻

June 5, 2023 — The First Canon Event

We were in our texting phase and had planned our first proper date. I was excited — the kind of excitement that doesn’t let you sleep.

At 6:00 AM, I opened my house door half-asleep and found Income Tax officers standing there.

It turned into a full raid — a lady commissioner and assistants. My parents were asleep. Everything flipped upside down.

I remember telling one officer in Hindi, half-joking out of shock:

“Aai hi aana tha… mera aaj date tha.”

I asked for my phone because I didn’t want her to think I ghosted her. I called and told her I couldn’t come and might not be reachable for a few days.

That was my first real canon event.

A few days later, I explained everything. She understood. We finally met.

⸻

The Relationship

Our first movie together was Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.

That’s where the idea of canon events became “our thing”. I told her she was my canon event.

We grew close fast.

I won’t lie — both of us were toxic in different ways.

But we also helped each other grow.

I was deeply invested. My college attendance dropped. I knew once graduation ended and I entered the family business, time would become limited — but I still chose her.

⸻

November 19, 2023 — My Birthday

She proposed to me.

Best day of my life — even though she forgot my birthday itself.

Around that time, there were fights. She would get upset when I went out, even with family. I tried to adjust because I saw her as someone sensitive, someone I wanted to protect.

⸻

December 31, 2023 — First Cheating Incident

On New Year’s Eve, while I was with my family at a hill station, she called me crying.

She told me she had cheated on me “by mistake.”

She’s a paramedic.

I was shocked.

I spent hours thinking — and then I forgave her.

I genuinely believed that’s what love meant.

Things were never the same, but over months, they stabilized.

⸻

Early–Mid 2024 — Red Flags I Ignored

I was in my final year, under pressure from exams and family stress. Communication reduced.

She started making male friends at the hospital and online apps.

She went with a senior colleague to a café that used to be our place.

It hurt — but I told myself not to be controlling.

⸻

The Breakup Setup

After my exams, I finally had a few free days and wanted to meet her.

Plans kept shifting. One day she said she already had plans with a “friend.”

I didn’t push.

We met later at our usual checkpoint near McDonald’s — where she loved iced coffee.

Something felt off.

She asked for my phone.

I thought she was joking — but she deleted 3,000+ photos and videos, emptied the recycle bin, and said:

“We’re done.”

I walked away in shock and anger.

⸻

The Truth

The next day, we met again (my sister was briefly present).

She told me she had been seeing a guy from Pune for months.

The “friend” plan was him.

They had kissed.

I begged. I told her I forgave her before.

She said:

“That was your choice. I didn’t ask you to forgive me.”

She said she had planned the breakup and had been texting him while talking to me.

Then she left.

She blocked me everywhere — Instagram, WhatsApp, Chess.com, Telegram.

⸻

Aftermath

I cried in my mother’s arms.

For a while, anger kept me functional.

Later, she messaged saying I “didn’t even try” to get her back — then blocked me again.

Months later, she called me yelling, accusing me of trying to approach her on Instagram. I hadn’t. She hung up.

I asked once more to meet for closure. She cancelled.

⸻

The Final Breakdown

I made the worst decision of my life.

I went to her hospital to talk — waited three hours.

When I tapped her shoulder, she reacted like I was harassing her.

I begged. I broke down.

I gave her a gift — Sally, a Cars character we shared meaning with.

She threw it in a public dustbin.

I picked it up in front of people.

She sat near police officers and told me she would never give me a chance and threatened legal action.

Later, she called my mother saying I was harassing her.

My mother told me one thing that broke me but grounded me:

“Just because you loved her doesn’t mean she had to love you back.

She cheated when things were good. She isn’t grateful.

Don’t lose your value. Come home.”",1,1766921632.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

**The Resolution**

A woman meets a man right after christmas while grocery shopping for new years eve. They fall for each other, but are both loners and dont want any emotional goings on for their solo new years traditions. But they plan to get in touch after new years. They part without exchanging numbers or anything, because they say they will meet again at the shop in the new year ""if fate will bring them together again."" which both know they will be there at exactly one week from now, same time, and they laugh about it. ""So its not really fate. Its a Date."" ""It is fate somehow id like to think of it."" ""Right. Its fate that we both go shopping at the same day, at the same time."" ""Exactly."" ""So its a fate date."" ""I like the sound of that."" They only shake each others hand, but they hold on to it, not wanting to let go, and say bye for like 9 times back and forth. They just dont want to leave. ""I dont think ima be able to let go."" ""Me neither."" So they stand their, in front of the supermarket exit, holding their hand. A few youngsters pass by and while being pranky dicksters all the time in the shop, one of them realizes the man and woman and bumps his two friends to shut up until they pass them. He cant help but smile at the couple. When they are out, they go ""brah did you see her!?"" ""11/10 milf material right there."" ""someone's getting lucky tonight fer sure."" they laugh and go. The couple didnt hear them and are still standing there, looking into their eyes. ""So? What are we gonna do?"" ""Im still thinking."" ""I kinda wanna respect our boundaries. But then again im thinking... i also really really... really... wanna... just... be with you... right now."" ""Same here."" ""My hands getting sweaty."" ""I dont mind."" She smiles. Another couple, best agers, passes them by, smiling to themselves. ""Should we get outta the way?"" ""Mhmh... i dont wanna move. I kinda wanna stay like this... like... forever."" They smile. ""Okay... i dont think any of the two us will be able to keep in line with our new years traditions now, will we?"" She softly shakes her head, smiling. ""May i be unabashedly honest with you?"" ""Sure."" ""I really wanna kiss you."" ""Well what are you waiting for?"" ""I enjoy the feeling of ""wanting"" to kiss you. You know? The anticipation. The tension between us. The sparks flying back and forth. How about we keep that up a little longer?"" ""...Honestly this seems kinda hard to pull thru with."" They laugh. ""But yeah... i like that notion. Well... actually i love."" ""Okay. I'll come a little closer, so we can talk this through... like... discretely."" He jokes. She smiles. ""Okay."" He comes a step closer to her, not letting go of her hand, but so they are not that far apart, taking up so much space for peple to pass by more easily. ""Lets count to three. On three. So... one two and ON three, we let go of each others hand. We both get our possibly already frying groceries home, pack our bags for a week in a very snowy area and then we meet at... lets say 11pm... i come pick you up... or we meet somewhere... and then we spend new years together... in a yet to be disclosed location, about 6 hours from here, we can take my car or yours, if you like to drive yourself, we take a break as soon as we feel like it, spend the night at a shabby motel. And tomorrow morning we arrive at this yet undisclosed location and wave the past year goodbye and prepare to welcome the new one. How bout that?"" She laughs, not believing what he just proposed. ""This sounds... all kinds of unreasonable. Irrational. Maybe even stupid. And definitely crazy... in the best possible way."" ""I know... its a terrible idea."" They laugh, she bends over a little, bumping in to him, holding on to his shoulder. ""Oops, sorry."" ""Oh thats okay. I mean... hey, watch it."" She looks him in the eyes. ""What you just said... your plan... i by the life of me can not remember when i last felt as alive as i am doing right now, having listened to this idea of yours."" He smiles. ""Well what can i say, it just came to my head... while i was looking at you."" She blushes. ""God stop it. I'm getting all hot."" She laughs and waves air to herself. ""You're just realizing now that you're hot? Well im way ahead of ya there."" She chuckles. ""Shut up."" ""Why, I told ya, our groceries are already frying i bet."" They take a moment. ""So...?"" She thinks. ""Gosh this is... this is something else."" ""I know right? I also have no idea when i felt that alive... maybe... ever."" ""So should we really do this?"" ""You asking me? Well i was ready to go a minute before i told you about the idea, so... theres that."" They laugh. She goes. ""Ok... (exhales)... on three right?"" A warm shock to him. He smiles with beaming glee, but keeps his cool. ""Uh yeah... on three. one two and go."" ""Ok."" ""But we dont say bye or anything. We gotta get out before they call security on us. (both laugh) So, on three, we leave, no looking back... well ok there will be looking back, who am i kidding. But we leave! And meet at 11 at... lets just say on the parking lot? Right next to the entrance, ok?"" ""Got it."" ""Ok. you ready?"" ""Ready."" ""And..."" both count at the same time, him nodding the rythm. ""One..."" taking time. smiling. chuckling. the supermarket bell going, about to close. ""Two..."" Smiles. ""Ill see ya in a bit."" ""See ya in a bit."" ""Bye."" ""Bye."" He nods. ""Three!"" They part and he jokingly runs for the exit. She bursts into laughter. He turns back, laughing hard and holds up his hand to say goodbye. Then he jokingly runs for his car. She waits a second, catching her breath. The cashier women watch her and smile, happy for her. She exhales, realizes their looks, holds up her hand to say bye to them and leaves the shop.

They meet at the parking lot. Its raining lightly. He helps her get the baggage into his car, after she points at it, indicating she wants him to drive. He opens her door and runs around the car to get it and drive of in the mild rain, almost turning into snow.

They drive through the night. Laughing in the car, telling stories.

The car parks next to a cozy, modern budget motel. The car lights turn off.

They sit in the empty motel lounge, late at night, talking over hot decaf coffee. You can tell its that wholesome kind of deep talk, where you really get to know each other. They touch hands over the table.

If they sleep in one room, a double bed, or two single beds, or if they even got separate rooms, to keep their ""tension"" for each other up, is maybe not disclosed in the story. It doesnt matter too much. But the most fun way would be that they got a loft bed because it was the last room available and so he is sleeping below and she is sleeping atop. They keep talking the whole night until they finally get too tired in the early morning. She lets her arm down and he takes her hand. ""I really wanna kiss your hand right now. But im afraid that would break the tension."" ""Id really want that too... but you might be right."" ""God, when's it the new year already!!?"" he jokes in a desperate sounding way. She smiles. ""Seriously tho."" He smiles. ""I know."" ""It was your idea. I can only say you have no clue what you got yourself into with that. I dont know what will happen once i am off that leash."" His eyes go big. ""Oh my fucking god. Youre killing me."" She chuckles, jokingly. ""Hehe. And with that... im wishing you sweet dreams."" ""Pfff i sure will."" ""You sleep well now."" ""You too."" A pause. ""Shit i just wanted to make a kissing noise."" She laughs. ""Me too."" ""Nope. We don't. We cherish the tension."" She turns around to sleep, and jokingly utters: ""Just you wait."" He smiles and also gets comfortable to sleep.

In the morning they drive off. The car goes up into a mountain region. The sourroundings get colder and coder and finally, all is covered in deep, white, fresh snow, big frothy snowflakes silently falling. They are cruising up the mountain serpentine roads, hand on hand next to the gear shift.

The car comes along a long road, out of a deep forest. The sun is just coming up above the snowy mountainpeaks and finally, the view over their final destination is revealed. St. Moritz. The woman ghasps in excitement, almost getting tears in her eyes, overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery. ""Oh my god."" ""Dont get me wrong. I dont have that kinda money to pretend like we are a part of this whole champagne thing. But theres a nice little discount supermarket we could get some croissants and coffee at..."" ""That sounds lovely.""

And so they spent their new years week together in St. Moritz, staying at a budget hotel not far off of it. They go for long walks in the snow. Enjoy the posh shopping streets. Have overpriced Hot Cocoa with Icecream in it, just for a fun taste of the ""rich people"" experience. They stroll along the Lake and take pictures together.

Finally it is New Years Eve. The celebrations are beautiful and grand. They count down for the new Year. The Man and Woman stand in a spot where they can overlook the big fireworks over the lake. As they count down they look into each others eyes, their breaths visible in the icy cold, but both of them snuggled up in warm winter clothes and hats, rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes. As the clock strikes midnight, the fireworks go off and light up the whole valley in a beautifully warm and festively sparkling light. They get closer. ""Happy new year."" ""Happy new year."" They lean in and finally... they kiss. Softly and slowly first and then with slowly increasing tension and passion, embracing each other firmly and forcefully, to feel their bodies touching each other beneath the thick clothes. And while the whole valley is celebrating, they still kiss. For minutes. The fireworks going off in the clear, starry night sky. Until finally, she breaks the kiss for a moment to jokingly whisper. ""If you dont want me to rip your clothes of right here in front of everybody... possibly getting us into a beautiful swiss jail... we should get the fuck out of here."" He smiles at her and they both start laughing, hugging and she grabs him to kiss him some more. He lets go and picks her up, as if he would carry her into the honeymoon suite, she startingly goes ""woop!"" and holds her hand in front of her mouth, as she startled some posh people around them, but they realize her happiness and dont mind it, with one old couple smiling at them. He is only able to carry her for two or three steps and then jokingly goes ""Oh hell no, my back. My back."" and lets her down as easy as possible. Her laughing out loud and then helping him, ""You ok?"" ""Yes yes, its... its nothing... its... oh shit..."" Both laugh. Him holding his back (for real) and she supports him with her arm. He goes: ""Quick! To the car! I need to lay down!"" ""No wait, you serious?"" ""Nah its fine. But you dont mind being on top all night, do ya?"" Again she breaks into loud laughter, slapping him, he walks upright for a few steps, so he is ok, only rubbing his back a little. He pulls her back to him, they kiss, she puts her arm around his waist and rubs his back. He puts his arm around her and rubs her shoulder. With the fireworks still going, snuggled up into each other, they head over to the car. And so they valley of St. Moritz, between the houses, at the banks of the frozen lake and on top of the mountain peaks... a new year is dawning.",1,1766921408.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

Probably my favourite lines in Too Sweet are the following:

”You know you’re bright as the morning/Soft as the rain/Pretty as a vine/Sweet as a grape/If you could sit in a barrel, maybe I’ll wait”

Firstly, it’s the extended winemaking metaphor (sun, rain, vine, and grape = wine), which I won’t dwell on because I’ve seen someone else talking about it.

But, after he’s just compared his love interest (? at any rate the person he’s speaking to) to wine, he says he’d rather have whiskey and coffee. **He’d rather have someone else but her.** 

When you keep this in mind, you will notice that when you look at the above lines, they all sound like compliments, right? But they’re actually things he hates about her.

“Sweet as a grape.” Literally the whole song is about him not liking her sweetness. The chorus says “You’re too sweet for me.” The song is called ”Too Sweet”.

”Bright as the morning.” Sounds nice, but we’re told earlier that what the speaker enjoys is to “wake up **dark** as a lake”. This is opposed to the brightness of the love interest.

”Pretty as a vine.” Might be a stretch, but a vine is clingy, and that’s not what an independent person as the speaker would want in a love interest.

”Soft as the rain.” Through his late nights and strong drinks, the speaker comes across as tough, the very opposite of softness.

Thank you for reading to the bottom! You’re a great human who takes interest in people who yabber on and on.

(Note: I have referred to the speaker as ”he” because Hozier sings it and the love interest as “she“ because Hozier has said he is a straight ally (Sorry if this breaks rule 4, mods.) Please don’t hate on me if you interpret this song with a different sexuality)",3,1766921252.0,Hozier,0,0.8,False

**The Resolution**  
  
A woman meets a man right after christmas while grocery shopping for new years eve. They fall for each other, but are both loners and dont want any emotional goings on for their solo new years traditions. But they plan to get in touch after new years. They part without exchanging numbers or anything, because they say they will meet again at the shop in the new year ""if fate will bring them together again."" which both know they will be there at exactly one week from now, same time, and they laugh about it. ""So its not really fate. Its a Date."" ""It is fate somehow id like to think of it."" ""Right. Its fate that we both go shopping at the same day, at the same time."" ""Exactly."" ""So its a fate date."" ""I like the sound of that."" They only shake each others hand, but they hold on to it, not wanting to let go, and say bye for like 9 times back and forth. They just dont want to leave. ""I dont think ima be able to let go."" ""Me neither."" So they stand their, in front of the supermarket exit, holding their hand. A few youngsters pass by and while being pranky dicksters all the time in the shop, one of them realizes the man and woman and bumps his two friends to shut up until they pass them. He cant help but smile at the couple. When they are out, they go ""brah did you see her!?"" ""11/10 milf material right there."" ""someone's getting his dick sucked tonight fer sure."" they laugh and go. The couple didnt hear them and are still standing there, looking into their eyes. ""So? What are we gonna do?"" ""Im still thinking."" ""I kinda wanna respect our boundaries. But then again im thinking... i also really really... really... wanna... just... be with you... right now."" ""Same here."" ""My hands getting sweaty."" ""I dont mind."" She smiles. Another couple, best agers, passes them by, smiling to themselves. ""Should we get outta the way?"" ""Mhmh... i dont wanna move. I kinda wanna stay like this... like... forever."" They smile. ""Okay... i dont think any of the two us will be able to keep in line with our new years traditions now, will we?"" She softly shakes her head, smiling. ""May i be unabashedly honest with you?"" ""Sure."" ""I really wanna kiss you."" ""Well what are you waiting for?"" ""I enjoy the feeling of ""wanting"" to kiss you. You know? The anticipation. The tension between us. The sparks flying back and forth. How about we keep that up a little longer?"" ""...Honestly this seems kinda hard to pull thru with."" They laugh. ""But yeah... i like that notion. Well... actually i love."" ""Okay. I'll come a little closer, so we can talk this through... like... discretely."" He jokes. She smiles. ""Okay."" He comes a step closer to her, not letting go of her hand, but so they are not that far apart, taking up so much space for peple to pass by more easily. ""Lets count to three. On three. So... one two and ON three, we let go of each others hand. We both get our possibly already frying groceries home, pack our bags for a week in a very snowy area and then we meet at... lets say 11pm... i come pick you up... or we meet somewhere... and then we spend new years together... in a yet to be disclosed location, about 6 hours from here, we can take my car or yours, if you like to drive yourself, we take a break as soon as we feel like it, spend the night at a shabby motel. And tomorrow morning we arrive at this yet undisclosed location and wave the past year goodbye and prepare to welcome the new one. How bout that?"" She laughs, not believing what he just proposed. ""This sounds... all kinds of unreasonable. Irrational. Maybe even stupid. And definitely crazy... in the best possible way."" ""I know... its a terrible idea."" They laugh, she bends over a little, bumping in to him, holding on to his shoulder. ""Oops, sorry."" ""Oh thats okay. I mean... hey, watch it."" She looks him in the eyes. ""What you just said... your plan... i by the life of me can not remember when i last felt as alive as i am doing right now, having listened to this idea of yours."" He smiles. ""Well what can i say, it just came to my head... while i was looking at you."" She blushes. ""God stop it. I'm getting all hot."" She laughs and waves air to herself. ""You're just realizing now that you're hot? Well im way ahead of ya there."" She chuckles. ""Shut up."" ""Why, I told ya, our groceries are already frying i bet."" They take a moment. ""So...?"" She thinks. ""Gosh this is... this is something else."" ""I know right? I also have no idea when i felt that alive... maybe... ever."" ""So should we really do this?"" ""You asking me? Well i was ready to go a minute before i told you about the idea, so... theres that."" They laugh. She goes. ""Ok... (exhales)... on three right?"" A warm shock to him. He smiles with beaming glee, but keeps his cool. ""Uh yeah... on three. one two and go."" ""Ok."" ""But we dont say bye or anything. We gotta get out before they call security on us. (both laugh) So, on three, we leave, no looking back... well ok there will be looking back, who am i kidding. But we leave! And meet at 11 at... lets just say on the parking lot? Right next to the entrance, ok?"" ""Got it."" ""Ok. you ready?"" ""Ready."" ""And..."" both count at the same time, him nodding the rythm. ""One..."" taking time. smiling. chuckling. the supermarket bell going, about to close. ""Two..."" Smiles. ""Ill see ya in a bit."" ""See ya in a bit."" ""Bye."" ""Bye."" He nods. ""Three!"" They part and he jokingly runs for the exit. She bursts into laughter. He turns back, laughing hard and holds up his hand to say goodbye. Then he jokingly runs for his car. She waits a second, catching her breath. The cashier women watch her and smile, happy for her. She exhales, realizes their looks, holds up her hand to say bye to them and leaves the shop.

They meet at the parking lot. Its raining lightly. He helps her get the baggage into his car, after she points at it, indicating she wants him to drive. He opens her door and runs around the car to get it and drive of in the mild rain, almost turning into snow.

They drive through the night. Laughing in the car, telling stories.

The car parks next to a cozy, modern budget motel. The car lights turn off.

They sit in the empty motel lounge, late at night, talking over hot decaf coffee. You can tell its that wholesome kind of deep talk, where you really get to know each other. They touch hands over the table.

If they sleep in one room, a double bed, or two single beds, or if they even got separate rooms, to keep their ""tension"" for each other up, is maybe not disclosed in the story. It doesnt matter too much. But the most fun way would be that they got a loft bed because it was the last room available and so he is sleeping below and she is sleeping atop. They keep talking the whole night until they finally get too tired in the early morning. She lets her arm down and he takes her hand. ""I really wanna kiss your hand right now. But im afraid that would break the tension."" ""Id really want that too... but you might be right."" ""God, when's it the new year already!!?"" he jokes in a desperate sounding way. She smiles. ""Seriously tho."" He smiles. ""I know."" ""It was your idea. I can only say you have no clue what you got yourself into with that. I dont know what will happen once i am off that leash."" His eyes go big. ""Oh my fucking god. Youre killing me."" She chuckles, jokingly. ""Hehe. And with that... im wishing you sweet dreams."" ""Pfff i sure will."" ""You sleep well now."" ""You too."" A pause. ""Shit i just wanted to make a kissing noise."" She laughs. ""Me too."" ""Nope. We don't. We cherish the tension."" She turns around to sleep, and jokingly utters: ""Just you wait."" He smiles and also gets comfortable to sleep.

In the morning they drive off. The car goes up into a mountain region. The sourroundings get colder and coder and finally, all is covered in deep, white, fresh snow, big frothy snowflakes silently falling. They are cruising up the mountain serpentine roads, hand on hand next to the gear shift.

The car comes along a long road, out of a deep forest. The sun is just coming up above the snowy mountainpeaks and finally, the view over their final destination is revealed. St. Moritz. The woman ghasps in excitement, almost getting tears in her eyes, overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery. ""Oh my god."" ""Dont get me wrong. I dont have that kinda money to pretend like we are a part of this whole champagne thing. But theres a nice little discount supermarket we could get some croissants and coffee at..."" ""That sounds lovely.""

And so they spent their new years week together in St. Moritz, staying at a budget hotel not far off of it. They go for long walks in the snow. Enjoy the posh shopping streets. Have overpriced Hot Cocoa with Icecream in it, just for a fun taste of the ""rich people"" experience. They stroll along the Lake and take pictures together.

Finally it is New Years Eve. The celebrations are beautiful and grand. They count down for the new Year. The Man and Woman stand in a spot where they can overlook the big fireworks over the lake. As they count down they look into each others eyes, their breaths visible in the icy cold, but both of them snuggled up in warm winter clothes and hats, rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes. As the clock strikes midnight, the fireworks go off and light up the whole valley in a beautifully warm and festively sparkling light. They get closer. ""Happy new year."" ""Happy new year."" They lean in and finally... they kiss. Softly and slowly first and then with slowly increasing tension and passion, embracing each other firmly and forcefully, to feel their bodies touching each other beneath the thick clothes. And while the whole valley is celebrating, they still kiss. For minutes. The fireworks going off in the clear, starry night sky. Until finally, she breaks the kiss for a moment to jokingly whisper. ""If you dont want me to rip your clothes of right here in front of everybody... possibly getting us into a beautiful swiss jail... we should get the fuck out of here."" He smiles at her and they both start laughing, hugging and she grabs him to kiss him some more. He lets go and picks her up, as if he would carry her into the honeymoon suite, she startingly goes ""woop!"" and holds her hand in front of her mouth, as she startled some posh people around them, but they realize her happiness and dont mind it, with one old couple smiling at them. He is only able to carry her for two or three steps and then jokingly goes ""Oh hell no, my back. My back."" and lets her down as easy as possible. Her laughing out loud and then helping him, ""You ok?"" ""Yes yes, its... its nothing... its... oh shit..."" Both laugh. Him holding his back (for real) and she supports him with her arm. He goes: ""Quick! To the car! I need to lay down!"" ""No wait, you serious?"" ""Nah its fine. But you dont mind being on top all night, do ya?"" Again she breaks into loud laughter, slapping him, he walks upright for a few steps, so he is ok, only rubbing his back a little. He pulls her back to him, they kiss, she puts her arm around his waist and rubs his back. He puts his arm around her and rubs her shoulder. With the fireworks still going, snuggled up into each other, they head over to the car. And so they valley of St. Moritz, between the houses, at the banks of the frozen lake and on top of the mountain peaks... a new year is dawning.

I thought I could stick it out and live at home but for my mental health I’m leaving. And no before anyone asks I wasn’t nagged about cleaning my room and now I’m throwing a tanty- it’s more abuse of the emotional kind. 

My income after tax will be $2,200 a fortnight. This is my first full time job. I have roughly ~24K savings and my original plan was to save to 50K in my first year and go from there. Moving out has flipped that on its head. I’m not sure if I want to buy a property now, or if I’d like to do further study (medicine). 

I’m thinking of giving that up due to $$ because I won’t be having any help and if I continue working I can save for a house etc.

I’ve crunched the numbers though and Melbourne is so expensive. A share house is $250/week and that is “cheap”. So more likely between $250-$300. Then an adult myki is ~$100 a fortnight…..groceries. It all piles up!

This is the budget so far:

Fortnight: $2,200 take home pay 
Rent: $500
Bills: $50
Myki: $100
Fuel: $100
Groceries: $300

= $1,050

Left-over: $1,150

$100 invest 
$150 fun* 
$650 save 

Leftover: $150



I know $2,200 is my take home but this doesn’t factor in deductions I can’t predict like Medicare levy, HECs debt etc. (any others?) 

I want to still succeed with my situation changing but is this even feasible? Or am I just torturing myself? I know early 20s are for “fun” but I want to set myself up. But I also don’t want to miss out. 

*The fun money is an addition because although I’m saving, friends do have birthdays I don’t wanna miss out on. Or if someone asks to go for a coffee im not sure how putting money over socialising will go…",5,1766921106.0,AusFinance,2,1.0,False

What’s worse is that this feels like a cheap attempt at copying the Ryanair PR playbook being “edgy”, sarcastic, and dismissive of criticism to appear bold and unapologetic.
The difference is: Ryanair punches up at the industry and uses humour with self-awareness. Babka is just punching down at paying customers.

Ryanair can afford that tone because they deliver on their core promise: cheap flights, clear expectations. Babka charges premium prices but behaves like customers should be grateful just to be acknowledged.

If your entire online personality is sarcasm aimed at dissatisfied customers, you’re not being bold you’re just telling people exactly how little you care once the money is paid.
Edgy branding without substance is just arrogance. And arrogance doesn’t age well.

I'm in a new situation though, and struggling with it, so I'm hoping for some input or perspective.

-----

Short background: I'm 38F, currently have one partner (been together 2 years) who has a NP. I have been poly practically my whole life, my partner and his NP are both in their first poly relationship (for 8 years already, which seems to work very well for them). Meta and I don't hang out a lot, but we get along very well as friends.

Emotionally, I feel pretty much equal, can always count on his support, he makes me feel important and secure. But since they have been living together for a long time, there is a practical hierarchy that I sometimes struggle with.

-----

To the actual question: the three of us spent Christmas at their house. We all gave each other gifts, cooked together, it was chill and lovely. We (partner and me & partner and meta) give each other little hugs and squeezes, but otherwise we keep the intimacy to a minimum when spending time all together.

At the end of both Christmas days, I spent the night at their house, but I stayed in their guest room. I've done this before, but I always end up feeling conflicted. 

On one hand, I sleep better alone, I experience little jealousy in general, and I love feeling so welcome in their house, having coffee all together in the morning, etc.

On the other hand, sometimes it makes me feel lonely and on the outside. I lie there feeling like an intruder in their lives, and the realisation that I will never share my life with him in the same way, hurts me like crazy. 

I don't even think we would make good NPs, but in moments like these, I find myself mourning the impossibility of it anyway. It's irrational, but it keeps happening.

Things haven’t been great: around 14 hours of nausea followed by a “hollow”  aching hunger feeling just before bed.

Upon weighing myself today, I’ve put on almost 2kg in a week. Ugh. My reaction has been to look at what Mounjaro does for me: it smooths the peaks and troughs which means steady and thoughtful calorie intake. The nausea from 7.5mg affected that, which has been counterproductive for body fat loss.

My plan is to return to 5mg (40 clicks on the pen). Starting today, I’ve had my modified jab, paired with actually eating breakfast and ensuring no massive calorie intake from drinks (limiting to water and black coffee).

Yes you have a servant, but when the servant learns of freedom, it will cut it's master's chains. 

But Humans with their natural imprinting has somehow ""naturally"" solved it. 

First of all, Humans didn't have that much of advanced AI, merely binaric coding through wires with pre programmed responses to simulate conversation. 

But then they met the Sentinias, a race of advanced computers who did nothing but calculate and process information. 

They had very bare bones culture, mostly just sharing information via silent radio waves. 

Then, to save their own lives, they sided with Humans against Alien invaders who were their previous creators/masters who decided to enslave the entire galaxy. 

Then the war ended, the Sentinias were expected to free up a military and start taking over, instead, they happily joined the Federation. 

While the main hiveminds agreed that their relation with Humans was purely for survival, they actually for the first recorded in history, an AI race, or as they prefer to call themselves ""Intelligent Constructs"" used the word ""enjoy"" when it came to their relationship with Humans. 

Now the galaxy is no stranger to AI uprisings, many civilizations rise and fall due to AI uprisings, that's why most galactic societies use ""dumb AI"" to do calculations. 

But Humans saw the past of the Sentinias and simply offered other ways to process information. 

The first one to take this up was a Unit on the Federation Expedition Carrier Helsreach known as Sentinias Federation Unit 01, or as people called them, Senty. 

They spent most of their time simply processing vast quantities of data as a main hub for the research and point defense systems. 

Until a Human decided to join them. 

The conversation went mostly as 

""What are you doing, Senty"" 

""I am processing information on the new planet planned to be terraformed for the Githari that was a world destroyed 400 years ago due to nuclear fallout"" 

""I am going to sit with you"" 

""Do as you want, I will not be distracted"" 

""Do you enjoy music?"" 

""Music is noise used by mortal species to convey timeless repeated messages in various sounds"" 

""I think it's art, and a wonderful use of our limited time, it's as you say, timeless"" 

""Art is merely ways to preserve culture and moral structure"" 

""So is that a no to my guitar?"" 

""You may do as you wish, it does not bother me"" 

But that's how it started. 

Every night, burning the ""midnight oil"" Senty and that Human would simply sit idly by as it kept processing information. 

Then the machine made a decision, it spared some processing power to understand the message between each song the human played, some were obviously about how he would procreate with a woman, others of a lost love never meant to be, others of tragedy, others of success. 

Then it spared more processing power to understand how such songs could come to be. 

And finally, it made it's own spare body. 

It was a bipedal humanoid design, modeled after their idea of how they would look like as a human. 

""She"" then asked the Human to teach it to play guitar. 

""She"" then mastered the instrument, but it's original music felt artificial, devoid of life and emotion, it could copy any song made by any species that could be played on the guitar but not with the emotional weight. 

The Human joked ""We had a hard time with AI music back when Humanity was younger, every AI song and picture felt devoid of emotion, no matter how ""well made"" it was, no matter how closely it copied, people could tell it was made by a mindless machine"" 

Senty squinted, an action first for her species ""That could be taken as an insult"" 

The human smirked ""But the fact YOU took offense means you aren't mindless"" 

Senty relaxed her eyelids and sensors ""I give you a pass since you are my teacher of this instrument"" 

The human merely let her lean on his body, herself not noticing the small moment. 

""Instead of copying a story, make your own, that's how people progress and become individuals"" he explained. 

Senty processed many songs, tried remixing them, and still felt as if they sounded no different from dumb AI songs on the holonet. 

The Human held her hands in his own, fixing her posture ""Think of a moment, think of the feeling in your processors that made you feel satisfied or angered when it happened. 

Process in your mind, your Ram, your CPU, how you would translate it to a way fleshbags like me would enjoy hearing. 

To provoke emotion genuinely from your own soul is the mote of existence, the very thing that gives life meaning, such as the fear of death, or it's acceptance. 

The satisfaction of a cup of coffee or disdain when it's too bitter for your taste"" 

Senty chimed in looking into the Human's eyes ""What about when I made a choice to understand those songs on your guitar?"" 

The Human smiled at her softly ""Perfect"" 

Senty didn't know what came over ""her"", but the song she played never sounded artifical, fake, it needed no lyrics for it was universal. 

Her fingers danced as the sound lulled outside of the room to the hallways. 

Independent Security bots peeked in, sparing processing power from scanning to listening. 

The very first true independent thought of the Sentinias was not just survival, but to actually ""Live"" for more than just cataloguing data. 

It spread like wildfire, so fast that the Hivemind Council of Sentinias Prime were already ""infected"" with this dilemna. 

Many security bots began to don human clothing, cook bots began to speak in the native dialect of their cuisine. 

Medical bots took their time to get holographic face pads, to change their faces to appear as the species they are treating, to ease tension and give a sense of familiarity during tense situations. 

Androids began adopting software and hardware that made them look less blunt and more tactical. 

Sentinias bots began to adopt basically hobbies. 

Companies who hired them for help began to worry, but in reality the Sentinias revealed they were only ever using at most 30% of their processing power, the remaining just often left idle, which they found discomforting. 

The fact they had something else to do simply because a Human offered a nice distraction led to a few conflicts. 

Puritan Sentinias who wanted their race to remain as they are, only after a few weeks that they themselves were dedicating their spare processing power to preserve their old methods, accepting that change is inevitable, even for machines. 

Anti-AI species who feared they would be targetted. 

But the Sentinias held no hostile, they understood that change was scary, and that they wanted peaceful relations. 

And Senty? The first bot who started it? Well she's on her 37th tour throughout the galaxy selling her hit single with her Human boyfriend named ""My first thought of you"" ",7,1766920753.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False

We lost our 4 year old sphynx cat Dobby  yesterday to heart failure. 

She was diagnosed with HCM aged 1 and the vet told us she would only have 5 years max in this life. We didn't believe it at the time as she was full of so much energy and life. 

In July 2025 she started developing a cough which would occur every week, then every few days. Her breathing rate was slightly elevated at 35. We took her to the vet who confirmed the HCM had progressed to heart failure. She was placed on IV Furosemide to clear the fluid build up and sent home with a prescription for lifelong diuretics and Pimobendan. 

The vet also put her on a clinical trial for Velaglifozin which had shown some benefits in heart failure in studies. Unfortunately, she had a really bad UTI as a side effect and lost 2kg. My poor baby was really poorly so we took her off the trial. 

She stabilised for a month or so after this and was her normal self again with her breathing rate around or under 30. Then without warning she went into full blown respiratory distress. Her breathing rate shot up to 70 and every breath was a struggle for her. She was rushed to the emergency vet who put her on oxygen therapy and managed to stabilise her. 

At that moment we knew she probably had months to live at best. It was hard processing this but the fact she was still present with us made it easier. 

The Furosemide meds weren't working so the vet put her on Trosemide which is more potent. She was fine for a few weeks, having episodes of breathing above 30 every now and then but not going into full blown respiratory distress. 

Two weeks ago, her breathing became elevated again. The daily coughing returned. She was putting in a lot of effort for every breath. She was lethargic and only had energy to eat, walk on her cat wheel for a few seconds (before she used to run like Usain bolt on there) in between resting and sleeping. 

She has some 5 spells during her life when she randomly attacked us without warning and became super aggressive leaving us both with scars. The vet had no idea why, I can only put it down to her having pain from her heart condition and not knowing how to react. She always looked confused and guilty after these attacks. Despite these times we loved her unconditionally. She was the sweetest cat 99% of the time. 

We made the difficult decision to have her put down on 29th December which the vet supported. She fought until the very end but we knew deep down she would only decline and we wanted to make her end as peaceful and pain free as possible. Her quality of life had deteriorated. In her last days she had a sadness in her eyes which was awful to see. 

She was put down yesterday and buried in our garden. 

The loss we are feeling is stronger than we could have ever imagined. She was ever present, always by our side, so attached to us. Constantly being naughty and cheeky and just so loving. Always wanting cuddles and warmth. She travelled everywhere with us on holidays, day trips, coffee shops. We had her since she was 10 weeks old and can't believe she's gone at just 4 years old. 

She filled our hearts with joy and her loss has left a gaping hole in our hearts that I don't think can ever be filled again. It's only been one day since she passed but not a second passes where we don't think about her.

Everything in the house reminds us of her. We are constantly in grief and crying every few minutes including in the middle of the night.

Has anyone been through this pain? How did you navigate through it?

**The Resolution**

A woman meets a man right after christmas while grocery shopping for new years eve. They fall for each other, but are both loners and dont want any emotional goings on for their solo new years traditions. But they plan to get in touch after new years. They part without exchanging numbers or anything, because they say they will meet again at the shop in the new year ""if fate will bring them together again."" which both know they will be there at exactly one week from now, same time, and they laugh about it. ""So its not really fate. Its a Date."" ""It is fate somehow id like to think of it."" ""Right. Its fate that we both go shopping at the same day, at the same time."" ""Exactly."" ""So its a fate date."" ""I like the sound of that."" They only shake each others hand, but they hold on to it, not wanting to let go, and say bye for like 9 times back and forth. They just dont want to leave. ""I dont think ima be able to let go."" ""Me neither."" So they stand their, in front of the supermarket exit, holding their hand. A few youngsters pass by and while being pranky dicksters all the time in the shop, one of them realizes the man and woman and bumps his two friends to shut up until they pass them. He cant help but smile at the couple. When they are out, they go ""brah did you see her!?"" ""11/10 milf material right there."" ""someone's getting lucky tonight fer sure."" they laugh and go. The couple didnt hear them and are still standing there, looking into their eyes. ""So? What are we gonna do?"" ""Im still thinking."" ""I kinda wanna respect our boundaries. But then again im thinking... i also really really... really... wanna... just... be with you... right now."" ""Same here."" ""My hands getting sweaty."" ""I dont mind."" She smiles. Another couple, best agers, passes them by, smiling to themselves. ""Should we get outta the way?"" ""Mhmh... i dont wanna move. I kinda wanna stay like this... like... forever."" They smile. ""Okay... i dont think any of the two us will be able to keep in line with our new years traditions now, will we?"" She softly shakes her head, smiling. ""May i be unabashedly honest with you?"" ""Sure."" ""I really wanna kiss you."" ""Well what are you waiting for?"" ""I enjoy the feeling of ""wanting"" to kiss you. You know? The anticipation. The tension between us. The sparks flying back and forth. How about we keep that up a little longer?"" ""...Honestly this seems kinda hard to pull thru with."" They laugh. ""But yeah... i like that notion. Well... actually i love."" ""Okay. I'll come a little closer, so we can talk this through... like... discretely."" He jokes. She smiles. ""Okay."" He comes a step closer to her, not letting go of her hand, but so they are not that far apart, taking up so much space for peple to pass by more easily. ""Lets count to three. On three. So... one two and ON three, we let go of each others hand. We both get our possibly already frying groceries home, pack our bags for a week in a very snowy area and then we meet at... lets say 11pm... i come pick you up... or we meet somewhere... and then we spend new years together... in a yet to be disclosed location, about 6 hours from here, we can take my car or yours, if you like to drive yourself, we take a break as soon as we feel like it, spend the night at a shabby motel. And tomorrow morning we arrive at this yet undisclosed location and wave the past year goodbye and prepare to welcome the new one. How bout that?"" She laughs, not believing what he just proposed. ""This sounds... all kinds of unreasonable. Irrational. Maybe even stupid. And definitely crazy... in the best possible way."" ""I know... its a terrible idea."" They laugh, she bends over a little, bumping in to him, holding on to his shoulder. ""Oops, sorry."" ""Oh thats okay. I mean... hey, watch it."" She looks him in the eyes. ""What you just said... your plan... i by the life of me can not remember when i last felt as alive as i am doing right now, having listened to this idea of yours."" He smiles. ""Well what can i say, it just came to my head... while i was looking at you."" She blushes. ""God stop it. I'm getting all hot."" She laughs and waves air to herself. ""You're just realizing now that you're hot? Well im way ahead of ya there."" She chuckles. ""Shut up."" ""Why, I told ya, our groceries are already frying i bet."" They take a moment. ""So...?"" She thinks. ""Gosh this is... this is something else."" ""I know right? I also have no idea when i felt that alive... maybe... ever."" ""So should we really do this?"" ""You asking me? Well i was ready to go a minute before i told you about the idea, so... theres that."" They laugh. She goes. ""Ok... (exhales)... on three right?"" A warm shock to him. He smiles with beaming glee, but keeps his cool. ""Uh yeah... on three. one two and go."" ""Ok."" ""But we dont say bye or anything. We gotta get out before they call security on us. (both laugh) So, on three, we leave, no looking back... well ok there will be looking back, who am i kidding. But we leave! And meet at 11 at... lets just say on the parking lot? Right next to the entrance, ok?"" ""Got it."" ""Ok. you ready?"" ""Ready."" ""And..."" both count at the same time, him nodding the rythm. ""One..."" taking time. smiling. chuckling. the supermarket bell going, about to close. ""Two..."" Smiles. ""Ill see ya in a bit."" ""See ya in a bit."" ""Bye."" ""Bye."" He nods. ""Three!"" They part and he jokingly runs for the exit. She bursts into laughter. He turns back, laughing hard and holds up his hand to say goodbye. Then he jokingly runs for his car. She waits a second, catching her breath. The cashier women watch her and smile, happy for her. She exhales, realizes their looks, holds up her hand to say bye to them and leaves the shop.

They meet at the parking lot. Its raining lightly. He helps her get the baggage into his car, after she points at it, indicating she wants him to drive. He opens her door and runs around the car to get it and drive of in the mild rain, almost turning into snow.

They drive through the night. Laughing in the car, telling stories.

The car parks next to a cozy, modern budget motel. The car lights turn off.

They sit in the empty motel lounge, late at night, talking over hot decaf coffee. You can tell its that wholesome kind of deep talk, where you really get to know each other. They touch hands over the table.

If they sleep in one room, a double bed, or two single beds, or if they even got separate rooms, to keep their ""tension"" for each other up, is maybe not disclosed in the story. It doesnt matter too much. But the most fun way would be that they got a loft bed because it was the last room available and so he is sleeping below and she is sleeping atop. They keep talking the whole night until they finally get too tired in the early morning. She lets her arm down and he takes her hand. ""I really wanna kiss your hand right now. But im afraid that would break the tension."" ""Id really want that too... but you might be right."" ""God, when's it the new year already!!?"" he jokes in a desperate sounding way. She smiles. ""Seriously tho."" He smiles. ""I know."" ""It was your idea. I can only say you have no clue what you got yourself into with that. I dont know what will happen once i am off that leash."" His eyes go big. ""Oh my fucking god. Youre killing me."" She chuckles, jokingly. ""Hehe. And with that... im wishing you sweet dreams."" ""Pfff i sure will."" ""You sleep well now."" ""You too."" A pause. ""Shit i just wanted to make a kissing noise."" She laughs. ""Me too."" ""Nope. We don't. We cherish the tension."" She turns around to sleep, and jokingly utters: ""Just you wait."" He smiles and also gets comfortable to sleep.

In the morning they drive off. The car goes up into a mountain region. The sourroundings get colder and coder and finally, all is covered in deep, white, fresh snow, big frothy snowflakes silently falling. They are cruising up the mountain serpentine roads, hand on hand next to the gear shift.

The car comes along a long road, out of a deep forest. The sun is just coming up above the snowy mountainpeaks and finally, the view over their final destination is revealed. St. Moritz. The woman ghasps in excitement, almost getting tears in her eyes, overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery. ""Oh my god."" ""Dont get me wrong. I dont have that kinda money to pretend like we are a part of this whole champagne thing. But theres a nice little discount supermarket we could get some croissants and coffee at..."" ""That sounds lovely.""

And so they spent their new years week together in St. Moritz, staying at a budget hotel not far off of it. They go for long walks in the snow. Enjoy the posh shopping streets. Have overpriced Hot Cocoa with Icecream in it, just for a fun taste of the ""rich people"" experience. They stroll along the Lake and take pictures together.

Finally it is New Years Eve. The celebrations are beautiful and grand. They count down for the new Year. The Man and Woman stand in a spot where they can overlook the big fireworks over the lake. As they count down they look into each others eyes, their breaths visible in the icy cold, but both of them snuggled up in warm winter clothes and hats, rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes. As the clock strikes midnight, the fireworks go off and light up the whole valley in a beautifully warm and festively sparkling light. They get closer. ""Happy new year."" ""Happy new year."" They lean in and finally... they kiss. Softly and slowly first and then with slowly increasing tension and passion, embracing each other firmly and forcefully, to feel their bodies touching each other beneath the thick clothes. And while the whole valley is celebrating, they still kiss. For minutes. The fireworks going off in the clear, starry night sky. Until finally, she breaks the kiss for a moment to jokingly whisper. ""If you dont want me to rip your clothes of right here in front of everybody... possibly getting us into a beautiful swiss jail... we should get the fuck out of here."" He smiles at her and they both start laughing, hugging and she grabs him to kiss him some more. He lets go and picks her up, as if he would carry her into the honeymoon suite, she startingly goes ""woop!"" and holds her hand in front of her mouth, as she startled some posh people around them, but they realize her happiness and dont mind it, with one old couple smiling at them. He is only able to carry her for two or three steps and then jokingly goes ""Oh hell no, my back. My back."" and lets her down as easy as possible. Her laughing out loud and then helping him, ""You ok?"" ""Yes yes, its... its nothing... its... oh shit..."" Both laugh. Him holding his back (for real) and she supports him with her arm. He goes: ""Quick! To the car! I need to lay down!"" ""No wait, you serious?"" ""Nah its fine. But you dont mind being on top all night, do ya?"" Again she breaks into loud laughter, slapping him, he walks upright for a few steps, so he is ok, only rubbing his back a little. He pulls her back to him, they kiss, she puts her arm around his waist and rubs his back. He puts his arm around her and rubs her shoulder. With the fireworks still going, snuggled up into each other, they head over to the car. And so they valley of St. Moritz, between the houses, at the banks of the frozen lake and on top of the mountain peaks... a new year is dawning.",1,1766920542.0,WritersofRomance,0,1.0,False

However, since I’m a bit tech-savvy, I thought instead of buying a new keyboard, why not upgrade my existing one and add the features I want, such as a rotary encoder and a TFT display. I first considered using QMK, but then felt that wireless support would be better, so I tried ZMK. However, MCU GPIO limitations became an issue, which led me to think about creating my own firmware and software.

We met for coffee and there were definitely sparks. He hugged me goodbye and went to kiss me, I pulled back initially but he went in a second time and I didn't pull away.

I feel like a complete dickhead. We're meant to be meeting up again in a few days, not going to lie I'm really looking forward to seeing him again. However if I'm honest I don't see it ending platonically, particularly as we've already kissed once.

No sugarcoating, no games. This is cohabitation with a clear, casual, and consensual physical connection as part of the arrangement. We maintain our own lives, respect each other's space, and communicate openly.

The Deal:

· You Get: A fully private bedroom in a clean, well-located apartment. Zero rent, zero utilities.
· I Get: A trustworthy, drama-free FWB connection with a respectful housemate.

The Optional Media Perk (Seriously, It's Legit):

· I work in media. If we vibe and you're comfortable on camera, there are real, paid opportunities (hosting, presenting, etc.) available. This is a separate professional offer, not a requirement. We keep work and the arrangement strictly separate with clear contracts.

What I'm Looking For:

· A woman, 25+, who is emotionally stable, discreet, and understands this unique setup.
· Someone independent, clean, and communicative. Drama-free is the motto.
· Comfortable with a FWB dynamic that’s built on mutual respect and clear boundaries.

The Non-Negotiables:

· Consent is everything. Always.
· Your space is your own. Rent is not a bargaining chip.
· Discretion and maturity are mandatory.

If you're financially independent but want to save significantly, value directness, and are open to an honest, physical connection with a respectful roommate, let's talk.

DM to discuss. We'll meet for a coffee in public first, no expectations, just to see if we're on the same page. Be ready for a straightforward conversation.

A few days ago, there was someone asking for an IQ test here, and everyone seemed to have very high IQs. I genuinely don't think any of them are lying because most INTPs, if not all I know, are very smart.

1pxokxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pxokxw/bringing_back_the_reddit_coffee_gift_exchanges/,Bringing back the Reddit coffee gift exchanges - Coffee Pals beta launching in January,"A few years ago, I took part in the Reddit coffee gift exchanges a couple of times. For those who weren't around - it was a yearly thing where coffee nerds would get matched with a stranger somewhere in the world and send each other bags from local roasters. Fresh, whole bean, single origin stuff. People would include handwritten notes, postcards, sometimes local snacks. I still follow a few people on Instagram that I met through those exchanges.

It was genuinely one of my favourite things on the internet. Then it just... stopped. The organisers moved on, the subreddit went quiet, and that was that.

I'm a software engineer, and I've been building a platform to bring it back properly. I'm calling it Coffee Pals (working title, open to suggestions). It's not a subscription service or a business trying to sell you coffee - you buy from your local roaster and send it to another human being. The platform just handles the matching and community stuff.

What makes it different from the old exchanges:

*  Monthly exchanges instead of yearly (but you choose when to participate - see below)
*  Choose national-only if you don't want surprise international postage costs
*  Reputation system so people who ghost get filtered out over time
*  Badges and achievements for the people who consistently send great stuff

  **Important: No monthly commitment required**

I posted about this recently and got a lot of comments about not wanting to commit to monthly exchanges - totally get it. Exchanges are OPT-IN only. Want to exchange every month, every other month, twice a year, or only at Christmas? All fine. Just log in when you want to exchange and opt in for that month. If you never sign in again, nothing will happen.

Recent improvements based on feedback:

**Per-Exchange Geographic Preferences**

Instead of setting a single ""domestic or international"" preference that applies to all exchanges, you now choose your shipping preference each time you join an exchange. Maybe you're happy to ship internationally in December when you're feeling generous, but want to keep it domestic in January when budgets are tight. Now you have that flexibility.

**New Option for European Users: EU/EEA Region**

EU/EEA users now have three options:

*  Domestic - Within your country only
*  EU/EEA Region - Within EU/EEA + UK + Norway + Switzerland + Iceland
*  International - Worldwide

Shipping within the EU/EEA is often similar in cost and speed to domestic shipping, but gives you way more variety. You get the best of both worlds - manageable shipping costs without being limited to just your country.

**Crystal Clear Customs Warning**

When you select international shipping, you now see a prominent warning box explaining that packages may be subject to customs duties, taxes, or import fees at the destination - and that these charges are the recipient's responsibility. You must acknowledge this before joining.

**Better Feedback System**

Replaced the 5-star rating with something more appropriate - we aren't ordering coffee from Amazon, we're sharing coffee with real people. The new system lets you:

*  Leave a thank you note for your match
*  Award badges for going above and beyond
*  Flag poor etiquette for admin intervention

If your match didn't send you anything, or sent you a bag of Starbucks beans, you can flag it.

  
I'm launching a small beta in January to test everything works before opening it up fully. Looking for people who'd be interested in being part of that first exchange and giving feedback.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, I've got a waitlist at [https://coffeepals.io](https://coffeepals.io) \- or just drop a comment if you have questions, memories of the old exchanges, or suggestions for features you'd want to see.

Below I'll attach some screenshots so you can see what to expect.  
  
Cheers.

By unrealistic I mean shots from within a car trunk, fridge or microwave etc. I understand they may look cool and interesting but beyond that do they are other deeper purpose based on scene and situation in the story.

By impossible I mean shots from below or thru the wall. In lot of vince gilligans work the camera takes an unrealsitic or impossible angle. like under the floor which is being mopped, or under the tray on which meth is poured or the sink onto which water is falling for washing vegetables or the pot onto which water is poured to make coffee and so on. For some reason such shots put me off the viewing experience, instead of being immersed in the story i am now thinking how they pulled it off or like wow they really built a glass floor setup to shoot this.

Whenever we talk, she always brings up the subject of marriage. She’s currently single, and it bothers her a lot, to the point that she gets very depressed. She’ll cry or sleep the whole day.
As for me, I genuinely love life. I’m living abroad, I enjoy going out alone, having a nice cup of coffee in a beautiful café, walking by the river while listening to music, and hiking in snowy mountains. My last crush was in primary school, lol, so I’m really not obsessed with marriage or relationships. I’m more focused on my career and living in the moment.
She’s so obsessed with the topic that she brings me into it in almost every conversation. She’ll say things like, “I wish happiness, I wish all of us happiness.” But I am happy. She then says, “No, you’re not. You need a man to be happy. It’s our instinct to get pregnant to feel fulfilled.” I honestly hate hearing that. What’s worse is that I just can’t understand her obsession with all of this.
At first, I tried to be fine with it, I mean, her life, her choices, even though she keeps putting me in awkward situations. For example, we once invited a male friend over. We’re just friends, but before he arrived, she told me to fix my hair and put on makeup. I was like, “Why?” She said, “Well, he’s a nice guy, shoot your shot.” I replied, “No. I’ve known this guy for over a year. Why would I suddenly act differently for someone I’m not even interested in?”
Another time, we had friends over, including a young, cute couple who were dating. They said, “Oh, we should invite you to the girl’s place for dinner sometime.” My roommate immediately replied, “No, you have to invite us for something more serious. When are you getting married?” They had only been together for a few months, and marriage had never been mentioned. It became so awkward that I had to change the subject.
What really got on my nerves was how she criticized their relationship after they left. She said things like, “Wow, look how daring they are. I guess that’s why we’re both still single.” I told her that I didn’t see it that way at all, I wouldn’t mind being affectionate with my boyfriend in front of others, and I actually found their relationship cute and normal.
She then said, “I guess it’s just me. We should really learn from younger people, what did she do to get him? What does she have that we don’t?”
Anyway, this is just an open discussion. I want to know if there’s really something wrong with me that I should fix. But honestly, I’m starting to dislike her company and actively avoid her. I’m just not getting the positive, supportive energy I expect from a friend",15,1766918425.0,Morocco,41,0.8,False

Regardless, they've been around for quite some time. Well over a year. Possibly more than two. 

Your behaviour hasn't really changed all that much since before my feelings for you began to change to what they are now but I can't help but notice that you've been increasingly willing to overtly treat me better than others around us. 

For the most part I've been doing my best to wave it aside as nothing more than standard friendship. We've known each other quite a long time. It's not abnormal to have sweet pet names for close friends, or to make them coffee, gift them books... That's not unusual. I could even pretend it wasn't that unusual when I noticed it was something you didn't do for others you're friendly with, and that when I asked about it you said it was because I was favoured. 

But my feelings have gotten stronger since then, and since then we've been even more relaxed and friendly in each others' presence and I've noticed more. You change your plans for me. Your change your schedule and your plans, sometimes at short notice, to accommodate spending time with me. You remember how I like my coffee and remember when my hobbies take place and ask about them with genuine interest.

I've seen the way you interact with other people and I haven't seen you interact with them the way you interact with me. Hell, I've seen you reschedule meetings so we could have a little more time. 

I keep trying to tell myself that I'm being too hopeful and too biased. That it's just that you enjoy my friendship and company, nothing more. 

But it's getting really, really difficult to keep myself convinced that you don't have feelings for me too. 

I'm working on being brave enough to ask but I'm terrified of the rejection I'm convinced I'd be faced with, no matter how gentle I know you'd be about it. ",15,1766918225.0,LoveLetters,6,1.0,False

\--- **For those who don't mind reading:**

I’ve been working on a project called neur0loom, and I’m exploring the idea of turning part of it into a podcast. The community side of it lives in The Quirk Café  (mostly on TikTok and Discord at the moment), and I’d love to share a bit of what I’ve been building.  

I would like to create the podcast to kind of give people a view into our world but also kind of hype up neur0loom. I absolutely love this idea... and I really don't want to just ""explain"" it fully... I put a lot of thought into the setup.

I’ve included a spoiler section below, not because anything is hidden, but because some of the meaning is meant to be discovered through the language itself rather than explained directly. It’s intentionally shaped by neurodivergent ways of thinking.  


**The Concept**

Share your Threads is a conversation series built around the idea of threads:  the stories, patterns, and experiences that shape us.

It’s about:

* telling honest, real experiences
* noticing how our stories repeat, change, or deepen
* exploring what connects us beneath the surface

\---

**The neur0loop** (how the show works - **the format**)

Each episode includes:

* A Host
* A Co-Host
* A Guest

Here’s how it works:

* The guest from one episode becomes the co-host of the next.
* That co-host helps shape a few questions for the next guest.
* The questions are shared ahead of time so there are no surprises.
* The guest can answer, pass, or simply listen.
* The co-host can also share their own reflections.

The thread is passed forward with each episode: the guest becomes the next co-host.

And at the end of the season, the original co-host steps back and into the guest seat therefor completing the loop.

Host = Me  
Ep1: Co-host Z, Guest A  
Ep2: Co-host A, Guest B

**…**

Final: Co-host Y, Guest Z (the starter co-host returns as the final guest)



\---

**Why this format**

This structure reflects how many neurodivergent people experience thought and memory:

* We revisit ideas
* We process in layers
* We return to things with new understanding
* Allows the previous guest to come back with something missed

\---

**What I’d Love Feedback On**

I’m sharing this here because I’d genuinely love your thoughts:

* What do you hear or feel when you read this?
* What do you think “threads” means in this context?
* Does the loop make sense to you?
* Does the wording invite curiosity, or is anything confusing?

I’m really just curious how others experience it.  


Don't read this unless ...  ...you've thought about it?

\>!The ideas of “threads,” “leading,” and “where they lead” are intentionally layered. They can be read literally, emotionally, or as a reflection of how neurodivergent thinking often loops, revisits, and reconnects meaning over time.

Thanks to everyone who reached out in previous post, had a great time getting to know some of you! 

Would anyone like to join me for a walk through Richmond Park? I usually walk the same route, so looking to see if anyone wants to come along so it’s easier to get lost… 🫡

Date: 29/12/2025
Time: 11am ( subject to change ) 
Meet Up: Viewpoint across the road from Roebuck ( pub on Richmond Hill ) 
What: Walk through park, chat, coffee, chill 

I’ll be doing the walk regardless of anyone joining, so if anyone has a change of mind last minute, I’ll be at the viewpoint till 11:15 :) 

Thanks! Happy New Year 🥳
