To give you some background, we met online in 2017. I was living in the UK, and she was in Australia. We spent years talking and FaceTiming, and in 2023, I traveled to Australia to meet her in person. We had both realized we liked each other before my arrival, so we became a couple right away. We started planning for me to move there through a partner visa, and everything felt magical, just like I had hoped.

However, something has felt off in my gut the entire time. Even though I‚Äôm still in Australia, I struggle to enjoy it here. We‚Äôve gone on road trips and traveled to different states, but I still feel the same way‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like it here.

I‚Äôm also having a hard time with my girlfriend. She has a traumatic past due to abuse and is autistic. Sometimes, I find it difficult to live with her; she‚Äôs messy, disorganized, and doesn‚Äôt have the best hygiene. I‚Äôve talked to her about this multiple times‚Äîat least 3 times a month‚Äîbut while she promises to improve, she never does. She also tends to expect me to handle all the responsibilities, like buying our car, servicing and selling it, setting up and paying bills, booking things, tech stuff, building furniture. There‚Äôs so much I could list. She works part-time in a restaurant and often complains about being tired. Just the other day, she came home from a 3 hour shift and started crying when I asked her if she could do the dishes from two nights ago that she was supposed to do.

It‚Äôs just small things all. the. time. I‚Äôm constantly cleaning up after her, she makes coffee in the morning, I‚Äôm the one cleaning all the spilt coffee and sugar up. I bought a new washing machine for us and she leaves wet clothes inside it, she never cleaned the kitchen, she never offers to do anything.
We hardly ever have sex, I try to initiate it and she just brushes me off and says she‚Äôs tired or she just does the smallest thing without any passion and thinks it‚Äôs enough. I just want to feel wanted and looked after too and for someone to actually want to do stuff for me.

I feel angry all the time, and nothing seems to make me happy here. I gave up everything to come to Australia, as I had this whole plan in my head. My upbringing hasn‚Äôt been the best, but I want to work for a better future, and I‚Äôm not sure if I can envision her in it. It‚Äôs exhausting.

I love her, which makes it even harder for me to consider leaving her, but being around her has become tiring to the point where I find myself looking forward to when she goes to work just so I can have a chance to breathe.

What should I do? If I do break up with her idk what I will do next. ",1,1737958510.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

Took two Lyft rides. But charges are present on my Chase statement, plus a charge for ~$40 that is reversed and another charge for ~$50 that stuck. The difference is the tip amount I authorized. 

Separately, I have receipts from Square for 3 separate unique orders from a coffee shop. One of those orders is legit. Only that order is present on my Chase statement.

Literally every single day for the past 7 years, I had a constant burning sensation in my stomach and sometimes my esophagus. Acidic/fibrous foods like apples, uncooked vegetables, coffee etc would wreck havoc on my stomach and render me bedridden. I would take PPIs like pantaprazole and TUMS but they would only give me relief for a few hours to a few days at best. I tried and spent hundreds of dollars on multiple supplements like zinc l carnosine, mastic gum, l glutamine etc etc and they would at best marginally help.

A few weeks ago, I started taking bio-fisetin, a supposedly more bioavailable form of fisetin which is a supplement intended to remove senescent cells  (at the time it was unrelated to digestive problems and more so for neurological enhancement), I took quite a lot of it over a very short period of time, much much more than I was supposed to, and a few days into it,  my gastritis symptoms completely stopped and  my previous high acidity seems to have reversed into low stomach (hypochloridria) and constipation.  My stomach has done a complete 180 from feeling horrible and sour all the time 24/7 for years to having virtually zero sensation and it's taken me aback. The reason I suspect I have hypochloridria is because I'm starting to have joint pain and anemia like symptoms.

Is it plausible that I accidentally damaged my stomach's parietal cells through the high doses of fisetin?",2,1737958283.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been trying for a baby for the last few months and it‚Äôs finally happened. We‚Äôre both delighted. However..

Back during the separation she got a job in our hometown while she was staying back there. Until she can transfer to a store up where we now live together, she still has to commute 2 hours to work from Sunday-Tuesday and doesn‚Äôt get back til Tuesdays at about midnight.

I guess that‚Äôs probably to be expected though. We don‚Äôt text much since we see eachother in person a lot more now that we‚Äôre back to living together, but it‚Äôs been a while since she‚Äôs messaged me saying something as simple as ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô and I‚Äôve noticed it recently. 

She‚Äôs also recently mentioned a new guy friend from work, which I was fine with because she ‚Äòdeclared it‚Äô if you will and didn‚Äôt try to hide it at all.

1ib1e1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1ib1e1r/hear_me_out/,Hear me out:,"A game where the premise is 'Sonic is Missing,' except he actually stays gone until the very end. 

The combat is Frontiers with better telegraphing, and there is no Cyloop. The stage design is like the Adventure games. 

The stories are Silver, Tails, Shadow, and Final.

The gimmick stages have Silver handling waves of enemies, but for a regular level amount of time. The idea of the Werehog stages were cool but they went on for way too long.

Tails piloting the Cyclone in duels against some E-100 series robots Eggman pulled out of whatever locked rooms he kept them in because there's 22 we haven't seen yet, and they can get really creative. (what would an E-100 optimized for air combat be like?)

And Shadow driving the Dark Rider for a bit of Boost gameplay because I like that bike.



Plot: Forces but with good writing. Sonic has been imprisoned in null space and this time Gadget isn't there for them to double boost out in one level. Infinite's back, but he's changed somewhat. He's not the raging edgelord he was in Forces. Eggman's pulled out all the stops, went over all of his notes, and is actually learning from his mistakes. The resistance actually does something by itself, and the writers allow it to work. Infinite only fights each hero once, and the heroes lose each time. The Final story has them all team up to put a stop to him and Dr. Eggman.

Fighting Styles:  
Tails' fighting style would be more focused on his gadgets.

Silver would throw enemies into each other, stuff at enemies, and enemies at stuff.

Shadow fights like it's a babies' first DMC game, but with classic sonic moves and chaos spears. I don't know whether or not he should get the Shadow Rifle back or if Shadow with a gun should stay in 2005. (I thought it was cool in the movie.)

Stories/Arcs  
Silver's story is more resistance-centered, culminating in another fight with Infinite when their paths cross again. He works with Team Chaotix a few times.

Tails' story has him teamed up with E-102 ∆î/Gamma, who he back together; and learn how to be brave without Sonic (i.e.his arc from Adventure 1). His fight with Infinite is an attempt to save Sonic. 

Shadow's story is classic Team Dark shenanigans, Shadow fights Infinite while Omega holds off an army of badniks to provide a distraction so Rouge can sabotage/steal (probably steal) something important.

Bosses  
Tails fights the Egg Dragoon solo.

Silver fights Neo Metal Sonic in a bizarro version of the Sonic vs. Silver fight from '06. Also Neo never got a boss fight.

Shadow is the deciding factor in a clash between the Commander Tower in Diablon and Eggman's big robot of the week. (also we get to see G.U.N. actually do something.)

  
Misc stuff

Infinite does not use phantom copies of Sonic's old foes, he does his own thing, with the cubes. (So we don't have to deal with Zavok)

Tails is going vaguely nuts at first, but gets better over time.

Silver is the victim of the incessant 'It's no use!' line this time around.

Infinite creates a phantom ruby copycat of Blaze named Blizzard to mess with Silver.

Shadow's first stage has him and the rest of Team Dark start from Station Square and end up on Radical Highway of all places.

Silver's 'Crisis City' is the present, in the aftermath of Infinite's return. Silver makes a joke that it looks just like home.

Tails' first stage is outside his head-shaped lab.

Tails stops a missile attack on station square again.

It's implied that Shadow and Commander Tower are pretty good friends now.

Somebody references that Shadow eats coffee beans.

Neo Metal Sonic is *incredibly* sassy when he's not terrifying. (I turned him into MCU Ultron.)

Blaze has a British accent.

Silver implies that the Sol Dimension is functionally Australia.

More minor references to other stuff in the same vein as Frontiers.

Victor Hayes.

The name was a storm in my mind, relentless and consuming. Even as I sat in Ethan‚Äôs office, the weight of it pressed down on me. My fingers clutched the armrest of the chair, holding on like it could anchor me in the moment.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs LaRoche, Ethan,‚Äù I said, my voice cracking under the strain. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him. I know it.‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs sharp gaze didn‚Äôt waver. His silence stretched between us, heavy and suffocating. Finally, he leaned back in his chair, his arms crossed over his chest, his jaw tight. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre right, and Victor is LaRoche, then he‚Äôs already a step ahead of us.‚Äù

The words hit like a punch to my stomach.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs mouth pressed into a thin line, his eyes dark and unreadable. ‚ÄúVictor‚Äôs been circling for years, trying to dismantle my career piece by piece. If he‚Äôs connected to LaRoche, then this isn‚Äôt just professional. It‚Äôs personal. And that makes him dangerous.‚Äù

A chill swept over me. The betrayal in my regression had been personal too. It had cost Sebastian his life.

‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù I asked, my voice small.

‚ÄúWe fight,‚Äù Ethan said, his tone steady, resolute. ‚ÄúWe find proof. Something that ties him to LaRoche‚Äîsomething we can use to stop him before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù

The determination in his voice was enough to steady my trembling hands.

The university archives were colder than I expected, the air dense with the scent of leather and age. The towering shelves stretched endlessly, lined with volumes of history waiting to be uncovered. Ethan moved with purpose, his long strides leading us to a wooden table in the center of the room.

‚ÄúThis is where we start,‚Äù he said, setting down a stack of records. His hands moved with practiced precision, pulling out documents and laying them before me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for anything‚Äîletters, court transcripts, personal accounts‚Äîthat could connect Victor LaRoche to the betrayal you saw.‚Äù

I nodded, though my chest felt tight. My fingers hovered over the first book before finally opening it, the fragile pages whispering softly as they turned.

The hours dragged, marked only by the scratch of Ethan‚Äôs pen and the soft rustle of paper. My eyes burned, the faded ink blurring as exhaustion crept in. But I didn‚Äôt stop. I couldn‚Äôt stop.

And then I found it.

My breath caught as my gaze landed on a letter, the ink faint but still legible. The date‚ÄîMarch 1793‚Äîjumped out at me, the words beneath it slicing through me like a blade.

""The revolutionary known as Devereaux will be at the H√¥tel de Ville on the night of March 15. I trust you will handle this matter with discretion and finality.""

I stared at the signature, my heart pounding. Victor LaRoche.

‚ÄúEthan,‚Äù I whispered, my voice trembling.

He looked up, his expression sharpening as I slid the letter across the table. He read it quickly, his jaw tightening with every word.

‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù he said, his voice low and dangerous. ‚ÄúThis is the betrayal.‚Äù

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. The letter was proof of what I already knew‚Äîthat Victor LaRoche had orchestrated Sebastian‚Äôs death.

But the question that lingered, sharp and insistent, was what his modern counterpart was planning now.

Back in Ethan‚Äôs office, the tension between us was palpable. The letter sat on the desk between us, its weight heavier than the paper it was written on.

‚ÄúVictor Hayes isn‚Äôt just trying to ruin your career,‚Äù I said finally. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs following the same pattern, Ethan. He‚Äôs targeting you the way LaRoche targeted Sebastian.‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs jaw tightened, his hands fisting at his sides. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs true, then he won‚Äôt stop until he gets what he wants.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich is what?‚Äù I asked, the fear in my chest twisting tighter.

‚ÄúTo win,‚Äù Ethan said simply. ‚ÄúNo matter the cost.‚Äù

The air between us felt heavy, electric. His gaze met mine, and for a moment, the weight of everything we‚Äôd uncovered hung unspoken between us.

‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúWe confront him,‚Äù Ethan said, his voice hard with determination. ‚ÄúBut not until we‚Äôre ready. He‚Äôs not going to play fair, Livia.‚Äù

The intensity in his eyes sent a shiver through me. ‚ÄúThen we make sure we don‚Äôt either.‚Äù

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The letter replayed in my mind, its cold, calculated words mocking me. And beneath that, like a low, steady hum, was the memory of LaRoche‚Äôs face in my regression‚Äîthe cruel smirk, the cold eyes that had watched Sebastian fall.

My phone buzzed on the coffee table, pulling me from my thoughts. I snatched it up, my chest tightening when I saw Ethan‚Äôs name.

‚ÄúI found something else,‚Äù he said the moment I answered.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúVictor was on the committee that approved the museum exhibit,‚Äù Ethan said. ‚ÄúHe had access to all the artifacts before they went on display‚Äîincluding Isabelle‚Äôs locket.‚Äù

My breath caught. The locket.

‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs touched it‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, my mind spinning. If Victor Hayes had held the locket, then the connection between him and LaRoche wasn‚Äôt just theoretical. It was tangible. Real.

‚ÄúThis is bigger than us, Livia,‚Äù Ethan said, his voice tight. ‚ÄúIf he knows who we are‚Äîif he remembers‚Äîit‚Äôs only a matter of time before he moves.‚Äù

I closed my eyes, the weight of his words pressing down on me. ‚ÄúThen we need to move first.‚Äù

1ib0vto,https://www.reddit.com/r/behindthebastards/comments/1ib0vto/political_engagement_attempt_1/,Political Engagement Attempt #1,"Hello there. A lot of people feel really hopeless about politics, and the response is usually something along the lines of ""Screw hopelessness, get involved!"" This is something I've struggled to incorporate into my life beyond voting in federal and provincial elections, but I've really wanted to start taking it seriously after the last US election. You could argue ""That's stupid, if you really cared, you would have started sooner than that."" Yes, the best time for me to start would have been ten years ago, but the second best time is now. This week, I took a tiny, insignificant step towards doing that.

For context, I am Canadian, which puts me at a SLIGHT distance from SOME of the awfulness going on in the states, but I'm also aware that there's a good chance the next prime minister will be Pierre Poilievre, who is a terrible person whose ideas aren't far off from Trump's. I live in a riding that is one of fairly few NDP strongholds in the country, which is good. (For context, the NDP is the Canadian party that's somewhat to the left of the Liberal party. They've never run the government, but they consistently have some seats in parliament and are able to influence legislation.) I also suspect the place I live is one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly regions in the world. (I would describe myself as nonbinary, and many of my friends fall under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, but I've waffled over whether I want to go through with any kind of medical transition.) But I don't want to take any of that for granted, and there are still problems that need to be solved.

I have enough trouble taking care of myself most of the time that the idea of taking on big political problems is daunting to me, and although I occasionally went to a meeting and I participated in picketing when I was a grad student and my TA union was on strike, political involvement is something that I've never really incorporated into my life to my satisfaction. I keep comparing myself against the kinds of activism I hear Robert and the other CZM people talking about doing, or even just the kinds of things other users on this subreddit are doing, and feeling like a cowardly and lazy piece of shit by comparison. I feel like my very presence would suck the energy out of any movement I was a part of, and I can't even talk about this with anyone, because there are already so many people expressing their despair that for someone as privileged as me to even DISCUSS my feelings of shame and hesitation would be a burden on other people. I just really don't like myself, and my unhealthy default strategy is to suffer in silence and keep to myself so that I don't get in the way of other, better, more courageous people doing good things.

However, this week, an opportunity finally hit me in the face: I received an e-mail from my local MP, saying that he was holding a ""town hall"" to talk about affordability. Usually when I receive one of these e-mails, it's to a fundraising dinner where you pay a high price to get in, but this was free and within walking distance of my home. I figured, I care about affordability. I was picturing the kind of event where people voice their concerns and the MP responds, and even if I didn't say anything, at least I'd get a sense of what other people in the community were participating. I was a bit nervous and wasn't sure if I would belong there, but I figured, if he didn't want me there, he shouldn't have sent me an invitation. So, I went.

The event was at a local community centre, in a smaller room than I expected, with chairs set up in a circle, and coffee and cupcakes being served. The MP went around and shook everyone's hand, asked us if we needed coffee, etc. Then, he gave a speech which was probably about half an hour long, about affordability and housing and grocery prices and stuff, and about how the NDP was fighting for real people unlike the Liberals and Conservatives who only cared about helping billionaires and the banks. There were a few people in the audience who I'm pretty sure were plants, saying ""Shame!"" when he mentioned the billionaires, and starting applause breaks at appropriate times. It ended with a call to action to put his campaign signs on our lawns and in our windows.

At the end of his speech, the MP said he'd be able to take some questions, but his campaign manager gave the signal that, no, there was no time for that. So that was basically the end of the event and everyone dispersed. Some people stayed behind and talked with him one-on-one. If I had had the energy to do that, and to come up with something interesting to ask him, I would have, but I left after the main event was over.

I found myself a bit frustrated with this experience. Not that I'm against what the MP stands for (it was pretty generically good left-populist stuff) but I definitely felt like I was being advertised to, which didn't match my expectation based on the ""town hall"" that was promised in the e-mail, and also felt unnecessary -- I mean, I was already going to vote for him, and he'd probably win even if I didn't. I was hoping to see an opportunity for more substantive involvement. It made me think of the annoying texts and e-mails from Democrats in the US, e.g. ""Trump is bad! Send us money!"" I mean, yes, Trump is bad, but surely there exist forms of political involvement besides canvassing and giving money to campaigns?

So, what's next for me? I think this event was useful for clarifying for me what I'm looking for in political involvement. One piece of advice I hear often is to pick one or two local issues you consider important and focus on those, and I'm seeing that I should think in terms of issues rather than candidates. So maybe the next step is for me to narrow my scope to a few issues and look into local organizations working on those issues.

I'm wondering - people always say you should write to politicians. I once wrote a letter to the prime minister when I was in high school, and we would sometimes get at least a form-letter response. It might not hurt for me to summarize some of my thoughts about the event and send them to my MP. Just sort of politely mention that I'm on board with his message, but I was hoping to find more substantive ways of helping my community.",3,1737955939.0,behindthebastards,0,0.71,False

Yes, there‚Äôs undeniable beauty in imagining the warmth of their skin beneath your fingertips, the faint trace of their scent lingering like a secret on your clothes, the solace of their chest rising in tune with the rhythm of their heartbeat. These moments are lovely, yes, but perhaps they are just the surface, a tender overture to something much deeper, much quieter. Perhaps the truest form of love is found not in grand gestures or fevered fantasies but in the unassuming cadence of the everyday. There‚Äôs a certain kind of magic in the way their mornings unfold, a slow unraveling of the person they are before the world calls on them. It‚Äôs in the soft stirrings as they wake, the groggy way they rub the sleep from their eyes, or how they stretch lazily against the gentle invasion of morning light streaming through the window. It‚Äôs in the mundane rituals that you learn the rhythm of them, the way they pour their coffee, precise but unhurried, stirring in just the right amount of sugar or none at all. Or how they fold their laundry with a practiced grace, each movement casual yet deliberate, as if the act itself holds meaning. There‚Äôs a quiet kind of joy in observing the smaller things, the seemingly insignificant. The way they lean against the counter while reading the back of a cereal box as if it were poetry, or the way their hair falls messily over their face when they‚Äôre focused on a task. The hum they let slip, almost absentmindedly, as they wash the dishes, or the way they frown ever so slightly when concentrating, unaware of how endearing they look. It‚Äôs in how they tie their shoes, mechanical, practiced, and unthinking, a small ritual repeated a thousand times, yet still distinctly theirs. Even their stillness holds a certain kind of beauty. The way they sit by the window with a book in hand, sunlight brushing their skin like a soft caress, utterly lost in the world between the pages. The way they lean their head back and close their eyes for a moment‚Äôs rest, a fleeting reprieve from the noise of the day. These are the spaces in which they feel most real, the spaces where love finds it‚Äôs truest form, not in fireworks or dramatic confessions but in the calm, steady presence of another person simply being. And perhaps that‚Äôs the real magic. Love is not just in what they do or how they make you feel but in the quiet assurance that they exist, that they occupy this space in the universe alongside you. It‚Äôs in the ordinary moments when the world feels softer, time slower, and their existence more profound. It‚Äôs in the way their presence fills the spaces in between, not with grand declarations but with the simple act of being themselves. And maybe, just maybe, that‚Äôs where love breathes its deepest, in the understated beauty of the everyday.",1,1737955377.0,Coconaad,0,1.0,False

Was told to go to a doctor/pharmacy for 2 separate tests on two separate days (1 morning/afternoon and 1 evening). Immediately cut out smoking and coffee/caffiene from my diet. Today I went for my afternoon test and BP was 112/70, I expect tommorow to be just as good. That being said I also failed my hearing test twice (right ear) but was told by the audiologist and Army liason that I'm not deaf and can still enlist but with specific MOS restrictions (understandable) However this comes as a bit of a shock as I've never had any issues hearing and passed them in school etc. 2 questions going forward. Could my high blood preassure have been negating my focus on the hearing test and or could that be a decent reason for an appeal in that regard? (Retest?)

1ib0pwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1ib0pwj/feeling_better_than_2_years_ago/,Feeling better than 2 years ago ‚Ä¶,"My battle started almost 2 years ago. I don‚Äôt 100% know if I have SIBO, but I‚Äôve suspected it. There was about a 8 months-a year where I truly didn‚Äôt know if my life was going to get better. My life came to a halt. I couldn‚Äôt eat, I wasn‚Äôt working, no traveling, no working out, just doing my best to survive every day. I always told myself that if I ever got to a point where I felt like I was mostly normal again, I would post and give hope to others. I‚Äôm so happy to say that since May of 2024, things have looked up drastically. I am eating and drinking what I love, not missing events, slowly getting back into working out (I had to have an iron infusion in May of 2024 so I‚Äôve taken it very slow), and I am seeing significantly more good days than bad days. Here‚Äôs some background of my personal experience:

May of 2023: Took iron supplements for 2 weeks. My iron is very low because I have endometriosis & bleed a lot. Those supplements made me constipated for the entirety of those 2 weeks. This is what I‚Äôm suspecting gave me SIBO. 

The symptoms came all at once. Here were the most debilitating for me: acid reflux (in many many forms, examples: burning feeling in throat, feeling like I needed to throw up any time I ate, chest pain, stomach burning), nausea, weakness, anxiety, bloating, lightheadedness, and just the inability to eat or drink an ounce of anything without feeling it was going to come right back up. 

This period was hands down the hardest period of my life so far (btw I am a 26F). It was filled with every doctor appt you could think of (endoscopy, extensive stool test, HIDA scan for gallbladder function, multiple blood tests, CT scans, X-rays, I know I‚Äôm forgetting a lot). It was such a blur. Everything came back normal of course except for my iron levels. The only thing my endoscopy showed is inflammation of my throat and some acid. Was prescribed omeprazole per my doctor, NEVER took it and to this day I am so grateful for that decision, and it‚Äôs because of reddit that I didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs amazing what you can learn from reddit that your doctors don‚Äôt even know. 

After much research on Reddit throughout those months, I was starting to connect the dots. All of my symptoms aligned with SIBO-C and/or low stomach acid. I don‚Äôt need any testing to know that I have low stomach acid. You need enough stomach acid to digest food, and my food would never digest fully. A lot of people think since they have acid reflux, they must have too much acid. Reddit taught me that 90% of the time, it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt have enough stomach acid. Well, omeprazole is a stomach acid reducer. If I had taken that per my doctor, I would have been so much worse than I already was. Not only that, but I also learned that omeprazole is NOT to be taken long term, and that you have to wean yourself off of it or you‚Äôll get rebound-reflux (basically acid reflux but 10x worse). Neither of these things were told to me by my doctor. He wanted me on it regularly. 

At this point, I knew I didn‚Äôt have enough stomach acid at least. So how do I fix that part? My wonderful & supportive boyfriend did some research along with me during this time. There were 2 things we consistently came across: Digestive Enzymes/Bitters and Apple Cider Vinegar. We read some conflicting things regarding how hard the enzymes/bitters can be. We also read that Apple cider vinegar is super acidic and inflammatory, at least the liquid form is. But we read wonderful things about Apple cider vinegar capsules. 

I was too scared to buy them and try it, because what if I was wrong? My boyfriend bought them anyways and tried it before I did to show me that I would be safe (I know our bodies our different and it didn‚Äôt necessary mean I wouldn‚Äôt react to it, but it did bring me comfort and enough to make me try it).

It took about 3 days to feel a difference, but since then, my life has been changed completely. My food wasn‚Äôt coming back up, my stomach wasn‚Äôt burning as much, I was actually getting an appetite back, it was truly a miracle. With that, I have also started taking DGL. DGL helps coat your stomach. I take DGL 20 minutes before eating, and my ACV capsule right before my first bite of food. I do this 3x a day. 

I know that I am not cured and still have a long way to go, but I would say that I am 85% back to normal. I have my flare ups of course, but so does everyone. I‚Äôm working full time again, I‚Äôm working out, eating my favorite foods without limitation, drinking my sweet coffee again, and I never thought I would be one to post a good update on this thread. I always told myself I would post because all you ever see is the panic and uncertainty (understandably). I used to be one who would panic-post all of the time. It took over my life and I never thought I‚Äôd feel close to normal again. I still have to try to nail the SIBO aspect, but for right now, I am functioning just fine and to me that‚Äôs all that matters. I hope this post brings someone some peace and comfort. I am always open to answer any questions at any time. ‚ù§Ô∏è  ",2,1737955327.0,SIBO,1,1.0,False

1ib0k5n,https://i.redd.it/66y8zlaqzgfe1.jpeg,How does a motion logo impact website user experience?,"How Motion Logos Make Your Website the VIP Lounge of User Experiences


Alright, let‚Äôs set the stage. Imagine walking into a restaurant. You‚Äôre greeted by a boring ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù sign versus a sleek neon animation that flashes your name with a little wink. Which one makes you think, ‚ÄúOh, this place gets me‚Äù? That‚Äôs what a motion logo does for your website. It‚Äôs not just a logo‚Äîit‚Äôs a vibe, a handshake, and a fireworks show rolled into one. Let‚Äôs dive into how this little animation can turn your website into a five-star experience.


---

1. First Impressions: The Netflix vs. Blockbuster Effect
Here‚Äôs the deal: visitors decide whether they like your website in milliseconds. That‚Äôs less time than it takes to sneeze! A static logo says, ‚ÄúHey, we exist.‚Äù A motion logo says, ‚ÄúHey, we exist, and we‚Äôre amazing.‚Äù Think of it like Netflix‚Äôs snazzy ta-dum versus Blockbuster‚Äôs...silence. Which one do you think people remember? Exactly.


---

2. Engagement Level: Static Is Snoozy, Motion Is Magnetic
A motion logo is like the host of a great party‚Äîit makes your visitors feel welcome and entertained. When your logo swooshes, spins, or transforms, it‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄúStay a while, we‚Äôve got more where this came from.‚Äù It‚Äôs the digital equivalent of serving appetizers that are too good to walk away from.


---

3. Emotional Connection: Animation = Instant Personality
Static logos are like that coworker who speaks only in emails‚Äîuseful but forgettable. A motion logo is that coworker who walks into the office with coffee for everyone and a hilarious story to tell. Animation gives your brand personality, whether it‚Äôs playful, sleek, or bold. It makes your visitors think, ‚ÄúHey, I like this brand. We could be friends.‚Äù


---

4. Guiding the User Journey: Follow the Motion
Ever notice how your eyes naturally follow movement? A motion logo isn‚Äôt just cool to look at; it‚Äôs a built-in GPS for your site. It subtly guides users to the next step, whether it‚Äôs scrolling down, clicking a button, or exploring your products. It‚Äôs like a friendly little nudge that says, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs keep going!‚Äù


---

5. Memorability: Leaving a Digital Signature
Static logos are easy to forget. But a motion logo? It‚Äôs a memory in the making. Imagine your logo swooping onto the screen like a superhero, leaving your visitors thinking, ‚ÄúWhoa, that was cool.‚Äù Every time they see your brand elsewhere, they‚Äôll remember that moment. Congratulations, you‚Äôve just rented space in their brain.


---

6. SEO? Say Hello to Lower Bounce Rates
Motion logos don‚Äôt just look pretty‚Äîthey work. A well-designed animation keeps visitors on your site longer, which tells search engines, ‚ÄúHey, people actually like this place.‚Äù And guess what? Google rewards that. It‚Äôs like your motion logo is high-fiving your SEO strategy.


---

Closing: The Mic Drop Moment
So, what‚Äôs the verdict? A motion logo isn‚Äôt just an accessory; it‚Äôs the MVP of your website‚Äôs user experience. It grabs attention, builds connection, and keeps people coming back for more.

In a world full of boring websites, a motion logo makes yours the VIP lounge where everyone wants to hang out. Ready to roll out the red carpet for your users? Start with a logo that moves‚Äîand watch the magic happen.

Iv had insomnia since I was born and I'm also very connected to nature and night time. Lately iv been sleeping around midday, \~10am at the earliest, for little more than 3 hours. Iv been able to be fully awake and alert for every other hour im awake, and more, iv felt better from it.

[USA],"Postcard Cabins (formally Getaway Cabins - they changed their name a few months ago) is a chain that offers tiny houses/cabins outside of major cities in the US. They have 30ish locations and just got acquired by Marriott so they seem to be pretty established and doing well. I just booked the Los Angeles/Big Bear location for a long weekend in April but decided to look on Airbnb to see what my other options in the area are. To my surprise, Postcard also on there! But, weirdly, it seems like a better deal to book on Airbnb. 

For one, they are offering a $90 discount for booking more than 30 days in advance (which is a better deal than the current 25% off sale they are offering - there is always some kind of 15-30% off deal offered on their website). Also, booking direct with the standard, nonrefundable rate I have 14 days before the stay to cancel or reschedule. But with Airbnb, it says I have up to 7 days before the reservation to cancel, and I like the flexibility. Also on the Postcard website there are add-ons you can prepurchase for your stay, like firewood starter kits/bundles and s'mores kits which are an extra fees, but apparently with Airbnb they throw in firewood, the s'mores kit, and some extras like coffee, tea, and hot chocolate packs and bottled water.

What's interesting is that booking direct on their website you have the option of a one or two bed cabin. It seems on Airbnb it's only for the 1 bed cabin. Also direct on the website you can pay extra to have a guaranteed mountain view vs a forest view. On Airbnb they don't have any view options.

I guess I'm wondering what the catch is with this? Are they trying to fill in whatever extra cabins they have for those nights like what hotels do on third party hotel sites (hence why there is no information about the views)? It seems weird that they are also on Airbnb when they have their own booking website and it seems odd that booking with Airbnb would save me money, especially because I'm sure it costs them money when a guest doesn't book direct with them. Besides the view guarantee (and I really want the mountain view) it almost seems too good to be true. Is there something I'm missing?

ACT ONE

Scene 1: Suburban Chaos
The camera pans over a quiet suburban street, focusing on James Carter (mid-30s, a disheveled yet charming everyman) sipping coffee on his porch. He‚Äôs wearing a flannel shirt, glancing at the chaotic world around him‚Äîhis quirky neighbors argue, a stray dog wreaks havoc, and a kid on a skateboard crashes into a mailbox.

James mutters:
James:
‚ÄúAnother day in paradise‚Ä¶‚Äù

Cut to his phone buzzing with a work email about layoffs. His face falls.


---

Scene 2: Enter the Theater
Walking aimlessly through town, James stumbles across the old community theater, The Golden Screen, now a shell of its former glory. A marquee sign reads:
""Not Closing, Just Beginning!""

Inside, James meets Gloria (a feisty theater owner in her 60s) desperately trying to keep the place afloat. She mistakes James for a volunteer, and before he can correct her, he‚Äôs swept into her grand plan to revive the theater.


---

ACT TWO

Scene 3: The Reluctant Star
Gloria convinces James to be the ‚Äúface‚Äù of her revival campaign. She plaster his picture on posters and insists he perform in a quirky community play. James resists at first but eventually gives in after Gloria guilt-trips him with free coffee and cookies.

Meanwhile, James bonds with the eccentric theater crew, including:

Maggie, a single mom rediscovering her passion for acting.

Lou, an overdramatic director who takes everything way too seriously.

Benji, a teenage tech wiz trying to modernize the theater.



---

Scene 4: Comedy Meets Drama
James finds himself juggling his dead-end job, a blossoming romance with Maggie, and the overwhelming chaos of keeping the theater alive. Amid the laughs and mishaps, James begins to rediscover his own spark, realizing the theater isn‚Äôt just saving itself‚Äîit‚Äôs saving him too.


---

ACT THREE

Scene 5: Opening Night Disaster
On the eve of the theater‚Äôs grand reopening, disaster strikes:

The lead actor quits, leaving James to step in.

A power outage threatens to cancel the show.

James‚Äôs boss arrives, demanding he leave to attend an emergency meeting.


Against all odds, James steps up, delivers a heartfelt and hilariously awkward performance, and the audience falls in love with the play.


---

Why it matters: It's a dramatic turnaround given Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced retaliatory tariffs hours after Trump said earlier Sunday he'd impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Colombia, which is a leading supplier of coffee and flowers in the U.S.

    Trump's threat to impose tariffs and other sanctions on Colombia after the Latin American country refused to accept two deportation flights from the U.S. briefly ignited fears of a further surge in already high coffee prices, Axios' Ben Berkowitz notes.

The intrigue: Petro initially reposted the White House statement announcing Trump's decision that Leavitt posted to X, but appears to have since rescinded this action.

    Colombian officials did not immediately comment on Leveatt's statement.

What they're saying: ""The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay,"" Leavitt said in a statement.

    ""Based on this agreement, the fully drafted IEEPA tariffs and sanctions will be held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement,"" she said. 

Yes, but: Leavitt said the State Department-issued visa sanctions and ""enhanced inspections from Customs and Border Protection"" will ""remain in effect until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned.""

Context: Trump said on Truth Social early Sunday he would target Colombia with other sanctions in additions to the tariffs imposed over the refusal to accept flights ‚Äî including a travel ban on government officials and financial penalties.

State of play: Colombia has remained a key U.S. ally under the tenure of leftist leader Petro, per Axios' Astrid Galv√°n and Avery Lotz.

    ""Colombia is also the United States' third-largest trade partner in Latin America and U.S.-owned affiliates account for more than 90,000 jobs in Colombia,"" according to the State Department.

============

Do you feel stuck? Maybe you try many diets, but the weight does not come off. It is a frustrating problem many people face. Many look for easy solutions for **weight loss**. *MCTs*, or **medium-chain triglycerides**, are becoming very popular in the diet world. These special fats might help. Some foods naturally have **MCTs**. This article will explore these *MCT foods*. We will see how they can help you in your **weight loss** journey.

What are MCTs and Why are they Relevant for Weight Loss?
--------------------------------------------------------

Let me tell you about **MCTs**. These are special fats called **medium-chain triglycerides**. They are not like the usual fats, which are **long-chain triglycerides** or *LCTs*. **MCTs** are shorter. This makes them easier for the body to use. Usually, body stores fats for later use. **MCTs** go straight to the liver. Liver turns **MCTs** into quick energy. Body burns them like fuel. This is why they are good for **weight loss**. They are less likely to be stored as body fat. *MCTs* may increase how many calories your body burns. Thus, *MCTs* help support **weight loss** differently from *LCTs*.

The Science-Backed Benefits of MCTs for Weight Loss
---------------------------------------------------

I learned that **MCTs** can do many things for **weight loss**. One interesting thing is how they affect your hunger. **MCTs** can make you feel full for longer time. I hear this is because they change some hormones in your body. When you are not so hungry, you eat less food. This helps with **weight loss**. *MCTs* can also boost your *metabolism*. This means your body burns calories faster. Also, **MCTs** are used quickly for energy. They can promote something called *fat oxidation*. That means your body burns fat to get energy. Many studies show these effects of **MCTs**. This makes them useful for people trying to lose weight.

### MCTs and Appetite Control

*MCTs* help control my hunger. They can make you feel full. One way is by changing *hormones*. These *hormones* are related to satiety, the feeling of fullness. When I eat **MCTs**, my body releases more of these fullness *hormones*. This is one mechanism. These **MCTs** help reduce how much food one eats. It also helps control calorie intake. Thus, one is less likely to overeat. My diet plan uses the idea that when you are not so hungry, it's easy to make better food choices. This means that the *MCTs* are not just about burning fat. It's also about eating less food. This is a very important key for *weight loss*.

### MCTs for Increased Energy and Fat Oxidation

My body uses **MCTs** for energy fast. It is a big difference compared to usual fats. When body gets *MCTs*, it doesn't store it as fat. It turns them to energy very fast. This quick energy boost can help my workouts. When I do some activity, I can burn more calories and even more fat. This is called *fat oxidation*. **MCTs** can help my body burn fat as fuel during exercise. Also, this helps with more weight loss. I take *MCTs* for extra power in the gym. This helps me to train better and reach my **weight loss** goals. This shows the power of **MCTs** for my weight loss.

Top MCT-Rich Foods to Incorporate into Your Diet
------------------------------------------------

I explored what foods have **MCTs**. **Coconut oil** is popular but not the best. It is about half **MCTs**. The other half is other fats. **MCT oil** is a more concentrated form. It is often used in diets. **MCT powder** is another option. It mixes well into drinks and food. *MCTs* can also be found in some dairy products in smaller amounts. But *coconut oil*, **MCT oil** and **MCT powder** are best. I often use these in my daily food. Choosing the right kind helps me get a high dose of **MCTs**. Thus, *MCTs* support my goals of **weight loss**.

### Coconut Oil - A Common Source of MCTs

**Coconut oil** is a well-known source of *MCTs*. I often see people use it. However, it is not the perfect source. About half of **coconut oil** is *MCTs*. The other half is *LCTs*. Those are the fats which are not easy to burn. These do not help much with weight loss. This is why it is not the best for me to take **coconut oil** for high doses of *MCTs*. Although it has some *MCTs*, it does not contain high amounts of them. That's why pure **MCT oil** is a better option. **Coconut oil** is still a part of some diets. It has other good qualities. But to focus on **MCTs**, I prefer using other forms.

### MCT Oil vs MCT Powder

**MCT oil** and **MCT powder** both are good forms of **MCTs**, but they are different. *MCT oil* is liquid. It is made from concentrated *MCTs*. Some think it is more efficient for **weight loss** because of high concentration of **MCTs**. You can mix it into drinks or use it in food. However, some people say that it can be hard on stomach, especially if used in high doses. **MCT powder** is a dried version. It can be easier on stomach and good for blending in. It also can be less oily, which is important for some people. *MCT powder* is easier to use when traveling. I think, the best form for **MCTs** depends on personal preference and how the body reacts.

How to Use MCT Foods for Optimal Weight Loss Results
----------------------------------------------------

I learned how to use **MCT foods** for good **weight loss**. I add **MCT oil** to my coffee in the morning. It gives me energy. I use **MCT powder** in my smoothies after a gym workout. I use it to mix into salad dressing for lunch. It is important to have a balanced diet. I also need to do some exercise for better results. **MCTs** work best when you eat healthy and active. Starting slow is also very important. I do not take too much too fast, as I might get stomach problems. I slowly increase the dose over time to get to higher tolerance. It is good to combine **MCTs** with healthy food choices and exercise for my **weight loss** plan.

Potential Side Effects and Considerations When Using MCTs
---------------------------------------------------------

I know that there can be some side effects with *MCTs*. Some people get stomach problems, like bloating or nausea. This can happen if I take too much **MCTs** quickly. So, I started with small amounts. I slowly increased it. This helped my body get used to it. It's important to also drink enough water with **MCTs**. People who have any health problems should speak to a doctor before taking *MCTs*. A doctor can help if it is safe for their health condition. For most, **MCTs** are safe when you are careful and start slowly. But, you should be aware of the possible risks.

### Who Should be Careful When Using MCTs

Not everyone should use **MCTs** without care. If someone has liver problems, **MCTs** may not be good for them. Also, people with problems in digestion should be careful. I read that for those with diabetes, they should use **MCTs** only with doctor's advice. This is because **MCTs** can affect sugar level. If you are pregnant or breast feeding, it is good to discuss with the doctor before you use **MCTs**. It is important to be careful and consult a healthcare professional if you have any existing health conditions. **MCTs** are good, but they are not right for everyone.

MCTs for Weight Loss: Tips and Tricks for Success
-------------------------------------------------

Here are some ideas I use for **MCTs** and **weight loss**. I take **MCT oil** in my coffee before morning workout. This helps me get energy. I use **MCT powder** in my smoothies, with good protein. This helps me feel full after a gym. I also learned that it is good to eat **MCTs** with other healthy food, not alone. This helps body use **MCTs** better. Consistency is very important. *MCTs* may take some time to show results. When you do it regularly, then it has better effect. Small, regular doses are better than big doses once in a while. These steps helped me. This might help you in your journey.

Conclusion
----------

*MCT* **foods** can be good for **weight loss** when you use them right. *MCTs* can help you feel full, give you energy, and help your body burn fat. **MCT oil** and **MCT powder** are good ways to take **MCTs**. But be careful. Do not take too much at the start. Always start small, increase as you go. Make sure to have a balanced diet and exercise. And most important, be consistent. Speak to your doctor before starting **MCTs**, especially if you have a health problem. If done well, **MCT foods** can make a difference. So, start to use *MCT-rich foods* gradually and see the difference for yourself.

I met this guy at a Christmas party and he was ve egg sweet and funny. I knew his age at the time but he didn‚Äôt know mine. ( FYI, I have never had anyone guess my age correctly. I‚Äôve been mistaken as 20 all the way to 25 {most of the time I get 22}) 

We were flirting and he was adorable and witty. He is taller than me (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and he‚Äôs like 6‚Äô2‚Äù~6‚Äô3‚Äù-ish). He had some stupid tattoos and made me laugh. 

Only person I knew at the party was my dad and I was the youngest one there everyone else was in their 40s or 50s so me and him and his friend were like the only ones similar in age. I was very awkward and anxious, and he definitely calmed me down. 

He did not find out about my age until the end of the night and then we talked and planned on meeting up in 2 weeks (he was gonna teach me how to play the guitar) 

Fast-forward two weeks with the whole guitar lesson thing was really embarrassing for me because my I was trying to tune my guitar for about 15 minutes and then we found out that it was broken and it would not stay in tune and so I just left his house and I immediately blocked him because I was so embarrassed. Nothing to do with him it was all me. (I‚Äôm a ball of anxiety)

(doesn‚Äôt matter that I blocked him because he never texted me anyway) 

Fast-forward 2 more weeks and my dad calls me down from upstairs and told me that‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs call her Maya  (the lady who threw the Christmas party. Her son and‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs call him guitar boy, were best friends since childhood so he grew up with her and they know each other) 

Maya told my dad that he liked me but he was very wary because he didn‚Äôt like the age gap. He told her that he would be ok with something like 20 and 24 but 22 and 18 is a bit scary. Which I can understand.

*I unblock him* 

Give it some time fast-forward like 2 weeks again and yesterday I woke up to a text from him (first time in a month) at 8 AM, asking me how I was doing and I responded and we were having a good conversation and then he asked me out for coffee. We had a coffee date today and it was awesome.

I was anxious at first, but he quickly calmed my nerves. He got himself a coffee and he got me some tea (I don‚Äôt like coffee) and then we sat down and then we talked and talked, and in a blink of an eye, two hours past and we did not realize it and he had to go somewhere and I also had stuff to do so we parted ways.

He‚Äôs very sweet, very respectful and very funny. When we were leaving, I asked him for a hug and he gave me one. This was honestly one of the best‚ÄîIf not THE best first dates I‚Äôve ever had, but I‚Äôm definitely gonna take this slow. we are not dating. It‚Äôs not set in stone.

1ib03og,https://www.reddit.com/r/HoLEP/comments/1ib03og/holep_procedure_january_22_2025_a_positive/,"HoLEP Procedure January 22, 2025 - a positive experience!","**TLDR**

I had the procedure on Tuesday Jan. 22, 2025, and it went as well as could be expected, no real pain or discomfort, recovery has been very easy so far. 

As a reference, I broke a big toenail on Day 2 at home and that hurt way worse than anything associated with this procedure!

**Background**: 

Note: the posts on here helped me immensely in understanding and dealing with fear of the unknown regarding the procedure and outcomes. I will therefore try to describe in some detail my experience in the hopes it helps someone else.

I am 73 yo, and I have had BPH for approximately 10 years. It progressed to where I was taking 2 Flomax per day, and 1 Finasteride (Proscar) daily. 

**Making the Decision:**

In fall of 2023 I had a urinary retention issue, requiring successive catheters, following a colonoscopy (caused by anesthesia). 

In spring of 2024 I had a bladder stone, followed by kidney stones, and a kidney infection, due to bladder urine retention.   
My urologist told me I was most likely going to need a procedure of some type. He did an ultrasound followed by a scan and arrived at a prostate size of 185 gms. About 3+ times ""normal"".

I began searching for procedures appropriate for that large a prostate and I discovered HoLEP. There was no one doing the procedure in the area in South Carolina where we were living. Initially I was planning to travel to Vanderbilt, to see Dr. Nicole Miller,

In July of this year, we relocated to the Raleigh area (for other non-related reasons), and it turns out there was an experienced HoLEP surgeon at Duke. His name was Dr. Chad Gridley. As it turned out, he had trained at Vanderbilt with Dr. Miller, I saw him in September, and we decided that the procedure was right for me. I was definitely in need of some procedure, and doing it sooner was better than later since I am currently in good health, and who knows what the future brings...

The procedure was scheduled for January 22, 2025. I could have gone in early December , but I was looking to avoid the holidays, not knowing what recovery would be like.

**Pre-OP** 

I had an appointment a week before the procedure, they took health info, blood and urine samples, and gave me instructions about eating, medicines, liquids, etc. They reminded me to update my healthcare directives since I had moved from another state.

**Procedure Day**

We arrived at 5AM for a 7AM procedure at Duke Raleigh Hospital, processed the insurance, paid the copay. and went to Pre-OP.  

I met with Doctor Gridley, the anesthesiologist, and his nurse practitioner, they brought me to operating room at 730 and I woke up at 1230 in recovery.

Originally scheduled for 3 hours, it took almost 4 hours because of the size. 

I was moved to a Stepdown Unit room in the hospital. I was a little drowsy from the anesthesia, but otherwise, felt no pain or discomfort.

Was able to eat and drink. I did have a Foley Catheter. 

I rested comfortably, no pain or discomfort of note, some tingling from the catheter, but nothing worse than I had experienced before.

Didn't sleep much, even though I had my CPAP. Too much coffee?

**Discharge Day**

The hospital Urology team came to discharge me early, removed the catheter and did a bladder voiding test, which I passed. No urine in the bladder. I was going home catheter free!!

They prescribed Tylenol 3x per day, AZO Pyridine and stool softeners/laxatives.

Told me to walk, as much as I felt good doing, but NOT to STRAIN. 

Went home wearing a Depends cup shaped guard inside my underwear. (no diaper)

We, stopped at a grocery on the way home and bought salads for lunch, I walked the store, and had no pain or discomfort.

Ate lunch, took a nap, took my meds and watched TV. 

Urinated 3 times that day, full stream, great flow. some burning at the beginning, urine was pink, with red towards the end. Pads were spotted but not soaked. 

Only leaking was right before and right after urinating.

**Day 2** 

The AZO makes your urine orange. Its supposed to relive the burning. Which I believe it did quite well, 80%. 

I was constipated coming home from the hospital, but the laxatives fixed that by day 2. 

No discomfort sitting. As I lay in bed, I could sense some mild sensations in my pelvic floor, not real pain or discomfort, just light pressure.

**Day 3 and 4** 

More of the same, stream is clear now, took AZO for 3 days, then stopped as directed. Urine is yellow, and clear, no blood. Went to church, also went to a Podiatrist, as I managed to break my big toenail on Day 2. 

Using 2-3 pads per day, they are only spotted, not saturated at all. No problems through the night, woke up once, no leakage.

Honestly the toe pain was worse by a factor of 5 than any pain from the procedure!

**Summary**

This is probably anti-climactic, but the procedure couldn't have gone better. I had no pain to speak of, minimum blood in the urine, incontinence is minimum and manageable with just pads, bowel is fine as long as I take the laxatives as prescribed.

Thanks to Dr. Gridley and his team, and all the fine folks I met at Duke Raleigh hospital. 

Prayers work!

**Next Steps:**

No lifting or sexual activity for 4 weeks

walking is ok, car travel is ok.

follow-up in 3 months. 

I will post updates as time goes on, and glad to answer any questions folks may have.

I (M53) met a woman (F50) on a dating app early February 2024. I wasn‚Äôt long out of a longterm relationship. Yes, it was a rebound for me. At the time, upon reflection, my confidence was at an all time low and I was grateful that any woman would want to date me. 

I‚Äôve done a lot of work on myself since and I‚Äôm happy and confident within myself now. 

Anyway, let‚Äôs call this woman Claire. 

After our third date we agreed to give each other a chance to build a relationship. (After we split I realised this was a rookie dating error on my part. I should have continued to go on dates with other women rather than hitching my wagon to Claire this early.)

She‚Äôd been single since her divorce several years prior (her ex divorced her).

We got along immediately, strong chemistry, amazing cerebral and emotionally open chats, and after the 4th date, great sex.

We were both able to express our sexuality together and we talked about this a lot, to get to our respective ages and finally be free to be who we are. 

But our relationship was balanced by really deep introspective talks about life and emotions and healing etc. 

She told me on a few occasions how safe she felt with me. One night on the phone she listed all of the green flags I‚Äôd given her during our first few dates. 

We made as much time for each other as possible but for the first maybe 2 months she could be a little hot and cold via messages. But when we were together she was always kind and caring and gentle, funny and attentive and very into me. She was also very thoughtful.

And I was very into her.

After a long marriage and then a longterm relationship, I felt I‚Äôd finally found my true match. She said she‚Äôd felt she‚Äôd waiting years to meet hers, me. She‚Äôd praise me for my ‚Äúemotional intelligence‚Äù or ‚Äúmasculine confidence‚Äù.

Anyway, as we approached 4 months together she went on holiday with her adult children. We‚Äôd be apart for 2 weeks. That was fine. Towards the end of her holiday I made a joke about doing a video call and maybe getting a ‚Äúflash‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt actually serious and I regret saying it as later that night on the phone she really tore into me for suggesting it. 

She said it made her feel cheap and if that‚Äôs the sort of thing I was into she wasn‚Äôt the woman for me. She‚Äôd been drinking before the call and she sounded very harsh. 

I explained it‚Äôs not my thing, I was just clumsily trying to let her know I found her really desirable. 

She replied that it had dredged up things for her and she was struggling with it. She said for her being in a relationship is about her shifting through some bad shit to find the good. 

This made no sense to me at all at the time or since, but on the call I remained calm and suggested we talk about it, I was willing to go there with her to sort it out. I wanted to work through it. She didn‚Äôt want to open up about what my comment had dredged up. She took a couple of other moments in our time together and seemed to deliberately twist them to make me look like the bad guy. 

I didn‚Äôt bite, I said we should maybe talk about it when she was back. 

She came back from holiday and came over to my place. I honestly didn‚Äôt feel particularly safe. I was worried by how she‚Äôd twisted things and basically accused me of being a creepy guy. I didn‚Äôt and couldn‚Äôt initiate any physical contact. 

We didn‚Äôt talk about what had been said during the phone call a few nights prior, which we should have done. We just sat on the couch and chatted quite generally. And we had next to no physical contact, which wasn‚Äôt like us. 

We had some food and went to bed. She‚Äôd hinted the day before about catch up sex. I feigned tiredness. I woke up an hour or so later and felt really uncomfortable being in bed with her so tried to sleep on the couch. 

The next morning she asked what was going on. I asked her if she remembered the things she‚Äôd said on the phone and whether she stood by them. She said she did and she did. She implied I‚Äôm the sort of guy that needs nude photos of her to get off. She twisted me saying I hoped for a ‚Äúflash‚Äù on a video call to me asking her to send me nudes. 

This shocked and appalled me. 

I‚Äôd never asked or even hinted at getting nudes from her. It‚Äôs not my thing. 

She conceded that I‚Äôm not a creepy guy but that I‚Äôd ‚Äúdisplayed creepy behaviour‚Äù.

By now I‚Äôm wondering if she had unresolved trauma from previous relationships. And I‚Äôm also feeling very unsafe around her. 

All of this flew in the face or her telling me how safe she felt. The green flags. 

She said she was leaving and I left my bedroom to allow her privacy to get dressed. 

Before she left, we ended up hugging and I could see what looked like real sadness and devastation on her face. I suggested that she stay and talk. She said she‚Äôd message me later. 

This was before 9am. She messaged after 9pm to say she was still trying to figure out how to deal with what this had dredged up in her and that she was sorry it didn‚Äôt work out. 

I replied that it was a shame and I wished her well. 

A few days later my gut was still churning so I messaged asking for clarification on being told I‚Äôd behaved like a creep. 

Side note: I‚Äôd told a few female friends - straight and gay - by this point about what had happened. None of them felt what I‚Äôd done was wrong or creepy.

Claire replied the following day that I wasn‚Äôt creepy. She said she‚Äôd felt nothing but safe with me and that she‚Äôd reacted based on her own insecurities (she didn‚Äôt expand on what they are). She apologised. 

I asked what we should do next, she said sadly it wasn‚Äôt going to work between us. She sent me another text expressing how sad she felt for hurting me and her sadness at losing me. 

I said I respected that and said I‚Äôd be open to keep in touch. 

We exchanged a couple of messages over the next couple of weeks. Then I asked if she could drop off some things I‚Äôd let her borrow. She offered to drop them at my work. We met the next day and she looked nervous and uncertain.

I asked her if she was ok, she said she felt bad. 

I calmly told her not to feel bad, no harm had been done (which was true; I was hurt, but I‚Äôve survived much worse).

And that was it. I got my stuff. She left. 

I went on to meet and date several women after her. Most of them one and done dates. 1 went to around 4 weeks of us seeing each other, another was 5 weeks. 

3 of the women have kept in touch with me and we consider each other friends now. Even one that I saw for around 5 weeks. These women have had no issue in staying in touch, even occasionally meeting for a coffee catch up. All platonic. 

Roughly 4 months after we split a friend asked me about a self development course Claire had been doing while we were together and whether it would be good for him. I said I‚Äôd message her and ask. 

In my message I asked how she was and about the course. She replied that all was good with her and answered my question. She didn‚Äôt ask how I was. 

Part of my issue now, almost a year after meeting Claire, is I would really love to connect with her. As I said, I‚Äôve been able to stay in friendly terms with other women I‚Äôve dated. 

A big part of it is to hopefully ‚Äúcure‚Äù me of her. Because even though the way things ended hurt me and she was harsh - in direct contrast to how I‚Äôd always found her to be - I‚Äôve never felt the spark or attraction to any other woman I‚Äôve dated. I‚Äôd be in an intimate situation with a woman and I‚Äôd be comparing it to how it was with Claire, the immediate connection and understanding we had. 

The shared sense of humour. The mutual admiration we seemed to share. 

Since November of last year I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm quite happy being single. So I don‚Äôt necessarily want to rekindle a romantic relationship with Claire. 

And yes, my friends have all warned me off her. She unstable. Unhinged. Evil. That‚Äôs what they tell me. Obviously I don‚Äôt feel that paints an accurate picture of her. Damaged? Yes. But we all are. 

I‚Äôd just like the fabled ‚Äúclosure‚Äù. And yeah, to tell her I wished she could have let me into whatever issues had been dredged up. To thank her for our time together (I definitely learned valuable lessons about dating after 50, openness, intimacy, etc). One day in particular we spent together will always be up there for me in terms of how wonderful it was. 

I ran the idea last a female friend of reaching out to Claire. She said it gives off ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù. She said it would received as ‚Äúthe women have dried up‚Äù. 

It would just be nice to properly shake her off. The longterm relationship I‚Äôd been in before I met Claire I‚Äôve squared that away. Made peace with it ending.  

Yet the 4 months with Claire lingers on.

Sharing my experience with and tried to add some structure for clarity. Pictures of the property are in* [this Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/06AqYJ6)*.*

Also: x-posted to r/chubbytravel - see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1iazryo/stay_at_auberge_hacienda_altagracia_costa_rica/)

We spent four nights over Thanksgiving at **Hacienda Alta Gracia** in Costa Rica, and it was an incredible experience. Here's an honest breakdown:

**Context**

* **Family:** Myself (47), my wife (48), and our two daughters (6 and 3).
* **Background:** Based in the NYC area, accustomed to luxe and ultra-luxe travel, though relatively new to spending $$$$ (our new goal is to spend with intentionality).
* **Travel Style:** With my frequent work travel (50% of the time), I‚Äôve amassed top-tier airline and hotel, status and a huge number of hotel, airline, and credit card points‚ÄîTitanium Lifetime with Marriott, Globalist with Hyatt etc. This has made perks like suite upgrades, free breakfast, and late checkouts hard to pass up. However, as ‚Äúthe game‚Äù gets trickier, we‚Äôve shifted towards burning down our balances ASAP (within reason - we‚Äôre not going to be silly)

**What We Were Looking For**

1. **Luxury:** Something in the luxe or ultra-luxe category.
2. **Family Fun:** Activities for all of us together (gofunod for the family)
3. **Couple Time:** Opportunities for my wife and me to unwind (fun for the couple)
4. **Kid-Friendly:** Activities to keep the kids happy and engaged (fun for the kids)

**How we booked**

* Booked via Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts (FHR).
* Total: $8,302.52 (USD) for 4 nights (\~$2,075.63 per night).
* Room: Started with a standard casita, upgraded one level to a larger casita due to FHR
* Got the Amex FHR $100 credit but boy did we have to fight for it. They kept telling me that it was already included in the rate
* The Amex rate was about $1000 less than the booking directly through the property.

**Price & Inclusions:**

* It‚Äôs a pseudo all-inclusive resort, which is rare for us since we usually dislike all-inclusives (no buffets here, thankfully!).
* Breakfast and lunch menus are static, while the dinner menu changes daily. Alcohol is not included, but soft drinks and minibar items are.

**What's Included:**

* **Roundtrip Air Transfer:** From San Jose (SJO) to the hotel‚Äôs private airstrip on their chartered plane. The service includes a private immigration terminal and seamless transfer.
   * Kids under 3 fly free (on lap). For kids older than 3, it‚Äôs $375 each way + tax ($780 round trip total).
   * On our day the weather was bad and it was windy at the hotel air strip so they landed at the airstrip at a nearby town (San Isidro). They didn't tell us this until we landed there which was disappointing. They then told us it was 20 min drive to the hotel and took nearly an hour. Also disappointing. The GM happened to be on our flight as well coming back from a day trip to San Jose.
* **Food & Drinks:**
   * All meals and soft drinks.
   * Minibar stocked with snacks, soft drinks, tea, coffee, and even beers.
* **Spa Experiences:** Access to The Well for treatments like clay baths, hot tubs, and perhaps the hottest steam room I have ever been in.
* **Activities:** Yoga, Pilates, and daily specials (we did a sound bath activity with a visiting practioner).

**The Property**

* It's beautiful
* Rooms are large and really well taken care of
* Amazing food
* Nestled in the rainforest, it‚Äôs lush, tranquil, and wet. Expect rain daily (sometimes heavy).
* Golf carts are available for easy transport, and we never waited more than five minutes.

# The Rooms

* We stayed in a 1,500 sq. ft. King Casa (upgraded from the 1,200 sq. ft. entry-level casita).
* Highlights:
   * Spacious terrace.
   * Thoughtful touches for the kids: a twin rollaway bed, crib, and even a tent that our 3-year-old loved sleeping in.
* Downsides: Most rooms lack bathtubs‚Äîdisappointing for a property like this.

# The Food

* **Sensational:** Everything from breakfast to dinner was top-notch, with standout dishes using local ingredients (90% sourced nearby).
* The **Mercado coffee shop** is a gem‚Äîdon‚Äôt miss the corn and ginger cookies or the coffee-tasting class.
* Dining venues: The main restaurant, poolside dining (family and adult pools), and occasional outdoor events like ""El Cultivo"" dinners. Sadly they were not doing El Cultivo during our stay.

# Service

* Overall excellent. Staff made an effort to learn every guest‚Äôs name (fewer than 50 rooms, so \~100 guests max).
* The massage I had was one of the best I‚Äôve ever experienced.

**Room for Improvement**

# Kids‚Äô Club

* There‚Äôs no dedicated kids‚Äô club building.
* Activities (like corn-making (Elote?), mocktail classes, horse bathing & grooming, and arts & crafts) happen around the property.
* It‚Äôs **pricey**: $75 per half day (plus 13% tax and 10% service charge = \~$185/day).
* While our 6-year-old had a great time (she was the only child for three days), the setup wasn‚Äôt ideal. Seeing us around the property made her want to leave. A centralized kids‚Äô space might help.
* Babysitting is $35/hou for up to 2 kids
   * Babysitting was mediocre‚Äîdisappointing for the price and the property‚Äôs caliber.
* TBH, if the kids clab was free we probably would have spent more on activities. I feel like that‚Äôs the expectation with a kids club - the parents spend $$$ so this seems a bit ‚Äúpenny wise, pound foolish‚Äù on the part of their management.

# Air Transfer Fees

* Since we only used the air transfer one way, we hoped for flexibility with our 6-year-old‚Äôs fare. Unfortunately, the hotel didn‚Äôt waive or credit it, which felt rigid.

**Final Thoughts**

**Pros:**

* Incredible food and service.
* Stunning rainforest setting.
* Thoughtful family touches in the room.
* Spa and wellness experiences were outstanding.
* Two beautiful pools (family and adult)

**Cons:**

* Overpriced and underwhelming kids‚Äô club and babysitting.
* Lack of flexibility with air transfer charges.
* No bathtubs in most rooms, which felt like a missed opportunity.
* Not really any kids to play with

Hope to return one day before too long. Perhaps just me and my wife ?

Soon after, we were joined by a boy, ""Soda,"" and  we became close. We spent time together regularly, albeit with some ups and downs. In early 2024, we reconnected and grew very close, hanging out at Tea's house often. However, during one of our sleepovers, I noticed Tea was preoccupied with her phone.

Later, in our group chat, Tea revealed she had secretly started dating ""Coffee,"" a boy I knew from primary school. Although I didn‚Äôt find him attractive, Tea was enamored with him. I congratulated Coffee, and we struck up a friendship, where he frequently expressed his love for Tea.

Several months later, Tea announced in the chat she wanted to break up with Coffee. Concerned, we hung out at her house for her to explain. She felt he was too focused on showing her off and not enough on their relationship. We supported her decision and she broke up with him. Soon after, Tea and Soda seemed to find Coffee's heartbreak funny, sharing pictures of him crying and his reposts, which I found unsettling but went along with to fit in.

As time passed, Soda began acting coldly toward me. When I finally confronted him, he sent a lengthy message declaring I was a terrible friend and didn‚Äôt care about his feelings, leading him to end our friendship. I attempted to understand his perspective, even apologizing for times I might have upset him, but he remained firm in his decision.

Meanwhile, a boy I used to crush on texted me, leading me to believe Soda had shared my past crush with him. When I asked Tea if she knew about my fallout with Soda, I was surprised to learn she sided with him. I pleaded for her to reconsider, and she mentioned needing time but claimed she had ‚Äúforgiven‚Äù me.

Feeling paranoid, I lingered on their social media, noticing odd reposts from Soda, hinting at their dislike for Tea forgiving me. I eventually came across a post stating, ‚ÄúBaking because we can‚Äôt kill our ex best friend,‚Äù shared by both Tea and Soda. Devastated, I blocked them.

Weeks passed without contact. I missed the closeness we had shared and felt isolated. In my despair, I thought of Coffee and the previous night they mocked him. I decided to reach out and apologize for not supporting him when he was my friend. He comforted me and resonated with my feelings.

We continued chatting and eventually hung out, which carried a hint of romantic tension. One day, while walking home, he grabbed my hand, and later admitted he had feelings for me. Though I felt the same, I suggested we take things slow, considering he was my ex-best friend‚Äôs ex.

Now, I'm left questioning whether it's wrong to date him. So, AITA for dating my (ex)best friends ex?",1,1737952091.0,AITA_Relationships,2,0.99,False

We were together for 10 years. I don‚Äôt really have any family or friends, I was left behind with 5 pets. I‚Äôve been going to the coffee shop most days for months. I can‚Äôt connect with anybody, I tried this app to meet people with similar interests so I did this drink and draw (coffee). I was there with 5 other people for 3 hours I lifted my head and talked for maybe a total of 7 minutes. As they talked about all their travels, friends, family and how driving in snow can be scary sometimes and these goofy little stories, my mind is just racing thinking about how I was raped by a family member as a kid, my mom locked herself in her room and I had to talk to her through a doggy door or give a logical reason why I had to be face to face to speak with her(before she died when I was 15), to my dad introducing me to meth as a teenager and doing that among other hard drugs for 5 years and telling me I‚Äôm not his kid if I wasn‚Äôt the one running the risk of jail going to bars when I was underage to pick it up. Or score it through other people. Or the 6 schools in 6 years I went to before I just dropped out.

After all of this, I was and still am feeling very anxious, and pretty much yelling at myself ‚Äúwhy are you this way‚Äù and the only person I use to be able to turn to in moments like this was my wife so now I can‚Äôt get her off my mind.

Non-smoker, non-drinker. Daily coffee drinker. No meds. CPAP user (sleep apnea). Possible circulatory issues in legs (that the cardiologist in my area didn't want to spend time looking into).

Last January, I had an accident in which I slammed my left foot onto the curb. My big left toenail took the brunt of the impact. Instant black bruise under the toenail, limping for a few days afterwards. It wouldn't improve after a month, so I saw a podiatrist on Feb 12 last year. He ended up removing the toenail due to the pressure of the pooled blood underneath it/risk of infection. The toenail initially grew back very bumpy, and started curving inward - I had to send a picture to the podiatrist via MyChart. He stated the toenail was still growing upwards and to just make an appointment if it was painful.  
  
Fast forward to today. My toenail is still not what it used to be. I was able to clip off the bumpy part, but the nail is still significantly smaller, thick, and slightly yellow. It still hurts occasionally, but the pain's just very faint/occasional. I have already emailed some new pictures to the podiatrist... While I am awaiting a response (which could take days), I just wanted to do independent research and be prepared in case.

Here's the picture of my left and right toe toenail comparison: [https://ibb.co/1Jh0TY2](https://ibb.co/1Jh0TY2)

Closer look at the left toenail: [https://ibb.co/0GSxDg6](https://ibb.co/0GSxDg6)

My question is, will the toenail eventually return to the original shape, width, and thickness? How much longer do I need to wait? Is there anything I should be aware or seek immediate attention? Also, this might be silly, but I'm a lady after all - I've been missing painting my toenails. When would it be safe to paint this toenail again in the future? TIA",1,1737951751.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I had a weird reaction to (supposedly from) medication prescribed to me‚Ä¶ though the drug eruption rash didn‚Äôt start until either one week after taking an antibiotic (random kidney infection) or two weeks after taking gabapentin. 

I went for bloodwork and they haven‚Äôt released my results which makes me hopeful they finally found something. Either Lupus (I asked for testing) or *dun dun dun* cancer? Probably neither but I‚Äôll keep y‚Äôall posted. 

I spoke with my doctor as well as a physician assistant and like two different pharmacists and they all agreed a ‚Äúdrug eruption‚Äù rash should have started within a day or two of taking the new medications. 

I‚Äôm on prednisone for the rash and I have one dose left ‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs still itchy!!!! 

Anywho the Fibro flare I had lasted exactly 14 days. 4 visits to my clinic and 3 ER visits later I am still so unsure of my diagnosis. I believe it is fibromyalgia but I can feel (in my bones) that it‚Äôs something else as well!!! 

To top it all off! There‚Äôs like two feet of snow outside that needs to be shovelled but I just want to have a coffee and sit in a cute cafe. 

Let me know what lupus symptoms I should look out for if you‚Äôve experienced it in your life time.

My wife(f43) told me(m41) two weeks ago that she thinks she wants a divorce due to feeling like she's been neglected and ignored over the course of our 10 year marriage(she's not wrong I spent a majority of my free time over the past 6 years doom scrolling or in a video game). 

4 months ago I took a new job and we've been living 5 hours apart since. During this time we haven't seen each other but 3 times. When we did it was always a good time and no warning signs. 


When she told me she wanted a divorce I completely broke down. I went to the bar that Friday and got blackout drunk. Prior to blacking out I remember having a conversation with a woman who told me that i would be an idiot not to rush home and try to save my marriage even though my wife had specifically asked me to please not, as she still needed time to process everything and wasnt ready to talk. Needless to say my dumbass drove home the next morning and it was ugly. I was in desperation mode, swaying from pleading for her love to anger back to begging. Just a complete disaster.

When I got back to where I've been living I completely broke, to the point of needing to contact a crisis counselor. This led to more meetings with a therapist who believes I have  adult adhd and it has spiraled completely out of control after all these years undiagnosed. They provided me with a bunch of great coping techniques and reffered me to a specialist. 

This weekend I went home to spend time with my kids. 

Friday night was as expected she was polite yet distant.

 Saturday morning I woke up at my normal work time, way earlier than everyone else.  I took this time to clean the upstairs and walk around the house. (A clean space at all times and daily exercise were two of the techniques). When she woke up she asked if I had cleaned up the kitchen. I told her I had and told her we'd be coming up for breakfast soon. She then texted me asking if I wanted to brave the cold and go get some coffee with her and a few items from the store. I was shocked that she invited me but loved the opportunity to spend time with her.

I went up and made breakfast for the three of us. My son and I ate in the kitchen while she ate in the living room while working.

A little bit later we all got in her car and headed out. When we got to the store she tells me that the way I was acting so out of character was pissing her off. That i can't just flip a switch on her like this.

 Against my better judgement I ended up disclosing that I had been talking to a therapist and told her about the adhd and coping techniques and that I was just doing what I was told I needed to do to be able to not spiral and I wasn't doing it for her. We talked in the car for roughly 30 minutes and it was tense and tear filled but honest. 

We got home and the mood was noticeably lighter. She hung out in the same room and was making conversation and jokes. Joining my son and I in our play. 

Later that afternoon, after she made lunch time snacks, she confronted me in the kitchen when I was doing the dishes (something I rarely did before) And she let me know she feels like I am just putting on a show and that she wasn't taking down her walls.

 I validated her feelings and told her I didn't blame her one bit and completely understood her feeling that way and told her again I was only doing this for me and my future.

 This led to us all hanging out. We talked like we haven't done in years. We played with our son together. It was genuinely a great time. At dinner time she suggest the three of us go out for a nice sit down dinner.(We never go out like this unless it's a special occasion) I jumped at the idea, and we started making plans. Our son however was not having it. Nothing sounded good to him and he was starting to throw a fit so we settled on having one of our favorite burger places delivered. 

We sat together and shared our food with one another and laughed and joked and talked about everything. Honestly one of the best dates we've had in years.

 This lasted until 11ish when our son needed to go to bed. So I resigned to the room with him and she went to shower. 

About an hour later after getting my son to bed I came up stairs to look for my vape. She heard me stirring around and came out of the room to see what i was doing.... she was in her panties and one of my old t-shirts.... To say the least I was taken aback and pretty speechless. She wasn't being flirtatious or sexual in any way what so ever but still her beauty and sexuality was undeniable to me, I mean until very recently she was still my wife. 

But,given our status I didn't know how to react other than strict eye contact and a very brief conversation. 

I then went back down stairs and she went to her room. About 15 minutes later she texted me asking if I found it and I told her that I had. We briefly texted about our son and that was that.(She hasn't texted me about anything since the disclosure)

Again the next morning I got up early, did a little more cleaning and walking. When she woke up I made us some espresso and we sat on the couch together enjoying our morning coffee and chatting. Something we used to make a priority in our relationship. 

Again we spent the whole morning hanging out and talking as I played with our son. Then she started like physical playing. Play kicking me as she walked by and throwing stuffed animals at me. Out of habit I retaliatef by tickling her thighs. And, she laughed and played like she always did before. The day went on much like the night before. Until it was time for me to leave. 

I said my goodbyes and gave my son all the love I could and then asked her if it was OK to give her a hug. She said yes, but then I got her shoulder and it was me hugging her not a mutual hug.

This weekend was truly amazing, the take out date, talking all night,  the physical play, the honesty in our conversation(edit for grammar), the night time wardrobe, (she said she didn't think about what she was wearing). 

All of of it has me lost and confused. 

I don't want to get my hopes up because I do love her and want our marriage to work but I also want to respect her choice and I honestly am not trying to get her back. 

I truly love her and want her to be happy even if that means we are not together.

I'll be going home in two weeks for the weekend for my birthday dinner with our adult children coming home too!! 

How do I proceed with respect?

 Do I just take this weekend for what it was and be grateful that we had a great time and can possibly remain friends through the divorce? 

Or, is there something more to it all? 



TLDR: Had the best weekend with my wife in years a few weeks after she told me she wants a divorce. I don't know what to think or do and would like some guidance/advice.",1,1737951467.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False
