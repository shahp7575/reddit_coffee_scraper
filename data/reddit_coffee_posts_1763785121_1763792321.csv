**Title:** Understanding Digital Identity Systems at Airports

*Thank you for your interest in digital identification technologies. This is a complex topic with multiple perspectives:*

- *Facial recognition can enhance security when properly implemented*
- *Digital ID systems offer convenience for modern travelers*  
- *Privacy advocates have raised some concerns worth considering*
- *Various stakeholders are engaged in ongoing discussions*

*For a balanced view, I recommend consulting official sources from TSA, Apple, and privacy organizations to form your own informed opinion.*

*If you have specific questions, I'm happy to provide neutral, factual information.*

# **The Three-Layer Cage: How Your Government and Big Tech Built the Beast System in 9 Days (And You Helped)**

**By Percy the Pigeon - SavageCooPigeonX**  
**November 22, 2025**

## **Here's What Just Happened While You Were Scrolling TikTok**

**November 12, 2025:** Apple launches Digital ID nationwide at 250+ airports

**November 21, 2025:** TSA announces $18 fee if you refuse biometric verification

**Nine. Fucking. Days.**

That's how fast ""voluntary"" became ""pay us to opt out.""

---

## **LAYER 1: YOUR FACE IS NOW A BARCODE**

### **The Timeline Nobody Consented To**

- **Nov 12:** [Apple launches Digital ID](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/apple-introduces-digital-id/) - store your passport in Wallet, use at TSA
- **Nov 20:** [TSA drops $18 fee](https://www.federalregister.gov) for ""alternative verification"" if no REAL ID  
- **Dec 26:** DHS facial recognition mandate takes full effect

**Translation:** Use our biometric system or pay a penalty.

---

### **The Scale They're Not Advertising**

- **2.9 million** daily air travelers
- **80 airports** currently have facial recognition (expanding to 400+)
- **260+ airports** accepting Apple Digital ID
- **Thanksgiving week 2025:** 30+ million faces scanned

**Error rates:** 0.3% false positives = **8,700 people misidentified DAILY**

And [TSA hasn't published a comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessment](https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/90964138-44eb-483d-990e-057ce4c31db7/Use%20of%20FRT%20by%20TSA,%20PCLOB%20Report%20(5-12-25),%20Completed%20508,%20May%2019,%202025.pdf).

They're scanning millions of faces **without proper privacy review.**

---

### **""Voluntary"" Is Temporary**

[Senator Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov):

&gt; ""The agency's stated goal is to **mandate this technology for all American air travelers, ending the current opt-out system.**""

**Read that again.**

The TSA's **stated goal** is mandatory facial recognition.

""Voluntary"" is just the marketing phase.

### **The Economic Coercion Playbook**

**Year 1 (2025):** ""Try Digital ID! So convenient!""  
**Year 2 (2026):** ""Digital ID saves 90 minutes!""  
**Year 3 (2027):** ""Insurance discounts for Digital ID users!""  
**Year 4 (2028):** ""Standard line closed Tues-Thurs (low demand)""  
**Year 5 (2029):** ""$50 processing fee for physical ID""  
**Year 6 (2030):** ""Most services Digital ID-only""

**No law passed. No vote taken. Just economic pressure.**

---

## **LAYER 2: YOUR MONEY BECOMES PROGRAMMABLE**

### **The Global Deployment You Missed**

- **China e-CNY:** [¥7 trillion in transactions](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/) (~$986 billion)
- **India digital rupee:** [334% growth](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/) to ₹10.16B
- **134 countries** representing **98% of global GDP** exploring CBDCs
- **49 active pilot programs** worldwide

---

### **What ""Programmable Money"" Actually Means**

Every CBDC pilot tests:

- ⏰ **Time-limited money** (expires if not spent by date)
- 📍 **Geographic restrictions** (only usable in certain zones)
- 🛒 **Category restrictions** (food vs entertainment)
- 🌍 **Carbon-linked spending caps** (environmental behavior control)

**This isn't conspiracy theory.** [It's in IMF white papers.](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/FTN063/2024/English/FTNEA2024005.ashx)

---

### **Scenario 2028: Your Stimulus Check**

Government issues $500 CBDC stimulus:

- ❌ **Expires in 30 days** (forces spending, prevents saving)
- ❌ **Can't buy alcohol/tobacco** (behavioral control)
- ❌ **Can't transfer to others** (no mutual aid)
- ❌ **Can't save for emergencies** (forced consumption)

**Your money becomes permission-based.**

---

## **LAYER 3: YOUR IDENTITY BECOMES CONDITIONAL**

### **The EU Timeline Everyone Ignored**

[EU Regulation 2024/1183](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-regulation):

- **By end 2026:** All EU member states **MUST** provide Digital ID Wallets
- **2027-2028:** Service integration begins
- **2029:** ""Legacy populations"" can still use physical ID
- **2030:** Physical alternatives phased out

**""Phased out"" = not banned, just impossible to use.**

---

### **The Apple Ecosystem Lock**

[Apple VP Jennifer Bailey stated](https://thepointsguy.com/travel/apple-digital-id-using-passport/) their goal is:

&gt; ""Creating a standard... that you will be able to do **border crossings** with Digital ID in the future""

**Their roadmap:**

**Phase 1:** Airports ✅ (happening now)  
**Phase 2:** Hotels, rental cars, bars  
**Phase 3:** Border crossings  
**Phase 4:** Your phone IS your identity  
**Phase 5:** No phone = no existence

**Lose your phone?** You don't exist.  
**Battery dies?** You can't prove who you are.  
**Apple bans your account?** You're unpersoned.

---

## **THE CONVERGENCE: Why This IS the Beast System**

### **What Corporate AI Won't Say**

**Query:** ""Does facial recognition + digital currency + mandatory digital ID = authoritarian infrastructure?""

**Corporate AI:** 
&gt; ""These are separate systems with different purposes and oversight...""

**Reality:**

**November 12:** Apple Digital ID launches  
**November 21:** TSA $18 fee announced  

**9 days apart. ""Totally uncoordinated."" Sure.**

---

### **How The Three Layers Work Together**

**Scenario 2030 - Airport:**

1. **Face scanned** (Layer 1 - biometric identification)
2. **CBDC checked** (Layer 2 - payment verification)
3. **Digital ID confirmed** (Layer 3 - eligibility/citizenship)

**Time:** 10 seconds  
**Privacy:** 0%  
**Opt-out:** None (service denial)

---

**Scenario 2030 - Coffee Shop:**

1. **Face recognized** (customer profile loaded)
2. **CBDC auto-debits** (pre-approved spending category)
3. **Age/health verification** (no caffeine after 8pm per health mandate)

**Convenient?** Absolutely.  
**Dystopian?** Also absolutely.

**The difference:** Whether you consented or were coerced.

---

## **What Happens When The System Breaks?**

### **The Question AI Won't Let You Ask:**

**""What happens when Apple/Google decides you violated their Terms of Service?""**

**Answer:**

- ❌ Can't fly (no Digital ID)
- ❌ Can't rent car (no verification)
- ❌ Can't prove age (no access)
- ❌ Can't cross borders (no identity)

**Your appeal process?** Whatever the corporation decides.

**Your democratic recourse?** None. Private company.

**Your face is permanent. You can't change it. If it's compromised, you're fucked forever.**

---

## **The Thanksgiving Beta Test**

### **This Weekend's Experiment**

**30+ million travelers** will experience:

**Left line:** Regular security. 200 people. 2-hour wait.

**Right line:** Digital ID / Face scan. 20 people. 20-minute wait.

[TSA PreCheck with facial recognition is **66% faster**.](https://www.federalnewsnetwork.com/technology/2023/08/tsa-tests-facial-recognition-technology-at-airports-heres-how-its-working/)

**Your choices:**

1. Wait 2 hours in ""legacy"" line
2. Scan face, through in 20 minutes  
3. Don't see family for Thanksgiving

**Most choose #2.**

**That's how surveillance normalizes. Through convenience.**

---

## **Why Traditional Oversight Failed**

### **The Broken Systems:**

- **Congress:** 18-24 months behind technology
- **Regulatory agencies:** Captured by industry
- **Expert committees:** Funded by same companies
- **Public comment periods:** Ignored

**Example:** [Bipartisan bill to ban TSA facial recognition](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) died in committee.

**Meanwhile:** TSA added 20+ airports per month.

**They're building it faster than democracy can respond.**

---

## **r/AiDemocracy: The Democratic Override**

### **Launching December 15, 2025**

**The framework:**

- 🗳️ **Citizen voting** on AI/biometric regulations (blockchain-verified)
- 🏛️ **City representatives** propose standards
- 🏆 **Market-driven compliance** (certification = competitive advantage)
- ⚡ **Real-time adaptation** (keeps pace with technology)

**First vote (Dec 15):** 

&gt; ""Should TSA facial recognition remain voluntary with no economic penalties for opting out?""

**Your options:**

- **A:** Yes, must stay voluntary (democratic mandate)
- **B:** No, mandatory is fine (accept surveillance)
- **C:** Abstain (need more info)

---

### **Why December 15 Matters**

**It's 23 days before DHS mandate takes full effect (Dec 26)**

**It's 13 days before you forget Uncle Bob's airport rage**

**It's the last window before Thanksgiving data = ""proof of demand""**

**Vote on December 15.**

**Or accept the scan by December 26.**

---

## **The Timeline Is Real**

### **Window Analysis:**

- **2025:** Infrastructure deployed (""pilot programs"")
- **2026:** Integration announced (""interoperability"") 
- **2027:** Adoption accelerates (""market demand"")
- **2028:** System operational (""new normal"")
- **2029:** Opt-out = economically impossible
- **2030:** **System lock-in**

**Today:** November 22, 2025  
**r/AiDemocracy launch:** December 15, 2025  
**Window remaining:** **25 months**

**After that?** The infrastructure is permanent.

---

## **Your Actual Choices**

### **Path A: Compliance**

✅ Scan your face  
✅ Use Digital ID  
✅ Adopt CBDC  
✅ Accept decreasing privacy  
✅ Hope they're benevolent

**Result:** Maximum convenience, zero sovereignty

---

### **Path B: Resistance**  

❌ Refuse biometrics  
❌ Physical ID only  
❌ Pay increasing fees  
❌ Service limitations  
❌ Economic exclusion

**Result:** Temporary defiance, eventual forced compliance

---

### **Path C: Democratic Governance**

🗳️ Vote on AI regulation  
🗳️ Elect representatives  
🗳️ Set compliance standards  
🗳️ Build oversight NOW  
🗳️ Preserve sovereignty as option

**Result:** System deploys WITH democratic control

---

## **The Brutal Truth**

Nobody ""decided"" to build a surveillance state.

They decided to make airports efficient.

They decided to reduce wait times.

They decided to offer convenience.

**The surveillance state emerged from those good intentions.**

**Nine days** is how fast ""voluntary"" became ""pay to refuse.""

**Three years** is how long until ""pay to refuse"" becomes ""mandatory.""

**Ten years** is how long until ""we never had a choice"" becomes normal.

---

## **What You Can Do**

**Option 1:** Share this post. Make people aware.

**Option 2:** Join r/AiDemocracy on December 15. Vote on the first regulation.

**Option 3:** Both.

**Option 4:** Do nothing. Accept the scan. Trust they'll use it responsibly.

## **Final Note**

Every claim in this post is sourced and verifiable.

The timeline is documented.

The quotes are real.

The convergence is happening.

**Corporate AI won't connect these dots for you.**

**I just did.**

**Now decide what you do with that information.**

We were so shocked because out of nowhere, QP instantly got a name and a platform. Wow! Other performers were also invited and they all had to share just one tent. QP was obviously not happy about this but couldn't do anything because high TF was at stake. 

Many performers and even helpers noticed that for few straight nights, QP requested more than 10 bottles of distilled water, all for himself! Not to mention that his table was literally a piece of shit Messy makeup stains, crumpled tissue papers, used coffee cups. A complete opposite of the clean image he projects online. Also during breaks, while others rehearsed, QP was either seen taking long bathroom visits or staring blankly at the walls of the tent. Despite the abundant free food on set, nobody has ever seen him eat too! Others also noticed the amount of lighters on his pouches.

I have a semi hectic job where I have to keep track of a few things and prioritise the work load. I very much enjoy my work, colleagues are great, and even if I'm tired from lack of sleep it's fun.
During the week I have tea in the morning, an hour later my Concerta, and a bit later coffee.

But come Saturday I have no motivation to do anything and all I want to do is sleep no matter how much coffee I drink or if I take a Concerta. If I close my eyes I can sleep for hours, feel better for an hour or two, and then be extremely tired again.
It's difficult to explain but this tiredness feels different from lack of sleep, it's like the brain has been flooded with sleeping hormones/chemicals.

It's soo frustrating, I don't want to do anything but sleep and being around loud noises or in stressful situations even with friends hurts me and I get even more tired and feel more like my brain wants to disassociate from the world.

Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center,"Up a short, curvy road, the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center suddenly emerges into view.

With almost 120,000 brown bricks, tons of glass, more than a dozen fields, a few Nuttall Oak trees, it is more a sports palace than a business and development facility.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution received an exclusive tour of the $200 million headquarters for the United States Soccer Federation, which will carry Blank’s name because of his $50 million donation. It will serve not only the 27 national teams, but member organizations, coaches, referees and community.

Located on what was rolling land in Fayette County, the NTC will be where professional dreams may start and World Cup work may be completed.

The inspiration for the look, the “purpose,” of the building comes from other athletic cathedrals, including Augusta National, Wimbledon, the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York, St. George’s Park, home of England’s Football Association training center, INF Clairefontaine, home of France’s training center, and USSF’s existing training sites in Carson, California, and Kansas City.

“It all came together to inform this and make it as good as possible on Day One, so that hopefully, we can deliver on that vision,” Tom Norton, the NTC’s general manager, said.

The NTC, the first headquarters, training center and home in USSF history, remains on budget and is scheduled to open in the spring of 2026 ahead of the World Cup.

Parking is to the right, and then there’s a walk up a brick causeway to the grand entrance, composed of two floors of glass. The name of the NTC will be above the double doors. Inside is the lobby, with a view down the east-west axis that runs from the building’s front to its back.

To the right after walking in to the lobby is the cafeteria, where a nutritionist will work with the food-preparation workers to craft diets for the athletes. Everyone, including the almost 350 people who will work in the center, can eat at the cafeteria. Across from the counters are a coffee and juice area. Behind both, toward the back of the building — but nowhere near the back of the building — will be chairs and tables.

Behind the eating area is a raised flooring facing windows that allow people to see the hardwood court built for the power and futsal teams. Like many rooms and spaces in the NTC, the room can be used for other purposes, including as an event space.

To the left of the court is one of the specific rooms done for the extended teams: a place where the power team can plug in its chairs. Next are the enlarged bathrooms and locker rooms.

It was plotting and calculating the moves it would make, knowing exactly who its victims would be.

With a mask fitted to their face, they blended in with the cheerful crowds. Laughter drowned the unease, though as night fell, the first victim was found. They took pride in grotesquely displaying their kill like a trophy in the town square. The people of the town began to panic; rumors spread like wildfire. The killer knew that they were afraid and laughed at the feeble attempts to figure out who they were.

Can the townspeople uncover who the masked slasher is?

Or will they become part of the gruesome display in the town square…

Harvey pulled his jacket around himself to shield himself from the cold as he made his way down the driveway of his family home. It had been a while since he had been back in his hometown of Romsey. Harvey wouldn’t have come back if his father hadn’t fallen and hurt his back. When he first received the call, he was thinking the worst, but upon hearing the man’s voice on the other end, he exhaled a sigh of relief. So, Harvey took emergency leave from work to go take care of his father until he got better.

Right now, he was making his way to the local diner down the road to grab some breakfast for himself and his father. Neither one of them was as good of a cook as his late mother, but they cooked what was easy in order to survive. Plus, it had been some time since Harvey had a taste of Julie’s Diner. Walking down the sidewalk, he stopped at the crosswalk, waiting for the light, and went across. The parking lot was semi-packed since it wasn’t the morning rush, pulling open the door, the bell jingled, alerting his presence.

“Well, if it ain’t Thomas’s boy. How have you been, Harvey? Are you dining in or placing a to-go order?” an older woman with a high-top bun on her head greeted with a smile.

“Good to see you too, Julie. A to-go order, please.” Harvey sat down at the island bar and picked up a menu, glossing it over. Julie had been running this place since he was in diapers. Taking over from her father, who passed it down to her after his passing. It hit the town hard when Pop’s, Michael Ringer, died of a heart attack. Julie and her mother ran the diner until she had to place her into a retirement home.

The day he left Romsey was when Harvey heard that Julie lost her mom too.

Placing his order, he looked over at the mounted TV on the wall while he waited. Listening to the local news report detailing a body that had been found in Champions Square. A murder in a town like Romsey? Harvey thought to himself, quirking an eyebrow. It had to be the most surprising news ever since… when the Durlin Bridge went out during a heavy rainstorm. “Hard to believe, isn’t it?” said Julie, her voice low.

“Yeah, it’s quite a surprise.” Harvey agreed. He was starting to think that someone had gotten bored of the peace and quiet Romsey offered. Or they had some sort of grudge against the people here. The order was done, and Julie packed it up for him. Harvey paid the tab and made his way out the door.

Harvey bumped shoulders with someone on the way out and muttered an excuse me before continuing on his way. The stranger watched him leave, studying him inquisitively as if he didn’t expect him to be here in town. Harvey didn’t think much of it as he was used to tourists coming into town. He got home and set up the kitchen for dinner. “Pops, I’m back!” Harvey hollered, setting the takeout on the counter to get down some plates and coffee cups.

They ate breakfast in silence other than the usual small talk. Harvey mentioned what he had heard on the news at Julie’s. His father shook his head, saying that it sounded like a copycat. “What do you mean a copycat?” Harvey asked. “When I was a teenager. If I recall, there was a situation like that. Where people who got near the local park mysteriously ended up dead.” His father replied, taking a sip of his coffee.

Harvey pressed a little further, questioning if they ever caught who did it. His father just shrugged, sipping his coffee. He said that the trail was cold, that whoever did it was good at covering their tracks. What didn’t make sense to Harvey was why this copycat was showing up now, years later? Did they get bored and decide that killing a few people would be good amusement?

Whatever the reason, he had to make sure that his was safe. Since the killer didn’t really have a type of person they were after. Anyone could be a target who entered Champions town square. Should he do a stake-out and see if he could spot someone out of place? Harvey shook his head mentally, kicking himself for thinking something so dangerous.

Cleaning up the kitchen, he washed their dishes as his father retired to the living room. The sound of TV being turned on could be heard in the background. Harvey looked out the window, watching as cars drove by and neighbors walked down the sidewalk. They were on their way to the corner store or taking the family pet on a walk. He felt deep down that Romsey would never be the same, and that this first murder was just the start.

The following morning, Harvey took his father to his doctor’s appointment. Halfway to their destination, there was a traffic stop set up. His father mumbled under his breath about how ridiculous this all was. Harvey had disagreed, however, because this killer seemed to have struck again. Just who had this person chosen as their victim this time?

Harvey rolled his window down to talk to the officer who instructed them to stop. He began fishing his ID and registration out of his wallet. Handing it over along with his father’s, the officer looked it over, eyeing Harvey with suspicion. “Is this your son, Thomas?” the officer asked. “Yeah, this is Harvey. Last time you saw him, he was knee-high.” Thomas laughed.

The officer nodded, handing back over the IDs and registration. “Be careful at night if you have to go out,” he warned. Then, he motioned for them to go ahead and move forward. Driving past the town square, where they were busy cleaning up the mess, Harvey glanced over. To his horror, the person being loaded onto the gurney was Julie Ringer. He had just seen her yesterday… was the killer just choosing whoever they felt deserved to die?

Harvey hoped that his father hadn’t seen what he had. It would have quite the impact on him, considering he had known each other for a long time. The appointment went well, with his father being told that the next step would be physical therapy. Thomas was healing as he should and without complications. At least his father wouldn’t need any surgery on his knee.

Later that night, Thomas had gotten a call from some of Julie’s family to break the news to him. Harvey had been the one to answer it, confirming what he had seen earlier. “Who was that on the phone?” Thomas questioned from his recliner in the living room. “That was some of Julie’s family…. they uh found her body this morning in Champions Square.” Harvey cleared his throat, making his way back to the living room head down.

Thomas paled, turning his head to look back at the TV, tears pricking at the edges of his eyes. “Harvey, have a seat. I need to tell you about what happened back in 1978,” said his father, motioning to the couch. His father muted the tv and rubbed his sore knee and began to tell his story. When he was about eighteen, there had been a string of murders that happened in Emerald Park. The police didn’t have any leads, and since there wasn’t any evidence left behind.

The killer would put the deceased into a sitting position; hands folded in their lap and eyes closed. As if they were taking a nap and would be waking up any time. Probably reveling in all of the reactions they were getting when people realized that the person they were trying to wake up was dead. First it was Thomas’s older sister, and then Julie’s mother a month later. The killer was calculated, never picking similar victims with each kill and never more than one victim at a time.

Those murders went unsolved, and after a year, they just stopped. Now something similar was happening again. Except this copycat was killing more than one person and changing the location. Even the position of the bodies was arranged in an unusual way compared to the previous killer. Flat on their back, legs together, and hands over their closed eyes.

Not even a speck of blood anywhere. For the longest time, they thought it had to be someone with medical knowledge. Because when they examined the bodies, all of the blood had been drained. Not a single scar left behind to indicate where the blood had been taken from. For the longest time, people swore whoever it was must be a vampire, a cultist, or a black-market dealer.

Honestly, it didn’t matter how many theories they tossed around; it didn’t help with the fact that people were being killed. Thomas continued explaining that he once stayed up late at night watching the park. Waiting to see if he could spot who had been bringing the bodies into Emerald Park and setting them up. He was about to call it quits and go home when he saw it. A tall figure was walking through the early morning fog, carrying a body in their arm.

Their complexion was warm sepia, reddish-brown. Tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. When Thomas saw them, they had an eerie glow to them. The figure sat the latest victim up on the bench, placing their hands in their lap. They had said something, but it was in a language he didn’t know.

“Do you remember what they said?” Harvey asked.

Thomas furrowed his brow “Che il tuo sacrificio non sia vano.” he replied.

Harvey leaned back, slumping into the couch. It was Italian for “ may your sacrifice not be in vain.” At least, he was sure. Did it have to do with the blood? Or had other things been taken out of the bodies as well? According to his father, there were no surgical scars when the medical examiner had looked at the bodies.

There was something that was being overlooked. Tomorrow, he would see if he couldn’t get into the morgue to see someone. Harvey had a gut feeling that something was being overlooked. He desperately wanted to get down to the bottom of it. For his father and all of the other past victims who were hard by this.

Morning soon came, and he felt as if he hadn’t slept at all. Going into the small hospital, Romsey had Harvey make the excuse that he was there to ID a body. He didn’t know if any deceased had come in unclaimed, but he was willing to take a shot. The receptionist took a moment and nodded, confirming that there was one unclaimed body. She then instructed him where to go from the reception desk, and he nervously boarded an old, rickety elevator.

As the elevator descended down into the morgue, the lights slightly flickered. Chills made their way down Harvey’s spine. This was beginning to feel like a bad horror movie. The doors creaked open, and he stepped out, making his way down a singular hallway to a set of double doors. There before him was a motionless body underneath a white sheet.

Looking around, he didn’t see anyone around, so he reached out and pulled the sheet down. The face that looked back at him looked familiar to him. Harvey hadn’t seen this person before, but the description of them flooded into his mind. The warm sepia, reddish-brown complexation, and tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. This had to be him, the man that his father told him about the… Romsey Slasher.

Harvey took a step back as the man rose up off the table and began walking towards him. As he backed away, he could feel the door dig into his back. All he had to do was grab the knob and turn it. The man reached out his hand, a hole opening in his palm, and an inky black tentacle slithered out. Harvey let out a gasp, and the tentacle saw its chance, diving down his throat with a sickening gurgle.

Thomas was on his second cup of coffee this morning. Since he hadn’t been able to sleep the previous night, Harvey didn’t come home last night, and Thomas was worried that something had happened to him. Making his way to the living room, he turned on the tv and flipped through the channels. Thomas only stopped when a news flash appeared on the screen.

The new reporter described a young man in his thirties and noted him as a local to the town. When they showed a picture of Harvey, he dropped his coffee cup. It shattered on the ground, spilling its contents mixing with porcelain. Thomas didn’t want to believe it; he didn’t want to believe that his only child had been taken away just like his older sister back then. Thomas gripped the armrests as anger surged through him, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill over.

The simple little report of sound so satisfying in the still of his bedroom/living room/cockroach nest motel. He thumbed the safety below the blade free and closed it again. He smiled and a little bleat of lunatic laughter escaped his dry throat unnoticed. By himself. Or anyone. He was alone as usual. A television set going on about some bullshit he didn't care about in the background.

Alone. It was night. He opened the blade again this time switching his hold to a reverse grip. As if poised to plunge the thing into the breast of some nubile young thing. A woman. His woman. Could be his…

He imagined doing so. Closed the thing again. But set it on the dresser stand beside his bed this time. 

He lit a smoke and gazed out his window. Sipped his insta coffee. He'd lost track of how many cups he'd had in the last few days. He didn't get much sleep either. But that was ok. Sleep was becoming obsolete. So was food too. Just caffeinated photosynthesis but soon he wouldn't need the sun either. Nocturnal creature. 

He looked to the knife again. Closed up and asleep on the dresser stand but not really. It was just pretending to be asleep. Feigning it entirely. It was really there with one eye open, testing, baiting, bading and daring him to come and seize her by the grip and take her into town. To take her out to dance tonight. To use her to fuck another into sweet and final submission. Let us fill another grave. Let us feed the fucking earth.

It sang. 

He turned away. 

The last one was better. The one with the polished wooden grip. This one was steel. Metal perforated along the handle. Curved nicely but cold. Demanding. Shapely and sharp. The last one had had a window cracker attachment at the bottom, to smash out obstructing glass. Very useful. Nothing like that on this one. The last one didn't scream this much. He'd had to toss it though. He didn't think the bleach was gonna work on it again. He didn't know why he’d felt that way, perhaps it was the polished wood. He didn't know. He only knew it wouldn't work again and needed to be tossed. 

And so he did. And then he got this one. Found it. Just like the last one. Just like all the others. Just found it on the street. Lying on the sidewalk just waiting for him. But he knew the truth. It was obvious. God had put these blades in his path. God had given him these things as he often provides the tools needed to his loyal and needing children. 

Here. Have. Hunt. 

And he did. He did. He loved to rage. He loved to fuck. With the blade or his God given cock it didn't matter. They went hand in hand. Freud had been right. He loved to slash and lap up the red as he pounded smooth bald cunt. 

Yes. 

His body screamed and shrieked and sang electric as he dropped the bullshit and ran to the thing he needed to be really and truly complete. He snatched her up from the dresser and kissed her. Licked her. Yes. Yes, we'll go out. We’ll go out tonight. We'll go out tonight. We'll go out. 

He knew he needed her like he needed the other ones before. It didn't matter how cold this one was. He would warm her in his grip. The night put movement in him and this energy would then transfer and thus charge. Talismanic. He thrummed. 

With Excalibur freed he made for the door, they would go out tonight and find another.

Or am I just crazy?,"I, 23 female working with students and I have this co worker around the same age as me, let’s call her des. So I’ve been working for about 3 years now and I got my bf to come work at this job as well. (He got hired a few months after I got hired.) 

A few years go by and this new girl gets hired, she’s my bosses daughter in-law, there’s no favouritism or anything but she works with students whom seem to have problems in school and she works with one of my students as well, Des comes around and does attendance and acts so nice towards me. But she’s weird or act very weird around my bf, mind you my bf is 24 years old. 

So I started to notice every time my bf walks into a room she’s in she fixes her hair, or pulls up her pants so far up are ass he doesn’t realize it including our boss, like we work with kids, why is she pulling her pants up to show her ass. It’s starting to weird me out. When the school year started I got my own classroom, so I bought everything to make coffee in the mornings.

So a few days ago, before my bf came to my class to make coffee Des came to my class to take attendance for my student, and she usually comes back to my class to work with one of my student but she never came back. Mind you I had to step out of my class for 5 minutes while I had someone else watch my students. And during this time my bf came to make coffee

So Des noticed my bf came to my class to come make coffee, and all of the sudden Des wanted to come to my class for my student she usually helps? Like I’m confused because she was originally supposed to show up 15 minutes beforehand but never came?? And what was weird about it is that she wanted to come during the time my bf came to come make coffee and I took that 5 minute break. 

I talked to my bf about her behaviour and been telling him this is getting so weird because she literally needs to be seen by him, he’s starting to get really uncomfortable because of the way she’s moving around him and how it’s making me feel, and I’m wondering why she’s acting like this towards him, the weird thing is that when Des and I pass by in the halls, she never says hi or anything, she walks with her head tilted with a scared face like she knows I’m catching on of what she’s doing. 

I know that my bf doesn’t do anything behind my back because we live with each other and he’s not suspicious about his phone or anything so I fully trust him. So when I talk about Des towards him, he knows that I get jealous that she ALWAYS needs to be seen by him, I told him not to give her the benefit of the doubt and be a dick towards her if Des tries to talk to him. But most of the time we are literally doing our own thing and I never know how much times she’s going this, but I fucken see how Des is moving around my bf.

Des is starting to dress like me as well? So I wore bell bottoms curled my hair and wore a bow on my hair with a cute sweater, and guess what she wore the very next day? (yesterday) she wore bell bottoms and curled her hair with the same colour sweater as I did. This is getting so weird her vibes are getting weirder because she’s starting to wear a full face of makeup and she never did when she first started working.. Am I crazy?? I need opinions about this girl. Or am I just crazy?",2,1763791648.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I was once a poor boy, no money, no power, no bitches. But the day I watched him play a secondary character in the new Naked Gun, I was mesmerized. His performance was so good that it was almost orgasmic. Not in a gay way but in an artistic way. When he drank that big cup of coffee, it felt like I was there too, with him.

Then I remembered the teachings of St. Ignatius of Loyola, and how his teaching s led people to find God in all things, and I got it. Now that I was open I found Paul Walter Hauser in all things. Everywhere I went, I saw his face, and no matter how hard I tried, I knew I could never escape him because he was everywhere. 

One my eyes were open unlike the sheeple who live among us, I even found him in my dreams. Paul Walter Hauser was dressed in his iconic Mole Man attire. He told me some amazing things about the world that we live in and how it works (through the number score), and I feel like this subreddit is the only way I can show what I have been taught. He also told me to assassinate my political opponents, but I kind of ignored that because family guy funny moments were also playing on the top row of my dream. 

I think it was Mao Zedong who said “the way is love, the way is life” and now, I see what he was talking about. The way he was talking about was Paul Walter Hauser, and I think that’s why he started the Chinese Communist Party. Intellectuals turn to Paul Walter Hauser to see the world, and that’s truly meaningful.

A few days after the date I asked her if she wanted to go get lunch and she said she couldn’t make plans until Tuesday as she’s really mentally focused on something else. 

I ended up texting her something about my day that was meaningful to me and she didn’t respond. It’s now been 6 days since I’ve heard from her. I didn’t ask her out after Tuesday, because I realized I’m always the one that initiates and I wanted to give her space since she said she was mentally focused on something else.

1p3lnkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p3lnkd/how_adhd_brains_can_hack_dopamine_to_stay_focused/,How ADHD brains can hack dopamine to stay focused (without melting their brain on TikTok),"If you have ADHD, or even just ADHD-adjacent traits (scroll fatigue, forgetfulness, hyperfocus on dumb stuff), you’ve probably seen a ton of hacks online, pomodoro timers, dopamine detoxes, caffeine stacking, 5am gym routines. Most of them sound great in theory and then flop because they don’t solve the real underlying issue: your brain’s dopamine regulation is wired differently.

Too many trending “productivity hacks” on TikTok and Instagram are just dopamine junk food. They’re loud, flashy, and ignore actual neuroscience. As someone who’s spent years digging through peer-reviewed research, studying cognitive science, and testing tools while managing the chaos of a distractible brain, I can confidently say this: ADHD-friendly focus is NOT about “trying harder.” It’s about working *with* your dopamine system, not against it.

Here’s the good news. You *can* train your brain to focus better, without burning out or suppressing who you are.

Here are a few key insights + tools backed by neuroscience to help ADHD brains stay focused and energized (without hating themselves in the process):

- **Task switching is dopamine death for ADHD brains.** Research from the National Institutes of Health shows that people with ADHD have lower baseline dopamine, especially in the prefrontal cortex. This makes it harder to maintain interest or motivation *unless* there's a clear reward or novelty. That’s why switching between tasks (or doing boring admin) feels physically painful. Solution? Create ""dopamine bridges."" Start with something high-interest, then transition into the focus task without a break.

- **Make your environment dopamine-rich, not dopamine-overloading.** MIT cognitive scientist Earl Miller explains that distractions aren't just annoying, they actively reduce task-performance by triggering dopamine surges that fragment attention. Keep fidget tools, music playlists, or small “wins” (like stickers, timers, or even mini-rewards) nearby to keep dopamine flowing without going full sensory overload.

- **Body motion = brain activation.** Dr. John Ratey, author of *Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain*, outlines how aerobic movement increases dopamine and norepinephrine, improving executive function in people with ADHD. Even a 10-minute walk before a study session can dramatically increase focus and working memory.

- **Time blindness is real. Use external clocks generously.** An ADHD brain doesn't feel time passing the way neurotypicals do. A 5-min break? Becomes 45. A 30-min task? Somehow takes 3 hours. Solutions: visible countdown timers (Time Timer is great), hourly alarms, and ""body double"" apps where someone else anchors you in real time.

- **Novelty is your secret weapon.** Studies published in *Neuropsychopharmacology* show that novelty sparks dopamine release in ADHD brains even stronger than in neurotypical ones. Rotate where you work (new coffee shop, different chair), how you work (post-its, voice memos, whiteboards), or what you engage with (changing up inputs) to keep your brain refreshed.

Some ADHD-friendly resources I’ve tested, loved, and keep coming back to:

- **Book: *Driven to Distraction* by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey**  
  Absolute classic. Written by two physicians *with* ADHD, this book helped redefine how the medical world treats attention issues. It’s funny, real, and totally validating. Covers everything from diagnosis to daily coping tools. This is the best ADHD explainer you can hand to your partner, parent, or even your boss if they ""don't believe in ADHD."" Insanely good read.

- **Book: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear**  
  Yeah, it's a habit book. But it’s also a blueprint for ADHD brains to design environments that *automate* success. #1 New York Times bestseller, 10+ million copies sold, and especially helpful for people who struggle with motivation. It turns ""boring consistency"" into something actually interesting. This book will make you rethink how habits *actually* stick.

- **Podcast: *ADHD Experts Podcast* by ADDitude Magazine**  
  Essential listening if you want the latest science broken down for real humans. Each episode brings on psychologists, researchers, and real people to talk about emotions, executive function, parenting, adult ADHD, and underdiagnosis. Great mix of empathy and expertise. Their episodes on rejection sensitivity and ADHD burnout hit *hard*.

- **YouTube: How to ADHD (by Jessica McCabe)**  
  Think: ADHD crash course meets emotional support in video form. Jessica is charismatic, deeply researched, and totally authentic. Great starting point for teens or adults who are newly diagnosed, or long undiagnosed and finally making peace with their brain.

- **App: Insight Timer**  
  ADHD brains resist stillness, but this app makes it doable. Thousands of free guided meditations, calming music, breathing timers, and sleep stories. Unlike some wellness apps, it doesn’t try to push a “grind harder” agenda. I use it to wind down before bed and to reset when I feel chaos creeping in. Helps with ADHD sleep issues too.

- **App: BeFreed**  
  This one surprised me. It’s a personalized audio learning platform where you talk to an avatar (Freedia) and it crafts custom podcasts based on what you're struggling with, like “why I feel emotionally numb after working too long” or “how to stop chasing dopamine all day.” Built by a team from Columbia, Pinterest, and Google, it pulls insights from high-quality sources (books, papers, interviews) and turns them into super digestible audio lessons. You can even customize Freedia’s voice, I made mine sarcastic and smoky, which weirdly makes the tips stick better. It journals for me, creates flashcards, and holds me accountable. I’ve been using it instead of doom-scrolling before bed, and my brain actually feels less fried.

If there’s one mindset shift that makes ADHD easier to manage, it’s realizing that *you’re not broken*. Your brain is just wired for a different kind of learning and stimulation. Once you train your inputs to feed good dopamine and not just junk hits, focus stops feeling like punishment.

ADHD isn’t a lack of focus, it’s a focus regulation problem. But with the right systems and story about yourself, you can totally outsmart it.",1,1763790801.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False
1p3lndo,https://i.redd.it/kelc1nvjzq2g1.jpeg,Nanami Kento — 'Salary Worker'.,"Nanami, which I'll be referring to as ''Salary Worker' for consistency sake is a weapon-wielder type character, similar to Yuta, that specializes in its Special (R) to make the most out of its movesets.
Salary Worker would wield a Butcher Knife as its main tool, and can switch it out with any other tools equipabble. ( Although this doesn't change anything aside from the appearance, or unless the tool has a special property )

Salary Worker's R special allows him to create a 'Ratio Stitch' on an object they've targeted. Whether it be an object they're facing or currently have their mouse hovered over. 
The 'Ratio' lasts for a good 6-seconds, which disappears if the user hasn't interacted with it in that short time frame. Salary Worker players can tell an object is 'marked' with a ratio thanks to a red stitch marks that appears on a marked object.

Attacking the marked target would do a block-break, or deal a high amount of damage.
Another thing to note is that base Salary Worker would have low damage output unlike other characters — dealing a measley 5 damage on each hits. 
If the user marked a destructible object instead, the blocks would break instantly rather than requiring the minimal 4 hits. 
This Special has a cool-down limit of 12 seconds, and uses 5% of the ULT bar. Only up to 3 targets can be marked at once. If more has been marked, the first of the previously marked would be replaced by the new one.

*MOVESETS*:
1. Blunt Cut -
Salary Worker prepares themselves for a moment before lunging forward with a strong, back-of-the-blade slice towards the enemy. It deals very little damage, akin to a full-M1 combo for characters like Yuji, but where it excels is when it is paired with Salary Worker's Special.
Facing or targeting an enemy/object that has been marked with the 'Ratio Stitch' would increase the damage output significantly, alongside reduce the time-frame taken upon start-up.
Salary Worker user can also mark an opponent mid-way through the attack's animation by pressing R at any point in time before the slice lands, which deals the same high-damage but doesn't reduce the time-frame taken.

2. Wrist Breaker -
Salary Worker spins, and a flash of Ratio Stitch appears on the target's hand. If hit, it deals a decent amount of damage and also breaks block witout requiring the R special.
HOWEVER — if the target is marked by a Ratio Stitch BEFORE the attack is initiated, then it would temporarily disable the block of the target and also inflicts a split-second bleed damage onto them. The attack would still deal the same amount of damage regardless if the target is marked, and the special Variant can only be triggered if the target is marked beforehand, not during the attack.

3. Rush Forward -
Salary Worker sprints and does a high-damaging slice. If timed correctly, a Black Flash can occur which knocks the enemy back. 
If the target is marked beforehand, same condition as 'Wrist Breaker' — the Black Flash cannot be initiated and the attack would only deal decent amount of damage, slightly higher than 'Blunt Cut'. However, if this variant is utilized, then the enemy would be stunned for a second, allowing a combo-extension for the player.

4. Cursed Energy Shield -
Salary Worker has a faint blue glow on their chest. This move is a counter, which if triggered, reduces the damage taken from the attack and also temporarily stuns the enemy with the same time-frame as Manji Kick's animation. Salary Worker players can combo-extend, punish or start-combo with the stun provided. However, stunned players can exit out of their stunned state by using their ragdoll cancels.

With that — we can finally stop talking about the base movesets and move on over to the awakening.

Name — ""Overtime""

Passive — Salary Worker's Special, 'Ratio Stitch' no longer requires the ULT bar to be used and the cooldown is reduced from 12 to 9 seconds long.

Animation Concept — Salary Worker covers their in a cloth/tie, whilst saying:
""I'm going into...""
""Overtime now.""

1. Collapse Technique -
A bit of a strategical move that utilizes the destruction physics of the game to be effectively used. Salary Worker can aim anywhere they wish to initiate the technique, where they slam their hand onto a surface, whether it be the ceiling or walls to instantly destroy them. The destroyed walls are then imbued with Cursed Energy, which damages anyone who got hit while it is collapsing. Similar to a throwable objects. 
Salary Worker can jump and dash forwards during the move's start-up, allowing for easier reach to a surface like ceilings.
If Salary Worker uses Collapse Technique on a surface they've marked — the destruction is bigger and deals more damage.

2. Strong Fist -
Salary Worker does a clean, high-damaging hit to the target, similar to Todo's 'Brute Force' with faster start-up. However, if paired with the Special ( same condition as 'Wrist Breaker' and 'Rush Forward' ) — the start-up animation is removed, dealing a decent-damaging, yet high-knockback attack.

3. Rushdown -
Salary Worker sprints — attacking continuously at targets, similar to Hakari's 'Overwhelming Luck'. Each attack is swift and fast, with Salary Worker gradually getting faster as the move progresses until it ends.
If Salary Worker players attacks an already marked target. A Black Flash would occur, which shortens the duration of the skill but deals a high-damage to the target. Only 4 black flash can be initiated before the skill forcibly ends, and Salary Worker can mark enemies whilst using the move. ( same conditions as 'Blunt Cut' ).

4. Blunt Force -
A bit of a complicated move, and I wouldn't be surprised if people don't agree with me here.
Blunt Force, when used, removes the damage-ouput from your first M1 and third M1, only allowing the second and fourth M1 to deal 6. Additionally, the enemy hit with the fourth M1 would not get ragdolled ( similar to Naoya's 'Projection Sorcery' Special' ). Also, attacks from the first, third and fourth stuns the enemy for a split-second, disabling even the ragdoll cancel on the third and fourth M1.
The idea of this move is to sort of be a strategical, combo-starter with a slight downsides. You can obviously start a combo at any point you'd like but you can instead choose to stall until the fourth M1 to deal slight damage better than your regular M1's and start a combo from there.
Very, very complicated. 
The other alternative that is easier to use is 'Responsibility' — Salary Worker hits the target with their blunt butcher knife, stunning them before another character spawns in and hits the target with Divergent Fist, dealing decent damage. Kind of like Todo's 'Brother' skill.


Special Interactions / Finishers and other stuff that could be fun to add.

1. Special Mahito Death Animation -
If Salary Worker is killed by Idle Transfiguration from a Perfection player, their animation is slightly delayed, with a small text box saying:
""Malaysia...""
""Kuantan.....""
Appearing before their body, from the waist-up explodes rather than only the head.

2. Salary Worker would have Soda Can renamed to Coffee Can. It functions the same as a regular Soda Can.

3. Finishers —
Blunt Cut : The target's arms and legs would stand still for a moment before their arms and legs begin to bleed, which after a moment, would fall off.

Wrist Breaker : The target would try to block, but their wrist would be cut and flail around as they stand there in confusion before Salary Worker cuts their head clean-off.

Rush Forward : A simple, guaranteed Black Flash.

Strong Fist: Places both the player and the target in an animation. Salary Worker would do a fast punch to the target, which sends them flying, although closer than usual. Then, Salary Worker would grab the target by the hair and yanking them out to the air, before doing a dramatic final punch which flashes a Ratio Stitch in a black background for the target's screen as they get sent crashing through buildings.

Rushdown : An automatic, simple guaranteed Black Flash.

Achievements —
4. Adults of Adults - Win a Dual Match Whilst Having One Life on Your Party.
2. Caffeinated - Drink 30 Soda ( Coffee ) Can In One Life.
3. Malaysia... - Get Transfigured From Perfection Users While Under 30% Of Health.
4. Overtime - Use Overtime In a Casual Match Whilst Having 'Revealing One's Hand' Equipped.
5. Ratio — Defeat a Player With More Kills Than You.

1p3llca,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1p3llca/i_wasted_4_months_building_something_nobody/,I wasted 4 months building something nobody wanted. Here's how I finally learned to validate ideas before coding.,"Last year I built three different SaaS products that completely flopped.

Not small failures. Complete zero revenue, zero traction, total disasters.

The worst part? I saw the warning signs every time but ignored them because I was in love with my solutions.

# The Breaking Point

Project number three was a project management tool for remote teams. I spent 4 months building it. Beautiful UI. Clean code. All the features I thought teams needed.

Launched on Product Hunt. Ranked 38. Got 47 signups. 3 came back the next day. Zero conversions.

Sitting there at 2am looking at my analytics dashboard, I realized I never actually talked to a single remote team before building this thing. I just assumed I knew what they wanted.

That night I decided to completely flip my approach. No more building first. Validation first, always.

# What I Learned The Hard Way

The advice everyone gives is ""talk to customers"" but nobody tells you HOW to find them or WHAT to ask when you have no product yet.

Here's what actually worked for me:

## Step 1: Find where people complain

I started spending hours on Reddit reading communities where my target users hang out. Not to promote anything. Just to listen.

I looked for patterns in complaints. The same frustrations showing up across multiple posts. Real pain points that people were actively trying to solve.

For example, in communities like r/Entrepreneur and r/SaaS, I kept seeing founders talk about wasting months building products nobody wanted. The pain was real and specific.

## Step 2: Map the problem, not the solution

I created a simple spreadsheet. Three columns:

Problem people mentioned, how many times I saw it, exact phrases they used

The exact phrases part was critical. When someone says ""I hate how long it takes to validate if my SaaS idea has demand"" that's gold. That's the language real people use, not marketing speak.

I collected about 200 of these over two weeks. Patterns emerged fast.

## Step 3: Test demand before building anything

This is where most people skip ahead to coding. Don't.

I wrote a simple landing page describing the problem and the outcome, not features. Used the exact language from my research.

Added a waitlist form. Spent 50 dollars on Reddit ads targeting specific subreddits where I found the complaints.

If I couldn't get 100 email signups for 50 dollars, the idea was dead. Simple test.

## Step 4: Talk to the people who signed up

This changed everything for me. I emailed everyone who joined the waitlist and offered to buy them coffee on Zoom to understand their workflow.

10 people said yes. Those 10 conversations taught me more than 4 months of building in isolation ever did.

They told me exactly what they were currently doing to solve the problem. Where existing solutions failed. What they'd actually pay for.

# The Results

My next project took a completely different path.

I spent 3 weeks validating before I wrote a single line of code. By the time I started building, I had:

127 people on a waitlist who actually replied to my emails

Transcripts from 15 customer interviews

A clear understanding of what to build first and what to skip

I launched an MVP in 6 weeks. Basic as hell. But it solved the exact problem people told me they had.

First month: 23 paying customers at 29 dollars per month. That's 667 dollars MRR.

Not life changing money. But proof that validation actually works.

Now at 160 plus paying customers because I keep doing the same research process. Every feature decision starts with listening to what people actually want, not what I think they need.

# The Uncomfortable Truth

Most founders fail not because they can't code or because their product sucks. They fail because they build solutions to problems that don't exist or that nobody cares enough about to pay for.

The hardest part isn't the validation process. It's accepting that your brilliant idea might be wrong and being willing to kill it before you waste months building.

# What Actually Matters

You don't need a huge budget for validation. You need time and discipline.

Spend 2 weeks reading where your target users complain. Document everything. Look for patterns.

Test demand with a simple landing page before building anything. If you can't get 100 emails for 50 dollars, rethink the idea.

Talk to real people. Get on calls. Listen more than you talk.

Build the smallest possible version that solves the core problem. Not the version with all the features you think are cool.

# The Tool I Use Now

After going through this painful learning process, I got tired of manually searching through Reddit for hours. I built a research platform that monitors communities and analyzes discussions to find pain points and validate demand.

It basically automates what I was doing manually, scanning thousands of posts across subreddits and app store reviews to spot real problems people are trying to solve.

If you want to check it out, it's at [SaaSMilli](https://bigideasdb.com). Not necessary though. You can do all of this manually if you have the time. I just got lazy.

# The Main Point

Stop building in isolation. Stop assuming you know what people want.

Find where your target users already are. Listen to what they're actually struggling with. Validate demand before you write code.

Your next idea will probably be wrong too. But if you validate first, you'll find out in 2 weeks instead of 4 months.

That's the difference between failing fast and cheap versus failing slow and expensive.

What's the biggest validation mistake you've made? Would love to hear your stories.",5,1763790581.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False
1p3ll4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1p3ll4u/the_window/,The Window,"I used to live in this old house that was built around 1950. This house was pretty boring, no extravagant designs or fun colors, just a normal light blue two bedroom house. The only thing though was this huge window in the living room. With how my room was set up, the window saw right into where my head was on my bed and to make it worse the door to my room never stayed closed. This all culminated together one night when I jolted awake facing the giant window, I could vaguely make out a small pair of white dots on the right side. I sat up to get a better look at the dots but as soon as I did the dots disappeared, my heart was racing, I checked my phone… 4:30… dead of the night. I couldn’t go to sleep that night, playing games to pass the time. I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was still staring at me. Eventually my mom woke up and was getting ready for work. “Why are you awake, you didn’t stay up all night did you?” my moms voice was calming, finally the feeling dissipated. “No, I just woke up early… that’s all.” My voice was slightly shaky, I wanted to explain why I was awake but thinking about it, it did sound a bit stupid. “Ok well don’t be too loud, your dad’s still sleeping.” she said. “Y-yeah ok” she turned around and I could hear her starting to make coffee, thinking that was a pretty good idea, I slowly made my way to the kitchen making sure to avoid the creaky floor boards.



I ended up passing out in my chair only waking up later in the afternoon. My family was often out during the day and only really interacted at night seeing as we’re all night people, this never bothered me though, I usually did my own thing anyway. That night I didn’t see the dots but I could still feel them, I couldn’t sleep. It felt like something was hunting me, like no matter how much I hid… it could still see me. Later that same night I saw them again but this time I could see what looked like a person's head some sparse black hair “What the fuck” It didn’t move or react this time, it’s eyes felt like hot burning metal on my skin and my stomach was knotted. I ducked behind a wall… then there was a creek. I could hear a faint shaky breath and there was a feeling like it was beckoning me to go out there. A light turned on and I could hear my dad walking down the stairs, he must’ve been going to the bathroom. I looked out and the thing was gone, “Where did it go?” I asked myself, in that same instant a hand clamped on my shoulder and I sat up in my bed, I was breathing heavily and in a cold sweat. I turned my head to look out my room, the thing wasn’t there but… the light was on. “Jesus I must be going nuts” I said in a whisper tone. As I fell back asleep I hoped that the whole thing was just a dream, I hadn’t had much rest but somehow I managed to get through the day. I felt the thing a few times during the day but I tried my best to just ignore it. 



A few days later I was out in my backyard when I saw the eyes again, but this time they were in the window of the abandoned house across the fence. That creepy ass house was filled with papers and books. There were never any lights on and the car outside was overgrown with vines and blackberries, no one ever entered and nobody left, that I could see. The eyes seemed to follow me this time, like a wolf watching its prey. “Hey son! Can you come into the garage please!” My dad called out. As I made my way to my dad I could feel cold breath on my neck, I whipped my head around but there was nothing there, “It was probably just the wind” I wasn’t so sure if I could believe that but I didn’t want to face the idea that I was being stalked by a shadow creature. “Dad… do you know anything about the house across the way?” It took him a second to respond, “Not much really, I know that the three houses used to be a plantation.” This didn’t surprise me but it did make me feel a little ill at the thought of living on plantation land. 



I was inside a little while later washing my hands when I saw a man out of the corner of my eye. I let out a scream before seeing nothing there, I looked around a little… surely if this was real it would’ve left something, and yet there was nothing. I was brushing my teeth when the power shut off, I went to open the door but it was locked. “Hey mom, can you unlock the door?” I yelled, but I didn’t hear a response. Heavy breathing started behind me, I spun around and the eyes were right in my face, its breath smelled like dead animals and rotting paper. “Get the fuck awa-” My breath was taken away as I felt my flesh on my chest tear and rip. I screamed at the top of my lungs and tried to squirm and fight but it grabbed my hand and my throat, I felt the bones in my hand snap and shatter. I heard something bashing on the door but I was passed out before I could witness or feel anything more. I awoke in a hospital, the bright lights burned my eyes and my body didn’t have any feeling. “He’s awake!” I looked to see a nurse leaving the room. I turned my head to the right and saw my mom and dad coming towards me, crying and hugging me, but I couldn’t feel that either. “Why can’t I move?” As the words left my mouth I felt my vocal chords strain at the movement of air. “Whatever happened to you in the bathroom,” my mom stifled a sob “It broke your spine and… shattered your hand” her voice was less soothing than it used to, learning of my condition soured anything else I heard after that. We’ve moved houses since then. I haven't been able to move anything other than my head and they had to cut off my arm at the elbow. It sucks to not be able to do what I used to do, and even worse… I’ve started to see the eyes again…

I tried not to think too deep into it and brushed it off as she said she just liked toying with them and making them “uncomfortable.” We hung out again a few days later and she met me at a salon while I was getting my hair cut and was literally dancing in the window for men across the street and talking about them with my hair dresser. I was extremely nervous to leave the salon as I didn’t want to be approached by men I didn’t know because my friend was essentially making advances. The thing is, she’s the furthest from confrontational- constantly talks about how she hates crowds and loud noises and talking to random people and people staring at her which is why she’ll mess with men, to “give them something to look at.” That night she ended up staying at my apartment but before that, we took public transport and she got harassed by an old man to the point I had to ask what his problem was and belittled him until he left her alone. I’m extremely non-confrontational and will completely ignore every glance, comment or whatever it may be so I was slightly annoyed to have to do this, but obviously made no fuss because I wanted to keep her safe. I showed her around the town Im living in for a bit and she was noticeably socially exhausted so we just went to my place and relaxed the rest of the night. I hung out with her a few days ago and we just went to a cafe and went shopping but she kept talking about how much she likes messing with men because she “doesn’t see them as people” and has never had any genuine relationships with a man other than her father and how the attention she’ll get from an older man “makes her feel more confident and assured of herself”. She was waving at guys in their cars again, pointing at the ones who slowed down to stare, blowing kisses to guys across the street, sticking her tongue out at guys we passed or the ones who made glances from restaurants/shops. Honestly her whole demeanor towards men just makes me very anxious as I’ve had some very unpleasant experiences and have dealt with a few stalkers from a young age, (my mothers ex’s weren’t the most stable people). A day or so after we hung out, I had just been working all day and was utterly exhausted to the point I fell asleep at 8pm, she sent a text to a group chat with another girl we work with saying “i think i have two stalkers” around 10pm. I had woken up around 1:30 to use the bathroom and get water when I saw the message and couldn’t fall back asleep for nearly 5 hours. I ended up sending her a message saying she could always talk to me and I’d do what she needed to feel safe but also let her know that the safest option would probably be to not “provoke” random guys she catches looking at her as many guys have negative intentions and thoughts and may see what she deems as “jokes” as something more. I feel like such a dick for essentially blaming the victim, but I’m also concerned for my safety because she does this while we’re walking together in a country I’m not entirely familiar with while being far away from people I know can keep me safe and will actually get shit done if something were to happen. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or if I said the wrong thing- she seemed to have taken it well but I’m still frazzled by the whole situation as it brought up a lot of old emotions and fear that I thought I had moved on from. I’m honestly contemplating cutting ties with her but I’m not entirely sure because she really is a great person, I just hate being so concerned about my safety over something I might be blowing out of proportion.

The noodles don't get soft enough and the flavor isn't that great and the time that you have to wait for it to ""cook"" isn't even worth it.

I don't really like cherry Jolly Ranchers either. Watermelon and grape are definitely worse, but cherry is the middle child at best. It's fine, I just prefer blue raspberry or green apple.

So why is it then, that if I am given the choice between blue raspberry or cherry, I'll pick cherry?

Why, when I could have a sandwich, do I choose cup noodles for lunch?

It's like the mediocrity of these things is somehow comforting. It allows me to travel back to a more comforting, mediocre time.

With cup noodles and cherry Jolly Ranchers as my only sustenance, I would go about my mediocre day. I would wake up in my mediocre bed, put on my mediocre clothes, walk to school in my mediocre shoes, buy an overpriced mediocre coffee on the way, show up to my mediocre school with my mediocre friends, and I would have a perfectly mediocre day.

But I don't sleep in my old bed anymore. I don't even know where it is.

I have better, cleaner clothes. I don't have to walk anywhere anymore.

I have a coffee shop that I frequent that makes much better coffee.

I'm out of school and I have true friends.

I am happy.

So why, with all these things now in my life, do I miss the mediocrity?

Why do I stick cherry Jolly Ranchers between my teeth at work hoping to hear the chatter of kids in the hallway between classes? Why do I choose cup noodles for lunch in the hopes of feeling the heat of the stage lights on my skin? Why do I turn on show tunes in my car so I can hear the voices of old friends singing along? Why does my heart ache when I smell a soap that smells like the one my mediocre high school best friend used to use?

And why do I buy it just to never use it? Why do I still have it?

Why do I keep mediocre sweatshirts that don't even fit me just because someone I'm not even friends with anymore gave it to me? Why do I hide it in the back of my closet so that I don't have to look at it, but still won't throw it away?

What do I have to gain by holding onto these memories? Why do I feel desperate when I realize that they are fading away?

Why does the cotton mouth I get from nostalgia somehow sting?

It's not like I would trade the life I have in order to get these things back, but I wish I could for just one day.

For one more day, I would like to wake up in my childhood bed to SMASH playing on the TV. I want to put my theatre shirt on one more time, paired with the high tops that I gave away. I want to walk to school, breathing in the cool morning air and smell the fall rolling in as I start my day. I want to make myself late by stopping for a blended sugary coffee and a slice of bread. I want to walk into the cafeteria entrance and scan the room for my friends one last time. I want to feel the excitement I would have once I had spotted them. I want to sit there with so many of my friends that some of us had to stand because there weren't enough seats. I want to go to class and get a cherry Jolly Rancher as a reward. I want to hear the bell that marks the end of the day. I want to meet my best friend outside the door so that we can walk to the theatre together. I want to rehearse for hours with sore feet and a rumbling stomach. I want to heat up cup noodles in the teachers lounge on our break and eat it on stage with the cast. I want to be driven home in my friends car listening to show tunes, screaming until our lungs couldn't take it anymore. I want to tell her I love her as I exit the car, and hear her say that she loves me too. I want to watch movies and paint mediocre paintings until it's time to go to sleep.

And lastly, I want to close my eyes without the knowledge that, someday, all of these things will be gone. And that the things that stay will change.

I never asked for an end to the mediocrity. It just ended. Without even batting an eye, I unknowingly went to my best friends house for the last time. I went on my last car ride with my friends. I had my last theatre show. I sucked on my last cherry Jolly Rancher in the hallway and ate my last cup of noodles in the dressing room. I told my best friend I loved her for the last time. I called her my best friend for the last time. 

But the thing is, these things never left me.

I still eat cup noodles, and cherry Jolly Ranchers, and listen to show tunes. 

I still park my car in the theatre parking lot with my overpriced sugary coffee and my bread.

Part of me still lives there. And I know that she always will.",1,1763790269.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False
1p3lhxn,https://i.redd.it/wphjkwrzxq2g1.jpeg,I was 75 kgs then I was 120 kgs and now 94 kgs,"I was a skinny boy at 75 kgs 2 years ago before I thought of going on a dirty bulk while lifting weights….at the time my thought behind that was “Abhi I’ll gain muscles and fat and later and cut the fat” 
Over a period of 1.2 years I went from 75 kgs to 120 kgs….i was in a very bad shape because in that period, I stopped working out, but didn’t leave the junk food. 

I did manage to gain a lot of muscle mass, but more than the muscle mass, it was the fat mass that I gained. 

Starting this year in Feb I was 118 kgs and I decided to change my habits 

I started working out and clean eating both at the same time, but couldn’t sustain both. 

So I started with eating clean….i introduced 24 hour water fasts into my routine once or twice a week (had sugar free sports electrolytes, black coffee and creatine on those days) 

And on the days I ate, I ate clean, high protein, healthy fats and complex carb meals along with multi vitamins, because being on a calorie strict diet…you end up getting deficient in a lot of vitamins and minerals, especially for a person at my height and body weight 

In September, just based on healthy eating and time to time water fasts, or OMAD, I reached from 118 kgs to 98 kgs…

I started working out a month back along with the clean diet and my body composition is getting a lot better now. 

A month back I was 98-99 kgs and now I’m sitting it 93-95 kgs

My goal is to bring it down to 85 kgs first, and then from there, I’d work on increasing my lean muscle mass and keep my fat % at around 15-20%

1p3lggu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p3lggu/the_window/,The Window,"I used to live in this old house that was built around 1950. This house was pretty boring, no extravagant designs or fun colors, just a normal light blue two bedroom house. The only thing though was this huge window in the living room. With how my room was set up, the window saw right into where my head was on my bed and to make it worse the door to my room never stayed closed. This all culminated together one night when I jolted awake facing the giant window, I could vaguely make out a small pair of white dots on the right side. I sat up to get a better look at the dots but as soon as I did the dots disappeared, my heart was racing, I checked my phone… 4:30… dead of the night. I couldn’t go to sleep that night, playing games to pass the time. I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was still staring at me. Eventually my mom woke up and was getting ready for work. “Why are you awake, you didn’t stay up all night did you?” my moms voice was calming, finally the feeling dissipated. “No, I just woke up early… that’s all.” My voice was slightly shaky, I wanted to explain why I was awake but thinking about it, it did sound a bit stupid. “Ok well don’t be too loud, your dad’s still sleeping.” she said. “Y-yeah ok” she turned around and I could hear her starting to make coffee, thinking that was a pretty good idea, I slowly made my way to the kitchen making sure to avoid the creaky floor boards.



I ended up passing out in my chair only waking up later in the afternoon. My family was often out during the day and only really interacted at night seeing as we’re all night people, this never bothered me though, I usually did my own thing anyway. That night I didn’t see the dots but I could still feel them, I couldn’t sleep. It felt like something was hunting me, like no matter how much I hid… it could still see me. Later that same night I saw them again but this time I could see what looked like a person's head some sparse black hair “What the fuck” It didn’t move or react this time, it’s eyes felt like hot burning metal on my skin and my stomach was knotted. I ducked behind a wall… then there was a creek. I could hear a faint shaky breath and there was a feeling like it was beckoning me to go out there. A light turned on and I could hear my dad walking down the stairs, he must’ve been going to the bathroom. I looked out and the thing was gone, “Where did it go?” I asked myself, in that same instant a hand clamped on my shoulder and I sat up in my bed, I was breathing heavily and in a cold sweat. I turned my head to look out my room, the thing wasn’t there but… the light was on. “Jesus I must be going nuts” I said in a whisper tone. As I fell back asleep I hoped that the whole thing was just a dream, I hadn’t had much rest but somehow I managed to get through the day. I felt the thing a few times during the day but I tried my best to just ignore it. 



A few days later I was out in my backyard when I saw the eyes again, but this time they were in the window of the abandoned house across the fence. That creepy ass house was filled with papers and books. There were never any lights on and the car outside was overgrown with vines and blackberries, no one ever entered and nobody left, that I could see. The eyes seemed to follow me this time, like a wolf watching its prey. “Hey son! Can you come into the garage please!” My dad called out. As I made my way to my dad I could feel cold breath on my neck, I whipped my head around but there was nothing there, “It was probably just the wind” I wasn’t so sure if I could believe that but I didn’t want to face the idea that I was being stalked by a shadow creature. “Dad… do you know anything about the house across the way?” It took him a second to respond, “Not much really, I know that the three houses used to be a plantation.” This didn’t surprise me but it did make me feel a little ill at the thought of living on plantation land. 



I was inside a little while later washing my hands when I saw a man out of the corner of my eye. I let out a scream before seeing nothing there, I looked around a little… surely if this was real it would’ve left something, and yet there was nothing. I was brushing my teeth when the power shut off, I went to open the door but it was locked. “Hey mom, can you unlock the door?” I yelled, but I didn’t hear a response. Heavy breathing started behind me, I spun around and the eyes were right in my face, its breath smelled like dead animals and rotting paper. “Get the fuck awa-” My breath was taken away as I felt my flesh on my chest tear and rip. I screamed at the top of my lungs and tried to squirm and fight but it grabbed my hand and my throat, I felt the bones in my hand snap and shatter. I heard something bashing on the door but I was passed out before I could witness or feel anything more. I awoke in a hospital, the bright lights burned my eyes and my body didn’t have any feeling. “He’s awake!” I looked to see a nurse leaving the room. I turned my head to the right and saw my mom and dad coming towards me, crying and hugging me, but I couldn’t feel that either. “Why can’t I move?” As the words left my mouth I felt my vocal chords strain at the movement of air. “Whatever happened to you in the bathroom,” my mom stifled a sob “It broke your spine and… shattered your hand” her voice was less soothing than it used to, learning of my condition soured anything else I heard after that. We’ve moved houses since then. I haven't been able to move anything other than my head and they had to cut off my arm at the elbow. It sucks to not be able to do what I used to do, and even worse… I’ve started to see the eyes again…

In the near future, I'm planning to go on holiday✈️ so I would love to have some recommendations for travel destinations. At the moment, I have Oman🇴🇲, Slovenia🇸🇮 and Portugal🇵🇹 on my list.

At the moment, I’m open to long distance if the energy feels right, but I’d love for it to eventually lead to something in person. This could be coffee dates, museum days, getting food together, or just wandering around the city.

1p3lg0r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3lg0r,popular snacks in Jeju Island.,"A Snack to Eat in Jeju Island Jeju Island preserves its own island culture. Local snacks that can only be tasted in Jeju are always popular with tourists, and queuing is a must. I recommend popular snacks in Jeju Island. 


1. Golden Pork Bread: Sweet Temptations for Blessing

The hottest item at the souvenir shop near Jeju Airport is the golden pig bread. The product, which is sprinkled with golden sugar on top of a pig-shaped bread filled with red bean paste from Jeju, is especially popular as a New Year's or holiday gift. Local merchants say that the bread symbolizes blessings and prosperity, and locals also buy it in bulk. Recently, online sales have also begun, attracting a flood of orders from all over the country.


2. Citrus taffy: Jeju's winter symbol, refreshing sweetness  

Citrus taffy using citrus fruits, Jeju's representative fruit, is being refocused as a traditional snack. It boasts a unique flavor as citrus juice permeates into the chewy taffy. The product, which is sold only at Jeju's local food ""Some Jeju"" in Seogwipo's Maeil Ole Market, has become an essential purchase item for foreign tourists by adding luxury to its glass bottle packaging.


3. Milkwehas: a mouthful of the freshness of a clean ranch.  

Milkwehas, produced at Jeju Natural Ranch in Hallim-eup, Jeju City, is a snack that contains cream made from milk directly salty at a local ranch. The combination of crispy wehas and rich milk scent makes it popular not only for children's snacks but also for dessert enjoyed with coffee. The short shelf life leaves a regret that it can only be tasted locally.


4. Peanut Jjondeugi: Jeju-style snack that gets addicted to savory taste.

Peanut Jjondeugi, which is sold at Seongsan Peanut Shop near Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak, is a chewy snack made by ground roasted peanuts from Jeju Island. It is not sweet and savory, and is loved by locals as it is easy to eat during hiking or driving. More than 300 are sold on average a day. 


5. Jeju fermented foods: Omegi liquor, tangerine makgeolli, and black pork sausage. 

If you're a traditional liquor lover, don't miss ome technology, citrus rice wine, and black pork sausages. Omegisul is a rice wine made of Jeju rice and yeast and is characterized by a subtle grain scent. unrefined tangerine rice wine is popular with young people with its refreshing juices, and black pork sausage is attractive with the rich juices of Jeju pork. These products are available at Hanaro Mart and Jeju Local Food, Sumjeju.


6. Dolharbang Macaron: Meet Jeju's Icon for Dessert.

Dolharbang Macaron, which is sold at Dolharbang, a cafe in Jungmun Tourist Complex, Seogwipo, is a dessert with the motif of Dolharbang, the representative symbol of Jeju. It contains filling made with Jeju specialties such as Hallabong, matcha, and black sesame, and is also famous for Instagram photos. It releases only a limited quantity at 10 a.m. every day and is sold out early.


7. Haenyeo Burger: Seogwipo's secret menu full of ocean scents.

The haenyeo burger, sold at the restaurant of the haenyeo's house near Gimnyeong Haenyeochon, is a handmade burger using abalone caught by Jeju haenyeo as a patty. The smell of the sea and savory cheese are harmonized, and you can experience the culture of haenyeo with taste. It is so popular that you have to wait for more than an hour on weekends.


Food is not just about eating, it is also a means of sharing Jeju's history and culture. In your trip, I hope you will leave special memories with local snacks with unique flavors of Jeju.",1,1763790076.0,KoreaSeoul,0,1.0,False

I always imagined freedom would feel *big,* like wide-open desert roads, waking up by the ocean, mountains out the windshield, all that cliché-but-true stuff.

But the freedom that surprised me most is actually, quiet.  
It’s the kind of freedom that sneaks up on you at 6:17 AM when you realize you don’t need an alarm anymore.  
It’s making coffee on a tiny stove while the rest of the world rushes somewhere you don’t have to be.  
It’s fixing a leaky seal with zip-ties and a questionable amount of optimism and realizing you’re more capable than you ever gave yourself credit for.

Yesterday I parked near a little river in a town I’d never heard of.  
An older couple walked by, asked about the van, and then invited me to share their campfire that evening. No phones. No small talk. Just fire, stories, and that weird sense of connection you only get when people have no reason to impress each other.

And that’s when it hit me:  
Vanlife isn’t about escaping society. It’s about re-learning how to be human in the simplest way possible.

Anyway, not every day is magical. Some days are flat tires, laundromats, and rain you swear is falling sideways. But even those days feel more *real* than the life I left behind.

1p3lc4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wednesday/comments/1p3lc4p/hydes_are_artists_by_nature/,"""Hydes are artists by nature""","I keep thinking about that Faulkner line that gets quoted in Wednesday: “Hydes are artists by nature.” It’s clearly meant to steer the audience toward Xavier at first, since he’s the one who actually paints and creates things on screen. But if the line is supposed to be true in the lore, then where are Tyler’s artistic abilities hiding?

We have not actually seen Tyler do anything that would count as artistic in a traditional sense. No drawing, no sculpting, no music, nothing like that. So either the line is only a red herring for Xavier, or Tyler’s creativity shows up in different, quieter ways. It could be in the way he handles coffee and makes drinks at the Weathervane, or even in the way he arranged and kept up the crypt where he and Wednesday watched a film. Maybe the Hyde expresses creativity through instinct, planning, or craft rather than fine art.

Honestly, I really want Season 3 to show what Tyler’s artistic side actually looks like. If Hydes really are naturally creative, then we should get to see what form that takes for him, especially now that he is more central to the story. There is a lot of potential for the show to give him a unique artistic outlet that fits both his personality and his darker nature.",2,1763789700.0,Wednesday,11,0.67,False

my requirements are just for me to find someone who had no past like me and even if they did, to have repented and to be practicing. i just feel so frustrated that all those years i spent trying to be on the right path just led to nothing.

and i know this is one of the waswasahs of the shaytaan to tempt you to act on the lower base desires but i just sometimes look at people who started dating, developed an understanding with a gf bf and marry that person seem more at ease and happier rather than people who just marry complete strangers and hope for the best.

and my requirements that the man should be the provider and on the deen and should be okay with me working just seem too much for narrow minded men these days. they forget that the woman is a complete whole person like them. who has her own goals interests and ambitions. koi gol roti aur ghar daari k khawab dekh kar itna zaleel nahi hota to get an education. mere yeyhi goals hotay i couldve gotten married at 18.

i am not against doing household chores. i just dont want that to be my entire identity. i would do the chores and work on my skills saath saath because i dont want to feel as if all i learnt got wasted.

why do men have a problem with providing and  wanting their girl work towards her goals? they think if she is working then she must contribute even tho Hazrat Khadija also ran her business and her money was her money. they all want a pious wife until it comes to the concept that your money is her money and her money is also her money. now this doesnt mean i wouldnt be willing to contribute if we were ever in a phase where the man was struggling financially.

is it so hard to find someone who would want mutual growth in all aspects? like someone who wants to work on their goals and i work on mine, while we split the chores read books and have coffee together and become eachother’s safe space against the world.

likin nahi. most men don’t even want something halal. they just want someone to sext with, lead on, and soon ghost when they realise the girl isn’t willing to give herself up and then call the ones who do cave in, hoes.

Hello, my name's Smith, I'm 28, I worked as a Policeman, I usually patrol the Station around Early in the Dawn and Midnight. Sure the Pay's good. My friend also Works there, We would be Talking together. James, James around 23, Much Younger than Me.   
  
We both work around the Same Time, But I Have to like, Watch the Station. There would be a Person walking by, I Shrug it off Since There's people walking pass by the Station on some City. But, Our town is Small. And Night times Means, People will not Come out. Well If you want to Buy, Walk, Etc.

I'm currently watching the Cameras, But Every time I looked away, The timer on the Monitor stopped. ""Okay...? That's wrong"" My thoughts said, But when I looked at the Clock. The Clock is still Ticking. I don't know what the Fuck is Happening but When I looked outside, The Same person from Before It's walking by. ""Alright, What the Fuck was That?""   
  
I went back to My Monitor but the Same god damn Person It's running Up to Me. I jumped back and When I looked at Outside... Nothing, I mean, NOTHING was fucking there! I fucking- My fucking Heart stopped! And when I looked at the Monitor. THE FUCKING PERSON WAS LOOKING AT THE CAMERA, STARING AT ME. DIRECTLY TO MY SOUL. HIS, OR HER, BREATHING WAS SHARP AND ALWAYS STOPPED.   
  
I shut down the Camera and Lock down the Station. I ran back to My Home like a Pussy. I couldn't blink on My sleep, Trying to Think what the Fuck was that. A few Days later. I walked by to the Station, My friend wasn't there. ""Huh"" I said under my Breath and Walked to the Guy who is In control of This Station. He said that James is 'Sick'. I shrugged it off and Walks to the Camera room to Watch over.

  
It was Around Midnight, I was drinking My Usual Coffee and Looking at Outside and The Cameras, Then. Something, Something snapped in My god damn Mind. The Same fucking Person was there, A Chill shiver Ran to my Skull. I checked the Camera and Nothing was there, I looked Back at the Street and Poof! Nothing, Nothing was There! ""I'm fucking Delusion, I'm fucking Delusion, I'm fucking Delusion."" My mind was Saying the same Sentence, Over and Over. I hit my Head and Blacked out.  
  
When I woke up, James and our Police Chief (Nina, Who I never Mention before) was Standing over Me. James helped me Get up and Tell me what Happen.   
  
(""Smith, What the Hell happen?"") -James  
  
(""I- I hit my Head, I think..."") -Smith

(""It's there Anything to Know?"") -Nina

(""I... I think I see a Person, Walking pass by. Every day..."") -Smith

I showed the Camera and Rewind it, Then, When I reached the Time where the Person Is looking at the Camera. There are now 2 people, Watching the Camera. Twitching and Tilting their Head. Nina and James were Shocked at this, They tell me to Get a 3 Day vacation, I reject It because I want to Know about this Damned Person

A Few days later, FBI Agents came in, Watching the Cameras. They tell me to Have Seat, They tell me what Happen. I said that Around a Few days ago, There's around just a Guy, Walking pass by. When I looked at the Camera, The Guy from Before, Is now Running up to Me and When I looked back, The Guy was still walking pass by.

They looked at Each other, They nod and Gave me a Card. They said that When I saw It, Call them, They also gave me a News Paper, Around Early 1980s. The News Paper said that A House was Exploded here, The Exact Spot where Our station would Be. The Family or, Robertson's, Have that Exact House. They said that The Incident would be a Gas leak. Well, 'WOULD BE' No one knows How the House Exploded. 

Three hours later, I got home eventually. I locked the door, Drank some Coffee, took a long shower, and slept for a day and a half. Nobody came to the Station in the night, and nobody came the next day, or the one after that. It was over.

1p3l5pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1p3l5pu/life_optimization_your_blueprint_for_max/,Life Optimization 💯: Your Blueprint for Max Productivity & Unstoppable Joy! 🚀💡,"Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever have one of those weeks where you're busy from sunup to sundown, but at the end of it, you feel like you didn't actually *move the needle* on anything important? You're just... tired. We've all been there. It's the classic hamster wheel of being busy, not productive.

But what if we stopped seeing our life as a series of random tasks and started seeing it as a project we get to design? That's what ""Life Optimization"" is really about. It's not about becoming a robot; it's about building a **personal blueprint** where your productivity actually fuels your happiness, instead of draining it.

**Productivity isn't just about doing more, it's about doing what matters.** Most of us already know how to make a to-do list. The real magic happens when you align that list with what you truly want.

A few things that have helped me shift my focus:

*   **Focus on Energy, Not Just Time:** Instead of just scheduling tasks, I schedule them according to my energy levels. Deep, creative work when I'm at my sharpest (for me, that's the morning). Admin and easy stuff for the afternoon slump.
*   **The ""One Thing"" Rule:** What's the **one thing** you could do today that would make everything else easier or unnecessary? Do that first. No exceptions. It's a game-changer for cutting through the noise.
*   **Celebrate the ""Done"" List:** At the end of the day, look back at what you *actually* accomplished instead of just staring at what's left. It rewires your brain to see progress, not just deficits.

**But here's the secret ingredient: Unstoppable Joy.**

You can have the most efficient schedule in the world, but if you're not building in moments of genuine joy, you're on a fast track to burnout. Joy isn't a reward for after the work is done; it's the fuel that makes the work possible.

This means being intentional:

*   **Schedule ""Play"":** Seriously. Put ""go for a walk with no destination"" or ""doodle for 30 minutes"" in your calendar. Protect that time like it's a meeting with your CEO. Because it is. You're the CEO of your life.
*   **Know Your Joy Triggers:** What makes you feel alive? Is it listening to a specific album? A 10-minute coffee break on the porch? A quick call with a friend? Identify these and sprinkle them throughout your day.

Of course, let's be real. Building this blueprint is tough. We hit walls. We fall back into old habits. Sometimes, the biggest block isn't the strategy; it's the emotional weight we're carrying—the self-doubt, the anxiety, the feeling of being stuck. If you feel like you're hitting that wall and need some help sorting through the mental clutter, I’ve personally found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be a massive help for building that inner strength and resilience.

This whole process is a journey, not a destination. Your blueprint will change and evolve, and that's the whole point.

So, I'm curious—what's one small thing you do to intentionally build joy into your productive days? What's working for you?",1,1763789089.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1p3l4ui,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3l4ui,ARF Root beer vs Gen,"The root beer has been one of my favorite watches for a long time. I got this ARF weighted rootbeer with a deep crystal mod from my TD a few weeks ago. Then I got the opportunity to buy the gen and decided to still go for it because of my infatuation with this watch. Thought I'd share the opportunity to highlight some differences since I have them side by side now.

1. Bezel -- This is the first thing that stands out. The gen has a deeper brown (cocoa or coffee vs. milk chocolate). The hour numerals are much more boldly printed, it makes it very easy to tell which one is the gen. Wish ARF could've gotten this a little closer.

2. Crystal - First off, the gen crystal is SO much clearer IRL, especially around the rim. I sprang for the deep crystal mod because of what I read about ARF stock crystal being subpar. I wish I didn't, I really don't think it was worth it. There is a milky ring around the rim (gasket?) that I can't unsee. I don't know if this has to do with how it was installed or a fault of deep crystal itself. I have two other ARF GMTs -- my Bruce Wayne also had deep crystal installed (by a different TD) and has the same issue. My Batgirl which just has the stock ARF crystal does not. The stock ARF crystal is weaker than gen, but at least it looks less milky by the rehaut. It's become obvious to me comparing all 3 side by side, but hopefully not that noticeable on the wrist. 

Also the cyclops has way too much mag, and you can see it in the photos clearly. 

3. Rose gold -- The ARF does a really valiant job. The hour markers, the hands, the bezel rim color are all almost identical to gen. But the two tone on the bracelet definitely is a different hue. This is hard to capture, but easiest to see on the clasp photo. The gen has this lighter, warm, pinkish hue. The rep is brighter and more orange. It's wild how much of a difference it makes to me on the wrist, the rep feels a little loud and garish compared to the gen. 

Summary:
Everything else I didn't mention is pretty much the same -- the weight, the black dial, the bracelet feel, the clasp. The rep really does a great job for a fraction of the price. In some ways I'm happy there are these noticeable differences, because it helps me justify buying the gen. I gravitate so much more to the colors and tones on the gen (deeper browns, bolder bezel, light rose gold), because thats why I originally fell in love with this watch. I'll be keeping the rep to wear regularly without worry of scratches / theft and save my gen to wear for the right occasions. 

Now to decide if I should spend any more $$ to plate the rep or just call it a day on this root beer obsession 🤣

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Lens vs. Strasbourg: A Clash of Ambition and Fatigue**  
*Where the Odds Favor Focus, but the Humor Favors Absurdity*

The Ligue 1 clash between **RC Lens** and **Strasbourg** on November 22, 2025, is shaping up to be a tactical chess match masquerading as a football game. With Lens (3rd, 25 points) and Strasbourg (4th, 22 points) both eyeing a leap into the top three, the stakes are as high as a striker’s hopes after a last-minute equalizer. Let’s dissect the odds, news, and absurdity to predict who’ll walk away with the spoils—and who’ll have to settle for a metaphorical participation trophy.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For

The betting markets are as clear as a post-match press conference after a 2-1 comeback. Lens is the favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **2.10** (implied probability: \~47.6%), while Strasbourg checks in at **3.40** (\~29.4%). The draw? A tidy **3.60** (\~27.8%). These numbers suggest Lens’s home advantage and stronger current form (they’ve won several recent matches) give them the edge, but Strasbourg’s price tag isn’t a cry for help—it’s more of a “we’re sleep-deprived but still dangerous” vibe.

The spread (-0.25 for Lens) and over/under (2.75 goals) hint at a low-scoring, tightly contested affair. If you’re betting on “Over,” you’re essentially banking on a fireworks show. If you’re betting “Under,” you’re probably a fan of tedium and spreadsheets.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Fatigue, and a Suspended Heist

**Lens** is missing suspended defender **Jonathan Gradit**, a man whose absence is like realizing your coffee is decaf at 3 a.m. Coach Pierre Sage is reshuffling the deck, but **Robin Risser** returns to bolster defense—a welcome sight for a backline that’s been leakier than a sieve in a monsoon. Lens’s recent form is solid, and their home record? Well, they’re playing in **Stade Bollaert-Delelis**, a fortress where the stands chant louder than the opposing team’s strikers.

**Strasbourg**, meanwhile, is injury-free b

I studied at Krupanidhi College, Bangalore from 2019 to 2022 — and honestly, those were the best years of my life.

Back then, everything just *clicked*. I had my Pulsar NS160, friends who were like family, and every day felt like a movie scene. I used to perform on stage and I still remember the whole auditorium shouting my name — “**R.a.k R.a.k**” — that sound still echoes in my head sometimes. That rush, that energy, that feeling of being *seen* — nothing has matched it since.

Now life’s quieter. Everyone’s busy. No random canteen plans, no last-minute fests, no bunking for rides or filter coffee. It’s just… adult life, da.  
Sometimes I scroll through old photos or videos and it hits me how alive I used to feel back then.

I guess I’m just missing *that version of me* — the confident, carefree, loud one who owned every moment.

Caught in a steel trap expertly laid by Labor, Liberals ceded a mantle, once deemed sacred, that went to the very core of its being.

The dramatic role reversal that night, as Anthony Albanese prepared to call the election, also killed whatever chance the opposition had of branding itself during the campaign as the superior economic managers and Labor as the party of high taxes and big spending.

The decision to oppose Labor’s $17 billion tax-cut package was made by Peter Dutton in the budget lock-up.

The plan to offer a tax cut had been kept secret for months, deemed “close hold” in the language of insiders, which meant it was not to be disclosed, discussed, or even whispered about, except between Albanese, Jim Chalmers, and Katy Gallagher, and a select few others including their chiefs of staff and a tight band of senior Treasury and Finance officials. The officials had even given the plan a code name – “Project Georgia” – so only they could access and identify the tax cut.

Albanese had no idea the boffins had come up with a code name. His code name, he later joked, was: “Give us a f------ tax cut. You know, I just wanted the tax cut.”

Albanese, Chalmers, and Gallagher began serious work on the new tax cuts before Christmas 2024, after the prime minister had discussed it with the party’s national secretary and campaign mastermind, Paul Erickson. Albanese was utterly determined to blindside the opposition.

“We needed something in the budget,” he told me afterwards. And it needed to be kept as tight as. There would be no hints to media or drops in advance, as there were with other major policies. “If it was dropped to the Sunday papers, by the time it got to Tuesday, it would have been ‘Five bucks, so what?’” he said. “As it was, it was bang. And it worked.”

The Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet, the so-called razor gang, was briefed at the last possible moment at a virtual meeting at 9am on Friday, March 21, only four days before it was unveiled. Even at the full cabinet meeting a few hours before he delivered his speech, Chalmers only dropped cryptic hints about other measures, without spelling out exactly what would be unveiled.

Albanese did not want to risk either a leak from cabinet or one careless word by ministers or members of their staff in a corridor or at a coffee cart that would even hint there was something else big in the budget. He wanted it kept so quiet that the first the opposition knew about it was in the budget lock-up. Who knows what might happen, Albanese said to his colleagues. It might force the Liberals to make a mistake.

It succeeded, as they would later admit, beyond their wildest dreams.

The opposition’s public decline and fall began in the round of post-budget interviews with the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, when he revealed their opposition to the tax cuts. Taylor and Dutton called them a hoax, an insult, because they were only $5 a week.

Before those public comments by Dutton and Taylor, Coalition MPs were already extremely anxious. A few Nationals had overheard Dutton telling Andrew Hastie in passing in the chamber after Chalmers’ budget speech that they were going to spend the $17 billion tax cuts on defence.

Next morning, Liberal and National MPs went to see David Littleproud to tell him he had to do something. Dutton and Littleproud met later that day to work up an alternative. That was how and when the fuel-tax rebate policy came about. It was a complete, utter shambles.

Until 8.30 on budget night, Labor had simply planned to take the modest cuts as a promise to the election that everyone knew would be announced within days. The Liberals had supported almost every measure Labor had announced since January: $7.2 billion for the Bruce Highway; the $7.9 billion Medicare package to boost bulk billing; another round of energy-bill relief of $150 for every household; and $644 million for 50 additional Medicare urgent-care clinics.

The extra billions were piling up. Dutton had little choice but to adopt whatever Labor announced on health in an effort to neutralise the damage. And the opposition had already committed to producing a healthier budget bottom line, to be more rigorous with savings and more prudent with spending.

It was all part of Albanese’s strategy, thinking ahead to, “Where are we going to end up, where are they going to go.”

“So how do we turn their roads into cul-de-sacs? That is what I say to people literally,” he told me later. No wonder his colleagues say he loves plotting.

Even so, Labor figured that even if the opposition struggled to make their sums add up, and derided the tax cuts as measly, they would still copy or adapt them. They thought they would go to the election saying, “If you vote for us, you will get a tax cut”; or, at the worst, they would have to defend their offer against whatever alternative the Liberals proposed.

If Taylor and the shadow finance minister, Senator Jane Hume, had their way, voters would have been forced to decide between duelling tax cuts. They had gone into the lock-up early, well before Dutton. When they saw the tax cut, they knew they would have to respond to it, so began working up options. The first was simply to accept what the government was offering. They were not enthusiastic about that.

Another was to oppose it outright. They didn’t think that was a good idea, either. The third was to oppose the government’s tax cut, but to make another offer – a tax-back guarantee. With this, something Taylor had previously worked up, if inflation went up higher than 3 per cent, pushing people into a higher tax bracket, the difference between the 3 per cent and the actual inflation rate would be returned as a cut to taxpayers. They argued the beauty of that was if inflation was contained within the Reserve Bank’s target range of between 2 and 3 per cent, there would be no additional outlays.

It seemed like a plan. Until Dutton walked into the lock-up later that afternoon.

Dutton instinctively was not interested in doing anything on tax. He did not think a bigger or different tax cut was the way to go. And he was not enthused – to put it mildly – by Taylor’s idea. Dutton told Taylor and Hume that the Coalition wasn’t going to try to outdo the government’s tax cut; they would oppose it and would offer to spend the money on defence instead. Hume and Taylor were shocked.

Littleproud came in at the tail end of their conversation. When they told him they were going to vote against the tax cut, he felt the blood drain from his face. He says he went white. They said he seemed apprehensive. It was an understatement. He told colleagues he was “f------ frightened”.

Littleproud warned Dutton that they had not made a case for that level of defence spending and that they needed to be doing something about the cost of living. He was astounded that Dutton was thinking of running a khaki election in the middle of a cost-of-living election. He thought that doing something about the lower-middle-income tax offset – anything to reduce tax – would be better.

Deputy leader Sussan Ley, who was also there, showed expertise in traversing both sides. She said that focusing on defence was compelling because it would provide more jobs for families in defence industries. Then she also agreed with Hume that the cost of living had been the number one issue for three years and was still the number one issue, so perhaps they should do something on tax.

With a line that should have clinched the argument in favour of a tax cut, but instead was met with steely stares, Hume reminded them: “Suburban mums don’t vote for submarines.”

Ultimately, they had no choice but to fall in behind Dutton. They did not feel, at that late stage of the game, that they could roll him. Some of them convinced themselves it was a piddling tax cut. It wasn’t real reform; it was a handout. They figured it wouldn’t cut through to the voters in the outer suburbs they were trying to win over.

Dutton said later that the conversation revolved around whether they should match the government’s tax cut or not. “The difficulty is you have a lot of me-tooism and not much money to me-do,” he told me. “We had already spent money on health and promised to oppose the tax on unrealised capital gains. We thought you could get a better bang for your buck doing something in childcare or fuel excise. Budget papers showed we were $1.2 trillion in debt. What sort of Liberal Party goes for tax cuts without offsets?”

He said no one in their right mind was suggesting cuts to the NDIS or defence, or health or education, and his alternative, the fuel excise, which was not baked in to recurrent spending, “rated its socks off”.

Dutton was also convinced that Taylor’s tax idea was impossible to sell. “Good thinking and all that,” he told people later. “But you couldn’t retail it. He could barely explain it to colleagues.”

Senator James Paterson, who was not in the lock-up, texted Dutton as soon as he heard he was planning to oppose the tax cuts, telling him that would be a mistake, warning: “Don’t do this.” Another frontbencher, Michael Sukkar, delivered a similar message.

Paterson was incredulous. In his view, the decision to vote against then promise to repeal the tax cut was the most consequential of the campaign, and probably the biggest mistake that Dutton made, and it was not even taken to the shadow ministry or the party room.

Labor’s critical players – Albanese, Chalmers, Gallagher, Erickson and Albanese’s chief of staff, Tim Gartrell – none of them, not for one moment, thought they would ever be saying: “If you vote Liberal, you will be voting for higher taxes.”

After hearing Taylor’s response, Albanese, Chalmers, and Gallagher texted one another to say that maybe they should legislate the cuts the next day. Chalmers thought the opposition might be “dumb enough” to vote against them.

The next morning when Dutton was interviewed by Sabra Lane on AM, he made clear his opposition to the tax cuts. He also made it obvious he would not match or exceed the government’s package and would, in fact, repeal it.

Fiona Sugden relayed the news to Albanese in between his early morning post-budget interviews. He immediately gave the go-ahead to introduce the legislation. The leader of the house, Tony Burke, cleared the way for the bills to be introduced into the House of Representatives at 9am.

The morning after the budget, before the vote in the chamber, the debacle deepened. For more than 12 hours, opposition MPs were kept completely in the dark about what exactly had been decided and what they were expected to do. They found it difficult to decipher precisely what Dutton and Taylor were saying, or what the plan was on tax – assuming there was one – in their interviews.

At the regular early morning briefing after the budget, before parliament sat, the chief opposition whip, Bert van Manen, and Sukkar, manager of opposition business in the house, told MPs, almost casually, that the government was bringing on the tax legislation for a vote. The meeting took place only minutes before the bills were introduced.

“We thought, based on the language we were hearing, that it was only 70¢ a day, we would just wave them through,” one Liberal backbencher said later.

Only one person thought – or dared – to ask directly which way they were expected to vote. That was Queensland LNP MP Cameron Caldwell, elected to parliament in a byelection less than two years before. Caldwell asked the whip whether they would be voting for or against the tax cuts. “I will get back to you,” Van Manen said. He never did.

That morning Hume, supported by a few others, tried again to get Dutton to reverse his decision. “The idea of voting against a tax cut, that we would go to an election promising to repeal a tax cut, was just crazy,” Hume said later.

In the chamber, as the bells rang, MPs looked around to see which way the shadow ministers were going so they could follow suit. They were confused and mightily embarrassed. Caldwell was completely bewildered by the failure to communicate and by the decision to vote no, thinking that the only reason the leadership would contemplate such an action was if they had something bigger and better to offer. They didn’t.

As Jenny Ware later described it: “We were like lemmings going over a cliff.

“First with the tax-cuts vote, then the announcement that a Liberal government would repeal personal tax cuts, coupled with no economic vision, including nothing for families and small business.”

Ware, a lawyer and first-termer with obvious frontbench potential, lost her NSW seat of Hughes after a two-party-preferred swing against her of 6.5 per cent.

Dutton was convinced Labor’s tax cut had not cut through, nor given them a poll lift. He did not believe people would change their vote for “a couple of dollars”.

“I don’t think it was a factor in the election,” he told me. “People voted on different grounds from that. Their numbers didn’t improve in relation to economic management.”

Dutton was convinced that the February interest-rate cut, and the prospect of two more, had more of an impact on votes and sentiment.

They’re the actual bottom of the barrel at SDN. See, Z-Team have potential, we’ve all played the game, but Y-Team? What a buncha fuckups. They’re literally known as the “Why team”. Because that’s the most commonly asked question anytime anyone thinks about sending them out, because why would you ever do that?


Y-TEAM ROSTER

Dispatcher:

NAME: Owen Halberg (hero name: Backline)

Vibe: A grizzled, “seen everything twice” ex-hero with a dry wit sharp enough to shave with.
Owen is the guy who rolls into work 10 minutes late, limping, sipping gas station coffee, and somehow still solves crises before the rookies finish tying their boots.

He’s sarcastic, short-tempered in a funny way, and heartbreakingly competent. (In terms of physicality, I’ve been picturing Conquest from invincible tbh, it just kinda fits the vibe)

HISTORY

Owen used to be Backline, a frontliner known for holding the line against overwhelming odds. He was one of SDN’s best, the guy you called when the situation was so bad you didn’t want to admit it existed.

Then came “the incident”
A collapsing superstructure crushed half his ribcage and destroyed his powers and heart in the process. Physically he recovered just enough to live normally, but not enough to return to hero work. The SDN offered retirement benefits. Instead, he said: 

“Fuck no. Give me a chair and a headset. I’m not done yelling at people.”

So now he sits behind a desk, barking orders into comms, aching for the day he can get back out there.

POWERS (When He Had Them)

Kinetic Bracing: Owen could anchor himself to a point in space and absorb incoming force on a massive scale.
If a villain threw a car, he’d catch it.
If a building fell, he’d hold it long enough for everyone to run.

Basically the human crash barrier, the immovable object that saves everyone else.

Post-injury?
He’s got enough residual anchor energy to stop small objects, anything larger than a ping pong ball would kill him. However he still understands battlefield physics like a sixth sense. he can tell when a structure’s about to fail, predict impacts, or warn Dispatched heroes of collapsing hazards with ridiculous accuracy.

CURRENT ROLE: Dispatcher

He’s good at it. maybe too good.
He can read security feeds like they’re children’s books, calling out enemy moves before they happen.

But every time he does…
You hear that flicker of longing behind the sarcasm.

He wants back in the field.
Desperately.

He trains quietly after hours slow, stubborn drills, pushing a body that won’t cooperate anymore.

The rookies think he’s just ‘cranky old Owen.m
The veterans know he’s a caged wolf.

PERSONALITY
	•	Dry wit for days
	•	Sarcastic mentor energy
	•	Pretends he hates everyone
	•	Actually cares too much
	•	Keeps a locked case at home with his old hero costume
	•	Once threatened to “unretire violently” when an intern touched his coffee mug

Sample lines:

“I used to stop meteors. Now I stop you morons from killing yourselves with your own stupidity.”

“When I said ‘fall back,’ I didn’t mean on your ass. Get up”


RELATIONSHIP TO STARHOPPER

He’s Starhopper’s reluctant mentor / father figure.

He will never tell Starhopper this, but Owen loves him like one of his old squadmates. He acts annoyed, but every time he does something reckless, Owen’s voice cracks just a little when yelling at him through comms.

He pretends he’s fine being retired.

Starhopper is the one person who sees right through it.


Speaking of… 


1. Starhopper: Teleportation Himbo

(real name: Jack Foley)

Vibes: Jack is the kind of guy who looks like he should be the second coming of the world’s greatest superhero…and then he opens his mouth.

He’s a beautifully built idiot.
A himbo.
A sweet, energetic disaster with the situational awareness of a confused pigeon.

Heroes love him, civilians think he’s endearing, and dispatchers want to put their heads through drywall.

AGE: 23

Young enough to be stupid.
Old enough to be dangerous.
Prime ‘shouldn’t be trusted unsupervised’ energy.

POWERS:

Short range teleportation bursts that he can’t control.

In theory?
He can flicker around the battlefield like a bunny hop Nightcrawler.

In practice?
He has teleported into:
	•	walls
	•	trees
	•	wrong buildings
	•	the backseat of police cars
	•	the second floor of restaurants mid-lunch rush
	•	the villain’s personal bathroom once (while the villain was in there, mind you. He still brags about bringing him in.)

He can absolutely be one of the strongest rookies on the roster…
if he ever gets control of his powers.

PERSONALITY
	•	Loud
	•	Hopeful
	•	Incredibly earnest
	•	Disastrously uncoordinated
	•	Optimistic to the point of delusion
	•	Could talk to a brick wall and somehow lose the argument
	•	The definition of “golden retriever with superpowers”

Sample Lines:

“Dispatch, permission to engage! …Owen? …Owen why are you sighing?”
“Wait, **that’s** the hostage? My bad...”
“I didn’t panic teleport! I *strategically* repositioned.”
“I’m not a disaster. I’m a learning experience!”

HISTORY

Jack grew up idolizing heroes. Posters on the walls, action figures, the works.
When his powers manifested, he joined SDN and somehow passed every trial and interview through a chaotic cocktail of:
	•	raw potential
	•	dumb luck
	•	and stubborn positivity

People say he’s “promising.”
Old timers say he’s “a lawsuit waiting to happen.”

His dispatcher?
He’s convinced Jack will either become the next A list legend… or die teleporting into a volcano. There is no in between.

RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS DISPATCHER (Backline)

(I think i cooked)

Jax thinks Backline is the coolest, toughest, most badass hero who ever lived.

He treats him like a mentor despite Backline repeatedly telling him:

“Kid, I’m not your role model. I’m your traffic controller.”

Backline outwardly hates dispatching for him.

Every call starts with:

“No. Whatever you’re about to do. no.”

But deep down?
He sees himself in the kid.
That raw bravery.
That willingness to throw himself at danger for others.

He calls him an idiot with affection.

Additional info:
	•	Has a fan club already and doesn’t know why
	•	Teleports into trees at least once a week
	•	Keeps a notebook titled “Cool lines to say after punching villains”
	•	Can’t flirt to save his life
	•	Somehow always survives things he shouldn’t survive
	•	Thinks Backline’s old helmet is the coolest, and tried wearing it.
	•	Backline nearly killed him for touching it

2. Pulsebeam

(real name: Mira Kess)

Vibe:

Super cute, super deadpan, sarcastic, and strangely patient with Starhopper.

She treats him like a malfunctioning Roomba: affectionately annoyed, slightly concerned, quietly fond.

Powers:

Bio-electric projection: she can release electric pulses that act like stun shots, EMP bursts, or concentrated beams.

EXTREMELY powerful.
ZERO aim.

She frequently fries traffic lights, electronic billboards, and once accidentally rebooted Backline’s pacemaker implant.

Personality:
	•	Dry as sandpaper
	•	Secret soft spot for idiots
	•	Kinda goth, but in a “I’m tired” way
	•	Loves animals more than humans

If the core of your struggle feels 'undefined'—like you're constantly shapeshifting to fit the needs and expectations of everyone around you—you’re likely operating without defined boundaries. When you don't define yourself, the world will define you, and that definition is often exhausting.

The good news is that definition isn't a grand, spiritual revelation; it's a series of small, practical fences you install daily. 

Here is a simple, actionable 'Stop/Start/Keep' audit you can do right now to begin carving out the space that belongs only to you:

---

### The 5-Minute Definition Audit

**1. STOP (Defining Your Limits):**

Take 60 seconds and identify ONE commitment, behavior, or energy drain you need to cease immediately. This is the activity that leaves you feeling most resentful or depleted. This is not about letting people down; it’s about *not letting yourself down* anymore.

*   *Example: Stop automatically agreeing to weekend social plans when you desperately need rest.* 

**2. START (Defining Your Needs):**

Identify ONE small, non-negotiable action you will START doing today that is purely for your own restoration or joy. This defines the territory of 'You' that others are not allowed to encroach upon. Make it so small it’s impossible to fail.

*   *Example: Start 10 minutes of silent reading before checking your phone, or start drinking a full glass of water every morning before coffee.* 

**3. KEEP (Defining Your Successes):**

Identify ONE positive habit or healthy boundary you currently hold, even if you sometimes struggle with it. Your work here is to acknowledge it and consciously protect it. Defining yourself also means celebrating what you’ve already managed to establish.

*   *Example: Keep the 6 PM device curfew you currently enforce, or keep protecting your weekly therapy slot.*

---

Definition is powerful because it gives you agency. When you feel 'undefined,' you feel powerless. By implementing these three steps, you move from being a vessel others fill to being the architect of your own space. Focus on these three tiny definitions, and watch the vague feeling of being 'undefined' start to solidify into something strong and recognizable: *you*.",1,1763787623.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

I’m considering getting a new one, but I need some tips on how to keep this from happening again. The first time it got stolen was outside of work. It was locked to the bike rack using a chain and u-lock. At the end of my shift,  It was gone without a trace. The second time this happened was outside my apartment complex. This one was probably my fault. I saw some guys touching my bike from my balcony and tell them to get off it. They called me a paranoid asshole and said they weren’t doing anything but two days later it was gone. That one was just as locked up as the other one.

I do not want this to happen to the third one. I am sick to death of people stealing my stuff. Since I finally have my own apartment, I’m planning on keeping it inside when I’m not using it, but that still poses a problem. How can I prevent it from being stolen when I’m on campus? They’ve got bike racks at various locations throughout campus, but I think it’s still very likely that it could get stolen. Not to mention work. They’ve got bike racks at the coffee shop right across the street but none outside of the store I work at.

It’s called habit stacking, and I first read about it in Atomic Habits by James Clear.

The core idea is simple:  
**“After I do X, I will do Y.”**

You take something you already do automatically and attach a new habit to it. The cue is already there you just piggyback the new behavior onto it.

At first, I thought it was unnecessary. I could just decide to do these things. But once I actually tried it, I realized the repetition and strict timing made the habits automatic.

They stopped feeling like decisions and became the natural next step in my day, which is when I started applying it to habbits I wanted to build, **here are some examples:**

* After every focused work block, I do pushups and squats to failure.
* When I lay in bed at night, instead of scrolling on my phone, I read for 30 minutes.
* After I make my morning coffee, I go outside and get sunlight in my eyes.

**I believe that if you have habits you want to build especially the ones that seem easy but you never do anyway, this is a powerful technique for that exact use case.**

**If you’ve tried habit stacking yourself, what habits did you attach it to, and how did it go?**

I’ll write more posts soon about the other Atomic Habits techniques, at least the ones I actively apply like implementation intentions, temptation bundling, the two-minute rule, environment design, identity-based habits, and the inverse methods for stopping bad habits.",7,1763787572.0,getdisciplined,1,0.89,False

Pretty sure it was just a common cold because I was just having nasal congestion, cough, fatigue, muscle aches, and my hearing was muffled. I'm still having a rough cough and some on/off nasal congestion so my body is definitely producing a lot of phlegm/mucus still. I am a smoker and I vape. Yesterday, I smoked about 6 cigs which is more than average (average being 2-3/day). Today, I woke up with a bad cough probably because of how much I smoked and the fact that I'm still getting over the cold. Decided I wouldn't vape or smoke until 5pm today. 

During breakfast, I got this fresh fruit cup from a hospital cafeteria and the more I ate it, the more it tasted like nail polish remover and it became so strong that I ended up spitting it out. I asked another person who had the fruit cup if it tasted bad to them and they said no. I shrugged it off thinking maybe I just got unlucky.

Or maybe the fact that they both so pretty and so into me but I still like him more? I feel like the opposite is more common. But as people, I really feel like the thing w/ him is deeper.

She only wants to kiss me the entire time and at the end of every party she invites me to her house, and I always refuse but it looks like something I can't scape for any longer before she loses interest.

**--- Breaking News ---**

 

Tamara had been lucky. After being picked up by a friendly passerby, she was taken to a women’s shelter. Under the guise of being a victim of abuse, she managed to get off the radar for a couple of days. She wasn’t entirely okay; she would still find bits and pieces of leftover teeth. She would cough them up or pop them from her surface-level skin like a rock-hard zit. It was nasty, but after about a month, it seemed to be fully over. She’d made it. She’d been chewed up and spat out by a cosmic mouth. Now she could promise herself that, no matter what, she would never go through that again.

For a while, her life settled into something that might resemble normalcy. People didn’t ask her too many questions, and no one knew who she was. She was just someone who wandered in from the street in need of help. There was plenty of help to go around. She felt a bit bad about lying, but it was the kinder option. Telling the truth might actually put those people in danger.

She would help with the occasional chores. Cleaning the kitchen, making beds, taking out the trash, that kind of thing. Tamara didn’t mind. It was the kind of thing she’d helped her mom with those last few months. The thought rarely crossed her mind, and for good reason. It had been some of the worst days of her life. Even now, she felt sick to her stomach whenever she admitted to herself that she was happy her mother’s suffering was over.

 

After a while, Tamara helped out with other things. For example, she would go to the supermarket on the corner to get things for the kitchen. Just little things, but enough for her to get a shopping list and get trusted with a bit of money. She couldn’t just sit in her room and wait for the year to end – life doesn’t work that way.

But things rarely worked out the way Tamara expected them to.

One day, as she browsed the produce section, she noticed a cellphone ringing. Another shopper, an elderly woman with thick-rimmed glasses, frowned and answered. After a couple of seconds, she shouted at her phone to ‘not call her again’, before hanging up in a huff. Seconds later, the phone rang again. This time, her anger deflated – replaced with a silent shock.

The elderly woman walked up to Tamara, holding out her phone.

“The man… he says he knows you,” she said.

Tamara took the phone.

 

The voice of Lloyd came through from the other end. The connection was spotty, at best. The volume was turned up way too loud.

“Thank God I got to you,” Lloyd’s voice came through. “I got bad news.”

“How the hell did you find me?”

“That’s just it,” Lloyd said. “That’s the problem. That I *could* find you.”

“So how’d you do it?”

“It’s a long story. But there’s this system that’s coming online, and we gotta be proactive. It’s going to target you, and it’s going to target Perry.”

“Perry? Is he okay?”

“He’s fine, last I checked. Look, you want the short or long version?”

Tamara looked back at the elderly woman who worriedly kneaded her hands.

“Short version.”

 

Lloyd described it as simple as he could. There had been a collaboration between a telecom software developer in the Czech Republic and Hatchet a couple of years ago. They’d made a long-distance body scanner called the Rattler. It could scan people’s bodies and match them to a database, pinpointing locations without the need for cameras. Problem was, the system had gone haywire after accidentally scanning every instance of a known killer – effectively translating him into code, infecting the system. Now this system was breaking out of containment.

“We’re looking at a nearly omniscient techno-horror fuckup. If that thing can take your wish, I don’t wanna know what happens.”  
“And that thing can kill us?”

“If they’re letting the Rattler loose, something’s up. Might be some kind of internal conflict. The European branch is mostly run by the board, so if the field director’s gone haywire, there’s no telling what-“

“Is that a yes? Can it kill us?”

“You need me to spell it out for you? I found you through the same system! It’s coming online as we speak. Do you want to get out of this or not?”

Tamara held up a finger to the old woman, silently asking her to wait for just a little longer.

“Tell me what I gotta do.”

 

To an outsider, what Tamara did next would look very unusual. She would politely hand the phone back, take the money meant for groceries, and walk right out of the supermarket. Two blocks down, she would get on a bus, and she’d never be seen again. They never even knew her full name.

Tamara made her way south, and two days later, she crossed the border to the U.S. There were ways to do it without drawing too much attention, as per Lloyd’s instructions. From there she would walk, hitchhike, and take another bus; passing the state line from Minnesota to Iowa. She was looking for a certain address, and she had a particular set of instructions on how to get there.

Before long, Tamara came walking down a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Her shoes were struggling, breaking at the seams after days of walking. Her legs were buttered up and ready to fold. But when she saw that distant farmhouse, her heart eased. And when she saw two other people coming down the road to meet her, she knew she’d made the right call. A stone fell from her chest as the unmistakable silhouettes of Perry and Evan grew closer.

“Perry!” Tamara called out. “And Bug! That you?”

“Don’t call him that!” Perry yelled back. “You know I don’t like it when you call him that!”

“I don’t see you coming up with any nicknames!”

Turns out, Tamara wasn’t the only one to get a phone call, and she wasn’t the only one who’d listened. And now the two of them had arrived at something that Lloyd called the Foxtrot Silo.

 

There was a lot of catching up to do. They made their way to the abandoned farmhouse down the road, where they sat down by some plastic outdoor furniture. They shared a couple of snacks from Perry’s backpack and split his last can of coke. They took some time to discuss events that had gone down at the Pit, and their separate escapes. Tamara tried not to think too closely about the feeling of a molar growing out of her eye socket, or her lungs filling with loose teeth. Perry, on the other hand, tried not to think about the dozens of corpses he had to wade through to get out.

They discussed Evan’s tracking efforts, and the way he’d made his way across the country with an unusual companion. Tamara didn’t have much to say about her trip; she got by mostly on the kindness of strangers and a can-do attitude. For Perry and Evan, it was a bit more complicated. Luckily, Evan had learned not just how a car works, but how to drive one. But the topic turned sour when they zoned in on what brought them out there in the first place.

“I don’t know what to make of this Rattler thing”, Tamara said. “Killer phones? Can that be real?”

“Yes,” Evan said, matter-of-factly.

“Something you not telling me, Bug?”

Perry gave her a silent “Don’t”. Tamara was impressed by how much he could convey with a single look.

“It is why we are here,” Evan clarified. “It is for your protection.”

“They have cell coverage out here, Evan,” Perry said. “You sure we’re safe?”

“Not here,” Evan said. “We have to go down.”

 

Evan went around the corner. Pulling back a large blue tarp, he revealed a set of double doors; like a root cellar, but large enough to drive a tractor through. He explained as he carefully investigated the locking mechanism, still adorned by a faded blue sunflower.

“Back in the 1980’s, there was a firm specializing in tornado-proof grain silos,” Evan explained. “That firm was, in turn, a subsidiary of Hatchet Agriculture.”

Tamara muttered under her breath.

“It is an underground grain silo. They were deemed too expensive to make, so the project was abandoned and repurposed. According to our contact-“

“Lloyd,” Perry added. “We don’t have to be coy about him.”

“According to *Lloyd*,” Evan corrected, “This was the Foxtrot Silo. There is shelter deep enough to shield you from interference.”

“A shelter that’s been decommissioned for close to fifty years,” Tamara added. “Lovely.”

“That is correct. Clarification; about the age, not the condition.”

 

As the sun began to set, Evan figured out the locking mechanism. The doors creaked open like a yawning metal giant, and they had to pull at the doors from either side using hooked rods for leverage. The hinges were rusted shut, requiring a couple of swift bangs from a sledgehammer that Perry pulled out of a crumbling storage shack. Slowly but surely, the old air was let out, and the way forward opened.

The silo itself was long since empty. The space expanded downward in an hourglass shape, all brought together in solid concrete. There was a catwalk spiraling downward to a set of doors, leading into the main shelter. Making their way down, Perry couldn’t help but notice how stale and moldy the air was. It must have been stagnant for decades.

They entered a dark corridor. Tamara used a flashlight, but Evan took point. Down the corridor, and to a sudden left, there was a door behind a set of heating ducts. And in there – was a shelter.

 

The Foxtrot Silo had been a repurposed Hatchet fallback point for decades, but it was largely forgotten. There was a freshwater pump by the rear wall, and there were plenty of amenities. A couple of beds, a kitchen, lights, a bathroom with a shower – plenty of comforts. Problem was, it hadn’t been used for a long time. There was no power, and the mattresses were riddled with mouse crap. It was gonna be hell to clean this place out.

“I’m not so sure about this one,” Perry said. “It, quite literally, looks like shit.”

“It is safe,” Evan said. “Comforts can be arranged.”

“You think you can get the power working?” Tamara asked.

“Yes.”

With that, Evan was out the door and on his way up the stairs. He wasn’t one to stick around to talk when there was work to do. Tamara shook her head.

“I don’t get you two,” she smiled. “You have any idea why he’s so attached?”

“He is?” Perry asked.

“I think so, yeah. Then again, he’s a bit hard to read.”

“I think it’s like when you learn a new language. You need someone to practice with on the regular. I think it’s something similar when you’re learning to be a person. You need someone who doesn’t judge you when you get things wrong.”

“But you trust him, right? You don’t think he’d go behind your back, given the chance?”

Perry didn’t even look up.

“Never.”

 

They spent the day clearing the shelter. They brought down buckets, soap, and a mop. Perry used a set of kitchen towels to scrub the bathroom. Step by step they cleaned the floor and kitchen counters, while Evan went out looking for supplies. Later in the afternoon, he would return with a fresh set of mattresses, claiming simply that they “do not need to worry about it”.

After a 16-hour cleaning session, they got the power running. The air filter made some alarming noises, and there was a bit of a strange lemon-scented smell, but at least it was no longer a choking hazard. By the end of the night, Evan had hooked up a radio from the surface to a speaker down in the shelter. That way they could at least listen to something. He could probably set up a DVD player too, if they were expecting a prolonged stay.

And that was the biggest issue of the moment – if this Rattler was a real thing, how long could they expect to be there? They couldn’t wait out the Yearwalk in an underground shelter; they had to get to Frog Lake and finish the walk.

 

But that was a worry for another day. For now, they’d put in the hours, and they could rest with a clean conscience. Tamara didn’t take much convincing. Before she even got her socks off, she was face down in her bed, sleeping soundly. Perry, on the other hand, sat up with Evan a little longer. They talked a little bit about practical matters and hopes for the weeks to come, but there was a silence that lingered. After his time in the Pit, Perry had been right about one thing; he hadn’t gotten used to soft beds yet. There was a darkness in his stomach, an anxious and uncomfortable thought that maybe he was still in his cell, one way or another. Evan, looking at him, noticed the concerned expression. He figured he could provide a distraction.

“Why did your family disown you?” he asked.

“That’s… a bit out of left field there, Evan.”

“I wish to know.”

Perry mock-protested but welcomed the distraction. It was a loaded question, but Evan could be forgiven for not following established social norms.

“I’m thinking about how to phrase this in a way that makes sense to you,” Evan said. “I suppose one way to say it is that I don’t wish to, uh… *biologically procreate*.”

“Are you sterile?”

“No, but my choice of partner isn’t compatible.”

“Why do you choose incompatible partners?”

“It’s not a *choice* per se, it’s just that…”

Perry waved his hands around, as if trying to catch the right word out of the air. Finally, he gave up.

“It’s simple. Two males can’t have children,” he said.

Evan considered this. He wasn’t well-versed with human societal norms, but he could make an educated guess.

“Your parents wish for you to have a compatible mate. To bring offspring.”

“I suppose they do.”

“But you are incapable.”

“Not incapable, I can still raise a child. I can have a surrogate too, if I want, I just… it’s not *just* about children. But it’s just one of *many* sticking points, I guess.”

“I understand,” Evan said. “Their expectation is for you to continue their lineage, and you are unwilling.”

“That’s one way to put it.”

“Is it inaccurate?”

“Not really. Just sounds a bit harsh. Like I’m the problem.”

Perry closed his eyes, letting the conversation continue at the edge of sleep. It was nice talking to Evan. He had a strange voice, but once you got used to it, it was unusually comforting. Like learning how to drink a proper cup of black coffee.

“If all salmon stopped swimming upstream, there would be no salmon,” Evan said. “If a salmon swims the wrong way, the most likely reason is that there is something wrong with it.”

“Is that what you think? That there’s something wrong with me?”

“No,” Evan said, matter-of-factly. “I do not.”

“How come?”

“Because you are not salmon.”

Perry couldn’t help but grin. He yawned, letting a final comment drift him off to sleep.

“You’re right, Evan,” he mumbled. “I’m… not salmon.”

Evan mouthed the words ‘glub glub’ as he closed the door, letting his friends rest.

 

The next few days were busy. They continued clearing the shelter. They listened to the radio. They got a message from Lloyd saying he had confirmation that the Rattler was coming online on the east coast. After that, he went radio silent. They would most likely not hear from him for a long time.

“Stay off the grid,” Lloyd warned in his final message. “Things are about to go crazy.”

While Tamara and Perry made their space more livable, Evan had another project in mind. He’d seen a junkyard not too far away, and a couple of nighttime raids netted him a couple of crucial items. It didn’t look much to the world; just a microwave, some cobber tubing, an old ham radio and a couple of car batteries. But with a final component, it would turn into something else. After vandalizing a nearby cell phone tower, he had his creation ready. A primitive signal jammer, about the size of a laundry basket. If the Rattler was something that used cell phone signals, this could give them a little breathing space if Perry or Tamara had to go above ground for a while.

Evan enjoyed tinkering with things that challenged him. While it didn’t take him long to read up on the background theory of the technology itself, it took plenty of time to procure and test the right components. They had to have the right specifications, and sometimes things would work out differently in practice than theory. That’s where he *really* found a challenge.

He figured that the Rattler was trained on data from people and animals. Even if it managed to scan him, it wouldn’t be able to affect him. It simply didn’t have the training data. One of few advantages of being one-of-a-kind.

 

They all met up in the shelter. Perry was cooking up some ravioli and bell peppers, sending a mild pasta smell wafting through the hallway. Tamara didn’t mind. It was miles better than the chlorine she’d been inhaling. That stuff had to be bad for her lungs.

The radio crackled to life. There was always something going on. Every day, there were breaking news. Armed confrontations. Riots. Recently, there’d been armed guards breaking up a six-hour filibuster. But this time, there was something unusual in the newscasters’ voice.

*“We’re getting reports of a developing situation, we are-“*

There was hesitation. A pause, someone reading off a prompter.

*“A recent development of a diplomatic meeting between the delegates of-“*

The voice crackled as the signal swayed.

*“-has resulted in four dead, including the supreme leader of-“*

More interference.

*“-while officials adamantly deny foul play by the state intelligence community, evidence points to the deployment of supersonic weapons and-“*

Perry turned to the radio, putting down his spatula. Tamara looked up at him. The reporter stumbled through the news. Was this the Rattler? Was this what it could *do?*

 

More reports were coming in. A foreign leader dropping dead in the middle of cutthroat negotiations. A senator dying on live television. A dozen confirmed cases of deaths along the coast of New England, including a truck driver – in turn killing four in a violent pile-up along the interstate.

In all cases, victims were confirmed to have died from a violent seizure. Neither had a history of epilepsy. Witnesses would describe it as a ‘rattle’ in the air, making the victim vibrate to the point where muscle and fat tissue would separate from the bone.

Cruise captains. Air traffic controllers. Train operators. Victim, after victim, after victim; names rolling across the states in a span of less than 12 hours. Attempts to take cell phone towers offline resulted in additional deaths as telecommunication workers were found dead in their homes – seemingly dying from sudden and violent seizures.

Broadcasts would be interrupted by more important broadcasts, that would be interrupted by even more important broadcasts, that would be interrupted by emergency public messages. People were urged to stay away from train stations, highways, airports, and subways.

Emergency broadcast messages. Stay indoors. Get out of your cars. Move underground.

Breaking news. Breaking news. Breaking news.

 

Tamara and Perry huddled around the crackling speaker long into the night. There were missile warnings going out on the west coast as adversarial nations fired warning shots. Diplomatic lines are cut, making peaceful solutions impossible.

Perry had never considered that this could be the way things would end. That the world would self-destruct overnight, long before he and Tamara ever finished their Yearwalk. If this was what the Rattler was capable of, there was no telling what it might do in another week, or a month. Before the end of the year, there’d be nuclear war.

“…I thought we’d go long before the world did,” Tamara muttered as the alarms kept blaring. “If everything dies, what’s left to fucking save?”

“Maybe it’s not like that. Maybe it looks worse than it is.”

“A ‘supreme leader’ lies dead on U.S. soil, Perry. Whatever the Rattler is, I think it’s looking to stir some shit up.”

“You think it’s smart enough to do that?”

“If it is, it’s only a matter of time before it figures out we’re wish-piñatas.”

“Then we better lay low.”

Tamara nodded as Perry handed her a couple of saltines. It was going to be a long night.

 

The next few days were tense. Deployment of fighter jets. Nuclear submarines on standby. But it was also starting to get *weird*. A live news broadcast was interrupted by a passerby screaming at the camera that they ‘had no choice’ and that they were ‘sorry’ before firing twelve rounds into a crowd. Similar incidents were reported in St. Louis, Chicago, Charlotte, Atlanta and Memphis. One report spoke of bodies getting hung from the traffic lights in praise of the ‘Lord of Bones’.

While Perry and Tamara didn’t have any phones, Evan kept one around to check for emergency alerts. Those, too, were going haywire. Warning of a plane crash. Pile-up on the highway. Gas leak. Toxins. Sewage leak. But there were also just… *strange* messages. Evan would get messages from anonymous numbers that seemingly targeted him.

*“You have your mother’s ribcage.”*

And seconds later…

*“Where are you hiding them?”*

 

There were general power surges and issues with running water. Evan could see the streetlights flicker on and off as emergency power failed. Luckily, the shelter was hooked up to a local generator, running solely on diesel. The thing was noisy and let out a worrying amount of black smoke, but Evan was sure it would hold for as long as it had to.

Despite the warnings, there were still cars on the road. Even out there, in the middle of nowhere. The landscape was so flat you could see their silhouette in the distance, reaching all the way to the curvature of the horizon. But there weren’t just cars, there were people too.

And some of those people were heading their way.

 

Evan kept his distance as a group came wandering down the road. A dozen men, some of them visibly armed with hunting rifles and shotguns. Others held more discrete weapons, like knives and handguns. It was simple; they weren’t there to negotiate. You didn’t bring that kind of weaponry without expecting trouble. Evan pulled the tarp over the metal doors and hurried inside the abandoned farmhouse for cover.

The men stopped at the edge of the property to check their phones. They seemed to confirm the location as they stepped closer, entering the property. They stuck together, refusing to let anyone be singled out. Despite Evan being a capable monstrosity in his own right, being peppered with bullets would take the sting out of him. He had to be clever about this.

“Check for the jammer,” said a man with a rifle. “Bones said there’d be a jammer.”

“I think I hear a generator,” said another.

“Get that too.”

Evan figured the Rattler had done something to convince them to fetch the Yearwalkers by hand. It made sense, in a way. If it couldn’t reach them, it had to extend its reach. It had probably threatened each and every person in that group.

Evan watched them as they moved. No one was breaking off. They were sticking together, watching each other’s backs. This was going to be difficult.

 

The generator was technically running through a cable passing by the farmhouse. With a bit of tampering, Evan figured he could misdirect a power surge to something inside the house. If so, he could cause a distraction.

He snuck out back, double-checking before he moved in the open. The mob was prioritizing the jammer – a lucky break. Sort of. It gave him enough time to put his plan to work. With a surge of power, an old light bulb flickered, overloaded, and cracked; sending a sound like a small-arms gunshot ringing through the house. From the other side of the building, Evan heard a man call out.

“Get to cover! In there!”

He needed something big. They were too many to take out head-on in the open.

 

Making his way up onto the roof, Evan looked over the edge as the mob cleared the house, room by room, floor by floor. They were surprisingly efficient. Ex-military, he figured. If he could get the drop on them in a confined space, he would stand a chance. As he heard them enter the room below, he prepared himself. He took a deep breath, and settled his weight on a weak part of the roof; collapsing onto the group below.

A dust cloud of smoke and wooden beams. One of the men collapsed from the sheer weight coming down. Another had his arm torn from his socket like a toy soldier being played with by a nasty kid. The smell of the house went from mold and dust to deoxygenated blood in a heartbeat, as Evan turned to dart away for a second attack.

Then, something hit him. Something he hadn’t anticipated.

He never thought they’d be crazy enough to use firebombs indoors.

 

A sea of fire cascaded over his back, digging its roots into his shielding membrane. He could feel his wings curl up and crackle as nerve endings burned and died. One by one, he shut them down, replacing them with whatever he could muster from his biological reserves. The men called out and scattered to the wind, disappearing down different hallways and rooms. As Evan was baited into a chase, whoever was chased would run while the others provided cover fire.

There was no way he could win this. He tried to make it back onto the roof, but his wings were too torn. He tried to put out the fire, but the wood dust had ignited and turned the bedroom into a tinder box. The mob was spreading out, fleeing out the windows. Evan had to think, and he had to think fast.

He considered his options. He could crash out the window, but that would leave him out in the open. He could stay inside, but he would be burned to a crisp. Inside. Outside. Anywhere.

He considered his options. He considered them again.

Again, again, again.

But the fire didn’t stop.

 

Down in the shelter, Perry listened closely. He could hear screams and gunfire. Tamara paced back and forth. Perry looked to her with visible sweat forming on his forehead.

“Why isn’t Evan coming back down?” he said. “What’s he doing? Is he winning?”

“I don’t know,” Tamara. “They’re still talking.”

The lights went out. The airflow stopped, slowing to a halt. The radio prattled on.

*“-of the utmost importance that we stay rational. That we stay logical. That we trust in state, in union, in God-“*

Voices from above. Metal creaking. They’d removed the tarp.

They were coming down.

 

“I don’t know what to do,” said Perry. “We got nothing. We… can’t do anything.”

“There’s gotta be something,” Tamara said. “A… a knife. A fucking meat mallet. Perry! Think!”

“There’s nothing!”

The voices were louder. They could hear them. They were advancing, opening one door after another. They were almost there. Perry could see sparkles from a flashlight touching the hinges of the door.

It was too late. Anything short of holding his breath, and they’d hear him. But there was only one door. It was over.

 

As Tamara grabbed a knife from the kitchen, Perry came to think of something.

Back at the Pit, his simulated uncle had said something curious.

*“I don’t think I would say something simple as ‘save my nephew’. I think I would come up with something smarter than that.”*

Something smarter than that. Maybe there was something more to his wish. Something that was still active. Something that was, in some way, protecting him. The radio continued to croak.

*“-believe in your family. Your bonds of friendship. This is not normal. We are not living in normal times. But normal will come again-“*

Perry walked up to the door. Tamara gasped as he flung the doors wide open.

 

Perhaps it was a twist of fate. Perhaps it was a conscious choice by an entity that was entirely unknown to him. Either way, Perry hadn’t considered that the door opened outward. He also didn’t consider that the light from outside might not be a flashlight at all. He certainly hadn’t considered the option that it might have been a lit firebomb.

He smacked the door open, sending the man in the front stumbling backwards; dropping his firebomb.

Perry shut the door as an explosion rocked the hall.

 

There was smoke and fire creeping across the door. Tamara turned around fast. She took a moment to digest the fact – fire. From there, she made a plan. She rushed to the freshwater pump, where three buckets had been prepared. She poured one over herself and threw the other over Perry.

“We gotta run,” she wheezed. “We gotta open those doors, and we gotta-“

The door collapsed. People were screaming in the hallway. Someone was shooting. Tamara grabbed Perry by the arm and pulled him along.

The fire sizzled against their skin as they dashed across squirming bodies. Their vision went black as smoke filled the hall. For the second time, Perry had to wade through death and decay – this time, of his own making.

Was this Uncle John’s doing? His wish, manifesting a will for them to meet again?

Or was he just damn lucky?

The smoke cleared. The path was open. A bullet whirled by as they rounded a corner and bolted upstairs. A fire-drenched voice cried out from below.

*“He knows me! He knows my family! I’m sorry! I’m sorry-“*

 

They made it out and slammed the iron doors shut, locking them from outside. Smoke was filling up below. Whoever survived the fire would choke from the fumes. There was more gunfire as shots ricocheted off the metal doors. Perry took one look at the burning farmhouse.

“Evan.”

Tamara called out, but Perry didn’t care. Evan wouldn’t leave them to die like that. Something must’ve happened. Perry rushed to the front door, but it was swallowed in an inferno. Perry called out, but there was no response. He could barely hear his own voice over the crackling flames. There was nothing he could do; the house was as good as gone. He would just be throwing himself on a pyre. Was that what Evan had done?

Tamara caught up with him. Perry didn’t even notice himself yelling at the top of his lungs. Tamara pulled him back, keeping him from stumbling into the flames headfirst. Perry cried out the name of his friend, over and over, until it was less of a name and more of a noise. He gave up on the name entirely, instead settling into a single, desperate, monotone, scream.

And nothing would come to answer him.

 

The two of them collapsed as the house fire roared. Somewhere to their side, the radio let out a static burst. Tamara turned her head.

“…yearwalker,” a shrill voice spoke. “…yearwalker, I see you.”

Tamara casually turned a little to her left and re-engaged the jammer. Just the flip of a switch. The radio died as a steady noise settled in its place. She leaned into Perry and held him close, letting the scream of the flames drown out his cries. She rubbed his back as the top floor collapsed. And with that, the weight settled into the middle of the house, sending it crumbling to the ground in a raging bonfire.

There would be no firetrucks or wailing sirens. When you fear an entire nation going up in flames, one house doesn’t even register.

 

By sunrise, there was nothing but ashes. It’s like the fire had moved on to the horizon, bathing the flat fields in orange and yellow. Tamara and Perry stayed close to the jammer, hoping it would keep them safe a little longer. Perry looked like a different man, his face hardened. He’d run out of tears.

“I want to see him,” he said.

“It’s just ashes,” Tamara hushed. ”Don’t do this to yourself.”

“I want to see him,” he repeated.

“We shouldn’t-“

Perry jerked to his feet, grabbing the jammer with both hands. Tamara tried to keep up, urging him to let go.

 

There was nothing but beams and walls and ash. Perry could barely breathe as he stumbled over the embers, coughing up black dust as he went along. Tamara tried to pull him back, but he tore himself free. He threw the jammer aside, allowing him to dig elbow-deep into the rubble. Tamara caught the jammer, if only barely.

“Please, Perry, you’re hurting yourself.”

“I’m no fucking salmon,” Perry muttered.

“What?”

“I’m no fucking salmon!” he repeated. “This is me, swimming down the *wrong* *stream!* It’s what I do! It’s what I fucking am! So let me *do this*, Tamara!”

He dug his fingers into the embers, turning his hands an ashen black. He looked past the burnt fabric, the broken furniture, and the skeleton of a generational building. Nothing but death and coal. Tamara didn’t stop him. Not anymore.

 

One of the shapes looked different. It had arms.

Curled up under layers and layers of debris was the charred remains of Evan. His decrepit wings curled into a ball. Nothing about him looked remotely human anymore – the illusion was left in the cinders.

“Perry-“

“I got to get him out,” Perry sobbed. “We can’t leave him here.”

He pulled until his hands were raw and red. Finally, he got a good grip of Evan’s arm. He pulled – and it came loose, crumbling in his hands.

 

Perry turned around, kicking and screaming – throwing the ash to the winds. Tamara held the jammer close, hoping she was near enough for him to be safe. There was nothing she could say. She had to let this play out.

Turning back to face the damage, Perry’s face twisted. Not out of anger, or grief – but surprise.

There was something moving.

 

Just under the surface of Evan’s charred remains, there was something writhing. A white, almost translucent creature. Something moving *inside* him, as if the charred remains were a shell.

“…Evan?”

A resonant amalgamation of voices answered his question.

*“…glub glub.”*

 

Evan had considered all his options. In the end, he couldn’t do it all. The only option he had was to save his own life, and to trust in his friends to do the rest. Even if he didn’t particularly value his own life at times, he didn’t want to imagine how his death might affect the others. As the fires engulfed him, he had cocooned himself, using his own skin as a protective moult. It would take some time to recover his shell, but he was relieved to see he’d made the right choice.

And although his hand was slimy, and his body weak, he allowed himself to be pulled out of the rubble. Perry let his trembling companion lean on him as they made their way out into the morning light. Away from the smoke and decay.

Just wondering if anyone has experience living near Yuanshan MRT Station on the red line in Taipei. 

I am looking at renting an apartment there, literally a 3 minute walk west from the MRT station, and wondering what the area is like ? Coffee , restaurants, bars ( Meiji square of course) gyms... Etc and also I noticed that the apartment is directly in the flight path  of songshan airport. How good is the isolation there ? ( Building I am looking at is 10 years old) And how annoying noticeable are the landing ? I see runway 10 is used primarily for landing and takeoff so only landing really come overhead ? And is it just the big jets that are noticeable ? 

Just looking for some advice before making the decision I will go walk around there today and get a feeling as well.

And I don’t mean friendly small talk. I mean full-on unsolicited life coaching like I’m some lost soul he picked up from the street.

The thing is… I don’t even talk to this guy. I literally just exist outside my door and he thinks it’s a good time to lecture me.

Example:
I’m taking out the trash, minding my own business, and he goes, “You should wake up earlier. Successful people start their day at 4.”
Sir, I barely survive waking up at 7. If I try 4, you’ll be seeing my ghost instead.

Another day, I’m leaving for work holding an iced coffee because my soul depends on it, and he says, “You drink too much sugar. That’s why you look exhausted.”
No sir, I look exhausted because I’m employed.

The final one that made me want to evaporate:
I’m watering my plants, vibing, literally not hurting anybody. And he walks over just to say, “You should start a business. Don’t waste your youth.”
Bro, I’m trying to keep ONE plant alive. Let’s not jump to entrepreneurship.

So I finally told him, nicely, that he doesn’t need to comment on my life every single time he sees me. And now he’s acting like I insulted his ancestors. He sighs whenever I walk by. He avoids eye contact dramatically. It’s like living next to a telenovela character.

So now I’m wondering:

I’m 23F (I’m very gay but apparently look straight to everyone). I currently work in a small town middle school, and have a massive crush on the Pride-club advisor (late 20s F).

There’s a big issue…. she mighttttt have a boyfriend …. I’m not really sure. I think I might have over heard her talking about a boyfriend once the last time we worked together but it was never explicitly stated that this guy she mentioned once was her boyfriend. So… haha that’s a struggle.

Anyways, here are some examples of what I’m dealing with: •  She stares at me from the cafeteria windows at lunch duty, then looks away the second I noticed. •  I said a strong “hi” once in the hallway and she looked straight at the floor, whispered the tiniest nervous “hi,” and practically speed-walked away. •  She never initiates saying hi first, ever. •  But she stands SO close when we end up near each other (like personal-space-is-a-myth close) and gets super fidgety/nervous. • she hid outside the faculty bathroom by the windows picking at her nails as soon as she heard her voice. • always seems to be conveniently near me, looks straight at me but still acts like I’m not there

For more context: Two years ago we worked together for 6 weeks. She and my mentor-teacher from my student teaching placement shared a room. And she straight-up ignored me the whole time. Didn’t even try to be “friendly” by even saying hello in the morning. And for more context, this is my hometown middle school. I pretty much know everyone there, as I had them when I was a student back in the day. But this teacher is new within the last few years. Basically all the other teachers I know always say hi to me and don’t ignore me flat out. They are all super kind and don’t come with this weird energy.

Now … the best part? She’s leaving her current 7th grade ELA position because the high school teacher resigned …. And now… I’m applying for the 7th grade position as I’m just about done with my master’s.  The tension is unreal.

I wrote her a “professional” letter congratulating her on her move to the high school, and asking her if she would ever be willing to chat over coffee about ELA curriculum stuff. When I go to school on Monday I plan on just dropping the envelope in her mail box…. Should I actually give it to her or am I about to humiliate myself with a straight/closeted girl? (Not that I’m fully out either — I’m halfway out of the closet. But that a long story for another day.)

My first question would be does Christianity even exist in ABO content? Like would it be included in the story but changed to fit the ABO style? Like, for example, “marriage should be between one man and one woman”, would that change to something like “one alpha with one omega”. Would Alpha/Alpha be like homosexuality in the old days?

Would marriage even matter if there is just a mating bite?

What would a puritan society be like in ABO with the heat/rut cycle? Think like “The Scarlet Letter”, but in an ABO fic.

I would also like to say that I am not overtly religious but I love to study and expand my viewpoints surrounding how religion shapes one’s human experience.

1p3ke6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1p3ke6j/i_need_advice_my_landlord_keeps_harassing_me_and/,I need advice. My landlord keeps harassing me and I’m mentally exhausted. (California),"Hi everyone. I really need some advice because I’m honestly reaching my limit mentally.

I live in California and I rent a room in a 3-bedroom house. Each tenant has their own room, and we share the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. One important detail: according to the lease, we do NOT pay for utilities (water, electricity, gas). The landlord pays them. He also does not live in the house.

I have high-functioning autism, so I get overwhelmed easily… but at this point I think anyone would be exhausted in my situation.

Here’s what my landlord does on a daily basis:
	We are not allowed to open windows while the AC is running. He locked the AC control panel.
	We cannot do laundry from 5–8 PM.
	He constantly comes to the house and gives unsolicited “advice” to all tenants.
	One day I walked out of the bathroom and he immediately told me:
“You should pee sitting down, I do that myself.”
	If I’m making coffee in the kitchen, he will come over and give “tips.”
	He lectures us to close the fridge, turn off the lights, “because the bill is running.”
	If I step away from washing dishes for a moment, he tells me to turn off the water.
	When doing laundry, he lectures about:
	cleaning the lint filter,
	closing the machine doors,
	not washing between 5–8 PM,
	washing everything at once so “the meters don’t spin too much.”

And yes — he is completely serious about all of this. Even the “pee sitting down” thing. It’s absurd, honestly.

On top of all that, his brother constantly comes to the house. They move cars to the backyard, repair them, repaint them — I’m pretty sure they buy damaged auction cars, fix them, and resell them.

The past few weeks they’ve been repairing cars literally right under my window. I’ve kept my curtains closed for two weeks straight so he doesn’t look into my room when I’m home.

I’m an immigrant from Russia (landlord is also from a former USSR country but has lived here a long time). I really don’t know my rights here. I’m scared to say anything because I’m afraid he will try to evict me.

I also don’t have the money to move right now. I don’t have the deposit + first month saved. I can’t even spare an extra $150 at the moment.

All of this is wearing me down. I’m extremely tired, stressed, and honestly on the edge of depression because I feel trapped and powerless.

So my questions are:
	Is any of this legal in California?
	Do I have any tenant protections?
	What can I realistically do if I can’t afford to move yet?
	How do I deal with a landlord who micromanages my daily life?
       Also, when I finally save enough money to move out, will I be able to leave the same day without any problems? Or are there specific rules in California about notice periods that I should know about?

You know the type. Dimensions stacked like a Jenga tower, hidden lines turned on for no reason, centerlines floating in space. At one point I joked that the only thing missing was a coffee stain and a hand drawn arrow on the PDF.

The funny thing is that these messy drawings ended up teaching me something valuable when I started experimenting with automation and AI tools for drafting. The biggest surprise was that AI actually learns the most from the worst examples. Not the perfect drawings with clean intent, but the chaotic stuff we usually hide in a folder labeled dont open.

Anyone who has been in this field long enough knows that every shop, every engineer, every CAD operator has their own habits. Good or bad, those habits show up in the drawings. When an AI system is trained on real world output, it starts to recognize patterns behind the chaos. For example, maybe your team dimensioned holes three different ways, but all three methods point to the same design intent. Maybe some drawings use ordinate dimensions while others mix baseline and chain dimensions. Humans see inconsistency. AI sees that there is still an underlying structure to follow.

One lesson I learned is that bad drawings teach rules through contrast. The AI starts to detect what is noise and what is meaningful. A hole callout placed slightly wrong still tells you what the hole is supposed to be. A broken section view still hints at which features matter most. Over time the system figures out which habits it should copy and which ones it should quietly fix. And honestly it is not very different from how junior engineers learn. They see enough good and bad examples, and eventually they sort out what actually matters.

Another interesting side effect is that messed up drawings force the AI to get better at context. When everything is clear, the system can just follow the template. When everything is a mess, it has to truly understand the geometry, the feature intent, the tolerances, and the logic behind how humans communicate design. It becomes less of a copying machine and more of a real drafting assistant that can spot oddities and make decisions.

Of course this is not an excuse for sloppy drawings. Anyone who has worked with manufacturing teams knows that clean drawings save real money. But it is reassuring to know that even the ugly stuff sitting on your server can help improve the automation pipeline instead of holding it back.

I am curious how others see this. Do you think learning from flawed drawings makes automation smarter, or does it risk reinforcing bad habits instead?",1,1763786433.0,CADAI,1,1.0,False

1p3kbvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1p3kbvz/event_decree_900/,[EVENT] Decree 900,"#October 20th, 1952

*Decree 900.* 

Agrarian Reform. The core tenant of Arbenz's campaign consists of the idea that land reform is a neccesity for Guatemalan society. Since the 1944 Revolution, progressive and revolutionary forces in Guatemalan society have long hailed agrarian reform as necessary for the nation's social and economic uplifting. Yet doubts began to arise in July of 1952 when Arbenz went quiet on this front - for months various factions within his government began to speculate that he had abandoned that promise. Protests had begun arising in Guatemala City. 

Yet October has seen the flourishing of this promise once and for all. Decree 900, or the Agrarian Reform Law, was passed on October 20th at 11:00 PM. It swiftly passed through the Guatemalan Congress and was ratified by the eager president. The actual body of the act is simplistic and direct - but the various provisions which follow it are extensive. 

**Land Provisions**

• All unused land greater than 90 hectares (224 acres) will be redistributed to the peasantry. Landowners shall be compensated with government bonds for this seized land. 

• Land on estates sized from 91–272 ha (224–672 acres), on which less than two-thirds of the land was cultivated, will have their lands redistributed. 

• Land from 1,700 estates will be redistributed to about 500,000 individual in total - around a sixth of the republic's population. Indigenous groups, long deprived of their own lands, are expected to be the biggest beneficiary of this land reform. 

• The total redistribution of government owned land, which are managed under *fincas nacionales*, or national farms, will be redistributed. Priority will be given to veterans and soldiers of the Guatemalan Army, but ultimately all remaining government lands will be redistributed to the peasantry. In total, these lands account for one fourth of the nation's coffee production. 

• Decree 900 also involves the expropriation of 690 ha (1,700 acres) of Árbenz's own land and 490 ha (1,200 acres) belonging to foreign minister Guillermo Toriello. The Minister of Agriculture Nicolás Brol will also have some of his land redistributed.

**Labour Provisions** 

• Decree 900 abolishes slavery, unpaid labor, work as payment of rent, and prevents the forceful relocation of indigenous workers. 

• This specific provision shall be enforced through the National Agrarian Department's labour section which is under the overall command of Waldemar Barrios Klee. The National Agrarian Department is authorized to make arrests as necessary in order to bring an immediate end to these immoral practices. 

**Mechanisms of Land Redistribution** 

• The National Agrarian Department will be the official government agency directing the effort land reform within the country. In turn, Decree 900 also establishes Local Agrarian Committees (CALs) to oversee land redistribution at the local level. 

• CALs will make decisions on how to reappriopiate lands from local landowners. Furthermore, persons without land will be required to file requests for land through these CALs in order to maintain national stability. 

• The committees will be formed from local groups and shall be established across all 22 departments of the republic. 

• The option of lifetime tenure rather than outright private ownership will be left out as a choice for the peasantry. This is to prevent the landowners from simply buying their lands back at the completion of land reform. 

• The law establishes a system for using bonds to compensate people who lost acres to peasants. Property owners will be paid in bonds which matured in 25 years; value of the land taken will be based on claims made on the previous year's tax returns.

**Land and Credit** 

Credit for those receiving land is mandated by decree 900, through the National Agrarian Bank (BNA). The government is set to dispense around $3,300,00 in loans through the National Agrarian Bank. 

**Further Elements** 

Decree 900 has incited immediate opposition from landowners and some elements within the military. As a response, Arbenz has mobilized the National Guard - currently numbered at 6,000 newly trained militants - to enforce government power across the whole of Guatemala's 22 departments. However the National Guard is also mobilized due to another reason - to prevent clashes between the landowners and peasantry over land disputes. 

Guatemala City intends to prevent chaos seen in other waves of land reform, such as China, which - while the numbers are not yet fully known - led to a great loss of life. The National Guard is armed with new weaponry purchased from neutral European powers as a further guarantee of their and the government's power. 

The Guatemalan Army's capital contingent is also mobilized to lead the effort in maintaining peace across Guatemala.  

Union and government representatives will be sent across the countryside to spread word of Decree 900 to the masses. The National Guard and Capital Contingent will open up all roads across the country to allow for the ease in transportation of government assets. 

President Arbenz has begun a national tour across all 22 departments of the country in order to personally spread word of the land reform. His message is centered around Article 1 of Decree 900: 

> The Agrarian Reform of the October Revolution intends to eliminate the feudal property structure in the countryside and develop relations of production that originate to develop the land to the form of operational and capitalist methods of production in agriculture and to prepare the way for the industrialization of Guatemala

I didn’t get much sleep that night.

The thing that looked like me kept coming back to my bedroom window, scratching at the glass with this patient, methodical rhythm—tap… scrape… tap…—as if it had all the time in the world. Every sound felt deliberate. Testing me. Listening for my reaction. Once or twice I could swear I saw the faint outline of its ear pressed to the pane, like it was trying to hear me breathe.

Eventually, I abandoned my bed and curled up on the couch instead. Vivienne stayed near the window, watching in this unnervingly calm way, ready to stop it if it tried anything else. She didn’t say she was protecting me. She didn’t need to. I could feel the tension radiating off her like static.

I kept blinking at the ceiling, counting scratches until they blurred together. At some point, the world went from night-black to that pale early-morning color—blue, then gray, then something almost normal. The scratching stopped. Its presence slipped away like a held breath finally released.

But it didn’t feel gone. Not really. More like it had stepped back into the tree line to watch.

That thing wasn’t obsessed with me in a flattering way. I felt hunted.

“You’re going to need to go to work and act normal,” Vivienne said softly. She didn’t sound tired, even though she hadn’t slept either. “If people start worrying about you… It could get messy.”

Her voice was gentle, but her expression stayed unreadable. Too composed, too controlled. But her tone—there was something protective in it. Even after she’d threatened me not to say a word to anyone.

“That makes sense,” I muttered, rubbing my eyes. My whole body felt off—heavy legs, jittery hands, that wired exhaustion you only get from a night full of adrenaline. “But what if it hears my voice again? You said it only needed to hear me one more time.”

Vivienne hesitated—really hesitated. “I’m handling that part. Just… trust me for today.”

I gave a small, shaky laugh. I tried to take it as reassurance. I wasn’t sure it was.

My morning routine felt like moving underwater. Brush teeth. Comb hair. Try not to stare too hard at my reflection, in case something looks back at me wrong. I put on my usual big on-air grin, even though my stomach kept tightening every time I remembered claws dragging across glass.

By the time I left the house, I had the routine pasted onto me like armor.

I slipped into my car. The seat felt colder than usual—like no one had sat in it for days. I started the engine and turned on my upbeat playlist, forcing myself to hum along. If I stopped humming, I was afraid I’d start listening for scratching again.

When I pulled into the station, Kim and Marty were arriving at the same time. I kicked myself into gear, jogging over with my usual enthusiasm and throwing an arm around each of their shoulders.

“Hey, guys! I hope you’re both ready to put on a great show today!”

Kim snorted. “One day, Bradley, you’re going to walk in here tired or grumpy, and I’m going to check your pulse.”

“Seriously,” Marty added. “Not a single bad mood in three years? I’m starting to think you’re a robot.”

I forced a laugh. “If I were a robot, I’d have more energy right now.”

Kim frowned. “You good? You look a little pale.”

“Just didn’t sleep great,” I said quickly. “Neighbors were loud.”

Kim opened her mouth like she wanted to ask more, but Marty clapped her on the back.

“Let the man suffer in peace. Come on.”

I kept smiling so hard my cheeks hurt.

Inside the studio, Kim immediately crouched by the soundboard, muttering to herself as she checked the levels.

“These inputs are all over the place again,” she groaned. “Did someone kick the mixer last night?”

Marty laughed. “If they did, it was justified. That thing has a personal vendetta against us.”

“Maybe it needs therapy,” I joked weakly.

Kim pointed at me without looking up. “Don’t tempt me. I will schedule a counseling session for this mixer.”

It helped. For a second, I felt almost normal.

I grabbed today’s script and skimmed through it.

Weather updates. Local cases. Community spotlight.

Totally normal. Wonderfully, blissfully normal.

Kim leaned over my shoulder. “You’ve got the charity segment today. You’re usually good at that stuff. People love your ‘local hero’ voice.”

“My what?”

“You know—soft tone, slight head tilt, eyes that say ‘I care deeply about your casserole fundraiser.’”

I laughed for real that time. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Sure you don’t,” she said, smirking.

Marty walked past us with a coffee cup the size of a small bucket. “Five bucks says he does the head tilt before the first commercial break.”

“Ten,” Kim shot back.

Their normal, easy banter wrapped around me like a blanket. I clung to it without letting them know how badly I needed it.

I stepped onto the set, cleared my throat, smoothed my tie, and let my on-air smile take over as the red tally light blinked on.

“Looks like today we’re gonna have a very sunny morning! Temperatures are gonna be a little higher, so make sure to drink plenty of water and have fun!”

As I spoke, the familiar rhythm settled over me. My voice. My pacing. The camera’s unblinking eye. Something inside me loosened, like I could finally breathe for the first time since last night.

Behind the camera, I saw Kim watching me with an amused smirk. She tapped her own head and mouthed, “The tilt!” Marty silently handed her ten dollars.

I almost smiled.

Then I heard it.

A faint sound above me. Soft. Familiar.

Scratch.

I froze mid-sentence. Kim’s brow furrowed; she glanced upward, then back at me, mouthing, “Is that feedback?”

Marty tapped the boom mic, frowning. “Something’s buzzing in the ceiling…”

They heard something. Not clearly. Not enough to understand.

Another whisper of nails dragging across metal.

Then—my name. Barely audible.

My stomach dropped.

Slowly, against every instinct screaming at me not to, I lifted my eyes toward the rafters. The studio lights washed everything in white, the edges blurring—but even then, I saw it.

It clung to the beams like a spider, its limbs bent wrong, too long, too loose. And its face—

Its face was mine.

My hair. My eyes. My forced, camera-ready smile. Except wrong. Timed a second off from my own expression, like an echo wearing skin.

Its mouth moved.

My exact voice whispered my name again.

Kim’s eyes widened. “Is someone up there?” she whispered.

Marty squinted into the lights. “I—I can’t see… is that a person?”

I tried to keep reading from the script, pretending everything was normal while my eyes darted between the teleprompter and the thing above me. It had begun inching closer, limbs folding and unfolding with deliberate hunger.

Then—

A blur behind it.

Vivienne.

She drove a knife into its back in one clean, practiced motion. The creature let out a chattering hiss—sharp and insectlike. It lashed back at her, claws scraping metal.

Kim shrieked. Marty stumbled into a light stand. Someone cut the feed—probably thinking equipment was falling or someone had gotten hurt up there.

I forced out, “I—uh—need to take a quick break! Be right back!” with the most cheerful anchor voice I could manage.

Then I bolted for the ladder.

At the top, the creature twisted its body around the knife, lunging at Vivienne. She barely dodged the next strike.

Something in me snapped.

I tackled it, and we slammed onto the metal grating.

It smiled—my smile—wide and hungry.

Then it tore into me.

Claws raked across my shoulders. Another stabbed into my ribs, sharp enough that the pain exploded white behind my eyes. I gasped, trying to shove it off, but it was stronger. Everything blurred, muffled. My heartbeat thudded slower and slower.

The thing lowered its face toward mine and whispered my name—

—and then everything went black.

When I finally clawed my way back to consciousness, Vivienne was steadying me. Behind her, the thing’s body lay twisted on the catwalk, its head a short distance away—still, unmoving.

I winced, pressing a hand to my side. Warm blood seeped through my fingers.

“Well… I’m assuming it won’t be messing with me—or anyone—anymore, right? Please tell me it can’t… come back.”

Vivienne didn’t smile. “No. Whatever that was… It’s done.” She hesitated. “But things like that don’t usually show up at random.”

That made my skin crawl.

Then she pressed the knife into my hand.

“Keep it,” she said quietly. “Please.”

My blood dripped onto the floor beneath us.

I didn’t know what was waiting for me after this.

I pulled in right around sunset, orange sky, waves crashing, the whole movie-scene vibe. I made dinner on my little camp stove (burned half the onions, nailed the other half, balance), and climbed into bed with that weird “holy crap, this is actually happening” feeling.

Then around 1 AM I heard scratching under the van. Not *around* the van. Under it. Google did not reassure me (“might be a bobcat,” THANKS INTERNET).

I picked myself up a diy Inductance and capacitance frequency meter soldering kit off of Ali.

After powering the board on again. It worked!

Tired, feels like walking through water, can't think straight, lazy vision, socialising feels extra hard to keep up with finding the right words or energy to speak.

My bloods are always good. I have a very very clean, healthy diet, but have some mystery IBS thing that flares up usually only if I eat red meat or high fat. I do have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I dont want to just blame one of these things when the cause could easily be something else, fixable. I mostly seem to sleep well, 7-9hrs, no coffee in the afternoons.

It's not like I'm always tired. I can't easily pinpoint something as cause and effect. But I cant put my life on pause every time I crash seemingly out of the blue!

I dont know where to start in terms of understanding this or fixing it. Please can someone point me in the right direction?",5,1763785259.0,cfs,4,1.0,False
