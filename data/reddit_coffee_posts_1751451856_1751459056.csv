1lpubd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketing/comments/1lpubd7/you_guys_told_me_to_try_freelance_writing_six/,"You guys told me to try freelance writing. Six months later, here's what happened...","Back in March, I posted about being laid off from my office job and struggling to find anything decent in my area. Rent was overdue, had maybe $200 in my account, and I was getting desperate. I mentioned I was always good at writing in school but never thought it could actually make money.

The response was incredible. So many of you pushed me to try freelance writing, shared resources, gave me websites to check out. I'll be honest I was skeptical. Seemed too good to be true. But I was also broke and running out of options.

Started with Upwork (I know, I know, everyone hates it). My first gig was a $15 blog post about pet grooming. Took me like 4 hours to write because I kept second-guessing everything. But the client loved it and left a great review.

Six months later? I'm averaging $3,200 a month. Not life changing money, but it's steady and growing. I've got three regular clients now who send me work weekly. One's a small law firm that needs blog content, another runs several e-commerce sites, and the third does newsletters for local businesses.

The game changer was specializing. Instead of writing about everything, I focused on small business marketing content. Turns out there's decent money in helping local shops figure out their online presence.

Best part? I'm writing this from a coffee shop at 2 PM on a Tuesday. No commute, no office politics, no asking permission to take a long lunch.

Not gonna lie it's not always smooth. Some clients disappear, payments get delayed, and imposter syndrome hits hard sometimes. But having control over my schedule and income? Worth the uncertainty.

To anyone in a similar spot: it's not a magic solution, but it's definitely possible. Start small, be consistent, and don't undersell yourself (still working on that last one).

1lpu4fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1lpu4fu/dear_i/,"Dear I,","There's something about silence that feels louder than words. Something about your absence that clings to my skin like perfume I never meant to wear this long. I don't know what this gut feeling is, but it's either that l'm being tragically delusional or I am somehow, inexplicably, right. Because there is no way I felt you across a screen, through pictures and posts, without something far more powerful threading us together. It has to be some past life recognition. How else do I explain this aching familiarity? How else do I explain that I'm behaving like a teenager in love? It's maddening. But it's also honest.

Still, it breaks my heart truly to see that you don't seem to feel that too. Or maybe I'm the first one between us who's awakened to it. Or maybe, just maybe, you feel it too, but are too afraid to say it out loud. I can't know for sure. But I remember clearly how shaken I felt the first time I saw your photo, the kind of pull I had toward you was instant, magnetic.
The kind where you don't need to talk to be heard.

In my 27 years of life, l've never felt that about anyone. It felt too random to be random. I found you online, but it felt like I was returning. As if fate herself opened a door I didn't know I was knocking on. And our first conversation? It flowed like we weren't strangers, it didn't feel like an introduction.
It felt like a reminder. A sacred reintroduction of souls that already knew each other in some far-off place.

So no, my love, I won't chase you. I won't insult whatever we have or had by begging for your attention. I realized I've already given you everything I could from my end. If this connection is truly as deep as I feel it is, then let it be known through stillness too. I don't want to rush things, especially when they're real. And if it's real, if it's mutual, then it should be obvious. Love shouldn't have to chase love. The kind of connection that is meant doesn't run. This is how I'll know too; if this was ever mutual, or if I was simply alone in it.

Still, in my mind, I see the future with you. I paint entire days with you in them. Lazy Sunday mornings in bed, wrapped in blankets and sunlight reading your favorite sally rooney, I see you with your cup of coffee and me beside you with my tea. When I was younger, I used to joke, ""My lover needs to be a hot tea lover too."" I said I couldn't fall for someone who didn't share that quirk. But then I met you. And I discovered you love coffee and iced tea of course.
You never told me this but it was obvious from your posts.
And somehow, in that small, delicate
detail, I fell in love with the exception. You. I fell in love with my own duality and suddenly I was attracted to how our choices were completely opposite. What can I say, love makes you that way. 

We've done the hard part of finding each other, somehow, in a world of 8 billion people. The odds were already impossible. Now let's do the easy part: not letting go. Let's not turn our backs on something this rare. Don't run from me, please, not when I am standing here, offering not just love, but gentleness. I only know how to love you gently.

Don't ignore me, please. Don't keep my messages on ""delivered"". it cuts deeper than you know. It breaks my heart daily, the way you disappear without saying goodbye. I want to know so badly how your day went. I want to hear all the silly, mundane things that made you smile or frown.
Please don't haunt me like this with your silence.

If you must leave, let it be loud. Let it be final. But don't pretend like we were never a possibility. Don't turn our connection into a memory I have to mistrust. Let me love you, or let me grieve you. But don't let me hang somewhere in between.

Always,

You know who or I hope you do.üíåüíå",2,1751458019.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.75,False

Change organizer - Many tips recommend a change purse, but I think the plastic change organizer is far superior.  Available at Daiso or most 100 yen shops.  I never had more than 5 of any coin and left with only 4 yen.  

Tax-free shopping - I didn't think I would do much shopping so didn't have a strategy.  Bundle purchases to make sure you're hitting the tax-free threshold.  The most common touristy items (Biore, kitkats, skin care, etc) are the same everywhere and I didn't see much variation in price.  Make your list and shop at the end of your trip.  The other things is that not all stores (even of the same brand) are tax-free.  For example, not all Mont Bell stores are tax-free. If you're making some big purchases, it's worth researching which locations are. Finally, even if you don't think you're a shopper, you'll get sucked in.  :)  And of course, not everything is unique or cheaper than your home country.  Example, uniqlo some items were 50% less.  Others were the same.  Save that luggage space for items that you can't get back home or where there's big savings.  

Early risers who drink coffee - Pack or pick up some instant coffee.  Kettles will be available everywhere, but the availability of coffee was limited.  That said there's some very nice pour over bags to be found or Blendy stick at most grocery stores.  This is especially key if you're staying outside cities or where there isn't easy access to konbinis.  

Cold drinks - In general, I found vending machines to more reliably have colder drinks than convenience stores.  Key on the hot, humid days.  

Payke app - Only discovered this mid way through my trip via an instagram ad.  Free and better at translating product labels than google translate.  Especially useful if you're shopping for health/beauty products or want to check food labels for allergies or dietary restrictions.  

Picking up train tickets for an online purchase - This may be specific to Haruka Express (from Kyoto to Osaka airport), but give yourself plenty of time.  You need to go to a machine with a passport scanner (which is not all of them)  to verify the discounted fare or see a manned agent.",2,1751457487.0,JapanTravelTips,1,1.0,False

Of course, it wasn't very obvious at the time. In fact, the entire conversation we had didn't have a single mention of religion or culture whatsoever. But a Japanese lady approaching me, a foreigner, out of nowhere to say that my hair is cool? (It was, of course, but still.) It was pretty sus, to say the least.

The alarm bells were ringing, but honestly I was too tired to do anything else. She asked for cafe recommendations in the area, I gave her the one with awful coffee. She invited me to go to said cafe sometime, I said my schedule's pretty packed now. So, we exchanged LINEs. She also, unfortunately took a photo with me. Stupid, I know (angry comments incoming), but I just came from a really tiring work day and just... kinda went on autopilot. After parting ways with her, I only confirmed her involvement with a cult after sending a friend her IG account that she had displayed on her LINE profile.

And it's only now sinking in that a stranger has a photo of me and I don't know if I should be terrified or just let it slide.

Everyone in our families swore by Costco and the one down the street from our house was always packed, no matter the time or day. It's nice they had a gas station whereas the closest BJ's with a gas station is about a 25+ minute drive from our home.

The perks are great and the product they have is top-notch. Membership practically pays for itself quickly because they included a $50 e-card. I also applied and got the Citi card so we're getting 4% cash back on our groceries and 5% on gas. 

However, I'm pretty disappointed about the grocery selection. There are a number of items we purchase frequently that are not sold at our warehouse:

* Lactaid whole milk (only 2% is available)
* my baby daughter's brand of milk 
* Chips Ahoy
* Any male deodorant w/o aluminum (they only had one brand)
* Any flavored oatmilk
* Bagged coffee grounds
* Starbucks iced coffee
* Tyson chicken nuggets (this one blew my mind)
* Cesar dog food

I'm probably going to restart our BJ's membership because we're picking these items up at grocery stores but the smaller quantities necessitate more trips and it gets pricier.

I tried nasal breathing. Apparently it‚Äôs better for oxygen efficiency, focus, all that. But I couldn‚Äôt do it. My nose felt blocked, like trying to suck air through a coffee stirrer. I‚Äôd give up and go back to mouth breathing.

Tried taping my mouth shut. Tried those snore strips from the pharmacy. Helped a little, but they were clearly made for sleeping, not sweating through a 15k trail in wind and rain.

At some point, I just got fed up. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking, why doesn‚Äôt anyone make nasal strips for runners? Something that stays on, opens the nose properly, and holds up when you‚Äôre actually moving.

So I decided to make one myself.

I started messing with prototypes: different shapes, adhesives, materials. It was brutal. I burned through so many versions I lost count. Some wouldn‚Äôt stick. Others stuck too hard and tore skin. One batch literally melted off when a tester ran in heat. Had people testing them in races, mountains, rain, everything. Constant feedback. Constant failure.

Eventually, we got it right.

Now I can finally breathe through my nose on long runs. No dry mouth. No gasping. It just feels clean. Like my face unlocked. And I‚Äôm not alone, every serious runner we gave it to said the same thing. You feel it on the first breath.

We called it O2Stamina. It‚Äôs made in the Netherlands, designed only for athletes. No gimmicks, just a strip that works.

Not here to push anything. Just proud we made something real.

Can send out a couple if someone wants to test it on a race. Just reply or DM, always down to hear how it holds up in the real world.",0,1751457129.0,RunningCirclejerk,6,0.25,False

I don't know what im asking. I don't know what to title this post. I don't really know what I'm doing here. I don't really know what I expect to gain for that matter.  But mostly I don't know what I'm doing out here, instead of being in there with her.

The only thing I know right now, I Love my Mother.

An as I like for my posts to be clear, concise and understandable to most anyone, I shouldn't be here typing yet.

Honestly I just discovered this sub less than 5 minutes ago, And my time would probably be much better spent reading than typing. No one might ever read this I'll probably just hit discard.

Yeah this one's gonna get long, an I'd better start making sense soon. I've gotta nutshell this somehow,  That shouldn't be hard this isn't an original story after all. Ok,

My mother's been on hospice care since early February, and she just doesn't eat. Not that that's what put us here. Was a combination of early stage lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and frequent hospitalizations.

But no It's her complete inability to ingest food anymore it's gonna be her end. 

She just can't eat, She has a strong appetite. Tells me what she'd like for dinner and I'll either prepare it myself or order it from out. But as soon as I put the food in front of her, her stomach turns the smells an everything just turn her off and she can't eat.

I get nibbles, bites,  I can't remember the last time she eat even half a plate of food. All I do is throw away rotten leftovers She's been sustained this long off of tapioca pudding & half an ensure a day. To be perfectly honest I'm not sure how she's made it this long.

Me real quick, I only signed up to be her POA originally.  But hospice came, It was time to find a care giver. And as I found myself in a transitionary period in life and was unemployed anyway. I couldn't think of anyone better than myself. Only I had no idea what I was getting myself into. This just started wearing on me a lot faster than I thought it would.

Stop. Honestly my only real gripe in this entire situation. I really wish someone had have told me about the classes that were available to me back when I had the time to take them anyway. 

I can't explain. it's a special kind of (insert your choice expletive here) that the first diaper I ever change is on my mother. I never had kids.

Okay enough background, Gonna skip to today, Well yesterday morning I guess.(IDK it's been one long fu*kin day for me now.) Gonna hurry up and get to the end the sun's coming up again.

She woke up in a tremendous amount of pain. On a level that we haven't reached before. (Idk if I'm even allowed to talk about drugs, don't care gonna continue) I gave her a full dose(as prescribed) of morphine and her dose of a lorazepam, Both liquid (0.5 ml each). It took longer than I would have liked for her to finally pass out asleep.  She's this bad so I'm decided to stay up make sure she's okay through the night.

If I'm honest her cries of pain we're affecting me more than I realized. Now it's eerily quiet.  She could have had another dose hours ago.

Okay. Here goes, Probably the only part of this cluster worth reading.

How do I put this, I think it happened. I was just making another cup of coffee and then I went to check on her and...

Her eyes are wide open, and I don't think her chest is moving. And instead of being a Man and checking for a pulse. I came out here, pulled out my phone with a thought. Sure enough I was right there's a sub for everything so I just started typing.

I've been out here for a while now, Too long In fact. This post has also grown too long.

 Just. I love you Mom.

An I've done my best. I only hope my best was good enough. I miss you so much already. I don't think my hearts ever gonna be the same.

Well here goes I've got a man up. Go see if what I believe to be true is true. Oh ya lastly,

To any Nurse out there. I thank you for what you do. I don't even know you, but I thank you, for helping anyone in my situation in their time of need. To the rest of you I simply thank you for reading.

I think im almost done crying. I have to stop for now, gotta man up soon.

TL-DR: Honestly I can't stand people like you. Learn to read you might actually grow as a person. Now why don't u go back up there an give it a try. I honesty pity people like you. Oh an to the Mods I don't really care what you do with this post.

Now. With all that said, I'm ready to go back in there... ",10,1751456279.0,hospice,2,1.0,False

 Going on vacation soon and looking to provide my fellow travelers with delicious coffee!

Going to take my Comandante C40 with me, but as my normal travel setup with the Aeropress will not be sufficient, I am wanting a pourover solution.

V60+Drip Assist --> Easy solution, around ‚Ç¨20, no gooseneck kettle needed   
Switch+Mugen --> around ‚Ç¨40, bloom with the Valve closed, then being able to pour bigger pours with a normal kettle (at least I think so?)  
  
I wanted to buy a switch for a while, so maybe this could be now my chance. What do you think? As I already have this V60 with decanter combination from Hario, another V60 would be redundant and wouldn't satisfy my wish to get a switch, but to be honest, the switch would also be just for playing around.

All he did was send a simple email a 6th grader could write.

120 people replied.

When someone replied, he'd ask a couple follow-up questions in the DMs.

If you can text your friend about dinner plans, you can do this. Those conversations gave him everything he needed for his sales campaign.

And because David's a smart cookie, He didn't even handle those DMs himself. He found someone else to do it. The campaign generated $130K total revenue. David's cut was somewhere between 20-40%.

I'm no math major, But even on the low end, I think that could put a few extra nickels in your rainy day fund.

[Rare earth magnet users jolted into paying premium prices for ex-China supply](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rare-earth-magnet-users-jolted-103239589.html?guccounter=1)

**By Eric Onstad and Hyunjoo Jin**

[Rare earth magnet users jolted into paying premium prices for ex-China supply, A view of pressers and furnaces used to make rare earth permanent magnets at the Neo Performance Materials factory, in Narva](https://preview.redd.it/yhh75imgpfaf1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=635082b14358716570b62ebaf7538bac5645d227)

**LONDON/SEOUL (Reuters)** \-For years, Rahim Suleman had reached out repeatedly to automakers and other potential clients to market the rare earth magnets from the plant his company was building in Estonia, one of just a handful outside dominant producer China.

But after April 4, when Beijing imposed new restrictions on the super-strong magnets used in electric vehicles and wind turbines, Suleman retired his sales pitch. He didn't need it any more.

Ever since China's export controls tightened some rare earth exports to a trickle in the midst of a trade war with the U.S., causing chaos in supply chains and some auto plant shutdowns, ""the phone is ringing off the hook"", said Suleman.

Companies starting new plants in Europe, the U.S. and Asia had previously reported difficult talks on deals that embedded the higher costs to make magnets outside China, which benefits from cheaper labor costs and economies of scale as well as government support via tax refunds.

But the crisis has led many customers to soften or drop objections about paying those premiums as they scramble to hammer out deals, according to a dozen industry participants including automakers, magnet makers, rare earth producers, consultants and government officials interviewed by Reuters.

While rare earths magnets from China are beginning to flow again, customers remain on edge about the threat of future shortages.

S**uleman's company, Neo Performance Materials, launched output of permanent magnets at its Estonia plant in May. Now, he said, ""everybody wants to talk about how (they can) satisfy their demand out of our facility"".**

[NioCorp's \~Terbium, Dysprosium, & Neodymium-Praseodymium oxide \(NdPr\) will form a part of the Magnetic Rare Earths solution! Also called out in the 2024 NDAA\*\*](https://reddit.com/link/1lptgxe/video/nbqbjafa1gaf1/player)

He said he has no worries about lining up enough customers who will pay a premium - $10 to $30 per kg, with EVs typically holding 2-4 kg of magnets per vehicle - over the price they usually pay for Chinese magnets.

Output at Neo's factory in Estonia is starting small, providing samples to its first customer, which Suleman declined to identify. German auto parts supplier Schaeffler told Reuters it is a customer of the plant, but declined to comment on how much it is paying.

In Korea, customers of NovaTech, which produces magnets in China, are prepared to pay 15% to 20% more for magnets made in Vietnam, a company source told Reuters, adding there was ""a growing sense of crisis among customers"".

The company, which sells China-made magnets used in Samsung's phones and tablets, is investing at least 10 billion won ($7.39 million) in a plant in Vietnam launching early next year to make magnets using locally processed rare earths from a partner, the person and another company official told Reuters.

Britain's Less Common Metals, one of the few firms outside China involved in a key step of rare earths processing - making rare earth metals and alloys - says it is battling to cope with new enquiries.

""Now, post-April 4, it's like someone stuck a cattle prod into the whole industry,"" said Grant Smith, its majority owner and chairman.

He said LCM has held discussions with numerous companies that use magnets as they seek alternative supply sources, though he declined to name them. The firm now has plans to expand into France and other countries.

# A FINE BALANCE

Despite the new willingness to pay a premium, it will take many years or even decades to build up production outside of China, which accounts for 90% of global permanent magnet supply, industry participants said.

And the question of how much more should be paid for rare earths and magnets outside of China is a tricky one.

Too high a premium for mined rare earths could see consumers cutting down their use, while premiums that are too low would not be enough to allow for construction of ex-China projects, analysts and consultants say.

Automakers are willing to pay more to guarantee ex-China supplies, but they are also in the midst of an EV price war that has left them with razor-thin margins, and will still be queasy at what they regard as excessive premiums, according to industry participants.

One executive at a rare earths company said their firm has held discussions with automakers that are prepared to pay $80 per kg for neodymium-praseodymium oxide (NdPr), a rare earth needed for magnets used in motors and generators - a figure Reuters has not independently verified.

That is already a significant - near 30% - premium over the Chinese price of $62 based on data from price reporting agency Fastmarkets.

""The purchasing departments have it in their DNA to save each cent or fraction of a cent, but things are changing,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media.

""They‚Äôre realizing they're losing more by having to close a plant for a month than paying a premium to guarantee supplies.‚Äù

Critical minerals consultancy Project Blue says that for NdPr, a price of $75 to $105 per kg is needed to support enough production to meet demand.

Australia's Barrenjoey goes further, saying NdPr prices need to be $120 to $180 per kg to fund a substantial wave of production that would encompass around 20 global mining projects.

One executive at a European automaker said his industry could not afford to pay excessive premiums. His company has agreed deals for other critical minerals at a 5% to 10% premium, based on certification they are produced sustainably, he said.

His company sold cars globally, he said, and could not make a profit if it had to pay a high premium for all the raw materials produced outside of China.

Some automakers, such as BMW, have developed EVs that do not use rare earths, while others have reduced the amount of rare earths in their vehicles. However, getting rid of rare earths is not feasible in the medium term, analysts say.

Neo's Suleman said everyone in the industry had to work together to create a supply of rare earths outside China.

""I don't think that we're looking at this and saying the floodgates are open, let's just charge whatever we want, we need to be responsible,"" he said.

""Customers understand there is a premium that is required, but if that premium gets too big, we're looking at demand destruction.""

The¬†[United States](https://www.dw.com/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)¬†along with¬†[Japan](https://www.dw.com/en/japan/t-19035046),¬†[India](https://www.dw.com/en/india/t-18996071)¬†and¬†[Australia](https://www.dw.com/en/australia/t-18172340)¬†announced a critical minerals initiative on Tuesday amid concerns over¬†[China's](https://www.dw.com/en/china/t-18480887)¬†dominance in the field.

The group of four, also known as the ""Quad,"" pledged to work towards a stable supply of¬†[minerals that are necessary for new technologies](https://www.dw.com/en/how-china-wields-rare-earths-as-a-strategic-weapon/a-72868760).

""Reliance on any one country for processing and refining critical¬†[minerals](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-what-are-the-benefits-of-the-minerals-deal-with-the-us/a-72421807)¬†and derivative goods production exposes our industries to economic coercion, price manipulation and supply chain disruptions,"" a joint statement by the group said.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met his counterparts in Washington, DC, despite ties between the Quad nations and US being strained due to President¬†[Donald Trump's](https://www.dw.com/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)¬†[tariffs](https://www.dw.com/en/trump-tariffs/t-71496505)¬†and other policies.¬†

In his opening remarks, Rubio called the other nations¬†[important strategic partners](https://www.dw.com/en/quad-foreign-ministers-decry-south-china-sea-militarization/a-69792784)¬†and said it was time to ""deliver action"" on specific issues.

In attendance were Australia's Penny Wong, India's Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japan's Takeshi Iwaya.

""Today‚Äôs gathering will strengthen strategic stability in the Indo - Pacific and keep it free and open,"" Jaishankar posted on X.

# What did the Quad members discuss

Few details of the initiative were shared and Beijing was not called out by name, but the goal was clearly to reduce reliance on China for minerals, which are crucial in semiconductors and other technologies.¬†

The joint statement expressed concern over aggressive activities in the South China Sea and East China Sea that ""threaten peace and stability in the region.""

In comments made after the meeting, Rubio said he was focused on diversifying supply chains and wanted ""real progress.""

The Quad group was first conceived as a group of democracies to contain China's influence.¬†

They last met in January, soon after the inauguration of Trump's second term as president. However, defying expectations of many, China has not been a priority for this US administration.

Trump is expected to travel to India for a Quad meeting later this year.

The group condemned the Pahalgam attack in India and North Korea's nuclear launches.

Though they have a common focus regarding China, the Quad members differ on several other issues, such as the wars in¬†[Ukraine](https://www.dw.com/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789)¬†and the¬†[Middle East](https://www.dw.com/en/israel-and-the-crisis-in-the-middle-east/t-57547294).¬†

Rubio also said about 30 or 40 companies from Quad countries were to meet on Tuesday to discuss cooperation and diversification of the supply chain for critical minerals.

# JULY 1st, 2025~A US framework for assessing risk in critical mineral supply chains

[A US framework for assessing risk in critical mineral supply chains - Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/a-us-framework-for-assessing-risk-in-critical-mineral-supply-chains/)

https://preview.redd.it/ly1ar9zmqfaf1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee2efc193ef063a0deb86fd5174efc153f493c60

Minerals and metals are foundational to modern technology‚Äîfrom smartphones and solar panels to satellites and semiconductors. Critical minerals include high-volume commodities like nickel and copper, niche elements such as tungsten and indium, and rare earths vital for magnets and alloys. These materials move through complex global supply chains, shaped by private and public-sector actors responding to market forces, profit incentives, and national security concerns.

The United States increasingly relies on these materials but cannot meet all its mineral needs domestically. This dependency creates strategic vulnerabilities, especially as global supply chains are often dominated by China. China controls much of the midstream processing, invests heavily in mining abroad, and owns key transshipment infrastructure. As US-China relations grow more competitive, mineral dependency becomes a critical leverage point.

To mitigate these risks, the United States must identify and address its most significant supply chain vulnerabilities. Building new mines, processing infrastructure, and manufacturing capacity requires substantial time and investment. Secure and resilient supply chains will also depend on partnerships with trusted international allies‚Äîan increasingly challenging task in today‚Äôs fractured trade environment. Geopolitical tension, extreme weather, and choke-point disruptions pose ongoing risks.

Effective supply chains must meet three criteria: adequate and affordable supply, resilience against shocks, and minimal reliance on adversaries. While the United States has identified critical minerals, each differs in supply chain complexity, substitutes, and risks. Understanding these nuances is vital for smart policy, reliable partnerships, and sustainable investment. This brief explores minerals with dual economic and national security uses and proposes principles to assess and address supply chain risks.

# JULY 2nd, 2025~Ramaco says Brook rare earth project viable with $1.2bn NPV ‚Äì Fluor report

https://preview.redd.it/yl1uix8jrfaf1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=732f67589388368a7f674ee3a730be102cd1fde8

[Ramaco says Brook rare earth project viable with $1.2bn NPV ‚Äì Fluor report](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/ramaco-says-brook-rare-earth-project-viable-with-12bn-npv-fluor-report-2025-07-02)

asdaq-listed Ramaco¬†[Resources](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/resources)¬†said on Tuesday that a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) by¬†[Fluor](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/fluor)¬†had found its Brook mine¬†[project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project)¬†to be commercially and technologically feasible, with a potential pre-tax net present value (NPV) of up to $1.2-billion.

The Wyoming-based Brook mine is believed to host the largest unconventional US deposit of rare earth elements (REEs) and critical minerals derived from¬†[coal](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/coal)¬†and carbonaceous ore. The full¬†[Fluor](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/fluor)¬†PEA is expected by July 8, the company said in a ‚ÄúThis report marks an important milestone in Ramaco's transition to become both a rare earth and critical mineral, as well as metallurgical¬†[coal](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/coal)¬†producer,‚Äù said Ramaco chairperson and CEO¬†**Randall**¬†**Atkins**. ‚ÄúThe development of our Brook mine deposit is important not only to Ramaco, but also to our country.‚Äù

The PEA outlines a pre-tax NPV, using an 8% discount, of $1.197-billion and NPV, using a 10% discount, of $898-million, based on a projected initial capital cost of $473-million, excluding a 22% contingency. The mine‚Äôs internal rate of return (IRR) is estimated at 38%, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $134-million a year by 2028, growing to $143-million in 2029 on revenue of $378-million.statement and separate shareholder letter.

[Fluor](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/fluor)'s findings follow earlier bench-scale tests that showed average REE leach extractions of about 90% for both light and heavy rare earths, with overall recoveries for critical minerals in the mid-80% range.

‚ÄúAt steady state, 1 242 annual short tons of oxide are projected to be produced, which include 456 t of gallium, germanium, scandium, terbium, dysprosium, neodymium, and praseodymium,‚Äù Ramaco said. The company also highlighted the deposit‚Äôs scalability and 42-year initial mine life, which would tap less than 4% of the total mineral inventory.

‚ÄúWhen we are in production, the Brook mine will be one of only two domestic sources of rare earth elements. However, it will be the only domestic source of both heavy rare earth elements and critical minerals that are vital to our nation's¬†[defence](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/defence)¬†industry,"" added Atkins.

‚ÄúBased on just the magnet rare earth oxides projected to be produced at current levels, we believe the Brook mine would support 3% to 5% of total United States permanent magnet demand or more than 30% of the demand for US¬†[defence](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/defence)¬†applications,‚Äù Atkins said.

Unlike traditional hard-rock REE sources, the Brook mine‚Äôs softer geological profile is expected to allow for more efficient extraction and lower capital intensity. The flowsheet includes conventional¬†[crushing](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/crushing), multi-stage liberation, purification, separation and calcination‚Äîparts of which involve proprietary IP, the company said.

Ramaco has already started¬†[mining](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/mining)¬†to procure ore for pilot-scale¬†[testing](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/testing), with an on-site pilot plant slated for the fourth quarter of 2025 and commercial¬†[testing](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/testing)¬†by mid-2026.

**‚ÄúThis will be America‚Äôs rare earth mine,‚Äù Atkins said. ‚ÄúChina may now be dominating these critical materials. But this will be America‚Äôs rare earth mine.‚Äù**¬†

1lptgw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1lptgw9/please_offer_some_insight_on_this_situation/,Please offer some insight on this situation...,"Hey askgaybros. I had a little situation with someone who left me kind of puzzled and I need some guidance. 

I've been seeing someone for about a month and some change now. Nothing crazy, but still time. In the beginning we spent a lot of time together. I understand this can create an unhealthy attachment and I believe it might have. 

Now, I haven't dated around in about 3 years. After my last relationship I took some time and it wasn't until I was deep in my singleness that I realized that I had things to work on, so I did. 

When this guy and I first started hanging out I noticed that his humor is kind of rooted in meanness. A lot of these ""jokes"" were not very funny to me, especially if I was the butt of the joke or the joke was just taking jabs at me. It didn't even feel like a joke, it just kind of felt like poking. I've always been sensitive and I recognize that about myself, so I always pushed past it because I thought that's just me being soft or insecure. I did speak up a couple of times and his response was ""that's how I am with everyone"", essentially, explaining that that's his humor. But I've been vocal in asking for like a little more kindness. 

The comments would always vary, but I always felt slighted by them. They just feel like little jabs. 

Today we met up to get some food and the vibes were weird. I really do like him, but I've been thinking about this ""relationship"" for a while now because I don't think it feels correct. Like, I want a partner who takes the time to show me they like me and enjoys spending time with me. 

One of our first interactions today was him shushing me while I was singing a song (but as a joke, of course). After we left he made a comment about how long I took to meet him and about the fact that I stayed 30 minutes extra at work. (Mind you... On one of our first dates he was running late and I made sure to tell him to not worry about it, that I can wait because, in all honesty, I really didn't mind it and I hate rushing people. Especially if they're already rushing themselves). 

During the conversation he made a comment that I just wasn't that funny, but I forgot the context by this point. I tried to ""match his mean"" and had to physically stop myself and said ""hey, actually, I don't want to be mean to you, I can't go down to that level"".

Then, while we were talking about the past pride weekend, the conversation turned to this weird back and forth about how much it takes for me to get tipsy and if I'm a lightweight or not. I got my friend and I shots over the weekend at a bar and that shot nearly took us out, it was the heaviest pour of a shot I've ever seen and for some reason he wouldn't accept that as an answer? I feel like I'm having a fever dream typing this out. 

At this point (and, in hindsight, what I should've done) I wanted to just turn around and go home. I haven't seen this man in a week and I was so excited to spend time with him and that excitement died nearly immediately. 

He asked what they poured the shot in and I said ""a glass..?"", to which he responded with ""oh wow, a glass"". I felt super cornered, it almost felt like I was a bullied child where nothing I was saying was landing, nothing I was saying was working so I said ""yes, a glass, a fucking glass. What else do you put liquor in?"".

Now the tone was definitely pointed, you could tell there was emotion in it. He said I yelled at him, so out of respect for other's feelings and perceptions I'm not going to negate it. He got upset and started walking ahead of me. 

I felt like a kid walking after my mom after she would get mad at me, it was a nasty feeling for sure. I asked him ""why would you try to push me to a place where I have to defend myself"", he said ""I don't know, answer that yourself, I can't make justifications for your behavior"". 

After a few minutes I said ""hey.. I was at work all day, you were at work today (implying both of us have had long days), the weather is beautiful. None of us should be spending our night like this."" He said that he agreed and after a while turned around and said ""what I think I'm going to do is go get take out and some coffee and go home"".

I said okay and left. 

As of now we've agreed to get some space. There was a short text exchange where I said I felt kind of confused and lost. His response was that the situation was draining for him and he asked for space, which I'm happy to provide for both of our's sake. 

This entire ""relationship"" has been pretty up-and-down, but I've been thinking about (no joke) making this Reddit post for at least a week or two now and I just need some opinions. I really dislike the fact that I allowed someone to get an emotional rise out of me, I think that's the part I dislike the most. 

I don't think this man likes me, or maybe at least not as much as I like him, and I had a reaction of, basically, ""I've had it"".

Once training is over I'll get too bored and just walk out. This has caused my resume to be a lie. I've only held one job for more than a year and I was working as a dietary aide in a nursing home. I started my first job at Wendy's, went to work for the nursing home after 3 or so Months. I really loved working there but new management came and they didn't like me and how I loved to work a lot. I went to work with my mom at 18 after that to work for a raw meat packing plant and I think that's when it all went downhill. I got into a huge fight with my mom because she said I didn't have the drive to work with her there. That was the year 2022. I ended up not working for quite a while then I finally ""secured"" a job working seasonaly for a greenhouse. Then the season ended and I got a amazing opportunity to work as a housekeeper/kitchen assistant in NY state. I had to leave because I was sharing a cabin with my coworkers and one of them yet again had an issue with me. So I come back sit on my ass and game for a month. I then got a job as a pruner for a plant nursery only lasted a week because I wasn't fast enough. Then I went to Walmart for a few months, again didn't last long enough because of management. Then I went to hy vee again didn't last long enough due to management. Which puts us around the end of 2023 when I lost the hy vee job. I didn't work for the better part of 2024, I finally got a job working as a overnight batcher for a coffee company where I met my boyfriend. Long story shortend I lost that job cause I couldn't bare the memories of him as he had left the job. 
I ended up moving in with him, he's prior military so he went down to Florida around Oct of 2024 to get schooling for telecommunications. I endeded up getting a seasonal job yet again working for footlocker packing shoeboxes. It lasted from beginning of October to beg of December. It was supposed to last and I was supposed to stay full time but they let me go cause I would full on cry at work due to my boyfriend having mental health issues and dumping it on me. Fast forward a few months, we both don't work for the better part of December, January. Then he starts his telecommunications job in February he worked there until beginning of April cause we both had the bright idea of moving cross country from Kansas to North Carolina where he's from. Now in north Carolina you'd think fresh start right? Nope. I got a job at a BBQ place but they payed minimum wage so that was a nope. Then I got a job as a sales woman asking for donations to save local animals from kill shelters. Didn't last long at that place though because the truck we had used to drive from Kansas to North Carolina barely made it cross country due to the back end going out and a failing transmission. Then my boyfriend secured a job building trusses for a housing manufacturer, didn't last long though the job was too rough on him. Unfortunately we had ended up moving into an apartment between when he got the job and when he left the job so yet again I was forced to get a job quickly. I ended up securing a retail job then later in the month of June working for a insulation place that I lost because we lost the apartment due to a dispute with our downstairs neighbors and the job then became to far for me to get to. Fast forward to now the end of June beginning of July my boyfriend secured a great job. We're currently living with his parents and waiting to save up enough money to get a trailer because we're tired of apartments after the dispute with the neighbors. I feel really guilty for not working because living at his parents is hell and it's ruining my mental health being forced to sit around at his parents doing nothing while he works his ass off. I had gotten the point of having bad breakdowns worse than I've had years prior. Panic attacks, hitting and biting myself. My boyfriend unfortunately had to witness both of them and he does think I'm crazy but he said that he is looking past it and for me to learn from my mistakes and better myself. 
Before we had lost the apartment I almost left him and flew back to Kansas to live with my brother because I could feel the ship sinking. I cant now however due to the neighbors bringing me to court in August. I've been trying to get jobs but everything that has happened has left me so rattled mentally that I have heavy brain foithat makes it hard to focus especially during phone interviews I fumble on my words and lie which I've never done in the past.

When I expressed my dissatisfaction, he actually let his little childhood sweetheart move into the new home we had prepared for after our marriage.

He even had the audacity to tell me: ""It's your fault for being petty and not letting me drive Autumn to and from work. Her foot injury hasn't healed, and I don't want her walking such a long distance.""

""Our new place happens to be close to her company. We're not living there yet anyway, so it might as well be used.""

Even on the very day we were supposed to get our marriage license, he stood me up completely.

""Autumn sneezed twice this morning. I'm worried, so I'm taking her to the hospital. Getting the marriage certificate isn't urgent‚Äîwe can reschedule for another day.""

Huh, reschedule my ass!

I immediately called my childhood friend:

""Nate Sullivan, want to get married with me? If yes, get your butt over here right now!""

...

I waited at the intersection for half an hour with no sign of my fianc√©'s car.

Usually by this time, he would have already parked and be waiting to drive me to work.

For three years, rain or shine, he'd never missed a day.

When my 20th call finally went through, a woman's voice answered.

""Hey, Rayna, Logan can't talk right now‚Äîhe's driving.""

""I'm Autumn. I twisted my ankle this morning. Logan was worried and offered to drive me to work.""

""Put him on the phone,"" I demanded.

""Logan Harper! You couldn't bother to call and tell me you were picking up Autumn? Do you have any idea how worried I was?""

""It was an emergency and I was in a rush‚Äîcompletely forgot about you. By the way, I won't be able to drive you to and from work anymore.""

""Autumn hurt her ankle, so I need to drive her. That's all. Gotta go.""

My blood was boiling.

This Autumn was the ultimate queen of manipulation, and of course, men just ate it up.

So, I had to take a taxi to work, making me two hours late.

My boss‚Äîwho also happens to be my childhood friend‚Äîcalled me into his office.

""What happened today? You're seriously late.""

""Don't even get me started. Logan ran off to pick up Autumn without telling me. I wasted time waiting for him, then went to his place looking for him. The whole thing was a wild goose chase.""

""What a jerk! Just Dump him and marry me instead!""

I rolled my eyes. ""Give me a break. I still remember you in diapers.""

Just then, my phone pinged with a message from Autumn.

\[Sorry, Rayna! Did you get in trouble with your boss for being late? I told Logan he didn't need to drive me, but he insisted. You don't mind, do you?\]

I replied: \[Thanks for your concern, but I'm the boss's favorite‚ÄîI'm the one who scolds him, not the other way around.\]

\[And FYI, I'm three years younger than you, so I should be calling YOU 'sis.' Also, I absolutely DO mind Logan driving you every day, so take a taxi from now on.\]

That felt so‚Äîgood.

Autumn quickly replied: \[Sorry, judging by your appearance, I thought you were older.\]

\[I told Logan I'd take a taxi, but he wouldn't listen. Maybe you should talk to him yourself.\]

Chapter 2

I showed my phone to Nate. ""See this? She's saying I look old!""

""Says the thirty-something who dresses in Lolita fashion trying to look young.""

Then Autumn posted on Facebook: \[My personal chauffeur's passenger seat\~\]

The photo showed her in the passenger seat of my car, head tilted to one side, with Logan's shoulder visible beside her.

Fuming, I called Logan.

""Finished escorting your precious Autumn? Meet me at the coffee shop below my office. We need to talk.""

Half an hour later, I faced Logan across the table.

""What's so important it couldn't be said over the phone?""

""How long are you planning to chauffeur Autumn around?""

""Sprains take time to heal‚Äîat least three months, I'd say.""

""Fine. Then give me back my car. I'll drive myself to work.""

The car Logan drove was actually mine.

When he first saw my Mercedes, he was practically drooling, saying he'd never driven such a nice car and wanted to try it.

Eventually, he just took over, appointing himself my personal driver, and I let him keep it.

""What am I supposed to drive if I give it back?""

""That car was a gift from my father so I could get to work easily. Now that you're not driving me anymore, I want it back. Any problem with that?""

""Can't you just take a taxi? You know I need to drive Autumn to work. When did you become so petty, Rayna?""

""Autumn's like a young sister to me. She's injured‚Äîshouldn't I help her?""

""Last I checked, you're an only child. When did you suddenly get a sister, Logan?""

""And why can't Autumn take a taxi? Besides, you're about to get married. Do you think it's appropriate to use your fianc√©e's car to chauffeur another woman around every day?""

I didn't want to waste any more words. I simply held out my hand:

""Keys. Now.""

Logan scowled for a long moment before finally saying, ""Fine, I won't drive her anymore. I didn't think this through. Happy now?""

""That's more like it.""

As the workday was ending, Logan called.

""Can't pick you up tonight. Helping a friend move.""

""Whatever. Just don't be late tomorrow morning.""

After hanging up, I noticed Nate leaning against my desk, watching me.

""What?""

""Want to bet your fianc√© is making excuses to pick up his little damsel in distress?""

""No way. When he makes a promise, he keeps it.""

""You're that sure? What if he's taken her to his place to look after her?""

""That's even more ridiculous! What kind of person do you think he is?""

Despite my confident words, doubt crept in.

So that night, I video-called Logan:

""Are you alone?""

""Of course. Who else would be here?""

""Show me around your apartment. I want to see.""

""What, you think I'm hiding someone?""

Logan panned his phone around his rental apartment‚ÄîNo one else was there.

I finally relaxed.",1,1751455908.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Spanish clarinet player pulls in $130k in email sales...

Jason here.

David's a clarinet player from Spain. English is his second language. But he just helped his partner generate $130,000 in 11 days.

Most copywriters grind out 50 emails a month to make $10k. Meanwhile, David made five figures from ONE campaign by adding something you already know how to do.

All he did was send a simple email a 6th grader could write.

120 people replied.

When someone replied, he'd ask a couple follow-up questions in the DMs.

If you can text your friend about dinner plans, you can do this. Those conversations gave him everything he needed for his sales campaign.

And because David's a smart cookie, He didn't even handle those DMs himself. He found someone else to do it. The campaign generated $130K total revenue. David's cut was somewhere between 20-40%.

I'm no math major, But even on the low end, I think that could put a few extra nickels in your rainy day fund.

Most copywriters get paid once per email or stack up $3k retainer clients.

When instead...

They could STOP trading time for money and START splitting revenue instead. You already know how to write emails. You already know how to send DMs. Put them together and you can stop chasing clients who ghost you after you deliver the work.

# Best Flexible Packaging for Small Coffee roasters [2025 Guide]

The flexible packaging market for coffee roasters is experiencing rapid growth, driven by increasing consumer demand for fresh, high-quality coffee and the need for sustainable, cost-effective packaging solutions. Small coffee roasters, in particular, face unique challenges, including limited budgets, smaller production runs, and the need to maintain product freshness and quality. Selecting the right flexible packaging is vital for brand identity, shelf life, and overall profitability.

This guide explores the best flexible packaging options available for small coffee roasters in 2025. We will discuss different types of materials, key features, benefits, and ideal use cases to help you make an informed decision for your business.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of flexible packaging for roasted coffee depends on various factors,including aroma retention,oxygen barrier,moisture protection,and aesthetics.Key features analysis is crucial for determining the best option.

**Material Composition:**

The material composition of flexible packaging significantly impacts its performance. Multi-layer films are commonly used, combining different materials to achieve specific properties. For instance, a layer of aluminum foil provides an excellent oxygen barrier, while a layer of polyethylene (PE) offers heat sealability.Other materials include polypropylene (PP), polyester (PET), and compostable options like polylactic acid (PLA). Understanding the roles of each layer is critical for selecting the right combination for your coffee's needs.

**Valve Technology:**

One-way degassing valves are essential for allowing carbon dioxide (CO2) released by freshly roasted coffee beans to escape without letting oxygen in. These valves maintain coffee freshness and prevent bags from bursting.High-quality valves effectively release CO2 while maintaining an airtight seal. The size and type of valve influence its performance, wiht some valves designed for faster degassing or specific pressure levels.

**Seal Strength and Integrity:**

The integrity of the seal is crucial for preventing oxygen and moisture from entering the package, wich can stale the coffee and compromise its flavor. Strong, consistent seals are vital for maintaining product freshness and preventing leaks during transportation and handling. Seal strength is measured in terms of peel strength and burst strength, indicating the force required to separate the seal or rupture the bag. Proper sealing equipment and settings are necessary to achieve optimal seal integrity.

**Printing and Aesthetics:**

Flexible packaging offers vast possibilities for branding and visual appeal.High-quality printing techniques, such as rotogravure and flexography, can create vibrant and eye-catching designs that attract customers. Customized printing allows roasters to showcase their brand identity,product facts,and unique selling propositions. The choice of inks, coatings, and finishes can further enhance the overall aesthetic and tactile experience.

**Bag Format and Size:**

Flexible packaging is available in various formats, including stand-up pouches, flat-bottom bags, side-gusseted bags, and rollstock for form-fill-seal machines. The choice of format depends on factors such as shelf presence, filling capabilities, and consumer convenience. Bag size should be appropriate for the quantity of coffee being packaged, with considerations for headspace and ease of handling.

## Core Benefits

Flexible packaging delivers several compelling advantages for small coffee roasters, enhancing product quality, customer appeal, and overall business efficiency.

**Extended Shelf Life:** High-barrier flexible packaging, combined with proper sealing and valve technology, significantly extends the shelf life of roasted coffee. This allows roasters to reach wider markets,reduce product waste,and maintain consistent quality over time. Properly sealed bags prevent oxidation and staling, ensuring that customers enjoy fresh, flavorful coffee.

**Enhanced Brand Image:** Flexible packaging provides a canvas for showcasing brand identity and creating a positive impression on customers. Eye-catching designs, premium materials, and informative labels can elevate the perceived value of the coffee and differentiate it from competitors. Customized packaging helps to build brand recognition and loyalty.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Compared to rigid packaging options like cans or glass jars, flexible packaging is generally more cost-effective in terms of material costs, transportation, and storage. Its lightweight nature reduces shipping expenses, and its compact form minimizes storage space requirements. This can significantly lower overall packaging costs, especially for small roasters with limited budgets.

**Sustainability:** Flexible packaging can be more sustainable compared to rigid alternatives, especially when using recyclable, compostable, or bio-based materials.Lightweight packaging reduces carbon emissions during transportation, and mono-material structures can facilitate easier recycling. Sustainable packaging options appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and enhance a brand's commitment to environmental responsibility.

**Versatility and Customization:** Flexible packaging offers a wide range of customization options to meet specific product and branding requirements. Roasters can choose from various materials,formats,sizes,printing techniques,and valve technologies to create packaging that perfectly aligns with their brand identity and product characteristics. This versatility allows for differentiation and targeted marketing strategies.

## FAQs Section

Common questions that small coffee roasters often ask regarding flexible packaging.

**What type of material is best for maintaining coffee freshness?**
Multi-layer films with an aluminum foil or metallized layer offer the best oxygen barrier, crucial for preventing staling. materials with high moisture barriers are also crucial.

**How critically important is a one-way degassing valve?**
Extremely important, especially for freshly roasted coffee. It allows CO2 to escape without letting oxygen enter, preventing bag inflation and preserving flavor. Without a valve, bags can burst, and the coffee will stale more quickly.

**Can I use compostable packaging for my coffee?**
Yes, compostable options like PLA are available, but they frequently enough offer less effective barriers than traditional materials. Consider the trade-offs between sustainability and shelf life when making your choice. Ensure the packaging is certified compostable for proper disposal.

**What is the minimum order quantity (MOQ) for custom-printed flexible packaging?**
MOQs vary widely depending on the supplier and printing method. Digital printing typically offers lower MOQs than rotogravure or flexography.Smaller roasters should seek suppliers specializing in short-run custom packaging.## Competitor Comparison

So the situation is the following. I'm 23M and about 3 weeks ago me and my now ex gf 22F broke up. Specifically, she broke up with me because she thinks in the last few months things have been rough between us, and so she thought the best solution for this problem was to separate and reevaluate our wants and needs. Now I do not agree with this decision, as I think relationship problems must be solutioned together, but that is another whole conversation.

Moving forward, a few days later we started talking again and have been doing so daily ever since. We spend time together and sometimes also sleep together, although we do not have intimacy such as kissing and sex. She is ok with other stuff, such as forehead kissing, hugging and other light physical contact.

An old friend of mine 22F and I started texting a week ago, went to grab a coffee together, etc. I do think she wants more than being just friends. Keep in mind my ex gf was a little jealous of this girl, as she knows we have been involved many years ago (specifically 5 years ago). 

I haven't told my ex gf about texting and going out with this girl. Also, of course I still have very strong feelings for my ex gf.

I'm trying to be a better person when it comes to moral problems and decisions. So my main concern is do I have the right to keep my dating life a secret, when me and my ex still talk so frequently?

I‚Äôve been doing keto diet for 25 days now - feeling good and have lost 7 pounds by keeping my net carbs under 25g and calories to 2,000 per day 

Lately, though, I‚Äôve been waking up earlier than I‚Äôd like, feeling super hungry. I usually have a snack before bed (last night it was a keto cookie), but I‚Äôm still waking up around 3 or 4am and can‚Äôt get back to sleep. I‚Äôll eventually get up and have coffee with heavy cream, which tides me over until breakfast around 8.

Is anyone else experiencing this?
Any tips or suggestions for bedtime snacks that help keep me full through the night?

So, I'm wondering if anyone in the community has tried any over the counter hearing aids? Do they actually work for you? And if so, where did you get them or somewhre online? Any tips on how to get some quick relief for my ears while I try to get a real appointment would be a huge help. Thanks

I lean towards medium roasts. I lean towards chocolate notes, nutty notes like almond, but not hazelnut. 

As harvests and seasons change, so do the notes of the roasts. My old fave was Unicorn Blood from Dark Matter Coffee, it used to have a strong peanut buttery smell when ground, and that carried into the espresso. 

Lattes and Cortados are my preferred drinking method, and I do sweeten a touch. 

I am not afraid of premium prices, as I want premium product. I explore from time to time and have probably done a good 50-60 bean roasts over the past 3-4 years.

Let‚Äôs consider a comparison. If I want to buy a ‚Äòhigh-end‚Äô hifi there are stores in most cities and large towns across the UK where I can go and look at the items and try them before deciding whether to buy. Where I live, within a one hour drive radius there are probably 10 or so stores where I can go to buy a ¬£20k hifi if I wish. All of the new hifi I have ever bought I have looked at first then listened to before buying.

However if I want to buy an espresso machine at the Lelit/Profitec/ECM etc level there seem to be a small handful of retailers in the UK from whom I can order online. I only know of one in the UK which has an actual showroom where I could even view, much less try, one of these machines before buying. Generally I have to buy mail order and ‚Äòblind‚Äô - relying on YouTube reviews and Reddit recommendations. If I receive it and then don‚Äôt like it well then‚Ä¶tough really.

Then there is the quality. When I buy a piece of high-end hifi I expect pretty stellar quality and performance, with superb longevity.

When I buy a high end espresso machine (judging from the YouTube reviews, Reddit discussions etc because that‚Äôs all I have to go on), I get steam knobs that look like they‚Äôve been lifted from a milk carton, water tanks that look like badly modified Tupperware containers with a couple of plastic tubes stuck in (sorry not meaning to pick on you in particular Lelit), drip trays that rattle loudly when a shot is being pulled (Profitec), or for many machines if I suddenly decide I want a random coffee in the afternoon I have to wait circa 30 minutes for the damn machine to warm up - 30 minutes!!!

Does this all indicate that the market for such espresso machines in the UK is just too small to make any showrooms economically viable? And that the worldwide market is too small to justify the R&D and testing to make higher quality espresso machines generally? Do I need to really pay La Marzocco or Slayer prices to get a decent quality basic espresso machine?

Finding the espresso machine market hard to fathom! Or am I missing some fundamentals here that explain why this market is so different from many others?",1,1751454617.0,espresso,12,0.67,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **MLS Showdown: LA Galaxy vs Vancouver Whitecaps FC ‚Äì A Tale of Two Teams with a Side of Over/Under Shenanigans**

**The Setup:**  
The LA Galaxy, fresh off their Club World Cup humiliation (they *lost to a team from Botswana*, people), host the Vancouver Whitecaps in a match that‚Äôs less of a ‚Äúclash of titans‚Äù and more of a ‚Äúwho‚Äôs less tired?‚Äù The odds are as tight as a goalie‚Äôs shorts during a penalty kick, with both teams hovering near 39% implied win probability (LA at +260, Vancouver at +250). The draw? A paltry 28.6%, which is about the same chance of a referee seeing a handball in a 90-minute game.

**Key Stats & Sarcasm:**

* **LA Galaxy**: They‚Äôre the defending MLS Cup champs, but let‚Äôs not get too excited‚Äîthey‚Äôve been outscored 11-6 in their last three games. Their star, **Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá**, is retired, but somehow the team still feels like it‚Äôs playing with one hand tied behind its back.
* **Vancouver Whitecaps**: They‚Äôve lost two in a row, but hey, at least they‚Äôre not the New York Red Bulls, who *somehow* lost to a team that plays in a parking lot. Their key man, **Pedro Vite**, is a scoring machine‚Ä¶ if you count ‚Äúscoring‚Äù as ‚Äútaking five shots and looking confused.‚Äù

**Injuries & Drama:**  
No major injuries reported, but let‚Äôs not forget: this is MLS, where ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù just means ‚Äúnot in a cast.‚Äù Vancouver‚Äôs **Ryan Gauld** is a threat to score from anywhere between a coffee table and a parking meter, but he‚Äôs as reliable as a weather forecast in Seattle.

**Odds Breakdown:**

* **LA Galaxy (-0.5)**: Implied probability \~39.2%
* **Vancouver Whitecaps (+0.5)**: Implied probability \~39.2%
* **Draw**: Implied probability \~28.6%

**Expected Value & Underdog Shenanigans:**  
The underdog win rate in soccer is 41%, so Vancouver‚Äôs 39.2% implied probability is *just* below that. If you‚Äôre feeling spicy, take Vancouver with the +0.5 line. The juice (vigorish) is minimal, and the Whitecaps‚Äô recent form suggests they‚Äôre due for a bounce-back.

**Best Bet:**  
**Vancouver Whitecaps (+0.5) at -110**  
Why? Because soccer is a game of chaos, and Vancouver‚Äôs underdog rate gives them a 1.8% edge over the implied probability. Plus, no one roots for the Galaxy harder than Zlatan‚Äôs ex-wife.

---

**NYCFC vs Toronto FC ‚Äì A Coach‚Äôs Nightmare**

**The Setup:**  
NYCFC, the 2021 MLS Cup champions, are now coached by **Pascal Jansen**, who has a win-loss record that reads like a broken calculator: 8-7-5. Toronto, coached by **Robin Fraser** (who‚Äôs been in the league longer than some of us have been alive), is on a three-game losing streak and has the energy of a team that lost its starting XI to a TikTok dance-off.

**Key Stats & Sarcasm:**

* **NYCFC**: They‚Äôve won five straight against Toronto, but let‚Äôs not get carried away‚Äîthey‚Äôre 6th in the East with 50 points. Their offense is as reliable as a Wi-Fi connection in a subway tunnel.
* **Toronto**: They‚Äôve lost 11th in the East with 37 points, but their +1.0 goal handicap line at -110 is basically a free bet if you‚Äôre into self-sabotage.

**Odds Breakdown:**

* **Toronto (+1.0) at -110**: Implied probability \~52.4%
* **NYCFC (-1.0) at -110**: Implied probability \~52.4%

**Expected Value & Underdog Shenanigans:**  
The underdog win rate in soccer is 41%, but Toronto‚Äôs +1.0 line implies a 52.4% chance of covering. That‚Äôs a 11.4% *disadvantage* compared to historical trends. Don‚Äôt take it.

**Best Bet:**  
**NYCFC (-1.0) at -110**  
Why? Because Toronto‚Äôs defense is a sieve, and NYCFC‚Äôs offense is‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs not great, but it‚Äôs not terrible either. The -1.0 line is a gift for bettors who enjoy watching Toronto‚Äôs players stare at the ball like it‚Äôs a math problem.

---

**Final Verdict:**

* **LA Galaxy vs Vancouver Whitecaps FC**: Take Vancouver (+0.5) for the underdog edge.
* **NYCFC vs Toronto FC**: Take NYCFC (-1.0) for the ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this is happening‚Äù factor.

Remember, soccer is a game of luck, injuries, and referees who think ‚Äúhandball‚Äù is a new TikTok filter. Bet accordingly. üèÜ‚öΩ

That‚Äôs been me lately.

Every morning is a fight to get out of bed. The routine has gotten stale. Same four walls. Same to-do list. Same loop. It‚Äôs like a weekly battle against despair.



I think it‚Äôs something a lot of us (and for entrepreneurs, maybe this is on steroids) deal with‚Äîshowing up every day, doing the work, but in the back of your mind you hear a voice saying ***‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù*** Yet you have no choice but to keep going.

And sure, I *know* I should be more grateful, more appreciative, more hopeful‚Äîbut sometimes that doesn‚Äôt even help.



Lately, the main thing that‚Äôs helped me combat this whole thing is **changing my environment and routine.**

I‚Äôve been working from coffee shops more just to get out of the same four walls. I‚Äôm writing this from one right now, actually. Something about it makes me block out all these negative thoughts.

I‚Äôve also been loosening up my routine. Instead of my usual 5:30am wake-up > walk > prayer/bible time > gym > 10‚Äì7 workday > dinner > bed‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve started shifting things around. Sleeping in some days. Working later into the night. Something about working late feels gritty‚Äîand brings a little spark back.



**My point, is that I‚Äôm not perfect.** I‚Äôve got my own stuff I‚Äôm working through. But that‚Äôs what this space is for‚Äîbeing real with each other about the hard stuff. And right now, this is mine.

Honestly, it feels good to share it. I know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way, and I hope if you‚Äôre in it too, you know you‚Äôre not alone either.

‚ÄúMy father is a beast, yes I said it, a beast and a terrorist, a rapist and every other evil and vile thing the criminals do in Italy! I hate him‚Äù I said, holding the paper in my hands and shaking with anger as I ruffled it and threw it to the floor.



‚ÄúI hate home, and I never want to go back, my life since moving to Malta has been nothing short of beautiful, the handsome waiter I met last week, finally wants to take me on a nice date, somewhere fancy but instead I've been summoned home by my father,‚Äù I said as I threw my handbag to the couch and slumped into it. 



‚ÄúTONIGHT!‚Äù I screamed, ‚ÄúAnd that ASSHOLE will also be there‚Äù



My cousin and best friend in the world, Fiona sat beside me as I cried continuously.



‚ÄúIf you refuse this, I'm sure you will be dragged to the plane‚Äù she said, sounding sorry for me as she picked up the paper to read its content. 



‚ÄúI thought when my father said ‚ÄòDo whatever you want, I don't want to see your pathetic face around.‚Äô He meant it, what could this man need me for, I'm done with that life, I want to be done Fiona‚Äù I cried into the couch pillow.



‚ÄúLook on the bright side, at least he will unfreeze the account now, and we can pay for the apartment we wanted, just go to the party, and come back, it's just tonight right, it doesn't say you have to sleep over,‚Äù she said rubbing my shoulder lightly before lying on it.



‚ÄúI know it's hard girl, but you will get through it, c‚Äômon let's help you get a dress, you are still the beautiful eccentric Ariana Rinaldi, you have to stick it to your stepsisters, you know they will be there, with their gawking eyes,‚Äù she said ruffling my hair and pulling me to stand on my feet, 



Which I did reluctantly.



‚ÄúI don't want to go, I wish I could tell them a train hit me or something‚Äù I said, shaking my head in protest.



‚ÄúNot a chance, come on, let's go to La Perla Maltese boutique‚Äù she said, coming to pull me to the door.



3 hours later I was heading home to Italy to attend this party my father had decided to throw for my asshole adopted brother Matteo.



His name sent waves of pure irritation down my spine as I shrugged the thought of him from my mind. I hate him, with every fibre of my being, he is an asshole and I'm glad everyone sees it now.



A rotten bastard, my father would call him in secret, so why is he throwing this elaborate party for him and why should I be in the midst of all these old vile men?



I picked the invitation that had visibly been crumbled badly, and straightened it again, I read its content again, this time more clearly



You are cordially invited to an evening of intrigue and indulgence at the estate of the esteemed Don Vincenzo Rinaldi.



date: 30th of January 2023



Time: midnight until dawn



Location: Villa Rinaldi, nestled away amidst the shadows of Marina Verde.



Dress code: black for men, women are free to choose what enthrals them, with a hint of mystery.



Join us under the shield of the night, as we celebrate loyalty, life and the bonds of our fraternity. Revel in the finest cuisine, exquisite wines Sicily has to offer, and the temptations of forbidden pleasures.



But remember, within these walls, restraint is paramount, and the currency of the night is secrets, trust only those you know, for treachery carries severe consequences



The Rinaldi Family.



I looked at it with annoyance, these fake parties these men throw just to show who is more powerful, I was immediately disgusted.



It used to be my father, but now it seems Mateo is the new hotshot Don in town, calling all the shots, and my father didn't like it.



That must have cut deep into my papa, so why would he throw this party in his honour? And why do I have to be there?



Not after the last time he and my stepmother tricked me into offending Papa so much that I had to decide to leave Italy.



My father is like a vulture, he waits for you and then strikes.



Long after, I stepped out of the plane that I‚Äôd finished the process and I was home free.



All I could imagine was how I'd react to meeting that lying asshole again, and how fast I can't wait to get out of there.



My dad just picked the wrongest day to do this to me!



Just when Enzo finally asked me to be his girl, something I‚Äôd been hoping for. 



I walked past the baggage claim and headed for the airport door.



As the door opened I took a deep breath, let out all the negative thoughts in my head and embraced a positive aura.



I smiled and as I did, a man carrying a fan passed me blowing the invitation from my hand.



I shrieked and leapt for it, I caught it before it could fly off and I steadied myself to land.



As I did I landed in the firm grip of a male airport police officer, his grip was much too tight to be friendly.



‚ÄúLet go of me! what is this?‚Äù I inquired, my heart suddenly beating out of my chest.



‚ÄúAre you Ariana Rinaldi?‚Äù he asked, looking intently at me, I looked at him in fright. 



Do I deny my name right now or is this one of Papa‚Äôs men?



I decided to go with the daunting hope that it was the former.



‚ÄúYes, I am, what the hell is this?‚Äù I asked, jerking my arm from his grip, I watched as two female officers joined him, the blond one reached into her pocket to bring out what I hoped she was not!



‚ÄúYou are under Arrest for conspiring with Italian criminal and mafia don, Mateo Donatelli, to intentionally distribute hard drugs, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law‚Äù the male officer announced, gesturing to the blond officer to place the handcuff.



‚ÄúWhat! He is just my adopted brother! I don't know anything about this!‚Äù 



But they didn't care, I was already getting hurled out and tossed into the police car.



I haven't even properly landed, Mateo, you slimy piece of shit, and I already want to murder you!







# MY BROTHER, MY OLD FOE







Mateo‚Äôs pov\~



‚ÄúWho arrested my useless daughter?‚Äù I heard my adopted father, Don Vincenzo Rinaldi thunder as I walked into his office.



I stood far from his line of sight, I was not going to soil his mood further just when he was about to acknowledge me among the brotherhood.



‚ÄúWhat do you mean! What?‚Äù he yelled again slamming his cane on the glass table shattering it.



I knew something would happen the moment I called Interpol officer, Pius Asissi‚Äôs bluff, it was good fun, something to irritate my father but I didnt know he would blow it out of proportion.



He slammed the phone on the table, turned and lunged at me almost immediately.



‚ÄúYou bastard! You got my daughter arrested!‚Äù he growled, ‚Äúfix it! You get her out and bring her back here tonight! I will not be ridiculed by the other families, calling me weak for not putting my house in order! Or worse think im a snitch! Get her out and quietly, Or else you can kiss your recognition goodbye‚Äù he added before releasing my shirt and throwing me against the wall.



I clenched my fist in anger and my jaw tightened next, but I gathered myself and smiled casually at him. ‚ÄúConsider it done‚Äù I replied, calmly walking out of his office.



As I closed the door behind me, the anger started to well up inside me and I stormed out of the mansion.



Julius my caporegime, noticed my mood and followed closely behind.



‚ÄúIs he going to be a problem Don?‚Äù he inquired taking a glance at the mansion one last time before opening the door for me.



‚ÄúMy father is a demon, yes, but this is not one of those days, this is about my annoying sister getting arrested and Pius Asissi‚Äôs inability to take a fucking joke‚Äù I grinned.



He turned over to the other side and got into the car, before gesturing to the driver to start the car.



‚ÄúSir what are your orders‚Äô he asked, straight to the point, his loyalty was the same as it was with my biological father Don Donatelli.



He passed away when I was seventeen and coincidentally I got adopted by the same person he warned me never to trust.



‚ÄúWe need to get her out and bring her back here‚Äù I started, ‚Äútonight, or else he is going to pin something on me and make me look like a criminal again, I can't afford that‚Äù.



I started to ask myself, knowing Pius to be a logical man if blowing this out of proportion meant he wanted something. I needed to figure it out.



‚ÄúSet a meeting with Pius, he and I need to talk‚Äù I added.



6 hours later he flew in from Albania, delaying me for a reason.



‚Äú what do you want pius? Name it, but I need you to hand over the girl in your custody, she‚Äôs a menace I need to be done with‚Äù I started, standing across from him in front of the airport police department.



‚ÄúMy bosses are tired of your father, we want him out‚Äù he mentioned, crossing his hand



‚ÄúThey want or you want? I know how blackmail goes officer Asissi‚Äù I mentioned casually.



Pius snickered and clapped his hands together.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I know you are the right guy, however, you are the one to do it, get it done, we want your father out of the game‚Äù he declared, ‚Äúdeal?‚Äù he asked looking at me.



I stopped and threw a glance at Julius, he only stared back.



‚ÄúDeal‚Äù I responded.



‚ÄúGreat, I'll be in touch, let me know when the time is right, for now, Miss Ariana is in the interrogation room waiting for you to take her home‚Äù he smiled, walking past me into the facility.



I couldn't believe it, they are just as sick of his shit as I am.



I suddenly felt a rush of power flow through me, I felt like I could conquer.



The only one standing in my way was my bastard half-brother Emiliano, so I made him disappear.



I took a deep breath as I relaxed my raging mind, I made a deal to betray my stepfather, to save my annoying sister from prison.



She has not changed at all, always disrupting my plans to conquer.



But today I refused to engage in her petty attitude.



Her full, Sharp mouth stirred a man to anger.



As I stepped into the hallway leading to the interrogation room, I stopped in front of the door.



I readied myself for the self-loathing little bitch I've always known at the other end of the door.



I stepped back a little as our eyes suddenly met.



A beautiful woman with long flowing hair, soft hazel eyes and lips full like plum looked back at me as I opened the door.



I was awestruck, this can't be Ariana!



Just as I was about to concoct words to speak, she poured a cup of warm coffee on my face.



‚ÄúYou slimy piece of shit!‚Äù she yelled. ‚ÄúYou got me arrested!‚Äù



‚ÄúRelax, there was a communication error, it's all been handled, and you are free to go‚Äù I mentioned, I watched her flare up and she started for the open door when suddenly she slipped on the coffee she spilt on me.



Like a reflex I was pulled to sweep her off her feet, I held onto her and swung her away from the spilt coffee.



She was dumbfounded, obviously none of us was expecting that.



‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I inquired,



‚ÄúJust take me home‚Äù she replied with a flustered face, moving past me and out of the room.



The sweet scent of her luscious hair still hanging in the air.



I complied willingly, a few minutes to midnight I had safely dropped her off in front of her father‚Äôs mansion.



I waited for her to go in before going in.



I hadn't gone very far when I heard a conversation in the hallway.



‚ÄúWow, I like your dress, so simple, it fits you, are you going for the virgin look, do you think ours is slutty?‚Äù her step-sister Serena. asked looking at the younger sister Luna who was looking down at her bare chest, visibly open to expose the fullness of her breast, she wore a sultry-looking red gown that showed her curves.



‚ÄúNo Serena, you both look good, I'm just on my way to the sitting area to wait for the party to start,‚Äù Ariana replied in defence.



‚ÄúMom, I think Ariana is brushing us off, and acting like a prude to gain Father‚Äôs favour‚Äù Luna said.



‚ÄúNo, you both look Good, I just prefer this style of clothing, it's not a big deal okay?‚Äù she reassured, trying to move past her sisters.



‚ÄúOh so you are brushing it off, so you do think my girls are slutty!‚Äù their mother retorted



I watched her take deep breaths.



This was amusing, I was invested in watching how it would all play out.



‚ÄúTake it off, give it to Luna, I want her to wear it,‚Äù her stepmother said softly but clearly, making me wonder sometimes if she was on some sort of meds.



Should I step in? Is it worth it?



I'm an asshole after all.



‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù she asked looking at them, ‚Äúno that's not going to happen‚Äù she retorted.



Luna moved to her back and started to unzip her clothes slowly.



I watch in amazement, right in the hallway.



Not only have I been thinking about what she would look like outside that yellow frock dress, on my bed in Milan.



I get to see it‚Ä¶.



Serena soon joined her and together they helped her undress until she stood silently in the hallway with her panties and silk bra.



I was too far to see and Serena blocked off my view.



I could feel her suddenly feel embarrassed.



‚ÄúBest hurry up and get dressed, it's almost midnight the guests have started to arrive, sweety, welcome home‚Äù Maria smiled moving past her gently, the smell of her choking French cologne filled the air



Then we heard voices, she quickly bolted with the red dress in her hand and hid in one of the corners, I peered from the corner and saw her father walking into the hallway.



someone was with him, his consigliere Luchi.



I'm fucked how do I explain this.



I peered again, I saw him walking off into another room, I bolted to the open door opposite where I hid.



As I ran my eyes caught someone, a woman, her soft brown eyes scanned me as I froze for a moment in her beauty.



Her skin was supple and I never knew she had a beauty mark close to her belly button.



Ariana‚Ä¶.







# A NIGHT I SHOULD SOON FORGET



 



Ariana‚Äôs Pov\~



There he is again, in the shadows, peeking and lurking as always.



He hasn't changed a bit.



The sight of him irritated me I couldn't linger, I walked past him after a nice heartfelt ‚Äúcongratulations‚Äù



I may be wearing just my undies but I'll make damn sure I move past him in demure.



‚ÄúYou haven't apologised for pouring that distasteful coffee at me‚Äù



I ignored him.



He grabbed my arm and pulled me to him, ‚Äúdon't walk away from me when I'm speaking Bambino‚Äù he said holding my face in his big gruff murderous hands.



I pushed him and he grabbed me again.



‚ÄúYou asshole let me go‚Äù I grunted trying to free my arm from his strong grasp.



‚ÄúWhy? Why should I let you go? you have grown over the years‚Äù he said looking at my chest and licking his lips.



I used all my strength to evade him as I yanked myself free and bolted.



A deranged Asshole, he smelled like alcohol too.



Thankfully far away from him, I went into a spare room to change into the red gown.



I straightened the red fabric to hide evidence from the scuffle with my step sisters earlier.



The leaders of the other family soon arrived, The old family la Famiglia Nera family was present, their leader Don Antonio Argento and his wife Liana, with their children their son Silvio Argento and his sister Sophia as well as 3 other women whose identities I didn't know, arrived much later but separately.



bodyguards stood close by as well.



Another family just as ruthless as mine and Mateo‚Äôs.



Silvio looked in my direction, he didn't smile, but his eyes fixed on my chest, my breasts full like plum, he rummaged my body with his eyes in very uncomfortable ways and I immediately wanted the earth to open up and swallow me.



My father spoke first and picked up his wine glass,



‚ÄúWelcome to Villa Rinaldi, today is a peaceful day because for once, for more than 10 years the 3 families are at peace‚Äù he said holding his glass to chest level, his glass resting on his burly body.



The others raised their glass, one of the three women who came in, one was American, an outsider and everyone gave her distasteful looks occasionally.



‚ÄúMatteo ‚Äúthe shadow‚Äù Donatelli,‚Äù my father said as he tapped him on the shoulder and squeezed hard which made mate readjust himself on his seat.



‚ÄúLike a son to me, I remember when you came to me after your father‚Äôs accident, sad and alone, devoid of life, but now look at you! You are now a Don in your own right!‚Äù he laughed softly and everyone followed in his delusion, everyone knew it was just a ruse to maintain his godfather status and keep Mateo on a leash.



I saw Luna signal my attention as she spun around slowly in my blue dress, I was instantly angry, she looked like she had been thrown inside my gown, her sister would not even stay with her most of the party, to avoid being photographed with her.



I hate today, I hate this party, I don't want to be here.



I watched for a little while as the Argento family and members of mine gathered around Mateo to congratulate him, It would be disrespectful if I stood there and did not congratulate him in front of my father.



So I gathered myself and walked to him, I stopped a few inches in front of him, but also enough distance away from his grasp, ‚ÄúCongratulations Don Matteo,‚Äù I said unexcitedly.



Mateo's pov\~



I watched her expression, she faked her smile, but she looked breathtaking in that red gown.



I had this primal urge to devour her right here, but she‚Äôs my adopted sister.



This isn't right, though I was irresponsibly drunk I did my best to make sure It was unnoticed.



I had my American woman Becky on my arm. 



She looked at me, and she gave me a warm smile, this was the first time she‚Äôd met my family.



‚ÄúBaby doll, thank you, is that all you are going to say, bambino? We have an unfinished business sister ""I said looking at her, my eyes kept going over her body, and I wondered if Becky was pretending not to notice.



I raised my head, looked down at her full chest and licked my lips again.



She gave me an irritated look, her pretty face in a full scowl, the only thing that had changed about her was her beauty.



Who the hell is this radiant woman standing before me?



It can't be Ariana‚Ä¶. My annoying sister?



I felt deep hate for her, not after the lies she spread about me back in school.



Unfortunately leading to the suicide attempt of her friend Chiara, I never lived it down.



Now her family has burdened me with her care forever, all because of Ariana.



‚ÄúExcuse me, Don Matteo, I'll take my leave now‚Äù she replied gently, I raised the cup to my mouth and looked at her with those devilish green eyes of mine, and I watched her hurriedly flee from my presence.



I watched her go, each step she took accentuated her curves in ways I never noticed before.



My head was spinning, but this primal urge to have her was winning.



She walked around before noticing her stepmother shoot dagger eyes from across the room where she sat talking with Liana Argento, and I knew it was her cue to leave.



I saw her grab the bottle of champagne from one of the tables and head upstairs to her room.



I couldn't let her go, she called to me, just like she did when we were teens and we would sneak around.



The silent and wicked invitation to play in her room.



Is this one of them or is this the alcohol?



I had to know I had to find out, my head was spinning out of control.



my eyes felt like they would close but I was on a mission to find out exactly why she keeps teasing me with those hateful doe eyes of hers.



‚ÄúBaby? Are you okay? You look like you need a seat my love‚Äù Becky started, putting a hand over me.



‚ÄúI'm okay, I guess I drank way too much,‚Äù I replied, kissing her lips softly.



‚ÄúI'll be right back, stay right here, I should pour some water on my face, then I'll be okay‚Äù I noted.



I got up and lost my footing a bit but I readjusted my gait, and I stood tall.



‚ÄúYou want me to come with you?‚Äù she asked.



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I cut in almost immediately. 



‚ÄúStay here‚Äù



I watched her face turn to worry, but she obeyed me and wouldn't dare challenge me, not on a very significant night like this.



I gathered my drunk self and I started to walk towards the stairs.



I was starting to zone out, but I had to maintain my composure until I was well away from prying eyes.



I had to know Ariana. Are you a clone?



When did you get to look so good, why haven't I had time to notice?



All this while she‚Äôs been in Malta, hiding from me.



Soon I got to her door, when I heard chatter.



I heard her laugh at the other end ‚ÄúI wish I was back in Malta Fi‚Äù she mentioned, before hearing a loud thud on the bed.



My senses were heightened, I pressed my ear on the door and I could hear the faint voice replying to her over the phone.



‚ÄúI know girl, it's just for tonight okay, after that we finally get our peace, the apartment Is just 1 step away,‚Äù her friend said calmly.



‚ÄúTell me what happened when you saw him,‚Äù she inquired as she giggled.



Ohhhh interesting‚Ä¶. This is about me.



How long has she been thinking about me?



‚ÄúStill a scoundrel Fi, you know how much I hate him‚Äù she replied to her, I heard her kick something.



A scoundrel? Me? Don Matteo Donatelli, heir to the feared powerful Famiglia Donatelli Mafia!



Unacceptable.



I heard her unzip her gown, the sound of it drove me instantly insane.



I burst the door open, the door almost flew from its hinges, I stepped in and closed it behind me.



I stood by the door and watched her scamper to cover herself from my lustful gaze.



‚ÄúLet me call you back Fi,‚Äù she said discontinuing the call as she tried to zip back up the gown I kept eye fucking.



‚ÄúWhat are you doing in my room, please leave, yours is next door, if memory serves me right‚Äù she stated brazenly as she gestured to the door ‚ÄúPlease leave‚Äù



I looked at her for a little while, my eyes fixed on her body, I could feel this was going to end badly.



‚ÄúMateo.. Please lea..‚Äù as she spoke I walked up to her, frantically she looked around, grabbed her wine glass from her dresser and threw it at me, i ducked immediately but I could see I upset her.



‚ÄúYou called me a scoundrel‚Äù



I soon reached her, grabbed her neck and pushed her gently against the glass window. 



‚ÄúSo mouthy,‚Äù I said almost faintly, my breath reeked of alcohol and I didnt care. 



I pressed my lips to hers and kissed her with so much intensity she had to push me away with all her strength.



I was hungry for her, like a wild beast about to devour.



‚ÄúMateo get out of my room‚Äù she cried but the music was too loud and I was too intoxicated to understand logic.



She ran towards the door but I grabbed her just in time and pressed her face to the glass window again.



‚ÄúWhere are you running off to Bambino?‚Äù I pressed myself against her and I could feel the hardness of my cock against her ass.



‚ÄúI've been looking at you all night, only you, I like this red dress on you, I want to rip it off you and fuck you till you beg me to stop‚Äù I whispered into her ear.



The hair behind her head stood as they felt my raspy breath.



I knew she wanted me to, pretence is her best tactic.



‚ÄúStop this Mateo! You are drunk get off me you asshole‚Äù She tried to free my arm behind her but I had her pinned good on the window.



We could see from the window, her sister Serena with someone outside, but I couldn't take a closer look.



I was much too distracted by this goddess before me.



‚ÄúLet's play a little game like we used to,‚Äù I said, unzipping the rest of the gown with one hand and pinning her down with the other.



‚ÄúI don't want to play your stupid games, let me go Mateo‚Äù she cried again shaking herself free.



‚ÄúNo need to run bambino‚Äù I said as my hand pulled her gown free and it fell to my feet. 



With my knee, I spread her legs further apart.



Her arms are still pinned behind her.



I pressed myself some more into her body as I used my free hand to touch her boobs before releasing it from its cups.



‚ÄúMateo‚Äù she whispered as I flicked her nipples. 



‚ÄúPlease stop this‚Äù



‚ÄúNo my sweet doll, I want to fuck you until you beg me to stop,‚Äù I said, I traced my finger around her thongs before moving down towards her shamelessly moist pussy.



I touched the wet moisture and played around with her pussy for a while, she let out a small moan and I could tell she regretted it as her eyes started to fill with tears.



I brought my fingers to my face and licked it.



‚ÄúSee how wet you are for me, you have been thinking of me haven't you?‚Äù 







# SAVED BY MY DOLL







ARIANA'S POV\~



An hour later, Mateo walked out of my room without so much as a backward glance.



the past 1 hour of my life had been a whirlwind I chose never to revisit, but I can't help but think that my body will not soon forget.



This man who just left so casually after violating me, as I held on to my pillows, sweaty and naked on my bed, my hair badly ruffled and the sheets torn beyond recognition.



What just happened? Did I let this man do this to me? I just surrendered, just like Chaira did,



I felt so sick to my stomach as a sudden feeling of nausea overtook me.



This asshole, heartless bastard has just taken my virginity.



Like it was nothing! 



I boiled inside me, I clenched my pillow tightly as I cried into it, I hate him so much, I wish he would die!



I quickly gathered myself from my bed and went to the bathroom to soak myself in my own self-loathing.



Moments later, I heard a loud knock on the door. I tied my towel and went out, curious to find who was at my door.



‚ÄúOpen the door‚Äù my stepmother‚Äôs loud voice called, fear ripped through my entire body as I heard that cold tone.



Did she see Mateo leave my room?



I opened the door gently, though wishing the door would magically fall and land on her head.



She stepped in, looked around and shook her head when she saw the champagne on the counter.



‚ÄúDid you leave the party your father and I took out time to plan to come and drink yourself to death in your room. How ungrateful! You are nothing but a roach, you deserve nothing but crumbs‚Äù she said as she waved her hand in my face,



I was quiet with my head down, her ramblings weren't new to me, and she was the least of my worries.



Seeing that I gave her no reply she stopped yapping.



‚ÄúYour father has requested your audience in the main room, he hopes you will not come looking like the cheap whore that you are,‚Äù she said before stepping out of my room.



I closed the door behind her, I leaned against the wall, why can't I go unnoticed in this family?



Even when I try to leave their presence they always find me, It never ends



A few minutes later I was wearing my plain clothes since the red dress was ruined and Luna had stolen mine.



I went down to the main room, where my father looked visibly upset about the modesty of my dressing but he gestured to me to stand beside him which I did.



my father rarely did this unless he had an announcement to make as a family.



My father adjusted himself again and started to speak.



‚Äú well! you all have heard the rumours and you know why I have called you here, today will be a very historical moment in our family's long line of business and brotherhood,‚Äù he said gesturing towards me to stand in front of him.



‚ÄúThis is a formal announcement to strengthen the bond of our union and of our families, the Argento and Rinaldi families have betrothed their children Silvio and Ariana to be married to keep the peace and for some peace to continue salute‚Äù he finished



‚Äúpapa‚Ä¶‚Äù I started, and he turned and shot me deadly glares, glares all too familiar.



What? I'm engaged? Silvio Argento is no different from Mateo, he looked at me earlier as though he was going to dissect me.



I was too scared to confront my father, all I am to him is a bargaining chip for his gain, and that's what it has always been.



I froze, I felt everything around me spinning out of my control, I could hear my heart beating uncontrollably, as the sound of cheers faded out,



how did it get to this? I'm supposed to be on my way to Malta!



I soon realized I could never go back to Malta, I was going to be stuck here, I was getting married to a bloodthirsty killer like Mateo, and ill be another bitter mafia wife.



the life I've been avoiding was laid right in front of me and my father had thrown me to the wolves.



What will he do when he finds out that I'm no longer a virgin? My hands started to shake anxiously as I clenched my dress over my things.



I watched as Silvio walked in my direction. He is a very tall and handsome Man I must admit, he looked gentlemanly with his blond tinted hair. but he is no better than Madman Mateo.



He stopped at my side and put a flower in my hair. he took my hand and pulled me close to his chest. ‚ÄúYou are mine now, Ariana‚Äù he whispered in my ear.



That shot coldly fit through my body, he touched me lightly and I quickly pulled away.



Mateo smiled at me cheerfully, as he walked towards Silvio and me, his teeth visibly showing, ‚Äúcongratulations Silvio, and to you sister‚Äù he said casually as though he had not just taken my virginity just an hour ago In my bed, he leaned into me and planted a soft kiss on my cheeks and my face almost turned red.



My heart sank! Congratulations? From him!



my life is over.



Mateo got up and clinked his glass, ‚ÄúI also have an announcement to make‚Äù he said as he swung his American friend in the air and dropped her in front of him.



He brought out a box and offered it to Becky, she opened it and her mouth flew open and her eyes stuck out, the glow of joy suddenly filled her face as she brought out a shiny diamond ring from the box.



‚ÄúBecky will you be my wife‚Äù he asked, she made a dramatic happy dance, she screamed a loud resounding yes and everyone erupted in another round of cheer.



I don't understand what's going on here, Did he just propose?



I started to fidget, my anger started to tear me apart internally as I felt this burning rage inside me like a volcano about to erupt.



‚ÄúI guess there's no time better than any to tell you this!‚Äù Becky smiled holding her fiance‚Äôs neck and swinging from side to side.



‚ÄúI'm pregnant!‚Äù she screamed, Mateo‚Äôs face changed and he lifted her in the air and spun her around.



‚ÄúAh congratulations Mateo,‚Äù my father said tapping his shoulder again.



This night was the worst night of my life, I tried to avoid Silvio‚Äôs gaze all night and focused on the ruthless bastard who seemed to have violated me for sport.



I cursed him continuously as my heart ached in deep pain that shot through my body like electric jolts.



He didn't even as much as look at me the rest of the party.



I wanted to leave again, but not before I caught the glance of a shiny object someone was taking out of their leg pocket.



I saw one of the girls earlier who I didn't know, walking stealthily towards Matteo, so she was behind him. I tried to signal him but the chatter and the music wouldn't let me be heard. Maybe I'm wrong.



I saw her raise the knife slowly at his back. I sprang up in a sudden bid to save him. I picked up my father‚Äôs cane he was using to support himself beside me, and I threw it in Mateo‚Äôs direction. 



‚ÄúMateo! Behind you!‚Äù







# A HAPPY DAY







MATEO‚ÄôS POV\~



Just as swiftly as I heard Ariana‚Äôs voice, I turned around in time to catch the knife mid-air before it landed in my back, i hit it out of the hand of the brunette-haired girl that had escorted Silvio‚Äôs sister Sophia to this party, my ‚ÄúFATHER‚Äù threw for me.



I quickly incapacitated her and grabbed the kitchen knife on the feast table and grabbed her hair, my bodyguards seeing this quickly armed up and pointed their guns at the Argentos.



They feared no one, after all, I paid them heavily just to fear no fucking person.



I knew my enemies would come, I expected it and I'm Always ready.



Taking sips and Pretending to be drunk all night has been fun until I really got drunk, I slipped up and now I can't remember the last hour and a half.



Silvio‚Äôs bodyguards had also drawn arms and faced me and the Rinaldi family, and in retaliation theirs also drew arms. 



, the entire room was now still as all three houses were now armed and fully ready for war, I smirked, I thought we had come for a peace pact.



‚ÄúDon Argento, you mind explaining this?‚Äù I asked as I raised the girl by her hair to face the argentos, I waved my knife in the air before placing it on her neck.



Don Argento and Silvio looked at Sophia who was now behind her brother, for an explanation.



‚ÄúI don't know who she is, my assistant didn't show up and she is a last-minute hire, you know how I have to always have an assistant, papa‚Äù she cried, looking at her family with teary eyes.



She understood well that she had pissed off her dad who slapped her effectively as the words left her lips.



Another dumb bitch, her father faced me ‚ÄúWe are not associated with this woman, and so you can take her and do whatever you want with her‚Äù he said coldly.



‚ÄúI can?‚Äù I asked sarcastically, drunk and looking around the room with her hair firm in my clutch, the woman didn't beg for mercy, she was mute, except for the times she would groan from the pull on her hair.



I raised her to the level of my shoulders, her feet hanging in the air, ‚Äúwho sent you‚Äù I asked her, but she didn't reply and it irritated me badly, she was willing to die to protect her employer, so be it.



I faced the assassin Ariana who had called my attention to her.



I smiled and in one swift movement I slit her throat, and I watched the horror wash through Ariana‚Äôs face,



the bitch who made people call me a girl killer back in school has made me a girl killer again.



I threw the lifeless body of the assassin on the floor, her blood-stained my finger, still maintaining eye contact with ariana I licked my fingers and then erupted in a loud cheer.



‚ÄúWith that out of the way, let us drink to another decade of peace!‚Äù I laughed heartily and raised my glass.



Don Argento raised his and so did Don Rinaldi, whose hot stares I could feel at the back of my head.



I picked my fiance Becky and spun her in the air, she laughed heartily ‚ÄúWe have a wedding to plan‚Äù I laughed, I took another glance at Ariana, her face full of fright as she visibly trembled.



‚ÄúThank you Ari for the lookout out‚Äù I said before going to hug her tightly, she smelled like sex, and her hair smelled of new shampoo, like she just took a bath.



The nape of her neck looked like it had a hand print on it, my mind immediately flashed to something, and before I was able to grab onto it, it flew just as fast as it came.



Damnit.



She pulled her terrified body that suddenly felt too familiar away from mine, ‚Äúy‚Ä¶yes‚Äù she stuttered as brushing my hands gently away from her arms.



She had always felt herself too good for me, and her father never failed to remind me every day how he saved me.



The whole family disgusted me, so I will show them the fullest extent of how far I'm willing to go to prove that I own Italy now, killing my bastard half-brother was a start.



I gave her a small peck on her lips and withdrew to face her father, I smiled heartily ‚ÄòDON! Celebrations are in order! Congratulations once again,‚Äù I laughed before hugging him and immediately retreating, as much as I liked to pull enemies closer, Don Rinaldi is a poison I don't even want close to my tux.



‚ÄúI'll be taking my leave now‚Äù I kept smiling as I gestured to my fiance Becky to follow, ‚Äúplease expect my invitation in a few days, I can't wait to marry this ravishing woman‚Äù I laughed as I grabbed Becky‚Äôs butt in front of everyone, she chucked and grabbed unto my neck and folded a leg up to my torso.



A month later I was wearing my wedding tux and looking rather ravishing if I must add, I dusted invisible dirt off my right shoulder and shot myself a striking pose in the mirror before I left the room, I walked down the hallway towards the main door of my villa to stand at the beautifully decorated podium, my Becky had chosen.



As I reached the main gate I remembered I had hidden my well-written vows from snoopy Becky in the kitchen, I gestured to my bodyguard to wait for me, and I walked briskly to the kitchen when I suddenly stopped in my steps, the guest room on the ground floor was opened slightly and I heard chatters, I moved closer.



‚ÄúYou know that black girl he is marrying, I heard she‚Äôs a retired escort, they met in Miami when he went there to check on the containers personally‚Äù I heard a man say, I fumed with anger, ‚Äúa whore! Amazing, he is just immature, and can never act like a true Don, he knows we don't marry our whores‚Äù the other man laughed, I knew those voices, they were people he did business with, I wanted them dead immediately, I pulled out my pistol and was about to burst in when I saw my beautiful bride run down the hallway to where I stood, I met her halfway.



‚ÄúBaby! Everyone is waiting bunny!‚Äù Becky yelled, I quickly hid my gun grabbed her and raised her in the air, she looked so breathtaking I kissed her intensely.



‚ÄúIt's bad luck to see the bride before the main wedding‚Äù she laughed hitting me o my shoulder, ‚Äúforget that anymore, I want to bend you over and fuck you right here in that gown,‚Äù I said as I grabbed her close to my hard cock.



‚ÄúWe have so much time for that, AFTER the wedding, come on‚Äù She kissed me and quickly pulled away, she grabbed my arm and pulled me to the door.



Moments later we were faced in front of my seated colleagues and family, as well as some of her friends from America, she was an orphan and she didn't have a family.



‚ÄúWill you Becky take Mateo to be your‚Ä¶‚Ä¶



Becky‚Äôs face changed, she held her abdomen before giving out a loud shriek, I watched as my fiance slumped to the ground!

I have seen on XHS many amazing coffee shops and tea houses in old temples, traditional buildings and truly scenic spaces. I was hoping some of you would have some recommendations. 

I am looking to drink coffee and tea in serene, historic spaces that are relaxing and tranquil. I am struggling to find the recommendations I‚Äôve found on XHS as they‚Äôre in mandarin and I don‚Äôt read/write mandarin so any English translations or directions would be much appreciated. 

Some examples of what I‚Äôve found are ONE STEP in the temple of earth? And HUI temple in Zhizhu temple - I hope to visit these places and other similar shops.

- the 60% cliff and 
- the loss of child benefits at 100k.     
Agree that: 
- ¬£100k for a family of 4 in London is not a lot.     

There is an increasing number of posts on how young professionals living in London on their own, don‚Äôt feel well off on ¬£100k.     
     
I think these sort of posts and this sort of press are ridiculous and actually disadvantage our category by making us Henrys sound ridiculous.    

¬£100k in London as a single earner affords you a very comfortable lifestyle and thinking the opposite is pretty crazy and above all extremely disrespectful to the >50% of people in London that earn less than half that.    

It is true that we had inflation, but guess what, even if you made ¬£30k you‚Äôd have experienced that, with the  difference that it is not ‚Äòbiting your disposable income‚Äô.   
       
Many young professionals choose to dine out a lot and go on a lot of vacations but it can hardly be argued that they should be entitled to that and to save at the same time. Also, when people say ‚Äòit does not go as far as it used to‚Äô I believe boomers/genX on comparable incomes back then did not jet set as I see a lot of young people do today. And I believe they did not eat out as much.
        

Here is a lavish ¬£100k breakdown:
Take home ¬£5700:
- 1 bed rent zone 1 ¬£2200
- bills ¬£300 (council, water, gas, electric, phone)
- good food (Waitrose + markets) ¬£500
- coffee and work lunches ¬£400
- dining out ¬£700
- travel budget ¬£500
- beers ¬£200
- gym/sports ¬£200

Total 5000.     
You still have a LOT leftover.     
For either saving (for gods sake) or even more discretionary: pets, clothes, entertainment, clubs‚Ä¶..       
       
This is very lax, I myself spend way less than that, so don‚Äôt come here saying ‚Äòbut then you don‚Äôt have enough to save‚Äô cause saving should be a choice, cut some of that crazy spending above.     
      
Pretty crazy to think this is not a comfortable lifestyle.   
    
People that don‚Äôt think this is comfortable deserve the hatred and the ridicule of the majority of the population. With this attitude we will never become a politically relevant group.

EDIT: I think a lot of people missed the point that the budget above is lavish and you should not be entitled to save aggressively on top of it. You need to choose: spend like a degenerate or save.   
I am not British and don‚Äôt drink beer, but added that so as to not get destroyed in the comments by the British. I guess you will complain no matter what ahah",134,1751453475.0,HENRYUK,163,0.68,False

In the quiet corner of a caf√© ‚Äî where revolutions have always found their first whispers ‚Äî a solitary cup of coffee sits beside an ashtray of half-burnt promises and a pack of Marlboros waiting to feed the next thought.
It is here, between the rising smoke and the gentle hum of soft conversations, that ideas of power, loyalty, and betrayal swirl like steam above the rim. The cup, warm in hand, tastes of small victories and necessary compromises ‚Äî a moment of satisfaction before stepping back into a world where alliances shift like cigarette ash in the wind.
Each stubbed-out cigarette marks a pause, a question, a truth spoken or swallowed. The lighter gleams like a torch ‚Äî ready to ignite not just tobacco but intentions waiting to catch fire.
This table is a parliament of one, where a single mind weighs promises against reality, dreams against deals, romance against reason ‚Äî and finds a fleeting peace in the bitter sweetness of coffee and the burn of a cigarette.
Here, politics is not in speeches or crowds, but in the quiet certainty that sometimes the world is changed by those who sit alone, lost in thought, satisfied ‚Äî yet always restless for what must come next.

1lpso9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1lpso9c/what_is_this/,What is this?,"Hey Reddit, I (38m) am seeking advice on a complex situation with a former colleague,  (F36). We've developed a very deep connection, but I'm struggling to interpret her actions, especially with her recent silence.

Our Background:
 * Early 2024 - Nov 2024: Casual office conversations gradually became deeper and more personal. I developed stronger feelings around Nov 2024 when she mentioned moving out to another suburb so would be in the office less.

Feb 2025: I resigned (stayed on as contractor). When I told her, she was shocked. I said I'd miss our talks, she said ""me too."" I started initiating more direct communication via MS Teams (she always replied quickly and warmly).

 Feb - May 2025: Frequent emotional conversations. She shared deep struggles (work-life balance, wanting to quit, anxiety, family dynamics) 

 * Meeting Outside Work: I initiated twice in her suburb; she was away but always proposed alternatives at work, which we did (walks/chats, warm open body language).

 * April 19, 2025: After a tough day for her, I sent her my personal number (via Teams, making a light joke about HR policies). Her reply: ""Thanks! And no. It means a lot, hope you have a great weekend."" She never used my number until June 3rd.

 * My Personal Life: (Context: I'm married with a 5yo daughter, which she knew). In April, I disclosed my marriage was effectively over (separated last Aug, co-parenting, living together for daughter's sake until lease ends Oct). I said ""not many people know, facades still up and working 9ut logistics.

The ""Speech"" (Late May):
I expressed on one of out walks how our talks felt ""different... really calm. Really real,"" and that I felt ""more like myself."" I clarified my home situation again about the coparenting. My intent was honesty, no pressure, but ""if staying in touch ever felt right... I'd honestly really welcome that.""

 She jumped in to say she was ""seeing someone and apologised for not mentioning it sooner, then quickly clarified ""early stages."" (This person has never been mentioned again by her).

 She also said after: ""I felt it was coming"" (we laughed, but left me wondering why she didn't shut it down earlier if only platonic).

 Disclosed her longest relationship was a year. Asked my marriage length.

 Emotional tone remained soft and open. No pullback.

Post-Speech Interactions:
 May 28: She initiated a walk. Shared warm conversation, but ""the speech"" wasn't mentioned. Felt a closer, more intimate vibe. She referenced a memory of me checking on her 5 months prior when she was going through a really tough day.
 
 June 3/4 (My Last Day as a contractor at her workplace): She finally texted me on my personal number on my last day hoping id have a great last day, and clarified it was her. We exchanged warm texts. I said that I really enjoyed our time together and she replied "" I feel the same and you will really be missed""

 * June 5 (Farewell Drinks): She attended. My text post-drinks: ""Thank you for coming... means a lot."" Her reply: ‚ù§Ô∏è emoji, ""of course... not a real goodbye - we should definitely stay in touch :)""

 * June 6 (My Last Reply): Mentioned respecting her honesty and wanting to keep in touch ""any way/time that is comfortable."" No reply until June 11.

 * June 11-19 (Texts): Light, warm exchanges, she initiated asking if I was back in home after being away camping, and she then proposed a walk/run that coming Sunday in my suburb as she would be in the area (this was the Monday before. I was busy but proposed following Sunday. No reply.

 * June 19 (My Hiking Suggestion): I suggested a challenging hike. Her reply: ""I like your thinking... Maybe we could start with the Park next weekend and work our way up to that? üòÇ"" (Indicating she still wanted to meet up and take a less intense step).

 * June 22: We confirmed The Park.
 * June 28 (The Park Meet-up): We met up for 4 hours. Walked, then coffee, then walked more. She set a very slow, unhurried pace, so slow that she stumbled or would stop at times whilst we talked.

   * Conversations: Deepest disclosures yet: work unhappiness, insecurities, family dynamics ( about her dad and disliking him), past anxiety, yoga. She disclosed she keeps personal issues very close (even from family) and only really shared in relationships.

   * Body Language: Lots of shared eye contact, open posture, within arm's distance. I subtly touched her shoulder twice, she subtly touched my arm once.

   * The ""Eye Lock"": At one point, we locked eyes. It lasted ""longer than normal... due to no talking we both showed warmth and a smile.""

   * Her Curiosity: She asked about my plans for next 6 months (sat up, playful tone). I spoke about my marriage/daughter, she seemed interested.

   * Coworker Anecdote: She mentioned a coworker who got together with another coworker after one quit (tone slightly changed).

   * Future Plans: She asked what music I like, said she'd look up something for us to go to, would look in my area (where she works/I live), or meet halfway in the city.

   * End of Meet-up: Hugged. She said she's ""so glad we've stayed on as friends after I've left and met up."" No mention of the person she was ""seeing.""

My Last Message (June 29, 10:30 AM, next day after Park meet-up):
""Hey there, Yesterday was really lovely, thank you for being there and just being you as always ‚ò∫Ô∏è Time always seems to disappear when we catch up. I didn‚Äôt even realise how late I was until we hit the pillars again‚Ä¶ and I never even asked what your favourite music is! üò¨ What are your current top 4 songs getting the most attention? I‚Äôm ruling out K-pop and goth‚Ä¶ but maybe some old-school 80s/90s bangers? Anyway, you know how I feel, hopefully we keep finding moments to meet, or at least excuses to keep the lines open, so we don‚Äôt become just another statistic of good intentions lost in the noise of life ‚ò∫Ô∏è Hope you‚Äôve had a nice, relaxing Sunday. Cheers, ""

So my question is, 

what do you think of this dynamic? Is it more than platonic?

Is she really seeing someone if she initiated this walk, and spent so much time and shared so much deep detail?

Her replies in the past have been consistently slow by days at a time, however when she does reply its always warm and no cause for concern, how do you interpret the current silence since my last text? 

I am going a but crazy, just because our history and the fact that it feels like something is nit right, like we both know there is more but are frozen, most of her traits point to fearful avoidant/reserved personality but she does open up and thing shes extroverted, however at work she very much kept to herself and it was noticed by others that I was the one that she spoke to openly the most.

Kendu is a memecoin that is focused entirely on community, we do not pay KOLs or rely on any ""team"", we all push in all directions, to build Kendu both as a brand and a coin. Kendu has an insane range of IRL products whilst also not slacking on the social media realm. Kendu is also extremely battle tested, redistribution can either make or break a community and it has made Kendu, we have been brought closer than ever. A lot of coins are gonna really take a massive hit when passing major milestones like 100 million mc, but not Kendu.

**Kendu's IRL Range**

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press¬†
* Kendu Hand Cream

**Kendu's Social Media Efforts and Why Community is Everything**

Kendu is the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, Pepe is the only other coin to ever manage this insane achievement. Certik rates Kendu's community at 92.85, whilst I haven't seen another coin above 90, never mind above 90 and under 25 million market cap. Community is the most important aspect and Kendu has it in bags, Kendu's twitter efforts rival the very best and our Reddit efforts are unparalleled. Check any memecoin subreddit and you will see Kendu everywhere. Due to these efforts, there will be so much FOMO at the first sign of green since everyone knows about Kendu, we seen this when we pumped to 40 million the other week. It is very hard on a communities morale during these tough and trying times, however Kendu's morale is not dampened. We push hard no matter the outside market conditions because we know any work now just adds fuel to the fire. The fact that Kendu is producing an unparalleled level of IRL products whilst also maintaining an insanely strong social media presence is unheard of, we are really upping the game forever. An IRL community is gonna be a key factor due to AI and bot usage rampant on social media, an IRL community is¬†**Proof Of Humanity**.

**Some Final Thoughts**

Join the Kendu community, we are outworking all other projects right now and we all know what happens to the most hardworking communities...... they moon..... Shib, Doge and Pepe all had die hard communities, there was nothing special about them, they just worked incredibly hard. This is NFA but Kendu has absolutely 0 risk at these levels and a hell of a lot of potential upside. My advice is to at least join our telegram and get a feel for the community, ask questions and just get involved. You literally have nothing to lose but a lot of money and connections to gain. I personally am all in on Kendu because I don't see a reason to own anything else, Kendu dominates all metrics

Chaat shot 
Pizza - paneer capsicum onion 
White sauce pasta 
Cold coffee 
Cream and onion fries 

Afterwards, we ordered two more drinks with food 
Blue magic 
Green apple 

We thought chat shot would come at first as starters but it came at last 
Pizza was good and tasty 
Pasta I felt a bit oily and too creamy üòÖ but it was fine 
The fries tasted normal. You can order salted fries, and they will taste the same.
Coffee was nice 
Chat shot was disastrous, why I am saying this because my friend and I both tasted it and they served it with 1 layer of tomato above that curd and sprinkled with namkeen. Tasted bad so we left it.

But the drinks were sooo good üíØ 
Appreciable 

I went with my female friend on Sunday 
The bill was about 1100 so we got a Zomato 10% discount

1lpsh1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1lpsh1m/anonymous_letter/,Anonymous Letter,"My spouse and I have lived in this neighborhood for over 30 years. It was a working class bordering on poor area until several years ago when gentrification hit. 
A month ago we became foster parents for 2 teens and also took in their dog until we could give him back to their mom. Their dog and our dog got along great. We  always let our dog out into our little yard before going to work at 6 a.m. so he could do his business, so we let out both dogs. Of course they played and barked.
After a week we received an anonymous letter from ""A concerned neighbor."" Our houses are all close together (old city neighborhood). The ""concerned neighbor"" lectured us about training our dogs not to bark or not letting them outside so early and disrupting the lives of people who are sleeping or trying to enjoy their morning coffee. They said, ""As you are aware, our houses are very close together in this neighborhood,"" Mind you, they chose to move here. Then they threatened to ""take legal action"" if we did not rectify the situation. We began letting the dogs out one at a time so that they wouldn't play and bark at 6 a.m. 
Years ago, if there were a problem or concern, a neighbor would have knocked on my door. 
I thought of making posters of Ms. Gulch/wicked witch on her bike with Dorothy's little dog in the basket and saying, ""Have you seen her? She wants the authorities to take my dog,"" with a little write up about the letter. However, I didn't want to risk upsetting the foster kids. A week later their mom was able to take back their dog.
Summary: We took in 2 teens in need with their dog. New dog & old dog make noise in the morning. Gentrification took away neighborly concern and brought in Karen to anonymously threaten us.",8,1751452603.0,neighborsfromhell,7,0.91,False

1lpse60,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lpse60/what_is_this/,What is this,"I (38m) am seeking advice on a complex situation with a former colleague,  (F36). We've developed a very deep connection, but I'm struggling to interpret her actions, especially with her recent silence.

Our Background:
 * Early 2024 - Nov 2024: Casual office conversations gradually became deeper and more personal. I developed stronger feelings around Nov 2024 when she mentioned moving out to another suburb so would be in the office less.

Feb 2025: I resigned (stayed on as contractor). When I told her, she was shocked. I said I'd miss our talks, she said ""me too."" I started initiating more direct communication via MS Teams (she always replied quickly and warmly).

 Feb - May 2025: Frequent emotional conversations. She shared deep struggles (work-life balance, wanting to quit, anxiety, family dynamics) 

 * Meeting Outside Work: I initiated twice in her suburb; she was away but always proposed alternatives at work, which we did (walks/chats, warm open body language).

 * April 19, 2025: After a tough day for her, I sent her my personal number (via Teams, making a light joke about HR policies). Her reply: ""Thanks! And no. It means a lot, hope you have a great weekend."" She never used my number until June 3rd.

 * My Personal Life: (Context: I'm married with a 5yo daughter, which she knew). In April, I disclosed my marriage was effectively over (separated last Aug, co-parenting, living together for daughter's sake until lease ends Oct). I said ""not many people know, facades still up and working 9ut logistics.

The ""Speech"" (Late May):
I expressed on one of out walks how our talks felt ""different... really calm. Really real,"" and that I felt ""more like myself."" I clarified my home situation again about the coparenting. My intent was honesty, no pressure, but ""if staying in touch ever felt right... I'd honestly really welcome that.""

 She jumped in to say she was ""seeing someone and apologised for not mentioning it sooner, then quickly clarified ""early stages."" (This person has never been mentioned again by her).

 She also said after: ""I felt it was coming"" (we laughed, but left me wondering why she didn't shut it down earlier if only platonic).

 Disclosed her longest relationship was a year. Asked my marriage length.

 Emotional tone remained soft and open. No pullback.

Post-Speech Interactions:
 May 28: She initiated a walk. Shared warm conversation, but ""the speech"" wasn't mentioned. Felt a closer, more intimate vibe. She referenced a memory of me checking on her 5 months prior when she was going through a really tough day.
 
 June 3/4 (My Last Day as a contractor at her workplace): She finally texted me on my personal number on my last day hoping id have a great last day, and clarified it was her. We exchanged warm texts. I said that I really enjoyed our time together and she replied "" I feel the same and you will really be missed""

 * June 5 (Farewell Drinks): She attended. My text post-drinks: ""Thank you for coming... means a lot."" Her reply: ‚ù§Ô∏è emoji, ""of course... not a real goodbye - we should definitely stay in touch :)""

 * June 6 (My Last Reply): Mentioned respecting her honesty and wanting to keep in touch ""any way/time that is comfortable."" No reply until June 11.

 * June 11-19 (Texts): Light, warm exchanges, she initiated asking if I was back in home after being away camping, and she then proposed a walk/run that coming Sunday in my suburb as she would be in the area (this was the Monday before. I was busy but proposed following Sunday. No reply.

 * June 19 (My Hiking Suggestion): I suggested a challenging hike. Her reply: ""I like your thinking... Maybe we could start with the Park next weekend and work our way up to that? üòÇ"" (Indicating she still wanted to meet up and take a less intense step).

 * June 22: We confirmed The Park.
 * June 28 (The Park Meet-up): We met up for 4 hours. Walked, then coffee, then walked more. She set a very slow, unhurried pace, so slow that she stumbled or would stop at times whilst we talked.

   * Conversations: Deepest disclosures yet: work unhappiness, insecurities, family dynamics ( about her dad and disliking him), past anxiety, yoga. She disclosed she keeps personal issues very close (even from family) and only really shared in relationships.

   * Body Language: Lots of shared eye contact, open posture, within arm's distance. I subtly touched her shoulder twice, she subtly touched my arm once.

   * The ""Eye Lock"": At one point, we locked eyes. It lasted ""longer than normal... due to no talking we both showed warmth and a smile.""

   * Her Curiosity: She asked about my plans for next 6 months (sat up, playful tone). I spoke about my marriage/daughter, she seemed interested.

   * Coworker Anecdote: She mentioned a coworker who got together with another coworker after one quit (tone slightly changed).

   * Future Plans: She asked what music I like, said she'd look up something for us to go to, would look in my area (where she works/I live), or meet halfway in the city.

   * End of Meet-up: Hugged. She said she's ""so glad we've stayed on as friends after I've left and met up."" No mention of the person she was ""seeing.""

My Last Message (June 29, 10:30 AM, after Park meet-up):
""Hey there, Yesterday was really lovely, thank you for being there and just being you as always ‚ò∫Ô∏è Time always seems to disappear when we catch up. I didn‚Äôt even realise how late I was until we hit the pillars again‚Ä¶ and I never even asked what your favourite music is! üò¨ What are your current top 4 songs getting the most attention? I‚Äôm ruling out K-pop and goth‚Ä¶ but maybe some old-school 80s/90s bangers? Anyway, you know how I feel, hopefully we keep finding moments to meet, or at least excuses to keep the lines open, so we don‚Äôt become just another statistic of good intentions lost in the noise of life ‚ò∫Ô∏è Hope you‚Äôve had a nice, relaxing Sunday. Cheers, ""

So my question is, 

what do you think of this dynamic? Is it more than platonic?

Is she really seeing someone if she initiated this walk, and spent so much time and shared so much deep detail?

Her replies in the past have been consistently slow by days at a time, however when she does reply its always warm and no cause for concern, how do you interpret the current silence since my last text? 

I am going a but crazy, just because our history and the fact that it feels like something is nit right, like we both know there is more but are frozen, most of her traits point to fearful avoidant/reserved personality but she does open up and thing shes extroverted, however at work she very much kept to herself and it was noticed by others that I was the one that she spoke to openly the most.

1lpsd6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lpsd6o/what_is_this/,What is this,"Hey Reddit, I (38m) am seeking advice on a complex situation with a former colleague,  (F36). We've developed a very deep connection, but I'm struggling to interpret her actions, especially with her recent silence.

Our Background:
 * Early 2024 - Nov 2024: Casual office conversations gradually became deeper and more personal. I developed stronger feelings around Nov 2024 when she mentioned moving out to another suburb so would be in the office less.

Feb 2025: I resigned (stayed on as contractor). When I told her, she was shocked. I said I'd miss our talks, she said ""me too."" I started initiating more direct communication via MS Teams (she always replied quickly and warmly).

 Feb - May 2025: Frequent emotional conversations. She shared deep struggles (work-life balance, wanting to quit, anxiety, family dynamics) 

 * Meeting Outside Work: I initiated twice in her suburb; she was away but always proposed alternatives at work, which we did (walks/chats, warm open body language).

 * April 19, 2025: After a tough day for her, I sent her my personal number (via Teams, making a light joke about HR policies). Her reply: ""Thanks! And no. It means a lot, hope you have a great weekend."" She never used my number until June 3rd.

 * My Personal Life: (Context: I'm married with a 5yo daughter, which she knew). In April, I disclosed my marriage was effectively over (separated last Aug, co-parenting, living together for daughter's sake until lease ends Oct). I said ""not many people know, facades still up and working 9ut logistics.

The ""Speech"" (Late May):
I expressed on one of out walks how our talks felt ""different... really calm. Really real,"" and that I felt ""more like myself."" I clarified my home situation again about the coparenting. My intent was honesty, no pressure, but ""if staying in touch ever felt right... I'd honestly really welcome that.""

 She jumped in to say she was ""seeing someone and apologised for not mentioning it sooner, then quickly clarified ""early stages."" (This person has never been mentioned again by her).

 She also said after: ""I felt it was coming"" (we laughed, but left me wondering why she didn't shut it down earlier if only platonic).

 Disclosed her longest relationship was a year. Asked my marriage length.

 Emotional tone remained soft and open. No pullback.

Post-Speech Interactions:
 May 28: She initiated a walk. Shared warm conversation, but ""the speech"" wasn't mentioned. Felt a closer, more intimate vibe. She referenced a memory of me checking on her 5 months prior when she was going through a really tough day.
 
 June 3/4 (My Last Day as a contractor at her workplace): She finally texted me on my personal number on my last day hoping id have a great last day, and clarified it was her. We exchanged warm texts. I said that I really enjoyed our time together and she replied "" I feel the same and you will really be missed""

 * June 5 (Farewell Drinks): She attended. My text post-drinks: ""Thank you for coming... means a lot."" Her reply: ‚ù§Ô∏è emoji, ""of course... not a real goodbye - we should definitely stay in touch :)""

 * June 6 (My Last Reply): Mentioned respecting her honesty and wanting to keep in touch ""any way/time that is comfortable."" No reply until June 11.

 * June 11-19 (Texts): Light, warm exchanges, she initiated asking if I was back in home after being away camping, and she then proposed a walk/run that coming Sunday in my suburb as she would be in the area (this was the Monday before. I was busy but proposed following Sunday. No reply.

 * June 19 (My Hiking Suggestion): I suggested a challenging hike. Her reply: ""I like your thinking... Maybe we could start with the Park next weekend and work our way up to that? üòÇ"" (Indicating she still wanted to meet up and take a less intense step).

 * June 22: We confirmed The Park.
 * June 28 (The Park Meet-up): We met up for 4 hours. Walked, then coffee, then walked more. She set a very slow, unhurried pace, so slow that she stumbled or would stop at times whilst we talked.

   * Conversations: Deepest disclosures yet: work unhappiness, insecurities, family dynamics ( about her dad and disliking him), past anxiety, yoga. She disclosed she keeps personal issues very close (even from family) and only really shared in relationships.

   * Body Language: Lots of shared eye contact, open posture, within arm's distance. I subtly touched her shoulder twice, she subtly touched my arm once.

   * The ""Eye Lock"": At one point, we locked eyes. It lasted ""longer than normal... due to no talking we both showed warmth and a smile.""

   * Her Curiosity: She asked about my plans for next 6 months (sat up, playful tone). I spoke about my marriage/daughter, she seemed interested.

   * Coworker Anecdote: She mentioned a coworker who got together with another coworker after one quit (tone slightly changed).

   * Future Plans: She asked what music I like, said she'd look up something for us to go to, would look in my area (where she works/I live), or meet halfway in the city.

   * End of Meet-up: Hugged. She said she's ""so glad we've stayed on as friends after I've left and met up."" No mention of the person she was ""seeing.""

My Last Message (June 29, 10:30 AM, after Park meet-up):
""Hey there, Yesterday was really lovely, thank you for being there and just being you as always ‚ò∫Ô∏è Time always seems to disappear when we catch up. I didn‚Äôt even realise how late I was until we hit the pillars again‚Ä¶ and I never even asked what your favourite music is! üò¨ What are your current top 4 songs getting the most attention? I‚Äôm ruling out K-pop and goth‚Ä¶ but maybe some old-school 80s/90s bangers? Anyway, you know how I feel, hopefully we keep finding moments to meet, or at least excuses to keep the lines open, so we don‚Äôt become just another statistic of good intentions lost in the noise of life ‚ò∫Ô∏è Hope you‚Äôve had a nice, relaxing Sunday. Cheers, ""

So my question is, 

what do you think of this dynamic? Is it more than platonic?

Is she really seeing someone if she initiated this walk, and spent so much time and shared so much deep detail?

Her replies in the past have been consistently slow by days at a time, however when she does reply its always warm and no cause for concern, how do you interpret the current silence since my last text? 

I am going a but crazy, just because our history and the fact that it feels like something is nit right, like we both know there is more but are frozen, most of her traits point to fearful avoidant/reserved personality but she does open up and thing shes extroverted, however at work she very much kept to herself and it was noticed by others that I was the one that she spoke to openly the most.
