1javfgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1javfgf/7_days_vape_free/,7 days vape free!!,"i had been vaping for over two years. 
it originally was just to have something for events where i would have social anxiety but then became and habit and since i work from home, i found myself vaping constantly. i had been wanting to quit the last several months but definitely was at the top of my new year’s resolution and this was due to painful trapped gas or air in my chest to where it was getting hard for me to sleep peacefully. 

 i was mentally ready to quit to but i couldn’t. the cravings were too intense. i would be shaking if i didn’t have my vape every 30-40 mins 🥲 there were times i would forget to charge it or could t get to it quick enough that i would literally be having a mental breakdown. i was so embarrassed of myself. 

well, i got sick last week with covid to where i could tell i was getting worse only because i was still vaping. i was taking medicine but my addicted self was vaping through covid!!! well, i got sooo sick where i couldn’t even vape. my chest, my lungs, my cough, truly couldnt take it. i couldn’t inhale or breathe.

my sickness got so bad, at one point i felt so cold and could barely breathe through both my mouth and nose so i sat in front of a heater crying for two hours. during that time i didn’t pick up my vape that whole time. it shook me! i said okay im too exhausted and stressed and sick im going to bed now and wont hit my vape. 

i felt soooo good waking up. i felt my symptoms had improved as well because i didnt vape. i didnt even care to hit it as soon as i woke up. i went on about two days and didnt have any cravings. at this point i was thanking covid and whoever gave it to me because though i was suffering i was so happy to finally have something to keep me from this habit. this felt so good . i was 48 hours in, i felt better, sleeping better, no chest pains from trapped gas. lets do this. let’s officially quit. 

day three . 72 hours in. no one prepared me for. my symptoms were much better so i actually could breathe a little better. i wasn’t in a weird head fog place from being sick and rotting away. i wasn’t getting my energy back but the cravings were so intense so much!! the mood swings, the irritation, the anger, the despair loll! it was so hard but i said i am not giving in and i was just so embarrassed that i was shaking and losing my mind without that stupid vape!!! i used to smoke cigarettes and never got this down bad before. vapes are the worst. i could smoke maybe 6 cigarettes a day. i could imagine i smoked probably 40+ cigarettes a day in terms of how many vape hits i took. 

i am 7 days in!!! thank you covid loll!! but also the cravings have gotten so much easier. the last two days have been way better. i keep telling myself i never want anything to have this kinda control over me ever again. i will keep going. the initial withdrawals were so bad because my body was just trying to adjust. and it was. 

now i am a week vape free and i know i will never go back! i still get cravings but not as bad. its always after drinking coffee so i am kinda avoiding any triggers like that which sucks but i feel so much better. i also am using the quit vaping app and finch app to keep me through. distracting my brain, drinking tasty drinks and water. doing whatever i can!  good luck and thank you!! i am really proud and wanted to share!!

Sometimes they'll rant for 20 minutes or longer. 

On one occasion, a baker who works overnights with us was in tears talking about her financial struggles and the shitty way this company treats her.  On another occasion, one worker was so mad his hours got cut, he knocked some bags of coffee off the shelf and was ready to walk out the door for good, but I told him to take a smoke break and really think about it since he had lots of credit card debt and really needed a steady stream of income.  He calmed down and stayed.

I sometimes joke that I should get a second paycheck as the store's psychiatrist.  I have seen so much mental abuse from this company and the other grocery chain I worked for.  If we were truly valued, these horror stories wouldn't happen.

1jav9v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jav9v5/need_help_navigating_a_potential_breakup_i_want/,Need help navigating a potential breakup. I want to save it but it seems unlikely,"I'm a 32M gf is 27F
Throwaway account. My gf and I have been seeing each other for a year and 3 months and spent almost every day together (unless we had our own family/work stuff to deal with.) I live about 7 mins away paying mortgage at my house with a couple roommates and she lives in a rental duplex situation. Sometimes she drives over to pick me up after work.

She started feeling sick for a couple days with some kind of cold so she was generally ornery and didn't want to interact much. On the third day of this, she says she wants to go see a doctor and asks if she could take me home early. She says on the way back to my house that she wants some space or alone time because she's an introvert and needs time to recharge.

This felt like it came out of nowhere and being in other relationships previously where this usually means, I want space until I've decided I'm completely done with you. The insecurities and anxiety inside started taking over. I tried just minimally texting and still ended up helping her out by going to her house while she was working to drop off some carrot cake and do some chores for her to make it easier on her. We exchanged the occasional I love yous but she didn't really reciprocate missing me much.

This is where I started fucking up really bad. I asked if it was okay if I could come over after the third day of not seeing her and she responded that she wasn't sure, then I asked her to specify and she just said she didn't know. I left it at that at the time, but 4 hours later I proceeded to drive over after she was off from work at 12:30 am to be with her. When I showed up she even said that I scared her and I apologized, we cuddled and went to sleep after watching some shows.

The next morning she has a killer headache and asks me to make coffee while she goes to take a shower. I feel like at this point I really fucked up, so instead of doing the right thing and talking to her about it, I (like an idiot) go through her phone to see if she was mentioning anything to her sister about the whole situation of needing space with me. I immediately felt a hot wash of shame and closed it after a couple seconds regretting what I did, and started doing more chores feeling guilty while she tried to feel better.

When she gets out she plays a game alone, I mention something wrong with my computer and try to play it off non-chalantly, obviously ashamed of what I did. Then the clincher: she noticed I went through her phone based on how she left it and how it was slightly off. She questions me about it, and initially I lie saying that I didn't go through it. She pushes further and I come clean saying honestly that I felt insecure about the current situation so I looked. She asks me to leave.

I apologize (improperly, just saying im really sorry and not really explaining the mistake or how to improve) and proceed to have a total breakdown saying that it wasn't that I didn't trust her but I was just looking for answers in her conversations with her sister that she tells everything to since she wasn't telling me anything other than shes an introvert. She didn't even say anything ti her sister about it. She says I could have communicated with her about it but everytime I did she wouldn't give me a straight answer or just revert to saying she's an introvert and wanted her own space. This alone was truth enough to show me how much of an asshole I was. We exchanged I love yous, I hugged her, and I left.

A day later I say sorry and want to apologize in person properly. She says maybe in a few days and I agree to it, and say if she needs more time then take your time.

We don't text or talk or see eachother for 2 days. 3rd day I just ask how she's doing, she says she has a headache, I say it sucks and hope she feels better. Later on I offer to help her at work to ease her load.

She says no thank you. I don't mean to be rude or to have any misunderstanding, but please don't come over tonight or ever come over uninvited. I say I understand and if she doesn't want me to talk to her until she's ready to talk then it wouldn't be rude of her to say that either.

At this point can I even do anything to save this relationship? Did I just solidify the end by betraying her respect and trust in one fell swoop? 

I figure that the best thing to do is just give her the space and time to respond to me when she's ready but idk what else to do. I wrote out a full apology explaining my mistakes, starting with disrespecting her need for space and lack of communication on how I felt. Then the violation of her privacy and audacity to lie to cover it up. 

I'm beyond ashamed and remorseful for what I've done and I feel like she doesn't even want to hear it. I've even begun mourning the end of the relationship as if it's ended since I feel like I've effectively ended it on my own by being an insecure mess. Any advice at this point would help but I already feel like I've messed up to the point where it's just going to be confirmation that I totally messed this whole thing up.

TL;DR, how do I save a relationship I messed up badly and gf doesn't want to talk in person about it?

Here's what I got: this is my first time trying ube matcha and decided to give it a go because I was drawn to the color combination and got it with almond milk. The matcha was the perfect color and the ube cream complemented the matcha fairly. Although I was excited to try this drink out I was scared that the ube cream would overpower the matcha and would sweeten it. This was not the case it was actually pretty good for my first time trying ube matcha and even though I have nothing to compare it to, I was hoping there would be a bit more to it like more matcha flavor.

Here’s what my friend had to say about his drink: I got a medium mocha with two extra shots of mocha at the gold bean cafe. The mocha was actually really good and I enjoyed my time consuming it, but I believe that the cup that my mocha came in is too small for it to be considered medium, now if I would have known I was going to get a small cup I would have ordered a larger cup but also the coffee was little too expensive for it to be this small and not even be a medium. The mocha itself was really good and I would come back again for some more but how money is as a college student I don’t think I will be coming back to this establishment because I could simply get a better size flavored mocha from a cheaper coffee shop such as strada, I enjoyed drinking the bit of coffee I had and the company for my friend as well :)",5,1741924011.0,berkeley,0,0.86,False

Some Asian guy came up to me asking me questions about my religion, and was saying he's conducting some survey about religion in Adelaide. He then proceeds to make me follow him down North Terrace talking about some weekly Saturday event about reviving your faith??

This dude even got my number and called it just to make sure it was mine so we could ""meet up for a coffee"" (I know, stupid move, but I've blocked it now)

I think I got sucked into feeling like ""Ah alright I won't be rude to them and just let them talk"". Then after the interaction, I felt a bit weirded out. Got a few text messages after that saying ""Nice to meet you today"" ""What did you get up to afterwards?""

I was about to say to him at one point as we had crossed over North Terrace, ""I don't mean to be rude but I've gotta run and catch my bus now"" but we just kept walking down to the railway station...

This is just another reason why I hate being nice to people anymore. Because people take advantage of it. It's actually completely embarrassing to me that I could get scammed like this, because I can always see right through people's fakeness. The ones who are gonna say ""Just stand up and tell them to fuck off"" couldn't be any more correct.. I won't allow this to happen to me again.

I've gained so much weight because of the other complications and not movng, and now the scale after 8 - 9 weeks of steady working out will not budge. 

  
TLDR: T1 (F29) gained \~25 pounds, High BS all day, then lows in the evening and forgoes calorie deficit while working out because of consumption. Any help / suggestions? ",3,1741923086.0,Type1Diabetes,1,1.0,False

I remember it being called something like Roasted Chicken and rice or something similar. It had mushrooms and was darker brown than any chicken and rice soup I’ve ever seen, almost like a gravy and in my memory it was similar in color to the Campbell golden mushroom soup if you’ve seen the cans. The jagoff who ran the coffee shop wouldn’t tell me where they ordered it from and it’s been plaguing me for years. I’m wondering if anyone remembers this but me?

1jaurw9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jaurw9,Troubleshooting help,"Disclaimer: This is my first time ever attempting large format photography. So a little bit of trial and error is going to be needed.

But anyway, I shot a few photos of Ilford Direct Positive Photographic Paper with a Graflex Super Graphic 4x5 Film Camera. All film holders were 4x5 Lisco Film Holders, everything seemed to be light tight, and the shutter on the camera was operating correctly. Nothing seemed to be wrong with that setup.

As for developer, I used caffanol c recipe I use for my black and white film. Slightly modified because I was using a Yankee agitank which calls for 55 oz of developer. The recipe is
1000 ml water, 15 g instant coffee, 6g soda and 3g  vit C, And 4 g. Iodized salt in place of potassium bromide for fog restrainer. Temp was 20 C. I doubled this recipe to make 2 l of this developer. Fixer was just my normal ilford  rapid fixer And it's pretty new so it wasn't exhausted. I also used tap water not distilled water. 

The little bit of pink emulsion left over  I'm pretty sure was due to me not having enough fixer which kind of left the areas that weren't being submerged behind. 

It seems as though the emulsion was completely washed away and the only thing I could think of was it being too basic because of tap water or too much soda but other than that, I'm not sure what else it could possibly be. I want to try it again, but I definitely want to know what to avoid for the next go-around. Thank you for any help that you guys may have to offer!!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jaurcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1jaurcj/stroll_through_a_lonely_mind/,Stroll through a lonely mind,"I dont mind going to a restaurant by myself. In fact I am currently sitting in a cafe, eating a tasty bagel, sipping my iced coffee watching people passing by on the street as I stare out the glass screen seperating me from the life outside. Typing away, not quite listening to the soft background music and lost in my thoughts. Quite the pleasant scene. 

Quite the plesant scene if it wasnt for the fact that this invisible screen between me and the outside world is more than just a slightly dirty cafe window. Its this wall inside. Always keeping me a little bit seperate from everything happening around me. I can see life happening. I can here peoples conversations and laughter around me. Hell I can even join in. But I’m never really a part of it. Not quite. Not fully. 

I see peoples faces and I imagine their lifes. I imagine full lifes for them. Happy lifes. Little families. Kids. Grandkids. I imagine they go to bookclub on Sundays, they meet their girfriends for brunch every third Thursday of the month. I imagine they love someone dearly. And they are loved. They have favourite movies and favourite flavours of ice cream. I imagine they have somewhere to go once they leave my line of sight. A home to go to or an errand to run. A purpose. 

I can imagine struggels for them too. What if this womans dauther was recently diagnosed with breast cancer? Or he, over there, recently lost an old friend in a tragic car crash? Or maybe not quite so dire? Maybe this old lady wishes her kids would come visit more often? Is she lonely like I am ? Or maybe a different kind of lonely? 

In my mind there are different kinds of lonely. The lucky ones and the hopeless ones. The kind where you miss the people you love and the kind where you just feel compleately and utterly alone in the world. 

And the thing about the first kind of loneliness is, it means you are a lucky person. Becasue you are used to being so surrounded by love. By family or friends, that special someone or just anyone that brings you joy. You are used to it and you don’t have it at the moment and that is what makes you feel lonely. And if you are really lucky, it’s just a momentary thing. You are momentarily this lonely because you just got some good news and there is no one close by to share it with. Maybe you are going through something hard that feels too heavy to share with those you love. Or maybe you just had to miss bookclub the last couple of Sundays because of life and now you feel like you havn’t been surrounded by a sense of belonging in a bit too long. You just have to go without your comfort level of love for a little while too long and you feel lonely because of it and so you go out and change that. You call that friend you havn’t spoken to in a bit. You visit your family a couple towns and a 45 minute drive over. You go to your local pub where you know you’ll run into at least a freindly face or two, for a quick chat, a little bit of connection. And you feel better. You are reminded that you belong somewhere. That there is a place for you in this world where you make sense. Where you fit right in. Where you matter. This is the kind of loneliness that makes us stay connected. That makes us appreciate those we love. The kind of loneliness that keeps even introverts from being total recludes. It’s a happy kind of sadness. 

Of course if this kind of loneliness goes from momentary to permanent, it’s like the world crumbles away right underneath your feet. When that friend you needed to call for a bit of support chooses not to pick up the phone anymore, because of thatnasty fight you cannot get past. If your moms mind is slipping and she cannot remember the things she used to say to you to make you feel better, that is if she can even remeber your name that day. Or that person you used to confide your deepest darkes thoughts to one day woke up and decided not they arn’t in love with you anymore and no matter how much you long to reach out, you know theres no point. 

And maybe for some people that is the point where the momentary loneliness turns into a feeling of being compleatly and utterly alone in the world. Those who’s support system isn’t large nd wide. The ones that don’t have a couple of social commitments to choose from for every day of the week. Or just those who held that one person they lost a little closer than everyone else in the world. 

But then there is another group of lonely people. Of completely and utterly alone people. And These are the ones with an invisible glass screeen between themselves and the world. The ones that are like me. 

We can call that friend we havn’t spoken to in a while. Or even the one we speak to once a week. We can go visit or moms and dads and sisters. And there might be someone that wants to care about us a little bit more than justas a friend. But none of that makes us feel less alone or more connected. Sometimes we get some temporary joy out of those interactions with whomever is trying to be part of our lifes. But sometimes it just makes us realise a bit more deeply how much we are not actually part of what everyone would think our lifes are. 

If someone saw me out of a cafe window, maybe strolling down the sidewalk having a conversation on the phone with someone or on a Sunday moring brunch date with a group of girlfriends I’ve known since highschool They would look at me and imagine a life for me that is full. Full of love and purpose and happiness. Because I would be smiling, laughting even. I would look like I am part of some sort of group or family. And I guess I am. But also I’m not. Not in the way I imagine other people to be. 

Maybe that is just me thinking the greas is always greener for everyone else. Maybe we all feel this disconnected sometimes. Or often even? Maybe everyone is just trying to keep up this illusion? Maybe we all think we need to hide and we would be less alone if we could justunderstand how truely alone each one of us is? But I don’t belive that. I really don’t want to. I want tothink that such a thing as happiness exists and that people find it. I mean I have to because otherwise what sould it be that I pray for before O go to sleep. I have to hope that what I igaine happiness to feel like is an actual thing that exists somewhere out there. For others and maybe even for lonely people like me.

What I imagine it to feel like is like connection. Like home. Like home in the smile of the person you are staring at across the table of the cafe. The person between you and the window to the oitside world. And I've glimpsed it. Not often and never for long. For me it’s fleeting. Just a quick second of happiness before it gets too good to be true and is pulled just out of reach of my for love aching heart. 

But that is exactly what makes us lonely people this completely and utterly alone in the world. We might have an idea of what it is we are missing but we can never quite reach it. It’s never quite tangible. We don’t know how to get it. No matter who is trying to make us feel less alone, only someone truely special usually can. And truely special is a rare thing isn't it? It wouldn’t be special if it wasn’t. 

It’s someone that’s not just giving us love or momentary joy. It’s a person that can give us the thing nothing else we fill our days with can give us. It’s purpose. The person that gives us the reason. The why. The person that makes it all make sense. That inspires us. That makes us not care about not being connected to the rest of the world. Someone that connects all the dots for us just by being close by. 

But oh man. Have you ever tried holding on to something so special when you have been eaten up on the inside by loneliness for years? When the hole of hoplessness you’ve dug for yourself is so deep and dark that crawling out of it takes you longer than anyone giving you a reason to is patient enough to stick around for? When you don’t have that special light to give to the person that is your special light? It’s this vicious circle that keeps us dimm and lonely and destined for staying seated behind our glass screen constantly staring out at everyone else, wondering and whishfully imagening what it must be like. ",3,1741922981.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

Have been lurking in here for a while and have seen many of these sankey drawings, and I wanted to make my own one day. I also wanted to share some of my thoughts and reflect about my recruiting process this year. I hope that this post will give some inspiration and optimism to those who need it. So, if you're interested in reading about a full zero-to-hero story, buckle in for a long read. Feel free to skip to the end for a summary of my key points. 

A little background about myself: as you can tell from the title, I'm a sophomore international student at a recognizable school. However, it didn't help that I didn't even know what the word ""internship"" was until a month or so before the end of my freshman year. That was when I started to learn more about the value of doing an internship in college and how simply going to a good school isn't enough to stand out these days. 

I submitted my first ever application on June 9, 2024. I had a scrappy resume with practically nothing on it. I had some buggy school projects/assignments in there, high school clubs/organizations I was involved in (non-technical lol), and even made a LinkedIn account for the first time. I initially thought it would be easy to land an intern position because my naive freshman mentality led me to believe that an intern is someone that just runs and grabs coffee for employees and is literally at the bottom of the positional hierarchy. I thought maybe I'd learn a few things here and there about software development from talking with the engineers that are nice enough to give you their time during their breaks or something.

Boy was I wrong. And this is my first point I want to get across—getting an internship is tough. It truly is difficult. To all of you out there who are grinding to get one, know that what you are doing is incredibly hard. I feel like this is often overlooked because we get lost in the moment and forget that recruiting for jobs is actually just PvP: for every position someone gets, they're essentially taking that opportunity away from someone else. I want to emphasize this because unfortunately, it's the ugly, harsh reality that no one likes to talk about. But this was something I wanted to put into perspective. Ask yourself, do you REALLY deserve that internship over someone else and why?

It took me about 2 months to get my first ever online assessment. By this time, I had already applied to \~200 listings and a good chunk of those were automatic rejections because they wouldn't sponsor internationals. Oh, and by the way, the OA I got was automatic. This was the second thing I learned: the job market is absolutely ruthless to non-U.S. citizens. I don't know if this is such a controversial thing to say, but again, I realized that it's just the truth. To my fellow internationals out there, know that you're playing this game on extra-extra-hard mode. But you can't afford to waste time by complaining about the rules. You have to adapt, accept it and most importantly, not make excuses.  

Around August, I got sudden flurry of (auto) online assessment invites. At the time, I didn't know they were automatic. I thought things were finally going my way because I thought I was passing the resume screens. Somehow, my resume full of high school activities was beating those with real industry experience (was what I thought). I was doing a lot of Leetcode around this time as well and was about half way through the Neetcode 150 (shoutout Neetcode). Some OAs were super hard, and I was so discouraged when I did poorly on them because I thought they were my one chance to get in and I blew it. 

Turns out, I didn't get my first interview until November. I was about \~650-700 applications in by then. When school started, I landed a research position through my university's research program, so I guess this gave me that initial second-look I needed. This is the third point: even during school, take up any (if not every) opportunity that comes your way. It can be that extra little boost that separates a good resume and a great one. I also joined a technical club and put down the work I was doing for that club on my resume as well—it was better than my high school experiences anyway.   
  
So this (phone) interview was with a smaller company, yet I was grateful to have my first interview regardless. I took it and thought it went well. I was told I'd hear back within the next week to schedule a technical interview.

I never heard back. 

It was around this time that I seriously started to feel horrible about this whole internship thing. I applied to so many postings every single day. I was balancing an academic-heavy semester simultaneously, so I was barely getting enough sleep. Maybe 5 on a good day. Meanwhile, I was hearing from my friends and classmates that they were already interviewing for big companies and some were already in the final round. I genuinely thought it was over for me, but with my sheer determination to get an internship this year, I just focused on the work. This is my fourth message: hang in there. 

It was all quiet for the rest of November, December, and January. I just kept applying, applying, and applying to more openings every single day. Then all the sudden, I kid you not, I received five interview requests in one day in February, with one of those being FAANG. And the rest is history. I got a few more throughout the month of February that I also took mainly for practice. But getting the opportunity to work at a big tech with such a high projection for career growth was too good to give up. This leads into my last point of this post: the good comes when you least expect it. 

I don't mean to act all ""mighty and heighty"" after getting this internship, but I feel like I'm now at a position where I can share some meaningful insights because I've literally been at the bottom of the bottoms and top of the tops. This process was a whole spectrum of experiences for me, but I needed the juxtaposition to appreciate the end result even more. If my message helps even just one person, I would consider my job done and wish that person the absolute best in their endeavors.    
  
Some may say that ""it's not that deep."" That's fine, I'll enjoy the fruits of my labor. I'll do what I think is best for me, and you can do the same with yourself. 

Some may also say that this culture is toxic. Actually, I agree wholeheartedly. It's unfair the way things are done here, and I wish everyone would have such amazing opportunities. But until you get to a point where you're in a position to genuinely change the process, there's no point in whining about it. Because you have to realize that there's someone out there that doesn't care about these things and just continues works anyway. 

To summarize:  
1. Recruiting for internships is hard. This is a fact you're gonna have to acknowledge, and it's important that you know it is difficult because that means the benefits are that much greater.  
2. For internationals: yes, it's extra hard for us. But for every second you're complaining and doing nothing, someone else is working. So don't make excuses. Sorry, it sounds toxic, but it's just the way it is.   
3. Do everything you can even DURING school. Join a research lab if you can. Join a project-based club. Build personal projects in your free time. This is more traditional advice but wanted to include it because it deserves another emphasis.   
4. Hang in there. Don't give up.  
5. The good comes when you least expect it. Just focus on getting the job done, day after day, and you will reap the rewards greatly.  
6. Saved the most important for last: don't neglect your health. Physically and mentally. Take care of yourself in a healthy way.",1,1741922908.0,csMajors,0,0.67,False

Hi everyone, I am a big iced coffee drinker. I was a bit shocked on my recent Wish cruise that they didn’t dedicated iced coffee cups, and they served my coffees in the same cup they use for the hot drinks with a thick edible straw, meaning I also could not use a lid. For lack of better words, this made my morning iced coffee a little less satisfying, as the presentation wasn’t ideal.

Is this standard across all the Disney cruise ships? I understand it may be to reduce waste or because the hot coffees are generally more popular due to the character designs, but this was something I did not anticipate since iced coffee is a basic offering.",0,1741922347.0,dcl,1,0.18,False

After a brief chat on Bumble, we decided to move to WhatsApp since he isn’t on the app much.

I asked him what made him swipe right on me and what he’s looking for. He said it was my humor in my bio, my smile, and the things I wrote. He also mentioned that he’s looking for an adventurous woman who’s excited to join him in the next chapter of life.

He planned our first meeting for Sunday morning at 10:00 AM. The plan includes coffee, a salon/spa, a massage, and lunch. He also offered to book and pay for my Grab ride to our meeting place, even though I can do it myself.

This will be our first time meeting in person. He travels back and forth for work every month, staying here for two weeks or slightly longer each time. We’re both excited to meet and get to know each other better.

I’m a working professional, a Registered Nurse and EMT working in disaster response for the government. I’m only available on weekends due to my weekday work schedule. As for him, he’s the owner and head coach of a leadership company he established in Sydney, Australia. He’s also a business school professor.

I get a bit of a ""sugar daddy"" vibe from him based on some of the things he says, which make it seem like he’s subtly dropping hints.

My question is: Should I insist on paying for my own ride and splitting the costs for the activities he planned for us, even if he insists on covering everything? Or should I just let him do his thing?

I work at a coffee shop as an assistant manager. It’s one of those local ones with the unique flavors, but at a reasonable cost. There’s only two locations. It’s better than any chain coffee shop I’ve ever worked for. 

Anyways, I’m on shift but I’m handling some of the managerial duties. One of my coworkers says a guy stopped by and he wants to talk about a promotion. He says he works with teachers, but not in a school setting. I think it’s an organization or something like that. Anyways, they want to do something for teacher appreciation week. I didn’t know that was a thing. (I’m sorry, teachers.) I asked him what does he want from the shop. He says gift cards, discounts, free drinks/food, merch, and so on. He was serious. For a whole week, he expects us to give out free things. Like I said, we’re only two coffee shops. We make money, but we’re not rolling in it like Dunkin or Starbucks.

Before I could even come up with a professional response, I asked what he and his organization are doing for the teachers they work with. Also I thought, what if the teachers don’t like what we serve? What kind of appreciation is that? Finally, the audacity. 

He looked at me and asked if I could at least ask the actual manager. I told him I will. I think he already knew the answer with the unhappy face he had on his face when he asked.

I'll try to recount the plot as best as I remember it. hopefully the author didn't take it down cause I remember it being good lol.

So basically she works at a museum and she's like, a history/literature buff? And it's her first day at this museum and she's like, reciting a passage from what is likely something from classic lit, and then as she's reciting this quote this guy who also works there as a security  interjects or finishes the quote and they hit it off. Super cute. Anyway I think they have a mutual, and they bump into each other at this coffee shop that she frequents. They talk about books and whatnot and she's super passionate about classic lit and history, and he's like totally enamoured it's awesome. It's also important to note that she has an eating disorder, cause her mom is very critical of food and her appearance. It's one of the first things mentioned in the story. There's also a point in the book where she attends a gala with the security guy and gets assaulted by this dude that was a dick to her, and then it's revealed that the security man is like, a PI and he's investigating the case of I'm assuming someone he knew and was trying to avenge sort of? I'm not sure if any of this is helpful sorry y'all.

I vaguely remember the two main characters getting together and then breaking up and then she moves to Greece (?) Idk. I don't remember her name or his name or the name of the book. The name of the book is short, I think. one or two words. Has a pretty pessimistic tone in the beginning but it's not like, a dumbass book that's horribly written.

Even though we never even made out, there was some obvious unresolved sexual tension though neither of us verbally admitted it to each other. The dream interaction was definitely passionate on their end but actually kind of gross for me. 

Anyway, I hadn't thought of this person in a long time. They moved out in 2021. I get up this morning, have my coffee, and check my email. United States Postal Service sends out emails of scanned envelopes coming our way, for those who don't live in the US. And what is the one piece of mail I'm getting today but a piece of mail for the ex roommate and it's important, from the state, so not exactly something I can throw away.

I literally never get mail for them and it's a surprise it was not forwarded. I also never dream about them.  

I texted them to let them know I got the mail and gave them three choices, that I could 1) forward it to their current address if they could give it to me, 2) put 'return to sender' on it and mail it back to the state, or 3) throw it away. 

When they texted back, they offered to come by and pick it up (not one of the options given). I told them it should be in the mailbox so they can just grab it from there after the mail gets delivered, and they agreed that was fine. 

Thank God. I didn't want to see them in person after that bizarre intimate dream.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We've been checking the terrarium moisture, and misting lightly as we thought was needed... ~once every two weeks?

I realized recently that we should have been misting with distilled water (not tap) as we have hard water in our area...but haven't made the switch quite yet. (Plan to get distilled water tomorrow)

The terrarium sits on a coffee table 5-6' from a south facing window (sunny all day, but the terrarium is not in direct sunlight).

The substrate consists of terrarium soil mix, above a screen, and pebbles.

I'm assuming the white fuzz on the tree is some type of mold/fungus and am hoping the springtails will take care of issues like that...

The Springtails arrived today, (Lilac, Ceratophysella).

I'm hoping the terrarium is suitable, and ready to receive them in its current condition?

1jatz1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1jatz1a/are_all_affairs_this_intense_so_quickly/,Are all affairs this intense so quickly?,"I am a 34m and have been married for almost nine years, we have a 13 month old son. My wife is my best friend and we are still having sex, though not as frequently as before baby. I sometimes feel like we are roommates, coparenting. Admittedly, I have not taken to fatherhood  in the way I was hoping and a lot of parenting tasks fall on my wife. 

Seven weeks ago, I started an affair with a married coworker who has three kids. First affair for both. This coworker is well liked and I find her attractive. She started paying me extra attention, coming into my office regularly, hugging me before I left for the day. I invited her to walk together on lunch and she took me up on it that day. During these walks she would mostly vent about her home life, troubles with her kids and husband. She would tell me how nice and sweet I was for listening to her, she made me feel really good. I also liked that a lot of people seemingly like her, and here she was paying attention to me! She would grab my hand during these walks. The following Monday she worked, I did not. I asked is she still wanted to meet up to walk, she did and I kissed her at the end of the walk. It’s been full throttle since then.

After I kissed her, we had sex for the first time three days later. We have been having sex during lunch breaks at work. And when we are not working I make up elaborate stories to see her. Like helping my brother hang a TV. It’s all been very intense. Two weeks after we started being together she would drop weird things like “im in love with a married man.” She asked that I not refer to my wife as my wife because “it is super triggering for her” and that it makes it sound like she is the side piece. She is very against using an app to communicate because that “screams affair” we do, but she complains about it often.

A week after having sex for the first time she found a conference for me to go to so we could spend actual time together for three nights, we went after being together for 4 weeks. It was a disaster, she was drinking and smoking cigarettes the entire time. One night my wife called to say goodnight, so I stepped away to take the call when I did so AP stormed off and I came back to find AP talking to some dude at the bar. That same night she messaged me on regular iMessage instead of the usual app we use because “she forgot.” She told me she loved me on this trip and I said it back, though I do not think that is true. I love the way she makes me feel and definitely love having sex with her. On the way back from the trip she kept going on how I have to promise I will never leave her for my wife. When we got back into town she almost forgot one of her scarfs in my car but I caught it before she shut the door, additionally I found one of her lipsticks in the door of my car that she had forgotten later on. 

Since getting back from the trip two weeks ago it is like gasoline has been put on the fire. She needs a lot of reassurance and constant validation, if I am not at work with her we message all the time and if I don’t reply to her quickly she goes on about how I’m just leaving her for my wife and she can take a hint. She has made statements like “you’re probably still sleeping next to your wife” (I am), “you don’t let your wife see you naked do you?” (I do). Things of this sort. 

She said that it’s very important to see her every day so I’m making up crazy excuses to get out of the house to see her. My wife is starting to ask questions “are you feeling okay you’ve been in the bathroom a lot lately” “why didn’t you dump the coffee I made just to go buy some and not drink it” “why did it take so long to go to the store” She has also complained that I have been really disconnected and not present while home. 

My AP’s husband apparently saw our messages, she told him everything except who and he is planning to move out. Since then AP has been pressuring me to leave my wife so we can be together “for real.” I have never said I wanted to do this but I have gone along with some seriously declarations of “true love” “never feeling like this about anyone” “nothing could be more perfect than her and what we have.” AP keeps saying things like “it’ll be six months from now and you still won’t have left your wife.” 

The thing is, I never wanted to leave my wife but since getting back from our trip things have been so intense and quite frankly I’ve been an asshole to my wife and then she gets upset and I’m like “maybe I do want to leave my wife all we do is fight?!” We have started to have some serious conversations about separation and she is genuinely very concerned about me and where this is coming from and is crying a lot about how our marriage and family is worth fighting for and I can’t just give up. Our last conversation she told me that she wouldn’t hear the word divorce until we actually tried, that the first time she is hearing about a problem she is also hearing about a divorce and she wouldn’t allow that to be how our family ends. I tell my AP some select parts of these conversations to get her off my back so she can see like “see things aren’t so great at my house either.” 

AP paints a really nice picture of what being together for real would look like. That I would still see my son 50% of the time, when she had her children. Though, she has two different fathers for her kids and my son is still breastfed and has literally never not been with my wife except for the odd appointment here and there and I would have him. And when we didn’t have our kids we could just be together doing whatever we wanted. AP thinks I should just tell my wife the truth and that after some time my wife will be okay with it and we can all get along. AP does not know my wife, my wife WOULD coparent amicably because she is a really good mom and that would be what was best for our son. But, it would be a cold day in hell before she lets AP sit at her table if she knew the actual start of our relationship. My wife is also not stupid. 

I just don’t know what to do, something’s is going to give if I don’t make some serious choices. AP is laying on the pressure and wife is asking me to keep trying, if she isn’t suspicious yet, she will be soon. She has asked if there was someone else, but seemed to drop it.

1jatnkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1jatnkg/the_aries_and_pig_paradox_a_golden_retriever_soul/,The Aries and Pig Paradox: A Golden Retriever Soul in a Godzilla Body,"
I’ve noticed something interesting about my Aries friends (born between March 21 and April 19). After learning more about Eastern astrology, I realized that many of them are also Zodiac Pigs (born in 1983, 1995, 2007, or 2019). What impresses me the most is their distinct “modes” in different situations. Here are some clear examples:

	•	Social Mode: A tail-wagging Golden Retriever (when they’re with friends).
	•	Battle Mode: A fire-breathing Godzilla (when facing enemies).
	•	Everyday Mode: A Husky that just knocked over your coffee and is laughing about it (as seen by strangers).

To outsiders, they seem like born optimists—carefree, energetic, and always ready for action. But when you get closer, you might find them surprisingly grumpy. It’s not that they enjoy conflict; rather, they always seem to be in battle mode, so much so that they don’t even realize when they get hurt. However, deep down, they are extremely sensitive when it comes to their close friends.

For example, one of my friends was secretly upset for two weeks just because I casually mentioned that he could learn a little from my mom while complimenting his cookies.

The Secret Behind Their Grumpiness ⬇️

Temper tantrums ≠ Losing control

They aren’t naturally hot-tempered. Instead, they can sense when conflict is coming and prefer to take the initiative rather than passively waiting for it to happen. This gives them a sense of control. So if you ever think about dumping work on them, be prepared—they’ll probably pick a fight with you before you even finish your sentence.

The Oddly Detailed Memory ⬇️

Aries-Pigs might forget your birthday—especially if you never made a big deal about it. But they will absolutely remember that three years ago, at a random get-together, you mentioned that you don’t like onions.

Do you have a friend like this? Are they an Aries or a Zodiac Pig?

Backstory: started exercising in college when I was like 19, weighing around 145-148lbs. Started with the elliptical a few days a week and lost probably 10 pounds, then it started to bother my knees so I switched to the treadmill and did fast pace walking at a high incline for an hour, 4-6 days a week and was down to 122lbs by the time I was 21. Stayed doing this routine the rest of college, and eventually went back up and was maintaining around 125-127lbs. (Also didn’t really change my diet during any of this- snacked a lot during the day on goldfish, pretzels, fruit, yogurt, etc., ate out dinner a few nights a week, went out most Friday’s and Saturday’s and was drinking beer and sugary mixed vodka drinks.)
Fast forward to being out of college with a full time M-F job, switched from treadmill to the insanity workouts, getting in a few less days a week for exercise but maintaining weight 127-128lbs. Same diet, but less eating out because living at home and my parents cook dinner most nights, and less alcohol. Have maintained that weight up until the past year or two I creeped up a few pounds to 131 at first, then now it fluctuates from 133 to 137. I hate this weight. I am pear shaped unfortunately so I have a small waist, big butt and big thighs, and my clothes are not fitting the same in the legs, and there is fat around my hips that didn’t used to be there, but my waist is the same. Previously my measurements were 33 bust, 24-25 waist, 38.5 hips. Now the first two are the same but hips 39-40 🫠
So I look at what I’m doing and realize I had really fallen down to 2 days a week of exercise for a good while, plus was getting Starbucks coffee and breakfast 2-3 times a week, so the last 3 months I started tracking calories, eating better, cut out Starbucks completely and really pushing for getting 3 days a week of working out. 
HOWEVER. Nothing is happening. I gave up on the calorie tracking a week or two ago because literally zero weight change. Is the difference between 3 and 4 days a week of exercise really that big of a difference? Or is this because I’m pushing 30 now so hormones are different and causing these terrible changes? Or is it my age now requiring a bigger diet change? Pls help 🥲",1,1741919163.0,PetiteFitness,3,1.0,False

Here we go again! Posting another R4R—last time, my inbox got flooded and I couldn’t keep up. Let’s try this again! :""> If this doesn’t work out, I’m ready to be the cool uncle who lets my friends’ kids do awesome stuff with me. So, please, save me from that fate! HAHAHA!

👋 I'm a 30-year-old working professional in a management role, standing at 5'10"" and weighing around 80kg (normal BMI). 😊 I'm looking to find someone who shares my values and is also searching for something meaningful and potentially long-term.

A little about me:

* Love spending my free time at cozy coffee shops ☕, indulging in some PC gaming 🎮, and taking road trips 🚗 when I get the chance.
* Night Shifter. So I'm more active at night time
* I also enjoy those spontaneous outdoor coffee dates (parking lot vibes are underrated, right? ☀️) and am passionate about camping, though I don’t get to do it often enough.
* One of my favorite things to do is witness the beauty of city lights at night while sipping on a hot cup of coffee – it’s a simple pleasure I truly cherish. 🌃✨
* I’m a big fan of simple yet meaningful experiences – just taking time to enjoy life, even the small moments.
* I'm from the **South Side (from Alabang)**, so I'd prefer to meet someone who's near or within the area. 😊 (1-2hrs drive from my place)
* When it comes to faith, I’m open-minded but I’d prefer not to be involved with any cultish or overly restrictive religious practices. (*alam nyo na ibig kong sabihin*)
* Just to be clear, I don’t work out regularly – I’m more into enjoying life’s simple pleasures than hitting the gym.

What I’m looking for:

* You’re **single** (this is a non-negotiable for me) and ideally financially independent or working.
* I don’t have strict preferences when it comes to looks, as long as you're confident and comfortable with yourself. I truly believe confidence is key.
* On a personal note, I’m more inclined toward someone who isn’t into the chubby side (*I hope that doesn’t sound harsh, just my preference*).

I’m all about building something real, meaningful, and lasting. If you enjoy simple pleasures like a peaceful road trip, coffee dates, or just having good conversations under the stars, we might just vibe well together. 🌟

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, feel free to message me. Let’s see where this journey could take us! 😊

**-= CHANGE LOGS =-**

ABOUT ME:

* I used to sm0ke from 2014-2020 when I was in a band, but I quit because my current job requires client interactions, and I didn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable with the smell. I vape now, but it's a light, subtle kind, not the heavy, smoky kind. I can go days or even weeks without vaping, so I can stop when we're together. While I don’t see myself quitting vaping right now since it helps me manage stress, I'm open to stopping it eventually.
* I don't travel. I don't even have a Passport :/ I can't afford to be out of office for a week. But I'm open to it if we plan it accordingly.

ABOUT YOU:

* I respect career-oriented women, but I'm looking for someone who can make time to spend with me. I’m not just seeking an online friend, casual talking-stage thingy, but someone tangible.
* I’d love to hear from you, but please skip the simple 'hi'—put some thought into your message and let’s make this interesting!",4,1741918643.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False
1jatdng,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1jatdng/fully_automatic_coffee_machine_for_office/,Fully automatic coffee machine for office,"Hello everyone,

I am assisting the office in finding a fully automatic coffee machine.

I suggested a few options and decided on BoXcafe. However, the company has suddenly changed their mind and mentioned that 18k is a bit pricey.

We typically consume around 20-30 coffees every day.

In my previous company, we had two coffee machines: BosXh, which was used for regular beans, but it broke down several times due to overuse. The De'LongXi machine was for decaf (less consumption) and worked much better.

Do you have any suggestions? What coffee machine do you use in your office?


Thank you
