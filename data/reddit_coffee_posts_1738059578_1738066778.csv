1ic005s,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ic005s/i_m34_asked_my_friend_f30_out_and_her_response/,I (M34) asked my friend (F30) out and her response left me wondering who she even was. Did I misunderstand everything?,"TLDR: Developed feelings for a friend and before I got to talk to her, she iced me out. Still went ahead with it to put it to rest but her response has me wondering if I ever even knew her.

I should warn that this is a long story and there are no juicy tidbits — no forbidden romance, cheating or other drama. Just someone trying to piece together what went wrong.

I work as a journalist. I love my work but I often feel my introverted nature holds me back. That being said, the more I’ve opened up over the past two years, I’ve come to realize that a lot of my colleagues are socially awkward too. They’re also almost uniformly friendly and kind people. I’m very grateful.

I met Allysha (not her real name) through work, kind of. We actually had matched on Bumble months before when I was outside my city. She asked me what sort of journalism I did and I told her it was political. She asked me where I was based and when I told her where, she responded that she couldn’t talk to me because we’d be working in close contact with each other.

I kind of smirked when this happened. I had never met this woman before and thought it was presumptuous on her part to assume we’d ever ‘work together.’ But she had posted on her profile that she worked in politics, specifically dealing with the media.

I mostly forgot about this exchange until our paths crossed while I was working on a story. We’ve never talked about our first ‘exchange,’ and she was very helpful and cordial. Then one morning I woke up to a Twitter message from her that said ‘hey.’ It was delivered late on a Saturday night and I was suspicious. I responded to her and a day or so later she got back to me asking me for coffee.

It was strange. But she brushed it off. She said she just wanted to connect with a reporter working on a file her minister covered. Okay. I never brought up how weird it was to do this late on a Saturday.

But then a funny thing happened, we got along really easily. I’m introverted but always friendly, and can really turn up the charm. It wasn’t needed, though. She was snarky, a bit cynical, funny and smart. We started hanging out at least once a week.

The first two meetings (maybe) had the veneer of a being related to work but we soon dropped the act. She was eventually discussing her relationships with me and I told her a lot of personal information that I had never told my colleagues, let alone a stranger who worked for the ‘other team.’ But truth be told I wasn’t into her in that way. She was cute, sure, but there are a lot of young, attractive women in politics. She was my friend and that was it.

She also seemed to have done her homework on me. I’m very private. I don’t have any non-work related social media. Yet she had done some digging. She knew about my (failed) marriage and I confided to her about the divorce. I assume she got that information from people who I used to work with.

We slowed the pace of our meetings as summer approached. Then a few weeks later, after some sporadic contact, she roars back into my life. She was dating someone and the relationship blew up. She needed support, and I was there for her.

I encouraged her to date around. I told her to keep trying but also to have fun. You can have some hook-ups. It doesn’t always need to be serious. I really didn’t see her as a romantic option. She was my friend.

She called me a lot. We had weekly coffee meetings about her personal life in addition to hours-long phone calls. She also wanted to get to know me, often asking about my life, where I lived and my relationship with my family.

She was also becoming jaded with political life. She wanted to move home and start a new career. She hated her new role and her staff. She missed her former role and talked about going to law school. She was jaded with this place and it made me empathize with her.

I hate this small-town high school vibe this place can give off. Everyone knows your business and everyone thinks their lives are so interesting. People also collect names and seem only interested in chatting with others working in high-profile positions (though to be fair, I've never really had a problem with anyone and people are mostly very friendly with me). It's very much an environment conducive to social climbers obsessed with being seen. But as a journalist, I only have to write about them. Must be worse to actually be in the mire.

My job has been really busy as of late. In the lead up to the Christmas break, I kind of became a bit much, to be honest. I bugged her (and everyone in our mutual orbit) a lot for information, hoping to score a possible scoop.

My work is a priority and she seemed annoyed how fixated I was with it. She clearly was disinterested at best and angry at worst that she couldn’t control the inevitable changes happening. As political staff, she’ll be out of a job when the government is defeated, which is looking more and more likely.

I apologized after the dust settled and she seemed to accept it. I wished her happy holidays and left my office in mid-December feeling relieved. I couldn’t wait to have a break.

Then I woke up on my first day off and started thinking about her. I realized quickly that I liked her in a way that I hadn’t before. I don’t know why but it seemed obvious. She was so different from anyone I met through this job. I thought we were a lot alike.

But I was obviously worried. I don’t think she was keen to date me; she still worked for this government and I was still a journalist. I thought about what I would do and ultimately decided to see if I could gauge how she felt about me.

I messaged her during the break and we slid right back into things. She proposed we hang out when she got back. I suggested a movie and started eagerly anticipating her return.

The movie hangout went great. We talked a lot, got lunch and even hot chocolate. She mentioned that she was texting a guy but seemed annoyed about the predicament and made it clear she was very much single.

She messaged me afterwards, proposing to do something active next time. We agreed to go bowling the following Friday. The next day, it seemed like it was back to work chaos.

But I couldn’t get her out of my head. I was worried about coming on too strong so as a rule I never texted her first and never doubled-texted. She called me a day or two before we went bowling asking me to teach her how to skate. We were supposed to do so on Sunday.

Our bowling hangout also went great. We had fun and the conversation flowed really well. I was so excited to see her again. But I decided I needed to ask her out soon. I didn’t want to get jealous and weird.

The next day she abruptly cancelled our skating hang. I was crushed but asked if I did anything wrong. She said no, and that she just needed to catch up on a few things. I was hurt but didn’t let on.

The next day we started chatting as normal and I proposed hanging out the following day, and she agreed. She still wanted to skate so we did that. I was hopeful again.

We rented skates and she held my hand to make sure she wouldn’t fall. The snow was falling. It was very sweet but I didn't read anything into it.

We got a treat and she stopped me to take a photo for Instagram. She told me that a photo she posted of our bowling game had prompted a question from a mutual friend about who she was dating. I didn’t pry or respond much to that.

We got a drink after that and called it early. I was tired and admittedly cold. But I was thrilled.

I told myself I would ask her out next time. But I never really got my chance. After that, she became distant. She was slow to respond to me, and seemed upset with how work was going.

She even implied that the media was to blame for the government’s struggles, suggesting my colleagues and I weren't doing enough to criticize their opponents and would be happy when they lost. I politely but firmly rejected that suggestion. I can’t lie, I lost some respect for her for saying that. I had never criticized her personally for her work and feel like I only moved on from it because I had feelings for her.

The next day we started getting in a good rhythm again but when I asked her for coffee, she never responded. I called later that night and she was with a friend (heard the voice, it was a woman) and said nothing was wrong. I expressed some frustration and she said she would call me the next day.

She did that and when we spoke I told her I didn’t want to be one of those annoying guys on her phone, and apologized for calling. She heard me and then tersely told me she had other calls. I knew what was happening.

I was upset and vowed never to reach out to her. If this was it, so be it. It sucked but I’m not an idiot. I saw the writing on the wall.

Two days later, she texted me out of the blue. It was something about what was happening in politics but not at all her job. We went back to texting. I asked her to hang out. She first said Tuesday but pushed it to Wednesday because of work.

I knew I would be told ‘no’ but just wanted to be put out of my misery and ask her out. But on Wednesday, she barely looked up from her phone, seemed incredibly bored with me and left me feeling so confused.

I thought ‘enough is enough,’ and called her the following day. I told her I wanted to take her on a date and although I suspected the answer would be no, I hoped she would take some time to reflect on it. She was polite and said she would, but also said it was brave of me to ask (whatever that means).

Two days later, she texted me saying she had my answer. We spoke on the phone. It wasn’t a long conversation but to summarize, the answer was no. She said work was an issue, her uncertain future was an issue and she felt like our personalities weren’t good fits. It was hard to hear but it was appreciated because it firmly closed the door. We weren’t going to date if she was out of a job and moved cities. It was done.

I was admittedly hurt but I couldn’t get over the tone of our conversation. She spoke so formally in a manner comparable to HR laying you off. I was stunned. I’m your friend. You can talk to me like a person. But that wasn’t really the big thing. It was what she said about our personalities.

I only asked her out because I thought we connected. I don’t care about looks that much. That being said, she wouldn’t have matched with me if she didn’t think I was attractive and vice versa.

The weirdest thing is that she’s totally right. We don’t get along, at least not anymore. In a few weeks, she’s become so cold and disinterested with me, and has become a bit hostile defending this government. She’s also just so focused on her little political world. She’s even starting to name drop these random people that used to work for important people (so-so said this, they used to work for this person, etc…). It was annoying and off-putting.

Where did my friend go? Why did she want to hang out with me in the first place if she didn’t like me? Why did she seem so comfortable holding my hand for an hour but then turn cold to me days later? Did she just realize she actually didn’t like me? And if so, it took her a year to come to this conclusion?

Or is this all my own doing? Did I over-analyze everything she did because of how I felt? Did I linger on a stare or give on how I was feeling in some subtle way? Or maybe she was auditioning me and I failed?

I’m just so confused. But I’m also not heartbroken. I’m kind of relieved. She’s not the woman I wanted to date, at least not anymore. I don’t know if this is the real her but I feel immensely better knowing that. You can’t lose something that doesn’t exist.

I wrote her a long message that night telling her some iteration of this. I essentially said I no longer recognized her and wished her the best. I told her I cared for her but we would likely never be friends again. I went to bed feeling the happiest I had since after we skated together.

But then I woke up the next day and felt awful for the message. I felt like I overreacted and sounded like a spoiled brat because I didn’t get my way. I really don’t know what to think anymore.

We’re both in our early thirties but we’re not necessarily young. I guess she realized who she really was and now my friend is gone. I don’t know if it’s true or I’m just trying to make myself feel better but it does really seem like she’s just a climber focused on making 'ins' with a crowd of political lifers. Is she really just like the rest of them?

Or am I the problem?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/2VXfQIrNZy)  **Jan 12, 2025**

Hey everyone,

I (21f) cut contact with one of my closest childhood friends, Mary (21f), a few weeks ago. While I feel relieved she's out of my life, most of my family and mutual friends think I overreacted, and now I’m starting to second-guess my decision.

I’m going to put some rather irrelevant background information here…

Mary and I practically grew up as sisters. We were neighbors, and our parents started arranging playdates for us before we could even walk. From kindergarten to secondary school, we did everything together. If I wasn’t at her house, she was at mine. I trusted her completely and never thought of her as anything other than my best friend.

Things changed when Mary moved away for university. At first, I missed her, but over time, I noticed how much easier my life felt without her constant presence. I wasn’t being criticized, guilt-tripped, or forced to justify my choices anymore. It became clear how much control she’d had over me. Mary had a way of dominating every aspect of my life—she’d dismiss my hobbies and pressure me to quit them, and if she didn’t like one of my friends, I’d have to cut ties. You could call me a pushover, but when you grow up with someone like that, it’s hard to see the manipulation for what it is.

Things really came to a head when I met my now-fiancé, Dave (27m). He’s amazing—kind, supportive, and everything I’ve ever wanted in a partner. We clicked instantly, and he’s honestly the best thing that’s ever happened to me. But, of course, Mary didn’t approve. She immediately tried to plant seeds of doubt, saying he was too old, he’d cheat, or he was only using me. Thankfully, for once, I didn’t listen to her, and I’m so glad I didn’t.

In December, Dave surprised me with a dream vacation, and during the trip, he proposed! Everything about it was perfect—he planned every little detail, and it was more magical than I could’ve ever imagined. I was over the moon and couldn’t wait to share the news with everyone. Naturally, I told Mary, expecting at least some excitement, but instead, she downplayed the entire thing. She nitpicked the proposal, saying how she would’ve done it differently and what could’ve been better. It stung, but I brushed it off and reminded her that it was my proposal, not hers.

A few weeks later, we met in person for the first time in months. That’s when things completely fell apart. Out of nowhere, Mary told me I should break up with Dave. When I asked why, her reasoning had nothing to do with me. Instead, she compared him to her boyfriend, Julian (22m), saying things like, “Dave makes more money than Julian” and “Dave can give you everything, while I have to work for what I want.” It was clear she wasn’t concerned about me—she was just jealous. She couldn’t handle the fact that, for once, my life seemed better than hers.

That was the breaking point for me. I told her to leave my house, and afterward, I sent her a long message explaining how hurt and disappointed I was. I told her that her behavior was unacceptable and that I didn’t want her to contact me again.

Since then, it feels like she’s told everyone in our social circle. Mutual friends and even some family members have reached out, saying I was too harsh and should’ve handled things differently. They said, “That’s just how Mary is—you’ve known her your whole life. She’s always been in the spotlight and gotten what she wanted.” Some even accused me of breaking her heart and told me it was wrong to choose my fiancé over a lifelong friend.

Even my mom said she expected better of me, and that’s what’s making me question my decision. Did I overreact? Mary has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. Sure, she has her flaws, but we’ve also shared countless good times and memories. Am I throwing away years of friendship over this? Should I try to fix things, or was cutting her off the right choice?

since some people in the comments are claiming this story is fake:

Unfortunately, it’s not. I obviously can’t prove it to you, but honestly, what would be the point of making up a story and posting it on Reddit?

I’ve never used Reddit before and have no idea what karma is or why anyone would want it (???).

Also, yes, I let AI correct my text—mainly because I was incredibly angry when I wrote it and just kept rambling. English isn’t my first language, either. Combine these two things, and you can probably imagine that my original text was all over the place.

For clarification:

I don’t know exactly what Mary told my friends and family since most of the messages I received were pretty vague. I also didn’t ask my mom what Mary said had happened. I was too angry to have a calm conversation after my mom told me I was “being dramatic,” which led to me yelling at her. All I know is that Mary admitted to asking me to break up with my fiancé, but I don’t know if she explained why she wanted me to.

Lastly, my parents raised Mary like a second daughter, and she’s always incredibly kind in front of them. I guess that’s why they didn’t “believe” me. Maybe they’re just in denial because it’s easier for them to handle. I don’t know. But I get it—hearing something bad about someone you like for the first time can make you want to deny it.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/Ay8k01dKLD)  **Jan 13, 2025**

Quick sum up because the update is quite long:

I visited my parents today and found out that Mary told them that Dave was cheating on me. My dad ended up believing me, but my mom is still on the fence and unsure of who to believe.

Also, everything that’s irrelevant to the update is put in *italics* \- so if you’re only interested in the update you can skip the *italics* part.

*I honestly didn’t expect for so many people to read my post and to respond in such a positive way. Since some people asked for an update (which I also didn’t expect) I’m going to explain what happened today. Also, just a quick heads up - this is probably going to be all over the place since a whole lot went down and I’m mainly writing this down to understand what exactly happened myself.*

*But first of all, I want to thank everyone who was so kind to share their own stories. It was honestly incredibly mind-blowing to see how many people went through the same thing that I did (and still do), and hearing that cutting contact with their toxic friends was the right thing to do, made me even more sure about my own decision.*

*To all those of you who were calling my post fake, AI, or “karma-farming” (whatever that even means), I’m sorry to disappoint - but it’s sadly not any of those things. This is something that’s currently happening and I needed to get off my chest. I’m glad that you’ve never had to go through something like that, but judging by the comments, my story isn’t as unusual/unique as I thought and as far fetched as some of you might think. People often have toxic and narcissistic friends in their lives - especially when people around them have enabled their behavior from a young age (as in Mary’s case).*

*I’m also not going to have AI correct my grammar/spelling mistakes this time, so buckle up for some fun sentences. (Also, if someone knows any good websites that can correct whole sentences (not just autocorrect, but also grammar and stuff) please tell me which ones there are - me dealing with technology I’ve never used before is an absolute shit-show - there’s a reason why I’m studying law and not something IT related, lol)*

*I originally didn’t want to talk about/justify my relationship - it’s simply not what my post is about directly or an issue that I’m currently facing, but I’ve decided to address it anyway, why? I don’t know, but there were a handful of people in the comments calling my fiancé a pedophile/rapist, or saying that he groomed me, and so on. Most of these comments seemed to be coming from a place of concern (which I’m thankful for), but some didn’t. So yeah, that’s probably why I’ve decided to explain some things.* 

*I wasn’t groomed, love bombed or anything like that. My fiancé is an amazing guy who never forced me to anything or rushed me into marriage - like some comments suggested. I’m marrying him because he’s the one I want to spend my future with. Of course, we could have waited a few more years with getting engaged/married (eventually), but what’s the point in waiting when I’m (and he too, obviously) sure that he’s the right person for me.*

*Marrying at a young age (I’m going to be 23 when we’re officially getting married btw) isn’t for everyone, but it’s also not uncommon. With some people you simply have a feeling that it’s going to work out great - and when it comes to him, I have that.* 

*Some other people also suggested that my parents took Mary’s side because they don’t like Dave which couldn’t be further from the truth - they love him dearly and have considered him part of the family after a few months of us dating.* 

*I’d really appreciate if people who are considering commenting solely on my relationship would refrain from it - it’s not what this post is about, it’s not the main focus, and I’m set on my decision to be with him. You can think whatever you want about my relationship, but at the end of the day, you don’t know either of us or what our relationship is like.*



But now onto the actual update.

We visited my parents around noon today, talked about everything, and tried to understand what had happened exactly. Turns out, Mary really was telling a made up story while sprinkling in some truth here and there. Apparently she told people (or at least my parents) that Dave was cheating on me with a coworker of his, which is why she told me to break up with him. She said that this affair had been going on for at least 4 months and that she knows about it because she’d seen them together at a cafe in a different city a few months ago (let’s assume this would be true, why didn’t she inform me or my parents sooner? Like, imagine your “best friend’s” (back then) boyfriend is cheating on her and you know about it - wouldn’t you tell her right away??? This is also why I can’t understand why my parents (especially my mom) would believe her in the first place). According to her story, I got incredibly mad, kicked her out, and haven’t spoken to her since.

Now, some of it is true as you should know from my original post -

For one, her telling me to break up with my fiancé, as well as, me kicking her out and cutting contact. However, the whole story about Dave cheating on me is something I’ve heard about for the first time today + it’s completely made up. Just to remind you, she told me to break up with him because “Dave’s a better boyfriend than Julian (her boyfriend)” (btw, I also feel so sorry for him… I can’t imagine how much she must push him around).

My mom said that she didn’t believe Dave was cheating on me, but was disappointed in me for how I handled the situation, especially since “I couldn’t have known if Mary wasn’t telling the truth”. She thought that cutting off my “best friend” for being “concerned” about me was too harsh and that we should have talked it out. 

I’ve also assumed that she’s scared to lose longtime friends when I cut contact with Mary - which also turned out to be true. Mary told her mother what happened (who just so happened to be best friends with my mom) and according to my dad, Mary’s mother is mad at me for “treating her daughter badly” and accused my mom of “not raising me right”. So there’s that as well.

  
After my mom explained what Mary had told her I went on to tell her what really went down. The jealousy, the manipulation, the lies, all of it (basically the things I’ve said in my original post + much more). She didn’t believe me at first and said that I was blowing things out of proportion, that Mary had good intentions but simply didn’t know how to communicate them well. I showed her some text messages between Mary and me, told her about past incidents, and my fiancé tried to back me up as best as he could since my mom wasn’t listening at all and kept defending Mary. To say that I dug deep and told my parents about all sorts of things is an understatement - I even went as far as telling them about a “sex incident”, so yeah, I didn’t leave out any details. 

My dad believed me from the get go, but my mom kept going back to “how great of a person Mary is” and “how she just wants the best for me”. She also kept saying how I’ve never had an issue with Mary in the past (not true!!) and that I’m now creating unnecessary drama because of a misunderstanding (- maybe I’m creating unnecessary drama, maybe not. In my opinion it’s necessary, though. I’ve let her do whatever she wanted for far too long).

At some point my dad simply told her to shut up and to stop making excuses for Mary - so at least I have one parent on my side. 

My dad’s always been a very non-confrontational person and never really stood his ground (especially when it came to my mom), but I found out that he thought that Mary didn’t have a good influence on me growing up. He apparently also told my mom that he wanted to limit the contact between Mary and me when we were younger, but my mom didn’t see his point and let our friendship continue. 

So basically, this whole issue could have been avoided if my mom would have put her friendship with Mary’s mother aside for her own family. Great.

In the end, my mom said that she’d speak to Mary and ask her if what I’ve said is true, which honestly pissed me off. After everything I’ve told her she still wants to crawl to Mary because apparently “what her actual daughter says isn’t good enough”. She tried to justify it since “Mary is her daughter too” and “it’s unfair to just hear out my side of the story” - alright?? But you already had a heartfelt conversation with Mary in which she was lying to you completely??? After she said all of that we started a screaming match - I know, not healthy, but it honestly felt so damn good to just let it all out.

To say that I cried heavily out of frustration after talking to my mom is an understatement and I’m so glad that my fiancé was with me because I sure as hell wouldn’t have been able to drive home safely. But, on a good note, I got ice cream and we watched my favorite show when we arrived back home which made things better, lol. 

I’ve not told my mom that I’m considering not inviting her to my wedding. We’re not planning to get married until next year anyway, so there’s still enough time for her to make up her mind about who she’d rather believe + I don’t want to create too big of a rift between me and her. 

As for mutual friends who took Mary’s side, I’ve decided not to respond to them. I’m not sure if Mary told them the same story that she told my parents, but I honestly don’t care. I don’t want to see Mary ever again (or at least not in the foreseeable future) and mutual friends would make that a whole lot harder than it needs to be - besides, they’re not my only friends or close friends of mine. Dave’s also okay with me not running after them to clear his name - if this whole situation should leave this friend group and turn public, I’m going to contact them, but right now, we don’t see a point in dealing with Mary’s minions (that’s something someone called these friends in the comments below my original post. Loved it!)

Right now I’m just hoping that Mary messes up her story somehow and that my mom is going to see her for who she really is. While she’s been acting absolutely disgusting towards me and basically chooses Mary over me in this situation, I think that I can look past this. It’s my mom after all… Cutting off friends is one thing, but cutting off close family? That’s a whole different story and I’ll try to mend things the best I can. If she’s going to stay loyal to Mary… I don’t know what I’m going to do, but that’s not something I have to think about right now.

*Once again, thank you for your positive and helpful comments. I’ve read all of them, but they kept coming in at a rapid speed and I didn’t really know how to respond to most. Also, for those who went through something similar, I’m so sorry that this happened to you and I’m incredibly glad that (as far as the comments go) all of you could find peace in your decision to cut toxic friends out of your lives.* 

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/llRYybPR3c)  **Jan 15, 2025**

I just want to say this in advance: I don’t know if my dad was telling the full truth! I do believe him, but he might have exaggerated or left things out. It’s entirely possible that he lied to a certain extent - I personally don’t think that, but then again, most of the things he told me yesterday, I’ve heard about for the first time and they make him seem incredibly innocent. Maybe he was lying? I don’t know. This whole situation just makes me question who I can trust in general. 

So, we had dinner with my dad last night and it went pretty well overall. We mainly talked about my mom and Mary.

Apparently my mom had always been concerned about what others thought about her, but when she met Mary’s mother, it reached a whole new level. Mary’s mother often criticized my mom for all sorts of things - her parenting style, her clothes, her house, you name it. Whenever it was something that my mom could change, she changed it immediately to appease Mary’s mother. That’s also why I was put into dance classes when I was younger - because Mary’s mother signed Mary up for dance classes (one of many examples). So yeah, as most comments suggested, she’s being pushed around by Mary’s mom. Is she a narcissist? I don’t know, I’m not a psychologist.

One thing to know about Mary’s family is that they do a damn good job at appearing “perfect”. Happy family, nice jobs, nice house, etc., I guess my mom bought their persona and tried to copy it. (I’m not going to trash talk the whole family here, but let’s just say that they have just as many flaws as any other family)

Also, my mom was apparently talking shit about me to my dad. Comparing me to Mary in basically every way and she even said multiple times that “she wished Mary was her real daughter”. She also believes that I took away her chance to live her dream life. Fun fact, but according to my dad, my mom’s apparently HUGE on family. She always wanted to have at least 4 children,  ironic, I know. She had a pretty traumatic birth experience with me and doctors told her that she shouldn’t try for children again - yeah, apparently she’s blaming me for that. She then hoped that she’d get to live her dream through me - basically that I have a lot of children. Bit of tmi right here, but I’ve mentioned it in the comments a few times already, so whatever; I can’t get pregnant, like at all, which means she (luckily) won’t get any grandchildren from me. 

I guess she sticks so close to Mary and Mary’s mother because she hopes to be “a grandma” to Mary’s potential children (that’s honestly so creepy and messed up in my opinion, but well, we’re talking about my mom here)

I also feel the need to clarify that I didn’t know ANY of that. My mom never said anything negative about me to my face - sure, there were some comparisons here and there, but nothing major or something that had an impact on me. It’s always been just general stuff that parents tend to do - comparing grades, behavior, skills, etc. She’s also never directly blamed me for her inability to have any more children and never said anything bad about me not being able to conceive - this is all just stuff she apparently said behind my back. She’s always been pretty alright to me. She most definitely wasn’t the best mom ever, but she wasn’t horrible either - just a person who (in my opinion) shouldn’t have had a child in the first place. 

My dad also admitted that he’d considered divorcing her a few times, but never went through with it because he was scared that my mom would get primary custody. He’s currently considering it again, so let’s see how that goes.

As for why he never stood up to my mom? He genuinely didn’t have a reason for it. He knew that my mom’s never said anything like the things above to my face, so he didn’t think that he should tell me (at least not until I moved out). He didn’t engage in these type of conversations with my mom and kept telling her to stop every time - which caused a lot of fighting between them. I knew that their marriage was messed up, but I always thought this had different reasons. 

Also, my mom reached out to my mother in law and complained about Dave - how he changed me and stuff (referring to me cutting off Mary and choosing my fiancé over my “best friend”). My MIL (who’s an absolute angel btw) simply asked her why she’s discussing this with her since Dave and I are adults - there’s no need to contact her for it. My mom also told her that Mary said that Dave is cheating on me. She then simply told my mom “sounds like Mary’s projecting” and hung up.  I’m honestly so pissed that my mom tried to involve her in this situation and I can’t help but wonder if she tried to create conflict between my MIL and my fiancé. Maybe she genuinely believes Mary and wanted to warn my MIL, but I guess that would be wishful thinking. For some background: my MIL was a single mom because her ex boyfriend (Dave’s father) cheated on her shortly after giving birth - as you might be able to imagine, she hates cheaters with a burning passion and my mom obviously knew that.

So yeah, I guess my mom talked to Mary who doubled down and my mom decided to believe her. I was expecting that this would happen, but honestly, I’m really disappointed. I’m not even sad, angry, or anything - just absolutely disappointed (and confused). I’m currently considering sending her one last text before cutting her out for now, but I don’t know if I should give her the pleasure of receiving an explanation. I’m still on the fence about cutting ties with her in general, mainly for my dad’s sake. Their marriage is rocky already and although he’s considering divorcing her I’m not sure if he’ll actually go through with it. Keeping in contact with one parents while not talking to the other one must put a whole lot of stress on the parent you’re still in touch with, and I quite honestly don’t want to worsen my dad’s home life any further. 

It’s so crazy how I’ve lost so many people, who I considered important to me, in such a short amount of time. This whole situation also made me question other people - like my dad - a whole lot. There were so many people in my life throughout all those years and nobody said anything?? Why didn’t my grandparents step in? Or my aunt? Or family friends?? I can’t imagine that they didn’t know about any of it, but then again, I didn’t either.

I also have no idea why I never noticed that my mom held some sort of resentment towards me, shouldn’t I was noticed? I mean, I’ve been living with her under one roof for 18 years, yet I never noticed/imagined that she actually doesn’t like me.

Also yes, Reddit became my new diary, lol.


[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/isxdmQadBZ)  **Jan 17, 2025**

[UPDATE 3] AITA for cutting contact with my childhood best friend because she demanded that I break up with my fiancé?

This is just going to be a small update since not much happened, but I still want to share this because I think it’s quite ironic.

It’s also pretty late at night and I’m staying at a hotel right now, so sorry if some stuff doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.



I had a gig tonight and Mary’s ex boyfriend, Julian, showed up after the show. Yes, ex boyfriend. He came up to me and told me that he broke up with her this morning - he then got free drinks for the rest of the night and we had an amazing time at the after party, lol.

I’ve already mentioned this in the comments, but I told mutual friends (who ASKED, not those who attacked me) what really went down between Mary and me. I guess they’ve told other mutual friends and it got around to Julian. He asked her if my story is true and Mary apparently got really defensive; after some back and forth, she called him “an option that she’s keeping around until Dave’s single or she finds someone better” - he dumped her right there and then. Mary must have spiraled after that because she texted me over a new Instagram account and said that I’ve “ruined her life”. 

I don’t believe in karma, but this honestly made my day. 

Also, I’ve called my grandparents and they didn’t know how my mom really felt about me which honestly puts my mind at ease a bit. At least I wasn’t the only one being oblivious, I guess she did a really good job at hiding her true sentiments. 

For my parents - I’ve decided to go LC with my mom and keep in touch with my dad. He’s not going to divorce her any time soon for several reasons. I’m also still on the fence on whether to cut ties with my mom completely or not. While many people in the comments mentioned that they’re not in contact with their families anymore, I don’t feel “ready” for that yet. I want to have a conversation with my mom first, just so that I can hear (what I’ve been told by my dad) straight from her - but right now, I don’t want to have that conversation. So yeah, I’m basically keeping her around for now.

[Update 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/4VObnT2l10)  **Jan 21, 2025**


I don’t really know how to start this, so yeah. 

Mary hasn’t tried to contact me again, but she started sending videos of her “having fun with herself” to Dave. It’s been 3 so far and they’ve all been sent through different burner accounts. He didn’t respond to any of them and we don’t really know what we should do about it - he gets send videos like that quite often, but it’s usually just “one video per person”, not 3 in a row sent by the same one which makes them easier to ignore/block. So far he’s obviously deleted all videos she’s sent him and blocked her on every account through which she tried to contact him. He hopes that if he’s not going to respond that she’ll stop soon and well, I hope so too. It’s honestly getting annoying hearing my ex - best friend moan my fiancé’s name. 

I also met up with my mom today. She texted me yesterday and asked me to meet up. She knows that Julian and Mary broke up and also knows the reason for it. I don’t know how she’s gotten the story - it apparently was a weird mismatch of Julian, Mary, and Mary’s mom. My mom was pretty distraught when she told me this and all of it didn’t make a whole lot of sense - Mary told her this, Julian told her that, and so on… she ended up believing Julian over Mary for whatever reason. Maybe it was because last time I met up with my mom I told her that Mary’s interested in Dave and that obviously matches Julian’s story? I have no idea. I also don’t know why Julian told her - I’ve asked him to talk to my mom after some people suggested it in the comments, but he seemed pretty apprehensive.. I guess he ended up telling her anyway. 

Overall, she was very apologetic for not believing me and siding with Mary. She also asked me if Mary tried anything with Dave so far and I told her about the videos. She’s really mad at Mary and has blocked her number for now and also wants to limit contact with Mary’s mother (as far as I know), but doesn’t really know how to go about it yet. They share a lot of hobbies and are basically in all the same “clubs” - book, sports, and so on. Typical late-50s mom stuff basically.

So yeah, I guess everything’s fine. I’m still going to keep my distance from her, but she seemed very genuine about wanting to make things right. We’re on a better path now, still not great, but we’re getting there. 

This might also be the last update - unless something big should happen, but if everything’s going to stay the way it’s right now, there’s not much to update on.

\- getting started (and the beauty of enjoying the process)

\- how to pitch (and not apologise)

\- what to do to stand out as a young copywriter

**HELLO LOVELIES!**  
  
It is I - [AMY WORGAN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyworgan/). your resident newsletter writer/annoying Mancunian/blue hedgehog enthusiast (I’m finally seeing Sonic 3 TODAY and I think I might cry hearing THEE Keanu Reeves as Shadow).  
  
But I guess ‘newsletter writer’ is the thing you’re really here for.  
  
This is my first newsletter of 2025 (hold for applause…) so I’m going to be giving you ALL the hot tips to keep yourselves FRESH for the year ahead.

I’ll be sure to keep you updated on if I make or break my own targets. I’m only human, which means, yes, I did work all through Christmas and burn myself out like an idiot.  
  
…anyway!  
  
You ready?  
  
*Then let’s freaking goooooooo!*

  
**TAKE TIME TO LEARN COPYWRITING (AND ENJOY IT!)**

https://preview.redd.it/8fm676g33qfe1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4072ddb8a1332e9b1838dc7012bb10370d376ec

  
The BIGGEST mistake I see newbie copywriters making is doing too much, too fast.  
  
They’re running before they can walk. Throwing themselves in the copywriting deep end before they even know what this career IS. Because that’s what copywriting is, right? A career! Sure, it can be a side hustle or a passion, but it’s also what entire companies are built on.  
  
Knowing and respecting just how influential words can be is the pillar that everything you do should be built on.  
  
And I’m not saying you need to buy and read every single book on copywriting there is out there. I’m not saying you need to take a million expensive courses. If I was saying that, I’d be a massive hypocrite, because I’ve done neither.  
  
But what I am saying is that a lot of people I see get excited about rushing into this industry that they know nothing about, a lot of the time with a metric shit-ton of confidence (which I can only admire, considering I have always been my biggest critic and always will be).  
  
Having confidence is great, don’t get me wrong, but it’s backing it up that counts.  
  
Proving to the world that you know your shit.  
  
When I started copywriting (blindly, stumbling) in April 2023, I thought of myself as a dumb little sponge. I bowed to the gods of copywriting and thought I needed to learn all I could before I was worthy of clients or payment. Soak aaaaaall that good knowledge up.  
  
So on my lunch breaks at my minimum-wage retail job, I watched the Word Tonic masterclasses.  
  
I learned from Eddie Schleyner (all-around legend and lovely guy) and Schlomo Genchin (who taught me so much about AI when I was still fucking terrified of it).  
  
I created spec work (aka brand fanfic) and learnt the basics of how copywriting differs from form to form.  
  
My confidence grew with each class, with each question I asked, with each headline or blog post or description I wrote.  
  
TL;DR?  
  
Have the faith that I didn’t, but also be humble and know there’s so, so much to learn, every day, every sentence you write. Be open to trying new things and getting it wrong, to being told that you’re wrong, and most importantly, LEARNING FROM IT.  
  
*I’ve fucked up more times than I can imagine, and I still manage to write for* [*Semrush Academy*](https://www.semrush.com/academy/)*. So that’s something!*



**PITCH BITCH**

https://preview.redd.it/p6j3ebe73qfe1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80b690af07ec6c416906b399bb9fd386433b9d00

**One of the questions I get asked the most, without fail, will always be:**  
  
‘How did you get your first client?’  
  
How do you get that foot in the door? How do you sell yourself (oi, get your mind out of the gutter) to the people who need words and have the money to back it up?  
  
Truthfully? I took a risk.  
  
My first client was a café in my work’s building. The owners were a lovely couple and had recently moved into the space. They had decent foot traffic from the building, but their social media was lacking a bit.  
  
I decided I wanted to help them. But I was fucking terrified to get rejected. To fall flat before I’d even taken a step.  
  
So I asked Carolyn (aka Word Tonic’s supreme daddy) for advice.  
  
She said what she did when she was getting started was to present someone with a win-win offer. You write some stuff for free. You get experience, they get free shit. If they don’t like it, they don’t have to use it. It’s an offer they can’t refuse!  
  
Plus, I had nothing to lose, so I thought, ‘fuck it, why not?’ One day on my break I asked the owner if I could help run their socials. I probably stammered through an explanation and apologised a few times for interrupting her busy lunch shift. Her face was neutral and gave nothing away. I was shitting it, I won’t lie. And then she said…  
  
‘Get the fuck out of my face, you ridiculous little WORM.”  
  
Just kidding. Could you imagine? She actually said...  
  
‘Yeah, that sounds amazing! We can’t afford to pay you at the moment, but we’re happy to offer coffee and cake in return!’  
  
Ah… Music to my ears.  
  
So for the next three months, until I handed in my notice and quit my job in the building, I posted on their Instagram and Facebook. Made silly posts about smoothies and cakes. I loved it (and the free treats were a huge bonus).  
  
I put it on my portfolio with a bunch of spec work. It wasn’t much, but it was there. Carolyn saw what I was doing and offered me a place on this newsletter, after a trial go, of course.  
  
And now I do this for a living and get paid for it.  
  
What’s changed between then and now?  
  
I’ve stopped apologising when I pitch myself (which, luckily, isn’t very often any more… subtle flex). I let my writing speak for me. I don’t take it to heart when I get aired on LinkedIn or email, which can be… a lot. I know that we’re all just busy people and if people have an issue, it’s their issue, not mine. I’ve been doing this long enough to know what the fuck I’m doing… most of the time.  
  
I’ll go into more specific tips on pitching yourself in my next newsletter, most likely, but for now, just know:  
  
This career can be scary, and can feel like so much more than just writing at times, but being open to trying new things and taking risks will always pay off. If not now, then down the line. I promise.  
  
You’ve got this, bestie!

But what does the term actually mean, and what years does it cover? Let’s break it down and explore why this style is still so popular today.

# When Was Mid-Century Modern Furniture Made?

Mid-century modern furniture usually refers to pieces made from the mid-1940s to the late 1960s. This was right after World War II, when people wanted their homes to feel fresh and modern. Designers started creating furniture that was simple, functional, and stylish, using new materials like plastic and plywood.

# What Makes It Special?

Mid-century modern furniture has a few key features that make it stand out:

* **Clean Lines:** The designs are simple, with straight lines and soft curves.
* **Organic Shapes:** Many pieces have gentle, natural curves that make them look inviting.
* **Mixed Materials:** Designers used wood, metal, plastic, and glass together to create unique looks.
* **Functional Design:** Every piece was made to be useful, not just pretty.
* **Bold Colors and Patterns:** While natural wood tones are common, you’ll also see bright colors and fun patterns.

# Why Do People Still Love It?

There are a few reasons why mid-century modern furniture is still so popular:

* **It Fits Any Style:** Whether your home is modern, cozy, or a mix of styles, these pieces can work well.
* **It’s Simple:** The clean designs make your space feel calm and uncluttered.
* **It’s Well-Made:** Many pieces were built to last, so they’re a great investment.
* **It Feels Nostalgic:** For some, it brings back memories of family gatherings and simpler times.

# How Can You Add It to Your Home?

If you want to bring mid-century modern style into your space, here are some easy tips:

1. **Start with One Piece:** A cool chair or a sleek table can be a great focal point.
2. **Mix It Up:** You don’t need to go all-in. Pair mid-century pieces with modern or vintage items for a unique look.
3. **Add Color:** Use cushions, throws, or artwork to bring in bold colors and patterns.
4. **Choose Functional Pieces:** Look for furniture that’s both stylish and practical, like a coffee table with storage.
5. **Keep It Simple:** Don’t overdo it. A few well-chosen pieces can make a big impact.

Mid-century modern furniture is more than just a trend—it’s a timeless style that can make your home feel warm, stylish, and functional.

TL;DR:
I (21M) thought my topper friend (21F) was into me after spending years together — talking late nights, sharing secrets, going on outings (95% funded by me), and giving subtle romantic signals. When I confessed, she said it was always platonic and ghosted me. Months later, she apologized but claimed she liked someone else all along. I feel used and confused about her intentions. Did I misread the situation, or was she playing me? Are topper this means and selfish?

(Full post has all the details for better context.)


Hi everyone,

I’m (21M) in my final year of college and working alongside my studies. I wanted to share this story to get an outside perspective on something that's been bothering me for months. Did I misjudge her (21F), or is she exactly what I think she is?


---

When I started college, I made some friends, but things went downhill quickly. Among my acquaintances was a topper in our class. In the first year, our relationship was basic — more like an acquaintance. But in the second year, she helped me during exams, and we occasionally talked about notes and studies.

One day, out of the blue, she asked me to go for a movie with her. It was just the two of us, and we watched Avatar 2. Afterward, we had dinner, I dropped her off at her hostel, and I went home. It seemed pretty friendly.

But slowly, things took a turn. We started talking on calls/text — late-night conversations for hours — and we started hanging out more. We went to movies and places together, always just the two of us. It was wholesome. She confided in me, telling me secrets she wouldn't share with anyone else. She said she was shy and that toppers can be lonely. She shared her sadness, her feelings of loneliness, and things no one else knew about her.

Most people in college found her mean and cold, but she was actually quite sweet and warm when it was just the two of us. We would laugh a lot when were together.

It felt special. I started thinking maybe there was something more between us, but I didn’t want to ruin our bond by misinterpreting anything. So, I let it continue.

By the third year, things became more intense. We went out frequently, but I noticed I was paying for almost everything. I spent close to ₹15,000 on our outings — movies, lunches, coffees, small gifts, and playzones. She, on the other hand, may have spent around ₹500-₹1000 or less. I was also always the one picking her up and dropping her off.

What confused me was how she behaved differently with me compared to others. Among people, she was reserved and cold, but with me, she was sweet and caring. It felt like she had two versions of herself, and I believed the version I saw when we were alone was real.

Over time, she gave me what I thought were clear hints. She would send me songs with romantic lyrics, send reels that seemed suggestive, and give me a level of attention that felt more than platonic. After months of feeling this way, I finally mustered the courage to tell her how I felt.

In April 2024, I wrote her a heartfelt letter explaining my feelings and what she meant to me. I took her on what I thought was a perfect date — movies, a great lunch, playzone games, coffee, and a thoughtful gift. At the end of the day, I handed her the letter and asked her to read it later.

But instead of the response I expected, she ghosted me. No reply for three days. On the third day, she finally responded with, “Aisa kaise ho sakta hai?” (How is this possible?)

Like I was sure we had something and she acted so weirdly.

I was devastated. She later replied with a letter saying she never thought of us romantically, that it was always platonic for her.

I stopped talking to her after that (feeling used and betrayed), I would have never felt something like that for a topper if she didn't lead me on like that. Months went by without contact until one day she texted me that she doesn't know what she did and she didn't attend that moment what she should have done..I snapped and texted her in anger, calling her out for leading me on. She started calling me repeatedly — 20-30 calls that day — begging me to talk to her. When I finally agreed to meet, she apologized. She said she didn’t want to lose me and admitted that she called me a friend but ghosted me when things got complicated.

I tried to move on, but I couldn’t shake the confusion. She claimed she liked someone else all along, which made me question everything. If she liked someone else, why was she spending so much time with me? Why did she act so differently when we were alone? Was she enjoying the money I was spending on her? I agreed to talk but realised soon later that I can't just be a friend to her now. 

In December 2024, we went out again for a movie and dinner, but I decided to observe her more closely this time. I realized she never says no to anything and always plays the innocent card. It dawned on me that she might be a gold digger who enjoyed the attention and money I spent on her.

Kya mera kaata Gaya h?


On 31st December, I blocked her to close that chapter and start fresh in 2025. But even now, I’m left wondering:

Did she ever like me, even a little?

Was she just using me for free outings and attention?

Was she genuinely innocent and saw me as just a friend?

Were all those hints and signals just in my head, or was she deliberately giving them to keep me around?
I feel used and confused. Any insights or advice would mean a lot. If you have more questions please do. Girls and guys all are welcome to comment.

**The details:**

* The new Janus-Pro model family generates high-quality images from text descriptions, with 1B and 7B parameter models available.
* Janus-Pro outperformed DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion in key industry benchmarks for image quality and accuracy, such as GenEval and DPG-Bench.

* The launch follows [DeepSeek's R1 release](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIAssisted/comments/1ibv6g8/how_to_run_deepseek_r1_offline_on_your_computer/), which achieved o1-level reasoning capabilities at far lower costs — shaking U.S. markets and the industry.

**Why it matters:** DeepSeek is the talk of the town, and the effects of R1 are being felt throughout markets as the world digests the reshaping of assumptions around development costs and capabilities.

The first year we were together, he bought me a small thoughtful gift. That felt like enough for me and I was happy because I still lived with my friends who decorated the house and my parents got me a cake. 

The second year, we planned a weekend away together (which we split 50:50). On my birthday he didn't get me a card or a birthday cake (we were in Dublin and it really would've been easy to do). His gift to me was to go to an escape room. This really upset me because I had never shown any interest in this and it was something he had been talking about doing for a long time and it made me feel like he was just doing it for himself. It ended in a massive argument with him getting defensive about how was he meant to know it would be important for me to have a card and a cake on my birthday. 

  
The third year, he did get me a card, a cake and a present. But again the cake was from the place that HE likes and was off the shelf, which made it feel very impersonal towards me. He also only got me one gift. It's not really about the gift but that same year after I had bought him a number of gifts, we went to visit his parents who live abroad on his actual birthday. For his birthday he received a large sum of money from them but was upset that he didn't have any small gifts to open. So, I threw him a surprise ""do-over"" birthday with lots of small gifts to open, balloons and decorations. I just wanted the effort to be reciprocated and it felt like it wasn't. He told me he would throw me a re-do birthday too but he never did. 

This year, one of my gifts came early and the box said what it was. I said I didn't want it early because it was important to me to have things to open on my birthday but he insisted I would still have gifts to open. When I woke up on my birthday I did have a cake, a card and presents, but the cake was from the same place as before (which I don't like) and was in a flavour I don't even like. I did only have one gift and he had just wrapped it in lots of layers. When I unwrapped it was a gift card to a health food store. While I do like the store, the gift card just felt so impersonal. For comparison, I (a full time student) bought him (a doctor earning 6 figures) 8 small gifts and a weekend trip for both of us for his birthday. It's not really about the money but it just feels like the effort isn't being reciprocated and that things I'm saying are important to me aren't being listened to.

I (21M) thought my topper friend (21F) was into me after spending years together — talking late nights, sharing secrets, going on outings (95% funded by me), and giving subtle romantic signals. When I confessed, she said it was always platonic and ghosted me. Months later, she apologized but claimed she liked someone else all along. I feel used and confused about her intentions. Did I misread the situation, or was she playing me? Are topper this means and selfish?

(Full post has all the details for better context.)


Hi everyone,

I’m (21M) in my final year of college and working alongside my studies. I wanted to share this story to get an outside perspective on something that's been bothering me for months. Did I misjudge her (21F), or is she exactly what I think she is?


---

When I started college, I made some friends, but things went downhill quickly. Among my acquaintances was a topper in our class. In the first year, our relationship was basic — more like an acquaintance. But in the second year, she helped me during exams, and we occasionally talked about notes and studies.

One day, out of the blue, she asked me to go for a movie with her. It was just the two of us, and we watched Avatar 2. Afterward, we had dinner, I dropped her off at her hostel, and I went home. It seemed pretty friendly.

But slowly, things took a turn. We started talking on calls/text — late-night conversations for hours — and we started hanging out more. We went to movies and places together, always just the two of us. It was wholesome. She confided in me, telling me secrets she wouldn't share with anyone else. She said she was shy and that toppers can be lonely. She shared her sadness, her feelings of loneliness, and things no one else knew about her.

Most people in college found her mean and cold, but she was actually quite sweet and warm when it was just the two of us. We would laugh a lot when were together.

It felt special. I started thinking maybe there was something more between us, but I didn’t want to ruin our bond by misinterpreting anything. So, I let it continue.

By the third year, things became more intense. We went out frequently, but I noticed I was paying for almost everything. I spent close to ₹15,000 on our outings — movies, lunches, coffees, small gifts, and playzones. She, on the other hand, may have spent around ₹500-₹1000 or less. I was also always the one picking her up and dropping her off.

What confused me was how she behaved differently with me compared to others. Among people, she was reserved and cold, but with me, she was sweet and caring. It felt like she had two versions of herself, and I believed the version I saw when we were alone was real.

Over time, she gave me what I thought were clear hints. She would send me songs with romantic lyrics, send reels that seemed suggestive, and give me a level of attention that felt more than platonic. After months of feeling this way, I finally mustered the courage to tell her how I felt.

In April 2024, I wrote her a heartfelt letter explaining my feelings and what she meant to me. I took her on what I thought was a perfect date — movies, a great lunch, playzone games, coffee, and a thoughtful gift. At the end of the day, I handed her the letter and asked her to read it later.

But instead of the response I expected, she ghosted me. No reply for three days. On the third day, she finally responded with, “Aisa kaise ho sakta hai?” (How is this possible?)

Like I was sure we had something and she acted so weirdly.

I was devastated. She later replied with a letter saying she never thought of us romantically, that it was always platonic for her.

I stopped talking to her after that (feeling used and betrayed), I would have never felt something like that for a topper if she didn't lead me on like that. Months went by without contact until one day she texted me that she doesn't know what she did and she didn't attend that moment what she should have done..I snapped and texted her in anger, calling her out for leading me on. She started calling me repeatedly — 20-30 calls that day — begging me to talk to her. When I finally agreed to meet, she apologized. She said she didn’t want to lose me and admitted that she called me a friend but ghosted me when things got complicated.

I tried to move on, but I couldn’t shake the confusion. She claimed she liked someone else all along, which made me question everything. If she liked someone else, why was she spending so much time with me? Why did she act so differently when we were alone? Was she enjoying the money I was spending on her? I agreed to talk but realised soon later that I can't just be a friend to her now. 

In December 2024, we went out again for a movie and dinner, but I decided to observe her more closely this time. I realized she never says no to anything and always plays the innocent card. It dawned on me that she might be a gold digger who enjoyed the attention and money I spent on her.

Kya mera kaata Gaya h?


On 31st December, I blocked her to close that chapter and start fresh in 2025. But even now, I’m left wondering:

Did she ever like me, even a little?

Was she just using me for free outings and attention?

Was she genuinely innocent and saw me as just a friend?

Were all those hints and signals just in my head, or was she deliberately giving them to keep me around?
I feel used and confused. Any insights or advice would mean a lot. If you have more questions please do. Girls and guys all are welcome to comment.

Chapter 1: First meeting



""W-What the-?! How did you end up in my apartment?! What do you want from me?"" Trace said, slowly backing away from the tiger keidran.



""Calm down! It's not what you think! My apologies if I scare you, Trace."" The tiger keidran got out of bed and did a little morning stretch. ""Last night when you saved from that lunatic, I knew there's a good feeling about you and you're the only person I could trust."" 



""Just what are you doing here and how get in here, Flora?"" Trace said.



""Huh? Wait, how did you get to know my name?"" Flora asked, confused.



""Well, I.. Uh.. Nevermind but seriously, where did you come from?"" 



""As soon you walked into your apartment, I climbed through the balcony and realized that one of the sliding doors aren't locked, so I went in and now we meet again!"" Flora said. 



""Oh right... Normally, I always leave the balcony door unlocked so I could go out for some fresh air."" Trace said, he looked at the clock on the wall and realizes that he's about to be late. ""Crap! I better get going! I'm gonna be late for work!"" Trace rushes to his wardrobe to prepare some clothes, he grabs a towel and runs towards the bathroom to take a quick bath. 



Flora on the other hand explores his apartment for a bit. She looks at some the pictures over the wall, one of it that caught her attention is a wedding picture of Trace and his late wife Saria. 



""Hmm.. If Trace is married to this woman, I wonder where is she now..?"" Flora thought to herself. While she waits for Trace to come out of the bathroom, she had the urge to prepare him breakfast so she could save him some time. She grabbed a couple of bacon and eggs, turn on the stove and began cooking until they're ready for serving. She then also makes him a sandwich for lunch. Meanwhile, Trace just finished taking a bath. He ran towards his room to get dressed and later rushes to the kitchen only to discover that Flora had prepare him breakfast. 



""Woah.. You made me breakfast? Thanks a bunch, Flora. Just what I need."" Trace said, he sat down at the table and began taking a bite. 



""Anything for you, Trace! I also made you lunch for work."" Flora sits next to him and watches him eat. ""Erm.. so who's that girl next to you in the picture?"" She asked. 



""Her? I... I'd tell you more about her but I have to get to work right now."" Trace said. He soon finishes his meal and went to brush his teeth. 



Flora stood up and went over to him. ""Oh.. Okay.. I'm sorry I had crash into your place without asking for your permission."" She holds his arm as she feels a bit guilty about it. 



""It's fine, Flora. Feel free to drop by if you'd like. I got to head off for work now."" Trace said, after brushing his teeth, he grabbed his briefcase and walked out of the front door then heads down to his car. 



Flora followed him from behind, she taps on his shoulder to get his attention for a moment. 



""Flora? Look, is there something you need? I'm gonna be late for work so you better make it quick."" Trace said. 



""Trace, can I come with you?"" Flora asked.



""I.. I'm sorry.. you can't visit me when I'm at work."" Trace said, he opens the door and puts his briefcase inside.



""Why not..?"" 



""My supervisor ordered everyone not to invite non-employees in the workplace. I'm sorry, Flora. Those are the company rules."" He gets into his car, puts the key into the ignition and starts it up. 



""Oh.. Okay... I understand.."" Upset that she can't visit Trace, Flora decides to walk back to her car. 



As Trace backs out of the driveway, he sees Flora returning to her car. Before leaving, he stopped next to her and lowers his window. 



""I'll see you later, Flora! I promise!"" Trace waved his hand to her before driving away. 



He soon arrives at the office that he works at. He parked his car and heads towards the lobby.



""Mr. Legacy, looks like you're running a bit late."" The receptionist said, looking at the computers screen with a blank expression. 



""I know. I must've overslept, Ma'am. Last night's shift was tough."" Trace said. 



""Everyone is expecting you to arrive. You know the routine. By the way, your tie isn't properly done there, Mr. Legacy.""



""Oh! Right.. sorry.. I'm going to my cubicle now. Have a good day, Ma'am!"" Trace said. He stopped for a bit to arrange his tie then rushes into the elevator and pushes the button.



""That tiger keidran.. There is something special about her. But how did I get know her name in the first place..? Who knows, I'll have to see her again after this."" Trace said in his thoughts. Eventually, the elevator finally arrives to the floor he works at. He walked past through his colleagues and reaches his cubicle to continue his day of work.



Meanwhile, Flora stopped by at a cafe to catch her morning coffee. Before entering the shop, the door opened up and she was then greeted by Sythe, who came walking out of the cafe. 



""Flora? Hey, it's been a while."" Sythe speaks to her while holding a paper bag. 



""Sythe?! What are you doing here??"" Flora said, she is surprised to meet her Ex. 



""I was just about to return to my car after ordering a few cups of coffee for my colleagues. Wasn't expecting I'd run into you again."" Sythe responded. 



""I never knew you're a policeman now, Sythe.."" Flora said. ""Look, I'm just passing by, trying to get my morning coffee, okay?"" 



""B-but we're still friends? Right, Flora?"" Sythe asked, nervously scratching the back of his head. 



""Just leave me alone for a while, and no we're not dating each other again, got that?"" Flora says to him in a serious tone. 



""Okay, fine.."" He sighed. ""Anyways, it's good to meet up with you again. Maybe we should talk some other time, see ya soon, Flora."" Sythe goes back to his patrol car and drives off.



Flora enters the shop and walks to the counter. The barista notices her and began asking for her order. 



""Welcome to Sunrise Cafe, can I take your order please?""



""I'd like to order a cup of Cappuccino please."" Flora says to the cashier. 



""That'll be $0.74, miss."" The cashier responded to her.



Flora reaches for her purse and pulls out the exact amount of money for her drink. ""Here ya go, sir!""



""Thank you, miss. Here's your order!""



Flora goes to sit down by the table, she grabs a brochure to read. Not along after she started reading, a young handsome man with long blonde hair approaches her. He gives her a friendly gesture and sat down next to her. 



""Hello, miss. You wouldn't mind If I sit next to you?"" He says to Flora with a friendly manner and gesture.



""Uhh.. Sure, if you'd like."" Flora says to him while she reads the brochure. 



He hands out his business card, placing it on the table next to her hand. ""The name's Eric Vaughan by the way.."" Eric says to her and gives Flora a wink. 



Flora looked at the card and asked. ""What's this? Are you looking for somebody like me?"" 



""Well, my family runs a high-end clothing stores from NYC and here in LA. I was hoping if I could hire a model like you, it seems to me that you're the perfect one for the job."" Eric said, he pulled a comb out from his coat and combs his long blonde hair. 



""Well.. I'm sorry, but not interested."" Flora said, shaking her head as she refused his offer. 



""But, but I'll pay you more! I promise, I won't waste your time! Give me a call if you're having second thoughts."" Eric says to Flora before he stands up and walks out of the Cafe. 



""I wonder what is up with that guy?"" Flora said in her thoughts. She proceeded drinking the coffee that she had ordered earlier. She picked up the business card that  Eric had left, putting it in her purse.



""Coming to think of it, I should've accepted his offer earlier. I'm just nervous what would Trace think of this since I don't have a job.."" She becomes anxious about it, but decided to keep the modeling job in mind in case if she needed extra cash.



Later around 4pm in the afternoon, Trace had just finished work and is on his way down to the parking lot. He got into his car, put the ignition on, and drove off. He then started having thoughts about Flora, thinking that she had arrived back to his apartment before him.



""Great.. just great.."" Trace said, now stuck in traffic, he looked over the radio and turns it on to listen to some tunes.



""I suppose Flora is already at my place right now, all alone by herself. I sure hope this traffic would die down at any moment now.""



After about 10 minutes, the traffic starts to become less congested. Trace eventually got back to his apartment safely. He notices that Flora's car is parked in the garage, indicating that she's already there. He parked his car on the driveway, grabbed his briefcase, and walked inside.



""Flora? I'm home!"" Trace said, but no answer. ""Flora? It's me, Trace! I'm back!"" He shouted, nothing but dead silence surround him.



""That's odd, but I'm sure she's around here somewhere.."" As Trace went to his room to get himself changed, Flora sneaks up on him from behind. 



""TRACE!! It's great that you came back!"" Flora lounges at him, pinning him to the floor.



""ACK-!"" He looked at Flora, who is happy to see him coming back from work. ""Hey, I was looking all over for you, Flora. I was starting to worry on how you'd handle yourself alone.""



Flora leaned in and kissed him on the cheek. ""I'm just glad that you returned. I know how to look after myself, Trace. It has been such a long day, and I couldn't wait much further!""



""That's great and all, but would you mind getting off on top of me? I'm trying to change back to my home clothes."" Trace said. 



""Right.. sorry, Trace! How silly of me."" Flora chuckled, she nodded and followed his words, she backed up and went to the living room to wait for him.



After Trace got himself changed, he then joins her as he sat down on the couch next to her.



""So, Flora? How was your day and where have you been?"" 



""Well.. just like any ordinary day, except that I had an encounter with my Ex earlier at a cafe."" Flora said.



Trace tensed up and asked, ""Wait.. you previously had relationships with him? I never knew about that.."" Trace said. ""So what's he like? Do you wanna talk about it?""



""His name is Sythe, Trace.."" Flora responded, ""About 4 years ago, Sythe and I had a stable and healthy relationship until he started rushing the marriage plans which made me uncomfortable and had to break-up with him.."" She starts feeling upset, wiping off the tears on her eyes.



""Are you alright, Flora? Do you need a glass of water?"" Trace asked. 



""Sure.. I need to drink up for a bit."" She responded. 



Trace goes to the kitchen to grab a glass of water for Flora. He walked back to the living room and hands it over to her.



""Here you go, I hope this makes you feel better.."" 



Flora began drinking the whole glass of water until the last drop. ""Oh thank you, Trace.."" She looked at him and gave him a smile. 



Trace also smiled at her as well. ""Oh, no worries! Anything for you, Flora.""



""Oh, by the way. Can I talk you for a bit?""



Trace nodded and asked. ""Sure thing, Flora. What's on your mind?"" 



Flora went to grab her purse on the table, she opens it and takes out the business card that Eric had provided to her. 



""While I was at the cafe.. this guy by the name Eric, asked me if I wanted to work as a model in his fancy clothing brand.."" 



Trace asked her, concerned. ""O-Okay.. is there something wrong about it?"" 



""I don't know, Trace. He seemed like a nice guy, but I've never done modeling in my life."" Flora answered. ""Before I met you, I lost my previous job on the other day and got evicted from my apartment for refusing to pay rent. I don't know what to do here, Trace!"" She cried worryingly. 



Trace understood how Flora felt, he touches her hand, gently holding it as he looked into her eyes. 



""Whatever you're going through, I'm here to help you out, Flora. I promise.."" Trace comforted her by gently stroking her hair.

Bailey is not a typical size Husky and is smaller than Coffee, a Kelpie in size. The hike went well where both dogs behaved normally and showed no signs of aggression towards each other at any point.

After the hike we decided to go chill at a park. This particular park had signs that said dogs need to be leashed. Not far away from us were two guys playing catch with a tennis ball. Coffee has always had a crazy obsession with balls. She’d always chase after any ball she sees relentlessly no matter the time and place. She saw the tennis ball and wanted to run after it and to my surprise Amanda did not stop her and instead dropped her leash and said “go Coffee!”. Needless to say Coffee ran after the ball immediately and I could see the confusion on the two guys’ face as she stole their ball. The guys tried to get their ball back and this made Coffee charge back at us at full speed. Bailey is very defensive of me so when she saw this she got into a defensive stance and the next thing we know they got in a fight. It all happened very quickly. Bailey ended up getting clawed in the face and eyes and there were blood everywhere. 

We drove to the nearest emergency vet straight away where Bailey was given stitches and the vet also checked on Coffee which was uninjured thankfully. The vet bill ended up costing $650 which I was not in a position to afford at that point in time. I had to call my mum in the hospital to borrow some money so I could settle the bill on the spot. On the way back Amanda offered to pay for half the bill which I accepted. This is where I think I might be the asshole.

And what does it tell the pods when it comes to the creamers? Is it the same process as the coffee: squeeze x amount of water through, or is there more going on? It's interesting as some pods say put the creamer in first, while others say second. Some creamers give more foam (the latte especially) while others less (the ordinary creamer).

Hey everyone! 🌟 

Let’s dive into a topic that makes our hearts race, our minds wander, and sometimes leaves us scratching our heads—relationships! Whether romantic, platonic, or familial, the dynamics of connection can be as thrilling as they are complex.

- **Connection Over Perfection**  
Society often paints the ultimate relationship as one that sparkles with perfection. But let’s get real!  
Every relationship is uniquely imperfect, and that’s what makes them beautiful. It’s the shared laughter during silly moments, the comfort of silence, and yes, even the disagreements that mold us. 

- **Growth Through Challenges**  
Ever noticed how some of our strongest relationships have gone through trials?  
These challenges force us to confront our own flaws and vulnerabilities. It’s uncomfortable, but guess what? It leads to growth!  
Facing difficulties together can solidify a bond in ways that smooth sailing never could.

- **Communication: The Secret Sauce**  
Here’s a hot tip—open communication is absolutely essential.  
It’s easy to assume our partners know what we need or how we feel, but clarity begets understanding. Regular check-ins, sharing feelings, and yes, sometimes having tough conversations can nurture trust.

- **The Dance of Independence**  
While relationships thrive on togetherness, we can’t dismiss the importance of individuality.  
Maintaining our own interests, friendships, and pursuits fuels the relationship with fresh energy. Imagine a vibrant tapestry woven with two unique threads; that’s what independence brings to the mix!

- **The Role of Gratitude**  
A little gratitude goes a long way!  
Regularly acknowledging the little things your partner does helps foster warmth and appreciation. Say thank you for making coffee, for listening, or just for being themselves. These small gestures can create a positive feedback loop that fuels lasting love.

- **Navigating the Growth Together**  
As we grow, so do our needs and desires.  
It’s essential to check in with each other regularly. Change is inevitable, so tune in to each other’s evolving dreams and aspirations. You might discover new things to inspire and challenge each other along the way!

In essence, relationships are like a satisfying albeit unpredictable roller coaster. They are exhilarating, filled with highs, lows, loops, and moments of pure joy. Each twist and turn adds depth to your connection and enriches your individual lives.

This will be a slightly different revenge story, more along the lines of “the best revenge is to live your best/most authentic life!” Honestly, I always rolled my eyes at that because it seemed ridiculous - how is that “revenge”, right? But then it happend to me and gosh, it feels SO good!

Back in 2020 I got a job at what I thought was my dream company. I was a narrative designer, and I’d never done that kind of job before in my life but I had been writing some kind of stories since I was a pre-teen so I was super pumped to learn how to do narrative design and brought that energy into the office! 

For some reason, my unofficial boss and official mentor seemed to dislike me from the get-go. That’s completely fine, I’m not everyone’s type of “bubbly” and I have ADHD so I know how that can come across as too high-energy… Actually, it WOULD have been fine… had she not let her personal feelings impact the work environment. 

To not make this post into another novel, I’ll list some things she did:

- I would ask her for feedback on my work, she would say everything looked good, then on the HR meeting she would say everything sucked and my stories didn’t perform well. When I asked why she didn’t suggest improvements, she made excuses like “well everyone has a different style”. When I said the other girl that joined the team a few months before me was getting suggestions from her mentor, she said that girl was a junior… and I was apparently not? Don’t know how that made sense since I never did a job like that in my life. I was a copywriter before, very different skills.

- she told me I go to the bathroom too often and should count/time the minutes I spend in the bathroom and deduct them from my lunch break. I’m not even kidding. After that meeting (HR was there btw!) I shared with the HR that I likely have IBS or a health problem that caused me to use the toilet a few times more in the mornings. It absolutely never impacted my job as I’d stay longer to finish my tasks if needed. The HR said she understands… but said that smokers also deduct time from their lunch break so I should do the same. (None of the smokers I talked to after that actually do that, and even if they did, it’s really, really not the same)

- I found this out after leaving the company, but she asked my coworker to write down on a piece of paper every time I got up from my desk to do anything (toilet, get coffee or water etc) and report to her at the end of the week. This completely explained why my relationship with my other coworkers was strained and non-existent. 


There were more situations, but this post would be way too long if I got into everything… I cried at least once a week at that job. Every HR meeting I needed to prep myself cause I knew I would be put down and likely cry when I left the meeting. I knew I was gonna be fired… I mean it was obvious from all of the above. 

Last meeting we had, when I was let go, she told me “I just wasn’t good at this” insinuating I wasn’t that good at writing/conceptualizing stories. She definitely was happy when she said that. 

I had been writing all my life… so that’s when the Petty Queen inside me roared in protest! 

And so…. I wrote my first book on the writing platform I found out about because of work - Wattpad (we sometimes hired writers for the games from that site). My book did… surprisingly well. I started building a small readership base. 

Then I wrote my second book… I decided to apply to a contest they held, and managed to submit my book literally 3 minutes before the closing deadline. 

The results came out and… I was one of the winners! In fact, not just that - I won a prize!

A publishing book deal.

They wanted to PUBLISH my book in the USA! Mind you, I’m from a small European country and English is my second language. I don’t actually know of anyone who was traditionally published in the US from my country, other than having their books translated and sold there after having been published here.

So… all I can say now to that “mentor” is THANK YOU.

Thank you for being the worst boss/coworker/person I ever had the displeasure of meeting.

Thank you for mobbying me and making my days Hell.

Before you, I had given up on my “published author” dream and focused on “my real jobs”.

You, and only you, are the reason I wrote that first book. To prove how incredibly wrong you were, how much potential I had, and that I could write good, attention-grabbing stories… and perhaps had you been an actual mentor that guided me and helped me be a better narrative designer none of this would have happend!

I would have used all of my ideas for the company games, and I would have never sat down and wrote a whole book (two books so far!).

Now I have a book releasing in August of this year, and it will touch American soil before I ever could (kinda cool haha). 

So yeah… keep being PETTY because sometimes being petty is what makes your biggest, wildest, dreams come true. 

PS. If you see this, thank you Charlotte for being you! Every time I watch your videos, I feel such warmth and joy because you are such an incredibly bright light in this world. I hope you keep making content for years (decades?) to come! ",12,1738062655.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,1.0,False

I recently subscribed to The Economist print edition, which I absolutely love, but the $319 annual cost is a bit steep. I was thinking of sharing the issues with others in Charlotte to offset the cost.

Here’s my idea: I’d keep the magazine for a week to read, and then sell it for $2–$3 to someone locally who’s also interested in reading it (albeit a week later). I’d ask for at least a 6-month commitment from anyone interested to make it worthwhile for both of us.

I posted this on Facebook Marketplace, but I haven’t had much luck so far. Are there other places or creative ways in Charlotte where I could find people who might be interested in this kind of deal? Local groups, libraries, coffee shops, or maybe another platform I’m missing?

One fine day in 2021 my parents and to their place and I saw her after 10 years and I felt a renewed connection with her after having a small chut chat. I'm a bit shy, so I didn't reach out on social media after that.  We met twice in 2022 with our family but It wasn't until December 2023 that we really connected. We had a nice chat before grabbing coffee with her younger brother at a cafe. That day, we made plans to celebrate New Year's Eve 2024 together. From then on, we talked more and started hanging out about once a month, usually with her brother.

By julf aug 2024, we got closer. Conversations were easy, we both would flirt with each other over text. Her brother would no more come along with us and we would spend great time together, would be together hanging out till mid night for hours. We had a good thing going, but it wasn't romantic. But one day in aug she texted me that I could flirt but it's better if I don't like her the other way. I told her that feelings can be complicated and hard to control.

Despite that, we kept hanging out, even more often, like several times a week by December 2024. Then, in January 2025, I found out something about her past that bothered me, but I pretended I was fine and told her it was no big deal. She opened up about a bad relationship. Even after hearing this, my feelings for her didn't change, I felt bad about hearing that she was involved in sexual intercourse with the guy but I just accepted it, for I'm into her so much now.
She's about to shift to other state after 5 months.
I recently told her how I felt, but she seemed unsure. She said she wasn't ready for a relationship. I tried to change her mind, telling her I was serious about her and that we could have something special. She stood firm, saying she needed time alone and didn't want to be in a relationship, i begged her for a chance and assured her that everything would just keep getting better but she still told me that it can't happen, I asked her if it can ever happen to which she replied that she didn't know. She asked me to not stress upon feelings and let it flow and let things unfold and its own and if it has to happen it will happen. 

Her rejection hurts. It's hard to grasp that she gave a chance to someone who hurt her, was abusive and left her, but hesitates to do the same for me, someone who cares for her deeply. It's even tougher knowing her family is moving in four months. 
I've been living alone for a while now but being with her hanging out with her have made everything so much better, never felt like I was alone but now, almost had everything living alone but her. 
The woman I care about, the one who became such a big part of my life, is slipping away, leaving me feeling lost and uncertain.
Now I wish I had hung out with other friends that I once had when they asked me to. 

(We both are same rn and I act normally and will continue to be the way we were)

Hello everyone,  

I wanted to share something I experienced recently and ask you for some advice. Some time ago I had Covid and during that time I made the mistake of drinking coffee. This triggered one of the worst panic attacks of my life. I really felt like I was losing control of my mind, unable to manage my anxiety or even manage myself. It was absolutely terrifying.  

In the days following this episode, my anxiety remained extremely high, although it began to gradually decrease day by day. However, one thing still persists today: an intrusive obsession, an intense fear of losing your mind or, even worse, of developing an illness like schizophrenia. This fear is overwhelming at times, and although my overall anxiety is slowly improving, this obsessive OCD-like thought does not go away.  

I also have intrusive thoughts of harming myself, my family, or my animals. It’s really scary, I feel like I’m on the verge of losing control. A kind of impulse phobia but 10 times scarier.

I'm really afraid of doing something stupid one day.

I wonder if this type of obsessive fear is common after a Covid infection?

Has anyone else experienced something similar? 

If so, do you have any tips or strategies to reduce anxiety and better manage these intrusive thoughts? 

I would be extremely grateful for any help or testimony.  

Thank you very much for taking the time to read and share your advice.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

I unboxed it with the enthusiasm of someone who’s never assembled furniture without crying. The instructions were straightforward, but I still managed to panic when I couldn’t find the “on” button. (There's a child safety lock. I’m not proud.)

I stared at the three spouts, hot, cold, and room temperature, and I imagined all the ways this machine could revolutionize my life. Cold water for my iced coffee. Hot water for instant ramen (my gourmet specialty). Room temperature water for… well, I guess for people who aren’t as dramatic about their water as I am.

But then I started spiraling. What if it’s too loud? What if it leaks? What if it judges me for drinking straight from the spout? But so far, it's been pretty good.

# My Favorite Features

**Bottom loading design.** Just slide the bottle in, connect it, and let the machine do the heavy lifting. I love not having to awkwardly hoist a massive jug around. 

**Three temperature settings.** The cold water is so crisp it feels like it’s mocking my fridge. The hot water is perfect for tea, soup, or pretending I’m a barista. The room temperature option is… fine. It’s there if you’re into that sort of thing.

**Child safety lock.** The hot water spout has a child safety lock, which is great if you have kids or if you’re as clumsy as I am. 

**Empty bottle alert.** The LED display is handy, but the empty bottle alert is a bit dramatic. It flashes a bright red light like it’s auditioning for a horror movie. Don’t put this in your bedroom unless you enjoy sleeping in a rave.

**Stainless steel design.** The stainless steel finish makes it look like it belongs in a high-end kitchen. It’s also easy to clean, which is good because I’m 90% sure my kids use it as a canvas for their sticky fingerprints.

**Noise level.** The compressor is quiet most of the time, but it occasionally makes a sound like it’s trying to communicate with aliens.

# Pros

* **No lifting.** The bottom-loading design is just what I needed. No more throwing my back out trying to change a water bottle.

* **Instant hot water.** The hot water spout is great for tea, oatmeal, etc.

* **Cool design.** It looks so good in my kitchen that I’ve started referring to it as the appliance that ties the room together.

* **Easy to clean.** The stainless steel finish wipes clean in seconds, which is great because I hate cleaning.

* **Child safety features.** The safety lock on the hot water spout gives me peace of mind, even if my kids still try to break into it.

# Cons

* **Empty bottle alert light.** The flashing red light is so bright, so be careful where you keep it.

* **Noise level.** While it’s mostly quiet, the occasional alien communication sounds can be jarring.

# Final Thoughts

The Brio Bottom Loading Water Cooler is a great buy if you hate lifting heavy water bottles, want instant hot and cold water at your fingertips, and appreciates the modern design.

It’s not for you if you’re sensitive to noise or don’t have the space for it.

But overall, I’m obsessed with this thing. It’s functional, stylish, and makes me feel like I have my life together (even though I definitely don’t).

She stood firm, saying she needed time alone and didn't want to be in a relationship, i begged her for a chance and assured her that everything would just keep getting better but she still told me that it can't happen, I asked her if it can ever happen to which she replied that she didn't know. She asked me to not stress upon feelings and let it flow and let things unfold and its own and if it has to happen it will happen. 

Her rejection hurts. It's hard to grasp that she gave a chance to someone who hurt her, was abusive and left her, but hesitates to do the same for me, someone who cares for her deeply. It's even tougher knowing her family is moving in four months. 
I've been living alone for a while now but being with her hanging out with her have made everything so much better, never felt like I was alone but now, almost had everything living alone but her. 
The woman I care about, the one who became such a big part of my life, is slipping away, leaving me feeling lost and uncertain.
Now I wish I had hung out with other friends that I once had when they asked me to. 

(We both are same rn and I act normally and will continue to be the way we were)

my first ever high stim pres finally arrived. Until now my pre workout supplement was a coffee.

I've already tried Zeus which was meh, Crack OG was OK but it wasn't a good feeling, I was a little nauseous. Wildfire was good, I was training for 2 hours straight and burned 1000 calories.
Legit was amazing. My best workout in the last few years. 
I took a full scoop every time.

Any tips how should I store them? These should last like 2-3 years if I take them twice a week.
I put an extra silica bag in the tubs after shaking them.

How would Excelsior, Crack Barbarian, Maniaco and Defiant Unleashed Yayo compared to these?

Cheers

Toronto, January 2025. Snow fell gently, cloaking the city in a layer of pristine indifference. But Eugene didn’t have time to admire the winter wonderland—he was too busy gearing up for yet another round in his never-ending legal circus. Armed with a pen, a stack of documents, and enough caffeine to power a city block, Eugene was ready to take on the *esteemed* bureaucracy of legal chaos and its motley crew of robe-wearing dramatists.. ""I didn’t choose the legal life,"" Eugene muttered under their breath, ""the legal life chose me.""

Inside 130 Queen Street, the Divisional Court building hummed with the dull energy of people who’d long given up hope of finding justice, replaced by the thrill of completing forms in triplicate. “If Kafka and Orwell had a baby,” Eugene muttered, clutching a stack of documents that could double as body armor, “it’d grow up to design this system.”Eugene’s battle was no ordinary David-versus-Goliath story. His Goliath wasn’t a singular foe but a hydra with heads labeled College, Employers, Unions, Tribunals, and Courts. Every time he lopped off one head, two more sprouted, and each came with a filing fee.

“If irony were a sport,” Eugene quipped to the security guard who now greeted him by name, “I’d have a maple leaf tattooed on my podium. Gold medal, no question.” The guard gave a polite chuckle—the kind that said he’d heard the line one too many times.

The HRTO and WSIB had handed Eugene case number, but it might as well have been tattooed on his forehead. Between the rejected applications, delayed hearings, and dismissal letters, he had enough paper to start a bonfire—or at least keep warm through February. “At this point, I’m not even fighting for justice,” Eugene grumbled into his coffee. “I’m fighting just to see how ridiculous this can get. Spoiler alert: very.”He stepped outside for a breath of fresh air, where the snowflakes floated down like a gentle reminder that the world didn’t care. “I swear,” he muttered, watching his breath freeze midair, “if this were a movie, it’d be called *Fifty Shades of Litigation*. And I’m the unpaid extra who keeps getting dragged back into the plot.”But Eugene wasn’t about to give up. No, giving up was for people with lives, hobbies, or an actual shot at peace of mind. “Besides,” he thought to himself, “if I quit now, who’s going to keep these bureaucrats in shape? Lifting all this paperwork has to count as cardio.”

**The Background Circus**

Eugene’s workplace didn’t just disregard safety standards—they treated them like a mythical creature: nice to imagine but utterly nonexistent. Diagnosed with severe health conditions that left him in constant pain and teetering on the edge of collapse, Eugene’s requests for accommodations were met with the kind of enthusiasm reserved for tax audits.

The employer’s unofficial motto? “If it doesn’t kill you, it’s not our problem.”The Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) wasn’t much better. Designed to protect injured workers, it functioned more like a bureaucratic obstacle course. Endless forms, delayed responses, and denials disguised as ""assessments"" left Eugene wondering if the system’s real purpose was to wear people down until they gave up. “They call it WSIB,” Eugene quipped. “I call it *We’re Sorry It’s Bogus.*” Despite his Herculean efforts, it often felt like the system was designed to exhaust, not assist. WSIB sent him to a ""Hard Work Program"" that would make Navy SEALs cry, all while denying basic accommodations. “I signed up for compensation,” Eugene joked, “not boot camp.”

Then there was the union—a shining beacon of incompetence. Instead of fighting for him, they fought against him, mishandling his grievances and leaking his private medical information like gossip at a high school cafeteria. Promises of advocacy? Broken. Accurate information about benefits? Forget it. “The union said they were on my side,” Eugene later joked. “I just didn’t realize it was the side of my employer.”

When his workplace and union both failed him, Eugene turned to the HRTO. That’s where he learned that justice doesn’t just move slowly—it moves at a pace that makes glaciers look hyperactive. Case became his personal purgatory, drowning him in red tape, filing fees, and procedural delays.But Eugene’s troubles didn’t start with the Tribunal; they began with a job that treated workers like disposable parts in a machine. Chronic pain, debilitating injuries, and unsafe working conditions were ignored as if acknowledging them might disrupt the profit margins. Safety protocols? Optional. Accommodations? Only if you considered being overworked into a health crisis an ""accommodation.""“I wasn’t asking for the moon,” Eugene would later say. “Just to not be permanently broken by my job. Apparently, even that was too much for them.”The union’s so-called ""support"" only made things worse. Medical privacy was thrown out the window, grievances were dismissed faster than an unpaid parking ticket, and any promises they made dissolved like snowflakes on a Toronto sidewalk. “They said they’d represent me,” Eugene said bitterly. “Turns out they represented the concept of incompetence.” “They said they’d have my back,” Eugene laughed bitterly. “Turns out they meant with a knife.”By the time Eugene stood before the HRTO, he wasn’t just fighting for justice—he was fighting to survive a system designed to exhaust him. Case 403/24 became a never-ending battle against a machine that thrived on apathy and delay. But Eugene wasn’t about to quit. When the system turned its back on him, he decided to keep pushing forward—not for the win, but because he refused to let them bury him without a fight.

**One-Liners Galore to Keep You Sane (Think Prozac, Xanax, and Tequila—Spoiler: Stay Off the Floor)**· 

“I filed at HRTO. They responded with a delay so long, I forgot what I was filing for.”· 

“I asked for workplace safety, and they handed me a canary and said, ‘Good luck!’”· 

“If justice is blind, then bureaucracy must be deaf and has no GPS and they forgot to mention it’s also hard of hearing and has a terrible sense of direction.""· 

“Workplace safety? It’s like Russian roulette—except every chamber is loaded, and you’re the one holding the gun.”· 

“I asked for workplace safety, and they handed me a canary with a knowing smile. Spoiler: it didn’t make it.”· “Filing a motion with the Divisional Court is like ordering fast food—if your burger took five years, cost $200, and came without fries.”· 

“Filing a case with Courts feels like diving into quicksand, except the quicksand sends you invoices.”· “Divisional Court? More like the Bermuda Triangle of legal progress. Enter if you dare.”· 

“Between WSIB, HRTO and Courts, my new hobbies are crying into forms and drinking coffee strong enough to dissolve my filing fees.”· 

“The Attorney General must be ghosting me. Either that or their office is stuck in a bureaucratic black hole.”· “Every organization told me, ‘We can’t help.’ I didn’t know ‘passing the buck’ came with an Olympic training program.”

**The Paper Trail from Hell: A Dark Comedy of Canadian Injustice**

Eugene’s submissions to the courts and human rights bodies weren’t just legal documents—they were architectural wonders, sturdy enough to double as a coffee table or a booster seat for a short judge. His accusations spanned the entire spectrum of bureaucratic dysfunction: employer negligence, union betrayal, tribunal incompetence, and even judicial bias. 

""If paperwork were a weapon,"" Eugene mused, ""I’d be leading an army.""The process seemed less about justice and more about grinding him down. The Subjects responded to his claims with a deluge of documents so voluminous it made *War and Peace* look like light reading. As Eugene sifted through the mountain of exhibits, he couldn’t help but chuckle, ""Exhibit D has more plot twists than a Netflix thriller.""

Eugene had planned every detail of the case meticulously. ""If this were a heist movie,"" they thought, ""I’d be George Clooney... except with fewer Oscars and more Post-it notes.""Eugene’s new reality revolved around filing motions, rebutting objections, and injecting just enough sarcasm to keep his sanity. ""Humor is key,"" he said. ""Otherwise, this would just be an overpriced masterclass in existential despair.""Accommodations? Denied. Constitutional questions? Ignored. Deadlines? A joke. Correspondence either got lost en route or arrived fashionably late, like a bad date. ""At least they’re consistent,"" Eugene sighed, ""consistently dreadful.""The physical toll of his legal battles was almost as severe as the psychological one. ""Who needs a gym membership when lifting this case file gives you the same gains as CrossFit?"" he quipped, as he wrestled yet another binder into submission.

Eugene’s filings were encyclopedic—an anthology of failure across multiple institutions. They captured everything: fabricated claims by WSIB, HRTO’s disregard for evidence, and systemic barriers so robust they deserved an award. His work was a tragic symphony of bureaucratic incompetence played in a minor key.""If there’s one thing Canada does well,"" Eugene reflected, ""it’s turning injustice into performance art. And here I am, stuck in the middle of a Kafkaesque exhibit.""

**A Black Hole of Accountability**

The HRTO wasn’t the only institution turning a blind eye. Complaints to the Attorney General’s office went unanswered, like shouting into the void. Workplace safety boards, ombudsman offices, human rights commissions, and legal support centers all joined the chorus of “Not our problem.”Even WSIB (Workers’ Safety and Insurance Board) decided to pile on. They fabricated claims, misrepresented medical evidence, and shoved them into a “rehabilitation program” better suited for Navy SEAL training. “My doctor said rest,” they deadpanned, “but WSIB thought CrossFit was the cure. Spoiler: it wasn’t.”

**Battling the Courts and Tribunal Hydra**

Eugene’s odyssey through the labyrinth of tribunals and courts was a masterclass in frustration. Over the years, he endured more delays, dismissals, and baffling procedural hurdles than he could count. The Tribunals relentless denial of accommodations and its uncanny ability to ignore critical evidence might have been impressive—if it weren’t so maddening. “They should rename this place the *Tribulation Office*,” Eugene quipped. “At least then, it’d be truth in advertising.”

When the Courts entered the fray, things didn’t get better. Decisions arrived devoid of reasoning, constitutional questions were dismissed with a casual wave, and Eugene’s voice seemed lost in the judicial void. “They say the wheels of justice turn slowly,” Eugene sighed, “but these wheels aren’t just slow—they’re square.”Years ticked by. Complaints stacked higher than his patience, delays stretched endlessly, and decisions reeked of indifferent efficiency. 

The Tribunals and Courts knack for denying accommodations, ignoring evidence, and dismissing cases bordered on performance art. “I’ll give them credit for one thing,” Eugene remarked dryly. “They’re consistent—consistently useless.”Even when the Higher Courts stepped in, it felt more like stepping backward. Constitutional questions were brushed aside, rulings were vague at best, and every request seemed to meet a collective shrug. “At this point,” Eugene muttered, “the wheels of justice aren’t turning—they’re rusting.”

Desperate for a glimmer of fairness, Eugene turned to the Courts, only to find a bureaucratic machine grinding at its own glacial pace. Cases dragged on for years, evidence went unnoticed, and rulings felt more like cryptic riddles than resolutions. “The Tribunals and Courts operates on a timeline all its own,” Eugene said with a weary smile. “It’s like dog years—but slower. By the time they resolve one case, I’ll be eligible for a senior’s discount.”

**In Court: The Comedy of Errors**

Eugene entered the courtroom armed with determination and a well-honed sense of sarcasm. “Your Honor,” he began, “I’d like to address tribunal delays, systemic discrimination, and the fact that I’ve aged a decade waiting for this moment.”The court, however, was unshaken. Delayed decisions, denied accommodations, and a pervasive sense of indifference became the norm. The only thing moving faster than the proceedings was Eugene’s patience—right out the door.Judges swatted away constitutional questions like pesky flies, tribunals ignored established precedents, and requests for accommodations were treated as luxuries, not rights. 

When Eugene asked for an interpreter due to psychological distress, the response was a vague, “We’ll get back to you... eventually.”Inside the courtroom, the absurdities continued to pile up. Evidence was dismissed with a wave, rulings were cryptic at best, and the process felt like an elaborate game where the rules were rewritten daily. Eugene couldn’t resist quipping, “Your Honor, I’d love to present my case, but I think my rights got lost somewhere in the filing cabinet.”

Finally, the day of the hearing arrived. Eugene stood before the court, heart pounding like a drum solo, while the opposing side delivered their arguments with the enthusiasm of someone reading warranty terms.When it was Eugene’s turn, he leaned into the microphone and deadpanned, “I’ll keep this brief—mostly because I skipped breakfast.” The room chuckled, but beneath the humor, Eugene’s frustration simmered. As the case dragged on, Eugene faced each absurdity with his dark wit intact. “At this rate, Your Honor,” he said, “my grandchildren will be arguing this case for me. Let’s hope they’re better at it than I am.”

Victory was far from assured, but Eugene walked away with two things: the moral high ground—and a pretty decent punchline.

**A System Rigged for Failure**

By now, Eugene had cracked the code: this wasn’t one man’s struggle—it was a masterclass in systemic failure. The institutions supposedly built to protect workers and uphold rights were about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.Requests for help were met with a symphony of silence, a chorus of excuses, or the occasional crescendo of outright hostility. “Oh, the system isn’t broken,” Eugene mused, his exhaustion tempered by sharp sarcasm. “It’s a well-oiled machine, meticulously designed to grind people like me into a fine powder.”

The so-called safeguards seemed to have a single function: making sure that justice remained a rumor. Complaints disappeared faster than donuts in a break room, accommodations were treated like lottery prizes, and decisions seemed to be made with a Magic 8-Ball.Each step forward felt like being on a treadmill set to ""futile."" The harder he pushed, the faster the system found new ways to push back. “At this point,” Eugene joked darkly, “I should be charging them for the cardio workout.”The message was clear: the system wasn’t just rigged—it was weaponized. And Eugene, like countless others, was left wondering if the game was even worth playing. “They don’t want you to win,” he muttered with a grim chuckle. “They want you to give up—and I’d almost applaud the efficiency of their cruelty if I wasn’t the one paying for it.”

**Epilogue: A Snowy Fight**

Despite everything, Eugene stood defiant. His submission to the UN OHCHR wasn’t just a desperate move—it was a battle cry for every injured worker, every person with disabilities, and every marginalized soul ground down by the system. “The pen is mightier than the sword,” Eugene quipped, hoisting his stack of evidence. “Though honestly, this stack could do more damage than a sword if I dropped it on someone.”

Stepping into the snow outside the courthouse, Eugene tilted his head skyward, letting the flakes settle on his coat. “They say justice is blind,” he muttered. “In Canada, it’s also lost, confused, and apparently still using dial-up.”The bitter cold matched the frozen gears of the system he was up against, but Eugene pressed on. His fight wasn’t just personal; it was for every voice silenced by bureaucracy, every life upended by indifference. “They say you can’t fight city hall,” he grinned, “but nobody said I couldn’t file an international complaint. Let’s see them shuffle *this* under the rug.”

As the snow thickened, Eugene glanced at the courthouse one last time. “Justice may be blind,” he said with a grim smile, “but here, it’s also severely delayed, wearing earplugs, and probably stuck in a snowdrift.”But Eugene wasn’t about to give up—giving up was for people with better things to do, like having hobbies, peace of mind, or a functioning will to live.. “I’ll beat this system,” he said to himself, trudging back inside. “Or at least outlast it. Assuming it doesn’t kill me first. Honestly, place your bets.”With a stack of papers heavier than his resolve and a sense of humor darker than a Canadian winter, Eugene braced himself for the next chapter. “If I’ve learned one thing,” he chuckled, “it’s that laughter doesn’t fix anything—but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper than therapy.”",0,1738060830.0,legaladvicecanada,2,0.14,False

But hold up—here comes the jealousy part. I’ve been totally oblivious to what's been going on in the office for the past month. I mean, with exams coming up, I was so wrapped up in studying that I couldn’t care less. But today? I found out something that completely blew my mind.

My principal’s advance tax for FY 24-25? A cool **Rs. 10 crore**. Yeah, you read that right. And what was it for? **Gross F&O earnings of Rs. 55 crore** and the sale of an ancestral property in Gujarat worth **Rs. 20 crore**. Like, seriously. The man is out here flexing his wealth while I’m over here sweating it out over chapter notes and mock exams. No big deal, right? 🙄

I was feeling a bit *meh* the past few days, lagging behind, no motivation, wondering if I should just live off coffee and existential dread until May. But then this hit me. If my principal can pull off multi-crore deals while I’m stuck in Excel hell—*that* is the level of motivation I need right now. So, yeah, I guess I’ll just pretend like I’ve got a few crores sitting in my future to inspire me and get my act together. 💼💰

""The singularity is near!"" vows another, as his router coughs up ads for diabetic socks and divorce attorneys. The cognitive dissonance here isn’t a bug—it’s the founding scripture.

The threads metastasize into fractal nonsense. ""DeepSeek’s ethics framework vs. existential risk!"" they howl, a food fight in Plato’s cafeteria. Users dissect AI alignment like surgeons operating on smoke, their insights as durable as a screensaver. Every hot take is a confession: ""I need to believe something smarter than me gives a shit.""

I was dating a guy since last 9 months. we both 40+. We went on day trips, overnight, dinner, lunch, coffee and just movie and all. Shared so may things. Had a good intimacy between us. I was vocal abt my feelings fo rhim but he was bit reserved since beginning. Now he is gng overseas for 10 months and he was like I dont hv same feelings for you. Can we cherish all the memories we had togather and be 'good friends'? I dont want you to get attached to me. I dont know what to do now? ",0,1738060258.0,OnlineDating,1,0.5,False

This time I find it weird, because she lives within Manila naman pero pinagbabawalan daw siya ng jowa niya gumala (with us) to other cities like Makati, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Pasay or BGC — kahit mag coffee shop lang kami or gala sa mall.

Like?? Everything is so accessible to go to considering na nag g-Grab lang din kami.

Marami rin si girl pinag babawalan sa guy niya like playing PlayStation, watching concerts, and such.

But the weird thing is, all of these bawal bawal is somewhat “funny” and “cool” to them na parang ang proud pa nila na pinagbabawalan daw siya gumala and such like???

HINDI KO GETS. LEGIT QUESTION KINK BA YON HAHAHA

Kasi naiinis na kami na tuwing gumagala, lagi siya nag co-complain sa venue choices and laging gusto maaga umuwi.

1. Weather: How cold is it usually in the late morning to early evening? I get cold very easily as I’m from a neighboring temperate country, like i wear a light jacket in a 21C airconditioned room.

2. Insects: We will be doing a Doi Inthanon & Elephant sanctuary tour,do we need insect repellent? Are the insects mostly mosquitoes or do we also have to watch out for sand fleas?

3. Air: Has the burning season started already? We’re not very sensitive but just want to be sure.

4.Coffee: Best quality coffee/cafe in the old town/Nimman area? I understand there are a lot of nice cafes but I’ve watched someone in YT not being happy with CNX coffee in general.

5. Food: Street food recos please!! 

6. Bike: We would like an affordable bike tour around the Old town area, any recos? If not, just bike rental places that won’t scam us. 

7. Elephant Sanctuary: Do they provide slippers for us or do we need to bring our own?

Thank you!!😊 ",0,1738060089.0,chiangmai,4,0.5,False
1ibykyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1ibykyp/emergency_c_section_nicu_stay_led_to_extreme/,emergency c section + nicu stay led to extreme anxiety,"My baby is almost twelve weeks, and does not sleepin her bassinet. I had an emergency c section with her, and she was whisked away to the Nicu so quickly. My boyfriend didn't get to cut cord, I didn't get to hold her on my chest for ""golden hour"" I didn't get to hold her at all the day she was born, or breastfeed her. I wasn't even told what was going on by my doctors or anyone. They told me boyfriend and he's the one that told me she was being transferred to a hospital 40 minutes away. I asked to be discharged the day after my c section to go be with my baby at the NICU. Because of her traumatic birth and Nicu stay for breathing issues, I cannot let myself let her sleep unless i'm watching her breathe, or my boyfriend is watching her breathe. My boyfriend and I take sleeping shifts, making sure the other has been up awhile and is alert for a while and set up with coffee etc before the other sleeps. The awake parent will play with baby, feed, change and when she is asleep, hold her. I cannot sleep with my baby in her bassinet. I cant sleep knowing that me or her father aren't awake to watch her breathing. Please don't be rude. I know people are going to have the urge to tell me this isn't normal, and to seek help. I Know. I will be talking to my doctor about this but at the same time I don't think medication will alleviate my very real fears. 

I feel like my experience with her birth and her early days here severely impacted me, and who I am as a mother. I'm already and anxious person but now it's like 1000 fold. I am so anxious over her. I love her so much and I am so anxious over my sweet girl. And I'm still so sad for hoe events surrounding her birth ended up. I'm so so lucky that my girl is okay. I know other parents have been through similar and even worse circumstances. I feel guilty for being so sad and so anxious. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. maybe for camaraderie or commiseration or simply because I needed to get it out somewhere. ",4,1738059981.0,newborns,18,0.83,False

1ibykw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1ibykw1/lust_or_love/,lust or love?,"I can't stop imagining making out with my crush or having steamy and cuddling moments with my ex. I don't know what's wrong with me. It's hard for me to focus and be present in the moment because I'm always thinking about romantic situations. In other words I'm in my head a lot which I know is typical for on INFP. It feels wrong though to constantly think about these things but I can't control it. For example, recently I went on a blind date with this guy and we talked for a couple hours at a coffee shop. It wasn't the best conversationally and I did have some turn-offs but it was romantic and I thought he was cute. I could tell he was extremely nervous and very into me but he was also really straight forward with his intentions and asked to go on a second date which I thought was really attractive considering the fact he was so nervous (he is INFP if anyone cares). Although there were some cons, the more I think about that day the more I get butterflies and feel attracted to him. Now he is a full on crush and I barely know this guy. My point though is that I think I am confusing lust and love meshing the two together. I think I tend to think I like someone when in fact I'm just lustful. It feels wrong and I hate that I am this way but that's been the case for my whole life. I always fantasize about physical scenarios and moments with my crush ever since I was little. I don't know what to do about it and the way I am. I don't want to lead anyone on and I don't want to remain in the past. I do plan on going on a second date with him but also worry that my conflicting feelings will only deepen causing confusion and more anxiety which I already have.
