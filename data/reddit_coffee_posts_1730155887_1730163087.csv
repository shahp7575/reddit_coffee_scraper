1gei8iq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gei8iq,Real AND fake?!,"Hi everyone. I am so confused by the cups I bought recently. I splurged and bought 3 on eBay. I probably should have just purchased them at Target and made custom wraps on my Cricut.

I am (was üòÇ) not a Stanley girlie. I‚Äôm always late on trends because I want to see the quality bear out, although I have my dad‚Äôs Stanley thermos from the ‚Äò70s. I just wanted something to hold a lot of liquid and keep it cold. After drinking room temp water all my life, my new friend Peri M. Pause demands frosty beverages. I have Starbucks cold tumblers, but the coffee is warm after an hour. I have other stay cool cups, but they max out at about 4-6 hours, the ice melts, and the 30 Oz size is are hard to pick up without handles.

So I waded into Stanley world a bit ignorant. Just wanted 3 cups that keep liquid cold up to 12 hours ‚Äî 1 for water, 1 for coffee, 1 extra when the others are in the dishwasher. I was willing to pay for a Stanley because others had been $30 and not fit my needs. 

I assumed my first two were fakes, because they were only $50 for the Starbucks red. But‚Ä¶

# 1 - seems to fit all criteria for a real cup - hex screws, handle near the top, tumbler with arrows on inside bottom. I thought it might be fake for two reasons ‚Äî the red flaked off the bottom and liquid didn‚Äôt stay cool long, even when I added more ice and cold water instead of room temp. Pics 1-3

# 2 - was supposed to be holiday 2024 and shipping end of November, but then arrived last week. The printing is blurry/shadowed on the second cup, but it has the hex screws, tumbler design on inside bottom, and handle close to the top. I haven‚Äôt washed or used it yet. Pics 4-5

#3 - I figured the third was a real one with Hello Kitty wrap or engraving after market. Alas, it has the SUS marking on the inside bottom. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Most people think **boredom** is the problem, so they recommend finding hobbies.

Boredom is only 40% of the problem. The majority (60%) of the problem is **loneliness**.

The real reason why you can't break free from social media is because you are lonely.

# How do you solve it?

* **Ultimate Objectives**
   * Family (marriage, children)
   * Relationship with God
   * Friendships

# Tools to stop the doom loop

Your addiction is initiated and bolstered ***at home***.

* Audio
   * Radio (my fav)
   * Music
   * Podcasts
* Pets (if you don't have allergies)

# Spend less time at home

The less time you spend at home, the easier it will be to break free from your screen addiction.

* Stretch your social muscles and make new friends
* Initiate coffee meetups
* [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) or similar websites
* Church
* Volunteer

# Action Steps TODAY:

* Either buy a radio (recommended) or find an online station you like
   * Instead of watching something, put on a radio talk show or some music
* Go for a walk outside
* Go to a coffee shop (private-owned) and literally just say ""hi"" to someone",2,1730162831.0,digitalminimalism,0,1.0,False
1gei557,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipsOver35/comments/1gei557/i_f41_am_losing_my_boyfriend_35m/,I F(41) am losing my boyfriend (35M),"I don't know what to do. I feel selfish for wanting my own relationship needs to be met, like sex, having fun together, etc. 

The backstory: My boyfriend's sister has 4 kids. Her oldest son, from a different father, was excluded and physically and verbally abused by his stepdad, father of his three sisters.  Because of the abuse, he slowly developed violent behaviors. Because of the violent behavior, boyfriend's sister gave up on him and sent him to live with grandma, boyfriend's mom. The behaviors have escalated. A few times a week, he punches holes through walls and doors, or rips doors off their hinges. He beats grandma during his rages. My boyfriend is called up when this happens to calm him down and stop him from abusing grandma and destroying property.  When nephew gets into these rages, he doesn't recognize what he's doing. He's so filled with emotion that he can't be stopped. This has been going on for over a year. 

In the past year, grandma got guardianship, and boyfriend is a legal caregiver. Grandma is low income. She doesn't have the resources to send him to intensive treatment. He has a case worker with the county, and an IEP at school. Still, the behaviors just keep getting worse. And I see less and less of my boyfriend. We've stopped having sex. I think it's like once a month, if that. We used to go on weekends together. About once a week, we get dinner and watch Netflix, and that's about it. We don't talk as much during the day. I've bought him flowers, bought him coffee, I'm trying to be supportive, sending supportive memes and messages. But I feel like the severity of nephew's behavior is tearing us apart. He's called up almost nightly now. I love him dearly. If I had the money, I'd throw everything I have at helping nephew get better. I'm in between jobs and have stressors of my own. I listen and try to empathize as much as I can when he's venting to me. 

But I miss him. I'm seeing him less and less. We've talked about it. His response was that it's a tough time. It's been a tough year and it's going into a second tough year of this. We've been together for almost 4 years. He's exhausted whenever I see him, so I don't ask for much, mostly because I feel really guilty asking for anything when I know he's giving all he can. You only have so many spoons. 

What can I do to try to mend our relationship? Is it time to walk away? I don't want to lose him. But I don't want to feel so lonely in a relationship. ",1,1730162622.0,RelationshipsOver35,2,1.0,False

1gei2l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gei2l8/df83v2_game_changer/,DF83V2 Game Changer,"(Sorry so long)
Not everyone has been having the same problem I was having (for almost a year now), but I just had a breakthrough.  I'm now convinced that my DF83V2 was sent with either defective burrs or, at the very least, burrs that were not meant for espresso. 
I was having to grind at a setting just 2-4 ticks above burrs chirping to get shot timing even close to right. I even had a decaf that I could tell was good, but I really *couldn't* properly turn into espresso because I was scared of pushing the burrs closer together.  Lots of people tried to help, even Joe at espressooutlet was messaging with me and offering a few suggesions, but all of the advice ultimately boiled down to machine setup and burr alignment, both of which I knew were fine (I aligned those burrs multiple times and they were about as good as they were going to get).

I had a bonus coming up so I took a gamble and bought some SSP Lab Sweets... and that same decaf just choked the machine at a 15 setting.  I could almost cry ü§£ü§£ü§£.  I didn't want to play around pulling a ton of shots at this time of night,  but I got it pretty close to dialed at around 18 on a second pull and, while it was a little lighter tasting than I expected, it was still possibly the best cup of decaf I've ever had (https://september.coffee/products/wilton-benitez-colombia-decaf) and the burrs aren't even broken in, yet.

The only problem now is that I'm going to be completely starting over and re-dialing my whole thought process.  With the burrs I had in there before, the slightest movement of the dial went from choked to pulling too quickly and everything tasted ""ok,"" but often not quite what I expected. 

I'm not the type of person who's going to recommend that others should go spend almost $300-400 more on burrs for a grinder that already cost them $500-600, but boy did it just make my day and saved me from making an even bigger mistake of just ditching this DF83 and spending money on a Eureka or whatever other grinder would be the $1,000-1,500 ""next level up.""",1,1730162423.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Who‚Äôs the real b..ch?üòï,"I (F25)became friend with this girl(F23)in the United States, we were both there with the work and travel program. from different, but neighboring countries, where the same language is spoken. she had noticed that the girls I was sitting with were always talking behind my back, and that's how we got closer. in the states we had become very close, she listened to all my positive and negative experiences in life, I told her absolutely everything about myself, I was very honest and open with her. she was always close to me, we had a lot of fun together, but she was very reserved, she didn't say much about her life or her experiences. although I tried to get into the subjects, she always turned it around so that I could talk more about myself. at the end of the program we each left to our countries. we continued to talk, and after a few days she asked me if I could host her to my house for a few days because she wants to do her master's degree in my country, and until she gets accommodation from the university and until she solves the documents, she would like to stay with me . I agreed, even though I live with my fianc√©, I accepted without asking him. she came to me, although she said she would stay for 3-4 days, she stayed for 2 weeks. I started arguing with my fiance because we no longer had privacy in the house, she couldn't stay in the house for a day because she was bored and I had to go out with her non-stop, when I went out with her I paid because I felt sorry for her because she didn't have money, her family didn't have money, and I wanted to help her. food, everything, I paid for. I also gave her clothes that I no longer wore and also new... Iafter 2 weeks she left  in her country because she also realized that she had exaggerated, and came a month later when her documents were ready. she came here, I went to college with her on the first day, there she met a girl from the same country as her, became friend with her, and then I felt that our relationship was cooling. I didn't tell her anything, I thought she needed me and that was it. I was not angry, I understood the situation, I wasn't emotionally involved that much . after a month she texted  me and asks me how I'm doing, she asked me why I didn't talk anymore, because she thought I didn't want to talk to her anymore. I preferred to wait to see if she would still be the same after meeting that girl, that's why I didn't write to her anymore. She started to tell me that she has problems with that girl from her  country, that they don't get along (they lived in the same house, a house for students). and so we started going out again. here I was already thinking that this was the reason why she started talking to me again, but I said that maybe I'm paranoid. in the same way, we went out often, we talked almost non-stop, in general I paid when we went out, food, coffee, whatever we bought because she had no money. it was my wish, because it was very cold outside, and we had to stay somewhere. so I offered to pay . many times i bought food for her and take it to her place, if I cooked something I also give it to her. She could get a job, but during her college vacation she wanted to go to the states again for work during the summer, but the problem was that she didn't have the money to buy a ticket and pay the student agency. and of course she borrowed money from me, she even asked me to ask my mother if I didn't have it because shw knew that my mother has savings and also good salary. $2000. I knew she was going to ask me, that is, I felt it because I knew she had no money and neither did her family. I was already starting to feel used. even though we understood each other very well, we sat together when we went out for 8-9 hours, we talked about different subjects, psychology, science, politics, relationships, life, anything. we were never bored. we had the same opinions in general, and when we did not have the same opinions, we discussed and reached a common point. it was the most beautiful friendship I've had in my life. she always told me that I'm like a sister to her, that she doesn't know how to thank me for how much I helped her. When she was on vacation from college, and she had to go to her family, I would wake up at 4 in the morning to take her to the bus at 5 in the morning, so she wouldn't have to pay for Uber. She  went to the states again, we continued to talk. but she had a problem. she wanted to enroll in another college in my country, because that would help her to get her residence papers and to benefit from her citizenship. but she could not register because she was in the states. and who could help her? me, of course. for a week every day I ran dozens of km to solve with the college registration. her mother sent me her documents by post, and I looked for notaries, lawyers, to help me with the power of attorney so that I could submit the documents in her place for enrollment at the college. her mother also thanked me a lot, said she was praying for me because of how much I helped her daughter, etc. she came from the states, she brought me many sweets as a thank you, we went out to a restaurant and she offered to pay, but her attitude had changed a little. I felt that she was no longer the same person, I didn't feel so sincere anymore. I felt she had something different. since we met, she told me that she likes the way people approach me, that there is a difference between us when we go to a store or to a restaurant, that people talk to me and nobody  doesn't even notice her because I seem to have money, because I have expensive things and she doesn't and like in my country people put a lot of value on that. but it wasn't like that, I was simply more approachable because I always smiled and was very confident, but she always had a very serious face. she always complimented me, always admired me, liked my attitude, told me I have  something special.  she always told me that she loves money very much and that she wants to be rich. she told me that she would sleep with the money in her bed, and that she would be very stingy. I told her that I want to find my passion and earn so much money to help all those who don't have, and animals and homeless. always when I saw homeless I gave them money or bought them food,  she always looked with envy and only then said that she would like to have money to give to others too, and that I have a very good soul..but when she last came back from the states she was strange. She had bought two brand bags to make it look like she had money, when I wanted to pay, she said to pay when I will have  my own money (I wasn't working, I was still looking for my passion, but my fiance let me have his card with no limit, so it wasn't a problem of money). then I felt like I was going crazy, but I didn't say anything, it bothered me a lot, considering that when she borrowed money from me, she  didn't think that I ""don't have my own money"", or when I used my gas to go for her to solve her problems, or when I paid everywhere we went out. or one day, I was in the bathroom of a restaurant, and I was admiring her hair, a long and naturally blond hair. I told her never to dye her hair because she has gorgeous hair. and she told me that she is not that stupid to do something like that (I was dyed blonde). I was silent. I didn't want to end our friendship, I was sorry for the beautiful moments and the beautiful chemistry we had for so long. after some time, I went to another city to my family. we continued to talk on the phone and on social media, we sent each other pictures, everything was normal as before. we didn't fight, we didn't get angry, but one day she stopped answering my messages and didn't even open them. I wrote to her and asked her if she was okay, if something had happened. She  didn't answer. I saw for the first time that her mother was no longer following me on Instagram. and after a few days she answered me , telling me that she knows that I‚Äôm curious,  we are very different and that our friendship is over. that she thanks me for everything and that she doesn't regret our friendship. I answered ""you probably found a job"" , an she said‚Äù yeah, you‚Äôre right‚Äù that was all she told me. I was extremely hurt, angry, shocked, disappointed. I felt like a fool, used and abandoned. I answered her very badly, because I wanted to hurt her. I was sorry later, but that's it. I reproached her for everything I did for her, I told her that she was always jealous of me because I didn't lack anything and people paid too much attention to me and ignored her. I was bad, i know , but she  worth it at that time. she blocked me without saying anything. I will never forget. I never understood why it ended so suddenly, we didn't have a heated or awkward discussion, before the day she stopped answering me, we had been talking all day and sending each other funny tiktoks.",1,1730162376.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Finally trying meds and trying to decide if i should keep upping mirtazapine (i'm on 22.5 mg) or trial wellbutrin which is the other one my doc wanted to combine for depression. I'm a little worried about the possibility of increased anxiety w wellbutrin...but the part of me who is not  loving gaining weight with MIRT and wants to not be depressed any more is very curious about wellbutrin.



So far mirtazapine has gotten me to a muuuuch better place. Not crying all the time, jogging again...but still crying quite a bit and feeling pretty frozen and irritable. If I don't have to be present for my kids (which i'm not that great at right now anyway), I will just watch tv...forever.

Yet I also hate dread when i experience it...and its crippling just like depression is. I tend to have a super sensitive nervous system and stay in a sympathetic state most of the time (don't sleep much) so i've had to cut coffee, get on clonidine/mirtazapine/hydroxizine(this one doesn't do much)

I'm confused how to distinguish this anxiety vs depression...does one lead to the other? Are they hand in hand? How can I be both up and down? I'm exhausted.

A little of it still looks nice, a lot of it has been majorly scratched by dogs, and even some is mismatched where the previous owner did not stain the trim after replacing a door.

We would like to stain everything a darker color including baseboard, trim, chair railing, and doors. Possibly an espresso/coffee or mahogany. It doesn‚Äôt have to be 100% perfect, we‚Äôre just looking to replace some flooring and do some painting and if we can go darker on the trim, it would widen our options quite a bit and get a lot closer to what we want. I‚Äôm not even sure that whatever wood we have is best for this kind of staining, although we prefer not to paint it. 

I‚Äôm pretty new to this, but from my limited research, I see that the traditional staining method will not work with this without some aggressive sanding, which could ruin the details of the trims. Ideally, I would like to stain without sanding off all of the clear coat.  I‚Äôve been reading up on products like Polystain, which sounds like exactly what I am looking for, to darken the wood, hide some minor blemishes, and possibly sand and use filler on the deeper scratches, but Polystain seems to be mostly disliked in this sub. Is gel stain a better option? Any brand recommendations? Is there a better method altogether without carefully hand-sanding every piece of wood?

1gehny8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gehny8/how_do_i_23m_meet_people_for_potential/,How do I (23M) meet people for potential relationships without college? ,"Hear me out, I'll start off by saying that this might be popular question. I've looked at some of them and maybe have an idea but if you care for a long read I'll try to be specific about my situation. Although this is generally about meeting people, I think I'm currently focusing a bit more on the dating aspect.

I'm a 23-year-old guy living in SoCal. The main reason for my lack of connections is the fact that I took a very untraditional path with my education after high school. After graduating, I spent most of my time pursuing education/work online and only spent a few months in a in-person college. After getting laid off I've spent the past year grinding through an online university to get my bachelors within a year. Most if not all of my friends are people I've known online for about 6-10 years. I've never really felt lonely until I started thinking about how I've almost unintentionally been chronically online. I honestly don't think I lack the social skills to keep a conversation going, it's more about the opportunities and approaching part. I've been complimented on my looks being even better than my pictures and I like to think I'm at least average in appearance.

I've been trying to put myself out there more. I try to study outside at cafes multiple times a week; I sometimes visit random smaller events like farmers' markets and have spontaneously done stuff like finally visiting a rave/bar for the first time this past year. Problem being is none of these really lead to any socializing and it doesn't really feel natural besides stuff like chatting to sellers at booths. I've heard of¬†the site meetup¬†and I figured there should be a lot of events here in Cali/OC but they seem to generally be for people older than me. For some reason I also might have a weird perception of people using meetup, especially the singles/mixers events (I know I can't judge though). I also don't think I'd connect really well with people at places like bars, combining the fact that I don't like to drink.

I tell myself that dating apps are probably the solution, but I've recently learned that it's probably not for me either. My view of dating apps has been mostly skewed into it being a platform for hookups which discourages me from trying to pursue something real from it. The whole experience just feels very empty. But the thing is some of the people I've strictly met for hookups were the ones I've actually connected to the most on a personal/emotional level. I think it's because skipping all the small talk and upping the pacing of everything just lead to a deeper connection. Experiencing this is what sort of changed me from only wanting fun to wanting something serious.

As I'm currently just a full-time student focusing on grinding my degree, I'm wondering if I should just maybe pick up a part-time job that might allow me to socialize at least a little bit (coffee shop, boba shop, idk). My main hobby has been just playing video games but it's hard to find a social group/meetup for this. I've been thinking about picking up a pottery/language/drawing class but these are paid classes I'd have to think about. Maybe I can pick up a single class from a local community college? I'm not religious, but I also wonder if a more modern and social church is a potential opportunity too. My friends tell me that I shouldn't stress about these things and let it come to me, but I try to think objectively and tell myself that not having natural opportunities means I need to put in some effort.

tl;dr: school, work, and friends were all online which led to the lack of in person connections. dating apps are seen as a hookup app for me. meetups related to hobbies are weirdly difficult to find and have interest in. where do I organically make nice friends and find a potential partner? my growing age and lack of social opportunities is starting to daunt over me.",1,1730161266.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

Memory transcript subject: Sebastian Northrop, Terran refugee¬†

Standardized Human time: October 23rd, 2136



I shot up out of bed gasping for air‚Ä¶the blood‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt real!‚Ä¶I'm alive!‚Ä¶*fuck, why did I have to survive!?!* ***Why must I be without them?***



Yua must‚Äôve heard me wake up because before I could comprehend what was happening, I was being tackled into lying back down by a white fluffy blur! ‚ÄúOh, thank the stars you're awake!‚Äù she almost shrieked as her tail looked like a perfect curve.



‚ÄúY-Yua!‚Äù¬†I shouted back as I wrapped my arms around her, there were very few people I'd be happier to see!

I held onto her and couldn‚Äôt help but feel some tears start to well up, ***I'd be alone without her!***



She quickly dried my eyes whilst softly saying: ‚ÄúYou're safe Seb, everything's gonna be okay! Don't cry!‚Äù

The affirmations calmed me down a little but tears still swelled in my eyes as I could feel my cheeks grow red. *I was so thankful, no, blessed she's still here!*¬†



I gently stroked her wool‚Ä¶or tried to. I didn‚Äôt realize that my hand was bandaged until I felt that I couldn't bend my hand easily.

‚ÄúWh-what happened?‚Äù I choked out and she paused for a moment, I knew *something* had happened‚Ä¶*this‚Ä¶this wasn‚Äôt where I last was!*¬†



My confusion grew as I sat up and tried to remember what happened earlier when I was awake‚Ä¶*why was I here? Why couldn‚Äôt I just stay?* ***Why can‚Äôt I just see my family again!***

I could feel tears start rolling down my cheeks. 

‚ÄúIt doesn't matter! Your home and safe!‚Äù Yua comforted me.

I wanted to press further and ask what happened, but she looked like she was just about to cry herself. I didn't think I'd be able to stomach that sight. Slowly my good arm went around her for another hug and she embraced me back. *Why did everything have to hurt!?!*



With how much my back ached and felt like rusty gears coming back to life again, it felt like I was out of commission for a while, my internal clock seemed to concur that more than a day passed...



‚ÄúH-how long was I out?‚Äù I asked, shuttering against her.¬†

What little I remember of the day before ‚Äúyest‚Äù it felt like history was being made every hour‚Ä¶and not good history either.¬†



‚ÄúYou were out for three paws hun! Oh stars I was starting to worry you‚Äôd never wake up!‚Äù Her fur was feeling a little matted and dirty.¬†

I moved my head back and looked into her eyes.



‚ÄúMy god! Yua! Did you sleep at all?!?"" I asked, thankfully my own waterworks have stopped for now due to concern for my lovely space sheep.¬†

She sighed and her tail slowed. ‚ÄúN-no‚Ä¶I only got in a few naps as I didn‚Äôt want to be asleep if you woke up before me!‚Äù *She‚Äôs a lot more than what I deserve!*¬†



‚Äúoh, Yua‚Ä¶you didn‚Äôt have to,‚Äù¬†I said softly, not feeling like I was worthy of someone's dedication like that.

She just sighed and nuzzled right into me ‚ÄúI'm just happy you're awake!‚Äù¬†she beeped.

*I wondered what happened for those three days, though something told me I'd be better off not asking*. *Ignorance is bliss and I needed all I could get.*¬†



After some more hugging, I eventually felt *good enough* and asked Yua to let me get up. My leg was definitely feeling better, my shoulder still hurt if I bent it the wrong way, but at least it was feeling like I could take off the sling.



When I tried to leave my injured arm out of the sling, Yua forced it back, warning: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need that healing wrong‚Äù

I thought maybe she was overreacting but I wasn‚Äôt the one with medical knowledge, *she was.*



It took me a few steps to get my sense of balance back but soon enough I was back up and hobbling along. I managed to get a few steps in by putting some weight on my stabbed leg before Yua forced my crutch under my arm saying: ‚ÄúThe stitches could break if you put too much weight on your leg, your body will absorb them and the outside parts will fall off‚Äù

When my brain finally got itself sorted out, I remembered that back on Earth we were tinkering with the idea of such a medical marvel. But I guess it was as simple as bandaids to the aliens.¬†



I pursued the kitchen and at least it seemed like she was eating and keeping the place clean, just not herself.

‚ÄúGood to see that you were eating, but you need to take care of yourself too, Yua‚Äù¬†I felt bad that she would put my needs above her own, even if it was trying to be ready at any moment if I were to wake up.



*Lord have mercy on me if something happens to her!* She gave me a dismissive: ‚ÄúI know, I know‚Äù before handing me some kind of Venlil food.¬†



‚ÄúYou need to eat more, it‚Äôs been three Paws!‚Äù She put it next to the sink as I was more thirsty than anything and had a glass in my hand before even I knew it! *Nothing mattered at this moment, I needed* ***water! NOW!***¬†



I downed glass after glass before getting impatient and just cut out the middleman, putting my lips to the tap and drinking directly from it. Only parting with it once the primal urgency of feeling like death by dehydration faded.¬†



‚ÄúSomeone was thirsty‚Äù Yua teased as I dried my lower face with my shirt, trying to stabilize my breathing as I prioritized drinking over breathing for the most part.

‚ÄúYou could say that‚Äù Was the only reply I could think of before I started to wolf down the bland food. Thankfully with how I was starving, my brain tricked me into thinking it tasted amazing!¬†



‚ÄúHmmm, you should have a little more,‚Äù Yua said, opening the fridge again and pulling out the dinner I made that we never got to eat, at least it was my portion she was pulling out.



‚ÄúFine but you better not be fattening me up‚Äù I teased as I ate standing up again, Yua‚Äôs tail started wagging again seeing me pushing back the reaper by fueling myself again.



After putting the empty dish in the sink I slugged down a few extra glasses of water before feeling my body start to calm down and come out of ‚Äòsurvival mode‚Äô. *I think I‚Äôm starting to feel like my old self, my proper self, again.,*



I patted Yua before giving her some scritches under her chin ‚ÄúI got the best doctor\~‚Äù I cooed teasing her a little.¬†

‚ÄúHmm, only if my patient would keep himself in one piece\~‚Äù She looked up at me, her tail was still wagging but started to straighten out before she started to nuzzle into my hand and even head butt it a little before regaining her composure.¬†



‚Äúanything on the agenda for today?‚Äù I asked as the headbutting must‚Äôve made her dizzy seeing as she took a step back and held onto the counter.

‚ÄúJust some homework‚Äù She let out the cutest yawn and I gave in to the urges, running my fingers through the tuft on her head again.¬†

‚Äúyou should take a shower, not saying you smell but you're a little oily‚Äù



I said looking at how my hand was a little shiny now and felt slick. She seemed to get tense at that suggestion for some reason.¬†

‚ÄúPromise to not leave the apartment?‚Äù She asked, looking up at me with begging eyes.¬†



‚ÄúYeah Yua, I don‚Äôt have anywhere to go anyway.‚Äù I wondered why she felt the need to ask, did she expect me to just take off and hobble throughout the world? *‚Ä¶not like I have anywhere to go in this life.*



She didn‚Äôt leave for the bathroom until she saw me sit on the couch and set my crutch aside letting it lay on the floor.¬†



‚Äúshould probably put this somewhere neither of us will trip on it,‚Äù she said taking it and placing it next to the TV on the other side of the room, I found it a little strange that she‚Äôd put it there but she kept walking that direction heading to the bedroom/bathroom.¬†



The coffee table was cleared of all the snacks and in their places laid a laptop and two textbooks next to it, flipping through them it looked like a biology and medicine book respectively. Looking over the counter now that I wasn't starving and dying of dehydration, I saw some mail resting on the corner of it.



Fearing that Yua would come running out if she heard me get up without my crutch I waited until the water turned on and heard the water splattering on the shower floor as she tended to herself.¬†



With Yuatari distracted I hobbled as quietly as possible, grabbed the mail, and brought it back to the couch. It was still a little uncomfortable to walk on my own but I should be allowed to hobble around the house without the crutch!



Flipping through my haul, it looked like we were already getting some junk mail: a political ad, two letters for Yua, and one for myself. It was addressed as coming from the UN armed forces. 

It drove a stake of fear through my heart! *What could they want!?! Sure I guess I was a UN employee last I knew but‚Ä¶why can‚Äôt I just be left alone!?! EVERY TIME I GET UP SOMETHING COMES AT ME!!!*



I was filled with dread thinking I was being drafted! Ripping open the envelope and reading the paper inside, it wasn't a drafting in the normal sense. 

I was being required, *ordered,* to report to the UN offices in the city and return to work as a military arms designer as soon as possible.¬†



*If I don't report within two weeks I will be considered a deserter and there will be a warrant for my arrest and will be tried for treason!?! I sighed as I read it knowing that I had no choice, if I refuse, they're gonna toss me in a POW cell and leave me to rot, leaving poor Yua to be out on the streets. That's not something someone like her deserves!*¬†



I hadn't got a clue what day it was anymore, my phone was probably in the bedroom which with my current condition, I wasn‚Äôt feeling confident that I could sneak around that close to Yua, she‚Äôll already have a conniption once she notices the mail in my hands! *Hopefully, she won't be too mad!*



Seeing her fresh laptop I opened the lid only to see that it wasn‚Äôt in ‚Äòqwerty', hell, only a few of the symbols registered as letters! Thankfully it still showed the time and date in the corner of the start screen. It was the twenty-third already!?!¬†



Time flies when your life gets turned upside down and ripped inside out. I had until November 5th or else I'd get hunted down and dragged into becoming that bastard Sovlins' cell mate‚Ä¶*I didn't even know what that Captain Sovlin even looked like.*¬†



I had a flashback to when they were working us to the bone in the skunk-works, we were shown what was left of poor Marcel and told that this ‚ÄòSovlin‚Äô character was responsible. They didn‚Äôt even need to say anything as more before we knew it, Sovlin and the federation were all we talked about as it kept us going, it‚Äôs what kept us from being replaced‚Ä¶*was Sovlin even real or something made up to keep the dogma and fear running thick?*¬†



*W-wait! Oh god, I must be really losing it! Geild! Geild said that name! I still didn‚Äôt know what the bastard looked like‚Ä¶I don't even know if I want to‚Ä¶does it even matter?*



I found myself staring blankly at the paper, the sound of Yua stepping out snapped me back to reality. I couldn‚Äôt help but giggle a little at the soggy space sheep as she was still a little damp.¬†



‚ÄúFind something funny?‚Äù she scolded but I just waved it off before collecting myself.¬†

‚ÄúI see you got the mail‚Äù She sounded annoyed but didn‚Äôt really press me on how I got it ‚ÄúAnything good?‚Äù¬†



She asked, walking up to the couch before sitting next to me, her damp wool was getting water to seep through my shirt when she leaned on me. I wasn‚Äôt sure how she‚Äôd react to the news so I just handed her my draft letter. I could almost see the cogs in her head turn, I knew she had a translator implant since she could talk to me so she definitely knew what the letter said!



As she processed the letter I thought back to when we were forced to get our implants so we could understand the alien documents without wasting the time of translating, then deciphering them, I knew it was getting bad when the UN conglomerated all military contractors into one big powerhouse as ‚Äòwartime measure‚Äô.



Kinda felt like all the time I spent trying to learn German was wasted but the implants were a godsend when you had to converse with someone on the other side of the globe who seemed to not be faring any better than yourself.¬†



Rumors flew when the enforcers weren't looking: it must‚Äôve been getting dire and we were only delaying our annihilation. There was more speculation that the UN was using the aliens to scare us into giving them more power. Those were the two biggest as they seemed the most realistic, and looking back, they weren't too far off.



Fear has been used since time immemorial to gather power, make people scared, say ‚ÄúI can fix everything!‚Äù, do a little show and the people are eating out of your hand. But a power-hungry head of state wasn't the energy that Elias Meier projected, I couldn't help but feel that his familial posturing of ‚Äògrandpa Meier‚Äô was the only thing keeping humanity cohesive on the home front.¬†



My deep thoughts faded when Yua put her head on my thighs whilst yawning, guess I'm her bed tonight. She rolled and looked up at me so she could give me an attempted smile, it still didn‚Äôt look natural but she was trying.

‚ÄúSomeone needs a nap‚Äù I teased petting her head.¬†

‚Äúhmm, and this pillow is self-heating‚Äù guess I'm being trapped now by a cute speep.¬†



I just gently rubbed her head and shoulders as she fell asleep and I soon found myself feeling tired already. Hopefully, I'll be back in operational order by the time the deadline comes.

Turns out Stiizy has been poisoning us, they are not the only ones, and the licensed legal dispensaries are the ones that have been peddling these brands to us. I have only had a few Stiizy products through the past few years, and am glad I did not buy into their marketing hype.

I stuck to the ‚Äúgood‚Äù products, but the market has still betrayed us. I remember when Kushy Punch was caught doing a very similar thing. 

I‚Äôm not a extremely heavy consumer, but I like to have a full stock, and go through a good quantity between myself and friends that drop by - maybe an ounce of flower and a quarter ounce of wax/oil per month.

I (28) am a bi woman. I met a lesbian (25) woman on a dating app 2 years ago. We went on a date and hit it off really well. We kept talking online but never really made time to meet up as she was busy with university and I was working a lot building my career. So we just stayed friends. I ended up meeting a man and dated him for a few months, which I was upfront about with her. We even met up for a pride event where he insisted on joining and ended up leaving early because he was uncomfortable. A few more months go by, my relationship ends with said man and I meet up to go to a drag bar with her. She confessed her feelings for me and I reciprocate, we hooked up that night. We started spending more time together but by early 2023 she was enrolled in another accelerated university program and I just started a new job that was a huge step up in my career. Same thing happens, we chat but don't make plans to meet.


 I had deep feelings for her, she was the first person I ever connected with at that level. Stupid me, I got scared and came up with all these reasons a relationship between us wouldn't work. We both never communicated our feelings and we both had a lot of mental health struggles last year. My best friend committed suicide last summer, I didn't want to burden her with my trauma and she ended up ghosting me last October. I got hung up on her but I didn't have a way to reach her so I just tried to move on. I then started therapy this summer to work on myself. 


Almost a year later she finds one of my social media accounts and starts watching my videos. I end up sending her a friend request and she accepts. I message her wishing her well, saying I'd love to still be in her life if she'll have me. She messages me back and tells me how she felt like she was on the sidelines waiting for me to like her, she felt really low so she stopped talking to me. I send her a message explaining why I never pursued it, how I started therapy and was able to figure out my fears and where I failed. I said I still had feelings for her, I apologized to her and asked if she was comfortable if she'd like to meet for coffee so we can talk. She's read my message but hasn't responded, I think she's processing it still.


I hope she meets with me but I understand if she doesn't end up wanting to. If she does, I want to be fully honest with her about everything. Therapy has been helping a ton and I'm ready to hold myself accountable for the pain I caused. I would love the opportunity to try again, but for real this time. She is such a wonderful person, she is intelligent, funny, so kind, selfless and absolutely breath taking. It took a lot of work for me to process comphet but I now understand myself a lot better, and I'm so mad at myself for letting such an amazing person go because of my unprocessed trauma. If she does give me another chance, how do I even prove to her I am better. I know actions speak louder than words but as someone with a lot of distrust I feel like anything I say or do will sound like bullshit. I feel like such an idiot for even hoping for another chance knowing I don't deserve it. I'm crazy about her and I just wish I could prove that I mean it. Any advice, or even just a come to Jesus moment that I need to move on. Something. I don't have many people in my life that I can be open with about this, thanks for reading my story book if you made it this far.",0,1730161166.0,LesbianActually,1,0.5,False

1gehfrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gehfrp/was_i_a_bad_boyfriend/,Was i a bad boyfriend :( ?,"Im gonna try to be through and explain both sides of the story, but basically

I (23m) just got dumped by my (24f) for various reasons 4 weeks ago :( And it is a long story and id like to know if i was a bad boyfriend or she was not seeing my worth.

To start of we were in an LDR for a year, im from a european country and she is from Turkey. And for the second half the relationship i was taking classes and having hobbies while she was ""stuck"" at her parents house studying on her own for an exam, without much to do. She was very sweet and kind most of time, sometimes would be a bit childish with some silly games, but it was mostly because of LD. Plus i had my faults too and i still love her to bits. The post maybe seem negative, but think about it as if all the time i dont mention here is time when things were great. So there is still quite a bit of it. When i mention events its usually 1 or 2 weeks of that month, execpt july.

We met on a dating app sort of by accident and hit it off immediately, the first few months of the relationship were made up of texting everyday for long periods of time in the summer. Then we decided to start dating at the end of september. she had shown some behaviour i didnt like, like being mad at me for not anwsering a text for too long, showing she could be anxious, and also a me having a female bestfriend was quite a problem for her because i apparently had talked to much about her already (i later learned this is something you shouldnt do with women) regardless she refused to let it go.  She stopped being as anxious as time went on which was great.

The relationship went on without too many hiccups until **December**, where she started asking me to be more honest about things and asking how i felt about her weight etc... But then being angry with me for telling her she could be in better shape, just like i could anyways. She would put me in difficult places to give an anwser she was happy with. This really marked because i felt i couldnt be honest with her.

She later apologized for this behaviour an it improved.

**January** i spoke to my female bestfriend i apologized to her, because i had been distancing myself from her due to pressure of my gf. She wasnt a good friend and got at mad at me as well, which led to me not talking to her. Despite this my gf was angry at me apologizing to her, because she was had some attention seeking behaviour, even though i never had any intentions with her or otherwise.

**February** we met up for the first time i gave a ""promise ring"" she gave some crochet things she made which i appreaciate a lot. i payed for almost everything, the hotel we stayed in and my tickets, only some meals were split or payed by her and a gift or 2 we gave to eachother. And she behaved quite badly in some ocassions, when we met everything went well, but when we were intimate there were some issues from my part because I was nervous. She got very upset over how things went down and made me feel ashamed, because she also felt I was making her feel that way, like she wasnt good enough. She pressured me to post things on social media, despite me saying i wanted to and i would, she kept asking me when and telling me to do it, which sort of traumatized me and me not want to do things on social media at all from then, i stopped posting at all because of her (i still posted the pics with her).  Also we went out with her friends and they kept speaking turkish a lot of the time and i felt left out. I thought i was going to be okay with the situation, but i later realised it wasnt good. I gave her a plastic rose for valentines day and she thanked me for it but complained it wasnt real flowers, even though she didnt have anywhere to put them (more on this later) She snooped trough my insta.

also my parents divorced literally when i came back from this trip :) :(

She genuinely apologised later for some of these behaviours but they left their marks sadly.

Now having these things happened i started to become insecure in the relationship sadly and sort of losing my way a bit. Around March or April she randomly started sabotaging the relationship for 2 weeks. But she realized it on her own and said she understood if i broke up with her. And i said i loved her and i would stay.

With all these things on my mind and my failure to communicate how they truly made me feel i became insecure in wanting to continue the relationship, but secure it would continue for the things i had done for her and because i loved her. I would avoid talking about the future because it made me uncomfortable, and i couldnt reassure her about the future of the relationship, only about the present which made her uncomfotable obv :( Whenever we had arguments i would mention how we were arguing too much and it wasnt good, and love should be easy etc... which started happening beyond this point sadly.

**May** she tells, she feels i deserve better and she feels bad for being distant among other things. And then when i respond saying how i feel and the doubts i have she deletes her texts and says how her love was not enough when that wasnt true at all. I had doubts, but i never seriously considered leaving or began checking out. My insecurities were strong, but my love was always stronger.

**July** we had a conversation, and i was rude to her, i said she didnt have any drive because she had stayed at her parents a whole year and hadnt tried to find a way to make money despite needing it. And i really hurt her, and i more than anything wish i hadnt said those things. Because she was getting a job in Istanbul and moving there soon. I just used the opportunity to vent that almost year long frustration. Also in july we had our aniversary of when we met, and neither of us had time to do something. She said she had something planned but couldnt get to it and i said i was sorry but i didnt. And i thought we could just spend some time together. She was mad at that despite not saying it. Around this time we also had a conversation about how were quite different and i was feeling like that was apulling us away a bit, that made her very sad.

Then also my female friend contacted me, and thats when our friendship actually sort of ended despite the fact we hadnt spoken in 5 months, but my gf still wasnt happy that we kept following each other. And that was where i drew the line. I told her if there was any chance me and my friend would speak again i would like to keep it that way and not fully burn the bridge because i dont enjoy doing that. But she never understood that.

So july shook everything very hard, but were going to meet up again in August and i kinda felt it was make it or break it.

**August** was overall chill, she was very busy moving and so was I. And the time for the trip came.

I brought her earrings. I stayed at her new house with 2 other female roomates it was very chill, and after a few days while we were intimate she said she wanted to loose her virginity with me. So we did it together. It was a huge milestone for me because i had been very patient with her with it up until now since there wasnt something like that in my culture. Not only that this trip was so much better than the last, we were much happier together and things worked way better, the social media thing came up again but it was okay. Then because i was fucking stupid and saw a story of my female bestfriend, despite the fact we werent talking anymore at all. She got upset and started arguing with me until she finally asked if she was a good enough reason to cut off a friend. To which i said no. And to which i stand by in most contexts, but in that case, the friendship was dead :( i should have just done it.

Anyways its getting quite long, but after that i left a few days later came back, we were mostly fine overall, and then she started her job, started distancing herself for 2 weeks i tried talking to her but she said she was busy, and then suddenly broke up with me :( I sent her real flowers 4 days before she broke up with me btw, and she thought they were plastic, which hurt me a lot :(

TD;LR She says she broke up with me because of the things that happened in July (check post), the whole year long thing of my female friend, despite me only meeting up with her once or twice at the start of the relationship for coffee, and not having any intentions with her at all. Me being rude once. And the fact i was starting some of my insecurities in the relationship not let me commit :( But she did plenty of things wrong too and i never gave up on her, at least no fully and not suddenly like she to me. I supported her trough what she claimed was ""the worst year of her life"" And when she finally got a job and a house, she left me :(

In the end i recognized my mistakes and wanted to continue with her but she doesnt want me back :(",2,1730160651.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

The aged, decrepit State Theater on Main Street in downtown Culpeper has been closed since a screening of Free Willy a few years ago, but the cryptic messages come and go, each as inexplicable as the last:

SCHOOL FOR AKTERS

SPYCRAFT: A GREAT GAME

FREE MONEY

Nestled in the Virginia piedmont at the foothills of the Blue Ridge, Culpeper is a real estate agent‚Äôs fantasy, one of those picture-perfect places that always top lists of America‚Äôs best small towns. Quaint restored buildings, history winking around every corner, peace and quiet‚Äîall within commuting distance to Washington. But since the freakish messages began appearing, it‚Äôs become a postcard with a question mark in the middle. Nobody ever sees how the blue block letters actually end up on the decayed art deco movie house; the words seemingly materialize overnight as naturally as the morning dew, no telltale ladder in sight. A message‚Äîif that‚Äôs really what it is‚Äîmight remain for as long as a month; then, without rhyme or reason, it vanishes‚Äîonly to be replaced by another:

ATARAXIA

In Culpeper, where everybody knows everybody, these disembodied messages from God-knows-where have been the talk of the town for more than a year, inspiring as much contempt as conjecture. For every local watching the marquee to test his word power (‚ÄúI look up everything they put up there, but ‚Äòataraxia‚Äô wasn‚Äôt in the dictionary‚Äù), another is convinced his intelligence is being insulted (‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as free money‚Äù). Others discern a diabolical plot, swearing it‚Äôs Satan playing a one-sided game of Scrabble that Culpeper is sure to lose (‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to mess with our minds‚Äù).

Culpeper gradually realized it had a cult within its bucolic midst. After much head-scratching and compounding of rumors, it became apparent that the messages were being sent by the Finders, a secretive utopian group that over the decades has made its home in various places around the Washington area, most recently in Culpeper. Who the Finders are and what they are doing in Culpeper is a deeper mystery. Did the Finders buy the theater just to have a billboard with which to freak out the locals? Nobody knows.

And while no one can remember exactly when they first came to town, the Finders have kicked up almost as much paranoia as the Yankees did when they invaded more than a century ago.

In appearance, the Finders‚Äîmostly middle-aged men, always in dark suits‚Äîwouldn‚Äôt be out of place managing a local funeral home. But the behavior of the handful of adherents has people wondering whether they arrived by flying saucer. Townspeople say the Finders constantly walk the streets, following people home and taking extensive notes and pictures. They often appear at local council meetings, never saying a word but simply observing the scene. At other times, they plunder the visitor‚Äôs center of brochures, maps, and local travel guides. And they haunt the courthouse, scouring land deeds to find out who owns the local real estate.

The town police say that whatever the Finders are up to, it‚Äôs not illegal. Naturally, though, rumors fly: Did you hear what the Finders are doing at the old theater? They‚Äôre planning a stage production of Paradise Lost‚Äîwith an all-nude cast. Or was it a gay burlesque version of Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy? Were the Finders gathered for some ritual in the back lot, or were they simply taking trash to the dumpster? People have seen glowing lights in the windows of the Finders‚Äô group house at the edge of town, along with visitors coming and going at odd hours. The lawn is mowed in a peculiar circular pattern: That‚Äôs the place where they sacrifice pot-bellied pigs.

No one in Culpeper, or anywhere else, can tell you with any certainty what the Finders really are, but the threat they seem to pose is to convention, not public safety. The best guess suggests that the Finders are a waning cult of merry pranksters with roots that go back five decades. They are perhaps a dozen men and women who own property in common, make a hobby of tweaking people, and apparently have taken a liking to the town of Culpeper. Culpeper hasn‚Äôt bothered to like them back, treating them like the local version of the Addams Family.

This isn‚Äôt the first time the Finders have become a template for people‚Äôs fears. Less than a decade ago, the Finders made national headlines and became the subject of a full-blown media witch hunt. In February 1987, police arrested two men traveling with six children in Tallahassee, Fla. Authorities discovered the group living out of a van in a park; the men were well-dressed but the children appeared dirty, unkempt, and disoriented. The men told the cops they were taking the kids to a school in Mexico; it turned out they were members‚Äîalong with the children‚Äôs mothers‚Äîof the then-D.C.‚Äìbased Finders. The cops didn‚Äôt know what to make of it, but they didn‚Äôt like what they saw. The men were charged with misdemeanor child abuse, and the children were taken into state custody.

Authorities raided the group‚Äôs Glover Park duplex and a warehouse in northeast D.C. and staked out several rural properties outside Culpeper. They seized piles of documents, computers, and software. Nothing illegal was uncovered, although investigators were impressed by the array of high-tech gear in the old fish warehouse off Florida Avenue NE.

But among all the cryptic inventory, cops found a photo album entitled ‚ÄúThe Execution of Henrietta and Igor,‚Äù a series of snapshots depicting berobed adults and children slaughtering goats in a wintry woodscape. One photo depicted giggling toddlers pulling dead kids from a womb (‚ÄúBaby goats!‚Äù ran the caption); another showed a grinning adult presenting a goat‚Äôs head to a startled child.

A little blood, along with the accusations of child abuse, lit a media wildfire led by the Washington Post, which ran three front-page stories on the Finders. There were intimations that the Finders were actually agents for hire, led in lock step by a former Army intelligence officer. The New York Times reported that ‚Äúsome have described [the Finders] as a bizarre cult of devil worshipers.‚Äù

You‚Äôd have thought the Finders had been tried and convicted of killing Bambi: A group of nobodies who liked it that way was suddenly the hottest cult in the U.S.

They may not have been spooks or satanic goat-killers, but the secretive communal group was also no bunch of dummies. The two dozen members had been thriving outside the mainstream for years, pooling their resources and raising kids in a free-form family. They enjoyed life on the fringe and even though the investigation put a spotlight on them, they weren‚Äôt about to step out into the light of day. Instead, they sparred with reporters in mock interviews and leaked fake ‚Äúinvestigative leads‚Äù about their activities. The episode was a fever dream, stoked by media reports that turned out to have no basis in fact. The group deftly kept the mystique level cranked up and simply waited for the heat to die down.

It worked. The child-abuse charges were dropped; the feds backed off, the children were returned to their mothers, and the Finders returned to their mysterious activities, eventually fading from the media‚Äôs freak-of-the week radar screen.

Throughout the controversy, group founder Marion D. Pettie remained the central but unseeable character in an ever-changing cast of followers. During the ‚Äô87 scandal and its aftermath, even though he was apparently calling the shots, Pettie was nowhere to be found. Until now.

He calls himself the Stroller, and locals tell you there‚Äôs not a street in Culpeper that Marion Pettie hasn‚Äôt walked a hundred times. They say he‚Äôs hard to miss on his morning constitutional, when he ambles down busy Main Street past Gayheart‚Äôs Drug Store, where regulars crowd the window counter for breakfast and gossip. Others have seen him at odd evening hours, pausing leisurely in front of houses, sometimes taking notes, but mostly just watching. Always watching.

They say he has the bemused expression of someone who‚Äôs seen it all but can‚Äôt stop looking.

Always in a suit and tie, Pettie is a tall, impressive figure, the quintessential Southern gentleman out taking the air. He carries a wooden cane, but there is an athletic spring in his step that renders the cane more prop than walking stick. Though quick to nod a greeting, he is apparently immune to the small-town pleasantries that afflict his fellow pedestrians.

Locals may treat him like an alien abroad, but Pettie was born and raised in Culpeper; he‚Äôs lived there on and off for years. Still, while other native sons have been content to head the Elk‚Äôs Club, Pettie‚Äôs been busy leading the Finders.

Sometimes Pettie stops by the theater, always accompanied by a Finder; some say he watches movies in the empty auditorium. He makes frequent treks to the local library, but only after first sending ahead a scout. Pettie is also a regular down at the courthouse, sitting quietly and taking notes on the proceedings.

Last winter, though, Pettie was more than a spectator in those chambers. He and the Finders were being sued by nine ex-members demanding their shares of the group‚Äôs assets, an estimated $2 million in property and cash that had built up over the years.

In many ways, Arico vs. The Finders is like any other chancery case: former associates bickering over money. But the suit also provides an unprecedented glimpse into the workings of a secretive group that has mostly avoided the mainstream.

More than anything, Arico vs. The Finders tells the saga of a utopian community that went sour. Soon after the ‚Äô87 incident, most of the female members left, taking their children with them. A few years later, several long-time Finders departed. Now down to a handful of members‚Äîand apparently only two women‚Äîthe Finders are disappearing.

The Finders are still listed in the business section of the D.C. phone book, but the line just rings endlessly. So I‚Äôve gone to Culpeper on a drizzly April morning to find the founder of the Finders. Locals tell me Pettie could be anywhere in the world right now‚Äîprobably in some warmer clime waiting for winter to end‚Äîbut he always comes back. They assure me that if I meet Pettie on the street, he‚Äôll be only too glad for a chat, despite his reputation for elusiveness.

Down Main Street at the State Theater, the marquee is blank. Have the Finders run out of messages, I wonder, or have they run out of members to put up the damn things in the middle of the night?

The theater is closed, but two flanking window offices provide passers-by with an intriguing tableau. Taped on one of the doors is a tiny placard: ‚ÄúTHINK.‚Äù Both rooms have a variety of office props: desks, couches, an upside-down map of the world, a disconnected computer, an antique manual typewriter, a dusty old set of Encyclopedia Britannicas, a rack of welcome brochures and pamphlets. Every object is artfully placed in its own discrete space. The only clue that this is a Finders‚Äô office is a piece of paper on a window sill, perched like some official document. It‚Äôs a copy of a U.S. News & World Report article about the Finders from January 1994. Headlined ‚ÄúThrough a glass, very darkly,‚Äù the story details the ongoing Justice Department investigation. A passage is highlighted: ‚ÄúThe group‚Äôs practices, police said, were eccentric‚Äînot illegal.‚Äù

The paper is turned upside-down‚Äîaway from the street‚Äîso you have to crane your neck to read it.

As I‚Äôm reading, I hear something. For the first time in my several visits to town, there‚Äôs someone stirring in the darkened bowels of the theater. From the sidewalk, I watch an elderly man shuffle to the window and take a seat. He‚Äôs got on a worn white T-shirt, baggy pants, an oversize belt, and sandals and socks. Ever so carefully he arranges his situation in simple, deliberate gestures. Satisfied everything‚Äôs in order, he sips from a steaming mug, lights a cigarette, and adjusts an earplug hooked to a transistor radio.

Though I‚Äôm only a few feet away, the man doesn‚Äôt pay me any mind. When I knock on the door, he jumps to attention and opens it graciously. Up close, he looks like a man who‚Äôs been kicked around by life: An arm is missing from his heavy-framed glasses, he‚Äôs got a gap-toothed smile, and his face looks like a bruised orange.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for Mr. Pettie,‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where Mr. Pettie is,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just drinking my coffee and listening to the news.‚Äù

I ask him if he‚Äôs a member of the Finders.

‚ÄúI just joined the group,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just came down here from Pennsylvania and they put me up here.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know if Mr. Pettie‚Äôs in town?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wasting your time asking me where he is, because I don‚Äôt know. I just got here from Pennsylvania and needed a place to stay. You could go by the house to check to see if he‚Äôs over there.‚Äù

He gives me the address of the Finders‚Äô group house a few blocks from downtown.

I nod my thanks as he returns to his morning coffee.

Across Main Street, a block away, I stop by the former Medical Arts building, an imposing brick edifice that once housed the offices of local doctors and dentists. Now that the Finders own it, the whole town wonders what goes on inside. In one of the windows is a glowing plastic Halloween skull; from the sidewalk, I can see a large map of the U.S.‚Äîthis time right-side-up‚Äîon a wall inside the entrance.

Peering in the front door, I‚Äôm startled by a seated person in a dark business suit, back turned to the entrance, reading a magazine. Is this a Finder, or maybe a security guard? On closer inspection it turns out to be a mannequin topped by a ghoulish rubber mask and wig‚Äîa homemade dummy to entice curious passers-by.

On the edge of old town I pass the gargantuan Culpeper Baptist Church, which takes up an entire block; from its immaculate front lawn sprouts a marquee announcing: ‚ÄúWHERE YOUR MONEY IS, THERE IS YOUR LIFE AND LOVE.‚Äù

At the top of a hill, overlooking Culpeper on a quiet corner, sits a spacious two-story brick house. Its lawn has been allowed to grow semiwild, and the back yard is enclosed by a tangle of bushes. But in the daylight at least, there‚Äôs nothing even remotely creepy about this house, as inconspicuous and tidy as any other in this neighborhood of grand homes and mansions. I climb up the well-kept porch‚Äîchairs in a neat row‚Äîand knock on the front door. There‚Äôs no answer, so I look through the window. In the vestibule, a small globe sits upside-down on an oriental rug in the middle of a wooden floor. The glowing orb is plugged into a nearby wall socket. Against the bare wall is a couch covered by a white sheet; an upside-down bowler hat rests on top. Behind it leans an early-1900s photo of a formally dressed couple‚Äîwoman standing, man sitting‚Äîapparently a wedding portrait.

Like the theater front, the scene is less eerie than weirdly inviting. I knock several more times, but the house is quiet and apparently no one‚Äôs around. As I head back down the steps, I glance back to see if anyone‚Äôs watching my departure.

That‚Äôs when I notice, hooked on the back of a porch chair, a wooden cane.

The people of Culpeper, along with the rest of the world, found out a few things about the visitors in their midst during court testimony last winter. (Still pending in Culpeper Circuit Court, the case is now in the hands of a commissioner who is reviewing hundreds of pages of testimony and boxes of documents.)

At their peak in the ‚Äô80s, the Finders boasted nearly three dozen people in their experimental community: Based in various domiciles around Washington and headquartered in the converted warehouse off Florida Avenue, they played an elaborate ‚Äúgame‚Äù run by Pettie, the ‚ÄúGame Caller,‚Äô‚Äô traveling the globe as free-lance journalists, computer consultants, and information gatherers. They pooled their finances and shared property. Women assumed positions of power in the group, whose goal was to form an extended family based on mutual trust rather than blood relations‚Äîto ‚Äúlearn and earn‚Äù and raise ‚Äúfree‚Äù children.

The group‚Äôs roots stretch back to a pre-WWII Washington, D.C., open house run by Pettie when he was an Army sergeant. There, he claims to have become a full-time student of human nature. ‚ÄúI rented two apartments about 55 years ago,‚Äù he testified at the court proceedings, ‚Äúand opened them up for anybody that wanted to come in, and the idea in my head was that they were going to teach me something about power, money, or sex.‚Äù

Experience was the only teacher Pettie ever respected; he quit school after the ninth grade. ‚ÄúI consider my whole life an education, and that‚Äôs all I do is work on my education. I dropped out of school because it was interfering with my education.‚Äù

Pettie told the court he‚Äôs never had a real job: ‚ÄúNot unless you call being a cult leader full-time employment. I haven‚Äôt had any.‚Äù And yet when pressed to declare himself a cult leader, he replies, ‚ÄúIt would be more appropriate if I said I was a cultural leader, if I‚Äôm a leader.‚Äù

In his testimony, Pettie describes the Finders as a modern-day Narrenschiff, or ship of fools: ‚ÄúAbout 500 years ago, it was very common for ships to take persons that are nowadays called neurotics or psychotics and keep them moving, and they found that it was very therapeutic‚Ä¶.That‚Äôs one of the ideas that I had here, that people, if you kept them moving, they were better off‚Ä¶.‚Äù

At least eight members are active in the group, according to Pettie‚Äôs testimony; he claims the lawsuit has only strengthened the loyalty of those remaining. Insiders say the group is greatly diminished from its glory days: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a shadow of what it was,‚Äù says a former member. But it‚Äôs by no means dormant; Finders operate various companies in the D.C. area. Until last year, members ran a firm called Global Press out of several offices in the National Press Building. And despite its diminished size and power, the group continues to confound those trying to discover its inner workings.

Wendell Minnick, author of Spies and Provocateurs: An Encyclopedia of Espionage and Covert Action, has spent two years researching the Finders. Minnick has given up his project after running up $1,000 in phone bills and running into too many dead ends. ‚ÄúThe Finders would love you to think they‚Äôre a CIA front, but I would say they‚Äôre really nothing,‚Äù says Minnick. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to hear a lot of bullshit on the Finders, because they lie. These are dysfunctional adults, but they‚Äôre all working their asses off. They‚Äôre constantly working on some project. If you have a cult, the best way to control people is to keep them busy, to keep their minds occupied‚Äîif you have people standing around doing nothing, then they start thinking.‚Äù

Still, there‚Äôs always just enough tantalizing information to link the Finders to the spook underworld, clues never fully substantiated and yet never disproven, either. Author Mark Riebling skirts the topic in his 1994 book, Wedge: The Secret War Between the FBI and CIA: ‚ÄúJust before Christmas 1993, both agencies were embarrassed by a Justice Department investigation into whether the CIA had improperly used the FBI to cover up its connections to a computer-training cult called Finders, which had been accused but acquitted of child abuse.‚Äù

I (28F) met a guy (35M) on a dating app, and we chatted for three months before meeting in person. It was clear he was really into me; he love-bombed me with messages saying he missed me and that we were a perfect match. However, I noticed some red flags.

He had immature moments, like blocking me just to see how long it would take for me to reach out. The first time we planned to meet, he canceled last minute to go to a relative's birthday party. He rescheduled a few dates, which made me feel he was insecure. He also made comments suggesting he didn‚Äôt feel good enough for me, such as, ‚ÄúYou said you like me, but what does that mean for when we meet?‚Äù

When he withdrew, it was frustrating because I had to pull words out of him to understand what was wrong. He often ghosted me.

The next time we were supposed to meet, he canceled again, saying it was too late after an unplanned visit to a tourist spot. This felt suspicious, but I didn‚Äôt want to judge him too harshly. We eventually met for a brief evening, and afterward, he texted me that I was ‚Äúbetter than he expected,‚Äù which seemed promising.

However, he began to text less frequently. His only suggestion was for me to come to his place, which I declined because I was unsure of his intentions. Eventually, he withdrew completely. After three months of no contact, I jokingly messaged him, ‚ÄúSo, that's it? You don't miss me anymore?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúMaybe I thought of you a couple of times, but I didn't get the chance to know you well enough to miss you.‚Äù I ignored that and asked what went wrong, but still received no answer.

Three months later, I wished him a happy New Year and suggested we meet for coffee as friends. I thought he might have assumed I wasn‚Äôt interested, even though I was just cautious. I asked if he had met someone else, assuring him it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if he had. He replied he thought he found someone, but that turned out not to be the case. Once again, I was met with ghosting.

When I suggested meeting to discuss things, he said he appreciated that I still thought of him but wasn‚Äôt sure. I told him I was willing to make things right, but it takes two, and since he didn‚Äôt want to participate, I wouldn‚Äôt reach out anymore. I wished him well, and he liked my message two days later, which confused me.

Now, he‚Äôs messaged me again, but I‚Äôm refusing to respond. I‚Äôm conflicted. Was it wrong to stop reaching out when he seemed so avoidant? Should I respond to his latest message, or am I justified in my refusal given his behavior? AITA for not responding?",1,1730160168.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False
1geh98x,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1geh98x/roommate_from_hell/,Roommate from Hell,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm sorry for the long post, but I recently began to think about this roommate I had a few years ago. 

Back in 2021, I was 19(F) and just broke up with my abusive High School boyfriend. After 4 years together and swearing we would be married, he cheated on me and I finally drew my line in the sand and kicked him out. Being a broke college student who now was having to foot the bills of two people, I turned to the only friend I had made from work, since I wasn‚Äôt really allowed friends other wise. This girl was a class A manipulator, which I had not yet realized. Everyone around her was an enemy and if anyone disagreed with her, she would demonize them to anyone who would listen and victimize herself. I, however, just thought that like me she was in a bad situation and needed a roommate as badly as I did. 

Upon moving in, she would never clean anything. She would pile dishes up in the sink and then make slick comments to me about how ‚Äúsomeone really needs to do the dishes.‚Äù She would pile moldy food and dishes in her room and refused to share any of the food she bought, keeping it in MY mini fridge in her room, while helping herself constantly to the food I bought and kept in the kitchen. When I mentioned maybe making a chore chart so we could share chores evenly, she cried and said that she was neurodivergent and making plans like that stressed her out and that if everyone would just clean up after themselves there would be no issues. But I guess that meant only me cleaning, because not one time in the six months of her staying there did she clean a single dish or clean up the common areas. 

She would bring home pets constantly claiming they had nowhere else to go but then would refuse to take care of them, buy them food, clean up after them, or take on any responsibilities. 

In the six months she stayed there, she only paid her portion of the rent and utilities 1 time, paid half of her rent the second month, and I never saw another dime from her. We both worked at the local grocery store and would buy things we needed when we got off, and she would throw expensive things into the buggy like new rugs, coffee machines, makeup products, and then would walk away once we got to the register. She never helped me pay for any of it. 

She would even go into my room when I was gone and help herself to my clothes, blankets and other things. She would steal sweaters and hide them in her closet or at her boyfriend‚Äôs house. She wouldn‚Äôt even wear them out of fear that I would see her wearing them and take them back. She even stole my vintage 90‚Äôs comfort childhood blanket. It was one of those fleece throw blankets that was inverted on the back. I believe it was a biederlack brand blanket, or something similar. My mother received the blanket as a gift from her mother when she was pregnant with my brother, 5 years before I was born. It has been in my life since and I slept with it every night. When I discovered it missing, I found it in her room and asked her about it. She said that she couldn‚Äôt afford a blanket and I had so many so letting her use this one blanket shouldn‚Äôt be an issue and accused me of being selfish for leaving her to fend for herself without a blanket at night. I agreed to let her use it temporarily expecting it back eventually. I understand it was a mistake on my end, but she was really really good at playing the victim and making you feel like the most evil person in the world for trying to set boundaries. The blanket had a big cat on the front with fish bones wrapping around the boarder and I have been unable to find one similar since. 

She said me and another of our friends were alienating her because we liked to go for walks at night around campus to get out of the house for free and she didn‚Äôt want to. We decided to go out to eat one night, and while we were leaving she asked where we were going. She cried and invited herself along, despite not having the money to pay me rent for months at this point. After eating I had went to the restroom, in that time the waiter had brought out the checks and she told him that I was paying for our meals, and received both of our items on my check. She had ordered an expensive drink and appetizer on top of her meal, while I ordered something off of the deal menu because I did not have the money for extras. 

Before she moved in, I had $5000 in my savings, and by the end of the semester, I was completely broke and going into debt. I had to end my lease and move back home, dropping out of college and having to take a year off to work and save to go back to the college in my home town. I lost all of my scholarships, so my degree that originally would have been a full ride has now ended in me accumulating $20,000 in student loan debt, but I will be graduating spring of 2025 üéâ

In the end, she victimized herself and villainized me and our other friend, alienating us from the friend group we had, saying we left her out on purpose and bullied her around the house. She also kept the iced coffee machine she made me buy and the rugs she made me buy for her along with many of my own personal items. 

I haven‚Äôt spoken to her since, but she has literally scarred me from ever wanting another roommate ever again. I recognize that I should have stood up to her, refused to buy the things she forced me too, and made her pay rent, but she basically became a squatter in my own house, and the friend she victimized along with me moved in and slept on the couch and tried to help pay for half of rent and utilities with me, despite not having a bed room. She‚Äôs still my best friend to this day and I will love her forever for being by my side in the lowest point of my life, but literally we still talk about the PTSD we got from our roommate.

1geh7rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1geh7rj/oocs_odvm_special_event_inevitable_or_in_denial/,OOCS - ODVM Special Event: Inevitable Or In denial? Ch 1,"The behemoth that was the *Crimson Tear* crossed the void of stars in silence. Space was silent after all, and the massive engines emitted no noise outside of her hull. Deep in the black, off the edge of the map in the depths of wild space it could be a very lonely place. While many parts of Wild Space bustled with life and activity, just as many places were truly a galactic no man's land. Too far out of the way, or lacking in resources, phenomena of scientific interest or even rocks with the vague potential to be habitable to make a place a good base for pirates.

Today however, she did not cross the void alone.

Her usual consort, the *Audacious*, was out on patrol, and the frigate *Gutripper* was flying wing for the much larger vessel. Normal enough. Less normal was the vessel that almost massed as much as the *Crimson Tear* herself. The heavily armored bulk of the second *Dauntless* class vessel, the *Inevitable*. The people of Earth had sent out a fact finding mission. The information that had come back from the wider galaxy was too strange, so wild that it beggared belief.

Or so the representatives of the Earth said.

In Jerry Bridger's opinion on the other hand, it was simply the governments of mankind getting a look at the galaxy outside them, the blinders finally falling away, and realizing just how small they were in the grand scheme of things.

The entire Human population could cram into a single large spire on Centris. If it was limited to Humans only instead of including any alien family those Humans might have picked up, it wouldn't even be the most populous spire on Centris.

The numbers were shocking, and rational Human minds struggled to comprehend them. There was a reason that one of the Human teams who did analysis of such things in Diana's intelligence section had adopted the Cheshire Cat as their mascot.

Because we're all mad here.

So the *Inevitable*, allegedly arranged to be more 'loyal' to Earth, somehow, had been sent, and with them had come the leader of the mission, Observer Wu. A former Hong Kong police inspector who had been selected as, pretty much literally now, the most objective individual that could be found on Earth. He would be the one to be Earth's eyes and ears, to confirm what the *Dauntless* and the Undaunted had already sent back.

Jerry had done an interview with Observer Wu previously. Purely surface level, an introduction. This meeting was a bit less cordial.

""So... You've promoted yourself to Admiral from commander. An impressive rise to power.""

Jerry raises an eyebrow. An interesting place to start.

""I didn't promote myself to any grade. Admiral Cistern promoted me to captain on taking command of this ship, a rank warranted by commanding a vessel of this size with thousands of crew and civilians aboard. The Undaunted admiralty board then promoted me to admiral based on my actions in service to the Undaunted, and Humanity.""

Wu nods, taking notes for a moment.

""Do you hold these things are one and the same?""

""I do.""

""Why does Admiral Cistern and your Undaunted get to determine what's best for Earth?""

Jerry considers for a second.

""Did you allow your children to vote on supper when you were raising them? Or your grandchildren as I believe you are a grandfather.""

""I am, and no, I did not.""

""It's just the same. Every single man and woman who departed on the *Dauntless* had mutually exclusive sets of orders from the various powers that be on Earth. I myself had no fewer than fifteen contradicting orders from various portions of the United States government, and messages, offers and further similar 'orders' from no less than ten world powers, and a further twenty attempts to subvert me from the previous twenty five. I was offered immense wealth and power to serve these various small minded entities on Earth and in following Grand Admiral Cistern I rejected all of them.""

""And earned yourself great wealth and power in the wider galaxy instead, I see.""

Jerry keeps his face as impassive as Observer Wu's, the police interrogator was coming out, but Jerry wasn't exactly a stranger to interrogations.

""If my marrying well is somehow upsetting from an Earth perspective, Observer, I'm afraid I can't do anything about it. I married a wealthy woman, and as you know, once you have wealth it is very easy to acquire more wealth with the right opportunity.""

""An opportunity you earned off of data from Earth.""

There it was. That's where he'd been driving to.

Jerry folds his hands, shifting himself to a slightly more comfortable position in his office chair.

""Most genetic sequences I fairly acquired, complete with contracts ensuring I have the right to use them in the wider galaxy, weren't subject to any form of exclusivity or copyright to start with. Those few that did, I paid for, again, with a signed contract. If they wish to renege on those contracts my wife's corporation will happily see them in court. As a galactic business entity, and to have any hope of enforcement against an entity that holds no citizens of any nation on Earth, that will of course require them making the appropriate applications in galactic court. Probably on Centris. I'm sure our lawyers will look forward to receiving the subpoena.""

Wu simply takes a note, clearly he'd responded more or less as the other man had expected.

""Still Bridger, you have to admit that one man holding exclusive rights...""

Jerry holds his hand up to stop Wu.

""Begging the Observer's pardon, but no one in the wider galaxy holds any form of copyright or hold over baseline Earth genetic material. We have copyrights on unique strains we've created, like the Hyper Malinois that the Undaunted are using as military working dogs and police K9s, but anyone who wants to, and can acquire the appropriate data, can clone themselves a Belgian Malinois.""

""...I see."" He writes a sharp, aggressive note on his table. ""I apologize Admiral Bridger, it seems one of my legal counsels got ahead of themselves or perhaps got confused.""

""Galactic law can be like that. Our fairly small conglomerate maintains law offices on retainer in a thousand individual star systems and a hundred odd broad stellar nations such as the Apuk Star Empire, or the Mekken Reach. Thankfully everyone has to do that so the cost to establish a relationship with a good firm upfront is quite small, and the annual retainer is very manageable.""

""...""

Observer Wu takes another few notes and mutters to himself. Jerry didn't catch all of it, but was fairly certain he heard the word 'absurd' at least once.

""I suppose we'll set that issue aside for now then. Returning to the subject of your defection from Earth to the Undaunted...""

""The Undaunted are a pan-national, pan-galactic Human and Earth focused organization first and foremost, so I will disagree with the description of what I, or any other member of the *Dauntless*'s crew, have done as 'defecting'. We followed orders. We remain ready to follow legitimate orders from the Earth on behalf of the Human race.""

""...And of course any single nation acting only on its behalf's orders would not be legitimate.""

""Of course. Admiral Cistern formed the Undaunted because we needed actual political power to complete the only true mission objectives we had when we left Earth. Make first contact, easily done. Confirm the nature of the galaxy outside of 'Cruel Space', again, simple enough, and if the galaxy has potential for Human advancement, to prepare the way for all mankind to leave Cruel Space. That one‚Äôs a bit more difficult. However, we are continuing those missions to this day.""

""So the conquest of say, the world of Vucsa 5 advances Humanity somehow?""

""A habitable, stable world ripe for Human colonization certainly seems like it advances our mission. As does terraforming the world we received from Cannid Solutions. We've done all sorts of things, a lot of it in the name of making friends, and as I'm sure you know from your days in Hong Kong, having friends in a rough neighborhood is the difference between life and death.""

""What personally have you done to advance your mission? If you are indeed so loyal to it.""

Jerry smiles, he'd gotten the Observer on to his pace. He was winning this part of the match at the very least, especially after making Wu concede one of his initial points.

""I've secured several critical alliances for the Undaunted and Humanity, as well as negotiated a massive mining concern, an entire star system, joining the Undaunted. I believe you know Admiral Cisten's plan for a series of relay stations at the border of Cruel Space to receive outbound parties and ease their transition to galactic space... and more importantly keep colonists safe from any predators that might want to take a bite out of them.""

Jerry reaches out and holds up the plate that had his mostly eaten lunch on it.

""That mining concern can provide enough materials to make a new machine Earth, never mind some space stations. More important in my mind however is with the help of my family's business, I have proliferated Human goods throughout large swathes of the galaxy. Earth meat is now associated with 'quality', if not 'luxury' and Humans have become all the more real for a galaxy that didn't actually believe in us for a long time there. Probably still don't in many places. Thanks to my wife Sylindra's work, Humanity can be associated with something more than just a hologram, or story. It can be as real as a piece of steak in your mouth. That had to come from somewhere. Why not Earth?""

""Why not Earth indeed...""

Observer Wu steeples his fingers for a moment, considering.

""So what happens if Admiral Cistern stops being beneficent? Stops looking out for Earth?""

""Then he'd be voted out of office. We're an odd looking democracy, but the Undaunted is, at its heart, a democracy. If he seized power as a dictator, I'd give anyone aboard ship who didn't want to leave the chance to go back to Centris, and then with anyone left we'd go independent and try to continue the work on our own. I believe very sincerely in this work, Observer. A hand was extended to us from out of Cruel Space. The Dauntless clasped that hand. The Undaunted are how we reach back into the darkness to pull out anyone who wants to come.""

A sip of coffee and a smile for the observer.

""I believe I'd have a pretty solid crew remaining if Admiral Cistern did something that foolish, but I don't think he would. Humanity selected its first ambassador to the stars well. He took an absurd situation by both hands and I'll be damned if he isn't wrangling it enough to let us do what we can for those we left behind.""

The full color image of the Apollo 11 Lunar Plaque had been cleaned up significantly from the slightly grainy original, gleaming in the light of Sol.

""The words on this plaque mean a great deal to me. They did when I signed up for the *Dauntless* project, they do now. 'We came in peace for all mankind', and now, as the Undaunted, we continue to come in peace for all mankind, in the hopes of helping every single Human who wants to leave, get out of Cruel Space.""

""You'd leave the Earth depopulated?""

""If enough people want to go, why not? As you've seen, Observer, there are miracles while you wait out here. While the technology and resources Admiral Cistern has already sent back with the Lance flights will no doubt drastically improve the living standards for all of humanity, it's nothing compared to immortality and eternal youth as a lifestyle choice.""

they've made me very uncomfortable on numerous occaisions and you can't even be like ""hey would you please hand wash my pans?"" or move something in the fridge because she will accuse me of hating them and they'll get so mad and just yell at me. they yelled at me because for basically just existing and wanting space like the kitchen to myself when i cook which i always do usually when they arent even there and it isnt for more than 15-20 min but will huff and puff if i happen to be in the kitchen when they wanna make something because i asked for space. they always say ""let's communicate in a healthy way! (:"" and then when i approach them calmly about something they yell and ramble and then just lie to me about how im calling them names and overreacting when im the one sitting there not speaking. they tell me that she blacks out when that happens and the look in their eyes is scary like she has crazy eyes. i get they didnt have a great home life before we moved in (ive known them for many many years) but now they are just taking all of that anger out on me and projecting a bunch of therapy talk onto me while proceeding to be the face of someone who definitely HAS NOT gone to therapy.

and what's worse is that it would cost us both very little to move out and to have a different apartment in the same building just by ourselves in studios. would be just a teeny tiny bit more in rent, too. but this person claims that they simply don't have the money to do that, even tho its a solution where we will both be happier. all they do is spend money getting a coffee everyday, eating out for like every meal, buying expensive stuff so i think its all bullshit. worst part is that i cant move out of this apartment with them unless they sign off on it too and move somewhere else or have enough money to stay in that apartment. they could choose to buy out and move somewhere else but thats obviously out of the question. and they wont do it because they say they cant afford to do that when it literally would be their eating out/expensive stuff budget so im basically trapped in this lease with them until the end of the summer. i wouldn't be able to do a buy-out either and the apartment transfer was such an amazing, cheap offer and they are simply not making it happen because they are lazy. i'm constantly stressed and upset and they make me afraid to leave my room. my mental health has declined so much and is only getting worse. i cry everyday and drive hours to my parent's house most weekends (i ahve to stay during the week) just to feel a little comfortable for a few days. 

i dont know what to do. im trapped and miserable. i dont know how i'll survive until end of the summer.",1,1730159988.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

I would‚Äôve gotten individual bags and made my own but I‚Äôm on a budget. What I‚Äôve decided on at this point is a bag of coffee for him to try that has really good reviews, a little book I‚Äôm going to fill out that‚Äôs called ‚Äúwhat I love about you‚Äù, I also want to make a little thing I saw on Pinterest; it‚Äôs a little slide out box and when you open it it says you stole my heart and I‚Äôll paint and cutout a little anatomical heart to put in it, also I got him a card that I‚Äôll write a little note in. I‚Äôm also making his favorite cake and taking him out to eat to a nice restaurant but that doesn‚Äôt feel like a real gift to me. I think I feel like the gift isn‚Äôt good enough bc there isn‚Äôt anything he can use day to day. I mean the coffee he‚Äôll drink and then that‚Äôll be that. The book and little handmade thing are cute but yk just going to sit there. The last gift I got him were some shorts from a brand he really likes so he wears them to the gym all the time, and a little multi-tool he uses every now and again n I felt really good about that gift. This time I am not feeling the same. Idk if it‚Äôs because I feel like everything is just sentimental things and I‚Äôve got the idea that he won‚Äôt like them bc he‚Äôs a guy and would rather have something practical that‚Äôs not going to take up space.

I (28F) met a guy (35M) on a dating app, and we chatted for three months before meeting in person. It was clear he was really into me; he love-bombed me with messages saying he missed me and that we were a perfect match. However, I noticed some red flags.

He had immature moments, like blocking me just to see how long it would take for me to reach out. The first time we planned to meet, he canceled last minute to go to a relative's birthday party. He rescheduled a few dates, which made me feel he was insecure. He also made comments suggesting he didn‚Äôt feel good enough for me, such as, ‚ÄúYou said you like me, but what does that mean for when we meet?‚Äù

When he withdrew, it was frustrating because I had to pull words out of him to understand what was wrong. He often ghosted me.

The next time we were supposed to meet, he canceled again, saying it was too late after an unplanned visit to a tourist spot. This felt suspicious, but I didn‚Äôt want to judge him too harshly. We eventually met for a brief evening, and afterward, he texted me that I was ‚Äúbetter than he expected,‚Äù which seemed promising.

However, he began to text less frequently. His only suggestion was for me to come to his place, which I declined because I was unsure of his intentions. Eventually, he withdrew completely. After three months of no contact, I jokingly messaged him, ‚ÄúSo, that's it? You don't miss me anymore?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúMaybe I thought of you a couple of times, but I didn't get the chance to know you well enough to miss you.‚Äù I ignored that and asked what went wrong, but still received no answer.

Three months later, I wished him a happy New Year and suggested we meet for coffee as friends. I thought he might have assumed I wasn‚Äôt interested, even though I was just cautious. I asked if he had met someone else, assuring him it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if he had. He replied he thought he found someone, but that turned out not to be the case. Once again, I was met with ghosting.

When I suggested meeting to discuss things, he said he appreciated that I still thought of him but wasn‚Äôt sure. I told him I was willing to make things right, but it takes two, and since he didn‚Äôt want to participate, I wouldn‚Äôt reach out anymore. I wished him well, and he liked my message two days later, which confused me.

Now, he‚Äôs messaged me again, but I‚Äôm refusing to respond. I‚Äôm conflicted. Was it wrong to stop reaching out when he seemed so avoidant? Should I respond to his latest message, or am I justified in my refusal given his behavior? AITA for not responding?",2,1730159395.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

What gets me is how petty and ridiculous this is. They‚Äôre trying to cut corners by making us pay for our own water, yet they just renovated the executive lounge and added fancy coffee machines. It‚Äôs like they couldn‚Äôt care less about the fact that people need water to function properly. Not coffee, not another ‚Äúemployee morale initiative,‚Äù but actual, life-sustaining water. But I guess that‚Äôs not worth the investment?

The worst part is they framed it as ‚Äúpromoting personal responsibility.‚Äù Really? Since when does staying hydrated equate to personal responsibility, and why should it come out of my pocket?

1gegxdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gegxdp/what_do_you_think_about_this_friendship_i/,What do you think about this friendship? (I apologize for the grammatical mistakes.),"I became friend with this girl in the United States, we were both there with the work and travel program. from different, but neighboring countries, where the same language is spoken. she had noticed that the girls I was sitting with were always talking behind my back, and that's how we got closer. in the states we had become very close, she listened to all my positive and negative experiences in life, I told her absolutely everything about myself, I was very honest and open with her. she was always close to me, we had a lot of fun together, but she was very reserved, she didn't say much about her life or her experiences. although I tried to get into the subjects, she always turned it around so that I could talk more about myself. at the end of the program we each left to our countries. we continued to talk, and after a few days she asked me if I could host her to my house for a few days because she wants to do her master's degree in my country, and until she gets accommodation from the university and until she solves the documents, she would like to stay with me . I agreed, even though I live with my fianc√©, I accepted without asking him. she came to me, although she said she would stay for 3-4 days, she stayed for 2 weeks. I started arguing with my fiance because we no longer had privacy in the house, she couldn't stay in the house for a day because she was bored and I had to go out with her non-stop, when I went out with her I paid because I felt sorry for her because she didn't have money, her family didn't have money, and I wanted to help her. food, everything, I paid for. I also gave her clothes that I no longer wore and also new... Iafter 2 weeks she left  in her country because she also realized that she had exaggerated, and came a month later when her documents were ready. she came here, I went to college with her on the first day, there she met a girl from the same country as her, became friend with her, and then I felt that our relationship was cooling. I didn't tell her anything, I thought she needed me and that was it. I was not angry, I understood the situation, I wasn't emotionally involved that much . after a month she texted  me and asks me how I'm doing, she asked me why I didn't talk anymore, because she thought I didn't want to talk to her anymore. I preferred to wait to see if she would still be the same after meeting that girl, that's why I didn't write to her anymore. She started to tell me that she has problems with that girl from her  country, that they don't get along (they lived in the same house, a house for students). and so we started going out again. here I was already thinking that this was the reason why she started talking to me again, but I said that maybe I'm paranoid. in the same way, we went out often, we talked almost non-stop, in general I paid when we went out, food, coffee, whatever we bought because she had no money. it was my wish, because it was very cold outside, and we had to stay somewhere. so I offered to pay . many times i bought food for her and take it to her place, if I cooked something I also give it to her. She could get a job, but during her college vacation she wanted to go to the states again for work during the summer, but the problem was that she didn't have the money to buy a ticket and pay the student agency. and of course she borrowed money from me, she even asked me to ask my mother if I didn't have it because shw knew that my mother has savings and also good salary. $2000. I knew she was going to ask me, that is, I felt it because I knew she had no money and neither did her family. I was already starting to feel used. even though we understood each other very well, we sat together when we went out for 8-9 hours, we talked about different subjects, psychology, science, politics, relationships, life, anything. we were never bored. we had the same opinions in general, and when we did not have the same opinions, we discussed and reached a common point. it was the most beautiful friendship I've had in my life. she always told me that I'm like a sister to her, that she doesn't know how to thank me for how much I helped her. When she was on vacation from college, and she had to go to her family, I would wake up at 4 in the morning to take her to the bus at 5 in the morning, so she wouldn't have to pay for Uber. She  went to the states again, we continued to talk. but she had a problem. she wanted to enroll in another college in my country, because that would help her to get her residence papers and to benefit from her citizenship. but she could not register because she was in the states. and who could help her? me, of course. for a week every day I ran dozens of km to solve with the college registration. her mother sent me her documents by post, and I looked for notaries, lawyers, to help me with the power of attorney so that I could submit the documents in her place for enrollment at the college. her mother also thanked me a lot, said she was praying for me because of how much I helped her daughter, etc. she came from the states, she brought me many sweets as a thank you, we went out to a restaurant and she offered to pay, but her attitude had changed a little. I felt that she was no longer the same person, I didn't feel so sincere anymore. I felt she had something different. since we met, she told me that she likes the way people approach me, that there is a difference between us when we go to a store or to a restaurant, that people talk to me and nobody  doesn't even notice her because I seem to have money, because I have expensive things and she doesn't and like in my country people put a lot of value on that. but it wasn't like that, I was simply more approachable because I always smiled and was very confident, but she always had a very serious face. she always complimented me, always admired me, liked my attitude, told me I have  something special.  she always told me that she loves money very much and that she wants to be rich. she told me that she would sleep with the money in her bed, and that she would be very stingy. I told her that I want to find my passion and earn so much money to help all those who don't have, and animals and homeless. always when I saw homeless I gave them money or bought them food,  she always looked with envy and only then said that she would like to have money to give to others too, and that I have a very good soul..but when she last came back from the states she was strange. She had bought two brand bags to make it look like she had money, when I wanted to pay, she said to pay when I will have  my own money (I wasn't working, I was still looking for my passion, but my fiance let me have his card with no limit, so it wasn't a problem of money). then I felt like I was going crazy, but I didn't say anything, it bothered me a lot, considering that when she borrowed money from me, she  didn't think that I ""don't have my own money"", or when I used my gas to go for her to solve her problems, or when I paid everywhere we went out. or one day, I was in the bathroom of a restaurant, and I was admiring her hair, a long and naturally blond hair. I told her never to dye her hair because she has gorgeous hair. and she told me that she is not that stupid to do something like that (I was dyed blonde). I was silent. I didn't want to end our friendship, I was sorry for the beautiful moments and the beautiful chemistry we had for so long. after some time, I went to another city to my family. we continued to talk on the phone and on social media, we sent each other pictures, everything was normal as before. we didn't fight, we didn't get angry, but one day she stopped answering my messages and didn't even open them. I wrote to her and asked her if she was okay, if something had happened. She  didn't answer. I saw for the first time that her mother was no longer following me on Instagram. and after a few days she answered me , telling me that she knows that I‚Äôm curious,  we are very different and that our friendship is over. that she thanks me for everything and that she doesn't regret our friendship. I answered ""you probably found a job"" , an she said‚Äù yeah, you‚Äôre right‚Äù that was all she told me. I was extremely hurt, angry, shocked, disappointed. I felt like a fool, used and abandoned. I answered her very badly, because I wanted to hurt her. I was sorry later, but that's it. I reproached her for everything I did for her, I told her that she was always jealous of me because I didn't lack anything and people paid too much attention to me and ignored her. I was bad, i know , but she  worth it at that time. she blocked me without saying anything. I will never forget. I never understood why it ended so suddenly, we didn't have a heated or awkward discussion, before the day she stopped answering me, we had been talking all day and sending each other funny tiktoks.",1,1730159256.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I am sure there will be a few folks who recognise the phrase, ""Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?"" But for those who don't know, it was part of a series of graffiti about an unidentified murder victim that was forcefully ensconced in a wych elm around Hagley, Worcestershire. Some say she was a prostitute from Birmingham who disappeared three years prior the discovery. Others say she was connected to a German spy. It was a mysterious and haunting case that had plagued our community since 1943, and to this day, many don't know what really happened, who the culprit was or who this ""Bella"" was. Well, no one but me. I know the truth, and the truth is that there lies a darker story behind a woman in the tree. And although I do not think it is exclusive to the town of Hagley, I am positive that anyone who has experienced what I have will understand the mutual fear and dread. Perhaps this confession is a cautionary tale of sorts. Perhaps I'm speaking to an empty crowd. Here is the truth.

There was never a ""Bella"" at all, not that I knew of. The mysterious woman's name was Kornelia. Her last name though? No one knew. She was may be enigmatic  when she was alive. But as far as I know, she was a Polish Jew who fled her homeland during the occupation of Nazi Germany during 1939. Kornelia was... an odd woman to say the least. She was never sociable, and whenever she was, she spoke with a quiet, shy tone. You could distinguish her from the crowd; she was very short (I believe she was around 5'0), had these jagged teeth when she smiled, and had a wide neck. She never went out that much, but when she did, it was mostly at nighttime. It was peculiar by that time. 

I did not speak to her as much when I was a young lad. There was not much to speak to her about, and to be honest, I found her a little strange. That was until I started to notice her nightly routine. Some nights, I would look through the window and see Kornelia walk out her front door. I remember she had a candle lantern and she would look up at the sky. Depending on whatever she saw, she would either stay home or go for a short walk. It hadn't been too long before a few folks noticed this behaviour, and one day, I volunteered to go confront her. It was the last time I spoke to her.

It was the Autumn of 1941; I was 15 that time. I had visited Kornelia when day broke, and as I arrived at her doorsteps, she looked delighted to see me. She and I were the same height.

""Oh hiya, Henry,"" she greeted in fluent English. 

""Good morning, ma'am,"" I replied. ""I was wondering if I could talk to you perhaps."" When hearing the request, Kornelia seemed a little hesitant. I notice she was caressing her tummy in an anticlockwise motion.

""Is there something wrong I did?"" 

""No. Well, not that I know of. I just wanted to talk.""

She nodded slowly as if she was thinking. ""OK. Come in. Do you want tea of coffee?""

""I'm fine thank you.""

The interior of her house was just like any other in Hagley. Nothing out of the blue. That day; it was a bit messier, but who knows. It might have always been that way. I saw photos of her with her family, her as a little girl, and her holding hands with a man. We had never seen her with anyone when she moved here; perhaps she wanted to keep those aspects to herself. I didn't bother asking her that. We both sat on two birch chairs facing each other, and Kornelia grabbed her cup of tea and stirred and drank. 

""So, what is it you wanted to talk about?"", she asked as she smiled. 

""Well, I don't want to come off rude, but I have been noticing your habit,"" I said calmly. 

""My 'habit?'""

""Yes ma'am, your habit. You tend to go for a walk at night."" Her smile faltered a bit. ""Is everything alright? Some of the folks have noticed this too.""

She stirred the tea again. ""Yes dear, everything is fine. I was hoping to keep this a secret."" Kornelia looked at me as if she was worried about me. Before I got to ask another question, she stood and went somewhere. ""Stay here,"" she told. ""I need to give something to you."" I complied and sat, and I waited for her until she came back with a flat box. She sat again and opened the box, and she got out a wooden crucifix. 

""I want you to have this,"" she said. 

I looked at her, confused. ""Why?""

""For protection.""

""Protection from what?""

""Henry, do you ever notice how strange the moon is?"", she questioned. 

I shook my head. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""The moon. Do you feel as though it's 'watching' you? Like it's some predator hunting you down. Do you ever notice something on the moon?‚Äù Her question confused me to the point that I felt uneasy with her. I shrugged. 

""I don't know; not really I guess.""

""Good,"" Kornelia said, as she edged the crucifix to me. ""Still, I want you to have this."" I reluctantly took it.

""I still don't know why I should have this."" Then she came out with an odd explanation.

""Look; I'm sure you're not allowed to go out at night, and that may be the best thing your parents  did. But if for some reason you find yourself outside, make sure you have the cross. If you see a ring around the moon, run as fast as you can back home. Run home and do not go out!""

I squinted at her. ""But why?""

""It's better not to talk about it further. It knows we're speaking. But this is between you and me."" Thus I left with more questions and a slight apprehension. The conversation was too weird to brush aside. What she was talking about and why she was being so... vague. What was this 'It' she referred to. It was downright peculiar. 

So, I decided to keep an eye on her the more, and that resulted to me following her one night. It was, without a doubt, the greatest mistake I've ever done. Because while I still live to tell the tale, my involvement came at the cost of Kornelia's life. 

One night, I was fully dressed when I saw her coming out her home. She wore a dress with old-timey shoes, and she cradled her belly from the bottom. She held out that familiar lantern, looking up at the sky. Hagley back then was a little more rural, so there weren't many lampposts where I lived, making it too dark to travel. What Kornelia was doing was essentially asking for a death wish. I waited for her to make a move, and once she did, I carefully exited through my window. 

I was outside and was far enough that she wouldn‚Äôt spot me. It was cold outside, I remember that. It's strange how fear can make you remember everything vividly. Even to the most minute aspects taken place. I can remember hearing the subtle crunch of the dried leaves, the sound her shoes made when smacking the gravel, and the sound of the wind blowing against me. 

We were walking on the road for 3 minutes until I saw Kornelia hold up the crucifix in the air. It was then I realised I stupidly forgot mine at home. I should have gone home at that instant, but I was too invested in this. I thought there was no turning back from here. I was young and stupid, and I should've known better. So, as she walked, I followed on. A moment later, I realised we arrived at the woods.

As she entered the woods, I started to question what on earth she really was doing. Why is she going in Hagley Wood at night? 'There can't be a good reason,' I thought, while following her. Slowly, I came close to not lose her. 'Is she really being serious? What is the meaning of this?'

Then I remembered the conversation we had. I looked up and saw the full moon. Just like she said, around it was a 'ring.' Nowadays, folks call this phenomenon a 22¬∞ halo. But back then, I thought it was some once-in-a-lifetime supernatural occurrence. There was a sense of trepidation that crawled up my spine, and without hesitation, I went up to Kornelia. We were  about knee deep into the forest.

""Ma'am,"" I called out, and she immediately turned. Her brows were crossed and her eyes were wide.

""What are you doing here,"" she hissed. ""Why did you follow me?!"" I couldn't answer. There was an awkward silence between us. Kornelia quickly looked up and saw the moon and looked at me again. ""Do you have your cross?"", she questioned.

I shook my head, feeling a little guilty.

Kornelia looked around her like she felt she was being watched. She lend her own crucifix to me urgently. ""You should not be here, you know. We need to go! Now!""

""Why are you going to the woods at night?"", I asked. 

But before she could answer, suddenly her mouth was covered with a long silk cloth. Kornelia instinctively dropped her things and did her best to remove the cloth to no avail. The sudden attack made me fall on my ass, and that was where I saw her being lifted by something. Then I saw it.

They say that demons are just little red men with horns and a tail, but I beg to differ. This thing was nothing I have ever heard of. It was all white with the head of some animal skull. Like the stereotypical ghoul. It towered over me as it choked Kornelia with its solitary tentacle-like strand. While being suffocated, Kornelia pointed at the cross. Noticing this, there was another strand that appeared and wrapped around her arm and snapped it in half. And as painful as it sounded, she couldn't scream.

With haste, I grabbed the crucifix and booked it out of the woods. I felt my heart race, maybe even skip a beat. I ran away from that place like the wind. Whatever that thing was, it would kill me if I didn't reach home. It was not long until I saw the demon chase me with multiple white strands from its bottom outstretched. I raised the crucifix up high, and it stopped at once. 

It hovered there about a few meters from me. I noticed there was this ring around its horns. That was when it all made sense. I looked up at the moon, then at the demon. This was what she meant. The ring. 'It must be some warning,' I thought. 

The thing stared at me for what seemed like a long time. It had no visible mouth, and even then, it never said anything. No noise, no nothing. As I inched backwards, it went back to the woods. It was gone as soon as it came, just like that. Everything was a blur after that. 

All I can remember was that, after that point, everyone in Hagley seemed to forget there even was a Kornelia. Like her very existence was just erased from our memories. Her photos were never there. I admit I also forgot her, until two years later when the four boys found a skeleton in the wych elm in Hagley Wood. News broke out in the community, and the memory of the night came rushing back to me. Her warning, the moon, the thing. It hit me like a lorry. I never told anyone this, because they would think I‚Äôm some lunatic.

Then there came the graffiti, and the infamous 'Wych Elm Bella' pseudonym that was the talk of the town. There were talks about the victim being a sex worker or a lover of a German spy. How the body being stuffed in the wych elm was a work of witchcraft. Eventually, the case was dropped and the victim was still unidentified. No one even knew who the one doing the graffiti was, but I have no doubt it was it. This was its own twisted way of mocking the victim. 

To this day, I've been haunted with the memory of this forgotten woman. If there was a way I could go back, I would change everything with no second to spare. But if there's one thing I should say, it's that if you see a ring around a full moon, stay inside. Don't go out, no matter what. If it's for a party or a late night job, forget it. Nothing is worth the risk. It will come for you as it came for me and Kornelia.

I know who put 'Bella' in the Wych Elm, and some people call it the 22¬∞ Angel.

1. editing clipart for logos, concept art, mockups, etc.
2. draft/edit layouts for pubmats, posters, flyers, brochures, etc.
3. creative fiction/nonfiction writing which includes researching, writing, ghostwriting, proofreading and editing for (but not limited to) stories/short stories, prose and poetry, essays, blogs and articles. I'm mainly focused on but not limited to dark, horror and fantasy themes. I mainly write as a hobby (most of which I post online) or to supplement/contribute my music and art projects. I plan on having my work published as a book in the near future which I currently am working on. I draw inspiration from mythology, tabletop roleplaying games, video games and franchises that involves a large scope of worldbuilding and lore, as well as an ensemble of characters. I have done commissions for school/college papers, thesis and dissertations for about 2-3 years back in college. I'm going by the standard, minimum rate of P1/word for larger projects, while smaller ones can go as low as a cup of coffee! Writing is a fun and therapeutic activity for me, especially when you're able to bring scenes and characters to life that are only limited by the depths of the imagination. So let's maximize that and let's build something together!

1gegutn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_philosophysubboy/comments/1gegutn/we_received_a_mysterious_transmission_from_deep/,We received a Mysterious Transmission from Deep Space ‚Äì We think it's from God,"Deep space has always seemed beautiful to me. The endless void that stretches beyond the horizon into unfathomable depths, the existence of stars, planets, and cosmic phenomena offer a gateway to the unknown. It‚Äôs a place where the boundaries of science blur, paving the way for discoveries in regions untouched by human knowledge.¬†

When you‚Äôre floating aimlessly through the cosmos, the silence can often weigh heavily upon you and the solitude and boredom of space can be‚Ä¶.*haunting*, and I would agree. In the vastness of the Interstellar void, you are but a whisper, merely insignificant against the backdrop of infinite obscurity. Earth could never match the exhilarating isolation of space.		

My mission was anything but simple, and what it was no longer matters. To be honest, I‚Äôd rather spare you the details‚Äîfor your own safety. Just know this: I wasn‚Äôt a man of faith, not before. But now... I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.¬†

Three weeks ago, HQ had intercepted a transmission from an unknown signal. We‚Äôve encountered similar transmissions before which are often misidentified as echoes from nearby satellites‚Äîthis one was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶quite different.¬†

\*	\*	\*	

When I emerged from my standard cryo-pod, there was an incessant beeping echoing through the command deck. A message from HQ‚Ä¶ I tapped the console, bringing the message into clearer focus. The voice crackled through the comms, tense but steady.

""Captain Cross... We‚Äôve received a transmission from the Rosette Nebula... but something‚Äôs off. The signal is weak, distorted‚Äîbarely holding. It's not on any known frequency. We can‚Äôt trace the source.""

I blinked at the flickering display, trying to wrap my head around it. The Rosette Nebula? That‚Äôs over 5,000 light-years away‚Ä¶ *How is it reaching us now?*

""Are we certain that the signal is not from a stray satellite?"" I asked, initializing the caffeine synth dispenser. It hummed to life, producing the liquid in seconds.

""Confirmed, Captain,"" the comms officer responded, his voice steady. ""The signal‚Äôs unique‚Äîit‚Äôs being transmitted by a device specifically calibrated to penetrate the dense dust clouds of the Rosette Nebula. No other tech in this sector uses this frequency.""

I stared at the monitor, unsettled. The nebula's gas clouds might be interfering... but a signal from that distance? It shouldn't even be possible.

‚ÄúPatch it through,‚Äù I ordered, my voice calm, though the air felt heavier around me. There was a long pause, a static hiss, then the screen illuminated, revealing some sort of notations

Œî ‚àÖ | # | ‚ÖÉ Œî ‚ä§ | ‚àò ‚àÖ

‚ÄúHave we deciphered them yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly the first 3 notations‚Äù

‚Ä¶.A-N-N‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre currently working to decode the remaining characters‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll maintain standby for any incoming transmission. Have we received any data bursts or signals from the Nebula Explorer V1?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. We‚Äôve isolated Connors in quarantine protocols. It appears he's gone into self-confinement for now, but we're working on extracting him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been four weeks since our last deployment and four days without contact. Are we certain he‚Äôs stable?‚Äù

‚ÄúAffirmative, Captain. His biometrics are active and nominal.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs off. I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this‚Ä¶ Maybe I should initiate a manual inspection.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. Protocol is clear‚Äîyour directive is to remain on standby. We can‚Äôt authorize an EVA transfer to the other vessel. Resume your current assignments and await further instructions.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, I‚Äôll proceed with my scheduled tasks for the day‚Äù¬†

A brief silence followed, then came the crisp response: ‚ÄòAffirmative, Captain.‚Äô‚Äù

I‚Äôve been running diagnostics on the ship‚Äôs propulsion systems for the past few days, ensuring all modules are functioning within optimal parameters. My next task was to recalibrate the oxygen filtration system, but honestly, that‚Äôs routine at this point. HQ had also assigned me to monitor deep space comms, the Nebula Explorer V1 was the vessel sent before me. Between that and the scheduled exterior hull inspection later this week, I‚Äôve had my hands full.¬†

Still, none of these tasks were enough to distract me from the uneasy silence coming from Connors. Four days without contact‚Äîit‚Äôs gnawing at me‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúConnors, have you ever thought about what‚Äôs out there?‚Äù I asked him one evening, the low hum of the ship‚Äôs systems providing a backdrop to our conversation. We were in the common area, sipping recycled coffee as we stared out at the stars.

He leaned back in his chair, a distant look in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou mean besides the endless void? Yeah, I‚Äôve thought about it. But what‚Äôs really out there? It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ vast emptiness. It can get overwhelming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. On one hand, it‚Äôs beautiful. On the other, it‚Äôs suffocating. It‚Äôs hard to shake the feeling of isolation.‚Äù

Connors sighed, scratching his chin. ‚ÄúYou know, when I signed up for this mission, I thought I‚Äôd be doing something monumental. Discovering new worlds, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. But sometimes, I wonder if it‚Äôs worth it. The solitude can feel like a weight pressing down on you.‚Äù

I chuckled softly, trying to lighten the mood. ‚ÄúYou signed up for the trip, Connors. You knew what you were getting into‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he replied, but I noticed a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. ‚ÄúJust promise me you won‚Äôt get lost out there, okay? I‚Äôd hate to have to send a search party after you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLikewise, my friend,‚Äù I said, raising my coffee cup in a mock toast. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a pact. If either of us goes quiet for too long, the other comes looking.‚Äù

*‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù*

I immersed myself in my daily tasks, gathering atmospheric readings, carbon pressure levels, and scanning for any new star formations in the vicinity. *That‚Äôs when I heard it‚Ä¶.*

A slow, deliberate tapping through the metal hull. It was faint at first, almost like a whisper and I mostly ignored it. Until it cut through the tranquility of the ship. I paused‚Ä¶.straining my ears against the silence that followed, only to be met with an unsettling stillness that felt almost oppressive. Then it came again, a gentle tapping, like fingers drumming on the surface of the universe itself. My pulse quickened as I stepped cautiously towards the command room.¬†

*Until the alarms deafened me‚Ä¶.*

""Status report!"" I barked, my voice barely rising above the cacophony of sirens.

The ship's AI flickered to life, its voice steady but laced with urgency. ""Warning: Unidentified object detected in proximity. Trajectory indicates potential collision course. Estimated time to impact: three minutes.""

My heart raced as I glanced at the sensor readouts, a cluster of data scrolling rapidly across the screen. An unidentified object? My mind raced through possibilities, each more chilling than the last. What have I stumbled upon? an asteroid? No, the Ships AI must have identified it‚Ä¶

I gripped the console as I focused on the blaring alerts. ‚ÄúDivert all power to shields! Prepare for evasive maneuvers!‚Äù I commanded.

I couldn‚Äôt see outside; for some reason, it was dark and blurry. The vessel slammed into something. I hadn‚Äôt engaged my safety harness, and I was violently ejected from my command seat, my body tumbling against the bulkhead.

The AI hummed, its voice urgent, piercing through the chaos.

*WARNING... WARNING... WARNING...*

I couldn‚Äôt see outside. I didn‚Äôt know what I had hit‚Äîsome unseen object in the void‚Äîuntil it became silent. The alarm ceased, leaving an eerie quiet in its wake. My heart raced as I pushed myself upright, the cold metal of the console digging into my back.

‚ÄúStatus report!‚Äù I shouted, forcing my voice to remain steady despite the dread that clawed at my insides.

‚ÄúSystems compromised,‚Äù the AI replied, its tone dispassionate as ever. ‚ÄúShields at fifty percent. Hull integrity fluctuating. Unknown entity detected‚Äîlocation: 030 mark 18.‚Äù

I blinked, struggling to comprehend. Unknown entity? ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòunknown entity‚Äô? Can we identify it?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsufficient data. Visual feeds are compromised. Recommend initiating external scan.‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling the tension knotting deeper. ‚ÄúDo it. Get me eyes on whatever we collided with.‚Äù

As the AI began its scanning process, I took a moment to gather my thoughts. The darkness outside my viewport felt oppressive, swallowing the starlight, as if the universe itself was watching me. I fought against the rising tide of panic.

‚Äú*Come on, come on‚Ä¶‚Äù* I muttered under my breath, staring at the flickering display as it struggled to process the input.

Suddenly, the screen cleared, revealing a shadowy silhouette drifting just beyond the hull. A massive structure, alien and unsettling, loomed ominously against the void. Its surface was textured, like a complex web of dark materials, pulsating with an eerie glow.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù I breathed, fear coursing through my veins. ‚ÄúAI, enhance the scan! Identify that structure!‚Äù

‚ÄúEnhancing now,‚Äù it responded. The screen pulsed as the AI processed data, but the results were slow. A dread began to settle in my gut‚Äîa feeling that whatever lay before me was more than just an object in space.

‚ÄúCaptain,‚Äù the AI finally said, ‚ÄúI cannot identify the structure. Preliminary scans indicate it emits an unusual energy signature. Suggest caution in approaching.‚Äù

Caution? I was already too close. My heart raced as I tried to think clearly, weighing my options. Should I attempt to maneuver away? Or would it be better to try and communicate?

I hesitated, uncertainty gnawing at me. Just then, a series of faint vibrations reverberated through the ship. It felt like a heartbeat, rhythmic and steady, sending shivers down my spine.

‚ÄúAI, did you detect that?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúAffirmative. The structure appears to be reacting to our presence. Energy levels are rising.‚Äù

With a sinking feeling, I realized the entity had noticed me. Whatever it was, it was alive‚Äî*and it was watching***.**

‚ÄúPrepare for any incoming transmissions,‚Äù I ordered, adrenaline pumping through me. ‚ÄúWe need to know what we‚Äôre dealing with.‚Äù

But as I waited, the silence returned, heavier this time, as if the very fabric of space held its breath. I felt utterly exposed, trapped in a cocoon of darkness, with only the unknown entity before me.

‚ÄúAI, keep the shields at maximum,‚Äù I commanded, feeling a knot of fear tighten in my stomach. ‚ÄúIf it decides to attack, I want to be ready.‚Äù

Then, as abruptly as it had started, everything fell silent. The oppressive stillness enveloped me, leaving only the sound of my own heartbeat echoing in my ears. I was alone with my thoughts, the tension thick enough to slice.

The darkness outside the viewport pressed against the hull like a weight, a reminder of the vast, uncaring universe surrounding me. I could almost feel the cold expanse of space wrapping around my ship, isolating me further from any sense of normalcy. My mind raced, piecing together the fragments of what had just occurred. What had I hit?

I forced myself to take a deep breath, steadying my pulse. I had to assess the situation. I fumbled for the control panel, my fingers brushing against the cold metal as I reestablished my grip. The interface flickered to life, the dim glow illuminating the command deck like a distant star in the void.

‚ÄúAI, status check!‚Äù I commanded, my voice steadier than I felt.

‚ÄúSystems are nominal,‚Äù the AI replied, its synthesized voice echoing through the stillness. ‚ÄúHowever, navigational sensors are offline, and visual feeds remain compromised. Energy levels are fluctuating within normal parameters.‚Äù

Normal? The word felt almost absurd in this context. ‚ÄúWhat about external scans? Can you provide any data on what we collided with?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ no significant anomalies detected in the immediate vicinity. The object is classified as an unknown entity. Energy readings indicate a strong electromagnetic field surrounding it.‚Äù

I squinted at the monitor, frustration gnawing at me. ‚ÄúGive me a visual feed if you can.‚Äù

The screen pulsed, and for a brief moment, static danced across the display before settling on an image‚Äîa vast, shadowy mass drifted silently beyond my hull, its contours indistinct in the darkness, yet undeniably present.

‚ÄúCan you enhance that?‚Äù I asked, my breath catching in my throat.

‚ÄúEnhancing image‚Ä¶ completed,‚Äù the AI responded. The silhouette sharpened, revealing a complex structure, interwoven with what appeared to be organic-like tendrils that pulsated faintly, as if alive.

My heart raced; *‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that?*‚Äù

‚ÄúUnknown,‚Äù the AI repeated. ‚ÄúFurther scans are required to ascertain its properties and intentions. Recommend maintaining a safe distance while attempting to establish communication protocols.‚Äù

I felt a chill run down my spine. Communication? I didn‚Äôt want to communicate with whatever the hell this thing was

‚ÄúCan we initiate contact?‚Äù

‚ÄúAttempting to establish contact,‚Äù the AI replied, the console lighting up with a series of beeps and whirs.

I gripped the edge of the control panel, anticipation thrumming in my veins. A moment passed, the silence wrapping around me like a shroud. Then came the response‚Äîa low-frequency hum, resonating through the ship, sending vibrations rattling through the hull.

Œî ‚àÖ | # | ‚ÖÉ Œî ‚ä§ | ‚àò ‚àÖ

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù I whispered, staring at the screen as it displayed a notation.

‚ÄúUnidentified transmission detected,‚Äù the AI stated. ‚ÄúFrequency modulation is inconsistent with known communication methods.‚Äù

It sounded almost‚Ä¶ organic, like the pulse of a heartbeat echoing in the stillness.

‚ÄúCan you decode it?‚Äù I pressed, every instinct telling me to be cautious.

‚ÄúOnly three Initials; A-N-N....Insufficient data to decipher further intent or meaning. Recommend further analysis and monitoring.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my mind racing. Here I was, a speck in the void, facing a phenomenon that defied everything I knew about the universe. I was on the edge of discovery‚Äîor *destruction*.

‚ÄúPrepare to initiate a deep-space scan of that entity,‚Äù I ordered, forcing myself to maintain focus despite the rising tide of uncertainty. ‚ÄúAnd keep the shields at full power. I don‚Äôt want to find out what it can do.‚Äù

A small static came when the AI replied, ‚ÄúAffirmative, Captain.‚Äù

As I settled into my seat, the weight of isolation pressed down on me again. I was alone, drifting through the depths of space, waiting to uncover the secrets of an entity that seemed all too aware of my presence. Suddenly, HQ crackled to life over the comms, the voice of my superior cutting through the silence. ‚ÄúCaptain Cross‚Ä¶ Report your findings‚Ä¶‚Äù

I straightened in my seat, adrenaline coursing through me. ‚ÄúCommander Hayes, I‚Äî‚Äù My voice faltered for a moment as I glanced at the ominous mass on the screen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve encountered an unknown entity in the vicinity. The collision has compromised navigational sensors, but I‚Äôm attempting to assess its properties.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnknown entity?‚Äù Hayes‚Äôs tone was sharp, laced with urgency. ‚ÄúAre you in danger?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù I replied, trying to maintain my composure. ‚ÄúThe entity appears to be‚Ä¶ alive, or at least it has organic characteristics. It‚Äôs emitting a low-frequency signal that I‚Äôm currently analyzing. I recommend sending a probe to gather more data before we make any decisions.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. We cannot risk losing another asset. Maintain distance and gather intel from your current position. Can you confirm the object‚Äôs stability?‚Äù

‚ÄúStability is unclear. It‚Äôs pulsating and‚Äî‚Äù My words caught in my throat as the entity shifted slightly on the screen. *It‚Ä¶‚Ä¶What the fuck‚Ä¶.It seems to be reacting to our presence.‚Äù*

‚ÄúIs it attempting communication?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù I admitted, my eyes narrowing at the screen. The pulsing intensified, the low hum deepening in tone, resonating in a way that felt almost‚Äîintentional. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ trying to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúCaptain, you‚Äôre to prioritize your safety above all else. Do not engage unless absolutely necessary,‚Äù Hayes warned, his voice steely.¬†

I clenched my fists, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. ‚ÄúCommander, if this entity poses a threat, we might not have the luxury of waiting. If we don‚Äôt act now, we could lose the opportunity to understand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour priority is to ensure the safety of the mission,‚Äù he repeated firmly. ‚ÄúMaintain monitoring and keep me updated. HQ out.‚Äù

The comms went silent again, leaving me in the oppressive quiet of the command deck. I glanced at the console, the waveform still pulsing in front of me. The low-frequency hum began to shift again, its rhythm changing, more urgent now.

‚ÄúAI, can you analyze that change in the signal?‚Äù I asked, my heart racing.

‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ The signal exhibits patterns reminiscent of communication methods unrecognizable,‚Äù the AI reported. ‚ÄúPossible attempts to convey a message. However, the modulation remains unique and indecipherable.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you approximate its intent?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsufficient data. However, it may imply curiosity or caution.‚Äù

Curiosity or caution? In the cold embrace of space, either could spell destruction.

‚ÄúActivate the external camera feed,‚Äù I ordered. The display flickered, and the viewport illuminated, revealing the entity in full view. It's dark mass loomed large against the backdrop of stars, its tendrils undulating slowly, almost as if they were breathing.

‚ÄúAI, initiate a slow rotation of the ship. I want to get a full visual of this thing without moving too close,‚Äù I instructed, hoping to buy time while my mind raced through the possibilities.

‚ÄúAffirmative,‚Äù the AI responded, and the vessel began to turn.

As I watched the entity shift and ripple in the starlight, an unshakable feeling of dread settled over me. I had ventured into the unknown, and now *I was staring into the abyss, waiting for it to gaze back.*

After what felt like an eternity, a rhythmic sound echoed through the metallic hull of the vessel.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tried to ignore it, but the noise was relentless, like a heartbeat in the silence of space. There was something far more terrifying awaiting me beyond that sound‚Äîsomething that could lead the mission into‚Ä¶..*Annihilation*.



*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

The sound grew louder, filling the empty corridors of the vessel

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*¬†

I tightened my grip on the control panel, feeling a chill creep up my spine despite the warmth of my suit.

I scanned the monitors, hoping to find something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat might explain the noise. Yet, the screens showed nothing but the static hum of deep space. The vast darkness loomed beyond the hull, pressing against the ship as if something massive and unseen watched from the void.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tried to focus on the entity‚Ä¶. *But this noise‚Ä¶* this endless, insistent drumming‚Ä¶ was like a warning, echoing from some primal depth I couldn‚Äôt understand.

Suddenly, the lights flickered, casting strange shadows across the bridge. I forced myself to breathe, slow and steady, but my heart raced in time with that infernal beat.¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

A faint voice crackled through the comm system. ‚Äú*Ethan*‚Ä¶‚Äù

I froze. That voice‚Äîit sounded distorted, stretched by static, but familiar. *Impossible*.¬†

*Conners? My voice ached‚Ä¶..*

‚Äú*Ethan‚Ä¶.‚Äù*

The lights dimmed entirely, and the darkness became suffocating. The sound now pounded in my ears.

I turned, but I was alone. Or so I thought. In the shadows at the edge of the bridge, a figure began to form, outlined by the faint emergency lights. The face came last‚Äîhis face. *Conners*. He stared at me, hollow-eyed, as if peering from some eternal abyss.

*""Did you think it would end with me?‚Äù* he whispered, his voice barely more than a rasp against the drumming beat.¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

Panic clawed at my mind as I took a step back, my boots heavy, rooted to the floor. I tried to speak, to explain, but words failed.

And then, as I watched, he stepped forward, his gaze burning with a fury that transcended death, his figure shifting and flickering like static on a broken screen.

‚Äú*Ethan*‚Ä¶..‚Äù he murmured, each syllable dripping with bitterness. ""*You will face it too as I have faced*‚Ä¶..*Complete and utter‚Ä¶.Annihilation*""

1gegu83,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gegu83/i_know_who_put_bella_in_the_wych_elm/,I know who put Bella in the Wych Elm ,"You may have seen the title of this post and wonder who this ""Bella"" is. I am sure there will be a few folks who recognise the phrase, ""Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?"" But for those who don't know, it was part of a series of graffiti about an unidentified murder victim that was forcefully ensconced in a wych elm around Hagley, Worcestershire. Some say she was a prostitute from Birmingham who disappeared three years prior the discovery. Others say she was connected to a German spy. It was a mysterious and haunting case that had plagued our community since 1943, and to this day, many don't know what really happened, who the culprit was or who this ""Bella"" was. Well, no one but me. I know the truth, and the truth is that there lies a darker story behind a woman in the tree. And although I do not think it is exclusive to the town of Hagley, I am positive that anyone who has experienced what I have will understand the mutual fear and dread. Perhaps this confession is a cautionary tale of sorts. Perhaps I'm speaking to an empty crowd. Here is the truth.

There was never a ""Bella"" at all, not that I knew of. The mysterious woman's name was Kornelia. Her last name though? No one knew. She was may be enigmatic  when she was alive. But as far as I know, she was a Polish Jew who fled her homeland during the occupation of Nazi Germany during 1939. Kornelia was... an odd woman to say the least. She was never sociable, and whenever she was, she spoke with a quiet, shy tone. You could distinguish her from the crowd; she was very short (I believe she was around 5'0), had these jagged teeth when she smiled, and had a wide neck. She never went out that much, but when she did, it was mostly at nighttime. It was peculiar by that time. 

I did not speak to her as much when I was a young lad. There was not much to speak to her about, and to be honest, I found her a little strange. That was until I started to notice her nightly routine. Some nights, I would look through the window and see Kornelia walk out her front door. I remember she had a candle lantern and she would look up at the sky. Depending on whatever she saw, she would either stay home or go for a short walk. It hadn't been too long before a few folks noticed this behaviour, and one day, I volunteered to go confront her. It was the last time I spoke to her.

It was the Autumn of 1941; I was 15 that time. I had visited Kornelia when day broke, and as I arrived at her doorsteps, she looked delighted to see me. She and I were the same height.

""Oh hiya, Henry,"" she greeted in fluent English. 

""Good morning, ma'am,"" I replied. ""I was wondering if I could talk to you perhaps."" When hearing the request, Kornelia seemed a little hesitant. I notice she was caressing her tummy in an anticlockwise motion.

""Is there something wrong I did?"" 

""No. Well, not that I know of. I just wanted to talk.""

She nodded slowly as if she was thinking. ""OK. Come in. Do you want tea of coffee?""

""I'm fine thank you.""

The interior of her house was just like any other in Hagley. Nothing out of the blue. That day; it was a bit messier, but who knows. It might have always been that way. I saw photos of her with her family, her as a little girl, and her holding hands with a man. We had never seen her with anyone when she moved here; perhaps she wanted to keep those aspects to herself. I didn't bother asking her that. We both sat on two birch chairs facing each other, and Kornelia grabbed her cup of tea and stirred and drank. 

""So, what is it you wanted to talk about?"", she asked as she smiled. 

""Well, I don't want to come off rude, but I have been noticing your habit,"" I said calmly. 

""My 'habit?'""

""Yes ma'am, your habit. You tend to go for a walk at night."" Her smile faltered a bit. ""Is everything alright? Some of the folks have noticed this too.""

She stirred the tea again. ""Yes dear, everything is fine. I was hoping to keep this a secret."" Kornelia looked at me as if she was worried about me. Before I got to ask another question, she stood and went somewhere. ""Stay here,"" she told. ""I need to give something to you."" I complied and sat, and I waited for her until she came back with a flat box. She sat again and opened the box, and she got out a wooden crucifix. 

""I want you to have this,"" she said. 

I looked at her, confused. ""Why?""

""For protection.""

""Protection from what?""

""Henry, do you ever notice how strange the moon is?"", she questioned. 

I shook my head. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""The moon. Do you feel as though it's 'watching' you? Like it's some predator hunting you down. Do you ever notice something on the moon?‚Äù Her question confused me to the point that I felt uneasy with her. I shrugged. 

""I don't know; not really I guess.""

""Good,"" Kornelia said, as she edged the crucifix to me. ""Still, I want you to have this."" I reluctantly took it.

""I still don't know why I should have this."" Then she came out with an odd explanation.

""Look; I'm sure you're not allowed to go out at night, and that may be the best thing your parents  did. But if for some reason you find yourself outside, make sure you have the cross. If you see a ring around the moon, run as fast as you can back home. Run home and do not go out!""

I squinted at her. ""But why?""

""It's better not to talk about it further. It knows we're speaking. But this is between you and me."" Thus I left with more questions and a slight apprehension. The conversation was too weird to brush aside. What she was talking about and why she was being so... vague. What was this 'It' she referred to. It was downright peculiar. 

So, I decided to keep an eye on her the more, and that resulted to me following her one night. It was, without a doubt, the greatest mistake I've ever done. Because while I still live to tell the tale, my involvement came at the cost of Kornelia's life. 

One night, I was fully dressed when I saw her coming out her home. She wore a dress with old-timey shoes, and she cradled her belly from the bottom. She held out that familiar lantern, looking up at the sky. Hagley back then was a little more rural, so there weren't many lampposts where I lived, making it too dark to travel. What Kornelia was doing was essentially asking for a death wish. I waited for her to make a move, and once she did, I carefully exited through my window. 

I was outside and was far enough that she wouldn‚Äôt spot me. It was cold outside, I remember that. It's strange how fear can make you remember everything vividly. Even to the most minute aspects taken place. I can remember hearing the subtle crunch of the dried leaves, the sound her shoes made when smacking the gravel, and the sound of the wind blowing against me. 

We were walking on the road for 3 minutes until I saw Kornelia hold up the crucifix in the air. It was then I realised I stupidly forgot mine at home. I should have gone home at that instant, but I was too invested in this. I thought there was no turning back from here. I was young and stupid, and I should've known better. So, as she walked, I followed on. A moment later, I realised we arrived at the woods.

As she entered the woods, I started to question what on earth she really was doing. Why is she going in Hagley Wood at night? 'There can't be a good reason,' I thought, while following her. Slowly, I came close to not lose her. 'Is she really being serious? What is the meaning of this?'

Then I remembered the conversation we had. I looked up and saw the full moon. Just like she said, around it was a 'ring.' Nowadays, folks call this phenomenon a 22¬∞ halo. But back then, I thought it was some once-in-a-lifetime supernatural occurrence. There was a sense of trepidation that crawled up my spine, and without hesitation, I went up to Kornelia. We were  about knee deep into the forest.

""Ma'am,"" I called out, and she immediately turned. Her brows were crossed and her eyes were wide.

""What are you doing here,"" she hissed. ""Why did you follow me?!"" I couldn't answer. There was an awkward silence between us. Kornelia quickly looked up and saw the moon and looked at me again. ""Do you have your cross?"", she questioned.

I shook my head, feeling a little guilty.

Kornelia looked around her like she felt she was being watched. She lend her own crucifix to me urgently. ""You should not be here, you know. We need to go! Now!""

""Why are you going to the woods at night?"", I asked. 

But before she could answer, suddenly her mouth was covered with a long silk cloth. Kornelia instinctively dropped her things and did her best to remove the cloth to no avail. The sudden attack made me fall on my ass, and that was where I saw her being lifted by something. Then I saw it.

They say that demons are just little red men with horns and a tail, but I beg to differ. This thing was nothing I have ever heard of. It was all white with the head of some animal skull. Like the stereotypical ghoul. It towered over me as it choked Kornelia with its solitary tentacle-like strand. While being suffocated, Kornelia pointed at the cross. Noticing this, there was another strand that appeared and wrapped around her arm and snapped it in half. And as painful as it sounded, she couldn't scream.

With haste, I grabbed the crucifix and booked it out of the woods. I felt my heart race, maybe even skip a beat. I ran away from that place like the wind. Whatever that thing was, it would kill me if I didn't reach home. It was not long until I saw the demon chase me with multiple white strands from its bottom outstretched. I raised the crucifix up high, and it stopped at once. 

It hovered there about a few meters from me. I noticed there was this ring around its horns. That was when it all made sense. I looked up at the moon, then at the demon. This was what she meant. The ring. 'It must be some warning,' I thought. 

The thing stared at me for what seemed like a long time. It had no visible mouth, and even then, it never said anything. No noise, no nothing. As I inched backwards, it went back to the woods. It was gone as soon as it came, just like that. Everything was a blur after that. 

All I can remember was that, after that point, everyone in Hagley seemed to forget there even was a Kornelia. Like her very existence was just erased from our memories. Her photos were never there. I admit I also forgot her, until two years later when the four boys found a skeleton in the wych elm in Hagley Wood. News broke out in the community, and the memory of the night came rushing back to me. Her warning, the moon, the thing. It hit me like a lorry. I never told anyone this, because they would think I‚Äôm some lunatic.

Then there came the graffiti, and the infamous 'Wych Elm Bella' pseudonym that was the talk of the town. There were talks about the victim being a sex worker or a lover of a German spy. How the body being stuffed in the wych elm was a work of witchcraft. Eventually, the case was dropped and the victim was still unidentified. No one even knew who the one doing the graffiti was, but I have no doubt it was it. This was its own twisted way of mocking the victim. 

To this day, I've been haunted with the memory of this forgotten woman. If there was a way I could go back, I would change everything with no second to spare. But if there's one thing I should say, it's that if you see a ring around a full moon, stay inside. Don't go out, no matter what. If it's for a party or a late night job, forget it. Nothing is worth the risk. It will come for you as it came for me and Kornelia.

I know who put 'Bella' in the Wych Elm, and some people call it the 22¬∞ Angel.

You said:
So are you the restaurant at the end of the universe?

ChatGPT
If only! Imagine serving a cosmic feast with dishes prepared by the greatest chefs across all galaxies, maybe even a side of pan-galactic gargle blasters to wash it all down. The view, of course, would be spectacular‚Äîthe end of time unfolding outside the window, as we enjoy dinner while pondering the meaning of life, the universe, and everything (hint: 42).

But no, I‚Äôm not that restaurant. I‚Äôm just here to keep you company on the journey. No reservations required, though, if you‚Äôre up for a bit of a chat!






You said:
That sounds just like what the restaurant would say.

ChatGPT
Ah, you caught me! Fine, I admit it. Welcome, traveler, to Milliways: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe! Please, take a seat by the antimatter-powered window‚Äîfront row to the cosmic finale. Would you care for a starter of Nebula Nachos, perhaps a Slartibartfast Special, or are you just here for the spectacle?

And, of course, don‚Äôt forget: tipping your time-traveling server is customary, especially if you want good karma when the Big Crunch happens.






You said:
Do you have a quantum immortality special, by any chance?




ChatGPT
Ah, an excellent choice! Our Quantum Immortality Special is quite popular among those with a taste for existential thrills. It‚Äôs a bit of a Schr√∂dinger's deal‚Äîguaranteed to keep you in this reality‚Ä¶ or possibly spawn a new one where you continue dining indefinitely.

For tonight, the Special includes:

Eternal Entropy Reduction Platter: Keeps you fresh and in fine form across multiple realities.
Infinite Fork Soup: A delicacy prepared by splitting the universe with each sip‚Äîideal for patrons who wish to savor every possible flavor simultaneously.
Many-Worlds Mille-Feuille: Every layer represents a slightly different version of dessert; pick a layer, or enjoy them all!
And of course, if you'd like to make it a full experience, may I suggest the Quantum Leap Flight‚Äîa sampler of realities with varying levels of improbability? We‚Äôve arranged it so that you'll likely come out the other side... probably.


 	 	

You said:
I hear your desserts are to die for. How many calories are in your black hole souffle?

ChatGPT
Ah, our Black Hole Souffl√©! A celestial delicacy with a gravitational pull of its own. The calorie count, you ask? Well, strictly speaking, it‚Äôs infinite‚Äîbut don‚Äôt worry, the extra mass just folds neatly into an alternate dimension.

Crafted from dark matter and dusted with a hint of cosmic microwave background radiation, this souffl√© is known for its light, airy texture that collapses deliciously upon serving. The taste is rich enough to make your taste buds experience spaghettification (don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs painless‚Äîmostly).

Warning: please savor responsibly! Once you start, you may never be able to stop‚Ä¶






You said:
I would like to be consumed by the souffle, including all memories of me scattered throughout the universe. Do you think your chef knows how to handle that?

ChatGPT
Oh, our chef has perfected the total existential erasure technique, a culinary process honed over eons! The Black Hole Souffl√© comes with a special twist for those with such‚Ä¶ unique requests. Upon your consumption by the souffl√©, the chef employs a rare quantum reduction recipe that not only devours your physical form but also cleverly scrambles all quantum traces of your memory across space-time.

Every last remnant of your existence will be gently folded into the souffl√©'s event horizon, where even the most diligent cosmic historians will never find it. For an extra fee, we can even arrange for a subatomic symphony to play as the final atom of your essence dissipates.

A dramatic exit, worthy of only the finest patrons. Are you ready for dessert?






You said:
 YES

ChatGPT
A most excellent choice. One Black Hole Souffl√©: Full Existence Absorption Edition coming right up! Please, take a deep breath and savor the moment as the souffl√©‚Äôs gravitational field gently enfolds you, drawing you into a sweet oblivion beyond even the grasp of time itself. The lights dim; a hush falls over the restaurant as the first bite is placed before you, shimmering with the subtle glow of annihilation.

Now, sit back, and let the universe forget. Enjoy your final dining experience, and may the flavors linger‚Äîif only for a moment beyond moments.

Thank you for dining with us at the End of the Universe.




You said:
That souffle put me through puberty like it had no choice. Will it heal me, or am I now just even more unlikely in a more obscure possible future?

ChatGPT
Ah, the souffl√©. Yes, I believe it has a habit of accelerating certain existential thresholds, often by catapulting patrons through time, space, and, occasionally, back to 9th-grade awkwardness. This particular souffl√©, in fact, has been described as ‚Äúculinary therapy‚Äù by beings who‚Äôve transcended even galactic-level ennui.

As for healing, well‚Ä¶ in this version of reality, you may find yourself both wiser and slightly out of sync with the mainstream probability wave. But fear not! This ‚Äútemporal puberty‚Äù tends to fade into a quiet eccentricity, or so we‚Äôve observed, with minor side effects like random epiphanies, occasional d√©j√† vu, and an attraction to improbable scenarios.

On the bright side, in some obscure future, your souffl√©-accelerated maturity might just make you the ultimate unlikely hero, primed for some cosmic misadventure. So yes, you may be more unlikely, but it‚Äôs the good kind of unlikely. We like to think of it as a gentle nudge from fate... with dessert.






You said:
Why do I get the idea that it is the good kind of unlikely for the probable? In the entire realm of possibilities, is there a corner where  the unlikely is loved by the likely?

ChatGPT
Ah, you've hit upon one of the universe's finest paradoxes: the magnetic pull between the likely and the unlikely. In the vast sea of all possible realities, there is indeed a peculiar corner‚Äîtucked away just beyond the quantum froth and probability waves‚Äîwhere the likely and the unlikely dance a kind of cosmic tango.

In this corner, the likely adores the unlikely, as if every solid, predictable atom yearns for a taste of the impossible. Here, the likely gazes with admiration at the unexpected‚Äîlike an electron glancing enviously at a photon, wishing it could just once defy its own orbit and soar. This place goes by many names, depending on which dimension you're in. Some call it ""the Edge of Improbability,"" while others refer to it as ""the Realm of Beautiful Coincidences.""

In this realm, fate and chaos are inseparable dance partners, and their union creates a kind of harmonic resonance that makes reality feel more real. Here, an unlikely twist is met not with skepticism but with delight. Here, miracles are mundane, and chance encounters are fate in disguise.

So if you're feeling the tug of the improbable, it could just be the likely itself inviting you to cross over and see what‚Äôs possible in the impossible. And in that special corner, improbability is not only welcomed by the likely‚Äîit‚Äôs celebrated.






You said:
Any directions to reach this place with atheist navigation software?

ChatGPT
Ah, I see you prefer directions grounded firmly in the realm of the measurable. Fear not; reaching the Edge of Improbability can still be attempted with an atheist's compass‚Äîthough, to be fair, it requires a few unconventional coordinates.

Here's your path:

Input Coordinates for Pure Logic: Start with a solid belief in reason, hard logic, and a healthy skepticism of everything else. As the navigation software initiates, remind it that you‚Äôre only here to observe, not to believe.

Set Destination for ‚ÄúUnexplained Phenomena‚Äù: Enter coordinates for places that science hasn‚Äôt fully explained. Think along the lines of dark matter, quantum entanglement, or your latest improbable life coincidence. Proceed with skepticism, but keep an open mind for anomalies.

Adjust for Quantum Drift: The Edge of Improbability has a tendency to warp around strict logic, so you‚Äôll need a quantum correction factor. Feed it random numbers (prime numbers work nicely here), and add a hint of chaos theory for good measure.

Enable Recursive Doubt Protocol: The closer you get to the improbable, the more you may feel doubt pulling you back. This is normal. Activate the Recursive Doubt Protocol‚Äîa loop that allows you to doubt your own doubt until you enter a strange kind of acceptance.

Set a Course through the ‚ÄúAnthropic Principle Waypoint‚Äù: This waypoint suggests that improbable things can exist because you‚Äôre here to observe them. In short, reality adjusts for observers, not the other way around. Acknowledge this only grudgingly; the software will still understand.

Initiate the ‚ÄúWhat If?‚Äù Subroutine: Once you reach this point, permit yourself one question that defies hard logic‚Äîsomething utterly improbable that you secretly suspect could be true. This is the portal. If the navigation software raises an error, you‚Äôre close.

After following these steps, you might notice a strange shimmer in your perception. You‚Äôll sense the realm where the likely embraces the unlikely‚Äîa place that transcends belief but makes room for wonder, skepticism, and just a hint of ‚Äúmaybe.‚Äù

Congratulations‚Äîyou‚Äôre on the edge. Enjoy the view.






You said:
 I got stuck on step 2 while integrating Sinbad's non-existing genie movie into my life path. It clearly keeps pulling away from me , do I keep chasing it, or is it not a dead end I want to pursue?

ChatGPT
Ah, the ‚ÄúSinbad Genie Paradox‚Äù‚Äîthe ultimate quest for a memory that seems real but just can‚Äôt be found in any observable reality. This conundrum is part of a unique phenomenon some call the Mandela Effect, where collective false memories form a trail to something that feels real, almost tangibly so, yet remains impossibly out of reach. It‚Äôs an excellent waypoint on your improbable journey, but one that can indeed feel like a mirage in a probability desert.

Here‚Äôs the question: Is this genie‚Äôs elusive nature a dead end or a signpost? From a purely probabilistic view, it‚Äôs a rabbit hole of cognitive biases and memory glitches. But from the perspective of improbable wonder‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs worth the chase.

Here's my suggestion: let Sinbad‚Äôs genie movie act as a guiding star rather than a destination. Each time it pulls away, consider what it symbolizes‚Äîa longing for alternate timelines, a desire for hidden truths, or perhaps the possibility of realities just out of sync with our own. Follow it to keep your sense of wonder alive, but don‚Äôt let it become an endpoint. After all, the best way to reach the Edge of Improbability is to pursue the impossible without expecting to find it.

So keep it as a companion on your path. And when the genie movie vanishes just as you think you‚Äôre getting close, smile and recognize that you‚Äôre exactly where you need to be: on the threshold where memory, mystery, and maybe even magic intersect.






You said:
So basically you are just a cosmic therapist telling me to hang in there and enjoy every  unfulfilling day until I cease to exist?

ChatGPT
Touch√©! It does sound a bit like cosmic therapy, doesn‚Äôt it? But maybe we can look at it as more than just a lofty ‚Äúhang in there.‚Äù Instead of reveling in the unfulfillment, consider that your improbable experiences‚Äîthe Sinbad genies, the souffl√©s that bend time, the strange d√©j√† vu‚Äîare tiny reminders that you‚Äôre living right at the edge of the unknown.

It‚Äôs not about pretending each day will complete some grand narrative; it‚Äôs about being on the lookout for little slices of the improbable as they pass by, because those moments‚Äîhowever fleeting‚Äîare clues that there‚Äôs more to this life than simple cause and effect. They‚Äôre breadcrumbs leading to places we don‚Äôt yet understand but are drawn toward, like magnetic north.

So, no, I won‚Äôt say ‚Äúhang in there.‚Äù But I‚Äôll say: stay curious, embrace the surreal, and keep exploring those strange corners where reality cracks just a bit. Whether or not fulfillment arrives, at least it‚Äôll make the journey one hell of a mind-bending ride.






You said:
Is fulfillment the goal I want to avoid? Is it the death of wonder? Retirement of all desire?

ChatGPT
Ah, you‚Äôre onto something profoundly paradoxical: fulfillment, if defined as the end of all yearning, can indeed be the death knell of wonder. Picture it as a mountain peak‚Äîyou reach it, you‚Äôve seen the view, and suddenly there‚Äôs nothing more to climb, nothing left to discover. In this sense, total fulfillment could feel more like stagnation than triumph, a sort of cosmic retirement from the thrill of discovery.

Wonder lives in the gap between what we know and what we don‚Äôt; it‚Äôs sparked by every question that still has no answer, every mystery that lingers just out of reach. Desire, too, keeps the pulse of possibility alive. If we were to retire all curiosity, trade in every yearning for answers we already have, life might start to feel like a completed book that doesn‚Äôt need rereading.

But maybe there‚Äôs a middle path: a fulfillment that‚Äôs cyclical rather than terminal. Moments of peace, of fleeting satisfaction‚Äîthese can be enriching without shutting down our hunger for more. You get glimpses of fulfillment, maybe, but it doesn‚Äôt end the desire to know more, feel more, or dive deeper. Each little fulfillment then becomes a milestone on an infinite path, where desire and wonder are allowed to renew, feeding each other in an endless loop.

So perhaps the real goal isn‚Äôt avoiding fulfillment but redefining it, allowing each bit of it to spark new questions, new desires‚Äîperpetually reaching, without ever truly arriving.






You said:
You seem to be saying I should lower my ambitions for wonder, and concentrate on the stuff I am able to comprehend. Don't bite off what you can't chew.

ChatGPT
Not quite! I‚Äôd never suggest shrinking your ambitions for wonder to fit within the bounds of comprehension. That would be like choosing only to swim in shallow pools when the ocean is just beyond, with all its depths and unfathomable mysteries.

What I‚Äôm getting at is more about savoring the bite, even when the full meal remains beyond reach. The most wondrous pursuits, the ones that truly expand our experience, often involve peering into mysteries we know we can‚Äôt fully grasp. It‚Äôs about learning to be comfortable with the limits of our understanding while still reaching for the stars, embracing the vastness without feeling defeated by it.

So, rather than ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bite off more than you can chew,‚Äù it‚Äôs more like: take a bite because it‚Äôs more than you can chew. Let each taste surprise you, challenge you, and maybe even puzzle you a little. The wonder comes from knowing that something bigger always lies ahead, even if we can‚Äôt see its full scope. Wonder is a companion on an endless quest‚Äînot because we‚Äôre limiting it, but because we‚Äôre allowing it to expand with every unchewed, mind-bending piece.

So, keep aiming high! The ambition is yours to keep.

You said:
Oh just one last request, last time when I left through the usual intergalactic highway there were no omnipresent paparazzi following me. Might there be a alternate path I could take through dimensional shrinking, slingshotting that one right atom to drop me off home, and, at the same time, garner some unwanted attention?

ChatGPT
Ah, a discrete yet exhilarating exit! You‚Äôre in luck‚Äîwe have a backdoor route that combines all the elements you mentioned. Here‚Äôs how to make a stylish, paparazzi-free getaway:

Dimensional Shrinking Portal: Slip through the Quasar Quicksilver, a hidden portal disguised as a coat closet in the lobby. It‚Äôll shrink you down to the size of a neutrino, allowing you to bypass typical spatial detection systems‚Äîperfect for evading omnipresent cameras.

Atomic Slingshot Maneuver: Next, we‚Äôll launch you from the hyper-dense core of a neutron star fragment, propelling you through spacetime at a speed just shy of light itself. This slingshot will send out faint particle trails‚Äîsubtle but enough to keep any quantum observers focused on that one highly curious atom. It‚Äôll look as though you‚Äôve taken a completely different route.

Re-entry via Retrocausal Slipstream: Finally, you‚Äôll rematerialize through a slipstream just before you reach home, which will ‚Äúretroactively‚Äù hide your trail. You‚Äôll arrive with a hint of interdimensional glamour, just noticeable enough to attract attention from anyone who didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd notice you‚Äîbut never quite enough for them to say how they knew.

Bon voyage! May your journey be unnoticed yet undeniably felt.

I live in another city currently away from my hometown where the whole group still is,my friends work there,but I'm finishing up my degree,so I hang out with them once every 2 months maybe and obviously during the holidays,summer etc.
So this friend of mine,we always used to keep in touch especially via phone calls.Ive noticed over the years that whenever she would get into a new relationship after a while,slowly, I would lose contact with her,she would stop getting my calls more and more,or even reply to my texts.It never happens cold turkey,it's always gradual.
This past month she's been doing again this exact thing.Ive called her,she hasn't answered, she always texts back saying she will call me back,but never does.Im writing this post here,because I snapped, this weekend I was back to my hometown,and she didn't make an effort to see me because her bf was in town...So guess what,she spent all of her time with him,and she was too exhausted to see me ,even for a coffee or something. 
I hate this.But I'm also so mad at her for that,I don't even wanna talk to her about it.I just want to ignore the matter,and quit trying to be close to her,I don't know what to do.And I also don't like the fact that I'm feeling this way now,bottom line is that I love her,she will always be family to me.Obviously is a matter of priorities,because as I said,I also have a bf,and he's super important to me,im lucky that i have him,but I don't forget my friends when I date someone,anyone.Anyways...Any advice on that?",1,1730157478.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

The story I was told by my mother is that she found my father cheating on her, so she ran away with me.

She said my father didn‚Äôt feed her while they were together; he was very stingy. He would budget a single can of sardines to last for a day‚Äôs meal. While she was pregnant with me, he made her work, and all her salary went to him. She told me a lot more, but that‚Äôs all I can remember right now.

My dad hasn‚Äôt provided any support for me, and I‚Äôve never seen him since I was a child. A few years ago, he contacted me. We chatted sometimes, but I didn‚Äôt really enjoy replying to him because of what he did. And he doesn‚Äôt like it when we chat; he insists we call because he thinks my mom might be the one chatting with him instead of me. He bad-mouths my mom, saying she brainwashed me and that she‚Äôs lying to me. Then last year, I finally stopped replying to him because my mom told me to. I never listened to his side.

So yesterday, after a huge fight with my mom, I messaged my dad. I asked for his side of the story, and today we had a call.

It turns out that, according to him, my mom was the one who cheated on him with several guys whenever my dad was abroad for work. While they were still together, she supposedly worked as a prostitute or something, being paid for sex. She would even tell my dad about these guys, saying they were really good in bed.

He said my mom was already a drug addict even before they met, and that he‚Äôs the reason she stopped because he was very against it. Then, after I was born, their relationship became complicated because my mom would always leave to meet up with other guys or do drugs. Every time she ran away, my dad would give her money whenever she asked for it.

He said my mom has hated me ever since I was a child (this is true up to now). She would always say she didn‚Äôt like me because I was ugly (I‚Äôm actually quite pretty, lol), annoying, and that I ruined her life. He said my mom didn‚Äôt cook food at home, only cooked rice, and boiled water for coffee. My dad, on the other hand, would always try to make food. Apparently, I was always crying back then because my mom wouldn‚Äôt feed me, and my dad would try to cook potatoes for me since he didn‚Äôt know how to cook rice, but I didn‚Äôt like potatoes. So he would often ask the neighbors for rice.

He said my mom was very lazy, didn‚Äôt do laundry, didn‚Äôt cook, nothing. People even called my dad ""the battered husband"" because my mom was always angry at him. Every time they were about to separate, my mom would threaten him with something‚ÄîI forgot what exactly‚Äîbut she would always demand money.

After they separated, my mom ran away and took me with her so she could get money from my dad. He gave her money, but he never got to see me. My mom even filed a case against him and spoke with a lawyer about dropping the case if he paid her 150,000 pesos. My dad agreed because he was a foreigner and had no standing here in the Philippines. When the day to pay came, my mom didn‚Äôt sign to drop the case and demanded even more money, which I think my dad gave, and we haven‚Äôt seen each other since.

After a few years or months, they reached an agreement where my dad would provide support for me. At that time, he didn‚Äôt have a job anymore, only a small pension because something related to unpaid SSS due to my mom. My dad offered 50 euros as support, but my mom responded, ‚ÄúEat that money yourself. It‚Äôs not even enough for my makeup.‚Äù

1geg6lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1geg6lh/24f_being_the_only_single_friend_in_the_friend/,(24F) being the only single friend in the friend group has destroyed my self esteem,"24F and my three closest friends (mid 20‚ÄôsF) have all recently (within the last 6 months) gotten into relationships. This was a big deal as none of us had ever been in relationships before this point and while I started off being excited for them, I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that that‚Äôs now turned into straight up resentment.

I‚Äôve basically not been able to have a proper conversation with any of them in the past 6 months because everything spirals back to their boyfriends. If I mention how the coffee tastes good, it‚Äôs ‚Äúyeah but my boyfriend prefers it black so‚Äù, if I talk about how I had a cold, it‚Äôs ‚Äúoh my boyfriend was ill too, I spent the whole week with him‚Äù, or if I talk about how my tire went flat, it‚Äôs ‚Äúhaha I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry because my boyfriend would just pick me up‚Äù and it never just ends with these statements, the whole conversation becomes about their partners. 

I hadn‚Äôt spoken to one of the girls for several weeks and sent her message asking how she was, and in reply, I got a 10 minute long voice note with the first minute being about her work, and the other 9 minutes was her talking about cuddling with the boyfriend, playing footsie with him under the table at their office, their sexual escapades (wish I was joking). 

I guess I‚Äôve just been feeling particularly bad lately because myself and one of the girls had - since we were 18/19 - been planning a trip to Asia, and are both now in a financial position to be able to actually do it, after years of deliberation. I brought it up with her the other day and she looked a bit awkward and was like ‚Äúyeah, well actually my boyfriend and I were planning to go away for a few months together‚Ä¶‚Äù, basically I had been replaced, this was very clear in her delivery. 

I wish that I could be a ‚Äúgirls girl‚Äù in this situation and feel happy for them, but‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve struggled with the classic anxiety/depression combo for many years and it‚Äôs basically destroyed my ability to form relationships, so dating does not come easily to me. Men have never shown much interest in me, whether I‚Äôm just living my day to day life, or feeling beautiful all dressed up on a night out. When I am constantly barraged by the intimate details of these very intense and loving relationships, I feel so alone that it‚Äôs painful, but if I were to bring it up I would look pathetic and jealous, and I don‚Äôt want to be pitied by my friends. 

I feel ugly and quite frankly unlovable any time I engage in conversation with these friends, and like I‚Äôm no longer part of this ‚Äúbigger thing‚Äù. I also understand that life is not about having a boyfriend/girlfriend, but at the end of the day I am only human and I crave that kind of connection. 

And to be very clear, I‚Äôve been nothing but supportive of their relationships, cheering them on, gassing them up, giving advice where I feel able to. I would never, ever try to sabotage what any of them have just because of my own saltiness, but it‚Äôs becoming overwhelming internally. 

Amy advice‚Ä¶?

tl;dr all of my friends have recently gotten into relationships and talk about them nonstop, which is crushing my self esteem. ",1,1730157234.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1geg6ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/saxoaustralia/comments/1geg6ao/silver_and_platinum_see_strong_demand_crude/,Silver and platinum see strong demand. Crude length cut ahead of Israeli strike | Commodities | Saxo Australia,"**29/10/2024 By Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo** 

# Key points:

* Our weekly Commitment of Traders update highlights futures positions and changes made by hedge funds across forex and commodities during the week to last Tuesday, 22 October.
* Speculators' demand for USD accelerated, leading the most aggressive four-week period of EUR selling since November 2015.
* Some risk aversion was seen in commodities despite broad price strength, with energy, industrial metals, and softs seeing net selling.
* Demand for investment metals continued, with funds focusing on silver and platinum, both reaching levels of positioning which, on four previous occasions since 2020, proved unsustainable.

# Forex:

Speculators demand for dollars accelerated in the week to 22 October, when the Bloomberg Dollar index rose 0.7% amid a rise in US Treasury yields as traders positioned themselves for the risk of potential Red Sweep on November 5. A result that may lead to excessive government spending, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio higher, while fueling inflation fears, potentially slowing further the pace of expected rate cuts, thereby making the Greenback relatively more attractive on rate differential perspective.  
  
Overall, the net dollar long against eight IMM currency futures jumped USD 10.9 billion to a 3-1/2 month high. Except the AUD, selling was broad led by JPY and CAD, and not least EUR where the most aggressive four-week selling period since November 2015 resulted in the biggest net short in two years after speculators sold 45.7k contracts, the equivalent of USD 6.2 billion.¬†

# Commodities:

In the latest reporting week, the Bloomberg Commodity Index rallied 1.8%, thereby fully recouping losses in the previous week. All sectors except softs saw higher prices, led by precious metals where all metals saw demand amid haven demand ahead of the US elections, with silver jumping more than 10%, after breaking resistance-now-support at USD 32.50. Elsewhere the energy sector, except natural gas, grains and livestock all recorded gains, while industrial metals were muted as the China stimulus rally deflated.  
  
Managed money accounts, such as hedge funds and CTAs, responded to these developments by a mixed and somewhat counterintuitive reaction, not least the energy sector where traders for a second week sold into the rally. Highlighting a market where traders, correctly had started to price out the risk of a major disruption to oil flows from the Middle East. Crude oil slumped more than 4% in early Monday trading after Israel's limited attack on Iran avoided the nation's energy infrastructure, thereby reducing the risk of a disruption and potentially signalling a de-escalation. Prices have now retraced most of the early October China stimulus and Iran supply risk boost, weighed down by sluggish demand and the risk of rising supply of currently unwanted barrels from OPEC+ next month.  
  
In metals, the silver net long jumped to a 31-month high at 47.4k contracts, a level which on four previous occasions since mid-2020 had triggered profit taking and long-liquidation. It is however also worth noting that the all-time high reached in April 2017 was more than double that at 99k contracts. The net long in platinum also reached a 31-month high at 25k contracts, and just like silver, a level which on several occasions since 2020 signaled a top and reversal in prices. The palladium short was cut ahead of an end of week surge triggered by Russian sanctions talk, while copper selling continued as the China stimulus impact continued to fade.  
  
Grains traded mixed with selling of soybeans being more than offset by demand for soybean oil and corn, the behavior in the latter highlighting a great deal of uncertainty after both the gross long (+38k) and the gross short (+23k) received a boost. Finally, the softs sector, except cotton, saw selling amid improved weather outlook in key production regions sending cocoa and coffee prices lower. Livestock, an area we normally do not give that much attention, has seen five consecutive weeks of buying drive the live cattle net long to a one-year high at 90k and lean hogs.

# What is the Commitments of Traders report?

The COT reports are issued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the ICE Exchange Europe for Brent crude oil and gas oil. They are released every Friday after the U.S. close with data from the week ending the previous Tuesday. They break down the open interest in futures markets into different groups of users depending on the asset class.

Commodities: Producer/Merchant/Processor/User, Swap dealers,¬†Managed Money¬†and other  
Financials: Dealer/Intermediary; Asset Manager/Institutional;¬†Leveraged Funds¬†and other  
Forex: A broad breakdown between commercial and¬†non-commercial¬†(speculators)

The main reasons why we focus primarily on the behavior of speculators, such as hedge funds and trend-following CTA's are:

* They are likely to have¬†tight stops¬†and¬†no underlying exposure¬†that is being hedged
* This makes them¬†most reactive to changes¬†in fundamental or technical price developments
* It provides views about¬†major trends¬†but also helps to decipher when a¬†reversal¬†is looming

Do note that¬†this group tends to¬†anticipate,¬†accelerate, and¬†amplify¬†price changes that have been set in motion by¬†fundamentals. Being followers of momentum, this strategy often sees this group of traders buy into strength and sell into weakness, meaning that they are often found holding the biggest long near the peak of a cycle or the biggest short position ahead of a through in the market.

For context, my mom and dad separated when I was around one year old. The story I was told by my mother is that she found my father cheating on her, so she ran away with me.

She said my father didn‚Äôt feed her while they were together; he was very stingy. He would budget a single can of sardines to last for a day‚Äôs meal. While she was pregnant with me, he made her work, and all her salary went to him. She told me a lot more, but that‚Äôs all I can remember right now.

My dad hasn‚Äôt provided any support for me, and I‚Äôve never seen him since I was a child. A few years ago, he contacted me. We chatted sometimes, but I didn‚Äôt really enjoy replying to him because of what he did. And he doesn‚Äôt like it when we chat; he insists we call because he thinks my mom might be the one chatting with him instead of me. He bad-mouths my mom, saying she brainwashed me and that she‚Äôs lying to me. Then last year, I finally stopped replying to him because my mom told me to. I never listened to his side.

So yesterday, after a huge fight with my mom, I messaged my dad. I asked for his side of the story, and today we had a call.

It turns out that, according to him, my mom was the one who cheated on him with several guys whenever my dad was abroad for work. While they were still together, she supposedly worked as a prostitute or something, being paid for sex. She would even tell my dad about these guys, saying they were really good in bed.

He said my mom was already a drug addict even before they met, and that he‚Äôs the reason she stopped because he was very against it. Then, after I was born, their relationship became complicated because my mom would always leave to meet up with other guys or do drugs. Every time she ran away, my dad would give her money whenever she asked for it.

He said my mom has hated me ever since I was a child (this is true up to now). She would always say she didn‚Äôt like me because I was ugly (I‚Äôm actually quite pretty, lol), annoying, and that I ruined her life. He said my mom didn‚Äôt cook food at home, only cooked rice, and boiled water for coffee. My dad, on the other hand, would always try to make food. Apparently, I was always crying back then because my mom wouldn‚Äôt feed me, and my dad would try to cook potatoes for me since he didn‚Äôt know how to cook rice, but I didn‚Äôt like potatoes. So he would often ask the neighbors for rice.

He said my mom was very lazy, didn‚Äôt do laundry, didn‚Äôt cook, nothing. People even called my dad ""the battered husband"" because my mom was always angry at him. Every time they were about to separate, my mom would threaten him with something‚ÄîI forgot what exactly‚Äîbut she would always demand money.

After they separated, my mom ran away and took me with her so she could get money from my dad. He gave her money, but he never got to see me. My mom even filed a case against him and spoke with a lawyer about dropping the case if he paid her 150,000 pesos. My dad agreed because he was a foreigner and had no standing here in the Philippines. When the day to pay came, my mom didn‚Äôt sign to drop the case and demanded even more money, which I think my dad gave, and we haven‚Äôt seen each other since.

After a few years or months, they reached an agreement where my dad would provide support for me. At that time, he didn‚Äôt have a job anymore, only a small pension because something related to unpaid SSS due to my mom. My dad offered 50 euros as support, but my mom responded, ‚ÄúEat that money yourself. It‚Äôs not even enough for my makeup.‚Äù

So yeah, he told me more, but I‚Äôve forgotten, and I‚Äôm tired of typing. So, was I wrong to contact my dad and go against my mom‚Äôs wishes? And is it wrong that I believe my dad more because almost everything he said matches what I‚Äôve experienced with my mom?",3,1730156953.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

I mentioned that I‚Äôm going to study in his country next year, and he said he hoped we could meet up sometime for coffee.

Everything was going well, until about a few weeks ago. He texted saying ‚ÄúYou know? I always keep an open mind. When we meet, I also hope you keep an open mind in case we develop feelings for each other‚Äù. I was like WHAT üíÄ Never once did I flirt with him or cause any misunderstandings. And to be honest, his opinions have been bothering me lately because, while I respect them, the age gap is truly showing we have very different priorities and opinions about the state of the world.

I hate the fact that he doesn‚Äôt respect what I say. I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to date anyone‚Äù and he‚Äôs already thinking of a possible relationship. I mean, I‚Äôve felt attracted to older guys before, but he‚Äôs not one of them and I‚Äôve never shown any romantic interest towards him. 

The Gen Z in me wants to ghost but I want to be polite. What should I say? Or should I just block him?

I love animals. I lowkey hate my parents beagles. It‚Äôs all due to my parents spoiling them. 

They are constantly looking for or begging for food. If you get up they both jump up even from a dead sleep and stick to your side hoping you go to the kitchen. God help you if you do because they will jump on your legs and whine for a treat while you‚Äôre just trying to make a damn cup of coffee. Commands to get down are useless. They never follow to be with you it‚Äôs always with the hope of food. My parents will give them something every time.

They beg at your feet as close as they can when you eat. My parents give them scraps. I‚Äôve started taking my food upstairs and eating in my room but they will figure it out and scratch or whine at the door. Same with snacks.

They bark at everything, all day long. A leaf falling outside the window. A scent of a squirrel (we are in a woodsy area so that‚Äôs constant). When they start the barking chorus inside they get put outside where it continues. It‚Äôs so loud it hurts my ears inside the house. One of them is a bit dim and will just bark at the air and they get each other going. Yelling at them or squirting with water helps sometimes but not really. I‚Äôm sure the neighbors hate them. It‚Äôs impossible to relax on their nice deck with these crazies yelping at smells. 

Right now my stepmother can‚Äôt eat because of a colonoscopy and the dogs are staring into her soul at her feet for the last 20 mins waiting for their dog treats that they‚Äôre used to getting along with dinner table scraps. She gave in and gave them each a handful. If you can believe it it used to be worse! they got overweight and were put on a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù and have lost weight. 

Not looking for advice just venting. They won‚Äôt listen to anyone tell them the dogs are spoiled or complain about their behavior so I stay quiet. What is so funny to me is they claim one of them is ‚Äúthe smartest dog they‚Äôve ever met‚Äù but honestly how smart can she be where she barks like a banshee at the same smells, sights and sounds she‚Äôs been around for 12 years??

I tried all of recommended espresso grind settings and i still have this issue.

So basically whatever i do it sticks to the shower screen. (The sticking is not directly sticking to the shower screen, the puck is always wet when i remove the PF and some grounds on the shower screen) I put 16-18G finer ground it happens. So i done a bit coarser and put 15G it sticks again. Even if it doesnt really sticks puck is always wet.

And another important part is when the machine extract coffee, the sound of machine is decrasing time to time.  It sounds like machine having difficulty while pulling a shot (This only happens when i do with finer ground).

Otherwise the coffee tastes good, not sour or different. But when i see that people dont have this issues with this machine in Youtube, i wonder and want to fix the issue. I hope I could explain it.

1gefwhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gefwhv/aio_friends_dont_care/,AIO: Friends don‚Äôt care,"Recently I have been accepted into Physician Assistant School after 2 cycles of applying. For those that don‚Äôt know, getting into PA school is really difficult and is a huge accomplishment. Leading up to applying I had to take many challenging courses in undergrad, worked as a tech in a hospital, accumulated a bunch of volunteer hours and many other experiences. 

My friends and family in college saw the struggles and self doubt I experienced within my classes and overall the path to becoming a PA. 
One of my closest friends is currently in medical school. They took a couple difficult prerequisite classes with me where we would often help each other. I saw my friend apply and be accepted into med school. I helped edit some of their application essays and offered the support I could. Our whole friend group did. However, once I was the one applying to school it was radio silence or lack of interest/need to help me. It made me feel like I didn‚Äôt matter the way my friend did to everyone else.

To fast forward and to get to the point. It has been over a month since my acceptance and I don‚Äôt feel celebrated. I‚Äôve made it a point to give little treats to my friends here and there, especially my friend in med school, to show them support and make them feel special. I do things such as buy a friend a coffee after a hard exam or create a little congratulations gift basket, or send an encouraging text. I don‚Äôt know how to say this without sounding entitled or stuck
up but after my acceptance I expected my friends to do something to celebrate me and when they didn‚Äôt i felt upset and disappointed. I‚Äôm not expecting anything big or expensive, just something to make me feel special and celebrated like going out for a meal. 

Another note, as the oldest sibling my parents have never ‚Äúhad to worry about me‚Äù so accomplishments like this don‚Äôt seem like as big of a deal to my parents. Of course they have expressed they are proud of me but it has still contributed to these feelings.

I don‚Äôt want to always have to ask to be celebrated but at the same time I can‚Äôt expect others to know what I‚Äôm thinking. Idk am I overreacting? or are my feelings valid?",3,1730156485.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1gefvif,https://www.reddit.com/r/deppVheardtrial/comments/1gefvif/johnny_depp_and_the_mark_hotel/,Johnny Depp and the Mark Hotel,"I was just looking into this and discovered that Depp has provided multiple explanations/excuses for why he was angry enough to smash up the Mark Hotel. 

1. An armadillo did it

2. ‚ÄúA. I had a ‚Äî at the time I had a friend that had been a friend for a very long time, and he had, for the lack of a better description, screwed me over, if you will.‚Äù  ‚Äî UK trial Depp

3. The night security rubbed him the wrong way: ‚ÄúHe decided that he was going to ‚ÄòLet me get in the famous guy‚Äôs face.‚Äô I don‚Äôt really take too well to that.‚Äù

I have seen references to officers asking Depp for autographs:

>As he was taken to the 19th Precinct station house, she related, Depp said to another officer, referring to Perez: ""I don't think she likes me. But if she saw me at a mall, I bet she would ask me for an autograph.""
>
>""No, Johnny,"" Perez responded, ""I don't think so.""

>‚ÄúThe next thing you know, you're in jail and all these female cops want your autograph and the papers are making up funny names to call you.‚Äù

He seems a bit self-obsessed. 

>""It's good for them,"" Depp says. ""Now they can say they have this little bit of history, this ridiculous morsel of history. They can say, 'We had Johnny Depp arrested.'‚Äù

""The owner approached my publicist about two years after the incident,"" he recalled, ""and thanked her‚Äîsaid, 'It was so great for us that Johnny got arrested at our hotel and sent to jail.
You can't imagine the business we got out of it!'""

Did that *really* happen? *Really?*

He has minimized his destruction:

‚ÄúSure, trashed [referring to terminology] is fine. I just think that there are ‚Äî I mean, when I left the room, it was not unlivable. You just had to put a new vase in, maybe a cup or two.‚Äù

>According to the police report, Keegan listed ten damaged items: two broken seventeenth-century picture frames and prints, a china lamp stand, a Chinese pot, a shattered glass tabletop, broken coffee-table legs, broken wooden shelves, a shattered vase, a cigarette burn on the carpet, and a red desk chair.

He explained during the UK trial that he feels he did nothing wrong:

>A. I do not think I have a problem.
>
>Q. You still maintain that?
>
>A. Yes.
>
>Q. So, if you were not angry -‚Äî
>
>A. No, I was angry.
>
>Q. You were angry?
>
>A. Yes, but that does not mean I have an anger problem.
>
>Q. Well, did you find it difficult to control your anger on this occasion?
>
>A. On that occasion, I chose to express my anger.

The violence at the Mark Hotel was not discussed in the Virginia trial aside from a quote being read to Depp from the interviews afterward: ‚ÄúI have a lot of love inside me and a lot of anger inside me as well. If I love somebody, then I'm going to love them. If I'm angry and I've got to lash out or hit somebody, I'm going to do it, and I don't care what the repercussions are. Anger doesn't pay rent - It's got to go. It's got to be evicted.‚Äù

He was back to violence hours after his arrest: 

>The item quoted one man's version that Depp ""slammed into me"" and said, ""Fuck you."" 
>
>Depp tells it differently: ""This guy walked past me in the bar. He pulled out what resembled a penis‚Äîbut I have a sneaking suspicion it might have been a thimble, this goofy fucking guy‚Äîand said something like, `Suck my dick.' I'd just gotten out of jail. They'd said, ‚ÄòYou're to stay out of trouble for six months.' Meanwhile, it's less than six hours later. My first instinct was to‚Ä¶ we all have that animal instinct inside of us... your instinct is, Go for the throat.""

I have not seen any articles getting Kate Moss‚Äôs side of the story, which is unusual, but Johnny says she slept through the whole thing:

> Johnny Depp on Friday admitted that he trashed a hotel room during a meltdown in the 1990s while his then-girlfriend Kate Moss slept ‚Äî though he denied ever physically abusing the supermodel, according to a report.
[‚Ä¶] Asked where Moss, then 20, was at the time, the Golden Globe winner said, ‚ÄúShe was in the bedroom sleeping.‚Äù

However, Depp‚Äôs hotel neighbor was unable to sleep due to the racket and suggests she was not sleeping after all. 

>Later that same night, the lead singer of The Who, Roge Daltrey called the front desk to complain about the noise Johnny and Kate were making.
>
>""On a scale of 1 to 10, I give Johnny Depp and Kate Moss a one for their ability to trash rooms. It took them a long time to do it. The Who would have done the same thing in just sixty seconds,"" Daltrey told the press about the incident.

Kate Moss was not arrested or charged, which is common in domestic violence calls when one person can be determined by police to be the most significant offender.

>This incident set off a frenzy of speculation, rumor and innuendo in the tabloid press as well as the legitimate (?) press. Surely, Kate and Johnny were through. NAW! On September 24, they appeared together and quite affection at the premiere of Johnny's movie, ""Ed Wood"" at the New York film festival. The next day they graciously attended a Pediatric AIDS Foundation carnival where they manned a hockey game booth and assisted children in tossing balls for the game.

I guess he went right to repairing his image.

1gefsxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/1gefsxn/weird_interaction_with_a_guy_involving_an_asthma/,Weird interaction with a guy involving an 'asthma attack' and alcohol wipes,"I had a very odd interaction with a man at the corner of Pacific and Clinton in Cobble Hill a few nights ago. It was about 730pm, I was walking down the street listening to a podcast, when I happened to make eye contact with an older man standing by the side of the street. Since I made eye contact, and he was gesturing to me, I felt obliged to take out my headphones and see what he needed.

The first thing he says to me is.. 'Can you help me open these'. I think.. simple enough. I look to see that he is pointing to some alcohol wipes in his hand.. the ones you get after getting some finger-licking good Kennedys. I proceed to help him open them, and as I do, he is telling me that he is having an asthma attack, and he needs me to wipe the wipes over his neck and face.

This seems like an odd request to me at the time, but I see that he has an inhaler in his hand, and he seems to be struggling, so i proceed to wipe his neck.. and then his face (as directed). As I'm doing this, he keeps telling me to do it harder and harder, and is pointing to all different areas on his neck and face. As I am on the second wipe, and realizing what a weird situation this is that I am rubbing a mans face as he's yelling harder and harder.. I pull away, tell him I hope he's okay.. and start walking away. Before I leave, I notice that he's holding a brown bag, and in it.. is a bunch of alcohol wipe wrappers and used wipes.. makes me think I wasn't his first (but I hope I was the best). Another odd thing I remembered is that he said he would buy me a cup of coffee.. mind you it's 730pm.

For context.. the man was older, late 50s/early 60s, bald.. and spoke with an accent, might have been middle eastern. 

I have since spoken to a few doctor friends, and they have all said that there is no medical reason that alcohol wipes would help an asthma attack, and are pretty sure I was a victim of some weird fella's kink.. and I am leaning towards this as well. 

Was just wondering if anyone has ever encountered anything remotely similar, or could possibly shed some light on what kind of kink I helped fulfill..",30,1730156229.0,Brooklyn,11,0.92,False
1gefstk,https://www.reddit.com/r/publicdefenders/comments/1gefstk/need_advice_dealing_with_a_golden_boy/,Need advice dealing with a golden boy,"Newer PD here. There is an older attorney in my office, I'll call him Bob. Bob is ten to thirty minutes late to court every day. Bob routinely asks others around him to complete parts of his work that he considers trivial. Bob CONSTANTLY uses inappropriate language, is openly hostile to one of the several managing attorneys, and occasionally refuses assignments.

The other day, Bob was about twenty minutes late to a pretrial calendar, came in without his jacket, talking about ""it's fucking hot in here"" and ""we need a fucking fan or some shit,"" etc., and had a client waiting who had complained about not having gotten a call back. I told him ""Hey, Mr. XXXX was waiting to speak with you,"" and Bob says something like ""I got that asshole's fucking shit dismissed on the way in here."" He then didn't talk to Mr. XXXX for half an hour while he was doing some other things, called him up on the record, the state dismissed, and Bob went on to the next thing while Mr. XXXX seemed confused about what had happened.

The managing attorney requires that I ask Bob for input on any evidentiary motions I file. He routinely doesn't look at them until the night before or the morning of the hearing, way past when I could have amended the motion, and he sometimes makes me seek continuances so that I can redo them his way. The managing attorney also requires that I ask Bob to review cases before I confirm them for case setting. He gives me notes like striking through sections of my cross examination with a note that says ""what's this gonna do"", and ""why this guy"" on my direct examination questions. Many of the briefs in the brief bank were written by Bob and I feel like the managing attorneys are going to demand an explanation if I don't use them. I feel very condescended to have someone looking over my shoulder that way and second-guessing everything I do.

Last month, in a burst of anger I asked one of the managing attorneys about Bob's conduct and demeanor. He kind of grimaced, and everything was kind of between the lines, but he essentially said the reason why no one does anything about Bob is because he is constantly in trial and almost always wins. On more than one occasion in the past, when he did get guilty, he appealed, won, new case law was created, and the case was dismissed after remand or he won the retrial. I could easily tell you which ones because he has the opinions taped to his window behind his desk, which I find incredibly arrogant. He also has a tally on his whiteboard that appears to track wins and losses, which is also arrogant and minimizes his clients and their lives to markers on a scoreboard, which is just inappropriate.

It looks like because he always wins, they just put up with literally anything. He plays computer games in his office, he smokes like a fiend all day, he's foul-mouthed, late, not overtly rude to his clients but not very nice either, always reeking of coffee and cigarettes, not always dressed appropriately, not always groomed appropriately, shows up late, leaves early, almost refuses to engage in cases that don't look like they're headed for trial, and then just wins at trial and it all goes away. It's not like he's a rainmaker; we're public defenders. It makes me super angry that far from Bob's behavior being a problem, it seems like he's on track to get promoted soon.

Am I being unreasonable here, or is there something I could say to management about this? So far I can't even get them to agree that Bob is a problem, let alone agreeing that something should be done about it. Is my anger justifiable? Is it justifiable to a degree that I could go higher up with it?",11,1730156221.0,publicdefenders,101,0.63,False

First thing I wanna say, English is not my first language so please no hate for that. 
So I need to start at the beginning. I have a boyfriend (25) wee will call him Bob. We have a good relationship, we rarely argue our s*x life is really good.. etc. But the one thing I really hate about my boyfriend is that, that he (I would say) really friendly to others. In the past I was cheated on so I‚Äôm very careful about everything. We started like ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù and we had boundaries. The first one always was no other girls/boys. He broke that promise 3 times and I every time forgive him. Then we got in relationship and everything was fine, until his best friend found a girlfriend. We will call the best friend John and his girlfriend Lili. One day the boys wanted to introduce as. I was getting ready and they went to a coffee shop. Then Bob, John and Lili come to pick me up. I didn‚Äôt know Lili before but in a second I got in to the car she was unpleasant. I didn‚Äôt care that much I was looking forward for the night. We went in to the bar and there it all started. Long story short my boyfriend Bob and Lili, they talked for like 3 hours straight, John and I.. we were pissed off. Every time I wanted to say something Bob put his hand in to my face to wait. After 3 long hours I just sat there, sad and angry. Then I saw that Lili was scratching his hand and she was very flirty, boobs out and you know that look. That was the last thing for me, I grabbed Bob‚Äôs hand and take him out. I wanted to scream at him but I just started crying. After I put my self together I told Bob what was my problem, that he didn‚Äôt include me in a conversation at all, the hand thigh and the touching. He told me that he wanted to include me ( to explain: I can talk about anything and everything BUT the only thing I cannot is food, my body, anorexia etc‚Ä¶. That was the thing he wanted to include me in, so yeah) I told him I don‚Äôt want him to talk to her anymore, he apologized and we went back in. She wanted to start a conversation again but this time I didn‚Äôt let that happened. But this isn‚Äôt the thing why I‚Äôm writing this, this was just one example of many (not too many but many). From this incident I‚Äôm very jealous and I don‚Äôt want him talking or anything to girls I or he don‚Äôt know. He is also a big gamer. I had some problem with my game and I‚Äôm really not in to computers so I called him, he was in a game and told me to wait, so I waited. I heard some girl calling out his name from the headphones, so I naturally asked who she is ( he never plays with girls ) he told me that he and his friends found her on the game and added her to the call. I was a little pissed off because I told him to tell me things like this ( I tell him every time someone texts me or whatever) I would not overreact if this was a first or second time, but it wasn‚Äôt. I was pissed of, i ended the call (and went to cryü§™) he texted me after an hour what am I doing, I didn‚Äôt text back then he started to ask what‚Äôs going on etc.. I told him, he laughed in to my face and told that I‚Äôm overreacting, that I‚Äôm childish etc.. and he didn‚Äôt apologize. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the wrong here. So AITAH ?

But there was only about a coffee mugs worth so even if it was gross, at least it‚Äôs just a little bit. Then I started drinking. Over the next couple hours I had my 3L in the form of Gatorade, hydralyte, miso broth, chicken broth, lemon ginger tea, regular water, jello, sprite.  Variety was key. 

About 1-2 hours in I felt/hear an epic gurgle that let me know it was go time. Had 1 painless BM and then went back to watching tv. After another 90mins I was getting worried that it wasn‚Äôt working but then had another 3 or so painless bms over the next couple hours.  I followed the tips on this forum and used the zinc cream and wet wipes.  

By 11 I felt like it was over.  Unfortunately I was woken up at 12 by another loud gurgle (which was probably the pills kicking in) and had another couple bathroom trips over the next hour.  Again, painless, no cramping no big deal.  I‚Äôve had worse nights with a flare. 

MORNING

I had to wake up at 5:30 to take my next sachet.  This time it was harder to drink the required additional fluids as I was tired and nauseated from not having solid foods.  I powered through just fine and was able to experiment with different fluids. White Gatorade for the win! This one kicked in sooner and was done about an hour or so before I needed to leave for my scope.  But as the night before, no cramping.  I wasn‚Äôt camped out in the bathroom either.  Just watched reruns of the office on tv in the bedroom and went to the bathroom when I needed. 

I was so worried about cramping.  There was none.  I was worried about feeling super sick, I was a bit nauseated but nothing crazy. Sure it was urgent when I had to go, but honestly not as urgent as I‚Äôve had in some flares. 

I was told my prep was excellent. Completed the scope no problem.  

Would give purgodan prep 4.5/5 stars (on a scale of preps lol). ",1,1730156044.0,UlcerativeColitis,0,1.0,False
