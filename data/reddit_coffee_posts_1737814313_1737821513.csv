Context: I (25F) have this friend (26M) and we knew each other by name only for about 8 years ago but we never talked. A few months ago, we got reconnected since we‚Äôre mutuals sa soc med, talked and met for a few times then natigil. Recently, I focused on myself and we talked again, this time iba na yung purpose ng mga labas namin unlike before na coffee and just eating out lang. Ngayon we do outdoor activities na since we have the same goal (fitness). It was always wholesome, something na hindi ako sanay na meron palang may pure intentions kaya siguro napapaisip ako this time. Most single men kasi na kakilala ko esp at that age gusto lang ng casual thing/fubu/no strings attached type these days.

I don‚Äôt want to ask him directly about this since I‚Äôm afraid baka ma-taint yung friendship namin as of now especially we have a lot of plans pa to do.

1i9q0gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/JujutsuPowerScaling/comments/1i9q0gk/yuta_could_solo_sukuna_and_gojo_gege/,Yuta could solo sukuna and gojo- Gege,"Gojo wasn‚Äôt just hyping Yuta up when he said, ‚ÄúYuta will be as good as me.‚Äù No, he was warning us all that Yuta is built different, with potential unlike anyone else. And let‚Äôs be clear: Gojo‚Äôs words are basically Gege‚Äôs writing. If Gojo says something, it‚Äôs because Gege wants us to know it‚Äôs improtant.( Don‚Äôt care about kenjaku because more stronger more important their words are)

Now, Gojo didn‚Äôt say Yuta would surpass him. He said Yuta could be as good as him. But what Gojo left unsaid is this: if Yuta had Sukuna‚Äôs mentality, he wouldn‚Äôt just match Gojo‚Äîhe‚Äôd surpass Sukuna. That‚Äôs the truth Gege has been hinting at all along.

Let‚Äôs break it down:
	Gojo - THE GOD of Jujutsu. The guy everyone looks up to. The man who stood toe-to-toe with Sukuna and almost brought him down.
		Gojo says Yuta has the potential to reach his level, which is already insane. But potential alone isn‚Äôt enough to surpass someone like Sukuna.
		Sukuna isn‚Äôt just strong because of his cursed energy or techniques‚Äîhe‚Äôs strong because he has the mindset of ruthless, ambitious, and completely unshakable.

And here‚Äôs the key: If Yuta haddd Sukuna‚Äôs mindset, the kind of drive and hunger for dominance that Sukuna has, he‚Äôd blow past Sukuna and become the strongest sorcerer to ever exist.

Without Sukuna‚Äôs mindset, Yuta will be good.But to truly surpass Sukuna, he‚Äôd need to embrace that same brutal ambition. Sukuna‚Äôs mentality is what makes him the King of Curses. If Yuta could do that, he‚Äôd be unstoppable.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on EoS Yuta. The Yuta who has grandkids in the epilogue? THAT Yuta is going to be a freaking monster. With decades of experience, he would unlock a power beyond even Sukuna‚Äôs comprehension. And if that Yuta had Sukuna‚Äôs mindset? Game over for sukuna and gojo. They  just be another name on the list of people Yuta obliterated.

When that happens, Gojo‚Äôs gonna be chilling in the afterlife, sipping his cursed coffee, like, ‚ÄúI told you all this day would come.‚Äù

Sukuna and Gojo , pack it up. If Yuta had your mindset, you wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance.

I‚Äôve tried to write a summary of this situation quite a few times without success. I‚Äôm not sure why. Perhaps I wasn‚Äôt ready to face the reality of the situation? I don‚Äôt know, but my feelings towards this one person are too strong to ignore no matter how hard I try.

I (24M) fell in love with my classmate (21F), and I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre friends, a ‚Äúsituationship,‚Äù or nothing at all. I also can‚Äôt tell if she has positive feelings towards me at all or if she hates me. I‚Äôm very confused.

I developed several addictions in my senior year of high school (2018-2019). I started drinking, smoking weed, vaping, and even fell into the realm of psychedelics. These addictions snowballed into a failed transition into my freshman and sophomore years of college. It took a lot of effort, but after a lot of introspection and hard work, I was finally able to transfer to university this past fall for my junior year of university.¬†

On the first day of class, I met this lovely girl named Sarah. Granted, I was ready to embrace the typical ‚Äúcollege lifestyle‚Äù at this point and was looking to talk to as many pretty girls as I could (regrettably). She was one of these girls, and we exchanged snapchats and began to casually communicate. I was talking to other girls too, and I had no intention of seriously dating anyone. However, Sarah and I ended up having two classes together back-to-back on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Over the course of the semester, we had spent almost every day together talking, walking to class, and learning more about each other.

After we initially met and began to talk more, part of me was growing a strong attraction towards her. I have experience with attraction, and I‚Äôve had my fair share of wins and losses in the past in terms of my love life. I‚Äôve learned to trust my gut and be honest when it comes to feelings, and that was the mindset I embraced when it came to this woman. The chemistry between us was potent and seductive, and each moment we spent together I knew we were putting our best foot forward to present ourselves in our best light.¬†

I‚Äôm six feet tall, 175 pounds of mostly muscle (I work out quite a lot, helped me with my addictions and mental health problems), I have a good job as an immunizer at CVS, and I focus hard on my goals in life. She‚Äôs at least half a foot shorter than me, blonde, blue eyes, and radiantly beautiful and confident. To me, we felt like a power couple without even dating or hanging out outside of class at this point.¬†¬†

Anyway, I was convinced she liked me at this point given how much she was talking to me (we had the heart on Snapchat for weeks, we were texting a lot, seeing each other on campus, etc.) We were by no means smothering each other, I could sense we both value our independence and approached each other to a healthy extent. So, I suggested we hang out sometime to which she agreed immediately. We made plans to go out to eat and hang out around town.¬†

It was a Friday night, and I made my way to her apartment to pick her up. When I showed up, she suggested that we stay in instead of going out to eat, which I was okay with. We smoked a joint that I brought and cuddled on her bed. After some conversation, I kissed her. We started making out and things started getting intense but before either of us could remove our clothes, she stopped and suggested we don‚Äôt go any further. I was used to girls only wanting to hook up and have sex, so this shocked me and ultimately made me like her even more because of her level of self-respect. We were able to calm things down and continued to cuddle and share more about ourselves. I learned a lot about her, and she learned a lot about me. She gave me a tarot reading, after which we made out again. She ended up telling me I had to leave because she was going to a rave with her best friend (who she mentioned she ‚Äúused to be gay with,‚Äù which was a major red flag to my female roommate but didn‚Äôt mean much to me.)¬†

I kissed her goodnight, and things went back to the way they were- texting frequently, walking to class, etc. Yet, it was at this point that thing began to change. I began to pursue her exclusively, made time for her, bought her coffee and brought it to class, sent her notes if she missed class, etc. I was displaying obvious signs of wanting to be her boyfriend, and she was aware of this. She responded to this by ghosting me, making excuses to not hang out, and just generally avoiding me.¬†

I could tell things were starting to get weird and if I haven‚Äôt mentioned it already, I‚Äôve been through this before. I didn‚Äôt want to lose this connection with her so one night after being ghosted for hours (probably two weeks after our initial hangout), I texted her that I don‚Äôt want to force her into an uncomfortable situation and that I‚Äôd be happy if we just stayed friends. She read and answered this immediately (like she used to, which was weird) and agreed. She said she felt bad and that she values me and said, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just stay friends for now.‚Äù I left it at that and was comfortable with no guarantee of any romantic outcome with her.¬†

Things kind of felt back to the way they were before here; she would text me much more frequently, walk with me, and acted like nothing happened between us. The rest of the semester can be summed up like this. She went back and forth between texting me every day to being cold and distant. The only other major event that happened between us was Halloween night (her 21^(st)¬†birthday). Apparently, I fucked up that night, as we both attended the same Halloween party, and I made her uncomfortable. All I remember was giving her two massive hugs and smoking up her and her friends. I didn‚Äôt try to kiss her or anything like that, and while numerous girls pulled me away from her and tried to engage with me, I found myself acting unnecessarily loyal to Sarah and denying any advances from these girls.¬†

Her and her friends left abruptly, and she didn‚Äôt answer any of my texts for the rest of the weekend. The following Monday, she ignored me in both classes and avoided me at all costs (minus this judgmental and menacing glare I got from her at the start of class.) I didn‚Äôt understand this, so I texted her to see if everything‚Äôs okay to which she said, ‚ÄúI told you how I felt, and you just didn‚Äôt listen.‚Äù Again, I didn‚Äôt understand this, but I didn‚Äôt want to argue with her. I apologized and moved on, and again, she was back to acting like my buddy again without me having to do anything.¬†

She spent the rest of the semester, like I said, acting hot and cold. She‚Äôd suggest I come onto her school radio show numerous times, but never explicitly invited me. She‚Äôd send me songs but would leave me on read. She really seemed to want my attention but never gave me much back. Again, I was okay with this at the time, but now it‚Äôs driving me nuts.

She left my Merry Christmas text on read, and she hasn‚Äôt responded to my New Year‚Äôs Eve ‚Äúhow were your holidays‚Äù text either. I feel like this can all be summed up as ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not that into you and you need to move on‚Äù but it really felt like more than that to me. I haven‚Äôt been this down to ride for a girl in so long and she really messed with my head.

Stalking her TikTok reposts revealed to me and my council of advisors that she apparently has an avoidant attachment style, wants to be in a relationship but frequently sabotages connections, and is constantly stressed. My generation seems to really give a fuck about TikTok reposts, so I guess that‚Äôs important info.¬†

I wrote all this a few weeks ago \^ since then, we‚Äôve texted a few times (only after I initiated contact) like nothing has changed. She‚Äôd answer immediately and she even agreed to go sledding with me ‚Äúif she wasn‚Äôt still at home‚Äù (I was back on campus at this point). I followed her on Instagram, too, to which she didn‚Äôt follow me back but still watched my stories? So weird. She‚Äôs also in one of my classes for the spring semester that started this week, but she hasn‚Äôt showed up to either class session. Idk if this is important info but I figured I‚Äôd add it in.

This girl stresses me out and I‚Äôm not sure what attracts me to her so much. Idk what to do, I just wanna love her and hold her the way I did the night we hung out. Any advice?

I (M36) ve been going regularly to an Italian coffee shop. I love the coffee there, and also, it's one of the only places in town I'm allowed to go in with my dog and sit down for a coffee. On weekdays I don't but on weekends I do.

Couple weeks after I adopted the coffee shop last year, man (M-40s) comes in and strikes a conversation with me because of my dog. He doesn't waste time complaining or more like bragging unsolicited that he is in the highest tax bracket and deserve better faster service in our public health system (Canada) because of it. I ask questions, being a nice/polite and he gets a call and just takes it and starts facetiming and leaves me standing there awkwardly before I make a comment he dismisses me by saying he was talking to his son. Isn't the polite thing to do is to apologize and take the call or say something to whoever you started to talk to? Either way I decided he was a disrespectful piece of shit and decided not to interact with him ever.

I figured out in time the staff doesn't like him because he always has phone calls on speaker for everyone to hear and always films people/staff without asking but they'd rather avoid bringing it up. 

Now in my journey of self discovery for my mental health, I realized I was an advocate personally type (MBTI).

Now 10 months later (today) II see him with my dog. Went to my corner without interacting more than I have to. 5 min later, met a friend there that my dog was overjoyed to see. And as my friend was ordering, the guy started talking to someone on speaker making comments and showing my dog.
I called him out on it ""can you not film my dog without asking?"" He started denying he was and I called him out on it. And then a shouting match started and he told me to take my fucking dog out and he was going to complain about me to the owner. I took my coffee outside to avoid escalating and the guy was still goading and telling the person he was talking to on the phone that he won.

Saw the owner outside 10 min later as I was chatting with my friend and told him what happened, he told me not to worry because the guy is an asshole.

Can't help feeling like maybe I should mind my own business. I want to say I don't care about winning or losing but I dislike it when bullies get their way and feel they won, so I do care. And it's eating me from the inside. Meanwhile my dog behaved very well during the entire altercation.

Niche interest wise, I‚Äôd probably be the person who hosts Bachelor watch nights because I love reality TV and I‚Äôm also a massive foodie so I think brunch / cafe‚Äôs / dinners (doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive, just for vibes) is my favorite thing to do. 

we‚Äôre trying to figure out a way to meet tons of nice and chill people and we love hosting people over at our place too. is it true that LA lacks community and it‚Äôs hard to make friends? i‚Äôm really hoping not, so we want to put ourselves out there as much as we can. 

A few questions:
1) which neighborhood should we live in if we want a friendly community feel with folks around our age? 
2) are there activity clubs, cafes, apps etc. that are made for social connections? 

Any insider tips or advice would be awesome. Thank you so much! ",1,1737820547.0,AskLosAngeles,3,0.67,False

Latte has almost no foam,"Somehow when I was first breaking in my KF8, and trying all sorts of different things, I landed on a latte macchiato is my normal drink. My previous normal drink was a very large latte, so quite a bit more milk than coffee. I decided to branch out and made a latte with the default settings. There was almost no foam - the tiny bit of foam there was was translucent and looked almost accidental. I would‚Äôve guessed it was a flat white. It did not resemble the pic on the screen at all. It‚Äôs not a problem with the machine being able to make foam, because it makes great foam with the latte macchiato. I know lattes aren‚Äôt cappuccinos, but they typically have a noticeable amount of foam. Is this anyone else‚Äôs experience? Or is there a drink setting that more closely resembles what I‚Äôm expecting for a latte?

1i9pthe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9pthe/i_agreed_to_babysit_jimmy_and_instantly_began/,I Agreed to Babysit Jimmy and Instantly Began Regret it,"I rang the doorbell twice and waited. I was standing on the front porch of Jimmy‚Äôs house.

His family was relatively new to the neighborhood, having moved in only two months ago. They seemed friendly enough during our brief interactions‚Äîjust your typical suburban American family.

So I wasn‚Äôt too surprised when his mom reached out and asked if I‚Äôd be willing to babysit him for the evening. They were offering $100, which was good money for a 15-year-old in my neck of the woods. It didn‚Äôt take me long to say yes.

I had heard whispers that Jimmy was a bit of a problem child, and truth be told, I‚Äôd never babysat a boy before. But how hard could it be? He was just a little kid, after all.

I was about to find out soon enough.

The door opened, and Jimmy‚Äôs parents greeted me warmly, inviting me inside. They introduced me to their 8-year-old son.

‚ÄúHi, Jimmy. I‚Äôm Kathy. Nice to meet you,‚Äù I said, shaking his hand. He gave me a sheepish smile before retreating to the sofa, where he resumed playing his video game.

Jimmy‚Äôs mom explained that she and her husband were heading to a concert and promised they‚Äôd be back by 10 PM. She assured me that her husband would drop me home when they returned.

She had already prepared dinner for Jimmy and asked me to reheat it in the microwave when needed. She also handed me some cash, suggesting I order whatever I wanted from the local restaurant.

Before leaving, Jimmy‚Äôs dad turned to him and said, ‚ÄúListen, buddy. You‚Äôre going to behave yourself, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we get back, we expect Kathy to have only nice things to say about you. Got it?‚Äù

Jimmy nodded, barely glancing up from his game, and with that, his parents bid us goodbye and headed out for the evening.

Things were quiet for the next twenty minutes. Jimmy continued playing his game while I flipped through a magazine and chatted with my friends on my phone.

I glanced at Jimmy occasionally to keep an eye on him. He'd been well-behaved so far, keeping to himself. A few more minutes passed.

Then, I heard a small thud.

Jimmy had casually tossed his console onto the floor. He stretched his legs onto the coffee table, leaned back into the sofa, and interlocked his fingers behind his head. He was staring at me.

""I'm bored,"" he said.

I smiled and closed my magazine. ""Would you like to watch some TV? Is there any cartoon or anime that you like?""

He twirled his toes and kept staring. ""Dance for me.""

""Excuse me?"" I asked, taken aback.

""Dance. Sing. Do whatever you want."" His lips curled into a smirk. ""Mom and Dad are paying you to be here, right? So go ahead. Entertain me.""

'You arrogant little twerp. Who do you think you are?' I thought to myself. But I couldn‚Äôt say that out loud‚Äîhe was just a kid.

""Jimmy, didn't your parents teach you to be respectful to elders? I don‚Äôt appreciate the way you're talking to me,"" I said firmly. ""If you're bored, I can turn on the TV or read you a story from your favorite book.""

""Boring!"" he groaned, rolling his eyes.

""What would you like to do then? Are you hungry? Shall I heat up the food your mom left for you?"" I asked, trying to remain patient.

He turned to me and grinned. ""Do you have a boyfriend?""

""No,"" I blurted before I could stop myself.

He smirked. ""Ha. Thought as much.""

For the first time, my face flushed with anger. I was trying hard to stay composed. This kid was really getting to me.

Jimmy got up from his seat. ""On second thought, I'm hungry. Let‚Äôs order pizza.""

He picked up the cordless phone and began dialing. I got up, walked over, and took the phone from his hand. ""Your mom gave strict instructions not to order out. You‚Äôll have to eat what she made.""

""No, I won‚Äôt! And you can't force me!"" he shouted, his face turning red.

I pulled out my phone. ""I‚Äôm calling your dad. Your parents won‚Äôt be happy to hear about this.""

Jimmy‚Äôs bravado faded. Realizing the consequences, he mumbled, ""I‚Äôm sorry. I shouldn‚Äôt have done that.""

""It's alright, Jimmy,"" I sighed. ""Are you hungry?""

The little boy thought for a moment and then asked, ‚ÄúIs it ok if I can hug you?‚Äù

‚ÄúPleaseee..‚Äù he said, smiling sweetly with folded hands.

I smiled and nodded. The boy came forward and gave me a warm hug.¬†

And then I suddenly felt a searing pain in my body. Jimmy bit me in the arm and then quickly moved back.¬†

As I stood there rubbing my arm in shock, he came towards me again and this time grabbed my phone. He then ran across the hall, and threw it out the window.

‚ÄúJimmy!!‚Äù I yelled in anger.¬†

I opened the front door and peered outside. The phone landed in the garden, which was populated with all kinds of plants and shrubs. The place was also poorly lit.¬†

I turned back to look at him angrily. ‚ÄúYou better stay put in your place. Or else you will be really sorry‚Äù I warned him. He took the hint and sat back on his chair.¬†

I then went out to search for my phone. I was crouched on all fours, combing the place with my hands in all that darkness, hoping I would somehow find it.¬†

A few moments passed by and then I heard the door slam shut.¬†

I started panicking and rushed back towards the door.¬†

As I got closer to the entrance, I heard a loud voice. It was not Jimmy‚Äôs. It sounded like a much older man. He was inside the house with Jimmy and was yelling at the top of his voice.

‚ÄúWhere is the money boy? Where has your father kept it?‚Äù, he roared

‚ÄúShut up. Stop crying. I am going to smack if you don‚Äôt stop now‚Äù, the man warned.

I could hear Jimmy crying and I began to panic. I started banging on the door. I was really worried about the boy‚Äôs safety.¬†

‚ÄúPlease I don‚Äôt know anything about that‚Äù, I heard Jimmy reply back.¬†

Then I heard something crash to the floor accompanied by the sounds of running footsteps from inside the house.¬†

¬†Jimmy was shouting ‚ÄúHelp. Somebody please help me!!!‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúPlease no‚Ä¶. Leave me ‚Ä¶.please‚Ä¶.Aaaaaaghhh‚Äù

Jimmy was screaming at the top of his voice. Now even I started yelling from the outside while continuing to bang on the door.¬†

‚ÄúJIMMY JIMMY!! ‚Ä¶‚Äù. I cried.

Things suddenly went quiet. But it was only for a fleeting moment.¬†

And then I heard another crash at the back of the house.¬†

I ran back to see what happened. The back door was left open. I slowly tiptoed towards the door and peered inside.

¬†I couldn‚Äôt find anybody. I then rushed indoors towards the living room.¬†

And I saw Jimmy lying on the floor face down ‚Ä¶.in a pool of his own blood!

I ran towards the boy in absolute panic and turned him over.¬†

I could not even figure out if he was dead or unconscious. I couldn‚Äôt even check his pulse because my hands were trembling.¬†

I got up to get to the phone. I dialled the number to call an ambulance.¬†

And then I heard that voice again‚Ä¶.. This time, from behind me. .

‚ÄúI am going to kill you‚Äù, he roared.

¬†I turned back in absolute horror thinking this was going to be the end of me. That this was it. In that moment my whole life flashed before me which made me feel sick to my stomach.

But as I turned I found myself looking at a giant TV screen with a picture of an angry man on it.

Then the picture came to life. The man on the screen started yelling again.¬†

Pause.¬†

He froze.¬†

Play.¬†

‚ÄúI am coming for you‚Äù, he said.¬†

Pause.¬†

He froze again.¬†

With the phone still held to my ear, I slowly turned around to look where I found Jimmy lying on the floor.¬†

He was sitting upright on his knees with a TV remote in his hand, and an evil grin on his face.¬†¬†

The obnoxious brat had been playing me all along.

Everything was fake. The attack, the cries for help,¬† the blood on his T-shirt‚Ä¶ It was all fake!

‚ÄúWhy would you do this to me?‚Äù I asked him, unable to hide my helplessness.¬†

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I saw the film Home Alone with my parents last month. I‚Äôve been simply wanting to try this since then‚Äù he answered back, his lips curling into an evil grin.¬†

I was fighting back tears that were welling up inside me.¬†

But I didn‚Äôt want to give this kid the satisfaction of seeing me break down. The last thing I needed right now was him to start calling me a cry-baby. Deep down,¬† I really really wanted to spank that brat.

Then I heard a knock on the door.

‚ÄúHello there, is everything ok?‚Äù, I heard a voice from the outside.¬†

‚ÄúThis is Dominique, your neighbhor. We heard screams from your home‚Äù he said out loud.

‚ÄúIs everything alright?‚Äù he asked as he continued to knock on the door.

I finally felt a tinge of relief. I have known Uncle Dominique since I was a kid and he was a kind man.¬†

I walked towards the door and opened it.¬†

He was standing with 3 other people. All were looking concerned.¬†

‚ÄúKathy? What are you doing here? What is going on?‚Äù he asked.¬†

Before I could reply, I saw his expression change from confusion to alarm. He just barged into the living room.¬†

When I turned back, I saw Jimmy slumped on the sofa, unconscious with blood stains all over his shirt.¬†

Dominique urgently patted him on the cheek and he remained unresponsive. He then sprinkled some water on his face and the boy slowly started to regain consciousness.¬†

I just stood there dumbstruck, watching the drama continue to unfold in front of me.¬†

‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ Where am I?‚Äù Jimmy asked, trying to look all groggy and confused.¬†

‚ÄúYou are at home, my child. Are you ok? What happened?‚Äù Dominique asked, pointing to his clothes.¬†

I stepped forward to answer, ‚ÄúUncle Dominique, it's all fine . He is just act‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dominique raised his hand and gestured me to keep quiet. He then asked another neighbhor to fetch a doctor who lived two houses away.¬†

Then the screaming started again.¬†

‚ÄúShe ‚Ä¶she ‚Ä¶is a MONSTER‚Äù, Jimmy yelled out loud with his finger pointed at me.¬†

‚ÄúKeep her away from ME‚Ä¶.. Please.. Please. .Please SIR‚Äù, he cried with his eyes closed, heavily leaning into Uncle Dominque with folded hands , almost as if begging him for his protection.¬†

All of them were staring at me now.

I could no longer control my tears. They were just flowing down my face. It was bad enough to be treated shabbily by this kid in private.

¬†But now people who I grew up knowing my entire life, were giving me looks like I was some kind of tyrant.¬†

I just wanted to get back home and hug my parents. I could not take this any longer.¬†

I ran towards the entrance and opened the front door, wide open and was shocked to suddenly see a policeman standing in front of me.

¬†‚ÄòDid the neighbhors complain? Am I going to be arrested?‚Äô, I thought to myself as I struggled to control my pounding heart.

‚ÄúIs this Jimmy's home‚Äù he asked me. I nodded.¬†

‚ÄúAre you the babysitter Kathy?‚Äù he continued. I nodded again.¬†

He then asked, ‚ÄúWhere is Jimmy?‚Äù

I slowly pointed my finger at the future Oscar winner.¬†

And for the first time, I saw genuine fear in his eyes. The little rascal finally realized he had gone too far.¬†¬†

I quickly explained to the officer what happened and it didn‚Äôt take him long to believe me.

The little twerp couldn‚Äôt even look him in the eye.¬†

The officer then told me, ‚ÄúYou both are coming with me to the station.‚Äù

Before I could put in another word, a couple of constables escorted me and Jimmy into the police car.¬†

‚ÄúWhy am I being taken to the station Officer?¬† I have done nothing wrong ‚Äú, I protested.¬†

But I was only met with all round silence.¬†

Fear coursed through my veins once again as I sat in the police car, flanked by a couple of cops on either side, while Jimmy sat silently in the front. I could already picture myself spending the weekend in jail‚Äîcharged with something like child cruelty or abuse, or whatever twisted accusation Jimmy was quietly brewing in his head.

But when we reached the place, I saw his parents in the station as well. And I was shocked to see them locked behind bars. They also looked oddly dressed in full black gear, very different from the classy attire they had worn for the concert.

Then on the table, I saw a shotgun and other semi-automatic weapons wrapped in evidence bags. The realization began to finally dawn on me!

These people were some kind of criminals!!

The officer walked up to me and said, ‚ÄúJimmy's parents have been arrested for trying to rob a diamond merchant. They shot and injured people during the heist. So they will be going to prison for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to sit with the boy until someone from Child Services can come and take care of him. Understood?‚Äù he asked. I nodded silently and glanced across the hall.

He was staring into an abyss and looked lost in his own thoughts.¬†

I could see that he was trying to grapple with the consequences of what was about to happen. His life was going to change completely from now on.¬†

I walked over and sat beside him.

And then gently wrapped my arms around him.¬†

He hugged me back and started crying inconsolably‚Ä¶",1,1737820275.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

Can you help me make a choice in my dilemma: Mazda 3 2015 Petrol or 2012-2013 Petrol?,"So yeah, I guess it's harder to find a car to buy in Germany than I expected. 

Used cars seem to be getting more expensive every dang month. 

I contacted a couple of dealers, and more than half of them didn't even want to reply, ahaha. It's so funny.

Now, the problem I have. My car will be on the street most of the time, and now I am reading about the city I live, even though it's a small car, there are a ton of criminals in it stealing cars, even DAMAGING THEM on purpose while walking next to them, and now I am afraid to buy something more expensive. I am staying in this city for 3 more years TOPS, then I might even change the country if my professional career decides to do so. But i surely need a car to be able to go to visit my pops in the south of the EU from time to time and to use it in my city here. 

So far I was thinking about buying Mazda 3 Skyactiv Petrol. BUT.................!!!!!!!

From what I've seen, it's almost impossible to get an email back from those who are selling them for 8000 euros, up to 9000 even. But, I could buy one for 10 or 11k euros. I find that maybe a bit too expensive now for a car that is like 10-11 years old. Maybe i'm just petty here, but I would feel really bad if my car would be stolen or heavily damaged and I paid for it 11k euros for example. Yeeeeeees, I know, insurance can help here, but you then have a problem finding a car again, can't have the same one, and more problems. 

OR, should get Mazda 3 from 2012 or 2013? Those from 2013 even have a display inside. But it's such a pity that they do not have a USB port inside. I cannot really understand that. I had a car from 2008, and it had such a port, but why they didn't put it in 5 years younger Mazda, I've no idea. But, this kind of Mazda 3 could be bought for 6-7k euros. It's a significant difference. These Mazdas are around 11k euros, 2015 year tops, and for 2k euros more, i could find a Honda Civic 2017 or 2018 O.o I hate these games with numbers sometimes ahaha... 

Mazda 3 2012 or 2013 is Petrol 1.6 engine with 105 HP, while Mazda 3 2014 or 2015 is 2.0 Petrol and 120-125 HP. But, the difference in the price here is like 3-4k euros. Both of these cars have a mileage of around 100k to 150k km. 

In the case of buying this Mazda 3 2012 or 2013, do you think that I would have problems when going on a 1200 km trip in one direction? Even though I would stop a couple of times to grab a coffee or something, wouldn't drive non-stop.

So, any advice here would be very useful to solve my dilemma. :)

I feel a migraine coming on. Headache and nausea are building so it‚Äôs about to be lights off for me.  
  
I wanted to express my absolute most sincere gratitude to the people who have contacted me the last few days. This has been very emotional for me. As I‚Äôve said, I was so torn. I absolutely adore my friend Heif, but I do or maybe now did, care deeply for Reese. I‚Äôve tried to remain neutral. That appears to be a foreign concept to a few people in this space.   
  
I‚Äôm really deeply stung by Reese saying I milk my cancer for views. Perhaps that‚Äôs something she should ask my viewers instead. I don‚Äôt believe I do, but if so I deeply regret it. I like many of her viewers took her words to heart. While I never thought us besties at all, I thought we had a friendship. As evidenced by my writing her. Other than my close friends and one recent email to ASL I don‚Äôt initiate contact. I gladly reply, but I kind of assume people don‚Äôt know who I am.   
  
I have cried over this mess. I‚Äôve prayed, even as Reese says God is on her side, and I‚Äôm an example of why she doesn‚Äôt like people who say they are Christian‚Äôs. Reese is right. God is on her side, just as He is on mine, and everyone reading this, or not. God loves us all. Equally. To believe she or any one person has favor with God is scary and very culty. I am a Christian. I am also a sinner. I try to not be but there are little things I do I am sure I‚Äôll have to account for someday.  But God is not against me and to insinuate that is against every thing I know and believe about God. ‚Äú ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

those two paragraphs about Reese **accusing** her of using cancer!! WTF - How is that moving toward love ‚ù§Ô∏è The Vile, vile selfish creature‚Ä¶. And to **use** God! How dare she?

1i9ppo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1i9ppo4/i_shouted_a_racist_heckle_at_a_basketball_game_10/,"I shouted a racist heckle at a basketball game 10+ years ago, and I think rich donors have been paying people to stalk/harass/use-violence towards me since.","There's a lot here but I think the main part of the story what I did at a basketball game 10+ years ago:

Sometime in the late '00s I was in college at BGSU. At a basketball game at home vs. Akron, when an opposing Akron player was shooting free throws, I yelled out a horribly racist heckle, and recently I figured out that the ripple effects have likely been following my life since. 

**What's the most racist thing you've ever done?**

Think of it. Was it in front of others? People you trust? Are you hoping those people hold on to that secret? Is there video of it? You got your most racist thing? Ok. Mine is yelling ""Go back to Africa!"" at a men's college basketball game while the arena is mostly quiet & the opposing player (who is black) is about to shoot a free throw. It was supposed to be a ""distract the player"" type of thing, but also intertwined with me hating myself and self destructing intrusive thoughts type of thing.

When the words left my mouth I could tell it affected the Akron player. Even someone as socially inept as me knew I did something bad. I looked around at the other students and nobody was looking at me or reacted to what I shouted, or probably they just didn't know how to react. I come off as weird and aloof, so I kinda think people just didn't know how to handle that situation.

Not to make myself the victim, I absolutely did a horrible racist thing and deserved some sort of consequence. But I was also genuinely depressed/suicidal at the time so I try to forgive myself a bit for what happened 10+ years ago. At the time I was actively trying to get people to hate me: being a hurtful person to drive ppl away from me, and at one point yelling a racist heckle at a college basketball game. And yes I sound like a knob when I say this, but I haven't done anything like that before or since that moment. I kinda look back on it as intrusive thoughts and depression colliding in a horrible moment that, yes, was horribly racist and hurtful and embarrassing.

I didn't get the immediate direct hate I was hoping for, but it definitely affected people. I looked back at the players, and it looked like even BGSU's team were negatively affected by what I shouted. They weren't saying anything, but the very next play they basically let the Akron player drive to the hoop & give an emphatic dunk. Even at the time I was really happy that Akron player was able to show off & essentially get back at me for what I shouted. I think I even cheered for him when he did.

I've thought about tracking down the player(s) coach(es) to apologize, but even my psychologist thinks that maybe too much time has passed. Though if any of them are reading this, I do want you to know how sorry and ashamed I am that I did that. It was hurtful and obnoxious and racist and embarrassing for the school and myself. Though nobody has told me details, I know at the time it likely caused a lot of pain & negative feelings for a lot of people in both schools. I'm not 100% sure on the player's name, but I looked up some details on one of them and he had a really rough life at the time. I wish I was in a better state of mind, healthier, more mature, and just not a self destructive person intent on hurting others through myself because I wasn't planning on being around much longer.

And again not to make myself the victim, but I genuinely didn't ever do shit like that. Years later I try to hang on to it being a one time horrible racist decision that definitely hurt people and myself, but ""it's not who I am!"". Yeah yeah I know how I sound.

If you're human at this point you'll probably say ""fuck you, you deserve some sort of consequence"", but I think if you're human you also have to say ""I hope that's never me. Is there a point where all of us can move on? Or is it just attached to you forever? What's the worst thing that should happen to that person?""

**How would you deal with me in that situation? And what would I experience?**

So obviously a lot of people's initial reaction is ""well you deserve to get cancelled I guess... but what happened?"" Firstly - nobody from BGSU talked to me about what happened. I just kinda continued being an asocial isolated weirdo struggling with his mental health trying to earn his teaching degree. Which despite some odd forces fighting against me, I eventually did.

And for over a decade I just kinda lived my life with some odd stuff happening every now and again that prevented me from expanding a social circle, or building a relationship, or succeeding in my career. Some things much more serious than others.

**More Confessions, starting to feel stalked**

The thing that really kicked things into a more serious noticeable state-of-mind was teaching at a school where a former teacher (now attorney) with red flags was consistently in contact with my students via cell phone and in-person meetings. Long story short, in late 2019 a police officer told me this former teacher (now attorney) had an investigation file but the police can't do anything. I ended up reporting him to child services & police for warning signs of grooming & trafficking in early 2020.

During this time period several people (including students) were acting in extremely coached ways. Like, cry on command, in contact with specific adults in concerning ways type of deal. I tried to report what I could, but nothing was technically illegal so all I had was warning signs.

Since dealing with that situation (reporting the attorney to child services & police) I started to feel like I was being stalked/monitored. Long story short - weird van outside my apt, feeling electronic communication is compromised, some friends/family acting uncomfortable with me due to spoof messaging, information I share with my psychologist online seeming compromised, getting my drink spiked at a coffee shop. Pretty common witness intimidation stuff. I don't trust people involved with the legal system.

**Car accidents are common intimidation techniques**

And then sometime in 2021 my older family was supposed to go on a vacation trip, but my parents had to pull out at the last minute due to health issues. While on the trip, there was a car accident and my uncle was killed while my cousin was driving. There was a collision with another car, but I don't know the details. At the time I felt it was a genuine accident.

I didn't know until years later, but the other person involved in the accident ended up suing my cousin and dragging it out for years. Since learning this info I now believe the accident was a planned thing. I don't trust people involved with the legal system.

**There's a lot more I haven't covered**

My two grandpa's died this past summer. Within 2 weeks of each other. Yeah sure, both were old, but I don't trust how quickly it all happened, nor do I trust other things that happened in the midst of it. Elder abuse is a real thing that is unfortunately easy to accomplish if you have enough money. And I'm well aware that I have enemies who have money.

One of the big things I haven't mentioned much is how my technology and life seems monitored. Information you take for granted that is just private things gets leaked out and used against you in bizarre and spoofed ways. I don't have the money to fight against it, so I just live with it now.

**Is there a thread linking everything?**

Recently I've kinda tied everything together that... ""It seems like someone with millions of dollars is stalking and harassing me & friends/family, but who? And why? Oh yeah that time I yelled a racist heckle at the BGSU vs. Akron game. That's probably it. Donors."" People being manipulative & targeting you is much more realistic when you throw enemies with millions of dollars into the mix.

At time of writing this, I'm assuming it's donor(s) related to BGSU athletics, but that's just my guess based on specifics of what happened since. The coaches of both Akron & BGSU had links to the NBA so it feasibly could be anyone connected to the programs.

**Just because you're paranoid, don't mean they're not after you**

If you think I'm paranoid, you're correct. And for well over a decade I thought the same thing. ""It's just you being paranoid, there's no one out to get you"". And then when the whole reporting-a-former-teacher-for-trafficking-links situation happened, I thought it was just him and his little group of con-men related to sex-trafficking. But at this point I think my idiotic racist heckle started the targeting.

There's tons of little details I haven't mentioned that support my theory better. A poor decision that was wildly out of character for me during a moment of mental duress. And yeah, it was racist and horrible and I deserved something happen to me. I wish it didn't happen but it did. I wish I grew up in a different community, but I didn't. 10+ years later I just want to move on, but sometimes I kinda wish I just killed myself like I was planning on doing.",0,1737819997.0,self,5,0.5,False

Professional teeth whitening can transform your smile, giving you a brighter, more confident appearance. However, many patients are unsure about the crucial post-treatment care, particularly when it comes to oral hygiene. Understanding the delicate process of teeth whitening and the proper aftercare is essential to maintaining your brilliant new smile and protecting your investment. The hours and days immediately following a professional whitening treatment require special attention to ensure the best possible results and minimize sensitivity.

Understanding the Teeth Whitening Process

Professional teeth whitening temporarily makes your tooth enamel more porous and sensitive. During the treatment, the whitening agents open up the pores in your teeth, allowing deep stain removal and creating a brighter appearance. This process makes your teeth more vulnerable to staining and potential damage in the immediate aftermath of the procedure.

When to Brush Your Teeth After Whitening

Immediate Post-Whitening Period (First 24 Hours)

Dentists typically recommend waiting at least **24 hours before brushing your teeth** after a professional whitening treatment. During this initial period, your teeth are at their most sensitive and vulnerable. Here's why:

1. Increased enamel porosity
2. Higher risk of staining
3. Enhanced sensitivity to temperature and pressure

Recommended Brushing Techniques

When you do begin brushing after the initial 24-hour period, follow these guidelines:

- Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
- Apply gentle pressure
- Choose a non-abrasive, white-friendly toothpaste
- Brush carefully and delicately

The First Week: Special Care Instructions

During the first week after professional teeth whitening, you'll want to take extra precautions:

White Diet Recommendations
‚Ä¢ Stick to white or clear foods and drinks
‚Ä¢ Avoid colored beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine
‚Ä¢ Choose foods that won't potentially stain your teeth

Potential Sensitivity Considerations

Many patients experience temporary tooth sensitivity after whitening. This is completely normal and typically subsides within a few days. To manage sensitivity:

- Use desensitizing toothpaste
- Avoid extremely hot or cold foods
- Take over-the-counter pain relievers if necessary

A warning before anyone gets too interested in this, I ordered this box over Christmas, it took a month to dispatch, I genuinely thought I had been scammed. It might be a once off, but looking at reviews it's unlikely. These beans are already almost 3 months off roast it might be much more by the time you get them if you try to do the same.

**Cost**

If you wanted this in early December you would have paid ‚Ç¨150, on sale now it's ‚Ç¨75. After tallying up the contents the combined value fresh from the roasters, based on 1/5 the price of 250g retail bags (or equivalent) would be about ‚Ç¨90-95.

**What's in here**

24 numbered 50g pouches of filter roast single origin beans. There's a good spread, 12 different roasters, 10 countries of origin, a wide range of varietals and a mix of washed, natural and experimental processes. The QR codes on the bags point to articles [here](https://www.brewbox.co/blogs/advent-calendar-2024) if you want to look over the coffees

[What's inside](https://preview.redd.it/iwck7yans5fe1.jpg?width=5568&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6dba2bc010dfd1f4e8424636988297d2b90d70b)

**Impression**

There are coffees in here are possibly overstock, they would have been on coffee rosters at the end of summer or beginning of autumn, not all however, there are some which were that roaster's Christmas offering and others which look like roasters putting their best foot forward to try capture a new audience. The only roast date in here is October 31st.

Two roasters in the box are on the current roastful top 100, calender coffee and workshop, and one was previously, girls who grind. The micro roaster of the year Dear Green is in here too and honestly everything else is pretty up there in terms of respected UK and Irish roasters. When it comes to varietals I was surprised to see Geshas and Heirlooms, obviously they don't make up the whole box but I'm impressed to see any.

At half price and used differently to intended this is a crazy good deal. There are some coffees here I'm quite interested to try comparatively, two differently processed beans from Jairo Arcila for example, or the same heirloom beans from different roasters. The bags being numbered but not otherwise labeled really lends itself to that. There's also a few things in here I'm looking forward to trying but would hesitate to buy a full bag of, like a yeast inoculated Indian Chandragiri.

The big concern here is freshness, thankfully everything is light roast but they're still older than you'd like. I pulled two coffees to cup off the bat, a gesha I knew would have a lot of subtleties to lose and a funky ferment I thought might age peculiarly.

The [gesha](https://www.brewbox.co/blogs/advent-calendar-2024/advent-coffee-14) was gorgeous, it hit the tasting notes, super juicy, great fragrance/aroma. I suspect some subtleties were slightly muted and that taste you get from older coffees was just on the edge of perception, not enough to have a negative impact but enough to know these need to be drank now. As a budget way of tasting something new it's still incredibly enjoyable, this was possibly my favourite coffee of the year so far and the 50g went too soon.

The [fermented coffee](https://www.brewbox.co/blogs/advent-calendar-2024/advent-coffee-20?srsltid=AfmBOorNYYQYGXqum3jYEHqgk0V2J5xQR3Gw_u1orQ7MIQ5f8h4N5B4y) smelled and tasted like silage, but fruity. If there was any dulling of flavours here that would be a good thing in my opinion. The predominant tasting note was funk so I guess that tracks, though it might be missing some brightness. I love tasting coffees like this but I do not like this coffee enough to drink a bag of it, or even a second cup. That's a personal taste thing it's clearly a very considered and well processed/roasted coffee it's just experimental and reminds me of a farm. Big win for the calendar/sample box format, great to taste without having to buy loads.

The rest is in the freezer which I think is the only option at this point, the bags are valveless too so it took no effort on my part. Though they are little pillows for sitting so long, they're taking up a lot of space.

**TLDR** This company is absolutely crap at logistics and customer service, to the point I thought I had been scammed and am still wondering if they're going under. Despite this the box they put together was surprisingly good and if you'd gotten it fresh at full price you probably would enjoy it and likely wouldn't feel ripped off. If I had received it shortly after ordering half price would have been a ridiculous steal. Don't gamble on what's left of their stock, but definitely take a look if they're still in business next year.",1,1737819592.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Reading 50 books in a year can be quite demanding yet, of course, possible with the right approach and psyche. First of all, one should clearly set one's goals, make efforts in perseverance towards its fulfillment, and manage to make such reading a part of life.

Want to read more? And¬†is¬†your reading list¬†just¬†growing¬†and growing?¬†Well,¬†it¬†may¬†be time to cross more books¬†off¬†of¬†that¬†list this year than ever.

If you're reading less than you want, you're not alone. One year ago, I looked at my Goodreads page and was taken aback to see that I had read only five books in 2016. That realization frustrated me.

Although I enjoy reading, I have been reading a few books year since I entered college in 2016. I didn't read as much as I would have liked because of my college studies and life.

You¬†have¬†to¬†educate yourself if you want to succeed in this world, and¬†you¬†have to read¬†a lot¬†to do so. Here's how to¬†do¬†it.

¬†

**I am thus based on the key five talking points that follow:**

¬†

**1. Setting a Realistic Goal**

I'd like to read 50 books this year-too, a book a week. A further breakdown could perhaps be that in a year it comes out to be approximately 12 or 13 books a quarter, which sounds ambitious yet does not daunt me. In this case, the big goal starts sounding achievable, and it is this fact that keeps me going.

¬†

*Setting a goal is the first step, but determining if the goal is achievable is what separates the dreamers from the action. It entails connecting your objectives with the steps that will progressively turn them into reality while being aware of your current abilities, resources, and timeline. ‚Äì CHANGALA SAI KIRAN*

¬†

**2. Building the Reading Habit**

I will institute a habit of reading daily at least 30 minutes each and every day, either in the morning, at lunchtime, or before bed. Hook the reading into something you already do over your coffee or as part of your night wind down it is really quite organic.

¬†

**3. Multiple Formats**

I'll make use of multiple formats, mixing and matching those most likely to help me maximize my time reading:

¬∑ Physical **Books:** These are best for focused, distraction-free reading sessions.

¬∑ E**-books**: are easy to read while on the go, whether it be commuting or waiting in a line.

¬∑¬†**Audiobooks**: are great for multitasking during activities such as commuting, exercising, or doing chores. Because of this flexibility, it allowed me to read even on days when things were super busy.

¬†

**4. Choosing Varied and Appealing Books**

Variety makes reading exciting, so I will read across genres and topics, including fiction, non-fiction, memoirs, self-help, and many more. I am going to make sure to select books that are of great interest to me in order for me to be able to keep reading curiously. To maintain the flow, I will also alternate longer and shorter reads.

¬†

**5. Control The growth and Using Resilience**

I'll be accountable for monitoring the books using a journal or apps; this helps me stay organized and allows me to observe my progress in my reads.

I will not stress, force, and move forward with those books that did not stick well with me; rather, I'll shift to the next one. Always, Reading is not a duty; rather, it is something to be enjoyed.

Breaking down the goal into small pieces, easily manageable; consistency, and reading for fun-maybe these are what will help me this year to achieve my goal of 50. Of course, it is not about the number, but all about learning and growth, being submerged in stories and ideas.

If that sounds familiar and somewhat like something you had in mind, let me remind you: be flexible, make time for what you love, and don't forget to celebrate along the way. Let this be a year of great reads!

I had a handful of friends I used to see every few months in my hometown. Me and my GF (30F) moved out of the city back in 2022 to across the country. After moving I deleted all my socials, and haven't talked to my old friends once. I do miss them sometimes and hope they're doing fine, but I cannot reach out to them. I still stay in touch with my mom pretty regularly but not so much my dad, just because his conversations bore me and he's usually trying to lecture me about stupid shit. I don't really talk to anyone at work, because I have no interest in their personal lives or to share mine.

My GF had the same amount or a few more friends than me back in our home town. Since we've moved she's told me she's missed her friends and wants to make friends too but she get shy/awkward so she has trouble. She has made one friend at work since but they rarely hang out now and I see her friend was really putting in a lot of effort into their relationship in the beginning and now seems to have backed off quite a bit. My GF seems fine with it though.

Me on the other hand I'm perfectly content without friends. My gf was asking the other day if it doesn't bother me that I don't have any friends here, and I said i guess it might be nice but I don't even think about. I never thought ""dang I wish i had a friend to share this with"" i usually just share big news with my mom and gf. And will talk/joke with my gf about random shit on my mind. My dad expressed his concerned multiple times and he's pushing me to go make more friends and get on social media. He says at least do it for networking and professional purposes, so I can find better positions in my field. Which I agree with but it's just so damn hard for me care.

I used to want to hang out with friends 24/7 in my teens and early 20s, we'd go smoke weed and do stupid shit. But after I quit smoking, all my friends except few stopped hanging out with me and I never looked back since. I remember when I was little my parents had a way more social life than me, we were constantly going to their friends or having friends over for dinner/coffee, going to events and being way more social than I am currently. But both my parents are really extroverted. My mom's a salesperson and really kind so everyone she meets loves her everywhere she goes. My dad's a consultant, also very social.

So I'm curious if this is concerning or normal with age, just giving less of a shit about having friends and being social?",3,1737819331.0,Adulting,16,1.0,False

1i9pfdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CougarsAndCubs/comments/1i9pfdk/dating/,Dating,"Would love to know what others think of this as a general. 

If a date is planned with a cub and in the midst of conversation the cub says he knows a lot of people where you are meeting up , friends and family, and wants to keep this low-key or discreet, to me that's an automatic deal breaker.

Part of the turn on for me is being with a younger man excited by being out with an older women. If I'm feeling like we have to hide until we get behind closed doors, that feels like being treated like a kink dispenser and it's not something that I'm ok with. Especially if they probably wouldn't do that if on a date with someone their own age. 
This instantly is a no for me. If I'm going on a date with someone i want us to be able to be excited and electrified by the age gap, but at the same time the connection should be about so much more than that, with commonality and chemistry being at the forefront of our connection.

If someone isn't comfortable fully due to anxiety, they need to be direct and upfront about that rather than make a women feel like they desire her but only as a secret.

My last lover was from Reddit a few months ago and our age gap almost 30 years which I know for some here is too extreme. We talked on the phone every night for 7 hours a day. Really liked each other. Our date was super fun with a sleep over but the next morning he wouldn't hold my hand on the way to the train when I was going to work because he didn't want people to see me as a predator. This was shocking to me. Not only was I the more social and engaging of the two of us, but I don't even look my age. Regardless, it felt weird to spend a night going to numerous places on a date, flirting the entire time, holding hands in the dark park, having a sleep over and then drinking coffee with me in bed naked, and still connecting just to have such a weird comment worrying about people's perceptions of us together on our way to the train. 

Just curious as to what people think of all this.

I'm very sensitive to anyone who isn't super proud to be out with me if we plan a date. If they only want to show off a 20 year old yoga bodied young women as a date, they do not deserve my time, especially if they proclaim to be so into older women. ",1,1737819223.0,CougarsAndCubs,1,1.0,False

You all look around confused but the narration continues.. "" The only way to win is to get everyone else around you to say ""I QUIT"""" The last one to not say it wins... refusal to pay results in your termination..."" 

Suddenly the CEO stands up, red in the face and obviously flustered ""ENOUGH! Who's doing this, your fire! I'm gonn..."" but before he could finish his words a bright light flashed and a sound that sounded like a a tunning fork being hit rang out, the CEO began screaming in horror and clawing at his face. He becomes even redder with veins popping from his head, then to the shock of everyone his skins begins to boil. He falls to the ground withering and withen seconds he goes from human, to mush, to nothing. 

  
""as I was saying.."" continued the mysterious narrator ""refusal to play will result in your termination...""

""THE GAME BEGINS NOW!"" the Narrator shouts, with his voice echoing.

Now you reader of Reddit are the main protagonist in this story. To win the game you have to get everyone else to say I quit. There are no rules.  What is your strategy?",1,1737818355.0,hypotheticalsituation,4,1.0,False

# The Caffeine Coordinators: A Prairie Dogging Story

**Who They Are:**  
These are groups of individuals who gather at popular coffee chains, such as Starbucks, not just for caffeine but for the stimulation of digestive processes. They linger close to restrooms, engaging in a peculiar practice: consuming coffee to trigger bowel movements while deliberately holding it in, often for humor, competition, or sheer group solidarity.

**Activities:**

* Consuming large quantities of coffee or fiber-rich snacks as part of their ""ritual.""
* Playfully competing to see who can hold out the longest before succumbing to the call of nature.
* Sharing tips, techniques, and personal ""prairie dogging"" anecdotes in real-time or online forums.
* Using Starbucks as their headquarters due to the coffee‚Äôs well-known laxative effects and the availability of restrooms.

**Impact on Starbucks Policy:** The behavior of such groups could hypothetically lead to disruptions, such as:

* Overcrowded seating areas where members linger for extended periods without making purchases.
* Increased restroom traffic, causing inconvenience to other customers and higher maintenance for staff.
* A shift in the environment, from welcoming to uncomfortable for both customers and employees.

To address these issues, Starbucks might feel compelled to tighten its policies, such as requiring purchases to use the facilities or stay on the premises, as seen with their recent policy changes.",0,1737818345.0,starbucks,4,0.14,False

The anger and anxiety that comes with not putting  one in at the right time or running out with no store in sight. The lack of sleep and most importantly REM sleep. Not feeling refreshed and feeling foggy when waking up until I put in a zyn. Throwing one in right after breakfast. The high resting heart in the high 60s. The dehydration leading to migraines from not drinking enough water. I could keep going and going and I‚Äôm sure you could too. I‚Äôm fucking quitting this shit.

I wrote here about arriving on a 15-50 flight for 6pm at Deutsche Oper.
Redditors here told me my chances were 50/50 and it was 35 minutes plane to train if I was ""not on Ryanair"".

Flight was Ryanair.
Docked at T2 gate B38 at about 15-39/40 ahead of time.
I was in 15D (aisle) and ran across to the front door before anyone else got up.
Noawadays the stairs are stoved beneath the plane and extends automatically, so takes a minute for them to be ready to disembark.

I was first off the plane by far, the terminal was deserted completely and my only challenge was figuring out where to go because all doors were closed -they open automatically when you walk to them but not fast enough if you are running.
Encountered absolutely empty passport control,seemed like ours was the only flight and the second passenger was only turning the corner as I left the desk. 

I took the first door marked Ausgang to get outside, by which time it was 14-43 maybe. and, having seen the map of he airport, I could immediately understand what to run for, so I ran across on the outside and back into the main terminal above where the train was.

caught the S9 at 15-49 - and the only reason to have missed it woukd be me fiddling with the DB app on my phone. It charged me 4.70 but did not issue a ticket, so I had to buy it from the machine anyway, there was no one there either.but I lost about a minute on it all.

looks like I will have about 50 minutes to spare:-)

ps. anyone here as devoted to Verdi as I am? coffee is on me :-)

I (M) went on a few meetups with a girl I met online about 3 years ago (2022) during the late Covid era. 

The first meetup was for coffee which I paid. And then the second was a light lunch which was about the same price as the coffees.

A convo about the vaccine ended our relations (crazy debate üòÖ) but she pretty much disrespected me in the worst way as if my opinions were worthless. And we never spoke again.

That was until about a few days ago when she messaged me on Instagram with her banking info stating that I should pay her back my half of the lunch. Which I think is ridiculous. No ""hey"". No ""hello."" No ""how are you""...just here's my banking info and give me the money, which she didnt even give me to the total to because I dont remember that lunch from 3 years ago ü§£ (until she told me lol)

So...would you pay the money? For me I'm not because I think it's wild that she even had the gall to ask me about that. Nor, have I've ever asked for ex-dates to pay me back their share of money on drinks/food when things didnt work out. Especially not YEARS later.

1i9ox7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i9ox7j/the_phone/,The Phone,"It was an ordinary Tuesday evening. The bus pulled into the stop with a muffled groan, and Rachel stepped aboard, swiping her card with a sense of mechanical habit. The air had the scent of diesel and stale fast food, and the fluorescent lights buzzed a tune that Rachel had long ago learned to ignore. She found an empty seat near the back, a small patch of solace amidst the throng of tired faces and bulging backpacks. The phone sat there, unassuming, nestled in the fabric of the seat. Rachel's eyes flitted over it, pausing briefly before returning to the text message she was crafting. It was a simple black device, no distinctive features to claim it, save for a small crack in the screen.

The bus lurched forward, and Rachel felt the gentle sway of the vehicle's movement as it merged back into the flow of traffic. She sent the message with a sigh, slipping the phone into her pocket. As she stood to get off at her stop, she noticed the abandoned phone again. It was a kind of nuisance, really. Someone was bound to be worried sick. Rachel picked it up, planning to turn it in at the lost and found. A quick check of the contacts might reveal the owner's name, she thought, as she swiped the lock screen. But instead of the typical array of names and numbers, she found a single contact titled ""Home.""

Her thumb hovered over the button. Rachel glanced around the bus. No one seemed to be looking for a lost phone. With a shrug, she tapped the screen. It rang once, twice, and then a man's voice, low and gravelly, answered. ""Hello?"" Rachel's heart skipped a beat. The voice was unfamiliar, and yet, there was something in it that made her skin crawl. She opened her mouth to speak, but the words lodged in her throat. The line went dead. Rachel's eyes widened as she stared at the phone, feeling the weight of something sinister pressing down upon her.

The screen flickered to life. The camera app was open, and the lens stared back at Rachel like a cold, unblinking eye. Her reflection was distorted, stretched into a nightmare version of herself. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. Rachel looked up from the phone, scanning the bus again. Everyone else was absorbed in their own worlds, oblivious to the sudden chill in the air. But Rachel knew she wasn't alone. Someone was watching her through the device. And she had a terrible feeling that she had just become the next chapter in a very twisted story.

Her hands trembled as she powered off the phone. Rachel stepped off the bus into the night, the phone clutched tightly in her hand. The streetlights cast a feeble glow on the wet pavement. Rain pattered against the plastic awning of the bus shelter, the only sound in the eerie silence that had settled over the street. Rachel's apartment was only a five-minute walk away, but it felt like an eternity. With every step, she was aware of the phone's presence, a silent sentinel to a horror she didn't understand.

Once inside her flat, Rachel locked the door behind her and leaned against it, her heart hammering in her chest. She stared at the phone on the kitchen counter, willing it to remain inert. But the screen flickered to life again, the camera eye glaring at her from the darkness of the room. Rachel's breath caught in her throat as the phone vibrated with an incoming message. Her hands shaking, she read the words that had appeared on the screen: ""Keep the phone on. You're the star of the show now."" A cold sweat broke out on her forehead. Her mind raced with scenarios, each more terrifying than the last.

The phone rang again, the shrill sound piercing the quiet. Rachel's eyes darted to the clock. It was almost midnight. The man's voice, now a sinister whisper, filled her ears. ""You've been a naughty girl, Rachel. Pick up the phone. It's showtime."" Rachel's blood ran cold. How did he know her name? Her eyes widened as she realized she had been broadcasting her location, her life, to this monster for hours. The phone's screen went dark, and Rachel's apartment was plunged into silence. But she knew he was watching, waiting for her to make the mistake that would lead her to his twisted game. The night ahead was going to be one she'd never forget.

Her legs felt like jelly as Rachel stumbled to the bedroom, the phone still vibrating in her pocket. She grabbed her own phone, her lifeline to the outside world. The screen remained black, unresponsive. Panic set in. Rachel's thoughts swirled as she searched for a solution. The only person she could think to call was her brother, Jack. He lived across town, but he was ex-military, the toughest person she knew. Surely, he'd know what to do. With trembling fingers, she dialed his number, praying he'd answer.

Jack picked up on the second ring, his voice thick with sleep. Rachel's words tumbled out in a frantic rush, detailing the phone, the voice, the feeling of being watched. She heard him sit up, the rustling of bed sheets in the background. ""Stay put, Rach. Don't touch the phone again. I'm on my way."" His words were firm, reassuring, but the edge of fear in his voice was unmistakable. Rachel nodded, even though he couldn't see her. She didn't know if she could keep the promise. The phone began to vibrate again, a silent, demanding pulse that seemed to grow louder with every second.

Her eyes darted around the room, searching for escape routes, weapons, anything that could protect her. The window was locked, the fire escape a dizzying drop below. Rachel's heart was a drum in her chest, her breath coming in shallow gasps. The vibrations grew more insistent, the phone demanding her attention like a crying child. With a trembling hand, Rachel reached into her pocket and pulled out the black device. The screen was alive with a video call, the camera feed from her own phone playing out the grim tableau of her trapped life. Rachel stared into the void where the man's face should have been, the slits of his eyes gleaming in the dim light of her room. And then she saw it: the reflection of the door handle turning, the soft click of the lock disengaging. He was in her home. The horror of the moment washed over her as the cold, hard reality set in. Rachel was no longer the unsuspecting victim; she was the star of a live-streamed nightmare.

The door creaked open, and Rachel's eyes snapped to the figure in the doorway. He was tall, so tall his head brushed the lintel, his skin the color of bleached bone. His eyes, those slits of malevolence, bore into her soul, and Rachel felt a scream build in her throat. But no sound came. She was frozen, trapped in the headlights of his gaze. The phone in her hand was hot, burning with the weight of his digital presence. And then, with a sickening thud, it was torn from her grip. The psychopath's hand was clad in a glove, the material mottled and stained, a grim reminder of what he was capable of. Rachel's mind raced. She had to get out, had to tell someone, had to live.

But the room spun as the world outside the phone screen invaded her sanctuary. She stumbled backward, tripping over a chair, her vision blurring. Rachel's hand shot out to catch herself, knocking over a lamp in the process. The room was plunged into semi-darkness, the only light coming from the sickly glow of the phone in the madman's grasp. He stepped closer, the silence in the room thick with anticipation. Rachel's eyes searched the floor, her thoughts racing. If she could just get to the kitchen, grab a knife, anything to fight back. But her legs wouldn't obey. The phone was still ringing, the echo of the man's laughter taunting her from the speakers.

The psychopath's eyes narrowed, a twisted smile stretching across his featureless face. Rachel knew she had to act. With a surge of adrenaline, she lunged for the phone, her fingers closing around the cold metal. But he was faster, stronger. He yanked her up by her hair and brought the phone to his slit of a mouth. ""You're mine now,"" he hissed, the sound like the rustle of dry leaves. Rachel felt the sharp sting of pain as the phone was torn from her grip again, the screen lighting up with a new message. ""Welcome to the show."" The words sent a chill down her spine. The game had just begun, and she had no idea what twisted plot he had written for her. Rachel's eyes searched the room desperately, finding the knife block on the kitchen counter, just out of reach. The battle for her life was about to be broadcast to the world.

The psychopath's movements were fluid, eerie, as he approached her with the phone in hand, recording every terrified breath she took. Rachel's thoughts raced, her heart thudded against her ribs like a caged bird fighting to escape. The room grew hot, the air thick with the scent of fear and the faint metallic tang of the rain outside. The door was her only chance. If she could just make it there, she might be able to lock him out. With a sudden burst of speed, Rachel bolted for the exit. But she felt the cold hand of fate close around her arm, wrenching her back into the room, into the clutches of her captor. The phone hovered in front of her face, the video call still streaming, the digital audience eager for the horror to unfold. Rachel's eyes locked onto the camera, and for a moment, she saw not a void, but a sea of faces watching, entranced by the terror playing out in her apartment.

Her scream was a mix of rage and despair as the psychopath flung her onto the couch, the phone hovering just out of reach. The room spun, and Rachel felt the warmth of tears on her cheeks. But she couldn't give in, not yet. Her eyes fell on the TV remote, lying forgotten on the coffee table. It was a flimsy weapon, but it was all she had. With a silent prayer, she lunged for it, her hand closing around the plastic. The psychopath's eyes widened, surprised by her sudden burst of defiance. Rachel brought the remote down with all her might, aiming for the phone. The plastic shattered against his hand, but the phone remained untouched. He howled, the sound inhuman, and Rachel knew she had angered him.

The phone clattered to the floor, the live stream flickering and jumping with the movement. Rachel saw her chance and took it, scrambling away from the monster in the shadows. She could hear Jack's voice on the other line, faint but getting closer. The psychopath loomed over her, his breath hot and sour, the phone now forgotten in his quest to claim her. Rachel's hand closed around the shard of plastic from the remote, the edges sharp and jagged. As he reached for her, she brought it up and dug it into the soft flesh of his hand, feeling the wet warmth of his blood spurt over her fingers. He roared in pain, and Rachel took off, her legs pumping, her heart a wild beast in her chest. The door was just feet away, the promise of escape beckoning. But she knew he'd be right behind her, his long shadow stretching across the room, reaching for her, eager to pull her back into his twisted reality.

Jack's boots thundered up the stairs as Rachel slammed the door shut, the lock giving way with a metallic clang. The psychopath's fist pounded against the wood, the impacts resonating through the apartment like the drums of doom. Rachel's breath came in ragged sobs as she leaned against the barricade she'd created, her eyes searching for a way out. The windows, she had to get to the windows. The sound of shattering glass pierced the night as Jack kicked the front door in, the splinters flying like confetti in the sudden gust of wind. Rachel's eyes met his, and she knew she had to act fast.

The kitchen was a blur as Rachel dashed through it, the knife block her destination. Her hand found the cool steel of a carving knife, and she yanked it free, the sound of the blade slicing through the air echoing through the flat. The psychopath was on the move again, the thump of his heavy boots growing closer. Rachel's heart was a drum, her breathing a symphony of fear. She turned, the knife held in a trembling grip. The psychopath stumbled into the room, his hand a fountain of blood. His eyes locked onto Rachel, and she knew she had to be the one to end this.

Jack burst into the room, his eyes wild, searching for Rachel. Rachel's arm swung up, the knife glinting in the moonlight. ""Get back!"" she screamed, the desperation in her voice raw and primal. The psychopath staggered closer, and Rachel's vision tunneled to the gaping maw of his mouth, the slits of his eyes, and the phone in his hand, still broadcasting to the eager watchers. She could see their faces now, a twisted audience craving the spectacle of her pain. The phone hit the floor again, the screen cracking, the video feed going haywire. Rachel took a deep breath and lunged, the knife slicing through the air like a silver comet. The psychopath's eyes widened, the realization of his fate dawning too late. The blade found its mark, plunging deep into the flesh of his throat. Rachel watched in horror and relief as the light drained from his eyes, his grip on the phone going slack. The line went dead, the screen going black.

The room was silent except for the sound of Rachel's ragged breathing and the distant wail of sirens. Jack was by her side in an instant, his arms wrapping around her, pulling her into the safety of his embrace. Rachel's knees gave out, the adrenaline leaving her as quickly as it had come. They were safe, for now. But she knew the nightmare wasn't over. The digital spectators were out there, waiting for the next unsuspecting victim to become their entertainment. Rachel shuddered, the weight of the world pressing down on her shoulders. She had survived the horror of the slit-eyed stalker, but the scars of that night would never truly heal.

As she stood to get off at her stop, she noticed the abandoned phone again. It was a kind of nuisance, really. Someone was bound to be worried sick. Rachel picked it up, planning to turn it in at the lost and found. A quick check of the contacts might reveal the owner's name, she thought, as she swiped the lock screen. But instead of the typical array of names and numbers, she found a single contact titled ""Home.""

Her thumb hovered over the button. Rachel glanced around the bus. No one seemed to be looking for a lost phone. With a shrug, she tapped the screen. It rang once, twice, and then a man's voice, low and gravelly, answered. ""Hello?"" Rachel's heart skipped a beat. The voice was unfamiliar, and yet, there was something in it that made her skin crawl. She opened her mouth to speak, but the words lodged in her throat. The line went dead. Rachel's eyes widened as she stared at the phone, feeling the weight of something sinister pressing down upon her.

The screen flickered to life. The camera app was open, and the lens stared back at Rachel like a cold, unblinking eye. Her reflection was distorted, stretched into a nightmare version of herself. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. Rachel looked up from the phone, scanning the bus again. Everyone else was absorbed in their own worlds, oblivious to the sudden chill in the air. But Rachel knew she wasn't alone. Someone was watching her through the device. And she had a terrible feeling that she had just become the next chapter in a very twisted story.

Her hands trembled as she powered off the phone. Rachel stepped off the bus into the night, the phone clutched tightly in her hand. The streetlights cast a feeble glow on the wet pavement. Rain pattered against the plastic awning of the bus shelter, the only sound in the eerie silence that had settled over the street. Rachel's apartment was only a five-minute walk away, but it felt like an eternity. With every step, she was aware of the phone's presence, a silent sentinel to a horror she didn't understand.

Once inside her flat, Rachel locked the door behind her and leaned against it, her heart hammering in her chest. She stared at the phone on the kitchen counter, willing it to remain inert. But the screen flickered to life again, the camera eye glaring at her from the darkness of the room. Rachel's breath caught in her throat as the phone vibrated with an incoming message. Her hands shaking, she read the words that had appeared on the screen: ""Keep the phone on. You're the star of the show now."" A cold sweat broke out on her forehead. Her mind raced with scenarios, each more terrifying than the last.

The phone rang again, the shrill sound piercing the quiet. Rachel's eyes darted to the clock. It was almost midnight. The man's voice, now a sinister whisper, filled her ears. ""You've been a naughty girl, Rachel. Pick up the phone. It's showtime."" Rachel's blood ran cold. How did he know her name? Her eyes widened as she realized she had been broadcasting her location, her life, to this monster for hours. The phone's screen went dark, and Rachel's apartment was plunged into silence. But she knew he was watching, waiting for her to make the mistake that would lead her to his twisted game. The night ahead was going to be one she'd never forget.

Her legs felt like jelly as Rachel stumbled to the bedroom, the phone still vibrating in her pocket. She grabbed her own phone, her lifeline to the outside world. The screen remained black, unresponsive. Panic set in. Rachel's thoughts swirled as she searched for a solution. The only person she could think to call was her brother, Jack. He lived across town, but he was ex-military, the toughest person she knew. Surely, he'd know what to do. With trembling fingers, she dialed his number, praying he'd answer.

Jack picked up on the second ring, his voice thick with sleep. Rachel's words tumbled out in a frantic rush, detailing the phone, the voice, the feeling of being watched. She heard him sit up, the rustling of bed sheets in the background. ""Stay put, Rach. Don't touch the phone again. I'm on my way."" His words were firm, reassuring, but the edge of fear in his voice was unmistakable. Rachel nodded, even though he couldn't see her. She didn't know if she could keep the promise. The phone began to vibrate again, a silent, demanding pulse that seemed to grow louder with every second.

Her eyes darted around the room, searching for escape routes, weapons, anything that could protect her. The window was locked, the fire escape a dizzying drop below. Rachel's heart was a drum in her chest, her breath coming in shallow gasps. The vibrations grew more insistent, the phone demanding her attention like a crying child. With a trembling hand, Rachel reached into her pocket and pulled out the black device. The screen was alive with a video call, the camera feed from her own phone playing out the grim tableau of her trapped life. Rachel stared into the void where the man's face should have been, the slits of his eyes gleaming in the dim light of her room. And then she saw it: the reflection of the door handle turning, the soft click of the lock disengaging. He was in her home. The horror of the moment washed over her as the cold, hard reality set in. Rachel was no longer the unsuspecting victim; she was the star of a live-streamed nightmare.

The door creaked open, and Rachel's eyes snapped to the figure in the doorway. He was tall, so tall his head brushed the lintel, his skin the color of bleached bone. His eyes, those slits of malevolence, bore into her soul, and Rachel felt a scream build in her throat. But no sound came. She was frozen, trapped in the headlights of his gaze. The phone in her hand was hot, burning with the weight of his digital presence. And then, with a sickening thud, it was torn from her grip. The psychopath's hand was clad in a glove, the material mottled and stained, a grim reminder of what he was capable of. Rachel's mind raced. She had to get out, had to tell someone, had to live.

But the room spun as the world outside the phone screen invaded her sanctuary. She stumbled backward, tripping over a chair, her vision blurring. Rachel's hand shot out to catch herself, knocking over a lamp in the process. The room was plunged into semi-darkness, the only light coming from the sickly glow of the phone in the madman's grasp. He stepped closer, the silence in the room thick with anticipation. Rachel's eyes searched the floor, her thoughts racing. If she could just get to the kitchen, grab a knife, anything to fight back. But her legs wouldn't obey. The phone was still ringing, the echo of the man's laughter taunting her from the speakers.

The psychopath's eyes narrowed, a twisted smile stretching across his featureless face. Rachel knew she had to act. With a surge of adrenaline, she lunged for the phone, her fingers closing around the cold metal. But he was faster, stronger. He yanked her up by her hair and brought the phone to his slit of a mouth. ""You're mine now,"" he hissed, the sound like the rustle of dry leaves. Rachel felt the sharp sting of pain as the phone was torn from her grip again, the screen lighting up with a new message. ""Welcome to the show."" The words sent a chill down her spine. The game had just begun, and she had no idea what twisted plot he had written for her. Rachel's eyes searched the room desperately, finding the knife block on the kitchen counter, just out of reach. The battle for her life was about to be broadcast to the world.

The psychopath's movements were fluid, eerie, as he approached her with the phone in hand, recording every terrified breath she took. Rachel's thoughts raced, her heart thudded against her ribs like a caged bird fighting to escape. The room grew hot, the air thick with the scent of fear and the faint metallic tang of the rain outside. The door was her only chance. If she could just make it there, she might be able to lock him out. With a sudden burst of speed, Rachel bolted for the exit. But she felt the cold hand of fate close around her arm, wrenching her back into the room, into the clutches of her captor. The phone hovered in front of her face, the video call still streaming, the digital audience eager for the horror to unfold. Rachel's eyes locked onto the camera, and for a moment, she saw not a void, but a sea of faces watching, entranced by the terror playing out in her apartment.

Her scream was a mix of rage and despair as the psychopath flung her onto the couch, the phone hovering just out of reach. The room spun, and Rachel felt the warmth of tears on her cheeks. But she couldn't give in, not yet. Her eyes fell on the TV remote, lying forgotten on the coffee table. It was a flimsy weapon, but it was all she had. With a silent prayer, she lunged for it, her hand closing around the plastic. The psychopath's eyes widened, surprised by her sudden burst of defiance. Rachel brought the remote down with all her might, aiming for the phone. The plastic shattered against his hand, but the phone remained untouched. He howled, the sound inhuman, and Rachel knew she had angered him.

The phone clattered to the floor, the live stream flickering and jumping with the movement. Rachel saw her chance and took it, scrambling away from the monster in the shadows. She could hear Jack's voice on the other line, faint but getting closer. The psychopath loomed over her, his breath hot and sour, the phone now forgotten in his quest to claim her. Rachel's hand closed around the shard of plastic from the remote, the edges sharp and jagged. As he reached for her, she brought it up and dug it into the soft flesh of his hand, feeling the wet warmth of his blood spurt over her fingers. He roared in pain, and Rachel took off, her legs pumping, her heart a wild beast in her chest. The door was just feet away, the promise of escape beckoning. But she knew he'd be right behind her, his long shadow stretching across the room, reaching for her, eager to pull her back into his twisted reality.

Jack's boots thundered up the stairs as Rachel slammed the door shut, the lock giving way with a metallic clang. The psychopath's fist pounded against the wood, the impacts resonating through the apartment like the drums of doom. Rachel's breath came in ragged sobs as she leaned against the barricade she'd created, her eyes searching for a way out. The windows, she had to get to the windows. The sound of shattering glass pierced the night as Jack kicked the front door in, the splinters flying like confetti in the sudden gust of wind. Rachel's eyes met his, and she knew she had to act fast.

The kitchen was a blur as Rachel dashed through it, the knife block her destination. Her hand found the cool steel of a carving knife, and she yanked it free, the sound of the blade slicing through the air echoing through the flat. The psychopath was on the move again, the thump of his heavy boots growing closer. Rachel's heart was a drum, her breathing a symphony of fear. She turned, the knife held in a trembling grip. The psychopath stumbled into the room, his hand a fountain of blood. His eyes locked onto Rachel, and she knew she had to be the one to end this.

Jack burst into the room, his eyes wild, searching for Rachel. Rachel's arm swung up, the knife glinting in the moonlight. ""Get back!"" she screamed, the desperation in her voice raw and primal. The psychopath staggered closer, and Rachel's vision tunneled to the gaping maw of his mouth, the slits of his eyes, and the phone in his hand, still broadcasting to the eager watchers. She could see their faces now, a twisted audience craving the spectacle of her pain. The phone hit the floor again, the screen cracking, the video feed going haywire. Rachel took a deep breath and lunged, the knife slicing through the air like a silver comet. The psychopath's eyes widened, the realization of his fate dawning too late. The blade found its mark, plunging deep into the flesh of his throat. Rachel watched in horror and relief as the light drained from his eyes, his grip on the phone going slack. The line went dead, the screen going black.

The room was silent except for the sound of Rachel's ragged breathing and the distant wail of sirens. Jack was by her side in an instant, his arms wrapping around her, pulling her into the safety of his embrace. Rachel's knees gave out, the adrenaline leaving her as quickly as it had come. They were safe, for now. But she knew the nightmare wasn't over. The digital spectators were out there, waiting for the next unsuspecting victim to become their entertainment. Rachel shuddered, the weight of the world pressing down on her shoulders. She had survived the horror of the slit-eyed stalker, but the scars of that night would never truly heal.

ASP showed us that not everyone turns out to be a famous rockstar or end up with the perfect guy.

Dave was a great boyfriend and it was a shame that they broke up however, once again, it was realistic. People often break up when going to college, even the strongest relationships fall apart.

Compared to Dave, Zach isn't that great though he still loved and cared for Lane. He mightier been scruffy or Grumpy at times but he was there and always showed up for Lane.

Lane working at the diner is really common. I mean a young adults working at a coffee shop, could it be any more realistic? 

The band wasn't famous. Most aren't. Not a big deal. A band started in a garage doesn't always tend to get that big. However, they did have a quite a few gigs and it was still pretty cool.

As per getting pregnant, a lot of the time unplanned pregnancies happen, most of the time twin pregnancies are very shocking but they aren't that rare. While she wasn't thrilled, it could've been worse. She could've been a teenager or unmarried.

Also in AYITL, Lane didn't have a lit going on though she seemed GENUINELY HAPPY and that is what most people don't get. She didn't need any drama because she already had that part of her life planned. Work at a job getting a good amount of pay, grow old with your husband who you love with your life and watch your children grow up.

While Lane's story wasn't at all satisfactory, it was realistic and it sent a message that sometimes you can't end up like Rory Gilmore, sometimes you end up like Lane Kim.",10,1737817572.0,GilmoreGirls,8,0.78,False

1i9oszl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1i9oszl/i_stumbled_for_the_first_time_yesterday_but_was/,"I stumbled for the first time yesterday, but was able to mostly rectify it","I started my no buy on December 27 last year, and I was surprised to find I was having less issues than I expected until... yesterday. To give some context, I have quite a few whys for my no buy, but the primary one is that I don't want to bring more shit into my house. I'm over it; it stresses me out, and I don't need as much as I buy.

So this week, I finally got around to scheduling a hair cut (green light purchase). It's been a long time since I've had one as my previous stylist left the area, and I was majorly procrastinating on finding another. The appointment time potentially conflicted with my husband's dentist appointment, so he dropped me off in the area so I could work at the library up until my hair appointment. Well, the library opened 30 minutes later than expected, I was supposed to be working (WFH), and it was 28 degrees outside. I ended up working for the first hour at a local coffee shop instead, where I bought a coffee and a bagel (yellow light purchase). I was annoyed, but it's not something I do very often (even before the no buy) and it wasn't actually against my rules, but still -- not money I was expecting to spend!

Then I went to the hair appointment, and I totally got convinced into buying a leave-in conditioner. Now, hair care products are not specifically called out on my red light purchases because I don't typically buy them. I have two products currently: a heat protector (for the very rare occasions I use heat on my hair) and a detangler that I just restocked but hadn't opened. The leave-in conditioner works as a detangler, so I figured I would simply return the detangler and have the leave-in conditioner be my replacement item instead. Replacements are yellow light items on my list (essentially, I need to really consider whether I want to continue using that type of item before restocking).

This might sound all well and good but... I thought of zero of these justifications at the time of purchase. It was 100% an impulse buy at the time. I was very frustrated by the time I got home, and even though I reasoned myself up to it being a yellow light purchase, it still didn't feel right to me. I was talking to a coworker and jokingly asked if she would like my unopened detangler. She asked what the ingredients were and had me download an app called Yuka which grades products based on their ingredients.

Y'all... my detangler ranked 2/100 and this new leave-in conditioner was 27/100!!! Thankfully, my husband was very kind and went with me to awkwardly return the conditioner, and the detangler was still in the return window as well. I found a better alternative product to both, but I'm letting myself cool off so I don't buy THAT impulsively as well.

... but after returning the conditioner, my husband and I got a burger and beer at a local bar (yellow light purchase again but ahhhhhhhh). 

Needless to say, yesterday was a mess, and I learned a lot. 1) I feel pressured in situations where someone is recommending a product to me, and I need to create space and research that product if I do in fact think it's a good purchase; 2) I would like more planning to go into meals out. The first meal was truly circumstantial, but the second could have been more planned. 

Anyway, just thought I would share. Any other recommendations or thoughts on how to curb these sorts of purchases would be appreciated!

1i9osst,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1i9osst/28f_why_do_people_tend_to_stick_to_their_toxic/,(28F) Why do people tend to stick to their toxic relationships?,"I just want to understand what makes them stay knowing that their partner is not worth it. For context I was in a serious relationship with a guy and we broke up in 2020 due to misunderstandings and long distance due to lockdown. I was the one who broke up but then I found out while stalking that it was 4 months of my breakup but he was celebrating 6 months of his new relationship with his office colleague lol. I eventually forgave him but went no contact.

Now few weeks before I stumbled upon my ex into a mall totally out of blue. I heard from my common friends that he also broke up with that girl and now into his 3rd relationship since he met me and they are planning to marry. Now I am totally moved on and really don't care so wanted to leave but he insisted to get a coffee together so I agreed. 

We had normal talks about life in past 5 years and he laughed about how I blocked him so I unblocked him because of my people pleasing traits. I am currently single and I pretended to ask him and to my surprise he told he is also single. He literally lied which I didn't liked so I told I have some urgent work and left. 

He started sending me reels on insta and sent me a romantic song reel which was our song when we were together. I asked him what the hell is this and I know that he is committed then he told he doesn't like her and he is stuck and cannot get out, she got fat with time and he doesn't feel attracted. I told him it's not my problem and told that I am not interested.

I know I should not meddle but from his following I found his current girlfriend ID and DMed her chat screenshot on instagram where he is clearly demeaning her and telling me to get back together but she left me on seen. 

I also moved on in my life, blocked my ex again but today through common friends I got to know that their parents are meeting next month and planning wedding. This girl is having so much low self esteem that even after seeing DMs she did not care and even planning to marry this type of guy.

What makes people stay in such relationships I would never understand.",5,1737817436.0,RelationshipIndia,7,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:¬†\
https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
- Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

# Pour #1 (00:00 - 01:00)

1. **Switch closed.**
2. Bloom until the water covers all coffee particles (around **3x coffee weight**, 45ml in our case).
3. Give it a swirl.

# Pour #2 (01:00)

1. **At 01:00 open the switch** and pour water until it reaches **100ml**.
   * The average pouring speed should be **5-7 gr per sec**.
   * Use circular motions but don't get too close to the walls. Also, pour some amount right into the center.
2. Let the water draw down until it barely covers the coffee grounds.
   * Don‚Äôt let the water fully draw down before starting the next pour.

# Pour #3 (timing depends on coffee)

1. As soon as the water level gets close to the top of the coffee grounds, pour until it reaches **150ml**.
   * Use the same pouring technique as before.
2. Let the water draw down until the timer hits **02:00**.
3. Close the switch at **02:00**.

# Pour #4 (02:00)

1. **Switch closed.**
2. Pour the remaining water to reach **240ml**.
3. Open the switch at **02:45**.

# Expected drawdown time: 03:20 to 03:40. To achieve the desired drawdown time you can tweak the time when you open the switch after the final pour.

1i9on1x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9on1x,Looking for help with texture and tiny wrinkles,"

Hello! Looking for help with the texture and tiny wrinkles on my face. I started noticing this like 6 years ago and sadly never had the money for products or to get treatments or the time/brain bandwidth to research. 

Now I‚Äôm six years older and my life is more stable, I can tackle this issue that has gotten worse as I age. Is it normal aging? I feel it is not. 

I am mostly concerned about the tiny wrinkles I have. I cannot wear powder foundation anymore as it exacerbates their visibility. I have never done Botox or any treatments but everything I read says Botox is for like smile lines or forehead lines etc, where these are tiny little wrinkles in my cheeks and forehead. I cannot wear powder raise my eyebrows and have 2 very tiny visible lines across my forehead. I am grateful for that at 38 but I am very bummed about the texture and tiny wrinkles that have taken over my cheeks.

Any help is greatly appreciated. I use dermalogica face wash and daily exfoliant for a long time. I started tretinoin a few weeks ago for acne and it has done wonders for my skin clearing up. I also use la roche cica balm 5 all over my face as a moisturizer and then I also put dermologica moisturizer over it because my skin feels so dry most of the time. 

I drink water regularly but maybe not enough? I aim for 100 oz a day but some days definitely only make it to 50 oz. I will get better at water consumption. I don‚Äôt drink soda, coffee, drink etc. I eat a healthy diet and exercise 3 x a week. 

Please tell me what products or treatments I should consider. Trying to avoid painful lasers as much as possible. ",0,1737816991.0,30PlusSkinCare,3,0.4,False

1i9om7p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9om7p,Did I hit the wall in my 25km run? Is a 3:30 FM still possible? Worried after a bad longrun,"Hey everyone. Had a 25km long run in my homebrew 11 weeks block ahead of a marathon at the end of February, training to break 3:30. This one was bad. Around halfway I started feeling nauseated, and towards the last few KMs my legs were so heavy. I couldn't hit my target pace of 4:55/km anymore, which is normally not that difficult for me. For comparison, last week's longrun of 23km, I hit 4:51 average at 159 avg hr, and the previous week was 20km @ 4:56, 163 avg hr. Admittedly, the pace and avg hr stats for this run don't look that bad for me but it was a struggle from about km 13 which is rarely the issue for me so it left me a bit worried.

There were a few things different in this run - I had only 2 gels (km 8, km 17), both are caffeniated. I had no breakfast before that other than coffee. I woke up late so it was only 30 mins from waking up to out and running. 

Did I hit the wall at km 22? I always thought the wall is only at around km 30-32. Or was it just a ""bad"" run? Most importantly, should I worry I might not hit my goal pace with 5 weeks to go?",8,1737816923.0,Marathon_Training,22,0.83,False

1i9okha,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9okha,The Wabi-Sabi DJ homage,"I tried for the first time to do an ¬´aged¬ª tropical dial. It didn‚Äôt turned out quite like what I hoped for, the final product became a bit too ¬´distressed¬ª for my taste. It was regardless a good experience. 

I thought I‚Äôd share how I did it in case someone would like to take a swing at it.

First of all, I‚Äôll say the coffee ground + oven bake method does not work for a silver sunburst dial. It only cause minimal dyeing, ugly stains and specks of coffee ground getting stuck on the dial. I do not recommend this method.

What I did after many many rounds of experimenting dyeing the dial with coffee, is to mix very dark coffee with ¬´Vallejo ultra matte polyurethane varnish¬ª. Spread the mixture on top of the dial but make sure the liquid stays on by surface tension and don‚Äôt let it spill down the date hole or the dial hole. Also it‚Äôs super important that the dial stays completely flat.

Use a toothpick and move around the tiny specks of concentrated coffee to where you desire it to be when it dries on the dial. However you cannot avoid a concentration of coffee on the raised indices as the mixture dries. 

Once it dried, I used a small amount of yellow/tan pigment and gently patted on dial to reduce the glossy finish made by the varnish.

As for the hands, I re-lumed the originally white lume. I removed the original lume by soaking the hands in acetone and then scraped it off.
I made a new mixture of lume material, mixing white/turquise lume pigment with the tan pigment mentioned earlier. I think this turned out great. Obviously the actual lume is quite dim due to the mixture of non-luminous pigment. I purposely did not wipe down the hands in order to keep the smudges for the vintage look. I also brushed a minuscule amount of tan pigment on the finished hands to give it a dusty look.

That‚Äôs pretty much it! I hope this helps whoever is planning on a similar build, because when I started on this project, I could not find a single tip that worked for this particular dial.

Yesterday, I spent about $700 on computer parts. I'm building a NAS. I needed some hard drives, RAM and stuff.

As I walked home from Canada Computers, I noticed a person covered in blankets outside the Shoppers. I felt terrible, but I didn't want to disturb them and, frankly, felt a little intimidated.

So I kept walking.

Half a block later, I ran into another unhoused person. They were asking for change - I had none, having spent the last of it on egg buns from the Vietnamese baker on the way to Canada Computers. 

But they were right outside a branch of my bank - and fuck sakes, I had just dropped $700 on storage for movies. I can't give some person having a deeply shitty time a single cent?

I went in, I withdrew about $50, and I gave it to them. Of course, they were very happy - I'm not trying to brag here (I'm fortunate enough to be able to afford it, and I recognize most can't right now), I just want to put in context what happens next.

---

We get to chatting. this person explained how they ended up here - a crippling workplace injury that, thankfully, our overburdened healthcare system correctly identified as life threatening, and saved them from a life of being paralyzed. They started recovery, and they said things seemed to be getting better.

Then, they ran out of savings.

They had to go back to work to pay rent and put food on the table for their kids.

They went back too early.

The steel rod they had put in bent. The pain was completely fucking unbearable - completely unending back pain and nerve pain all down lower body. They asked me to feel the rod sticking two centimeters out from their back.

They got on ODSP, and promptly could no longer cover rent (since it's only about $500/mo). ODB doesn't cover their (very strong) pain meds, so they have to cover them out of pocket from the ODSP payments.

Last month, they got mugged. They lost the half of their monthly ODSP payment.

At this point, I, a 27 year old, 6'4"", 230 pound grown man was about to burst into fucking tears on the sidewalk next to this guy. I've also struggled with sciatica and know how debilitating the pain can be - and this is maybe one tenth of what this person deals with daily.

---

Then, they ask me for a coffee. I'll pay, they say, I just can't stand walking over there. They give me four bucks out of their coffee cup (let me reiterate, I JUST GAVE this person around $50) and absolutely insists I take it.

Then, something amazing happened. 

Two guys, early 20s, walk by. One of them is holding his lunch, a coffee from Tim Hortons and a sandwich. They see the two of us sitting on this piece of shitty cardboard and, without a word, hand the person their lunch, smile and turn around back to the Tim Hortons.

The unhoused person is incredibly grateful. I'm shellshocked. With relief, they dig in.

That's the story I wanted to tell.

This person doesn't have a phone, so I'm resetting my old Pixel 6 to give to them. Again - not bragging here. I just hope that, walking down Bank if you have the time, consider stopping for a chat to see if there's anything easy you can do for them. I don't need my old phone with a fucked up screen I haven't used in three years, but for them it meant access to services, easier times with doctors appointments, and a simpler way to communicate with others.

I recognize this can be intimidating for some - women especially, so don't feel obligated, and if you get a bad vibe, it's okay not to. But these sorts of simple, human interactions with strangers are something folks starve for - or at least, this person did.

There's many things you can do and wonder if you did the right thing. Maybe this guy scammed me out of $50, and will scam me out of a phone. But you know what's unequivocally good? Feeding people. And fuck man, that shit feels good too!

We're headed into truly tough times politically and economically. Even if interacting with the unhoused is a no-go for you (which is fine!), work on helping each other. Build support networks - even with your well-off neighbours, or reinforce support networks in your friend group.

Fundamentally, this person didn't have a support network strong enough to deal with the brutal injury they received. The state failed them, and they ended up on the street. Maybe, by building those support networks, we can help every now and then in keeping people out of dangerous situations like this.

The decision by Amazon to close seven of its stations in Quebec is more than an economic blow‚Äîit is a looming catastrophe that threatens to push Quebec into a financial crisis. With the immediate loss of over 5,450 jobs and devastating ripple effects across industries, Quebec‚Äôs economy faces a downward spiral that could trigger widespread instability in the coming months. If left unaddressed, this event may signal the beginning of a financial collapse in the province.

This is not just a wake-up call‚Äîit is an emergency. Without immediate and aggressive intervention from all levels of government, Quebec‚Äôs economy could enter a period of prolonged recession, dragging Canada‚Äôs overall economic health along with it.

An Unprecedented Economic Collapse in the Making

Amazon‚Äôs abrupt exit from Quebec brings with it a chain reaction of devastating consequences:

The Job Market Implosion
	‚Ä¢	Total Jobs Lost Now:
	‚Ä¢	1,700 direct Amazon employees.
	‚Ä¢	3,750 employees from 25 DSPs (Delivery Service Providers), small businesses contracted to Amazon.
	‚Ä¢	Over 5,450 immediate job losses across the province.
	‚Ä¢	Ripple Effect on Families:
	‚Ä¢	These employees support an average of four dependents each, meaning nearly 40,000 lives will be disrupted overnight, leading to financial instability and emotional distress.
	‚Ä¢	Unemployment Surge:
	‚Ä¢	The provincial government will face an avalanche of unemployment claims, adding massive strain to social safety nets.

Loss of Economic Lifeblood
	‚Ä¢	Vanishing Salaries:
	‚Ä¢	DSP employees earning $24/hour collectively contribute $175‚Äì250 million in annual wages. This critical stream of income for thousands of households will vanish instantly.
	‚Ä¢	Tax Revenue Disaster:
	‚Ä¢	DSP operations alone contribute $62.5 million in annual taxes to the provincial government. This revenue will evaporate, leaving a gaping hole in Quebec‚Äôs budget.

Collapse of Small Businesses
	‚Ä¢	Impact on Local Ecosystem:
	‚Ä¢	Over 1,200 vans used by DSPs will no longer need maintenance, forcing closures of garages, tire suppliers, and car washing businesses.
	‚Ä¢	Uniform suppliers, coffee shops, and local food outlets that rely on daily purchases from DSP employees will lose tens of thousands of dollars in daily revenue.
	‚Ä¢	Widespread Closures:
	‚Ä¢	The shockwaves will ripple through Quebec‚Äôs network of small businesses, triggering a wave of bankruptcies and job losses that will deepen the economic crisis.

A Warning of Impending Financial Ruin

Amazon‚Äôs departure is more than just a current economic setback‚Äîit signals the collapse of Quebec‚Äôs future growth potential, threatening to cripple the province‚Äôs economy for years to come.

Future Growth Wiped Out
	‚Ä¢	Missed Opportunities:
	‚Ä¢	Amazon was on track to expand operations across Quebec, with plans to create 25,000‚Äì30,000 jobs over the next decade. This growth, which could have revitalized Quebec‚Äôs economy, has been erased.
	‚Ä¢	Lost Global Investments:
	‚Ä¢	Amazon‚Äôs decision sends a chilling message to international investors that Quebec is no longer a viable destination for large-scale operations, further eroding the province‚Äôs economic prospects.
	‚Ä¢	Canada‚Äôs Reputation at Risk:
	‚Ä¢	The fallout from Amazon‚Äôs closure jeopardizes Canada‚Äôs standing as a reliable market for global companies, deterring future investments across the country.

A Call to Action: Prevent Quebec‚Äôs Collapse

The Governments of Quebec and Canada must take immediate, decisive action to prevent the economic disaster that is now unfolding. This includes:
	1.	Emergency Negotiations: Open high-level talks with Amazon to renegotiate terms and keep operations in Quebec.
	2.	Incentives to Stay: Provide tax relief, infrastructure support, and operational subsidies to secure Amazon‚Äôs long-term presence.
	3.	Pro-Business Reforms: Remove regulatory roadblocks and create a more attractive business environment to retain and attract global players.
	4.	Economic Safeguards: Develop emergency measures to support displaced workers and stabilize small businesses impacted by Amazon‚Äôs departure.

The Cost of Doing Nothing: Total Financial Collapse

If no action is taken, Quebec‚Äôs economy will face a devastating chain reaction:
	‚Ä¢	Half a Billion Dollars in Annual Losses: With wages, taxes, and business revenues wiped out, Quebec could lose over $500 million annually, leaving the government unable to meet budgetary commitments.
	‚Ä¢	Skyrocketing Unemployment: Thousands of skilled and entry-level workers will be left without jobs, creating unprecedented strain on unemployment programs and social assistance systems.
	‚Ä¢	Decline in Living Standards: Families will face housing insecurity, rising debt levels, and diminished access to essential services.
	‚Ä¢	Loss of Global Competitiveness: Quebec‚Äôs and Canada‚Äôs reputations as stable economies will be permanently damaged, driving away other potential investors.

An Urgent National Crisis

This is not just a Quebec issue‚Äîit is a Canadian crisis. Without urgent government intervention, the repercussions will ripple across the entire nation, leading to economic destabilization on a scale never seen before.

Quebec‚Äôs economic future‚Äîand by extension, Canada‚Äôs‚Äîis hanging by a thread. The time to act is not tomorrow, not next week, but today. Policymakers at every level must mobilize to reverse Amazon‚Äôs decision and secure the province‚Äôs financial stability before it‚Äôs too late.

Yesterday I was in a coffee shop with about 20 other women and we were all mostly reading/studying individually. Upon looking at the room I noticed I found everyone exceptionally pretty, which to me is so rare. For context I am also a woman and not single. 

I‚Äôve been taking antidepressant medication for anxiety and depression for about a month (Bupropion). I used to have this problem of being physically repulsed by people‚Äôs faces and their expressions when I went outside the house. This used to be exacerbated by lack of sleep. Now I find that people look normal/nicer to me. Yesterday I was quite paranoid at first. 

Today I find myself in a public space again and everyone looks anywhere from a normal Joe to fairly attractive to me. Is this normal? Do people who don‚Äôt have depression experience the beauty of other people on a daily basis? 

All I could find online was that Bupropion use is related to (hyper?) sexual dysfunction in women  and while I don‚Äôt believe I experienced any thoughts of that nature when looking at strangers, I‚Äôm trying to think of ways in which this could be correlated.

1i9oax5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFitStories/comments/1i9oax5/how_my_friend_mark_transformed_his_life_with_the/,How My Friend Mark Transformed His Life with The Pineal Guardian,"Hey Reddit! I wanted to share an incredible story about my friend Mark (he‚Äôs 42 and lives in Austin, TX). Mark is one of those people who always seemed full of life‚Äîuntil a few years ago when things started to change. His energy dwindled, his focus became scattered, and he always talked about feeling like he was living in a constant fog.

I remember catching up with him over coffee last November. He admitted that he felt stuck, like he was just going through the motions of life. He had tried so many things‚Äîmeditation, nootropics, even some intense detox diets‚Äîbut nothing seemed to give him lasting results.

That‚Äôs when he came across something called The Pineal Guardian during a late-night internet search. Mark said he wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but the concept of detoxifying the pineal gland caught his attention. He‚Äôd never even heard of the pineal gland before, so he dug into the science behind it. Turns out, this tiny gland deep in our brain plays a huge role in regulating sleep, cognitive function, and even emotional balance.

**The First Few Weeks: Small Changes Add Up**

Mark ordered the product in early December and started taking it daily. At first, he didn‚Äôt notice much‚Äîjust a slightly better mood here and there. But by the second week, things started to shift. He said waking up in the morning wasn‚Äôt such a battle anymore. Instead of hitting snooze five times, he actually felt rested and ready to start the day.

By the third week, Mark described this amazing sense of mental clarity. He called me one evening and said, ‚ÄúDude, it feels like someone cleared all the tabs in my brain. I can focus again!‚Äù His creativity also came flooding back‚Äîhe‚Äôs a freelance graphic designer, and he told me he hadn‚Äôt felt this inspired in years.

**A Moment of Real Transformation**

The real breakthrough came in late January. Mark told me he was driving home after a long day when a memory from his childhood suddenly popped into his head. It wasn‚Äôt just any memory‚Äîit was vivid and emotional, like he was re-living the moment. He said it was as if layers of stress and mental clutter had been peeled away, allowing him to reconnect with parts of himself he thought were long gone.

That‚Äôs when he knew The Pineal Guardian wasn‚Äôt just helping him with focus or energy‚Äîit was changing the way he experienced life.

**Why It Worked for Mark**

Mark believes the key was detoxifying his pineal gland. In his research, he learned that environmental toxins‚Äîlike fluoride and heavy metals‚Äîcan calcify this gland, making it harder for the body to regulate sleep, mood, and energy.

The Pineal Guardian is designed to gently cleanse and support the gland with natural ingredients. Mark loved that it wasn‚Äôt some harsh detox but rather a supplement he could easily incorporate into his daily routine.

**Mark‚Äôs Honest Take**

Of course, Mark was clear that this wasn‚Äôt an instant fix. It took consistent use over several weeks to see real results. He also mentioned a few things to consider:

Patience is Key: If you‚Äôre expecting overnight changes, this might not be for you. But if you stick with it, the results are worth it.

Taste: It‚Äôs a supplement, so it has a herbal flavor that might take some getting used to. Mark added it to his morning smoothie, which worked great for him.

Lifestyle Still Matters: While The Pineal Guardian helped a lot, Mark also made small lifestyle changes‚Äîlike drinking more water and cutting back on late-night screen time‚Äîthat enhanced the results.

**Six Months Later**

Fast forward to today, and Mark is a completely different person. His energy is through the roof, his focus is razor-sharp, and he‚Äôs back to tackling life with a sense of purpose and enthusiasm. He even started a new side project he‚Äôd been putting off for years.

What really struck me was when he said, ‚ÄúIt feels like I‚Äôve hit reset on my life. I‚Äôm not just surviving anymore‚ÄîI‚Äôm thriving.‚Äù

**Would I Recommend It?**

After seeing what this did for Mark, I‚Äôm seriously considering giving it a try myself. If you‚Äôve been feeling stuck in a mental fog or just want to see what your mind and body are truly capable of, The Pineal Guardian might be worth checking out.

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs tried it or something similar. Let‚Äôs share stories and tips in the comments!

Iontophoresis is helping reduce sweating, especially for hands, which are noticeably drier lately. Feet remain clammy, with some improvement around toes. High currents cause itching, tingling, and burning but are tolerable. Consider moisturizing and staying consistent with treatment for better results. Overall positive results. Especially noticeable working in healthcare and wearing nitrile gloves daily - I actually have started wearing smaller gloves because they fit so much nicer now and glide on and off.

I want to preface this with the fact that these are my notes I write daily since using it. I have not formatted it in any nice way but it is a running diary of how things have been. I would like to add, this is still a running treatment so I am still adding notes to this daily and expect to. 

At the end I‚Äôve also compiled a little summary with the help of Chat GPT and a TL;DR of my experience thus far. 

Currently I have been aiming for approx 5 sessions per week, or 2/3 days on, 1 off, then 2 days on again but some days have been easier than others due to work commitments. Overall I have seen positive results in the short time I have used it but still need to carry it on.

Background on me:
I am a 29 year old male from the UK, North East England. Suffering with HH since childhood. I work for the Ambulance Service so I wear nitrile gloves daily and have quite a physical job at times. I sweat all the time. Suffer horrendously from Palmar HH. I sweat from everywhere and it‚Äôs horrible. I‚Äôve tried lots of things from weight loss regimes, diet changes, aluminium salts/deodorant‚Äôs, clothing. Spoke to my GP but unfortunately didn‚Äôt get the help I hoped for. Nothing seemed to help. I took a dive to try this as wanted to try something different. 

I‚Äôd also like to add I have used solely tap water for this, following the instruction of approx 250ml per tray too.

ChatGPT Summary:

Key Observations:
	1.	Hands:
	‚Ä¢	Noticeable dryness immediately after some sessions, though sweating often resumes the next day.
	‚Ä¢	Sweating has reduced overall, with days of clamminess instead of full sweating.
	‚Ä¢	Higher currents (12mA-15mA) cause itching, tingling, and occasional muscle spasms but are generally tolerable.
	‚Ä¢	Recent days show significantly drier hands, even during activities like gym workouts and driving.
	2.	Feet:
	‚Ä¢	Higher currents (20mA-25mA) often cause burning, tingling, or soreness, particularly between toes or in specific areas like the arches.
	‚Ä¢	Sweating continues to be an issue but shows a slight reduction. Clamminess is often isolated to toes rather than the whole foot.
	‚Ä¢	Dry skin and soreness between toes have been noted, suggesting a need for moisturization.

Recommendations:
	‚Ä¢	Gradually increase amperage but prioritize comfort to minimize irritation.
	‚Ä¢	Moisturize hands and feet after sessions to address dryness and soreness.
	‚Ä¢	Continue regular treatments for improved results over time.

I am so so sorry about all this text I literally copied and pasted my daily notes so you could see a true reflection of my thoughts.

I would recommend this as a line of treatment for anybody suffering. It is difficult some days but consistency is key. It is a huge expense don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs actually quite a bit for me, but overall for the change and positivity it‚Äôs given me, it‚Äôs been a worthwhile expense. I am still sweating from my head and trunk frequently but it is more manageable as my hands were my biggest concern due to my job. ",1,1737815885.0,Hyperhidrosis,0,1.0,False

1i9o8or,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i9o8or/the_reflection/,THE REFLECTION,"I moved into the apartment on a Thursday. It wasn‚Äôt much‚Äîpeeling paint on the walls, uneven floors, and a kitchen that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been updated since the ‚Äò70s‚Äîbut it was cheap, and I needed cheap. The landlord handed me the keys with a nod, barely saying a word. He seemed eager to be rid of me, like he didn‚Äôt want to stick around.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn‚Äôt overpowering, but it was there. A damp, musty scent, like old wood left out in the rain. I shrugged it off. Old buildings smell like that sometimes.

The apartment was mostly empty, except for a few pieces of worn furniture that looked like they came from a thrift store. In the hallway, there was a mirror. It was tall, maybe six feet, with a thick gold frame that had intricate carvings along the edges. The glass was cloudy, smudged with dust and fingerprints.

I wasn‚Äôt sure why, but the mirror made me uneasy. It felt out of place, like it didn‚Äôt belong there. I told myself I was just being paranoid. Moving is stressful, and this was my first place on my own. Everything was bound to feel strange at first.

That first night, the apartment was eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you‚Äôre being watched. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Every creak of the floorboards made my skin crawl.

The next morning, I decided to clean. The mirror was the first thing I tackled. I grabbed an old rag and some glass cleaner and started scrubbing. As I wiped away the grime, I caught my reflection staring back at me.

Something about it didn‚Äôt feel right. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but it didn‚Äôt look like me. Not exactly. The movements were the same‚ÄîI waved my hand, and the reflection waved back‚Äîbut the eyes felt different. Like they were too aware, too focused.

I shook it off and finished cleaning. By the time the mirror was spotless, it looked like any other mirror. Just a piece of glass in a fancy frame.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I told myself I was imagining things, that I was just spooked from being in a new place. But when I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, I could feel it‚Äîthe mirror. It was like it was watching me.

I kept waking up. Every time I did, I found myself staring at the doorway where the mirror stood, just out of sight. My heart would race, and I‚Äôd have to remind myself to breathe. It‚Äôs just a mirror, I thought. Glass and wood. Nothing more.

By the third night, I started noticing things. Little things. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow that didn‚Äôt match anything in the room. I told myself it was the light, the way it bounced off the glass.

But then, late that night, I saw something I couldn‚Äôt explain. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm my mind. I glanced toward the hallway and froze.

The reflection wasn‚Äôt mine.

It was standing in the mirror, staring into the bedroom. The face was mine, but the expression wasn‚Äôt. It was twisted, wrong. The eyes were wide, unblinking. The mouth was curled into a faint, unnatural smile.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stayed awake until dawn, my back pressed against the headboard, clutching the blanket like it could protect me.

The mirror hasn‚Äôt moved, but something tells me it doesn‚Äôt need to. Whatever is in there, it‚Äôs waiting. Watching.

And I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can ignore it.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. Every creak, every groan of the old apartment sent my heart racing. I kept looking at the hallway, expecting to see that twisted face again. It didn‚Äôt show up, but that didn‚Äôt make me feel any better.

When the first bit of sunlight crept through the blinds, I finally got up. My legs felt shaky as I made my way to the hallway. The mirror was right where it had been, tall and still, with the morning light glinting off its surface.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at it. The reflection was normal now‚Äîjust me, tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I wanted to believe that what I‚Äôd seen was a dream, but deep down, I knew it wasn‚Äôt.

I grabbed a sheet from the closet and threw it over the mirror. The fabric caught on the edges of the ornate frame, covering it entirely. I stood back, feeling a small sense of relief. If I couldn‚Äôt see it, maybe it couldn‚Äôt see me either.

That didn‚Äôt last long.

The rest of the day, I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. I tried unpacking more boxes, but every time I walked past the hallway, I felt it. The mirror was still there, even hidden under the sheet. I couldn‚Äôt explain it, but it was like the air around it was heavier.

By the time night rolled around, I was on edge. I left the lights on, every single one. Even then, I kept glancing toward the hallway.

Around midnight, the sound started.

It was faint at first. A soft tapping, like someone gently knocking on glass. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The sound was coming from the hallway‚Äîfrom the mirror.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt breathe.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent. It wasn‚Äôt random‚Äîit had a rhythm, like someone was trying to get my attention.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. My hands were trembling as I crept toward the hallway. The tapping stopped the moment I stepped closer.

The sheet was still in place, draped over the mirror. Nothing had changed, but I knew better.

I wanted to walk away. To go back to my room, lock the door, and pretend none of this was happening. But something compelled me to stay. My hand reached out, almost on its own, and I pulled the sheet down.

The mirror was spotless, the glass smooth and perfect. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn‚Äôt right. It looked normal, but the eyes‚Ä¶ they felt too sharp, too alive.

I wanted to step away, but I couldn‚Äôt. My reflection leaned forward, even though I wasn‚Äôt moving.

‚ÄúWhy are you scared?‚Äù it whispered.

The voice wasn‚Äôt mine. It was cold, distant, like it was coming from deep inside the mirror.

I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet. The reflection didn‚Äôt follow me this time‚Äîit stayed in the glass, smiling faintly.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ignore me,‚Äù it said.

The lights in the hallway flickered, and the reflection began to blur. For a split second, I thought I saw something else in the glass‚Äîa dark shape, taller than me, with hollow eyes. But then it was gone.

I ran back to my room and slammed the door shut. My breathing was shallow, my hands shaking as I pressed my back against the door.

I didn‚Äôt sleep at all that night.

By morning, I decided I couldn‚Äôt stay here. I didn‚Äôt care about breaking the lease or losing the deposit‚ÄîI just needed to get out.

But when I tried to leave, the front door wouldn‚Äôt budge.

The lock turned easily, and the handle moved, but it was like something was holding the door shut. I pulled harder, throwing my weight into it, but it didn‚Äôt make a difference.

Behind me, I heard the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned slowly, my stomach twisting into knots. The mirror was still in the hallway, uncovered now, and my reflection was back.

It wasn‚Äôt smiling anymore. It looked angry.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave,‚Äù it said.

The voice wasn‚Äôt a whisper this time. It was loud, filling the apartment.

I backed away, pressing myself against the front door. My reflection stepped closer, even though I hadn‚Äôt moved.

‚ÄúYou belong to me now,‚Äù it said.

The lights flickered again, and the apartment felt colder. I don‚Äôt know how long I stood there, staring at the mirror. But when the lights finally came back on, the reflection was gone.

The mirror was empty.

I tried the door again, and this time it opened. I didn‚Äôt think‚ÄîI just ran. Out of the apartment, down the stairs, into the street.

I haven‚Äôt gone back.

But sometimes, when I pass by the building, I can feel it. The mirror is still in there, waiting.

And sometimes, I think it‚Äôs watching me.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do after that. I‚Äôd left the apartment behind, but it didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd escaped. The first few nights at my friend Taylor‚Äôs place were quiet. I slept on her couch, with the TV on for background noise, and told myself everything would be fine.

But it wasn‚Äôt fine.

I hadn‚Äôt told Taylor much, just that the apartment creeped me out and I needed a place to crash. She didn‚Äôt ask questions, which I appreciated. But I couldn‚Äôt keep pretending nothing was wrong.

The first sign came three nights later. I woke up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. The TV was still playing some late-night infomercial, but the sound was muted. I glanced around the room, heart racing, and then I saw it.

My reflection.

There was a large window behind Taylor‚Äôs couch, and in the faint glow of the streetlights outside, I could see my reflection in the glass. Except it wasn‚Äôt just mine.

Something else was there, standing just behind me.

It was the same dark figure I‚Äôd seen in the mirror, its hollow eyes staring at me through the glass.

I whipped around, but there was nothing there. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as I stared at the empty room. When I turned back to the window, the figure was gone.

I didn‚Äôt sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, Taylor noticed the bags under my eyes. ‚ÄúYou look like hell,‚Äù she said, handing me a cup of coffee. ‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre okay?‚Äù

I wanted to tell her everything, but where would I even start? ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúJust couldn‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù

She gave me a look but didn‚Äôt push it.

That day, I tried to keep busy. I scrolled through apartment listings, went for a walk, even helped Taylor with some errands. But no matter what I did, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was being watched.

By the time the sun set, my nerves were shot. I told Taylor I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and went to bed early, hoping sleep would come if I just shut my eyes and waited.

It didn‚Äôt.

Around midnight, I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I froze, my eyes snapping open. The sound was coming from the window this time.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The curtains were drawn, but the tapping continued, steady and deliberate.

I didn‚Äôt want to look. I didn‚Äôt want to know. But something pulled me toward the window anyway.

I reached out with a trembling hand and pulled the curtain back.

There was nothing there. Just the empty street below and the dim glow of a streetlamp.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away, but then I heard it. A voice, soft and familiar, whispering my name.

I spun back to the window, and there it was. My reflection.

But it wasn‚Äôt right.

The glass didn‚Äôt show the room behind me. Instead, it showed the hallway from my old apartment. The mirror.

And my reflection was smiling again.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run,‚Äù it said.

The voice sent chills down my spine. It wasn‚Äôt coming from the window‚Äîit was in my head, echoing like a bad memory.

I stumbled back, tripping over the edge of the couch. My reflection didn‚Äôt follow me this time. It stayed in the window, grinning, its empty eyes locked onto mine.

‚ÄúLeave me alone!‚Äù I shouted, my voice cracking.

Taylor came rushing into the room, her face a mix of confusion and concern. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù she asked.

I pointed at the window, but when she turned to look, it was just a window again. My reflection was normal, the hallway and the mirror gone.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I thought I saw something,‚Äù I stammered.

Taylor frowned, crossing her arms. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre freaking me out. Are you sure everything‚Äôs okay?‚Äù

I wanted to tell her the truth, but how could I? She‚Äôd think I was losing my mind. Maybe I was.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúJust a bad dream.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt look convinced, but she nodded. ‚ÄúAlright. But if you need to talk, I‚Äôm here, okay?‚Äù

I nodded, forcing a weak smile.

When she left the room, I collapsed onto the couch, my head in my hands. I couldn‚Äôt keep living like this. The mirror wasn‚Äôt just in that apartment‚Äîit was following me.

And I had no idea how to make it stop.

The next day, I knew I couldn‚Äôt ignore it any longer. Whatever was happening, whatever *it* was, I needed answers.

I didn‚Äôt say much to Taylor that morning. She was already on edge from the night before, giving me that look people give when they‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôre okay but don‚Äôt know how to ask. I just told her I had errands to run and left.

My first stop was the library. It felt old-fashioned, but Googling ‚Äúhaunted mirror‚Äù and ‚Äúweird reflections‚Äù hadn‚Äôt gotten me very far. At least at the library, I could dig deeper, maybe even find some local stories about the apartment or the building.

The librarian was a small, older woman with kind eyes. She didn‚Äôt ask why I needed information on ‚Äústrange occurrences in apartments‚Äù or ‚Äúhaunted objects,‚Äù which I appreciated. She simply pointed me toward a section of local history books and articles.

I spent hours flipping through yellowed pages and faded photographs. Most of it was boring‚Äîcity planning, old businesses, stories of long-dead locals‚Äîbut one article caught my attention.

It was from the 1970s, about a man named Richard Ames. He‚Äôd lived in my old apartment, the same one with the mirror. The headline read: ‚ÄúMysterious Disappearance Leaves More Questions Than Answers.‚Äù

The story detailed how Richard Ames had vanished without a trace. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his apartment late at night‚Äîwhispers, laughter, tapping on the walls. The landlord found the place empty a week later, except for one thing: a massive gold-framed mirror, left in the hallway.

The description matched the mirror exactly.

I leaned back in my chair, my pulse racing. The article didn‚Äôt explain what happened to Richard or why he disappeared, but it felt like confirmation. This wasn‚Äôt just in my head. The mirror had a history.

But what did it want with me?

I copied down the article‚Äôs details and headed home. Well, to Taylor‚Äôs home. It didn‚Äôt feel like mine anymore.

When I got there, she was waiting for me, arms crossed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been gone all day,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

I hesitated. I‚Äôd been brushing her off for days, but I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. ‚ÄúI need to tell you something,‚Äù I said, my voice quieter than I wanted it to be.

Taylor frowned but gestured for me to sit down. ‚ÄúAlright, spill.‚Äù

So, I told her everything. The mirror, the reflection, the tapping, the voice. I left nothing out.

When I finished, Taylor just stared at me, her mouth slightly open. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious?‚Äù she finally said.

I nodded.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. ‚ÄúOkay. This is‚Ä¶ a lot. But if you think this mirror is haunted or cursed or whatever, why don‚Äôt we just go back to the apartment and get rid of it?‚Äù

Her suggestion caught me off guard. The thought of going back made my stomach churn, but she had a point. If the mirror was the source of all this, destroying it might be the only way to end it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôll work,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm willing to try.‚Äù

Taylor grabbed her car keys before I could change my mind. ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs do it. The sooner, the better.‚Äù

The drive to the apartment was tense. I hadn‚Äôt been back since I left, and seeing the building again made my chest tighten. It looked the same‚Äîrun-down, quiet‚Äîbut now I knew better.

We went up the stairs, and I unlocked the door with the spare key I still had. The air inside was stale, and the musty smell hit me immediately. The mirror was right where I‚Äôd left it, in the hallway, its gold frame catching the faint light from the window.

Taylor walked up to it, inspecting it like it was just another piece of furniture. ‚ÄúThis is it?‚Äù she asked.

I nodded, staying a few steps back.

She tapped the glass. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt look so scary to me.‚Äù

Before I could respond, the reflection shifted.

Taylor froze, her hand still against the glass. Her reflection turned to look directly at her, even though she wasn‚Äôt moving.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered, stepping back.

The reflection didn‚Äôt mimic her. Instead, it smiled‚Äîa wide, unnatural grin that didn‚Äôt belong on her face.

‚ÄúTaylor, get away from it!‚Äù I yelled.

But it was too late.

The mirror started to hum, a low, vibrating sound that made my teeth ache. The air around us felt heavy, like the room was collapsing in on itself.

‚ÄúDo you see that?‚Äù Taylor shouted, backing away.

I saw it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water, and the reflection reached out. A hand‚ÄîTaylor‚Äôs hand, but *not* Taylor‚Äôs‚Äîpressed against the glass from the inside, its fingers curling as if trying to break through.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù I screamed, grabbing her arm and yanking her toward the door.

The mirror‚Äôs hum grew louder, almost deafening, and the distorted reflection of Taylor watched us with that same twisted grin.

We didn‚Äôt stop running until we were outside, gasping for air.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù Taylor panted, her face pale.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúBut I think it wants more than just a reflection.‚Äù

Neither of us spoke for a long time. We just sat on the curb outside the building, catching our breath, our minds racing. Taylor was the first to break the silence.

‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù she asked. Her voice was shaky, but there was a sharpness to it, a demand for answers I didn‚Äôt have.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúBut we can‚Äôt just leave it there. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ dangerous. I mean, you saw it. That thing isn‚Äôt just some creepy trick. It‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAlive,‚Äù she finished for me. ‚ÄúOr something close to it.‚Äù

We sat there a little longer, the weight of what we‚Äôd seen pressing down on us. The mirror wasn‚Äôt just haunted. It wasn‚Äôt just showing strange reflections. It was *something else*, something I couldn‚Äôt explain.

‚ÄúWe should destroy it,‚Äù Taylor said finally.

Her words hung in the air, heavy and final. Destroying it felt like the logical choice, but the thought of going back in there, of facing that thing again, made my stomach churn.

‚ÄúWhat if it doesn‚Äôt work?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat if breaking it makes it worse?‚Äù

Taylor gave me a sharp look. ‚ÄúWorse than it already is? That thing tried to pull me in. I‚Äôm not letting it sit there and wait for someone else to stumble onto it.‚Äù

She was right. As much as I wanted to run away, to never think about that mirror again, I couldn‚Äôt leave it behind for someone else to find.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut we need to be smart about it. If we‚Äôre going to destroy it, we need to make sure it‚Äôs gone for good.‚Äù

Taylor nodded, her jaw set. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it tonight. Before we lose our nerve.‚Äù





The hours dragged by as we made our plan. We‚Äôd bring tools‚Äîhammers, a crowbar, whatever we could find‚Äîto break the mirror apart. We‚Äôd bag up the pieces and take them far away from the apartment, maybe to the river or some secluded spot where no one would ever find them.

Taylor raided her dad‚Äôs garage for supplies while I sat at her kitchen table, staring at the article I‚Äôd found about Richard Ames. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him. Had he tried to destroy the mirror? Had it stopped him?

When Taylor returned, her arms loaded with tools, I pushed the thought away. We didn‚Äôt have time for second-guessing.

‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù she asked, setting a sledgehammer on the floor with a thud.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I said honestly. ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs do it.‚Äù





We drove back to the apartment just before midnight. The streets were empty, and the building loomed in the dark, its windows like hollow eyes.

The air inside was colder than before, and the silence felt oppressive. My heart was pounding as we made our way to the hallway, the tools clanking in the bag Taylor carried.

The mirror was waiting for us, just like before. Its surface was still and smooth, but I could feel it watching us.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get this over with,‚Äù Taylor muttered, pulling the sledgehammer from the bag.

She handed me a crowbar, and we stood in front of the mirror, both of us hesitating.

‚ÄúDo you feel that?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Taylor nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Like it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ alive.‚Äù

I tightened my grip on the crowbar. ‚ÄúOn three?‚Äù

She nodded again.

‚ÄúOne‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before I could say three, the mirror rippled. The smooth surface shifted, and our reflections appeared‚Äînot as they should have been, but wrong. Twisted.

Taylor‚Äôs reflection had empty black eyes and a smile stretched too wide, like it was pulled by invisible strings. Mine was worse. It wasn‚Äôt smiling. It was staring at me, its head tilted, its expression full of something I couldn‚Äôt name.

Fear. Hunger. Hate.

‚ÄúDo it!‚Äù I shouted.

Taylor swung the sledgehammer with all her strength. The impact rang out like a gunshot, and the mirror cracked, a jagged line splitting down the middle.

The reflections didn‚Äôt shatter. They moved.

Taylor swung again, and the crack widened, but now the mirror was humming, the same low, vibrating sound as before. The room felt like it was spinning, the air thick and heavy.

‚ÄúKeep going!‚Äù I yelled, raising the crowbar and slamming it against the glass.

The mirror groaned, like a living thing in pain. More cracks spread across its surface, but the reflections were still there, moving, pressing against the glass as if trying to break through.

‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt it breaking?‚Äù Taylor screamed, hitting it again and again.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt. The humming was deafening now, and the cracks in the glass were glowing, a sickly, unnatural light spilling out.

Then, the mirror screamed.

It was a sound I‚Äôll never forget‚Äîhigh-pitched, inhuman, full of rage and despair. The light from the cracks flared, blinding us, and the air around us seemed to explode.

I was thrown backward, hitting the wall hard. The last thing I saw before everything went black was the mirror shattering, the pieces flying in every direction like shards of light.

And then, silence.

When I came to, everything was quiet. Too quiet.

My head was pounding, and I struggled to sit up. The hallway was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of a streetlamp outside. Broken shards of glass glittered on the floor like tiny stars, and the tools Taylor and I had brought lay scattered.

‚ÄúTaylor?‚Äù My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper. I looked around, panic building in my chest when I didn‚Äôt see her.

Then I heard a groan.

‚ÄúTaylor!‚Äù I scrambled toward the sound, my hands crunching over shards of glass. She was slumped against the wall a few feet away, clutching her arm.

‚ÄúHey, hey, are you okay?‚Äù I asked, grabbing her shoulders.

She blinked at me, her eyes dazed. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe mirror,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt shattered.‚Äù

Her gaze shifted to the pile of broken glass, and she let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúIs it‚Ä¶ gone?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I admitted. My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm.

We both turned to look at the spot where the mirror had hung. The golden frame was still there, but the glass was gone‚Äîreduced to a million tiny pieces scattered across the floor.

But something felt off.

The air was heavy, like the moment before a thunderstorm. And there was a faint sound, so quiet I almost missed it. A whisper.

‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù I asked.

Taylor‚Äôs face went pale. ‚ÄúYeah. It‚Äôs coming from‚Ä¶‚Äù

We both turned to the largest shard of glass lying on the floor. The whispering was louder now, rising and falling like a chant in a language I couldn‚Äôt understand.

‚ÄúI think we need to leave,‚Äù Taylor said, her voice tight.

I nodded, but my legs felt like lead. I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off the shard. There was something in it‚Äîmovement, shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Taylor urged, pulling at my arm.

That snapped me out of it. I stood, gripping her hand, and we stumbled out of the hallway. My heart was racing as we ran down the stairs and out into the cold night air.

We didn‚Äôt stop until we were a block away. Only then did we turn to look back at the building.

The window on the second floor‚Äîthe one closest to where the mirror had been‚Äîwas glowing faintly.

Taylor shivered. ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have an answer. Destroying the mirror had felt like the only solution, but whatever we‚Äôd done hadn‚Äôt fixed things. If anything, it felt worse.

‚ÄúWe need help,‚Äù I said finally. ‚ÄúSomeone who knows about‚Ä¶ this kind of thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike an exorcist?‚Äù Taylor asked, her voice dripping with skepticism.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But we can‚Äôt just leave it like this.‚Äù

Taylor sighed, rubbing her face with her hands. ‚ÄúOkay. But not tonight. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt.‚Äù

I nodded. I didn‚Äôt blame her. My whole body ached, and my mind was a mess.

We went back to her car and sat in silence for a while, trying to process what had happened.

But as we sat there, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we weren‚Äôt alone.





That night, I stayed at Taylor‚Äôs place. Neither of us slept. We sat in her living room with the lights on, jumping at every creak and shadow.

Around three in the morning, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a notification: ""Missed Call ‚Äì Unknown.""

My heart skipped a beat.

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù Taylor asked, her voice wary.

I didn‚Äôt answer. My hands were trembling as I unlocked the phone and checked my voicemail.

There was a new message.

With a deep breath, I pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then, faintly, I heard it.

My own voice.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look behind you.‚Äù

A cold chill ran down my spine. Taylor must have seen the look on my face because her eyes widened.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù she asked.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

Because I could feel it.

Something was behind me.

I didn‚Äôt turn around.

And I don‚Äôt think I ever will.

Clock out of responsibility and checkout of reality. Drive, no, actually speed all the way to the doobie store. Outside the green painted building, a man is half leaning half falling against a brick wall. He's grossly handling what's left of a cigarette. It looks likehe'ss about to light up one he found in the curb. Dressed in a tan mechanic suit that and looks like he was run over by life a few times.

I open the door to a skunky coffee smell. A glass panel with an employee behind it. He looks half stoned, one quarter bored, and the rest just looks like a guy i used to chill with. He's probably a big 311 fan. No hate. ;)

I share my ID, the buzzer buzzes, and i step into the garden of cheifen.

I try to act cool, but im nervous. I know i should be saving money for a hundred other things, but those things are far away, and the lotus flowers are here. The budtender half smiles half sneers a hello. Yeah, it's not the most welcoming moment. I felt like i was interrupting their buzz.

I know exactly what i came for, and it's exactly what I came for last time. The cheapest yet strongest edibles i can find in CO. I know that they know, im a bottom feeder. I get the maximum amount i can for the day, and it comes to almost $150. 

They ask if i have any plans for the night. I make up some shit about going to a movie with friends. That's not true. I just spent all my money, and am mostly estranged from my homies.

I say peace and leave. They know I'll be back. At least once a week. I feel guilt, but it starts to fade away when I put the logo covered bag in my hands and hit the door. Their is a large group of peeps in line or in the waiting room now. I beat the 4 o'clock rush hour. 

As i settle in  the car seat, i pour open the contents onto my passenger seat. Glance around to make sure the cops aren't watching me consume on sight in a car. Fight my way through the safety packaging, and spill 4 gummies into my palm. I tap out two more for good measure. Grinning, i reach for my energy drink.

Bam! All 6, 10mg sour peach candies in my mouth at once. Chewing slowly to enjoy the moment, the texture, the flavor, i finally start to feel like it's me time. Now it's the weekend. Slap on a new cart and rip a hit as i drive away from the jagged shore of the sirens call, the pot store.

It's a 20-minute drive home, interstate, and city traffic to experience. Maybe it felt fun for the first few times i would drive this fucked up. But being honest with myself i know... im the same as a drunk driver at 3pm on a sunny day. 

Most people are not this full of THC this time of day. But im special i tell myself. I work hard, so now i play hard. Almost home now. The Trouble Man albumn plays and explains how life and struggles were for Marvin Gaye in the 70s. Me too, i think, i know pain and hard times...

Cop. Speed trap. Fuck. Luckily im not speeding, but then i realize... ive got 8 or so different kinds of edibles just sprawled out on my seat for anyone to see. I grin and try to play it cool, both hands on the wheel. Window down and its 40¬∞ out. Pretty obvious ive been blowing smoke outta the window so my wifes car doesnt smell like a Doors cover band. My anus could choke a fly im that scared as i coat by the five o.

A block later, when i don't see any blue and reds coming to ruin my life, i clumsily put all the colored candies back in the paper bag. I almost side swipe the car on my left, but they were paying attention and made room for me while honking. I feel sheepish and waaayyyyy to screwed up to be operating anything besides a bag of nerd clusters.

Finally, im home. I have to hide this weed filled bag the size of a sack lunch in my coat as i race past my wifes office and into the bedroom. Throw all that shit in the safe and fall onto the bed. Im gitty and silly and child like.

Now... its Friday. I am tore up. I sit on  the edge of the bed head spinning. AND  THEN I REALIZE... I DIDNT BRING MY COMPUTER AND PROJECTS FROM WORK HOME.

That is specifically against the rules to leave confidential technology and projects out overnight, and over the weekend may be a huge tisk tisk if noticed. Fuck.

Im too stoned to call a coworker and ask them to close down my shit. Fuck, im too stoned to write an email asking for help. 

Panic. Shit. Well all i can do now is wait for Monday morning. Ill have to explain i left my shit out, which may also expose i left early. Fuck...

Im irritable and fidgety. This is not the friday chris tucker explained to ice cube. By next friday, i may have no job, and nothing to do but tell my wife i lost my job because i cut out early to the weed store.

**This was what happened right before new years.** It was a bad weekend. I got fucked up but didnt really relax. Scenarios in my head were growing into monsters i could see and hear. Monday morning arrived. I came in as early as possible, well before my colleagues and the boss. My things were where i had hurriedly left them, seemingly untouched. Is this a test? Will they can me when they come in to the office  at sunrise?

Nope. Not fired. Just sweating bullets and weed all day.

I realized later that i made lots of bad steps that last Friday. Life altering decisions. Employee theft (taking advantage of being salaried), breaking job rules, Spending money irresponsibly, driving high, lying to my wife about small details of my work day, and i hardly enjoyed my weekend.

There were other wake up calls i ignored, but this set of them stuck with me.

**Ive been pot free for 12 days.**

Its friday and i have a job and according to my wife i got shit to do (honey do list).

**I want tell you all im a piece af human trash for driving under the influence. It will not happen again, whether i stay sober from pot or anything that impairs driving**

What is this?,"Best phone calls ever. I legit wouldn‚Äôt mind just having her as a friend if it doesn‚Äôt work out. We talked for 3hrs last night as I got beer drunk and she got wine drunk and smoked weed. We talk about anything, laugh, periods of silence, just all around fantastic. I have more fun talking to her than my actual IRL friends. We are candid about mental health, our pasts. We like the same obscure authors, same obscure music, she works at the same place I used to, same political views. Her pics are very pretty and of course she swiped right on me, but she was initially sheepish about FaceTime weeks ago so I didn‚Äôt press it. This has been going on a month though. I‚Äôll ask if we can meet for coffee that week and she says she has to get back to me. Why? 

I fucked up in the beginning though and backed out a couple times, so she could be just testing me. My mental health got bad at New Years and I‚Äôm in therapy. She says she gets attached quickly. I told her I was short (5‚Äô4‚Äù - 5‚Äô5‚Äù) and she says she‚Äôs 5‚Äô6‚Äù). She hesitated briefly, but she said she didn‚Äôt care and didn‚Äôt understand why I said it as if it was a bad thing lol. She seemed concerned that she would be wider than me? She‚Äôs not fat, I‚Äôm just skinny/fit. She seems to get plenty of attention the way she explained she was tired of hookups. I‚Äôm not an ugly guy though since I seem to get at least a date a week.

She also is pretty bad about responding to texts to the point I thought she was ghosting. I asked if she was still interested and she replied pretty quickly that she was and we called.

She said she‚Äôd let me know on Monday when she gets back to work. She‚Äôs with her friends this weekend. But this is such a strange thing. I know that our personalities are like puzzle-piece compatible. But until we meet in person, it‚Äôs not real. What if she thinks I‚Äôm ugly?

Is she really just that busy and flakey about scheduling? I try to keep in mind I‚Äôm pretty rigid with how I plan things, but damn. We‚Äôre on the phone for 3hrs at night, you‚Äôd think she would want to make time.

1i9o1rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i9o1rs/subdural_hygroma/,Subdural hygroma,"
Hi,my father, 80 years old, has been suffering from atypical parkinsonism for 10 years. The other day, he had what seemed like an epileptic seizure. He was unresponsive to external stimuli, had motor and facial spasms, and his mouth stiffened. It all started very slowly, with him falling asleep and then not responding anymore. Recently, my mother told me that there were times when he would keep falling asleep in his chair, and she struggled to wake him. She mentioned it to the neurologist, who suggested giving him coffee and had just prescribed a medication, donepezil, for the motor spasms, but he didn‚Äôt get the chance to take it.

When he was taken to the hospital by ambulance, they performed a contrast-enhanced CT scan and found a subdural hygroma. The doctors said it cannot be operated on. They administered antiepileptic drugs, and while before he would open his eyes when called, now he doesn‚Äôt open them at all. The doctors said that due to the antiepileptic medications, he is now in a coma. They will monitor him for the next two days, and on Monday, they will probably tell us which care facility to take him to. However, his tests and vital signs are all normal.

I‚Äôve found little information about subdural hygroma. I read that it is a rare condition and difficult to operate on, but I wonder what might happen. Is it possible that he could wake up, even though I don‚Äôt know in what neurological condition he would be?

Soul Sweet Song by Tedeschi Trucks Band is the best way to start your morning.

If you can follow it up with Person to Person by Average White Band with a cup of coffee (smokes optional, I'm not your boss) in the morning, you'll be prepped for a standard morning if you ever come to the boat.

This bus station is like going from a Slayer  concert to a Greensky Bluegrass show from night to day.

Only 16 more hours to go...

I wish when the haters that showed up in this sub they were more intelligent. Not really. Fuck those people. 


Thanks u/Willingplane !!!


I'd feed hot dog pieces to the fishes that live in my neighborhood everyday for a year for a cup of coffee right now. (Totally solvable problem. Lacking motivation to go out in 22 degrees)

The real question is... Should dude have left his phone and my charger when he came out to smoke too?

Getting hungry. Not enough motivation.

That most fucked up story that woman told me last night keeps popping into my head. Those fucking pictures. I didn't handle it the way I should have. I feel like an asshole. 

'Shake it off man. She's gone. It's not your burden to bear.' 

'Goddamnit.'

'Remember... Sometimes you're just there for a minute to deliver a message. That may have been exactly what she needed.'

(I posted it and took it back down immediately. I can't do that to anyone. I apologize if you somehow saw it.)

1i9nzxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharmedCW/comments/1i9nzxn/who_was_the_strongest_witch_out_of_the_halliwell/,Who was the strongest witch out of The Halliwell sisters and The Vera sisters?,"Let me start off by saying I decided to post this in this Charmed subreddit instead of the OG one because those fans are die hard OG charmed fans and did not give the reboot a chance like the fans in this subreddit did.

In your own opinion, who do you think the strongest witch overall out of both sister sets was the strongest? I would have to say Macy was overall. She was a half demon/half witch which made her pretty much unstoppable. I really feel as if the show kept going on and Macy didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdie‚Äù, as she continued to learn her powers and craft‚Ä¶ she would‚Äôve been a super witch. Like I felt the same about Prue. Prue was mastering her powers and died too soon. 

Now who do I feel like was the strongest ‚Äúsisters‚Äù I would say the Vera sisters as well. Reasoning? Their power set was stronger. 

Maggie was an empath and like Phoebe, she was able to basically channel that power to mirror/mimic others and she was able to tap into more things as an empath like telepathy, emotional energy manipulation (converting emotion into raw energy), mediumship, soul transference, foresight, hindsight, emotional inception (the power to manipulate emotions and feelings. She could project someone‚Äôs own emotions onto another being). 

Mel was a time witch. People would always confuse her as having the same power as Piper and that‚Äôs not accurate. While Piper initially was portrayed as a time witch, Leo in S3 explained to Piper once she gained her blowing up power that her powers worked on a molecular manipulation level. She slowed down someone‚Äôs cells to ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù them and then she accelerated their cells to ‚Äúblow‚Äù them up. Mel‚Äôs was Temporal based. She was essentially able to ‚Äústop time‚Äù and ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù literally everything. Piper‚Äôs powers only worked when she was in the room with the person/people/object(s) she wanted to freeze. Mel was able to freeze EVERYTHING literally around her and then some. In the first episode when she discovered her powers, she froze the entire coffee shop and the nearby people outside. She then gained an advancement of her power with temporal acceleration and was able to speed up time and thus was basically able to manipulate time like no other. She was able to essentially ‚Äúheal‚Äù someone by speeding up time and bypassing the normal time it would take someone to heal. With that power she was able to age something to the point of deterioration so essentially it was a much better version of Piper‚Äôs blowing up power. She also gained temporal displacement power to send or bring objects and people to different times and places like the past, present or future. 

Macy‚Äôs powers were unique in the aspect since she was half demon, she had demon abilities. She had telekinesis which we all know is the strongest Charmed power as it‚Äôs the most defensive and can be used in hundreds of ways and essentially can defend yourself without even letting said person ANYWHERE near you. She then gained pain resistance which was a demon trait. She was able to touch a stove and felt nothing even though it almost burned through her own flesh. She also had the ‚Äúevil version of foresight‚Äù and mirrored her baby sisters power and had ‚ÄúThe evil sight‚Äù power which allowed her to see through the eyes of evil and remotely perceive evil events including ones that happened in the past and allowed the user to feel what the evil being was feeling at the time. She also could translate demonic language. She gained pyrokinesis, which was fire power like demons had. She then received a form of advanced telekinesis and was able to move all leaves in a room and stimulated the air molecules at the same time to create a breeze in a circular motion. She then gained telekinetic immobilization which allowed her to temporarily immobilize people and then her last power gained was an energy beam emission which she gained involuntarily and unbeknownst her when she was hypnotized by a demon and generated enough beams of pure telekinetic energy to blast her sisters almost off a rooftop. 

Tbh, the Vera‚Äôs would‚Äôve smoked the Halliwells, imo. They were a ‚Äúnew generation‚Äù of witches thus they excelled at their powers much quicker and in doing so, they gained newer powers quicker than the Halliwells did. They also had unique and better powers. Which is nice because if every set of Charmed ones had the same powers, demons would eventually learn to fight them better. It was nice and smart of them to change the powers up. I truly did enjoy the reboot Charmed and I wish it was given a fair chance by the OG fans. I wish the OG actors didn‚Äôt bash the show, I wish they were supportive of it. They had 8 wonderful years of their show and it‚Äôd been over 20 some years and you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be supportive of a new generation of witches and for the new generation of kids, teens and young adults to enjoy like people of the OG generation did. I was a kid in like 2nd-3rd grade watching Charmed back in the day lol. I‚Äôm a loyal and huge fan of the OG series and rewatch it often. But I also loved the new one too.

I matched with a girl who was above average. After we talked for a long time she said she'd be willing to be fwb with me. I was very happy. This was my chance to lose my virginity and maybe have a normal sex life. I started exercising, changing my diet, I bought a gym membership, I even got testosterone boosters  because I wanted to become a bodybuilder. I didn't want to let anything go wrong. I wanted to have sex and I wanted to feel normal for once! I even stopped watching porn.

We were supposed to meet today and talk face to face at a coffee shop. She didn't show up. She didn't answer my messages or calls. Her profile was gone. Her phone number was unavailable. Then I realized I got scammed. And it's just baffling! I gave her no money or photos of me or any type of personal information that could be used to blackmail me. Why would someone do this? For what purpose? 

I drank my coffee, went on a long stroll and finally returned home. I'm feeling sick. I was the happiest I've ever been because I felt wanted by a woman. To know it was all just a scam, it makes me feel like a pathetic idiot. All I could think of before was how much fun we were gonna have. Now I feel empty. I'm enraged for being made a fool. If I found that scammer I would have beaten them. But I'm no vigilante. I can't find them. Now I'm just laying on the carpet  and considering what self destructive behavior I should engage in, but nothing comes to mind. 

Anyway, don't be like me! If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be careful on dating apps and take care!",4,1737815073.0,ForeverAlone,13,0.59,False
1i9nzok,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1i9nzok/does_this_sub_need_another_rw_mayakoba_review/,"Does this sub need another RW Mayakoba review? Apparently, so here we go.","TLDR: I have no pictures to post with this review because all the pictures are of my six month old smiling or laughing her face off (or of my husband sleeping), which was exactly what we wanted.

SLRS (slightly longer, read some): We‚Äôll definitely be coming back to this hotel, but it does really feel like a hotel for a specific time in our lives. The level of service for the baby was fantastic and meant we could really relax/do our own thing when we wanted‚Ä¶but for me I just need more going on (and imo the hotel isn‚Äôt really focused on people who don‚Äôt want to just relax or do traditional relaxation activities like golf or tennis). So we‚Äôll come back here until the small humans are old enough to go snorkeling etc. (at which point I think we‚Äôd just stay on Cozumel, although would be interested in people‚Äôs takes on where to stay for diving/snorkeling).


We booked this trip with u/alex_travels in November somewhat last minute. We decided we wanted to get out of town of DC in mid-January and we needed a direct flight, some place warm, and some place that would be relaxing with the baby but where I wouldn‚Äôt vibrate into the sun from lack of stuff to do. Everyone we asked (including this sub) said RW mayakoba so off we went. We were in the deluxe lagoon suite which is what Alex suggested we book for a family stay with a baby.¬†

Property: 9/10. It‚Äôs beautiful. It‚Äôs honestly gorgeous. Just walking around was transporting. Plus I loved the boat transportation. I took one point off because the beach wasn‚Äôt ideal, which we knew going in and wasn‚Äôt important to us.¬†

Room: 8/10. I‚Äôll be clear where I took points off because you may think I‚Äôm being too picky so you can add back in.

1) Weird issue with the lights - the lights over the table would flicker every once in awhile, like we were in a horror movie. We videoed it several times so I know I‚Äôm not insane, but the property could never replicate the problem/solve the issue so we ended up just not using those lights. They were super responsive though! (-.5)

2) Door was off its tracks when we got there - we could have fixed ourselves, but we were scared we‚Äôd break it. Was mostly annoying because it was the door leading to the space that we wanted to use for baby sleep space and we needed to get her down for a nap ASAP (-.5)

3) The space that made sense for baby bed didn‚Äôt have full blackout doors. (The master bedroom did and it was amazing). I should have brought the slumberpod but I made a bad wager. Anyway, it‚Äôs just two doors that form a tiny hallway that could easily just be wood with no slats and frankly where you don‚Äôt need the clear spaces to let in light anyway, and since this is the suite they recommend for families it would make sense to me. But oh well. (-1)

Most importantly for us - the plunge pool was great and we spent most of our time there with the baby who was in heaven and splashed everything.

Food: 8/10 I thought it was mostly delicious! (Not everything was a home run but generally great). I also didn‚Äôt feel the prices were as ridiculous as everyone else does, but maybe I‚Äôm just beaten down by living in a VHCOL. I certainly didn‚Äôt feel nickle and dimed - at one point I went to Zapote in the afternoon and asked for a coffee and then asked for the bill and the guy looked at me like I was crazy and said ‚Äúma‚Äôam it‚Äôs just a coffee don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äù

Service: 10/10. Alex told us we should pick RW over banyan tree for the service and I will say the service blew us away. Any time we asked for anything it was solved ASAP. When we got there there were some baby items missing I‚Äôd asked for ahead of time (sterilizer, baby bathtub, etc), which was annoying but they fixed immediately. They told us they would bring the baby bathtub as part of turndown service which began at 6pm, but I asked if they could bring earlier because baby bedtime starts at 630. They then put us on an extra early (around 5pm) turndown service for the rest of our stay. Ramon at breakfast was amazing and was my daughter‚Äôs second favorite person at the resort‚Ä¶behind Maria her babysitter who she LOVED. Whenever she saw Maria coming she would start smiling and making baby screech noises. Maria was fantastic, but honestly would have left the baby with any of the staff there.¬†

On service of Rosewood vs BT which I‚Äôve seen debated - Alex kept telling us ahead of time the service at the RW was much better than the BT which is always frustrating for me because I need specifics/numbers and that‚Äôs just hard with measuring service quality. So for those of you who are like me: we booked the BT first and then switched to the RW with the thanksgiving deals. I had already emailed the BT with some questions for the concierge but hadn‚Äôt heard back from them by the time we cancelled/switched. The RW got back to us TWO days after we emailed them.

Then, one month almost exactly after I emailed BT they got back to me and said yes what can we help you with (‚Ä¶this was after the reservation had already been cancelled). So if you need a number, at least by email responsiveness, the RW is about 15x better on service than the BT (‚Ä¶plus a further ‚Äúthis is actually a cancelled reservation‚Äù discount).¬†

Activities: 2/5. (Not out of 10 because my husband was going to dive but couldn‚Äôt due to weather which is not their fault and I‚Äôm glad they prioritized safety!) Look this is just not a hotel that caters to type A travelers who need to go go go all the time. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúnature trail‚Äù which is really just a walk around the golf course (although pro tip if you‚Äôre breastfeeding is almost exactly the amount of time between feedings if you add in looking at the cenote on property). My husband did a cocktail class on one day when there was rain, but really the bartender just made them three cocktails and gave them two different shots of the liquor in each cocktail (‚Ä¶a terrifying amount of alcohol). I then went on the chichen itza/ek balam tour which I‚Äôm glad I did because the sites were AMAZING (ek balam in particular), but frankly the guide wasn‚Äôt very good and if I hadn‚Äôt done a ton of reading/learning about the Maya ahead of time I think I would have been really frustrated/confused. (If you‚Äôre doing that tour absolutely add on ek balam and skip valladolid and just have the hotel pack you a lunch). I will say the experience has confirmed me in my suspicion of hotel provided history guides - I‚Äôve frankly just never had one I liked that much.¬†When we come back I‚Äôm going to see if I can find a guide through the AIA or something like that instead.

Ability to convince me that they thought my baby was more awesome than any other baby they‚Äôd ever had at the resort: 14/10. Look - do they probably talk to every baby like they talked to mine? Sure, fine. But I‚Äôll never believe you. They made us and her feel so special. Maria even gave her a traditional Mexican dress for the baby to wear when she turns one. 

Overall it was an amazing stay, I would trust the staff with my child at any time, and I‚Äôm going to treasure the memories I have of her here forever. I‚Äôm just also going to be excited for when she‚Äôs old enough to travel in a way that involves more family activities than just peekaboo in the pool (which tbc was very fun, and I will also be sad when she‚Äôs too grown-up for peekaboo). But we‚Äôre already planning a return trip.


Brief hotel rants that are not RW specific but that just make me crazy:

1) Stop putting LED lights everywhere, it‚Äôs undermining all the amazing work you do with blackout curtains etc¬†
2) Why why is all hotel lotion so watery and unmoisturizing whyyyy
3) stop automatically handing every folio to the husband",17,1737815066.0,chubbytravel,2,0.9,False

I am 27Y/M, unmarried, working as a Senior Engineer in a Automotive MNC company in Recently I have applied for a B2 visa so that I can go and visit my sister's family especially my niece who is 3 years old and last year she had a surgery and I wasn't able to go due to work commitments.I have my interview on 31st Jan(coming Friday) and I'm very nervous as I am seeing many rejections. I am not sure if I tell the above the reason as my purpose of visit I will get my visa approved. I have my Manager's approval letter with proper dates. I haven't booked my tickets to avoid financial losses. 

When I went through few reddit posts, people suggested to use FIFA as an reason and I am not sure whether its a good reason to use.

Just to give a quick background about me, I have a car, 2 bikes and some investments on stocks. I have a property but it's in my mom's name. Also I am working on a new venture(Coffee business) and have already purchased the domain and the work is going. How can I increase my chances of getting the visa.

Thanks in advance.

Occasionally right before I go to bed I often have these weird nightmares or night terrors not sure what you wanna call them. But essentially what they consist of eerie visuals like creepy figures smiling at me or faces with no soul in them, black eyes black mouth etc. But the main factor that is consist with all these experiences is a ringing sound (sometimes I can even make out an eerie tone like creepy voilin noises you hear from the movies but way creepier) which then increase at in alarming volume exponentially as my night terror goes on.

The most recent night terror which just happened a few minutes ago which led me to writing this consisted of peaking over a night stand or coffee like table as the ringing started rising. When I peaked over, I saw this creepy woman sitting on my couch, she turned to look at me that's when the ringing got really loud and then I was bombarded with flashing visuals and scary faces and those eerie auditory noises. 

It's not harming to me in anyway but sometimes I wake up sweating and panicking because they feel so real. 

Side note: My experiences are also relatively similar to sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, I hear those same noises and eerie tones as I do in my night terrors. 

I guess what I really wanna know is:

Is this normal?
Is it a nightmare? Night Terror? Or Sleep Paralysis?
Am I in an danger? (I heard that it might lead to EHS) 
Why am I hearing these extremely loud noises in my dreams?

Hopefully someone can answer these for me....",1,1737815019.0,Dream,0,1.0,False

I'm reaching out to this community because I'm really curious about what you value on a coffee bag label. As a specialty coffee roaster and pour-over drinker, I know the label is often our first introduction to what we‚Äôre about to enjoy.

Is it important for you to know details about the producer? Are you interested in learning about the bean varieties used? Processing information? Or maybe transparency in pricing is key for you?

I'm eager to hear your thoughts on what makes a coffee label stand out. Your feedback can help craft better products that resonate with fellow coffee lovers.

Thanks for sharing your perspective!

Just your friendly neighborhood overthinker. I promise I'm more interesting than my browser history (which is mostly food videos and cat memes, if I'm being honest).

About me:
- Professional by day, terrible pun enthusiast by night
- Can cook a mean sinigang but still somehow burns pancake 
- Enjoys both coffee shop productivity days and couch potato weekends
- Actually laughs at my own jokes (someone has to!)
- Collector of random facts that are only useful during quiz nights

Looking for:
- Someone who can match my weird energy and maybe add their own flavor of weird
- Must appreciate good food (or at least pretend to enjoy my cooking experiments)
- Bonus points if you know how to explain tech stuff without making me feel like a confused potato
- Extra bonus points if you're willing to be my food adventure buddy
- Super mega bonus points if you also think pineapple belongs on pizza (I said what I said!)

Let's start with a chat and see if we click! Who knows, maybe we'll end up with a story worth telling at awkward family gatherings. üòä

Please send more than just ""Hi"" - tell me about your most controversial food opinion or your favorite bad joke. Let's make this fun!

The issue is that I'm not as comfortable about women as with guys. I guess that's natural but:

Girl 1 - is sort of bored about her life so she needs friends, she gives short replies and I worry how to keep conversation going. Scared of awkward moments as I'm sure that I will have to do most of the work to keep the conversation going.

Girl 2 - is very confident, I know her by chat for a very long time, she's like not afraid of anything and seems cool, she also games and she's good at it since I played with her before, also very independent. I worry that I'd struggle to keep up with her confidence. Also she already made plans to see me in February few times as well.

I know it's friends only but don't want to make a bad impression. I'm sort of introvert so I got out of my confort zone when meeting new people like this. I will be meeting each of them for a coffee.

We‚Äôd broken up as we couldn‚Äôt find a balance with all the crap happening in our lives at the time

We initially up for coffee about a month ago after we‚Äôd started talking again and I found out that she‚Äôd started seeing someone else. At the end of the evening, I told her that I wanted her to be happy whether it was with me or not. We ended up seeing each other a few days later, and the rest is history. 

She told me that she felt shitty about ending it with the other guy, but loved me, and just didn‚Äôt want to hurt him. She eventually told me that she‚Äôd spoken to him and all was good

We had a rough patch about 10 days ago - a couple arguments about libido, time together, etc - stuff that we‚Äôve struggled with in the past but we came out the other side regardless, and things are on the right track.

Today, I was on her phone for something else and saw that he‚Äôd sent her a long message about a week ago asking how she was, etc. Went back and saw that she never told him she was seeing someone else - just that the distance was too much for her. She answered the most recent message saying that she also still thought about him often and that they should stay in touch.

Is telling an ex that you still thinking about them while you‚Äôre with someone else an issue? Or do I sit back and say ‚Äòshe chose me‚Äô and ignore the whole thing.
