1ncjy44,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1ncjy44/i_tried_to_surprise_my_girlfriend_with_breakfast/,I tried to surprise my girlfriend with breakfast in bed.  but I ended up in the Emergency Room," So I thought I’d be a sweet boyfriend and make my girlfriend breakfast in bed. Sounds simple, right? Toast, eggs, juice, and coffee. No big deal. The plan was to wake up early, cook everything, sneak in like a food ninja, and earn the Boyfriend of the Year award.

Here’s how it actually went, funny me inside kitchen, I underestimated how hot the frying pan was. I flipped the eggs too aggressively, dropped the toast on the floor, then panicked and tried to clean it up with my sock (yes, sock). While juggling all this, I accidentally leaned on the stove and burned my elbow. Still determined, I plated everything burn and all, poured the juice, made the coffee  and then stepped on the cat. Full-on cartoon chaos. Cat screamed. I screamed. Tray flipped. Coffee and juice all over the floor. I slipped. I landed on the pan which, of course, was still hot. Girlfriend runs in, sees me sprawled on the floor, holding a spatula like a defeated warrior, with toast on my head and the cat hissing in the corner. She laughed so hard she couldn’t breathe. I ended up with a minor burn, a bruised ego, and a new rule in the house:  Surprise breakfast must be supervised. Tried to be romantic. Ended up in the ER. Cat still hates me.",1,1757426952.0,story,0,0.99,False

1ncjx8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TLCGypsySisters/comments/1ncjx8e/kayla_and_richard/,Kayla and Richard,"I'm rewatching Gypsy sisters. I'm to the point where Kayla and Richard are meeting up at the coffee shop to discuss their marriage, after Mellie supposedly told on Kayla about having men at the hotel in New Orleans. Which of course Mellie denied like she always does. 

Anyways, the conversation always seems to lead back to Richard not wanting Kayla to do these ""girls nights"". She always makes that seem like such an outrageous request, and she goes on and on about how controlling he is. Personally, I don't think it's wrong of Richard to not want Kayla out drinking/partying with the rest of the girls. Especially after rumors of infidelity. Even without the rumors, we see how those nights turn out. They always get plastered and end up fighting like a bunch of teenagers. Who in their right mind would want their spouse acting in such a way? ",1,1757426892.0,TLCGypsySisters,0,0.99,False

1ncjwib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gentoo/comments/1ncjwib/gentoo_selinux_coffee_me/,"Gentoo, SELinux, Coffee, & Me","I just recently installed Gentoo with SELinux, and wamted to know: For anyone else that's done this, any gotchas I should stay abreast of? 

Here's something I thought was interesting, too: As I'm casually crushing the installation, after I emerge selinux-base, /etc/selinux/config shows 'strict' on the wiki, but dispatch-conf says that file emerges with 'mcs' as the default; I thought that was still experimental on Gentoo? I may be updating this later.

In any case, because it emerged 'mcs', ""Installing policies & utils, #2"" With that first line, indicating a rebuild might be necessary, I feel becomes a definite ""get ready to rebuild selinux-base"" if you leave the emerged default configuration file? 

I did run into: https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1140402.html

I used rlpkg as directed - but I possibly messed something up here, because I had to do it twice, because the first set of labels assigned were generic / unconfined. Quick fix once I saw the labels were set up, but just off. ",1,1757426845.0,Gentoo,0,1.0,False

1ncjw32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ncjw32/aio_or_is_our_relationship_doomed_to_sink/,AIO or is our relationship doomed to sink?,"I 24F met my Turkish girlfriend 33F in 2024 and we started a relationship even though I told her I was young, I was recovering from trauma after an ex partner who threatened to unalive themselves. She pursued me anyway and I gave her a chance after saying no multiple times. Before we started dating seriously she loved everything about me, that I graduated law school, that I was attractive and went to the gym daily, that I came from Europe and had a good life ahead of me with parents that loved me. She loved my sense of fashion and called me unique, different. I appreciated her and felt special with how hard she tried to get to know me better, and how she consistently showed me love and care and always supported me.

Even though she wasn't perfect I never had any issues with her appearance, I told her I would marry her in the future as she is, even if she felt insecure about her weight or emotional scars from past relationships, I didn't care and said if I'm here, I'll be here always because I love her through hard and good days. I just accepted her with unconditional love for who she is, and even when she tried to leave or called herself not enough, I told her she was enough for me and I stayed with her through everything, even when she told me one day she could leave me for a man or that if her family made her choose eventually, she would choose them (She's lesbian and out to her family, and I have been protecting her secret all this time)

Now two years forward we almost broke up numerous times for many reasons like her not answering her phone calls and being unavailable to not explaining certain people in her life she met on a penpal app. I tried to talk to her, I tried to let situations slide many times from her hiding activities online to her dismissing important topics and calling me insecure when all I asked for was certainty and some reassuarance because I also had people break my trust in previous relationships. It has turned into a place where I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, not wanting to ask questions because she always thinks I'm accusing her or using my lawyer skills to interrogate her, when in reality I am a curious person, energetic and full of life. I still ask her about what books she reads, and how she likes her coffee.

This year I have managed to see her more often, I saved money and visited, I just wanted to see her again, but as soon as we met in Turkey she refused to allow me to pay, she confiscated half of my clothes and told me not to wear tight outfits, she critised my social media and we argued so much I almost broke a remote controller and she called me scary and irrational for simply trying to speak about how things affected me, and how I was no longer okay. A month later she came to my European country and almost broke up with me over my outfit again even though there was nothing revealing. (I'm naturally very curvy, but I like tight outfits because I go to the gym and I am really proud of my 5 year progress)

I couldn't understand why she loved me before but now hated everything about me. What was unique and beautiful no longer suited her, what she liked before she disliked now, it was like I couldn't recognize her anymore. I tried to move on and forget, but I told her it would be the last time, if she didn't see a future with me, I would rather that we part ways. We both cried, but stayed, we moved on. Now, three months forward she went through a job crisis and told me she feels ""Nothing"" yesterday, while other times she feels warm for me. I tried to reassure her and said it was 100% normal not to always feel okay, but reassured I would be there for her because I knew she found life hard, I wanted to hold her.. and just made her know she's loved.

Fast forward, she starts telling me appearances are important to her and we argue again. I told her she should save arguments for something more serious, she ends up taking all the stress out on me. I end up leaving the call and we talk and go to sleep. Today I told her I can't take things anymore, that it hurts me, that she can't just tell me ultimatums and continue to threaten cutting off the relationship (indirectly) when something doesn't go her way. I told her I was fed up with her past trauma and her bleeding onto me instead of getting help. I told her I am not her exes and didn't deserve to be treated badly.

I came to a realization that I am tired, hurt, lost and upset. I really wanted to trust this woman, I wanted to be the one for her and I still really love her, because she is the first person I have loved in this way. I gave my virgnitiy and two of my most beautiful years to her... all for the sake of love, I even told her she could move in with me next year because I know life in Turkey is not easy... but she said I should come to Turkey instead, she can't leave her mother, her family or her friends. I never asked her to make such choices, or to think that far ahead, but no matter what I do she becomes negative, she distances for no reason. I am tired of always doing the chasing and apologizing for things I have not done. (I have my own trauma to heal from, I am not the woman she spent 17 years with who cheated on her with a man)

I'm lost and heartbroken... I've been sitting her for five hours lost and confused, and she hasn't even messaged to try and resolve it... she just told me to do what I want and failed to apologize or to acknowledge my pain. I'm tired of being the only one who understands her, but when I need understanding, when I need empathy nothing is ever there for me. I am tired....

I just wish.... I knew what ""Love"" really was or if the problem is really me....I wish it didn't have to hurt so bad.",1,1757426817.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False
1ncjv8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingSuccess/comments/1ncjv8z/teacher_orientation/,Teacher Orientation,"Yesterday i attended my first and last day at SA and holy fuck. When i was interviewing i ignored the red flags of questions like ""how would you discipline?"" And ""have you read the reviews on glass door?"", only because it was the only interview i had since graduating this summer. Upon walking in at 7:30am i was shocked to be suprised with coffee, breakfast, water, and ofc their goody backpack with 2 classroom management books. Then Sarah Wilson began my dystopian day, starting the day with a lot of passive aggressive energy immediately. We went over their standards for professionalism and the culture for 2 straight hours. With lots of emphasis on being bossy, insistence, and making it very clear that any questioning the administration on any decision was a no go. Then we got a 10 minute break where literally everyone went to the bathroom and there was this massive line THAT THEY SAW! Then, upon restarting we were all berated about professionalism and how if we aren't early we are late. This rant went on for half an hour before we got into ""classroom management"", which is just a code word for hyper policing of the body. During this entire session they were telling us how these kids can smell fear and weakness, and THEY WILL EXPLOIT THAT! Emphasizing that less downtime = less opportunity for misbehavior. They also showed clips of classroom procedures, where kids never said a single word and ""behaved at our standard"". I cant emphasize enough how weird these videos are because you can tell by how fast and timid the children are moving they are doing it out of fear. I cant even imagine how awful admins/teachers were to the kids on video before it was filmed. Then for every clip they demanded 4 or more behaviours that stood out to us. With each awnser emphasizing how well behaved, still, and impressive they were acting. Then after they were done bragging about their mini soilders and 3 week behavior bootcamp, they told us if we weren't holding EVERY kid to that standard we were being INCREDIBLY disrespectful. As they genuinely believe that any fidget or movement of ANY body part would snowball into extreme misbehavior. While also telling us how much the kids will respect and love us for holding them to excellence. I felt genuinely confused as they justified needing kids to be this controlled in order to save our precious time, but said we must correct any misbehavior immediately and verbally. Like??? That feels like a contradiction to me lol

Finally we got lunch and then we got another hour of the same thing with them directly saying that if we cant do this basic classroom management we would be bad teachers. After this they had us break up into groups of 4 or 5, where one person would stand up and practice giving directions in a firm bossy tone. They also wanted those pretending to be students to not follow directions if our voice wasn't ""commanding"" enough, so we could practice giving consequences and then telling them to fold their hands and track the teacher. During this admins were walking around and correcting how people were dealing with misbehavior in a really mean way too, like it was obvious and common to expect that a kid doesn't move a literal inch. During my practice go I awkwardly gave a command (the command was something like ""when i say go, sit up straight, fold your hands into your lap, and track me"") and one of my peers decided to not follow the directions, so i just asked her directly to behave and when she did I out of habit said ""Thank you"". At that exact moment a vice principal from one of the middle schools in the bronx was walking by and snapped at me that we dont thank students for the bare minimum. Then when i tried explaining that it was just habit he cut me off and said im too much of a pushover. Then after my group was done practicing my peers were asking the same admin some further questions about the exact expectations we should have of students. He was being super vague but basically saying that if students, sorry i meant scholars, show literally any perceived distraction to give them a consequence. So i asked directly if we should ignore something small like fidgeting with a pencil as they pay attention. He immediately said that was misbehavior and a distraction to the teacher. I just responded that its not a distraction for me so no problem, thats when he practically whisper yelled at me that fiddiling with the pencil ""was FUCKING disrespectful"". Being a person with adhd i was deeply shocked and confused because i knew i could never sit that still, hell i was bouncing my leg that whole day. I simply cannot understand why they focused on ensuring we were policing behaviours when almost everyone in the room had no to little teaching expirence (myself included). This was the only day of orientation for some people, and im shocked they thought any of us could be prepared in any way.

The last 20 minutes of the day they forced everyone to start working on going through all their tasks in Workday, and had assinged us to read and give short essay responses for 2 articles and a 160 page book by tomorrow. So yes after emotionally manipulating us since 7:30am the SA admins sent us home at 5pm with a few hours of additional work, with the knowledge that a ton of their employees had commutes close to 2 or more hours.

All in all, SA purposely hires recent college graduates without a teaching degree so that all the new hires wont have or even hear the arguments that this policing of bodies on the microscopic scale is not a common teaching method. SA doesn't care about students, teachers, and activley prioritizes money and apperances over parents and kids a like. 

SA is an avoid at all costs, after just a single day i was so mentally drained that when i finally got home i just numbly sat in the dark for hours where I spent the whole night awake just from the anxiety of being expected to be a drill sergant to my future students. So instead of getting on a train at 6am, I sent in my resignation letter. While im stressed about paying the bills, at least i can sleep soundly again.",2,1757426761.0,SurvivingSuccess,0,1.0,False

How do I heal from it?,"Me and my bf have been dating for more than 2yrs already. During our relationship, he always assures me that I am the only one he wants and that he's not interested in others. He is always consistent too. He buys me everything I want and makes sure that I don't overthink things. But of course like normal couple, we too have our fights. 

However, last Aug 14, that's when things started to get rocky. We only talk through FB and texts and rarely get to see each other personally. That was on me though, I'm not fond of going out and prefer to stay at home so that was my fault. He also said that it was like I wasn't there during his lows. That whenever he's stressed or tired I don't do anything. And so we fought. I gave him the silent treatment and didn't talk to him for a day (I was only giving him space and wanted him to calm down before I talk to him again). 

The next day, I found out that during that day when we weren't talking to each other, he messaged a girl asking if she's up for coffee. The girl sent me the screenshot and that's how I found out. It turns out that he has been replying to that girl's stories for a while now. There were times when he replies to her even though he said that he was going to sleep. 

I confronted him about this. He said he knew it was wrong and that he was sorry. He said that he had no malicious intentions and that he only wanted to ask her for relationship advice. He also said that he just got ""drained"" from our relationship problem that's why he did that. I forgave him after that. He said he will change and won't do anything stupid again. 

Yesterday, because of something I saw on T1kt0k, I decided to check all the people he added on fb. There I saw all the girls he added and they were 5wks ago, 6wks ago, 7wks ago. That's where it went downhill again. I asked him why he did that. He said that was the time when we had our lows in this relationship. I also asked him what was the reason why he added them. He said because he found them pretty. Mind you all, I am all over his social media accounts. He does not hide me and the fact that we are dating. He said that after I forgave him the first time he didn't do any of those things again. He said that he really wants to change and doesn't wanna hurt me and destroy our relationship again. 

Right now I seriously don't know what to do. I am HURT by what he did. Especially the fact that he did all the things he told me not to do. I have been nothing but faithful to this relationship. I may not be the perfect partner but i have NEVER even thought of another man aside from him. I cried myself to sleep again last night, but still, I can't seem to let go of him. 

How can I heal from this? I know for a fact that I'll forgive him but I don't know if I can recover from this and I do want to fix our relationship.",1,1757426457.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I’ve been working on a newsletter as my side project — something I wanted to read myself but couldn’t find out there.

It’s not just another startup tips email. It goes deep into topics that actually matter but don’t get talked about enough, like:

• How the rich legally save taxes

• What offshore banking looks like in real life

• How money laundering works (yes, the actual methods used)

• Business case studies — both success and failure

• The dark truths behind some of the world’s biggest industries

The goal? To break down complex business and finance topics in simple, fun, and honest language — like how a friend would explain it over coffee. I send out two issues a week and treat it as a passion project, not a growth hack.

1ncjnil,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1ncjnil/is_it_over_are_we_doomed/,Is it over are we doomed?,"I 24F met my Turkish girlfriend 33F in 2024 and we started a relationship even though I told her I was young, I was recovering from trauma after an ex partner who threatened to unalive themselves. She pursued me anyway and I gave her a chance after saying no multiple times. Before we started dating seriously she loved everything about me, that I graduated law school, that I was attractive and went to the gym daily, that I came from Europe and had a good life ahead of me with parents that loved me. She loved my sense of fashion and called me unique, different. I appreciated her and felt special with how hard she tried to get to know me better, and how she consistently showed me love and care and always supported me.

Even though she wasn't perfect I never had any issues with her appearance, I told her I would marry her in the future as she is, even if she felt insecure about her weight or emotional scars from past relationships, I didn't care and said if I'm here, I'll be here always because I love her through hard and good days. I just accepted her with unconditional love for who she is, and even when she tried to leave or called herself not enough, I told her she was enough for me and I stayed with her through everything, even when she told me one day she could leave me for a man or that if her family made her choose eventually, she would choose them (She's lesbian and out to her family, and I have been protecting her secret all this time)

Now two years forward we almost broke up numerous times for many reasons like her not answering her phone calls and being unavailable to not explaining certain people in her life she met on a penpal app. I tried to talk to her, I tried to let situations slide many times from her hiding activities online to her dismissing important topics and calling me insecure when all I asked for was certainty and some reassuarance because I also had people break my trust in previous relationships. It has turned into a place where I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, not wanting to ask questions because she always thinks I'm accusing her or using my lawyer skills to interrogate her, when in reality I am a curious person, energetic and full of life. I still ask her about what books she reads, and how she likes her coffee.

This year I have managed to see her more often, I saved money and visited, I just wanted to see her again, but as soon as we met in Turkey she refused to allow me to pay, she confiscated half of my clothes and told me not to wear tight outfits, she critised my social media and we argued so much I almost broke a remote controller and she called me scary and irrational for simply trying to speak about how things affected me, and how I was no longer okay. A month later she came to my European country and almost broke up with me over my outfit again even though there was nothing revealing. (I'm naturally very curvy, but I like tight outfits because I go to the gym and I am really proud of my 5 year progress)

I couldn't understand why she loved me before but now hated everything about me. What was unique and beautiful no longer suited her, what she liked before she disliked now, it was like I couldn't recognize her anymore. I tried to move on and forget, but I told her it would be the last time, if she didn't see a future with me, I would rather that we part ways. We both cried, but stayed, we moved on. Now, three months forward she went through a job crisis and told me she feels ""Nothing"" yesterday, while other times she feels warm for me. I tried to reassure her and said it was 100% normal not to always feel okay, but reassured I would be there for her because I knew she found life hard, I wanted to hold her.. and just made her know she's loved.

Fast forward, she starts telling me appearances are important to her and we argue again. I told her she should save arguments for something more serious, she ends up taking all the stress out on me. I end up leaving the call and we talk and go to sleep. Today I told her I can't take things anymore, that it hurts me, that she can't just tell me ultimatums and continue to threaten cutting off the relationship (indirectly) when something doesn't go her way. I told her I was fed up with her past trauma and her bleeding onto me instead of getting help. I told her I am not her exes and didn't deserve to be treated badly.

I came to a realization that I am tired, hurt, lost and upset. I really wanted to trust this woman, I wanted to be the one for her and I still really love her, because she is the first person I have loved in this way. I gave my virgnitiy and two of my most beautiful years to her... all for the sake of love, I even told her she could move in with me next year because I know life in Turkey is not easy... but she said I should come to Turkey instead, she can't leave her mother, her family or her friends. I never asked her to make such choices, or to think that far ahead, but no matter what I do she becomes negative, she distances for no reason. I am tired of always doing the chasing and apologizing for things I have not done. (I have my own trauma to heal from, I am not the woman she spent 17 years with who cheated on her with a man)

I'm lost and heartbroken... I've been sitting her for five hours lost and confused, and she hasn't even messaged to try and resolve it... she just told me to do what I want and failed to apologize or to acknowledge my pain. I'm tired of being the only one who understands her, but when I need understanding, when I need empathy nothing is ever there for me. I am tired....

Sooo, today my daughter calls me and asks for help ( she's been throwing up all night with a stomach bug). Oh and by the way Susie ( 7) left her backpack at my house last night so her lunch bag is in there too.
OK, no problem, be there soon. Gather my things ( throw some saltines and a mr noodles in a bag for my daughter)and the backpack and off I go..nope, my car is blocked in with my other daughters car and her boyfriends car, both asleep and no keys around. 
I'm lucky enough to live walking distance so I decide to walk bringing along a travel coffee too. No problem, I walking along and turn around, my cat is following me, arrrgh..! I'm trying to chase him back and he's a cat so he's of course not co-operating..
The clock is ticking so I was fine, he can come and I'll just lock him in a bedroom til I get back from drop offs. He follows me the whole way and I get there and can't get him in the house, he's running on the road being a complete jerk ( lol) 
I quickly check on the kids, give Susie her backpack and tell her to clean it out and I'll help her pack a lunch in a minute. My daughter yells from the bathroom where she's currently hugging the toilet that it's all ready on the counter just tell Susie to pack it. Ok! I tell Susie to help her little sister get ready and I'll be back, I have to get the cat.
I end up walking the two blocks back home so he will follow me and get back in the house, shake the kitty treats and he's back in. Ok, done. Clock is ticking...
Walk back to my daughters and kids are doing great, a little dis-sheveled but whatever it'll do. They also both want a baggie of saltines because it's their "" Favorite Cracker"" . Ok! No problem. 
I say to my daughter "" I need your car, mines blocked in"" She can't.find.her.keys. we are looking and finally find them next to a box of cereal on top of the fridge! ( daddy had used her car to get milk last night) .
We are good to go! Off to school and daycare!

I finally get home, really ready for a second coffee and the boyfriend car is gone. He ever so diligently locked the door behind him when he left and guess who doesn't have a key??

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that’s tighter than a *arepa* overstuffed with shredded beef. On Tuesday, September 9, Venezuela and Colombia clash in Maturín, where one team will secure a World Cup playoff spot and the other will savor a stress-free victory lap. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Venezuelan oil rig and the humor of a Colombian *cumbia* gone wrong.

---

### The Odds: A Tug-of-War Waged with Decimal Points

The bookmakers are as divided as a couple arguing over whose turn it is to do the dishes. Bovada gives Colombia +2.65 odds (implied probability: \~38%) and Venezuela +2.6 (39%), while the draw sits at +3.05 (33%). BetOnline.ag and DraftKings throw in slight variations, but the message is clear: this is a 50-50 coin flip dressed in soccer jerseys.

For context, Venezuela needs *all three points* to guarantee a playoff berth, while Bolivia (17 points) lurks like a vulture, hoping for a slip-up. Colombia, meanwhile, is the relaxed uncle who already claimed the last slice of cake and now just wants to avoid spilling coffee on his shirt.

### The News: Venezuela’s Desperation vs. Colombia’s “Meh” Attitude

Venezuela’s recent 3-0 drubbing by Argentina reads like a horror story: “*El Tri* entered the Buenos Aires nightmare, emerged with three fresh scars, and now must summon every ounce of magic to avoid a World Cup banishment.” Their Monumental Stadium (capacity: 51,796) will be a pressure cooker, but can they cook up a win? Their attack relies on Salomón Rondón (5 goals) and a midfield that’s less “symphony” and more “chaotic jazz.”

Colombia, meanwhile, is the sports equivalent of a tourist who booked their flight six months ago, packed their sunscreen, and now just wants to take selfies. Manager Néstor Lorenzo hinted at “possible changes” to the starting XI, which translates to: “We’ll play James Rodríguez and L

1ncji1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathBattleMatchups/comments/1ncji1n/why_homelander_vs_yujiro_is_the_best_matchup_for/,Why Homelander vs Yujiro is the best matchup for both (imo).,"[Source: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DeathBattleMatchups\/comments\/1f98ac3\/yujiro\_hanma\_vs\_homelander\_grappler\_baki\_vs\_the\/](https://preview.redd.it/gpccwd62i4of1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=89287bc49cb1f5a7467805aa3a7827637bb78467)

# 1: Contrasts.

The contrast are an important part of this matchup's appeal but they're also the least important and interresting part so let's just get them out of the way right now:

* Yujiro is an actual martial artist, Homelander can't fight.
* Yujiro got his powers naturally, just training and insane genetics while Homelander got his in a lab.
* Yujiro is from a Japanese Shonen Manga, Homelander is from an American Superhero Comics (more on that USA vs Japan duality later).

At their core, Yujiro and Homelander are like an evil Goku vs Superman when you think about it.

# 2: The Connections.

* Both characters are the absolute peak of power in their respective verses.
* Both characters inspire a great deal of fear and respect to those around them because of that aforementioned strength.
* That respect comes from what the two characters use that strength for, which is whatever the fuck they want. These two characters might as well be the embodiment of ""who gon' stop me ?"" They represent the ideal of unchecked absolute freedom and other characters, especially in Baki, respect how free they are and envy them. Fucking Homelander's catch phrase is literally ""I'm the Homelander and I can do whatever the fuck I want.""
* Both characters are detestable human beings, evil scumbags rotten to the core who did some of the most heinous crimes you can think of, assault, murder, rapeetc... Notably, Yujiro is a Vietnam war criminal and Homelander is responsible for 9/11 in the comics.
* Both characters are extremely egotistical and are very insecure about it, they'll legit crashout over the faintest hint of an insult towards them.

The next two connections are the most important to me, and will require their own part dedicated to them:

# 2) a) Both characters are fathers.

Yujiro have Baki, Homelander have Ryan. Both characters are fathers and that fact is a pretty important part of their life as it essentially changes everything we previously knew about them, they see the entire world as ants beneath them except this one person where it's a bit deeper than that. They essentially both have a rather complicated love-hate relationships with their sons. For Ryan it's obvious that he's conflicted about Homelander and doesn't know what to do with him, the poor kid is just completely lost in every way at this point and for Baki it's even more complicated.

In the Father-son fight arc, Baki admitted how he feels about Yujiro, that there's a great deal of hate and fear within him. And yet, Yujiro remains his father, so there's also a great deal of respect, admiration and yes even love for his father. The sad part is that Baki could have had a normal childhood if it weren't for Yujiro being such a menace to society 24/7, Yujiro chose to be The Ogre, he chose to be this way when he could have behaved differently with Baki and especially his mom.

We saw it in this arc, Yujiro try to behaves in a normal way, he tries to see what Baki crave for in a normal father-son relationship, he shows respect and politeness to Baki, he genuinely mellows out and actually try to understand but it's useless, he's the Ogre and he'll always be the Ogre, he chose to become this monster, which is why his relationship with Baki can't ever be normal, even tho it's clear that they love each other in their weird-ass Hanma way.

Yes I know he says the opposite, that he's not interrested in it but he's obviously lying, both to Baki and himself, he wouldn't bother joining Baki for coffee and and dinner and doing all that if he wasn't at the very least *curious* about it.

https://preview.redd.it/zu5qx8v0m4of1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4aba03e63b3ba0330f931e49bfe9cb61aa93bf4

Both kids are essentially fated to kill or at least defeat their fathers, Baki will maybe get a rematch with Yujiro in the future and Ryan is most certainely going to fight Homelander later down the line.

This whole ""being a father"" connection between Yujiro and Homelander, is genuinely interresting, the one part of their character that grounds them, makes them more human. Giving them a family, a legacy, something to care about.

Well, there's one other part that makes them human:

# 2) b) Loneliness.

Both characters suffers from major mental issues due to their choices and status, and both for very similar reasons.

Homelander feels alone, he said so himself even tho he can't phrase it very well, being so much stronger than everyone else bothers him, it bothers him because there's no one that can relate to him, no one that can be close to him or understand him. This is of course entirely the fault of his own ego, he can't see other people at the same level as him, he doesn't see other people as actual humans which causes him to feel alone. Not only that but in the latest season of the Boys, Homelander realises that he's growing older which again causes him a lot of mental problems, hence his out of the blue obsession with raising Ryan, he wants to have a legacy, something to leave behind him. He feels like a god alone at the top going through a mid-life crisis.

>*""Sometimes it's hard being superior to every single other person on the planet. It's isolating. And Gods should not have to feel that kind of pain. Because that is what we are. You and me. We're gods.""*

https://preview.redd.it/0m48n2adj4of1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=10cc6bba635e08eeee54ee8bc0f6385717aca763

On the other hand, Yujiro's anguish is completely related to him being a warrior. Again it's best explained in the Father-Son Fight arc. In which Yujiro describes that his absurd strength makes him feel like he already did everything that could be done in life.

There are many characters in fiction who are warriors that live for combat, Battle Beast in Invincible, Goku in Dragon Ball, Wamuu in JoJo, you name it, combat is their reason for existing, hell the vast majority of Baki characters are smoke demons that fit that mold.

But Yujiro is the logical conclusion of that character archetype, the end result. A character who got what he trained for and became the strongest creature on Earth. But achieving that robbed Yujiro of an objective in life, a purpose, he has nowhere to go now, nothing to do, nothing else to accomplish, he's empty.

Yujiro says it best:

>*""One day I truly got it. I realized where I was standing. At the top. When you are at the top, there is nothing to aim for. The top is empty and has nothing around it. There is nothing to achieve by taking a step. (...) You guys simply don't know what it feels like to have strength so great it even steals your dreams. It even exceeds the boundaries of human strength. It takes away every aspect of your life. And of course it also takes away the light.""*

https://preview.redd.it/37fbdqngh4of1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c2012e62f180717d35ab370ac89299ed767a772

It really recontextualize his whole selfish reason for having a son in the first place, he doesn't want Baki to fight him just to have fun, he wants Baki to beat him so he can have a purpose in life again, he doesn't want to feel that emptiness anymore, which is exactly what makes him a villain because he failed to realize that raising a son, becoming a father is also a purpose by itself.

These characters are depressed, these characters feel alone, empty or misunderstood, they are dead beat fathers who feel like the only person they can turn to is their own flesh and blood and the best part in all of this is that this mental suffering is entirely self-inflicted. Baki's objective has always been to beat Yujiro and then move on with his life, Ryan surely feels at least similar to Homelander, meanwhile Yujiro and Homelander are obsessed with their kid, almost like they live through them in a way. They can't move on because if they do then they'll have nothing else to do with their lives.

# 3) American vs Japan symbolism.

There's no denying that these characters almost represent a grotesque parody of what a peak human is for their respective countries.

Homelander is a perfect representation of modern day america, Homelander doesn't have a secret life or Identity, even John isn't really his name, his one and only name is Homelander, his only real Identity, a public personna forged by an evil corporation (pleonasm lol) solely for public image and profit. Everything that Homelander is is on the surface, he is hollow, empty, there is Nothing to see behind the curtains, just like how everything that america is is the surface and is empty behind it, hollow, meaningless. Homelander as a character is only concerned about posturing for profit and personnal ego, just like america is also all about posturing for profit. Brands for short. America, Homelander, they're not a country and a person, they're brands, an image, an idea to sell. Nothing more. Both Homelander as a person and america as a country are plagued by the corporate sub culture.

On the other hand, Japan and Yujiro. Yujiro is also a grotesque exageration of the perfect japanese warrior, there's a reason why his nickname is the Ogre, he's compared to a japanese Oni, a mythical beast who represent absolute unshakable power. But unlike Homelander, Yujiro isn't really concerned about his image, matter of fact he was relatively unknown from the public until the Father-son fight with Baki (which was broadcasted live on TV accross the world) and ""The Ogre"" was a rumor more than anything. But since that night, Yujiro became a world wide celebrity, which annoys him quite a lot as he can't go anywhere without some dumbass asking for his autograph now which ties into the idea that japanese people generally don't like to stand out, there's exceptions of course but the general cultural consensus in Japan is to blend in and diseappear into the crowd. That's not saying that Japan doesn't care about their image, they most certainely do but unlike America, they actually have substance to back it up, they have actual history that dates further than like 200 years, actual cultures, tradition. If USA is all style no substance, Japan is both.

That Japan-USA duality can go even further with some key details, like the fact that Homelander is typically very racist to anything non-white american just like how Yujiro generally prefer japanese things but he especially hates america and almost makes it his personnal mission to straight up bully the US army on a daily basis, the US army might as well be his personnal Uber driver at this point, his hobby is just humiliating them for fun.

Not to mention that in the next season of the Boys, Homelander will start to enter the political scene and in the comics he straight up took over the country and became president.

And in the Baki manga, there's a tradition that every new US president must swear an oath of friendship and non-aggression not to Japan but to Yujiro Hanma specifically. An entire country swearing such an oath to just one guy, ain't that crazy ?

[Yes, this is Obama briefing Trump about the Oath of non-aggression in the oval office. In the Baki manga yes. This is a real scene.](https://preview.redd.it/cru7t235l4of1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=52de5ac467f7c42f8dad1b1c65820a09f16a084a)

I can already see the setup in a Death Battle episode, Homelander is elected president, his predecessor tells him about the Oath, Homelander finds it stupid and fly to Japan to confront Yujiro about that and a fight ensues because of it.

And it's for all of these reasons that Homelander vs Yujiro is the best for both imo.",3,1757425904.0,DeathBattleMatchups,1,1.0,False

* Put KPIs in this order: **Reach → Impressions → Frequency** (if your source provides it)
* Add period-over-period comparison and a short note/insight explaining the change
* Break down by campaign/placement to spot where frequency is too low/high

First time pregnancy.,"Hey all, this is my first one and I'm about 5 weeks along. It's still crazy early, yet I catch myself being so uncoordinated and confused at times, which is not typical for me. For example, yesterday I drove to an office location for work (I mostly work remotely, but I've been to this office a million times) and first I started driving in the wrong direction (north vs south), then I missed my exit, then I missed the street I was supposed to turn into, then I drove into the driveway of the wrong business. Id say this is the amount of driving errors I make in a full year normally, it's wild for it happen in one day! Then this morning I made myself iced coffee and proceeded to spill every single thing there was to spill - the ice, the water for my coffee machine, the milk... Again, otherwise I cannot remember the last time I spilled anything. 

Is this kind of brain fog concerning? Does it happen to anyone else and if so, does it get worse or better?

I'm 51 years young from the UK, and im just the bloke next door with grown up kids and a wife, on the surface we seem fine just like everyone else, but underneath things are not so great. 
I make no apologies for being who i am though, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve.

*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

It’s nothing glamorous, just a cozy place where people come in for their daily caffeine fix, and I’ve been there long enough to recognize most of the regulars by sight.

About six months ago, this one person started coming in almost every morning. They always ordered the same thing—a medium cappuccino, sometimes with a croissant if they looked extra tired. They never really said much, just smiled politely and tipped well.

One morning, their card got declined. They looked so embarrassed, muttered something about transferring money later, and started to leave. I don’t even know why, but I told them, “It’s fine, just take it.” They looked so relieved, thanked me like I’d just saved their life, and left.

The next day they came back, trying to pay me double, and I just waved it off. It kind of became a habit after that. Sometimes they’d pay, sometimes I’d “forget” to charge them. It felt good. It wasn’t about flirting or anything, I just liked seeing them relax a little. Like, life is hard enough, and a free coffee isn’t going to bankrupt the shop.

Here’s the part I’m ashamed of: I never learned their name. Not once. For six months, I’ve been handing this stranger free coffee, having small talk about the weather, nodding when they tell me about their long work shifts… and I still don’t know what they’re called. It’s way past the point where I can just casually ask.

Last week, they stopped coming. I don’t know if they moved away, changed jobs, or just found another café. I didn’t realize how attached I’d gotten until the routine broke. Now every morning feels weirdly empty, and I keep catching myself looking at the door.

I keep thinking about how I’ll never even know their name, and how I basically just… gave free coffee to a ghost who disappeared.

I don’t regret it, but I do feel stupid for never making it more than small talk.",15,1757425401.0,confession,10,0.83,False

1ncj7it,https://www.reddit.com/r/resinprinting/comments/1ncj7it/i_want_to_make_money_resin_printing/,I want to make money resin printing,"I see a lot of posts about how to start a print farm, how to make a buck, whether this is an easy way to make money.  I mean, the machines do all the work right? 

I was responding to one of these posts, and my comment ended up becoming kind of long, so I made my own post to share a bit about what it was like trying to start a print farm.  Or really, what it was like trying to make money from a few printers in a spare room. 


This post is addressed to you.  You who want to make easy money, selling products made by machines in your home.   


So, I've run a handful of printers out of a spare room and sold a lot of prints, some filament, mostly resin.  

If your goal is valuing your time, making any kind of money, or enjoying the process of resin printing, I would highly recommend doing literally anything else other than this.

There are two big reasons why-

1: the market for selling prints is highly competitive, and honestly, kind of fucked up.  To get sales, you will need to have extremely consistent, perfect prints, at a really low price.  This makes it really hard to get much back for your time and labor, because resin printing requires a lot of time and labor.  This leads us to the second problem. 

2: resin printing is labor intensive.  Printing the odd thing for your personal hobby is kinda fun.  Printing to sell is a constant stream of managing print cycles while simultaneously cleaning and replacing build plates, and cleaning and prepping the dozens of pieces that are coming off of those plates. 

Resin printing for selling is, and I cannot stress this enough, an awful, awful job.  And this from somebody who likes the smell, likes the process, and likes all the finicky bullshit.  




Other considerations for your half-baked resin business dreams (though we both know you are really just trying to justify buying a new machine or more stls.  Sure.  It's an investment.  Spending money will definitely pay off in the future.  Did you hear there is a new printer that fixes all the problems with the one you just bought?). 

I had an entire workshop retrofitted from a largeish spare room, and it was still awful.  

Dealing with the waste and mess from trying to produce enough models to sell is a pretty huge task.   Resin mess and stains everywhere.  Overtime dust and regular everyday grime gets into everything and mixes with resin stains that accumulate fucking everywhere.    Everything is constantly sticky.  So many rags.  So much paper towel.   So many nitrile gloves.    So many piles of sticky half cured supports and failed prints. 

I had 4 machines running in a ventilated closet that kept stuff pretty neat and tidy with the machines themselves, but at any given moment the rest of the room was a disaster.   The room also had a large balcony, incidentally.  My electricity was also free at the time, so I'm not sure how that might factor in for you.  My machines were running pretty constantly, and I'm sure the electricity costs may have been not-insignificant if they hadn't been included in my rent. 

Again, I want to stress how awful it is spending an entire weekend working your ass off to fill resin orders.   The cleaning process is awful.  High chemical exposure. The fumes.  Dry cracked hands from chemical exposure and wearing gloves for hours.  Your prints are failing and you have to diagnose why, clean the vat again, replace a fep, replace a lamp or lcd, but the janky Chinese print company doesn't sell parts of if they do it almost makes more economic sense to just buy a whole other printer because of the lead times.   And the whole time you are juggling all of that you have orders to fill and have committed to tomorrow to deliver those orders.    So that's how you spend your whole weekend, and if everything goes well you work hard and fill the orders.   Now go online and see what a printed mini actually sells for and ask yourself if that's worth your time? 


Did I make money? 

Kind of. If I don't value my time, at all.   I might have paid off my machines.   I probably paid for some of the resin I used.   There were a lot of consumables that were a significant cost that I tried not to think about too much, and probably didn't get factored in as a cost as much as they should have.    

Would I have made more money washing dishes in a restaurant?   Fuck ya I would have.  Probably several hundred times for the time and costs I put in. 


If your goal in doing this is to make money, you should do literally ANYTHING else.  Go be a coffee barista.  Work retail. Literally anything will make you more money per hour than this. 

I'm not gonna say what you are proposing is impossible, or even that you shouldn't do it. 

If you want to do this because you like it and you want to continue your own personal hobby, and spend a lot of time and money making minis you like, you should do it.  Selling some stuff on the side might even pay for some of your resin. 



Even more considerations: 

Dealing with customers is terrible.   This isn't unique to resin, but it's a big one.  Even the nice, normal customers are terrible. 
They often want something custom.  This is usually why they are talking to you and not buying off a shelf in the first place.  
But they still want the thing they want to be cheaper than off the shelf.   They don't understand how anything works, and you can't tell them how stupid and unreasonable they are, and you have to be nice, and try to give them what they want, within the limitations of reality, and resin, and your time and effort.  Usually this means that you will end up bending over backwards for them, and they will ultimately be disappointed, because compromises will be made.    Even when they are totally happy and come back for more, the time involved with dealing with them is usually not worth it.  
The vast majority of the time they just use up a lot of your time being polite and curious and asking you ""how much for really specific thing?"" and then stop replying after you start talking prices.  


If you do this, I highly recommend going to your local game stores, and seeing if you can give them a commission to sell through them.   Most STL designers won't let you do this.   Most game stores also aren't interested in this (they might let you leave a stack of business cards on display somewhere though, or a link to your Instagram or whatever). 

However.  Giving away free models, helping out with free painting nights, and generally being involved with communities of people who are doing stuff for enjoyment's sake isn't just a good way to get business, it's fun and makes the whole process less awful.  People in person are fun.   Giving happy kids dinosaur models or whatever is fun.  Chilling with the local painters is fun.  This side of it is a lot better.  

I found a local store that was willing to have a little shelf of my work.  I put whatever models I liked or thought would sell on that shelf with price tags, and left an inventory.  I gave the store a 25% commission on anything sold. For a long while the store did this on no commission just being nice, but I ended up insisting on a commission for them, partly to be taken seriously, partly to keep in their good graces.  This helped a LOT and they ended up giving me a bigger shelf afterwards.  

This worked pretty good for a while.  Way better, way more customers, way less wasted time in DMs, way less time slicing new orders or figuring out custom shit and revisions.  
I would just come in every month or two, tally up what had sold from the inventory, dump another lot of models on the shelf, and count out the stores 25% cut from the little stack of cash they tallied from the inventory. 
There are new losses to consider here though.  Stuff gets broken, accidents happen. Kids.  This type of thing is hard to predict and price for. 

As the store got more popular, people started stealing my work off the shelf. Slipping minis into pockets. This in itself was honestly less of an issue- the real problem was that something that was easy and fun for the store and me was suddenly a source of distress and bad feelings.  They would feel guilty about stuff being stolen, but weren't really interested in instituting new practices for preventing theft.  I was bummed about the thefts, but more concerned about maintaining our good relationship, and not being a pain in the ass and losing access to all those sales and customers.  


Future? 

The owner says he wants to have a glass display case for more orders and so no more theft and less accidents.   He might call me sometime.    I might even take him up on it.... But probably not. 

Going forward, when I occasionally print stuff for myself, I'll probably keep filling build plate corners with little minis I like.   They will keep filling up spaces in my house.  Maybe I'll sell a few on the side.   Maybe I'll give a few away to people who are telling me about their DND character that might kinda look like that, or to kids who will promptly break them.  Maybe I'll find a little shelf at a game store again, and I'll make back a few hundred bucks that will buy some more resin and filament, or maybe even a new machine. 


These have been my experiences trying to do what you are talking about.   It's possible you will succeed where I failed, but those are all definitely things that you will need to contend with. 

I'll end with the following, however. 

For now I'll just print what I want. 

I'll go back to the store for painting night.   I'll go for a beer.  I might try to organize a game.  I'll bring some free models for people, if I feel like it.  I might even sell something if I get asked for something that's not a complete pain in the ass.   I might make some terrain or characters for somebody's campaign.  

It's all good.

Honestly, and amazingly, not so bad right now. Not as hard as I remember quitting smoking cigarettes from a pack a day, which took me dozens of attempts. Like, I know that barring some huge upset, I’m going to see this through. With cigarettes, I never had that confidence. Part of this may be that I read Allen Carr coming into this one, and I recommend you do the same.

Even stumbled into one I had forgotten to throw away a few minutes ago. Wasn’t a big deal. Poured my coffee on it, closed the lid, gave it a nice shake and chucked it in the trash.  

Anyway, most of what I’m dealing with feels a little bit neurological in terms of withdrawal. Like a floaty disconnected feeling from my limbs and/or heavy legs. I would love to hear from others if you dealt with the same, and how long it lasted. It creeps me out a little bit and I’m eager to get to the other side of this part.

But I know whatever is happening, it’s on the path to me being much healthier and normal. And I just wanted to check in to say, from what should be the most turbulent part of the storm, it’s really not so bad and you can do this. ",2,1757425081.0,QuittingZyn,2,1.0,False

No idea what to say. I just got aware of the fact that I wanted to talk to you, so bad. It's so heavy. Having to miss someone who is still alive, but you have to treat them like they are dead. God, what a heavy feeling. I hope you are well, like fixed your relationship stuff kind of well. Thriving and being social like before, being your happy self. I don't who has been more unfair to who between us lol. I don't know, perhaps we are both sort of a lil bit of assholes. but I'd like to think of you being the bigger one, cause that gives me a better feeling!

I also like to think you weren't and aren't good for me cause both of my depressive episodes which lasted for at least 2 years were triggered by being in touch with you. That last one you are unaware of, but you could tell if you paid attention and I know you aren't a genius in the emotions department. Neither am I but life is kind of forcing me to become better at it.

What else, how are you? like how are you? like really how are you?

I was just praying and then I got this thought while sitting on the prayer mat, if you were here and you told me to come meet up for a coffee. Would I actually go and meet you? The answer is yes. Even if I had to drive for a few hours? The answer is yes. Would I take a flight? Hell no, we don't do that lol. Idk why that made me laugh.

Anyway I wouldn't do that for most people, you are truly one of the few, and perhaps you may have realized, you probably did. We may have ended up killing each other if we ever lived together for longer than a few months. Let's not act as if we are soulmates. But there is something, just some peace? and safety? and some affection.

It's okay, we were kids and we were clueless and stuff happens, but Idk why Im carrying this feeling for a long time, It's sucha riddle to me. and the way Im still carrying it, it seems like it'll stay here for a lifetime. Is it like a test from Allah? to see if I'll do the right thing even if I miss a person so much? like for longer than a decade and half. You would think a person is replaceable. I mean like at the very least, we would forget about it after a while? Sucha weird thing. Anyway I honestly don't know, but be well.

I hope life is treating you well, I make dua for you every now and then.

May Allah have mercy on you.

and one last thing, I really really really really wish we could have stayed in touch or that we could talk. I wish we could talk. It's probably unhealthy to miss someone this much innit? I just wish we could talk. or be best friends, or - you probably being too busy anyway- in the hospital and stuff. and thats hella annoying, being in touch and you being too busy to talk.",2,1757425072.0,letters,1,1.0,False

There is another store in the same chain about 15-20 minutes away from the Uni by car, Job B.

  
So I'll need to leave my current job at Job A when I move, the original idea was to go to job B and work there during academic season but then I'll be coming back home during the summer.

  
So I would have to commute 30-35 minutes to Job B if I kept it, or if I went back to Job A, I would only be keeping with them for the Summer period.

  
So far the options are the long commute to Job B, or switching between Job A and B during Academic and Summer seasons for the next few years.

so i rang up a doppio which was $2.50, and he went to pay and his card declined.  his face turned bright red and he tried it out again and it declined.  before i thought to offer to cover it, he left to grab cash.  he then waited in line, his face still bright red, and avoided eye contact as he grabbed his drink and hurried out of there.  i felt bad for him but was too busy to come up with something to say to help him feel better ",4,1757425003.0,barista,0,0.75,False

1ncj04l,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecideWise/comments/1ncj04l/nespresso_aeroccino_4_is_simply_amazing_it_just/,"Nespresso Aeroccino 4 is simply amazing, it just works and it works great.","I’ve been using the Nespresso Aeroccino 4 for a while now and it’s one of those coffee add-ons that just does what you want without any fuss. Drop in milk, hit a button, and it turns out hot foam, cold foam, or just heated milk. The “max foam” and “max milk” lines make it hard to mess up, and it’s quiet enough that you can run it early without waking anyone.

Foam quality is legit. It handles whole milk, oat, and almond really well, with the denser foam mode giving you that cappuccino cap and the lighter one working for lattes. It pours cleanly too, no need to shake or spoon the foam out.

Cleaning is the best part, it is fully dishwasher safe. If you hand wash, the opening is a little tight, but a bottle brush solves it.

It is not cheap, but if you want consistent foam at the press of a button, this thing delivers. Great for turning a basic espresso or drip into something café-ish in about a minute.",2,1757424674.0,DecideWise,0,1.0,False

But I can wait a bit (using my switch for the rush mornings). 

I like to switch up recipes every now and the, so I think I’d like a machine like the Fellow Aiden or the xBloom Studio. 
While I mostly drink one cup at a time, and I do occasionally brew a larger volume for a travel mug or just to save a bit of time and have a few cups ready. This nudges the Aiden ahead. 

I’ve read a lot of the build quality issues on the Fellow sub, and seen a number of posts about the “add water” error and some app shortcomings. 

For those who have either or both Fellow and xBloom, I’d like to hear your thoughts? Has customer service been responsive and handled the Fellow issues well? I have not seen much problems with xBloom aside from some app stuff. 

My current thoughts are: 

-	buy an xBloom Studio and make a couple cups when I want a travel mug.
-	get the Fellow Ode gen 2 to save some time and effort for the grind now, keep using my manual pours and wait for an improved Aiden 
-	get the ode and Aiden and hope for the best",2,1757424666.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1nciwb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HairTransplants/comments/1nciwb7/i_dont_recommend_hairgo_clinic_turkey_estego/,"I don't recommend HairGo Clinic Turkey, EsteGo Clinic, BariatricGo Clinic, DentGo Clinic, and Go Clinic","All are operated by the same owners. So this feedback applies across the board — expect the same treatment at any of them.

I’m Brazilian, and if you’re considering getting a hair or beard transplant at HairGo Clinic — located at Namık Kemal, Sütçü İmam Cd. 28-34, 34762 Ümraniye/İstanbul, Turkey — I strongly suggest you reconsider. Unless, of course, you enjoy broken promises, rude behavior, procedures imposed without any discussion, and a post-op support team that vanishes into thin air. The experience is nothing short of traumatic.

Right upon arrival at the clinic, I was shocked by an outrageous attempt to charge me 20% more in euros, even though I had already paid the full amount via PIX transfer to the Brazilian representative, Ana Paula. It was a clear ambush attempt — meant to catch me off guard under pressure. I refused to pay, but that moment was the first red flag of the disaster to come.

The Turkish owners are Furkan Aslan and Burak Gülmez, and the clinic is formally operated under Again Turizm Sağlık Hizmetleri Tic. Ltd. Şti. In Brazil, I was assisted by the consultant Joana, who, after the surgery, referred me to their “director” Ana Paula (as she calls herself on the website). Joana was extremely friendly in the beginning and promised a symmetrical beard with full chin coverage — based on AI-generated images I had created. Spoiler: they completely ignored the chin area during surgery. Promises were made through images, messages, and voice notes. But of course, once everything went wrong, the tone changed:

""You approved this,""

""There’s no warranty in Brazil,""

""It’s not our fault,""

""Good luck with your €1,700 down the drain.""

The procedure took almost 10 hours and exposed me to serious risks: tachycardia, no translator, whispered conversations in another language, judgmental looks, and I wasn’t allowed to move — even with a herniated disc. Only after demanding a translator did one appear. Up until that point, a slab of meat at the butcher would’ve received more dignity.

Later, in an informal conversation over coffee with Joana, she shared even more disturbing stories: one patient, allegedly unable to pay, was accused of being a “scammer” and dragged into a room by henchmen; another story involved a clinic employee having sexual relations with a patient who had just undergone a major procedure. And they still expect me to fly back to Turkey for a “free revision”? Not a chance.

I tried to resolve everything peacefully. I sent photos, videos, and a full report to Ana Paula. The response? A long-winded legal threat, warning of prison time and lawsuits if I dared to share my experience publicly. This clinic claims to be international, yet behaves as if it’s above the law — or at the very least, above basic ethics, empathy, and accountability.

I’m attaching my full conversation with Ana Paula in this review — including screenshots, audios, and videos. Because transparency matters. If they tried to silence me through legal intimidation, it’s only fair that the public gets to decide based on the facts.

❌ I do NOT recommend this clinic under any circumstances.

Unless you're looking for an experience you’ll never forget — for all the wrong reasons.

My advice? Run. While you still can.

📌 MY RESPONSE TO HAIRGO’S LEGAL “WARNINGS” — CONSUMER RIGHTS MATTER

1. Freedom of speech is protected by law

Brazil’s Federal Constitution (Art. 5, IV, IX, XIV) protects real, documented personal testimonials. This is not a crime.

2. Complaining ≠ Defamation

According to Brazil’s Superior Court (REsp 1.635.428/SP), criticism based on real events — without gratuitous insults — is 100% legitimate.

3. Consumer rights are clear

Under the Brazilian Consumer Protection Code (Art. 6, III), I have the right to clear information and protection against abusive practices.

4. Public review + proof = legitimate

Posting screenshots, audio and video evidence is not defamation — it’s public service.

5. Sold in Brazil, liable in Brazil

Even if the clinic operates in Turkey, the person who sold, promised, and collected payment in Brazil is jointly liable (Art. 34, CDC).

📎 I’ve attached the entire conversation with Ana Paula, the so-called “Director” of the clinic in Brazil, as she refers to herself online.

Instead of huge awkward events, you link up with 2–6 people for low-key stuff… coffee, pickleball, volunteering, painting outside, whatever you’re into. Feels way less forced.

If this isnt the right subreddit for this, please let me know. I wrote this on mobile and tried my best to format it as clearly as I could.

Quick Backstory: In Late 2013, I was very, very pregnant with twins, but also known as ""the baker"" of my family. *I got super into those weirdly decorated cupcakes back then. You know, the ones that looked like corn-on-the-cobb or popcorn buckets?*

Anyway, my husband wanted ""something baked"" but we both knew I wasn't going to be able to function long enough to bake anything, so he went and started fumbling around the kitchen. He came out with what was first dubbed ""Miscuits"" but later called ""Buffins."" 

They. Were. So. Delicious. OMFG. 

[Please accept these two very grainy, old photos of the Buffin and Buffin crumble topping he created](https://imgur.com/a/qbxF6B5)

I never bothered to learn the recipe he used (or even ask) and I'm kicking myself now. Sadly, he died in a motorcycle accident in early summer 2015 and the recipe has since died with him. 

He wasn't insanely creative in the kitchen, but great at following directions. So I'm assuming he got it off the box and fiddled until it was good.

**What I do know/can be fairly certain of:**

-He used standard Bisquick (hence the ""Biscuit-Muffin"" name combo)

-He made a cinnamon/sugar coffee-cake like crumble for the top (definitely salted butter because that's all we ever had in the house most of the time)

-The crumble on top was flaky, not super crunchy, but that's where the sweetness was. It was definitely a cinnamon and sugar combo with salted butter.

-He used my extra large muffin/cupcake tins (the large ones that are six to a pan)

-The actual cake/muffin part tasted like a slightly denser, thicker, not as sweet coffee cake. It didnt have any sort of swirl of cinnamon/sugar like you get with coffee cakes or honey buns. IIRC, they really weren’t that sweet at all cake-wise, but they did clearly have some sugar in them. They were fluffy, but not light.

**If you've read this far and think you can help, thank you so much!**

Being able to bake these and eat them with our kids all these years later would be absolutely amazing; food is a great way to share memories and I'd love to give them a piece of their Dad via a ""Buffin"" again.

So one fine evening after a headache-giving lab, my friends and I, just for relief, ordered coffee at Tech Cafe...

When bhaiya called out our order, one of my friends and I went inside to pick up our cups...

But by God’s grace, when we turned around, you, my cutie panda, were drinking soda...

In nervousness, I bumped into you by mistake and spilled my cup on your T-shirt (of course, one of your boring T-shirts which you wear daily 😮‍💨)...

Out of concern about hurting you, I started crying, “Sorry,” and swept the spill with my bare hands...

But you are so gentle and kind-hearted, you held my hand and said, “It’s okay, don’t worry!! I am fine,” and blew on my hands with your gentle breath...

That cool breeze on my hands and face, our breaths chasing each other and playing hide and seek...

It’s such a magical moment; I was speechless and calm, enjoying the moment...

Then you offered to buy another cup for me. I hesitated a bit, but to your kind and gentle and cute request, I couldn’t deny, so I agreed...

You bought me another coffee and handed it to me. While holding my hands, you asked, “Whether we could have coffee where it’s just you and me under gazing stars”...

I shied away and hushed you with a nod...
Oh God, these thoughts are making butterflies fly in my stomach even when I am writing this ❤️...

However, with rnb and neo-soul I am more familiar with the artists and songs than their actual albums. I’m the type of person who would rather play albums in full the way people read books or watch movies. 


In summary, I am looking for preferably neo soul albums from the late 90s-2005. I don’t mind any rnb and soul albums from the 70s, 80s, or 90s as long as it has a fall vibe to it. I appreciate it.

# When my mental health takes a hit (stress, burnout, sadness, anxiety...), my oral health often goes downhill too.

Like:

* I start skipping brushing or flossing
* I drink more coffee and forget to hydrate
* My mouth feels dry all the time
* I just *stop caring* about routines that usually come naturally

Then, when I get back into good oral care habits, it somehow helps lift my mood, even if just a little. Almost like brushing, flossing, rinsing, etc. becomes part of me getting back in control. 🌀

So I’m really curious:  
👉 **Have you ever noticed a connection between your mental health and how well you take care of your mouth?**  
👉 Do things like stress, anxiety, or burnout affect your hygiene habits?  
👉 Or the other way around — does keeping up with dental care help you feel mentally sharper or more confident?

Ever feel like the 9-to-5 grind is stealing your soul? 😩 You wake up, chug a cup of coffee like it's a magic elixir, and rush out the door just to sit in a cubicle, staring at spreadsheets or the latest buzz about Sarah from HR. Sound familiar? 

Picture this: *You, casually sipping iced coffee at a beachside café, while your bank account mysteriously fills up with cash.* Yeah, that’s right! It’s time to ditch the daily slog and dive into the amazing world of AI tools to create some sweet side hustles (or maybe even your main gig)! Right? 

Let's chat about how to **cash in with AI** before the rest of the world catches on. Here’s how you can start your journey as a beginner creator: 

### 1. **Identify your passion**
   - What do you love? Writing? Designing? Podcasting? 
   - Think of something that excites you—because let’s face it, if you’re not having fun, why bother?

### 2. **Explore AI tools**
   - **For writing:** Tools like ChatGPT or Jasper can help you draft articles, blogs, or even social media posts in a snap! 
   - **For design:** Ever tried Canva powered by AI tools? It’s like having a personal graphic designer, minus the awkward small talk.
   - **For video and audio:** Look into tools like Descript for editing your next viral video easily. No need to spend hours in front of a screen—you’ll create it and sail off to do whatever else you love! 

### 3. **Create, create, create!**
   - Build your content! Don’t overwhelm yourself with perfection—just get it out there. 
   - Trust me, no one is judging you as harshly as you judge yourself. 

### 4. **Show it off**
   - Leverage social media. Share your work, connect with like-minded creators, and watch your network expand!
   - Have you heard about TikTok? That might just be the fastest-growing platform for creators. Just remember to *dance like no one’s watching* if you go that route. 💃 

### 5. **Monetize**
   - Affiliate marketing? Courses? Memberships? The possibilities are endless! 
   - A little creativity can lead to big payouts. Imagine getting paid for doing what you love. 🙌 

Okay, real talk. The world is changing fast, and AI is leading the charge. I mean, remember how email was once the wild frontier? Now it’s crucial for every business. Don’t get left behind! 

What’s your biggest fear about stepping out of that 9-to-5 rut? Or maybe you’re already grinding on something cool? Let’s hear about your AI faves! We’re all in this together. 💪✨",1,1757423638.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I had a panic attack last night! My first one since March. It definitely caught me by surprise- seems like it came out of nowhere. I stood up, felt a little dizzy, and that triggered an attack. Suddenly I felt like nothing was familiar, I felt very scared, my chest was very tight. My brain kept repeating “something is wrong. Something is wrong.” I was essentially freaking out in a matter of 2 minutes. 

So then, I did nothing. I took some deep breaths and said “okay, well, panic is here. What else can I focus on while my body dumps all this adrenaline out?” I let my partner know that I was feeling some high anxiety but I knew I’d be okay, I just had to ride it out. The adrenaline was making my body feel crazy- but I knew it was just that. Adrenaline.

I did some full body stretches and then just sat down and read a book. It took a little bit before my body returned to baseline. But it did. And that’s what I’ve learned over my 5 year anxiety journey- your body always returns to baseline. I was able to sleep through the night just fine, get up, make my coffee and reflect back on last night. Yes, it sucked. Yes, it isn’t fun and it is scary. Yes, my brain is slightly worried that I’m going to spiral back into panic attacks 24/7. My body may even feel weird and unfamiliar for the next few days!! But I don’t let anxiety dictate my life anymore. I’m not making my decisions based on anxiety anymore. I hope anyone else dealing with panic attacks and anxiety can keep moving forward and know that you will always be okay. Acceptance is the way forward!

Wishing you peace and progress today :)

# Today's check in:

What is something you can do to be kind to yourself today?

# Bonus exercise: Time in and Time Out

For many of us (me included!), binging and other unhelpful behaviours are used as relief from negative emotions. To move ourselves from ""I'm not binging but it's all I can think about"" to ""I'm not binging and I don't miss it either"", we need to find other ways to deal with those emotions.

There are two ways to deal with emotions: emotional regulation (""Time In"") and emotional discharge (""Time Out"").

\*\***The more you invest in Time In, the less often you're going to need those Time Outs.** Like everything, the more you maintain your emotional needs, the less often they’re going to need emergency care!!\*\*

**Time In is the things that we do** ***before*** **our emotions become overwhelming.** It's emotional maintenance. Time In includes things like:

* meditation (CoSaWe04)
* journaling
* listening to music
* reading (CoSaWe04)
* walking / yoga / swimming / running / other exercise (zodiahck, HappyVanillaBean, CoSaWe04, Future-Designer-6855, Anybody\_Minimum)
* maintaining friendships and spending time with loved ones (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Future-Designer-6855)
* eating delicious and nutritious food to sustain ourselves on a regular basis (not over-restricting!), and staying hydrated (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Future-Designer-6855)
* checking in with ourselves and paying attention to our feelings and needs
* coffee dates with ourselves (Anybody\_Minimum)
* checking in on loved ones / favourite people (zodiahck, Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* phone-free playtime with kids (MSH0123)
* listening to recovery podcasts (smokyoat)
* making sure to get enough sleep (guavatc, HappyVanillaBean)
* taking breaks from work or studies (guavatc)
* Colouring, Cross-stitching, General crafting (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* extended skincare routine, with scented candles and soft music (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Listening to audiobooks (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Reading something comforting, usually something I’ve read 100 times before! (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Planning engaging activities or routines (HappyVanillaBean)
* Arts and crafts (CoSaWe04, Anybody\_Minimum)
* oils on the pillow at night (Future-Designer-6855)
* food journaling (Future-Designer-6855)

**Time Out is the things we do when our emotions are high and we need to discharge them.** It's emotional 911. For most emotions, it usually takes about 20 minutes for discharge to occur (of course there will be exceptions, for example if someone you love has passed away you're not going to discharge those emotions in 20 minutes). Binging is a form of Time Out, a very effective one but also one that creates its own problems... More helpful types of Time Out include things like:

* more intense exercise (CoSaWe04)
* dancing
* crying
* venting (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Anybody\_Minimum)
* writing can also be a discharge activity
* screaming into a pillow
* taking a car ride with the windows down (MSH0123)
* driving or walking somewhere nice (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean)
* hot shower or bath (MSH0123, smokyoat, HappyVanillaBean, CoSaWe04, Anybody\_Minimum)
* DIY/hammering things! (apragopolis)
* vent art / memes (guavatc, Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* listening to angsty music (guavatc)
* a hot cup of tea (guavatc)
* watching comforting or funny youtube videos (guavatc, CoSaWe04)
* stomping around (apragopolis)
* watching something sad and having a good cry (smokyoat)
* therapy (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* getting into bed, sleeping or napping (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Anybody\_Minimum)
* aggressive cleaning, vacuuming, scrubbing (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* grabbing a refreshing drink (HappyVAnillaBean)
* reading (CoSaWe04)
* heated blanket (CoSaWe04)
* weighted blanket and essential oils (Anybody\_Minimum)
* fidget toys (Future-Designer-6855)
* look at pictures of loved ones (Future-Designer-6855)
* leave the situation (Future-Designer-6855)
* check in with a support group (Future-Designer-6855)
* duvet day (Anybody\_Minimum)

**So the exercise is:** What does your Time In and Time Out look like? Are there any that you are you willing to try (I'll add yours to the lists above!), and are there opportunities for more investment in Time In?

\----------------------------------

**WHAT IF I HAVE A SLIP DURING THE CHALLENGE?**

If you have a slip, [here is a link to the slip debrief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZhdjmzEVA6UTCNAEU53xn9LuN8TOfLbl/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100257616608241708100&rtpof=true&sd=true), which can help to turn the symptom into a learning opportunity. :)

Hi and Hola, Darla or Wolf 29 over here, this applies to both NA and SA since I speak fluently both languages. 

Jinglejingle Late Night, Jinglejingle Late night.

So please follow the rule of the night-time, I got a lot of people that really does not read that part specifically and reach out while our time does not match or people that say they do, but for some reason does not have the time in the end (supposedly, yeah bunch of liars) same reason I didn't answer some request at all.

To the point
I play a lot of games, gaming since 2002, but if we are talking about consistency at the moment:
Nightreing (getting ready for the ranked mode deep of night).
Gunfire reborn, really want anyone to play, it's not amazing, but it's fun.
Deadlock, my god i got hooked by it and even more by Bebop, Lash was right.
We can do 7 Days to die, No man sky (just got back into it), Valheim, V Rising ( started it for a few hours but want to play it coop honestly), if you want a competitive one then more so Rivals, left OW a while now, grounded 1 and 2, palworld, lord of the fallen and honestly more, even into friend-slops or whatever you want to call it, i also am a big fan of actuall horror game and survival horror is by far my favorite genre aside from dark fantasy, open to a lot of games and a lot of indies that you may want to try (lost castle 1/2, across the obelisk, whisper mountain outbreak, blightbound, more)

About me:
Introvert, Combined ADHD, BPD type 2, I can handle a extrovert if they can handle my switch from high to low energy, I like to be silly and serious at the same time and also like deep conversations when it happens or just silence when we just enjoy the time gaming and helping each other, im possibly on the spectrum wich would make a lot of sense, needs confirmation, you can be acting extremely goofy or as you like, we enjoy it, no discrimination, anyone is welcome.
I like Hard Rock, metal, Indies, mostly gaming OSTs, orchestra, some pop, some ambient and open to a lot you want to share too.
I would like to start going again to cons and try cosplay for the first time next year.
I'm an odd person honestly, can't help it, but hey, honesty.
Huge coffee enjoyer and starter connoisseur.
I enjoy games showcases and can't wait to see the bloodbath in this game awards at december.
Late night is my preference because I enjoy it, don't want to do it all the time of course, but as of now it has become almost full time since job got in the way, even if it changes back i still would do late night sessions, but not the entire week lol.
Please only reach out if you follow those terms, Late Night, full fledged gamer, I want to know someone that religiously follow games as I do, like a culture thingy.

It became a lifeline that helped me manage my anxiety.

My journey began in November 2022, just before my 36th birthday, when I discovered I had hydrosalpinx. After two rounds of IVF in the US, my baby girl was born in June 2024. I moved back to my home country at 34 weeks pregnant, and she arrived at 38+2.

By January 2025, with our daughter at seven months old, we started planning for a sibling. We had frozen embryos, but after digging into the stats on their poor grades, I wasn't feeling optimistic. I also weighed the cost and stress of traveling back to the US with a toddler, especially since our Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE) didn't sound confident either.

Previous Retrieval Results (US)
ER 1: 1 euploid (Day 5, 2BB)
ER 2: 3 euploid (Day 6, 4BB - chemical; Day 6, 4BB - live birth; Day 7, 5BB)

We decided to try a duostim cycle in my home country, a strategy I learned about from this very forum. I was skeptical that I'd produce higher-quality euploids, or any at all, but I wanted to try before it was too late. I started supplements—prenatal, Vitamin D, myo-inositol, 150mg of ubiquinol, and a probiotic—about three months before the retrieval. I also cut back on coffee and alcohol, while my partner rarely took his vitamins and enjoyed a whiskey most nights.

The results were astonishing, especially since I was two and a half years older than during my last retrievals.

Duostim Retrieval Results (Home Country)
ER 3: 1 euploid (Day 6, 5BB), 1 Day 5 low-level mosaic (5AA)
ER 4: 2 euploids (Day 5, 4AA; Day 6, 5AB), 1 Day 6 low-level mosaic (4AA), 1 Day 5 inconclusive (5AA)

So, what changed between ERs 1 & 2 and ERs 3 & 4, besides being 2.5 years older? I was simply less anxious. I even enjoyed a glass of wine here and there during stims. Now, I plan to give my body a much-needed break before the next implantation, as the duostim cycle took a toll.",4,1757423031.0,IVF,3,0.75,False

I watched my ex-husband buy a four-bedroom house last week while I'm washing my hair in my cousin's kitchen sink because her shower broke.

Three years ago, I was the one with everything. Good job, stable marriage, two kids who adored me. But I was bored out of my mind. Every day was the same. Wake up, pack lunches, work, dinner, help with homework, sleep. My husband would fall asleep watching sports highlights at 9 PM. I felt like I was slowly dying.

Then this guy started at my office. Younger, exciting, always talking about his weekend trips to casinos and clubs. He'd lean against my desk and tell me I was wasting my best years playing house. ""You could have so much more,"" he'd say. ""You deserve adventure.""

I believed him.

The affair started fast. Hotel rooms during lunch breaks. Texting all night while my husband snored beside me. My coworker introduced me to his lifestyle. First, it was just weekend trips to the casino. Then poker games. Then online betting. Everything felt electric. The risk, the thrill, the complete opposite of my predictable life.

""I can't do this anymore,"" I told my husband one Tuesday morning. Just like that. No warning. He was holding his coffee mug, and his hand started shaking. ""What do you mean?"" he asked. But I was already packing.

My kids cried. My daughter wouldn't let go of my leg. My son, only seven, kept asking if he did something wrong. I told them I'd see them every other weekend. I told myself they'd understand when they were older.

I moved in with my coworker. For six months, it was everything I wanted. We'd blow through my savings at blackjack tables. Stay up until 4 AM. Order room service. Live like there was no tomorrow.

There was a tomorrow.

He cleaned out our joint account and disappeared when I was at my mother's funeral. Left a note saying he met someone who ""wasn't so heavy with baggage."" I owed forty thousand to various creditors. My credit cards were maxed. I'd even borrowed against my 401k.

My ex-husband got remarried last year. Some teacher from our kids' school. She's pretty. Kind. My kids call her Mom now because I missed too many visitations while I was in gamblers anonymous. Then rehab. Then working three jobs to pay off debt collectors.

I see their Christmas photos on social media. My ex lost weight. He smiles different now. Real smiles. Their new house has a pool. My daughter's birthday party had a bounce house and thirty kids. I wasn't invited.

My cousin lets me stay on her pullout couch. I work overnight stocking shelves and do food delivery during the day. Every penny goes to debt. I eat ramen most nights. Sometimes I walk past my old house, the one where my kids used to live. There's a young family there now. They painted it yellow.

Last week I broke down and called my ex. Asked if I could see the kids for Christmas. ""They have plans,"" he said. His voice was polite but cold. ""Maybe after New Years.""

I hung up and stared at the water stain on my cousin's ceiling. Three years ago, I had everything and threw it away for excitement. Now my ex has the life I thought I was too good for, and I'm googling bankruptcy lawyers on my cracked phone.

They study their features, copy their messaging, and try to match their pricing.

But here's the problem: when you compete on their strengths, you're playing their game.

The Restaurant That Changed the Rules

The 50th-best restaurant in the world wanted to climb the rankings. So the owner visited the #1 restaurant.

His team focused on what the top restaurant did better: perfect napkins, flawless presentation, impeccable scripts.

But the owner flipped it: ""Let's focus on where they're not paying attention.""

They found two overlooked areas:

*   Coffee was just… fine
    
*   Beer drinkers were completely ignored
    

Instead of improving their already-good wine service, they appointed a coffee sommelier and a beer sommelier.

Two simple changes that no other restaurant was doing.

Result? They moved significantly higher in the rankings.

Your Real Opportunity

Your competitive advantage isn't where you think.

You're probably strong where your competition is also strong.

Your real opportunity is in the spaces they're ignoring:

*   What does every company in your space do poorly?
    
*   Where do customers have low expectations?
    
*   What part of the experience does everyone treat as an afterthought?
    

The SaaS Version

Instead of building better dashboards (everyone has good dashboards), focus on:

*   Onboarding that doesn't suck
    
*   Support that actually helps
    
*   Pricing that makes sense
    

These aren't sexy features, but they're where most SaaS companies fail.

The Bottom Line

Don't try to be 10% better at what your competition does well.

Be 100% different at what they ignore.

1nci9u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1nci9u5/find_out_if_the_best_electric_kettle_from_aroma/,Find Out if the Best Electric Kettle from AROMA Is Worth It,"**Sleek Yet Functional Design**

From the moment I unboxed the AROMA AWK-1810SD electric kettle, I could tell its stainless steel design was visually appealing and built to last. The brushed finish on the steel not only resists smudges but also subtly reflects light, making it fit seamlessly into any kitchen environment. Its compact dimensions (8.63""L x 5.75""W x 9.63""H) mean it doesn’t hog counter space, even in smaller kitchens like mine. The cordless body is a lifesaver when you’re pouring hot water—no cumbersome cords getting in the way. As a lightweight two-pound setup, I appreciated how easy it was to move it around whenever I reorganized the counter. 

**Ease of Use and Customization**

What caught my attention was the digital control panel on this kettle. Having never used a programmable kettle before, I was surprised at how intuitive the controls felt. Adjusting the precise temperature was simple, and I could customize it for whatever I needed—whether it was tea, oatmeal, or instant noodles. The Keep Warm mode is a game-changer, especially when I’m multitasking. If you’ve ever stepped away and come back to water that’s cooled off, this feature saves you the frustration. It maintains the desired temperature for up to an hour. Perfect for colder mornings when multiple cups of tea are a necessity.

**Perks**

- Digital controls make precise temperature management straightforward.
- Lightweight and cordless design ensures effortless serving and maneuvering.
- The Keep Warm feature maintains optimal water temperature for an hour.
- A high 1500-watt capacity allows for rapid boiling.

[Check AROMA AWK-1810SD price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b09zkhhky8/)

**Performance and Speed**

One of the first things I tested was boiling speed. With 1500 watts of power, this kettle brings water to a boil rapidly—easily outpacing boiling water on a stovetop. It’s a time-saver for anyone with a busy morning routine. I found the automatic shut-off feature dependable, offering an added layer of safety when I’m rushing out the door. No guesswork or risk of overheating here. My tea enthusiast friend swears by the removable tea filter, which works smoothly for loose-leaf tea. Cleanup? Easy as pie—detach the filter, rinse, and you’re set. 

**Shortcomings**

- There’s noticeable noise during boiling, which might be bothersome in quieter environments.
- While the tea filter is great, it doesn’t sit snugly when brewing very fine teas.

**Sustainability and Maintenance**

This kettle is designed with longevity in mind. The stainless steel interior not only feels durable but also resists wear and tear better than models I’ve had previously with plastic interiors. The product care instructions recommend hand washing, which I don’t mind since the interior smoothness means minimal scrubbing. Hidden within the base is a storage compartment for the cord—this seemed like a small feature until I realized how neat it kept my counter. When it comes to saving energy, the automatic shut-off and rapid boiling mean you’re not wasting electricity unnecessarily.

**Competing Products**

In comparison to other electric kettles, like models from Cuisinart or Breville, the AROMA AWK-1810SD holds up remarkably well in function, but it’s more affordable without compromising basic usability. For instance, while Breville kettles offer additional brewing presets, those come at a higher price point and rarely feel essential unless you’re extremely particular about brewing techniques. I’ve noticed plastic kettles in a similar price range tend to lack both the sturdiness and aesthetic appeal of this model, making the stainless steel body a superior choice.

**Cost Efficiency**

After using this kettle daily for weeks, I’d argue it delivers great quality for the price. Given the durable materials, high-speed performance, and extra temperature controls, you won’t feel like corners were cut at this price point. Comparing it to stovetop kettles in terms of efficiency, the programmable features alone add significant value. For anyone who regularly brews tea, makes pour-over coffee, or even preps hot meals, this is a practical and worthwhile kitchen appliance.

Let's start!

I have a best friend let's call her Lila. Lila and i were friends since elementary school me and her are really close I always come by to Thier house to eat lunch and etc. her parents treated me like Thier own. Were So close  that even I get involved in their family problems here dad cheats her mom vents to me all the classics and Lila is the only child.. well a year later her mom and dad divorced, only her dad moved away, they never talk about him anymore. 

Fast forward when we were in highschool I got a boyfriend let's call him Leo, Lila didn't like Leo at first but she eventually warm up to him, when me and Leo would hang out she would tag along it was sweet at first but I started noticing them growing closer... Like really close sometimes I catch them laughing having a fun conversation without me. And I started noticing a pattern. Lila became distant like when I simply as if we can hang out she would say shes busy doing house chores but I know her enough now she never does house chores in fact shes actually pretty lazy ngl I started suspecting that leo was cheating on me with Lila but didn't have proof. Eventually I one day I was walking to the park ALONE cuz my bf is busy doing something god knows what and I saw them HAVING A FUCKING PICNIC I snapped a few pictures and confronted them they denied at first but eventually confessed.. same day I broke up with Leo cut ties with Lila and decided to start fresh. 

I was drinking coffee in my apartment when I noticed my phone keeps on buzzing with text. Lila's dad added me and started a conversation he wasn't what I expect, he went from a farmer to a company CEO yes C-E-O.
he's ex family didn't know that he messaged me asking hows my day something² until eventually we needed up talking all day and he made me happy days turned into months and months turn into years until I didn't notice time has come fast and well...me and Lilas dad ended up having a relationship romantically, he would pick me up and go to places I never went.

One time when me and Lilas dad let's call him Jhon, we went out every now and then he buys me gift... Mind you he's 28 years older than me but he treats me like I'm he's treasure (ngl hes very good in bed too hehe) 
One year into our relationships Lila messages me asking me how's my life going on and ask if I wanted to come on our class reunion, I agreed immediately and the next week I ask Jhon if he can drive me to my class reunion and agreed without hesitation and the next day we went to my class reunion Lila and Leo ended up breaking up because Leo cheated on her   lol not surprised but what's surprising is when she realized the guy who's driving me calling me ""love"" was her father, I smiled at her and moved on with my day. That was the sweetest revenge I got HAHAHAHAH

that's all and yes I'm still with jhon but don't worry I'm not using him for his money or something, I genuinely love him and we're actually expecting a little one in the next 3 months ",1,1757422232.0,u_dalienext,0,1.0,False

1nchxf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/comments/1nchxf0/mkoi_sergio_ferra_main_valorant_cc_tldr_on_the/,MKOI Sergio Ferra (main valorant cc) TLDR on the whole VCT debacle,"Sergio Ferra is the main MKOI Valorant content creator (also a Spanish football league commentator). He was in charge of costreaming both the VCT and the Spanish league games. He just came back from his holiday week, that's why he's addressing only this now. 

TLDR:

1. After Ibai announced he was distancing himself from streaming due to health and mental issues, Riot indeed did contact MKOI's management last January inquiring what would happen with the costreaming he was part of. This is what some people has refered as the ""first warning"".

2. MKOI replied to Riot and sent several presentations and documents where it was detailed and explained who would be in charge of the costreamings instead, everything was backed with statistics and plenty of data. Regarding the VCT costream, it was specified Ibai would participate in the costreams (which he did) alongside Sergio in the latter's channel. 

3. Sergio briefly explains why he was confused after the announcement. Apparently in July, he had a meeting with Riot Spain, who went on to congratualte his costream, praise his work and highlight how his work as been key to the whole community. 

4. In May, Riot EU went to visit MKOI's main HQ and had coffee with the MKOI guy in charge there. MKOI was again praised for their league roadtrip event, argued about future plans and lots of different things. Apparently, the ""second and final warning"" happened during this coffee talk, when something along the lines of ""so about the val capsules, not good numbers sadly, you need to wake up okey?"". 

5. Ibai was never contacted by Riot directly until the last moment when he was notified MKOI was being kicked from VCT.

6. Sergio highlights how the decision must have been made last week in a haste because he knew the MKOI classic had been on the works and was being polished until very recently.

7. MKOI academy team was denied playing the Ascension because according to Riot they were not considered the main team until the 6th of September. Despite becoming the main team, Riot considers all their achievements under the ""academy"" banner, hence why they are not eligible for Ascension. Sergio agrees with Riot's stand and finds this a shitty situation but an understandable one.

8. Sergio now lengthly addresses how Riot treats Spanish CCs in general. He starts off saying Riot doesn't care at all about any Spanish CCs, not even Mixwell. This has been verbally confirmed by basically every CC so not much new info here. He then goes on to explain how he spent 3 years asking Riot for a clean feed since he started costreaming. Never got any answer. Then, the last month of games he was finally sent one. The reason? Apparently GM and KC recently complained about the same issue and after backreading Sergio's several emails, he was also sent one alongside the other two clubs. He goes on to mention several minor issues that support his initial claim but not much more worth mentioning (for example, the fact that the only time Riot contacted him for something official was for a VCT video which portrayed him so bad that he consequently got a ton of hate from Heretics fans) .

Hi, I’m 23 (F) and I’ve been single for almost 5 years now. I had a boyfriend back in high school until college, but he got someone pregnant and after that, I never had another relationship. Honestly, I also never really felt interested in anyone since then.

But I get small crushes sometimes—like “cute lang siya” type of crush, pero it fades in a few weeks. I think it’s more of just being attracted to looks, then I lose interest. I also don’t really chat with anyone or entertain people online. I don’t know if I’m just too busy, not really likeable, or maybe my standards are just high hahaha.

Sometimes though, I wonder how it feels to have someone to rant to at night about work, or someone to spend weekends with—like coffee dates or just having a partner-in-crime aside from family. But at the same time, I’m not rushing since I’m still young. I just get curious sometimes how it feels to have that “someone” again who really understands you.

Idk, I feel a bit confused… is this normal?

I got to a healthy point and my friend (whom was unaware of my disordered eating) just told me, ”wow you look normal now” and I had to pause and be like, ”okay, I gotta stop now before it escalates”.

I have tried to identify my triggers, I know them. But what helped me the past two days were 

1. A set breakfast. Nothing sweet. I love eggs and bread so thats my go-to.

2. Protein bars. Why did I never eat these before? It seriously made me so, not full per say but full from the protein, almost nauseous. Like my urge to grab whatever else just… dropped. They taste good in the moment and then really linger for hours.

3. Coffee.

4. Walking w loud music. Doesn’t feel excessive but it’s a nice distraction.

Honestly I haven’t been happier. I gotta remind myself that this lifestyle made me happy, not the constant eating. I actually look forward to what this being kept up consistently will do to me.",2,1757421759.0,BingeEatingDisorder,1,0.75,False

I bought a Bambino plus from Amazon replacing my trusty gaggia classic 2004 as the boiler was clogging all time and various other things needed replacing. I bought the Bambino plus as something a little more automated and Im making mainly milk drinks . I was kinda happy, automated frothing made life much easier, programmable shots, 9bar all seemed good. Only thing was for the life of me I couldn't get rid of channeling, coffee spraying everywhere from the sage open basket I added. I tried all the puck prepping etc. Then it had a problem as it would not let me cancel the annoying back flush descale that comes after 200 shots, always happens making a coffee then it won't let you finish by steaming the milk.despite trying all the buttons combinations recommended.

I contacted support who confirmed the problem and they replaced it without any hassle at all. Yes I was still in the gaurentee period but I was really pleased with the excellent service from Gloria at sage appliances support. The best thing is the replacement is way better than the first machine which must have had other issues. This machine performs as it should I can pull much better shots even with the open basket, hardly any channelling, spraying when prepped right,so really pleased with the Bambino plus for my needs at a decent price point highly recommended.",2,1757421588.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1nchqhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1nchqhy/why_was_cleopa_ilie_canonised_when_he_was_a/,Why was Cleopa Ilie canonised when he was a legalist?,"His [confession manual](https://sfcuvioasaparascheva.com/indreptar_pentru_spovedanie.html), a list of sins for people wanting to confess, is not only not condemned, but propagated in several Romanian Orthodox parish websites as well as being printed in books. And obviously, he never repented for such legalism!

Some of the worst entries include, but are not limited to:

* \#43. Drinking ""a lot"" of coffee is sin (and what about the whole concept of ""coffee hour""?)
* \#47. Going to the beach/pool is sinful
* \#96. Not completely fasting every Monday (or any of the other fasts) means you are cursed (keep in mind, this is a manual for *laypeople*, not monks)
* \#108. Did you see your parents naked when you were a child? Sin.
* \#144, #380. Winking, laughing, and clapping are all sins (What the heck???)
* Annex. Suicide is the unforgiveable sin (despite Church tradition having stories of people repenting from it miraculously, such as repenting whilstcommitting it)
* Annex. Telling a ""small lie"" incurs an excommunication of 1 year

This VERY strict adherence to church canons/penances (some of which were seemingly invented by Cleopa himself, ex. the coffee) was something St. Nektarios of Aegina also did in his early confessor years, and he later condemned himself for doing so, even calling it a sin (how ironic!)

As you read through the manual, you may notice his obsession with assigning an arbitrary large number of prostrations every day for years (e.g. 160, 366, etc.) and the number of years in the excommunications. At the bottom of the page, it's also said these years can be ""deducted"" through more asceticism (scoring points and using multipliers, almost like a game!)

As well, he also condemned children born during Pascha to **death** (in [his heavily exaggerated retelling](https://deasaimpartasirecunevrednicieosandavesnica.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/despre-nestiutele-judecati-ale-lui-dumnezeu-pr-ilie-cleopa-12/) of a John Moschus story, itself already somewhat crazy)

I'm not coming here to troll, I genuinely want an explanation as to why he is considered a ""most venerable"" saint and ""great modern elder"" when he has written something so legalist, even the most radtrad of Traditionalist Catholics can't compete. Obviously, this manual is mostly unheard of outside of Romania, and itself is rarely used there, although obviously is still published, **with the blessing of the bishop**.

Finally, this brings a dilemma: either Cleopa is right in everything he wrote in his manual, and most of Orthodoxy is apostate for not using it, or else Cleopa was being a very cruel legalist and this confession manual must be added to the list of heretical books.

**TL;DR:** Cleopa Ilie should not have been canonised due to his abundant legalism, something condemned by modern saints, such as St. Nektarios.",0,1757421434.0,OrthodoxChristianity,35,0.4,False

When we met for coffee he started to be emotional and cried a bit. We then went for a little walk talked about whats new in our lifes just catching up a little. 
After what felt like an hour we went to talk to private. 
He told me that he thinks I deserve someone that can give me what I gave into this relationship. Like he feels like I invested so much into it and he is not capable of giving me the same and he doesnt want to hold me back. He said that he cannot imagine anyone else at my spot as his future spouse or someone that he could live his life with. He said that currently he doesnt want to be in relationship and he needs to be alone. 
He cried for the whole time we talked and I just cannot get over the feeling that what he said doesnt correspond with what he thinks or feels. 
I am now stuck as I dont want to move on because I know that once I shut the door there is no chance of opening it again. I am hurting as we were supposed to move in in few months and were talking about wedding and future. 
Yes I mentioned during our relationship that I sometimes dont feel enough or that he doesnt make me his priority but I said that its just small things like when he is late for hours he could atleast call or write a text or something just let me know. It was the small things. But anytime something big happend he always showed up and been there. I never said that he doesnt care about me just that the little things were missing out. 
Im just confused and dont know what to think or do. 
Also he still had our pictures as his backround on the phone.",4,1757420823.0,BreakUps,0,0.84,False

1nchgtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nchgtm/toys_part_iii/,TOYS Part III,"I didn’t sleep that night.

After I was sure Win was out, I crept into the closet – making sure not to wake up Jess. My heart was pounding, my breathing hard and fast, and I didn’t want to scare her.

I was scared enough for the both of us.

We had some of our things stacked in boxes toward the back of the closet – old, unnecessary things consolidated to a few boxes. I had meant to take them up to the attic, that new shared and secret space, but just hadn’t gotten around to it yet. I was glad I hadn’t because the thought of creeping up those narrow stairs into the still, hot dark up there after what had just happened seemed unbearable.

One of the boxes had a bunch of Win’s baby things. Old bottles, a well-used maternity pillow, some of Win’s baby toys she had moved on from – all of them were stuffed into a box labeled ‘Someday’. We’d been saving them, of course, with the thought that maybe we’d need them again; someday. A sweet wish we were banking on for the future.

I ripped the tape off the top of the box, a little too loud. I winced, looking back through the closet to the edge of the bed, watching Jess’s feet in case she stirred and kicked. But she was still, and even from the insulated quiet of the closet I could hear her deep, rhythmic breathing.

I rummaged through the box, my hands clumsy in the dark – forgotten shapes playing against my imagination. I knew what I was looking for, and after some digging my fingers brushed against a length of cord. A hard, plastic shape. I pulled it all free.

It was Win’s baby monitor. A small black camera, the power chord snaking around the aperture. I stuffed it into the pocket of my pajama pants, walking carefully around the spots in the floor I knew would creak and back out of the closet.

As I stood in the doorway, I heard it.

A long, slow creeaaak.

This wasn’t the timid, hesitant sound I’d heard before. This was drawn-out, deliberate – ending with a low, hollow thunk, like the lid meant to shut itself. Like it meant to be heard.

I froze. The shape of the second-floor unspooled in my mind: the hall stretching to Win’s room, the nook, the box in the corner.

creeaaak. thunk.

Again – measured, almost playful.

My pulse skittered. I thought of her jaw clicking last night, her wide, glassy eyes. The cold tooth in my palm. I felt my forehead break out in sweat at the thought of it – that frigid pebble of a molar.  

I walked down the hall as silently as the carpet allowed, feeling the darkness lean toward me. Lick at me. The creaking stopped as I reached her door.

I eased it open.

The room glowed in the faint, amber haze of her nightlight. Win was a bundled shape on the bed, her face turned toward the wall. The toybox sat still and shut within the nook, as if it hadn’t moved in years.

But I knew better. I was learning to be better.

I pulled the monitor from my pocket, unwinding the cord. I worked by memory, crouching in the far corner of the room – away from the bed, away from the box. Out of sight, my mind whispered, out of sight.

I found an outlet and jammed the cord in. The red light blinked on. I angled the lens toward both the toybox and the bed, making sure they fit together in the frame. Then – standing, holding my breath – I backed out of the room.

On the other side, back in safer dark of our room, I took out my phone. I downloaded the monitoring app and logged back into our account. It took a moment for the camera to start streaming live to me but when it did…

I saw Win, still and tucked away in her blanket. I saw the room, the night vision switching on as soon as the camera felt how dark the room was. I saw the nook -- the dark little threshold in the far wall.

And inside, the edge of the toybox.

I settled next to Jess as softly as I could, as careful as the bed springs as I was of the floorboards, rolling over on my side, hugging my phone close to me. I checked the app every few minutes like I was pressing on a bruise to make sure it still hurt. My little portal into Win’s room, a window to peek through. The toybox was still, a window to peek through. Static shimmered across the shadowed wood, making it seem alive, squirming.

And there, eyes wide in the dark, I waited. I watched.

**

“What are you doing?”

I jolted, half-asleep, spilling cold coffee over the edge of the mug. I was sitting at the kitchen table, hunched forward in my seat. My phone in my other hand, close to my face.

Too close, I guessed, from the way Jess was looking at me.

“Hello?” she asked. Her arms were crossed in front of her, and she nodded her head toward my phone. “What’s that?”

“Just work,” I said, sliding my hand and the phone with it under the edge of the table and into my lap. I’d been checking the feed since dawn, over and over, and I’d had to have my phone plugged in ever since I got up out of our bed a few hours to charge. I brought the mug to my lips, taking a sip. Wincing at the flat, cold flavor.

“Yeah,” Jess said, turning around. She was portioning snacks – carrots and apple slices and yogurt pouches. A juicebox.

I frowned.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

Jess didn’t turn around.

“Packing a bag,” she said, stuffing the goods into the plastic grocery bag.

“Yeah, I can see that,” I said, sitting up a little in my chair, a dull pain settling in my lower back, “but why?”

Jess dropped her hands on the counter. I saw her shoulders slump, saw her head roll back just the barest few inches. Inches enough for me. I felt my heart kick up in my chest.

“For Mom’s?” she said, half-turning her head to me. I could see the side of her eye, her lips drawn tight.

“For Mom’s,” I repeated, closing my eyes.

Of course. Jess had told me last week we’d be going to see her parents this weekend. They lived two hours away, they were well off in their retirement, and they spoiled Win at every chance they got. The thought of her coming home with some fresh toys, something new and good? It was a relief, it was a balm to the unease throbbing in the center of me.

“I’m sorry,” I said again after a moment, opening my eyes again – a slow struggle, “I know I’ve been…”

“We’re leaving in an hour,” Jess said, grabbing the bag. Cinching it shut and turning toward me.

I met her eyes. I tried to smile. Wondering, idly, if I looked as sick as I felt.

Jess softened. She didn’t return the smile, not quite. But her body relaxed, her free hand easing the neck of her bathrobe. Rubbing her collarbones – drifting tickling fingers along their ridges. It was a small gesture of self-comfort, automatic, and one I knew well. In that moment I wanted so very badly to stand up, cross the distance between us in the kitchen, and wrap my hands around her waist – to take her hand, hug her close, and whisper how much I loved her right into the dip of her shoulders. To wish in her well.

I blinked, my eyes suddenly watering. Jess smiled, and this time I’m sure what she saw reflected back on my face was genuine. It was the real chord of our love, thrumming through us – what brought us together, what made Win, what made sharing this life and this house so beautiful.

A secret, smiling note between us that – in the bare seconds of that moment – felt like it could fill the house. One that could amplify all of the light of everything good we had here and push back the shadows.

I stayed at the kitchen table longer than I needed to, just watching her move. The soft hum of the fridge, the faint shift of the house above us – like something settling deeper into place. Her presence felt… steady. It was something I could hold onto.

“Want to get the girl?” Jess said, walking by me and pausing where I sat. Laying her hand on my shoulder. Squeezing once. It felt like home should.

I wiped my eyes, nodding. I heard Jess walk on behind me – out the kitchen and up the stairs. When I was sure she was gone, I thumbed shut the close button on my phone. I stood up, stretching, and tried to keep that lingering moment with me.

Then, with a sigh that turned into a shaking yawn, I turned around myself and started up the stairs. Toward Win’s room.

**

I walked past our room, smiling to myself as I heard Jess humming deeper inside as she got dressed. The sun was up and full as I came to Win’s door – streaming through the window upstairs, washing the still-bare walls in warm gold. Win’s door was closed, Win’s door was closed – a habit she picked up after potty training; she always closed the door on the way back into her room if she had to get up in the middle of the night for some reason. I reached for the handle and pressed my ear to the wood, listening for the sounds of my girl sleeping.

Nothing.

I eased the door open.

Win’s bed was empty. Blankets a messy coil at the foot, pillow almost bare.

Except for Milkshake. Except for fucking Milkshake.

The room didn’t have any of the warmth from the outside hall. It felt… hollow. Empty.

I took a slow step inside, shutting the door again, my eyes sweeping the room. I didn’t see Win’s new doll anywhere – that one didn’t have a name yet and I was glad of it. Hoping she’d forget about it, hoping she wouldn’t latch on to it like she had that ashen snake. It would be so much easier to take that way – to get rid of.

creeaaak

My gaze shot to the nook. The toybox was open, its black lid angled back.

For a moment, I didn’t understand what I was seeing—two small legs, pajama cuffs bunched at the ankle, feet hooked over the edge. Half my daughter’s body – inside the gaping mouth of that shadow thing. The rest of her vanished inside.

“Win.” My voice came out flat, too quiet.

No answer.

I dashed across the room and grabbed her around the waist. She twisted in my arms, immediately struggling, small hands clutching something to her chest. I gasped, surprised, and tried to keep my grip on her.

“Let go!” she shrieked, writhing. “LET GO.”

“Win, stop. STOP,” I said, finding myself screaming as I yanked her back and out of the nook. I felt what she was holding on to pressing against me, a lump of cold and wet. It was repulsive, and in the dreamy scramble of the moment the first thought that lit up my mind was that it was dead, that it was a dead thing Win had and she was squeezing it so tight against herself.

“Drop it baby,” I said, my mouth going dry, “drop it now, what…what is that?”

Win’s eyes shot to mine. Her face was flushed, eyes bright. She wailed, her arms going limp as she started to cry, sloping against my shoulder. I held her closer to me, an entirely different sting of tears welling in my eyes.

Win dropped the thing. I felt it land on my bare feet, and I gasped. And, I hate myself very much for admitting this – but my first reaction was to drop Win, after feeling the way that frigid lump felt against the tops of my bare feet. It was lizard instinct, the kind that knows to run when you see a shadow creeping up behind you out of the corner of your eye.

But Dad instincts won. I squeezed Win tight, stepping around the thing and away from the nook. 

The toybox lid slammed shut.

I moaned. My heart was throbbing, my guts wrung. Win held on tight to me, pressing her face against me, her wails rising as I spun around to look at the box.

It was silent. Eerie. Still.

I heard footsteps pounding down the hall – Jess. I hugged Win tighter, burying my face in her hair.

“Shhh, shh,” I said, my own voice shaking, “it’s okay, daddy’s here. I’m here, I’m with you, I’m here.”

I repeated my litany as the door to Win’s room shuddered in its frame.

“Robert? What’s going on?”

I could hear Jess on the other side of the door, see the knob rattling. I heard her grunt before she gave three short slamming knocks.

“ROBERT.”

Had I closed the door? I moved to open it, breathing hard, when my foot brushed the thing on the floor once more.

I recoiled, feeling bile sluice up my throat even before I laid eyes on the thing. I looked down, expecting to see something rotten and awful, something that should never be in my daughter’s room. I stared, struck dumb and disgusted, down at the lump on the floor.

It was, of course, a toy. A new toy, one I’d never seen before – and larger than the others. Its body was lopsided, stitched from mismatched fabric: faded doily webbings, shredded silks, threadbare linens. All of them separate shades of grey, a bouquet of ash. The shape of the thing was uneven, and I couldn’t tell if the fabric was supposed to be a dress or a shirt or a blouse. It looked – half-finished.

My mind retched the word: undigested.

The thing had two button eyes, one missing, leaving only a frayed circle of thread. The one that remained, however, was smoke-white and glassy. Staring down at the thing, I almost thought I saw myself reflected in its haze.

“What the hell is GOING ON?!” I heard Jess shout, from the hallway.

Hearing her voice, the strain, the horrible rise in pitch at the end, broke me out of my shock. I reached for the door in a rush, turning the knob. Hearing the lock click as I swung it open.

Jess was on the other side, her face almost as red as Win’s.

“Whathappenedwhathappened,” she said, twice and fast, slurring her words together. She was already stepping in the room, reaching for Win. Taking her from me.

I reached for her, the same way I’d wanted to reach for the warmth in the kitchen hours ago — but this time she twisted away, her back to me. The box creaked behind her, long and low, a settling groan.

Like it was breathing.

I let Jess take Win from me, my gaze shifting back to the thing on the floor. The cyclopean bundle.

“What is that baby,” I heard myself say, before I realized I was speaking.

Win’s face was buried in Jess’s shoulder, and she raised it, her face twisted with anger and confusion.

“It’s mine,” she said, breathless. “It was in the hallway.”

My mouth went dry. “What hallway? What?”

She didn’t answer – just hugged Jess tighter, her cheek pressing into her mother’s neck.

“Jess, I…”

But Jess just looked at me. Something unreadable in her stare. I felt it shrivel me, and suddenly all the menace in the room was gone. I felt empty, confused and dumb.

“you’re acting in-sane,” Jess hissed.

I opened my mouth to reply, but Jess stepped out of the room, barreling down toward the other end of the hallway. Back to our room.

I turned around to glance once more at the toybox before following them. The shadows underneath the chitinous wood were deeper than they should have been in the spilling daylight, pooling and oily at the bottom. I glared at it, waiting for it to open, waiting for it to creak.

But there was nothing. Once again, the fucking thing was still.

**

By the time I came downstairs, Jess was in the entryway, kneeling in front of Win and buttoning a dress up the girl’s back – it was nice, almost too nice; floral print and pressed smooth. Win hadn’t worn it since Easter. Win was struggling to try and get the dress off, heavy-salted tears still lying fat and swollen on her face.

A small overnight bag sat open on the bench, half-filled with Jess’s clothes. The plastic snack bag was next to it, and beside that too were Jess’s toiletries.

There was nothing of mine.

Win whined, a pitiful little cry, and slumped down on the entryway wall as I came close. Jess froze, her face locked in a scowl. She watched me from the corner of her eye, standing up slowly.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

Jess gesticulated with both of her hands in front of her – an inferred ‘duh’.

“I’m taking her to my parents. Alone.,” she said, her tone already hard.

“Jess –”

“What the hell was that? I mean, she’s shaking, Rob. She’s scared out of her mind.”

“She was in the box,” I said. “Halfway inside.”

“It’s a toybox.” Jess zipped the bag with one sharp pull. “Not a trapdoor. Not some – ”

“You didn’t see it.” I stepped closer. “The way she was in there. The way she was holding that thing, I mean, it felt disgusting…”

“What felt disgusting?”

“The toy,” I said, “the…thing she had.”

“It’s a toy, Robert. She’s a kid. Kids play. You’re the one turning it into some something, something it isn’t ever going…” She stopped herself, glanced at Win, lowered her voice. “You’re scaring her.”

I looked at Win. She stared back, peeking up through her bangs which had spilled loose over her head. Her eyes were shiny and wet, her lip trembling.

I wanted to go to her. I wanted to scoop her up into my arms and hold her. I wanted to apologize to her a hundred thousand times with a hundred thousand kisses all over her head. I wanted to take the fear I had put into her, siphon it out, and remove every hard thought flowing through her head.

I wanted her Daddy to make it all better. But Jess stepped between the two of us, reaching a hand down for Win’s. Our daughter took it, -- standing up and locked eyes with me once more.

“It’s mine,” she said softly, almost a whisper.

Jess stroked her hair. “I know, honey. We’re just going to go see Grammie and Grandpie for a little while.”

But Win was still looking at me, clutching the edges of her dress and pulling it up over her knees. Her voice was steady now:

“It’s not for you,” she said.

The words slit their way into my mind. I stood still, meeting Win’s gaze. She stared through me. And even then, even in that moment and knowing what was coming, it felt like there was no one else in the entryway but the two of us.

Jess stood, sweeping Win close as she opened the door. She picked up our girl with one hand while the other looped though the bags’ handles. A late summer gust rushed in, filling the entryway with hot, bitter warmth. The air wet like breath.

“Don’t follow us,” she said. “Just… let us breathe for the day. Take some time and, I don’t know. Relax.”

I opened my mouth to respond – to try and convince them to stay. To argue, to push back, to tell them I was coming too.

But Win’s words were still buried in me. I felt so full – of dread, of confusion. Of a vague and helpless anger. It was all enough to make me burst…and yet I felt paralyzed, that I myself was just another fixture of the house – just some unwanted thing left to stand and witness another leaving love.

And what if Jess was right? What if I was the one making everything this way?

Did I want it to be this way?

The door shut behind them, the sound echoing through the house. I stayed there in the doorway, watching through the window set into the front door at Jess’s back as she went down the steps, Win’s small head resting on her shoulder, bobbing up and down – her eyes fluttering shut. The sudden warmth dissipated with the door shut, sealing out the sounds of their retreat – the engine starting, the slow backup down our driveway. I watched as our car drifted down the street without a sound. the quiet in the house shifting again – not settling this time but holding its breath.

Glutted with the words Win had whispered.

It’s not for you.

**

I don’t know how long I stood in the empty entryway. I lingered longer than I should have, hands in my pockets, staring at Win’s backpack. Jess must have left it in her rush to get out and by the time I noticed it they had been gone for too long. It was hot pink and covered with blue polka-dots. It was also zipped tight. I didn’t know what was inside, so I left it where it was. Because, for several long moments, I thought if I kept looking that maybe I’d hear the car back up again. Hear the door open. Hear her voice calling for me like nothing had happened.

The house felt airless, not empty – not exactly – but suspended. Like every room was holding its breath. But the quiet never went away. It just… waited.

I drifted from room to room, trying to shake my thoughts loose. My eyes skimmed the places no one was—the living room, the kitchen, the hallway to the stairs. The corners where shadows pooled like water.

I kept going, unable to stop, pacing the downstairs in tighter and tighter loops. Circles around Jess and Win. Circles around the toybox. Around the thing I’d seen. Around what I’d done. Each lap pulling the walls closer, each turn drawing me in.

Everywhere felt wrong without Win. Without Jess.

My mind kept replaying what I’d seen in her room, like a broken clip on a loop – the pale cuffs of her pajamas disappearing into the toybox, her little heels spinning over the edge. That lump of cold in her arms.

Except, each time I ran it back, the edges started to shift and blur.

Maybe she hadn’t fallen all the way in. Maybe she was just leaning over the edge.

Maybe the lid didn’t slam — maybe it just fell.

Maybe the lid did open easily, maybe it’d just been stuck when I tried, the wet paint sticking with humidity.

Maybe she really had found that thing in the hallway, and I’d—

I sat down hard in one of the kitchen chairs, the breath rushing out of me.

Jess’s voice came back in perfect detail. You’re scaring her. It landed heavier this time. Made my skin itch.

Was that what she saw? Not a father keeping his daughter safe, but some paranoid lunatic grabbing his kid and shouting at her about nothing?

I pressed my hands to my face and stayed there. The dark behind my eyelids was safer. But when I opened them, all I could see was Win.

I took out my phone, unlocking it and composed a quick text to Jess:

“Hey. Sorry for earlier. I know I can be a lot sometimes. Hope you and Win are having a good time with your parents.”

And then:

“Love you both.”

The air in the kitchen felt thick, like I couldn’t get enough of it down my throat. My fingers itched for something to do, anything that would stop the circling.

The toys.

I went upstairs and gathered both Milkshake and the new lump doll. I didn’t look at them too closely. I didn’t want to know if they were warm or cold. I just put them all in an old laundry basket, carried it through the back door, and locked them in the garage.

It helped a little. But not enough.

I came back inside, opened my laptop at the kitchen table. The screen lit my face in the stillness, and I tried not to stare at my dim reflection in the monitor. I signed in, minimizing all my work tabs, and opened a new tab. I stared at the empty search bar, not sure what to type.

Then it came to me. I typed: “60 Adams house history.”

It was our house address. Nothing came up at first — just realtor blurbs, aerial maps, a few grainy shots of the property from when the last owners had it listed. But there were no photos listed anywhere taken inside the house. None of them showed the nook. None of them showed the toybox.

I tried other searches: 60 Adams accidents. 60 Adams deaths. 60 Adams children.

A few old news clippings turned up, scanned crooked into the county archive. I expanded my search, replacing our address with the name of the town and county. Still, there was mostly nothing. Fundraisers, lost pets, a fire at a gas station that’s been a vape shop for as long as we'd lived here.

I leaned back in my chair, staring at the screen. My reflection met my stare, my eyes tired and too wide. I blinked, looking around the kitchen for the first time. Already it was dusk. I checked my phone, but I didn’t have a single message.

I almost closed the laptop. I almost let myself believe there was nothing to find. That the absence of proof meant I could shut this down and go sit in the living room until Jess came back. Maybe if I couldn’t forgive myself I could at least distract myself enough to forget. Bury myself on the couch in a blanket, order a pizza and maybe pick up some beer from the liquor store down the road – or maybe something stronger. Jess would be back that night, she had to be. At the very latest she would on Sunday. I wouldn’t have long to myself and maybe if I numbed the time I wouldn’t keep feeling this way all night – or all day tomorrow.

God I hoped it wouldn’t be that long.

I looked down at the laptop again, one more time before I shut it off. And that’s when I saw it.

A thumbnail on a page for the Sevrin Hill Historical Society, some buried section of their website that hadn’t been updated in years – white background with blue bulleted hyperlinks. I clicked on one of them: “Community Picnic — August 8th, 1987.”

The photo loaded slow, the pixels knitting themselves into shapes. Rows of folding chairs on the lawn in front of an old town hall. People holding paper plates and sweating in the August sun. People that looked like they could be anyone and be anywhere.

And near the bottom edge of the frame, apart from the others – a girl, maybe six years old. Standing alone in the grass. Her expression was unreadable, almost blurred by the sun.

But in her arms, hanging loose against her side, was something long and striped.

I leaned closer to the screen. My hand went to the trackpad, zooming until the image broke into little squares. But it didn’t matter how close I got. I knew the shape.

Milkshake. Or…something that looked exactly like it.

I leaned in closer, squinting, trying to let my mind run over the pixels. Trying to synthesize what I couldn’t define make sense in my mind. It was like I was looking at an old Magic Eye poster – the truth was in there, I just had to relax my focus, let my mind fill in the details.

The more I looked at the thing in the girl’s arms, the more sense it made to me. The thing in the girl’s arms was Milkshake. But the more I looked at the girl…

She was plump, and her face had the grim acceptance of the relentlessly bullied. She was short, the Girl Scout uniform she wore ill-fitted and looked even in the low quality of the image like it needed to be washed. And there was something over her eye. It could have been a trick of the lens or a mote of dust but…the closer I looked, the more I was sure. It was an eyepatch. Medical, white and wide, covering her left eye.

The same eye missing from the doll upstairs. Win’s newest plaything.

I scrolled down to the caption. The words were simple, nothing strange:
Sevrin Hill residents celebrate at the farmer’s market.

That was all. No note about the snake. No explanation for why she was standing alone, away from the other kids. Not that I really expected there to be one. Still, I felt like I was on to something. The coincidence, the eerie resemblance, was too great.

I sat there a long time, staring at that girl’s pale, unreadable face.

Then it came to me, clicking back to the previous page. I typed the year from the original link on the historical site in my search bar and followed it with “Sevrin Hill girl scouts”.

A few pages popped up, but most of it was irrelevant. Some of the results directed me back to the county’s public records, and so I filtered my search to only show results from there. I clicked on a few dead ends and found more than a few dead links. I was almost out of search results when I got lucky.

Another photo – this one a faded black and white. A line of young girls sat under a mural – the same one I’d seen with Win and Jess downtown while we’d walked over for dinner a little while ago: fields of sunflowers of varying sizes and skill in composition. The girls were all wearing smocks, and some of them had paint smudged around their noses and eyes. And there, at the very end and almost shoved out of frame, was the girl from the farmer’s market photo.

A slinking, ringed serpent wound around her shoulder.

Below, the caption read “Troop 217. From left to right: Lenore Adams, Cary Ann Clark, Stephanie Cole, Marissa Trailor, and June Howard.”

June Howard. That was the girl’s name.

I copied and pasted it into the search bar, my heart beating fast. I made my search “June Howard Sevrin Hill”. I hesitated for a moment and then added “disappeared” before jamming the enter key.

I clicked the top result.
It was a scan of the Sevrin Hill Gazette from 1992, the grain ghosted into the page like it was printed on ancient skin. I leaned closer to the screen, squinting at the headline:

LOCAL GIRL STILL MISSING

The article was barely three paragraphs. An afterthought between a notice about a pancake breakfast and an ad for lawnmower repair. I skimmed it, breathing faster and faster with each line.

Authorities continue to search for 11-year-old June Howard, missing since the evening of September 2…last seen walking home from a friend’s house in the Adams Street area, near Hollow Hill Road…quiet and shy…missing her left eye, often wears a white medical patch…no new leads.

It was the photo that stopped me.

She stood alone, framed from the knees up, her expression flat in a way only a kid who’s been through too much can manage. The white eyepatch was there, stark against her skin. In one hand was a thick hardcover book, the other a plastic terrarium. Curled up inside was a small, ringed snake. But I wasn’t looking at her face or the snake.

Behind her was a white house with a sharply pitched roof and a narrow front porch. One corner sagged, the same way ours did. The windows were set too close together. The siding was split under the eaves in a way I knew by touch.

I didn’t have to check the caption. I didn’t have to count the shingles or match the railings.

It was this house.

Our house.

I sat there staring at the screen, my hands resting uselessly on either side of the keyboard. The girl’s face filled my mind — the blunt, guarded expression, the white medical patch swallowing one eye. The same side missing from the doll upstairs.

June Howard.

The name kept spiraling in my mind, an undercurrent to every thought.

I looked again at the old photographs – the farmer’s market, the troop mural. Both times, the snake was there, draped around her like a stuffed animal for any other kind of child. Milkshake, or something so close it didn’t matter.

Maybe there was a practical explanation. Some eccentric neighbor or overzealous parent with a sewing kit and too much time on their hands, making toys to match a pet snake for the lonely girl down the street. A gift that, by some coincidence, had outlived her and ended up in our house years later. That could happen, I told myself. Small towns hold on to things. People die, boxes get donated, junk ends up in attics and thrift stores and – sometimes – in the hands of children who don’t know the history behind them.

But the more I tried to settle into that version, the less it fit. It was too neat. Too bloodless. I could feel it in the pit of me, in that place Jess would call paranoia but which I knew was something else entirely. A sharper kind of knowing. There was a ring to it – the resonance of truth vibrating inside my skull – that this wasn’t coincidence, and it wasn’t harmless. I needed to trust that, even if she wouldn’t. Especially if she wouldn’t.

My eyes drifted up, toward the ceiling. The attic was the one part of this house we hadn’t seen when we toured it. After Jess and I had torn down the boards during our first week here, we’d swept out the splinters and insulation and then started sliding things up there we didn’t need right away. Winter coats. Boxes of old books. A few sealed cartons left in the coat closet from the previous owners that I’d never gotten around to opening. The sealed boxes…

Now, the thought of those forgotten remnants made my skin prickle. Maybe there was something left behind. Something of the one-eyed girl, something of June’s. And if there was, I wanted to see it for myself.

**

I climbed slowly, my palms sticking to the rails. The attic pressed in around me as soon as my head cleared the opening. It was the same as I remembered: the pitched roof – a tent of dark beams, the scattered floorboards over insulation puffing out from between joists, and the slow, oppressive heat curling around me. My breath felt heavy in it.

A few of our own boxes sat stacked near the attic stairs, labeled in Jess’s neat handwriting. Beyond them, the cartons from the previous owners slouched against one wall, the tape yellow and curling at the edges. For a second, I just crouched there, staring, the hair on my forearms rising for no reason I could name.

I started toward them, stepping lightly along the narrow plywood path laid to keep from crushing the insulation. The floor flexed under my weight. I knelt at the first box, traced the faded writing scrawled across the cardboard – indecipherable – and popped the top.

Inside was a mess of paperbacks, most of them damp-soft at the edges, and a few ceramic figurines packed in yellowed newspaper. I shifted them aside, looking for something… more. Something that would connect.

Beneath the books and brittle newsprint was a layer of toys – cheap plastic farm animals, a jumble of hair clips, and a pair of jelly sandals gone cloudy with age. I dug deeper, my fingers catching on the cracked edge of a photo frame. Inside, faded almost to nothing, was a picture I recognized instantly—two little girls in early-90’s puffers, cheeks red from the cold, their parents standing behind them. Candace and Marie. The worn twin of the photo Jess and I had found in the downstairs coat closet. We’d found other traces of them when we first moved in – marker scribbles on the upstairs baseboards, a pair of children’s spades behind the shed, a few other photographs tucked in odd places. Little artifacts of a family’s life left behind and outgrown like discarded cicada shells.

I felt the familiar sag of disappointment as I set the frame aside. No snake. No eyepatch. No June. Just more pieces of someone else’s history.

But as my hand left the frame, something made me pause. I picked it back up, this time looking harder at the girls’ faces. One of them – Marie, I thought – had the same pale hair and glass-bright eyes I remembered from the doll Win had in her hands the night I’d carried her down from her room. Not just blue eyes, but those blue eyes, the same clear, almost unnatural shade, crystalline frost. I stared at her smile, wide and fixed, and felt my skin prickle.

The connection was loose, frayed—but it was there. The doll Win had been holding the night I’d taken her from her room. It was someone. One of these girls.

I lowered the frame into my lap, holding it there longer than I meant to, the attic’s still heat settling heavy over me. Enveloping me. Licking at me.

And then I heard it.

Not a creak, not the dry flex of wood, but a low groan from below. It wasn’t the water softener, the boards shifting in the house. It wasn’t any appliance or outer wind.

It was squelching. Luridly alive, an unmuffled groan that I felt in my bones. Deeper than a creak, wetter than wood should sound. A long, deliberate sound – something working its jaw after a slow meal.

It came again – shorter this time, clipped, a swallowed chuckle. The sound reminded me of something I’d heard before, and it only took a moment for me to put it together. I felt sick, unbalanced, even as it came to me.

It sounded like the toybox. The opening of its jaws. The exaggerated sibling to its taunting creaking moan.

I knew I should go downstairs, get my hammer, smash the fucking thing apart and take the splintered remains outside to burn them. But instead, I found myself turning toward the far side of the attic, toward the sound’s echo in my head. Hesitating only for a moment, I started toward the back end of the attic, the section we hadn’t used, running my hand along the bare wood of the slanted attic walls for support as the floorboarded path narrowed.

That’s when my hand brushed a section of wall that felt…off. Too smooth.

I turned my head, swaying slightly on my feet—the boards here were thinner, narrower, uneven in their fit. Their grain didn’t match the rest of the attic—darker, almost bruised. I thumbed on my phone’s flashlight, already bracing for something I didn’t want to see.

The beam caught on a stretch of boards slick with a black, oily residue, as if something deep in the wall had burst and seeped slow for years. The stain seemed to breathe faintly under the light, as if there were pressure behind it. When I pulled my hand away, there was a faint film webbing between my fingers, sticky and metallic in the air and on my tongue when I reflexively swallowed.

I pushed the first board. It flexed, giving before tearing away with a damp snap. I tossed it down into the insulation and reached for another. Each one peeled off softer, wetter, colder. The dampness seemed to cling, not just to my hands but under my nails, sinking in. By the time I’d cleared the last of them, I was shivering.

Beneath the boards was not more wood, but stone. Black stone – slick and glistening, reflecting the light in the same way the toybox lid did, a shifting sheen that made me think of the way an eye moves under a lid. At the center of this surface was an opening – low, jagged, puckered at the edges. A split seam in the wall, raw and uneven, as if it had grown out of the house.

I crouched low, the rafters pressing down on me, and angled the light inside. The corridor beyond was paved with uneven stones mortared with something pale and fibrous. The walls pressed in tight at odd angles – as if they had shifted and locked into place centuries apart. The cold that rolled out was a deep cold, bloodless and still.

It wasn’t just darkness in there. It had weight. It had depth that didn’t belong in the shape of this house –  the way a body can feel its wounds deeper than the shallow scar tissue.

I dropped to my hands and knees, breath loud in my ears. I stuck my head inside, the stone damp and cold against my arms, angling the light forward. The beam bled into the dark and disappeared.

Somewhere ahead, in that thin black channel, something shifted. Soft. Deliberate.

My throat tightened. I jerked back, scraping my shoulder against the frame.

For a moment I stayed there, crouched, my breath ragged, phone still aimed at the hole. Waiting for the sound again. Waiting for…something.

But the corridor was still.

I stood, my knees popping, and backed away until my spine pressed against the far wall, nearly falling into a pocket of insulation as I did. The hole waited in the beam of my light—patient. Expectant.

I killed the flashlight. The dark rushed in.

Then I turned, forcing my way down the attic stairs, sliding the plywood cover back behind me.

I didn’t look up again – not once. I went downstairs, flung open the front door, and walked to the end of the driveway. I sat on the curb, cross‑legged.

I looked down at my hands and watched them shake. Black filth under my fingernails. I breathed, hard and fast, trying to calm myself down.

“Headlights, baby, c’mon headlights please,” I repeated, I prayed, aloud to the quiet of the evening, “c’mon, c’mon, come home baby pleaaase…”

I sobbed, finally letting my head drop into my hands. I wanted my girls, I wanted home the way it was even just a day ago. That I’d take, I’d take anything over what I had seen. What I’d felt.

But cutting under even that? I had a different kind of dread. A dread that resounded in me and, even now, grew louder and louder. Echoing, repeating, demanding I feel it.

It was this – Jess wouldn’t believe me. Even after everything, even after dragging her up there to show her, I had a sinking knowing at the very center of me that all of this would be another example of breaking from them. From their reality.

No, Jess may not believe me. And I would spare myself the trial of getting her to, that I knew now. Because whatever the fuck was going on in this house – with the toys, the toybox, the horrible, lonely way in the attic – I would have to deal with it and spare them of the grief. Even if Jess never believes me, I know what I heard.

I would fix this. I would fix this for our family, for my girls.",1,1757420705.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

I have a malfunctioning Breville BES870XL that was damaged due to a voltage spike. When I opened it up, the PCB looked like this (before cleaning). After an online search, I ended up here.  
I am aware of [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/s4do2t/help_with_bes870xl_pcb/) However, I wanted to open a new one since my issue is related to voltage spike damage.

https://preview.redd.it/x3g4ygvct4of1.png?width=1641&format=png&auto=webp&s=979fc2239363dc44c218a137dffb7f3cbfa52d08

I cleaned the PCB, and from what I can tell, these appear to be the only damaged components, as everything else looks okay (image below).

**Damaged components that I believe need replacing:** ZNR1, R39, R37, R103, R19, R30, R104? (not sure about this one)

I’m also not sure about the part in the red circle — it looks like it may have melted. What do you guys think?

Before jumping into the adventure of soldering (something I have very minimal experience with), I thought it would be a good idea to share my case here and ask:  
Do you think this repair is feasible, or is the damage to the PCB too severe, making replacement the better option?

For context:  
As soon as I plug the BES870XL machine in:  
\- It seems that the standby mode is failing.  
\- All buttons in the front panel are on, and no matter what I press, nothing happens.  
\- It starts pouring coffee (hot water makes it to the portafilter).  
\- If the hopper bean is in place, it starts grinding instead of pouring coffee.

Thank you in advance for your comments and help!
