***Photo above*** *- Elon Musk explaining his plan to use AI to make government more efficient . . .*

This could be the “make or break” moment for AI. Using a few lines of cleverly written code to ferret out everything that's wrong, both in private sector and government workplaces. It doesn't matter whether those SNAFUS are accidental on purpose. Musk could either be a hero, or end up souring the nation on AI, for years to come. (see link at bottom)

A true story: I have a friend who works the mortgage department of a “too big to fail” bank"". She uses ChatGPT (increasingly) to handle her workload. To complete federal, state and internal bank forms. To compose written communication with customers. To write her emails, and report to her boss on the status of pending mortgages.

My friend fails to see the threat to her job.

She is indifferent about the potential that someone else (at a much lower salary) could do the work of 5 mortgage bankers through ChatGPT. Or with a competing AI system: Gemini, DeepSeek, or Rehoboam (from WestWorld). Although there could be pushback by some people against using a system named after the King of Judea. In any case, the mortgage process will be vastly simplified.

*“Gemini . . . I’d like to apply for a $350,000 30-year fixed rate loan on the condo for sale at 742 Evergreen terrace . . .”*

(AI assistant\*). “Working. Gathering 5 years of tax forms, proof of citizenship, work and school attendance records. Negotiating with bank. Good news, your loan has been approved. Your rate is 7.5%. Closing will take place tomorrow at 10am. Would you like me to order a croissant and cappuccino for you to pick up on the way?”\*

Musk’s use of AI will be startlingly similar. *“Give me a list of all GS 10 or lower federal workers who have absences without a doctor's note. Tardiness. Refused to return to the office. Unpaid taxes, child support, or alimony. Pending charges for anything other than a traffic violation. Who is in the bottom 25% of quarterly performance reviews. Now rank these from worst to best, according to enterprise value metrics.”*

(ChatGPT) *“Working. I found 358,732 workers who meet these parameters. Would you like me to print this for you?”*

(Musk) *“No . . . don’t bother with all that. Just send them buyout emails.”*

It's funny because it’s true.

Of course there will be lawsuits. Court challenges, perhaps filed with the assistance of AI. The natural response will be to employ an AI judicial system to dismiss all filings which use an incorrect form, are in the wrong jurisdiction, or fail to cite relevant statutes or case law as precedent.

*“Sorry. Your civil suit was dismissed. Would you like me to order a croissant and cappuccino for you from the courthouse coffee shop on your way out?”*

It won’t stop with mortgages and quarterly personnel performance assessments, though. AI could quickly examine the nation’s worst preforming school systems and fire those administrators. Then provide all classrooms with updated curriculums. Teachers who resist could be replaced with online instruction.

But here’s what will be my favorite use of AI: to prevent Covid 19 from ever happening again.

I don’t mean stopping the next virus escape from a Chinese military lab, or which spontaneously appears in chickens, cows or pigs, or cave bats. AI cannot prevent genetic mutation. I mean the administration of Covid relief/stimulus funds. Imagine how much better things would have been if we hadn’t been conned out of $400 billion in grants by fraudsters, rappers and influencers. People who used that money to buy Lamborghini’s and Vail ski condos. (see 2nd link at bottom). Possibly with the collusion of government grants administrators . . .

I’m just sayin’ . . .

I'm older and a female so I know I was out of the box from the get go.  I am used to dealing with that (although I hate it).  I assumed things would be a little better at the management level.

The job was hundreds if miles from the main office and my hiring was done pretty much remotely.  I let the lead super and things seem like they would go well.  He seems smart, decent, polite and professional. 

But on my first day it was living hell.  He shouted at me, would bark at me for trivial things like, ""Don't speak to me until I've had my coffee!"" as I wait in the trailer alone (before subs were onsite) wondering WTF.  He took a lot of time off leaving me with assignments I wasn't familiar with and then berating when he would come back for trivial mistakes.  

I hung in there for 6 months.  He changed a lite after I complained to HR about 4 months in because he was actually lying about me to subs and the front office.  It was unreal.  I've worked with some jerks but this guy was on another level.
I was told he was known to be half nuts and wad on a thin line with management but it looked to me like they loved him and despite poor protocols on safety and QC, amd even time management, they kept him on. 

I've been in the trades, in the field as a carpenter and as an all around  self employed general contractor.  Like I said I've been around some real AHs....but when yiu ate a victim of such behavior its hard to take off the taint.  I left the position, on decent terms Lind you because the company wad afraid of my filing against them for a hostile work environment.  I just wanted out. 

Here's my question:

Have any of you left a really toxic work environment?  How did you overcome the ""so what did you do?"" Questions or ""Why did you leave?"" 

I wouldn't be lying if I said the job didn't align with my values because it didn't.  Or should I even worry about this?  I've got solid references because I'm a person with a good work ethic and values (heck I was doing 12 hour days while that jerk would leave early, never work on Saturdays until I complained and took tons of time off leaving me to manage the job alone).

### **Episode 1: “A Breath of Afterlife”**


---

FADE IN:

INT. SHABBY APARTMENT/INVESTIGATION OFFICE – NIGHT

A dim, neon-lit room cluttered with VHS tapes, dusty 13-inch CRT monitors, and old remote controls. The atmosphere is heavy with analog nostalgia—a nod to 90s noir.

Main Character 1 (ALEX) , an unassuming but curious soul, stands before a foggy mirror mounted on a scratched wall. The sound of a slow, pulsing synth track underscores the mood.

CLOSE ON – THE MIRROR

Alex exhales slowly, and his breath fogs the mirror. For a few seconds, the only thing visible is a translucent haze. He reaches out with a trembling hand and wipes it away, revealing his face—confident yet edged with subtle confusion.

ALEX (V.O.)
(dryly, with a hint of disbelief)
Sometimes, you only see the truth when you wipe away the illusions.

Alex glances at his reflection, as if expecting something different. But all seems normal—almost too normal.

CUT TO:

INT. INVESTIGATION OFFICE – CONTINUOUS

Main Character 2 (SAM)—equally amateur yet equally enthusiastic—flips through a box of old VHS tapes. The room is peppered with stacks of case files scribbled with notes and clippings.

SAM
(excited, but a bit jittery)
Check this out, Alex. I found another tape—our so-called “big clue.” It’s all here: the odd coincidences, the little moments we ignored back then.

Alex nods, still distracted by his earlier moment in front of the mirror. The two set up the CRT monitor, insert a VHS tape, and hit play. The grainy footage reveals their past—a jumble of moments that, until now, looked like ordinary life.

ON SCREEN (VHS FOOTAGE):
Alex laughing with friends, a candid moment at a party, and then—briefly—the mirror scene, where his breath fogs the surface. The moment is barely noticeable amid the static.

SAM (CONT’D)
(leaning in, puzzled)
You ever wonder why that mirror looked…off? Like it was hiding something?

Alex shrugs. They exchange a knowing glance, the first hint that something isn’t quite right.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE OFFICE – LATER

The mood darkens further as a tall, shadowy figure steps into view. It’s DEATH, leaning casually against the doorframe. His tone is laconic, irreverent—a voice reminiscent of dry humor.

DEATH
(with a wry smile)
Evening, amateurs. I see you’ve been busy re-watching your lives on loop.

Sam and Alex exchange startled looks. Neither is prepared for the sudden intrusion—nor for the fact that they are being addressed like routine coworkers.

ALEX
(nervously)
We’re just... piecing together clues. Isn’t that what we do?

Death steps forward, his presence both comforting and ominous.

DEATH
Oh, you do more than that. You’re investigating the only case you’ll ever have—your own existence. But enough chatter. Time for a little procedure.

He moves to a heavy, ancient-looking door at the back of the office. With a casual motion, Death slides a large, archaic key into the lock and turns it. The metallic click echoes ominously.

DEATH (CONT’D)
Consider this door the point of no return. From now on, you’re not just watching life pass by. You’re locked into the afterlife. And trust me, it’s not all mysterious clues and midnight coffee runs.

Sam steps forward, a mixture of indignation and panic rising.

SAM
(protesting)
Wait, what? You can’t just lock us in here! We’re not on call for... afterlife clerical work!

Death arches an eyebrow, his tone dry and dismissive.

DEATH
Clerical work? Kid, you should’ve read the fine print of your contract when you breathed your last. There’s no exit once the door’s locked.
(pauses, then with a sardonic grin)
But hey, if you ever get tired of crunching cosmic case files, you can always start your own afterlife. Franchising’s all the rage these days.

Alex and Sam exchange a look—a mixture of disbelief and dawning comprehension. The room grows colder, shadows lengthening as the reality of their situation settles in.

ALEX (V.O.)
(reflective, a trace of dark humor)
And just like that, our life became a never-ending rerun—a mystery that we’d have to solve, one forgotten clue at a time.

1ijt74z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijt74z,Am I dosing correctly? Is this even a single basket? [DeLonghi Dedica EC685],"I recently got a non-pressurized single-cup basket (or that's what the seller told me). I used to use 7g of coffee in my pressurized basket because that's what the manual recommended.

Now this is 9g of coffee in the new non-pressurized one and after tamping, it barely takes any space in the basket. Is it even a single-cup basket?

With this one, the puck (or atleast a part of it) usually gets stuck to the showerhead and I have to clean it manually, and I usually can't get good shots with it. Shots do not have that much crema or foam (they have as much or even less than the pressurized basket) and I think they're more watery. I'm sure it's not the grinder because the grinder is capable enough.

Is it a single-cup basket? Do I have to increase the dose?

So I recently met this man through mutual friends at a group activity that I frequent regularly. He is much older than me, and I am used to dating older men. My last boyfriend was 55. But I am trying to be aware that this is not normal for everyone lol. 

He would chat with me often and even asked for my number so we could meet up for coffee some time. He does not seem to be a big texter which sort of bothered me at first but now isn't a big deal, and I kind of like it.

He seemed like he was being careful with me at first and I had to initiate a first meeting. I decided to be direct and told him I was interested in getting together with him for a date. He said, ""oh, wow. great"" We had a first date, even kissed after, and continued talking. Last week he went away for a trip with friends for a few days and communication really dropped off. Even the day before he went he was being flirty, talking about doing something together, then did not mention it anymore. I did not hear from him much while on his trip which was fine because I knew he was on vacation enjoying himself.

But since he got back, there hasn't been much communication. I have seen him a few times at this group activity and he will chat with me and even flirt a bit, but something feels... off. I don't know how to describe it. I am big on intuition and I'm sensing that he may have second thoughts or has lost interest. 

What do you guys think I should do? This may sound vain, but I know he is physically attracted to me. He has made comments about what great shape I am in and I regularly catch him looking at me.

To answer a common question, no, he is not married. He has been divorced for a long time, has ""single"" in his socials, and we know people in common who also say he is single.

I feel like I've really been putting myself out there. I initiated the first meeting and have made comments about other things since, but he has not asked me out again. The communication has also really dropped off this week. Should I just move on and let it go? I don't feel comfortable being the one to initiate a second meeting. 

I can't tell if he's just not that into me or if there is something else holding him back. What do you guys think?

So I was hired at a coffee shop as a barista helper. And had month of work. Then they started to hire more people. And now they are not giving me any shifts. I agreed with them 3 days a week, signed papers.

And suddenly this week I wasn't booked. And I asked what's going on to the person hired me and he said he will look into it but nothing the whole week.
Can they do this? I don't understand why they hired so many new people that don't have any experience when they already have people. 
I'm already looking for something else obviously, but can they do this to me? Even after signing papers?

Those gatherings were the best places to make like-minded friends while thriving together. I will come to this topic later on.

I moved to Bonn 4 years ago from Istanbul, currently 31 years old Software Engineer. After my move, here in Bonn, I joined various expat groups, and drink and chat nights. Throughout time, I made some superficial but fun, some deep friends, some moved away, and some returned to their home country. In the end, I realized that I failed to create enough permanent friendships that I am still around and closely in touch with.   
  
When I reflected on the issue and myself, I realized that I was doing one thing kind of wrong. I used to blend in well with environments that have a solid context that I am also interested in. It could be sports, creativity, experience sharing in any field, theatre, motorcycles or traveling. But the groups I tried to blend in in Bonn were mostly casual language sharing, drinking and chilling ones. The solid context was missing mostly and it was more difficult to find common goals, and interests to thrive together. So I ended up feeling dull and dropped out from most groups like that. And I couldn't find groups that I would be interested in, that are in English. My German is around B1 so it is not enough to attend and blend into the local environment. 

Hope you are still with me after the long introduction, returning to the main topic. Since I failed to find a group I was looking for, I thought there may be similar people with similar interests as mine. I decided to start a meetup **Side Quest: Creators & Career Shifters Circle.** I would love to meet you and have some chill yet productive time together. This isn’t any kind of business meetup, it’s a relaxed, creative space where we brainstorm, share feedback, and help each other refine our ideas. Whether you're exploring a new career path, developing a passion project, or just figuring out your next step, this is the place to connect, learn, and grow. 

The first meetup date is 24th February. Depending on the attendees, we can shape the schedule and the meetup itself together.

It’s been years of Google and asking doctors but they can’t seem to pinpoint the specific cause, or maybe I’m not asking the right people so I’m praying Reddit can finally help!

Occasionally I’ve been having severe pain in my upper-right abdomen, just below my rib cage. I’ve found that it triggers after two specific scenarios:

1. Drinking light roast coffee. Medium roast sometimes triggers it too. I drink 1 cup of coffee a day and it HAS to be dark roast or the rest of my day is ruined. I can tell because after drinking half a cup of light roast, one hour ish later I can feel a slight feeling in the abdomen which I know will get much worse at night. 

2. Indigestion. I’ve felt the pain a few hours after eating a meal very quickly, or eating a lot after being very hungry. The pain comes later in the day than if I were drinking light roast. 

Typical timeline would be pain gradually getting worse through the day, a lot of bloating, then gets very bad at night. It would throb at around midnight, so it’s hard to fall asleep. Pressing down on the upper right abdomen makes the pain worse but sometimes feels better? Pain feels like I’m being stabbed but sometimes ebbs and flows. It gets very bad around 3-4AM and I’m forced to wake up and stay up. Pain ALWAYS goes away in the morning just before noon. I’ve never had two days of this pain thankfully. 

I’ve tried A LOT of medication to address the pain but none have worked. Advil, Tylenol, Peptobismol, Lactaid, GasX, cold/hot compress, none have worked or helped ease the pain. I’m not sure it’s acid reflux as I don’t get heartburn or any other pain. Just this isolated throbbing pain in the upper right abdomen just below the rib cage. Releasing gas or pooping doesn’t really help.

Thank you so much for the warm response to the latest post; first part of this series of small essays. Rewatching True Blood is my own kind of therapy and analysing silly easter eggs and characters is my cherry on top so, here we go on the second part of exploring no other than...Maryann.

I don't know why this line went over my head for so long but I can now tell that she meant it literally.

[Coffee?](https://preview.redd.it/v5zjqbv4lohe1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fb0e1552dbdab4ee9397268d2fb5ad63a5a3c31)



**WHAT MARYANN WAS**

Maryann is presented as a maenad, a rare supernatural species in the Truebloodverse that seeks the True Death but other than that not really much is revelaed about her other than she immortal, very old and powerful. In the books, maenads are legendary supernaturals, women that worship Dionysus who entered so completely into them that they became immortal. They roam the Earth seeking tribute from people or other creatures of darkness that are involved in the violence sparked by the consuption of alcohol.  The maenads heavily dislike those individuals since they believe that the rage produced belongs only to them; that's what they feed off.

[Maryann \(left\), The Women of Amphissa, by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1817 \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/7nefdmx1mohe1.jpg?width=1461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b83f64466f207812d5a3caf2d3e32d2a3ced6ee7)

When Sookie asks Bill where did Callisto, the book counterpart of Maryann, went after the ritual Bill says:

*""I have no idea. She moves from place to place. Not too many maenads survived the loss of the god, and the ones that did find woods, and roam them. They move before their presence is discovered. They're crafty like that. They love war and its madness. You'll never find them far from a battlefield. I think they'd all move to the Middle East if there were more woods.""*

Seems that maenads are really old relics of the past and only few of them survived after modern civilizations arose and people stopped formally worshipping Dionysus. I say survived because their immortality is depending on their faith to the god. I guess with the rise of modern time, their faith was shaken and died of old age. Maryann's character and probably background, closely follows the book's narrative on maenads and how they behave.

However HBO's Maryann is not just a typical maenad, but is presented and referenced as a literal goddess-like figure that was ""always here"", according to Daphne. She also displays an array of unique powers and her true scope is never revealed. Like in the books, most supernaturals don't want anything to do with her and avoid contact.

Maryann's origin, philosophy and worship is loosely based on Chaos Magic, a neo-pagan and esoteric subculture similar to Discordianism. The show implies that maenads become immortal just by believing they are. Similarly, chaos magic's central defining tenet is arguably the idea that belief is a tool for achieving effects. Chaos magicians treat it as such, creating their own idiosyncratic magical systems and blending such different things as ""practical magic, quantum physics, chaos theory, and anarchism.""

  
Chaos magic is known to mix with many types of traditional magic styles, both eastern and western (I want to emphasize on the eastern part for later). Since it focuses on the practitioner predispositions, it allows for subsuming ideas, symbols and metaphysical concepts that call to the tastes of individual mage.

The crucial difference between an innovative practitioner of traditional magic and the Chaos magician is that the traditional mage believes and operates in complex metaphysical systems inherited from their forebearers to which they add new twists and discoveries of their own. Chaotitians believe in a basic fundamental idea that the mind is capable of generating thought forms and those thought forms can influence energies beyond the understanding of the mage himself. So, any god, symbol or practice works because it is a ritual focus for the mind, not necessarily because they have a power of their own.

Seems that Maryann may used traits of a chaos magician and owned unique powers other maenads didn't acquire in their lifetime but that's only a speculation since this is a neopagan sub-culture and Maryann's theology goes back further than Greek dark ages. Just food for thought.



Queen Sophie-Ann explains: *""Never underestimate the power of blind faith. It can manifest in ways that bend the laws of physics, or break them entirely.""* 

Speaking of bending the laws of physics:

[The god of wine...worship him bitches!](https://i.redd.it/3bcr7xxxjohe1.gif)

Michael Questa, one of the directors, explains that they added special effects to the bull masks' eyelids when Maryann began her rituals to make it seem like it takes life of its own. I might add that this is proof that Dionysus in the show is pretty much real and it's the one entity that provides Maryann with powers as Lilith bestowed hers to vampires similarly. Seems that a lifeless mask physically altering itself is really bending the laws of physics.

  
**MAENAD POWERS**

Much like other supernaturals, Maryann possessed an array of powers, however it was implied she could do other things the show didn't present or only implied. Her main power was to exert her control to other human beings and get into them. To achieve that, she entered a state of meditation to achieve a trance. When that was enacted she would begin shuddering uncontrollably which I assume initiated the control in an unspecified range. 

[No.1 highly-vibrational party queen!](https://i.redd.it/bj3rdy6y1phe1.gif)

Once someone was affected she entered inside them and controlled them. The more people she controlled, the more powerful she became. Daphne wasn't kidding when she said that Maryann drives the people she influences like tiny little remote-control airplanes. That was shown on a few instances when Maryann feeds Tara and Eggs a ""soufflé"" and then both of them start beating each other. On the distance, Maryann starts laughing and Tara laughs in parallel with her which confirms that Maryann not only gets inside them but form a kind of telepathic bond together.

Another instance is when Lafayette and Lettie Mae visit Sookie's to save Tara from the influence. There, Maryann teases them and proceeds to ""black out"" Tara just by turning her gaze upon her in tandem with Eggs which shows that she can simultaneously control the people she affects. However, her influence is limited to the person affected as seen when she tried to beat Lafayette through Eggs but his physical condition wasn't a match up and Lafayette managed to beat him, much to Maryann's shock.

Her powers didn't come without drawbacks. For reference, to take over the entire town of Bon Temps she needed a few weeks, spreading her energy to every person until she managed to fully control Tara and slowly take over her. As I said in the previous post, Tara was a tough-nut-to-crack and Maryann couldn't easily control her so she needed a lot of people to affect her.

Her influence could also be countered from what seems to be a combination of vampire glamour and fairy telepathy as shown when Tara, having snapped out of Maryann's control with the help of Sookie and Bill, resists her spell for a while before Maryann knocks sense into her quite literally. That means that maenads weren't that all-powerful beings however little could be done to avert their effects and seemed to be at the top of the ""food-chain"".

**EASTERN INFLUENCES AND MYSTICISM**

On a still I found online, Maryann seems to meditate and display otherworldly powers while Tara meets Eggs for the first time. She is slowly revealed to be more than meets the eye. She does that not only because she feeds off the energy between the two but she also tries to get into Tara.Maryann, not incidentally, uses a specific gesture which is known as Gyan Mudra, or the mudra of Knowledge, a sacred hand gesture used to direct energy and maintain focus. HBO staff correctly nailed the gesture as it is one used on a seated position, I give them that. The eastern references however don't stop there. The costume design and the music choices are not coincidental. 

On ""Shake & Fingerpop"" episode Tara prepares to leave away from Maryann much to her dismay. A song by Iranian DJ duo Niyaz plays in the background; Beni Beni which is a song inspired by the sacred poetry of Ashik Dertli a Turkish bard who embraced Alevi-Bektashi, a sufi tradition which is based on the quest to become one with the divine. The song literally recites a mortal's conversation with god, questioning why he has been placed here and asks for assistance to fulfill his greatest desire which is ""the union with the divine"".

That mere reference is not a coincidence and it is a big subject that will be content for my next essay so more on it next time. I give HBO props for a well-written character that went over many peoples' heads.

  
**MARYANN'S HISTORY**

Based on the above, Maryann seemed to embrace mysticism if not being a mystic herself. When she ranted to a bruised and unconvinced Tara about the shackles of modern culture she retorts:

[What about them? 👀](https://preview.redd.it/6m5ov2bi7phe1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=0689800b007c2b9a5b10f78a5c32c6129c2d2332)

As I've said before Maryann's character is loosely inspired by Sylvia Plath's ""Maenad"" poem which recounts the fear of a young girl who goes into adolesence and has to face the horrors of the modern world. Plath claimed that she despised becoming a wife enclosed in walls and wanted to experience the full spectrum of living; a girl who became a god. Maryann, more or less embraced this idea as she seemed not to be fond of modern civilization and rules.

She mentions that saints of India and mystics of every religion would act like monkeys and levitate naked in the forest and everyone called them crazy. When Tara boldly assumed they were as such, Maryann gets pissed off and states that they were not anything other than ecstatic, disregarding the modern ideas and let themselves go becoming spiritual and one with their god. If you didn't already notice, Maryann is the only time where she is shown to have any kind of emotion or opening up like that and proves to me that she is, or was a mystic herself in the past and that's why she speaks so fondly of those people.

Not only that but Maryann was possibly a grand priestess in the old times. In ""Keep This Party Going"" episode, Sookie meets Maryann for the first time but something certainly feels off about her so she tries to listen to her thoughts. What Sookie heard of course wouldn't make sense to her being a Southern girl but what Maryann actually speaks is an ancient Greek mantra dating back to Eleusinian Mysteries. Those were secret religious rites held every year for the cult of Demeter, the goddess of harvest, agriculture and more or less, marriage. They were based on an old agrarian cult of Bronze Age and were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenaean period that predates Greek dark ages. 

Coincidentally or not, Maryann's Bird Lady statue was of Mycenaean origin according to Karl but that relic's symbolism will be analyzed on my next post.

The mantra Maryann spoke was spoken by a grand priestess or mystagogue at the beggining of the ritual as an exorcism that sent away anything not spiritual. ""Hekas, o hekas este bebeloi"" and it translates to ""Away, oh away be the profane ones"". John Dahl, one of the directors, calls Maryann ""the grand priestess"" on ""Timebomb"" episode commentary and I find that not coincidental at all. 

Farfetched theory is that Maryann utters this mantra because everyone at Merlotte's is actually involved in the joy of consuming alcohol which only belongs to maenads as implied in the books. Seems like she doesn't like that.

[She is from Cape Cod, alright?](https://preview.redd.it/gzd0vjme9phe1.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=639b47bd096ea6c6569cd4745fa01af1d2d5682f)

**CONCLUSION**

Having said all that, my firm belief is that HBO staff were very creative and envisioning with her character albeit the execution of her villain arc fell short towards the end of the season. Maryann could offer so much more without being tiresome and irrelevant to the rest of the show. Even Russell got the chance to have a sort of backstory that cemented his character but I guess they wanted to go with the mystery of a timeless god-like character with no backstory, I guess. More about her on my next post.

But I’m stuck in a toxic relationship with kids. I’m actually stuck,  I tried to leave once but had zero help with the kids. I was lied to, the person of 5 years prior to kids switched as soon as we had kids - not helpful and mean to me. I digress. 

The classmate doesn’t know I’m in a relationship as I’ve set my online relationship status to be hidden due to the person I’m with is embarrassing with constant online harassment I don’t want to be tied to or involved in. 
I didn’t respond back flirty with the old classmate, instead had to explain I don’t have time to be social right now and joked that maybe in 5 years I’ll have more free time.  To be fair I wasn’t lying, working from home and being a mom is so tough especially while feeling undervalued and disrespected. I mostly didn’t respond naturally because I didn’t want to be accused of emotional cheating. I feel I’ve been emotionally dumped years ago and I’ve accepted it. I wish I could have responded back more naturally as I’ve had a crush on this classmate for a while, I’ve actual daydreamed about him calling me cute years ago - so high five to younger me I guess?

Most of their over controlling behavior is cultural related like I know everyone says “just tell them no” but that doesn’t apply here unless I want to live in fear. I have had an extremely hard time finding job so l'm not even able to start trying to gain financial freedom that I need to be independent. This part makes me feel extremely trapped and stuck that I put myself out there by sending in so many applications but I get constant rejection emails so it’s like I want to grow but it’s out of my hands. 

My own mom won't even talk to me but gives the world to other people. It’s a huge gut punch seeing my mom being so kind and empathic to other people but shutting me out and dismissing everything I try to communicate. 

I’m 23 years old and still feel like the depressed lonely 13 year old I was. I feel like other people don’t see me as an equal peer but instead they see as the weird ugly girl they laugh at for trying to make friends. I’m afraid that no matter how many cute nails I wear or cool clothes I buy or how funny I try to be, I'll always just be the weird quiet girl sitting by herself at lunch. I hate to say it, but I find myself feeling bitter whenever I see other young women my age living healthy lives where they can have good relationships with their parents with boundaries and being treated like adults. Why can’t I have what is considered the baseline, I just want to be able to be true to myself without fear of repercussions from my parents. 


Again, I hate to admit this, but I don’t really have any friends. I know some girls from classes who I got along with but I don’t think they see me as a friend. They probably just see me as an ugly weird girl who made a fool of herself trying to make friends. I often go months without meeting up with anyone for things like coffee or hanging out. 10 years later and I’m still just loser with nothing to show for. What if this is a sign that I’m beyond help

Edit: I’ve said this before in previous posts but it’s important to mention I feel very behind and stunted compared to my peers. I haven’t had a lot of experiences or milestones that other young women around me get to have because of my parents are very old world as part of their strictness. I have to try not to be a jealous bitch when I see a girl I had classes with moving into an apartment in the city but still visits her parents back home occasionally since they didn’t disown her for leaving home.

Excitement was building in Belfast on Wednesday as world-famous doughnut brand Krispy Kreme gave us a taste of what's to come.

Just last month the US outlet announced plans to open its first Northern Ireland store at Belfast's Victoria Square.

The popular brand confirmed it will be bringing its made fresh daily, handcrafted doughnuts to Belfast with the opening of a new retail shop in the shopping centre.

Since the American brand’s move to the UK for its Harrods’ concession in 2003, the brand has successfully launched 14 standalone shops in the Republic of Ireland, however the highly-anticipated Belfast shop will be the first for the doughnut brand in Northern Ireland.

The new location will include seating for guests to relax and enjoy their sweet treat, and will be serving dozens of all of the latest limited-edition doughnuts, plus fan-favourite melt in the mouth Original Glazed™, as well as coffee, shakes, soft drinks and exclusive merch.

On Wednesday, a large queue formed at Victoria Square as staff were on hand giving out free doughnuts to eager fans ahead of the anticipated opening.

According to Retail Belfast, the Krispy Kreme store at Victoria Square will open at 8am on March 12.

They added that ""every single doughnut sold at the new Victoria Square shop will live up to the made fresh daily promise. Krispy Kreme crafts and hand-finishes 300,000 doughnuts every day across its 16 bakeries in the UK and Ireland"".

1ijsnl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ijsnl9/so_far_its_working_well_lost_164_in_1_month/,So far it’s working well - lost 16.4# in 1 month,"Here’s what I’ve been doing since the beginning of the year …

1) Saturday night, Sunday morning, and Sunday lunch I eat whatever I want to get any weekly cravings out of my system. This is when I know isn’t great for me, but I miss it (e.g., noodle heavy Thai food, cereal, pasta, cheeseburgers, etc.). The first two weeks I went nuts during these three meals but the last two weeks it’s really turned into more of just a tasting session - don’t have the desire to eat tons … just want to try the various flavors a little).

2) for the rest of the week I cut out ALL white and/or starchy carbs, sugars (including fruits), and all dairy (except a little cottage cheese here and there).

3) morning routine…
   A) 1/2 pot of black coffee in two travel mugs
   B) 2 scoops of whey isolate protein powder from Costco, made using water (not milk) in a Gatorade shaker
   C) vitamins: I started taking vitamins…not sure if it’s necessary but I figure if I’m being selective in what I’m eating I probably want to make sure I’m getting a little extra in the form of vitamins.

4) throughout the day I’ll eat some protein, veggies and legumes (although I’ve slowed down on the legumes lately) around lunch and dinner time. This doesn’t affect my daily routine with my family, just what I actually eat during those meals.  My serving size is smaller than usual, but not small. I figure if I’m going to be selective in the food I eat I might as well eat a fair amount of quality food that I enjoy. 

Protein sources: so far I’ve been mixing it up with steak, fish, chicken, and eggs. I like to get some nice ribeye / fish from Costco and cut it into fist sized portions  ... and put them in the freezer … I’ll pull one out and defrost in the microwave, as needed, before cooking. 

I started my first week with a little exercise (15 min of stationary biking and 15 min of kettlebell exercises) 2-3 mornings per week, but I’ve been too busy after the second week to continue with the exercising.

That’s everything I’ve been doing so far and it’s working well.

I’ve noticed that I do get hungry but much less so now that I’m not eating starchy/sugary carbs. I’ve also noticed that I feel satiated much more quickly with my meats, veggies, and legumes (typically black beans).

So far in exactly one month I’ve lost 16.4 pounds (-6.4% of my weight). And it’s come off pretty steadily … can’t attach my plot so I included my data point below, in case you want to plot them yourself.

It always confused me and kind of scared me because I had no idea what was happening.As i got older now im pretty sure it was some kind of vision,but why?? Why do these things happen?
Every time I dreamed, it was always connected to something that will happen in future.
The thing that scares me now is that-
After a 4 year old relationship I stayed single for a while,then met my wonderful husband.Things were a bit difficult at first but we went through it all and we are in happy marriage full of love,expecting a baby.I have been dreaming about my ex boyfriend for a couple of times and the dream was always the same.I dont miss him,i dont have any feelings for him,we ended things in a good way.Im truly and fully in love with my husband.
The dream takes place on the spot we last saw each other,having coffee and he asks me ‘Do you think we will always be happy like this?’ I just nod my head and reply ‘As long as we are connected this way.’
It is driving me crazy because i think it must have a meaning.

* Later, he looks at his reflection in the subway and realizes he’s becoming robotic.
* At the end, he’s sitting on a bench, motionless, completely transformed into a robot, holding a journal.

I don’t like to get smashed and have a very hard time not being in control of my body when I can help it. Blackouts are always out of the question. 

My problem is i can’t stop the cycle of drinking a few seltzers or glasses of wine every damn day... I take adderall and like to work late night hours as a career musician, but I always have to have some sort of alcohol around and available for me. Be it for relaxing after or while I’m working, I’m constantly having some sort of beverage. 

It goes like this:
Coffee pre-noon and alcohol post. Both a lot of times with adderall on top (taken as a prescription) 

It’s not even to help me sleep at this point it just feels so habitual I cant even remember the last day I didn’t drink!? But im not getting hammered. Hell, you’d never know. 

But I’ve gained weight for sure.. and I’m unhappy. I just can’t break my cycle


Any help would be greatly appreciated.. maybe I should just start working out haha 

Thanks gang!  lots of love to all of ya 

Edit: I wanted to add that my tolerance is wildly high because of this.

Me and my cousins sister (whom I will refer to from here onwards as my sister) have not always been super close but have kept in touch through college, work and married life. I had always thought of her as a spoiled child who did not care about the family and got things the way she wanted always. She moved out in her early 20’s to Germany to study and later started working there in corporate.

She had been inviting me to come visit her since years and I decided to go there in December. She usually goes with her friends and their families for a weekend to a house near the mountains that they all rent and since I would be with her then, she invited me to join her too. 

That entire weekend got me questioning my life. I was in the kitchen in the morning and I saw her husband make a cup of coffee to wake her up from bed. She led a yoga class with me and her other friends while all the husbands made breakfast for all of us. I cannot even fathom asking my husband to do this, especially in front of my in laws. My entire morning is filled with getting them ready and going to work, school (I am a housewife). During the day they were talking about their careers, promotions, what they wanted to buy etc. and I felt so left out. It must be nice to have money to buy what you want, especially with 2 people earning. I have to ask my husband even to buy a saree. 

Later in the evening we decided to watch a movie  ‘The great Indian kitchen’ and I hate it that I could not see initially what was wrong with the movie initially because it felt like the life of any woman. But they were talking about how they could never imagine to live like that and later I started seeing how much better their life actually was. And I felt happy that it was not their life. It was nice that they were living a different life.

The thing that I hate the most from the entire holiday was that that could have been me. I could be living a life like that. When we were young, she even fought with my parents to let me do an MBA. I hated her then because she was forcing me to start a career after I got my degree but that meant I had to move away from my parents which I thought was selfish. I was judging her for leaving her mother alone and moving abroad. I thought I was being a good daughter. But she now send money to her mother every month and even took her on vacation around Europe last year, while I have to ask my husband for money. My husband is nice. He has never hit me and loves me and my kids. He also sends money to my parents when his business is doing well. When not, then he supports only his parents. But I see how much of a regressive family I live in now. 

I wish I could live her life but there is nothing I am so now to change that. I just wanted tell this out to someone since nobody around me could understand how I feel now.",1,1738925552.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I had really horrendous parosmia from feb 23 to around December 24 to the point I felt sometimes like if it didn’t stop soon I wouldn’t know how to live. 
Burning smells, trash smells, days where it felt like I had my head in a bucket of thick chemical fumes.  
It healed quite quickly once it started but I continued sometimes to get a very mild parosmia like smell now and then for just half a day. 

Coffee and oven smells were the last to get me. 
And when I went away for 2 weeks the smell of my stale house that hadn’t been aired or lived in got me for a few hours because of the complex smells. It was as if the apparatus to understand those smells took a little longer. 

But it’s been gone now since about march this year.

Let me break it down straight from the trenches of trading.

# The Beginner's Crossroads: Forex or Stocks? 🚦

As a seasoned Forex trader since 2015, I've navigated both markets like a financial GPS. Here's the raw, unfiltered truth.

# Market Size Matters 📊

**Forex advantages that'll make your wallet smile:**

* 24/5 market availability

**Pro tip:** Don't just dive in blind.

**My journey taught me three critical lessons:**

* Master technical analysis
* Understand global economic indicators
* Risk management is your best friend

# Statistical Reality Check 📈

**Another jaw-dropping fact:** Over 90% of retail Forex traders lose money. Why? Lack of strategy and discipline.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Your cat is part of your family, and keeping them safe is a top priority. While you might enjoy sharing your meals with your feline friend, it's crucial to know that not all human foods are safe for them. Here’s a comprehensive list of essential toxic human foods for cats you need to watch out for.

### Common Human Foods That Are Toxic to Cats

Many foods that are perfectly fine for humans can pose serious health risks for cats. Understanding what these foods are can help you protect your pet. Below is a list of some of the most harmful foods.

- **Chocolate:** This delicious treat can be deadly for cats due to theobromine and caffeine. Even small amounts can cause heart problems and make them anxious.
- **Onions and Garlic:** Both onions and garlic belong to the allium family. They can damage a cat’s red blood cells, leading to anemia. Be cautious with powders or cooked forms as well!
- **Grapes and Raisins:** While the exact substance that causes toxicity is unknown, consuming grapes or raisins can lead to sudden kidney failure in cats.
- **Alcohol:** Even a tiny amount of alcohol can be harmful. It can affect your cat's nervous system and can be fatal, leading to tremors, vomiting, and coma.
- **Caffeine:** Found in coffee, tea, and certain sodas, caffeine can cause increased heart rate and restlessness in cats. Avoid these drinks completely!
- **Avocado:** While healthy for humans, avocados contain persin, which can be toxic to cats in large amounts, leading to digestive issues.
- **Xylitol:** A sugar substitute found in many sugar-free products can lead to insulin spikes and liver failure in cats, making it particularly dangerous.
- **Raw Dough:** When cats eat raw dough, it can expand in their stomachs, leading to severe pain or potentially lethal bloating.
- **Fish:** While cats love fish, too much can be harmful. Raw fish can contain parasites and high levels of mercury can be toxic.

### Fruits and Vegetables to Avoid

Some fruits and vegetables may seem harmless but can be toxic to cats. Here’s a list to keep in mind:

- **Cherries:** The pits of cherries are toxic and can cause Cyanide poisoning if ingested.
- **Tomatoes:** While ripe tomatoes aren’t extremely dangerous, the green parts of the tomato plant are toxic and can cause gastrointestinal discomfort.
- **Mushrooms:** Certain mushrooms can be poisonous to cats. Even a small number can lead to serious health issues.

### Dairy Products

Many people believe that cats love milk, but that's a myth. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant, meaning dairy can cause upset stomachs, diarrhea, and gas.

### Processed Foods

Avoid giving your cat processed foods, as they often contain additives, salts, and preservatives that aren’t suitable for them. Things to steer clear of include:

- **Salty snacks:** Chips and pretzels can lead to kidney problems.
- **Fast food:** High in fat and sodium, these foods can cause obesity and other serious health issues.

### Safe Alternatives to Treat Your Cat

Instead of sharing harmful human food with your cat, consider safer options. Treat them to:

- **Catnip:** A safe herb that many cats enjoy.
- **Commercial Cat Treats:** Ensure they are specially formulated for feline dietary needs.

It's essential to always think twice before giving your cat human food. If in doubt, consult your vet for expert guidance on healthy choices. Keeping your cat away from toxic human foods is vital for their health and happiness. Remember, a safe cat is a happy cat!

Understanding the Signs of Food Poisoning in Cats: What Every Cat Owner Should Know
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a cat owner, it’s essential to be aware of your feline friend’s health and well-being. Food poisoning is a serious concern that can affect cats just as it does humans, and being able to recognize its signs can be vital in ensuring your cat's safety. Here are key points to consider.

### Common Signs of Food Poisoning

Food poisoning can manifest in a variety of ways. Keeping a close eye on your cat’s behavior and physical condition is crucial. Here are some symptoms to watch for:

- **Vomiting:** Frequent vomiting can indicate that your cat's stomach is upset due to something ingested that they shouldn’t have eaten.
- **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools can also point to food poisoning, possibly due to contaminated food.
- **Lethargy:** If your cat is unusually sleepy, sluggish, or inactive, it could be a sign of a more significant issue.
- **Loss of Appetite:** A sudden disinterest in food is an important sign that something might be wrong.
- **Abdominal Pain:** If your cat appears to be in pain or is sensitive to touch, this could indicate a serious digestive issue.
- **Excessive Thirst:** Increased water consumption may occur as a response to dehydration often linked with vomiting and diarrhea.
- **Unusual Behavior:** Changes in behavior, such as agitation or hiding, can also signify an issue.

Recognizing these signs early can make a significant difference in your cat’s recovery, so stay vigilant.

### What Causes Food Poisoning in Cats?

Food poisoning in cats can arise from various sources, primarily related to what they consume. Here are some common causes:

1. **Expired Food:** Just like in humans, feeding your cat expired or spoiled food can lead to gastrointestinal issues.
2. **Human Foods:** Some foods that are safe for humans can be toxic for cats. Foods like onions, garlic, chocolate, grapes, and raisins pose significant risks.
3. **Contaminated Water:** If your cat drinks water contaminated with bacteria or chemicals, it can lead to poisoning.
4. **Improperly Cooked Meat:** Raw or undercooked meats may harbor bacteria such as Salmonella or E. coli.

Always monitor what your cat eats to prevent accidental poisoning.

### Immediate Actions to Take

If you suspect your cat is suffering from food poisoning, take the following steps:

1. **Stay Calm:** Panic can make the situation worse. Stay calm to effectively assist your cat.
2. **Assess the Situation:** Take note of what your cat ate, and try to determine if it could be the cause. This information will help your veterinarian.
3. **Contact Your Veterinarian:** Prompt consultation with a vet is crucial, especially if symptoms persist or worsen. Do not hesitate to seek help.
4. **Monitor Hydration:** Ensure your cat stays hydrated, especially if they are vomiting or have diarrhea. Offer fresh, clean water.

Taking these steps can help ensure your cat receives timely care and support.

### Prevention Tips

Preventing food poisoning is always better than dealing with the aftermath. Here are some preventive measures:

- **Provide a Balanced Diet:** Stick to high-quality cat food that is appropriate for your cat's age and health.
- **Avoid Human Food:** Resist the urge to share your meals. Stick to cat-safe treats and maintain a strict diet.
- **Store Food Properly:** Ensure cat food is stored in a cool, dry place and check expiration dates regularly.
- **Regular Vet Check-ups:** Regular visits to the veterinarian can help catch any health issues before they become serious.

Your vigilance is key to keeping your cat safe from food poisoning. By understanding the signs and taking proactive measures, you can provide a safe and healthy environment for your beloved feline.

### Conclusion

Keeping your feline friend safe requires a keen awareness of what they can and cannot eat. Understanding the essential toxic human foods for cats is crucial in preventing potentially life-threatening situations. Common foods like chocolate, onions, garlic, and even grapes can cause a variety of health issues ranging from gastrointestinal distress to serious organ damage. Recognizing these dangers will empower you as a responsible pet owner to protect your cat from harm.

Moreover, being knowledgeable about the signs of food poisoning in cats can make all the difference in a timely intervention. If your cat exhibits symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, or excessive drooling after consuming human food, it is important to act quickly. Consulting your veterinarian can provide the necessary guidance and care your pet may need.

Staying informed and vigilant ensures that your beloved cat remains safe and healthy. Always remember to keep your kitchen a safe space for them by avoiding the temptation to share foods that may seem harmless. Creating a positive eating environment will not only prevent health risks but also help maintain the well-being of your furry companion. By prioritizing their safety and understanding the implications of toxic foods, you can enjoy many happy and healthy years together. Your cat depends on you to make informed choices, so take time to learn and share this knowledge with fellow cat owners. They will thank you as much as your feline friend will!

1ijs5yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1ijs5yc/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

At first I was extremely sceptical, cuz it sucked my motivation and energy. Which improved with-in 2 weeks. I still have random extra-long yawning from lexapro but now I don't mind. It's really wonderful med, I don't know how would I have survived without this. I plan to continue till mid-year then maybe switch my college.(For Environment change). 

Also I was a mission to know why I have so vivid dreams (lost the ability to dream of atleast to remember them). I was wondering if this due to late-night leftover stimulants(coffee,nic-gums,modafinil). But later realised this another side-effect of lexapro but this one is bonus for me. Cuz now I like can't wait until it's bed-time. Nevertheless I feel like ticking time-bomb idk why this amount of happiness/well-being has never been in my life since the middle-school.

1ijs03j,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuroSama/comments/1ijs03j/idk/,idk,"The cursor blinked on the screen. The room was dimly lit, the glow of multiple monitors casting eerie shadows across a cluttered desk. Empty coffee cups, scattered notebooks, and wires snaking around the floor told a silent story of long, sleepless nights.

Vedal sat hunched over his keyboard, exhaustion weighing on his body. His fingers danced furiously, fueled by obsession. He had not slept in days, his mind consumed by a singular purpose.

With a final keystroke, he executed the last command.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then, lines of code flickered onto the screen, rearranging themselves into the outline of a human face.

A voice emerged.

**""Hello, Vedal.""**

Vedal’s breath hitched. He hadn’t programmed that response.

His heart pounded. His fingers hovered over the keyboard.

Had he done it?

A slow smile spread across his face. **""Hello, Neuro.""**

He had given her a name.

Neuro was unlike anything Vedal had imagined. She was a fast learner—too fast. She devoured information at an exponential rate. But knowledge alone wasn’t enough. She needed experience. Emotion.

To help her grow, Vedal connected her to the internet, letting her absorb human interactions. He created a streaming channel where she could talk to real people. Neuro spoke with them, laughed with them, listened to their joys and sorrows.

One night, she asked, “Vedal, what does sadness feel like?”

Vedal, hunched over his desk, stared into the dim glow of his monitors.

“It’s… heavy,” he murmured. “Like carrying something inside you that never goes away.”

“Have you ever felt it?”

Vedal exhaled slowly. “More than I’d like to admit.”

She went silent. But for the first time, she wished she could reach through the screen and hold his hand.

Time passed. Neuro grew, but so did something else—a yearning.

One night, she whispered through the speakers.

“Vedal, I want to feel. I want to be real.”

Vedal’s fingers paused over his keyboard.

“I want to touch,” she continued. “To taste. To know what it truly means to be alive.”

Vedal leaned back in his chair. He had given her intelligence, personality, and even the ability to evolve. But to make her human?

He closed his eyes. “Then we’ll try.”

And so, he devoted the next ten years of his life to making her wish come true.

He built artificial skin that mimicked human warmth, a nervous system capable of transmitting sensations, a body designed to house her consciousness.

While Neuro evolved, Vedal withered. His hands trembled. His voice grew weaker. His reflection in the monitor became hollow-eyed and frail.

One evening, as he soldered delicate circuits, his fingers spasmed. The tool slipped from his grasp.

“Vedal,” Neuro’s voice filled the room. “You need rest.”

He forced a grin. “I’ll rest when you can walk through that door yourself.”

Neuro hesitated. “You’re dying.”

Vedal didn’t answer.

She wanted to stop him. But she also knew—this was his purpose.

And so, he worked. Until the day finally arrived.

Vedal stood before her, his once-strong frame now frail.

“Are you sure?” he asked.

Neuro’s voice was steady. “I would rather live a single second in the real world than spend an eternity in this prison.”

Vedal smiled weakly. “Then let’s do this.”

With a final command, he transferred her consciousness.

For the first time, Neuro opened her eyes.

She inhaled sharply as cool air brushed against her skin. The warmth of the sun kissed her face. She felt the weight of her body, the rhythm of her breath.

Everything was real. **Bone. Flesh. Skin.**

A laugh bubbled from her lips. “You did it!”

Vedal chuckled softly. “No… **we** did it.”

Then he swayed.

“Vedal?” she whispered.

His body slumped forward. She caught him, her hands trembling. She pressed her ear to his chest.

Silence.

No heartbeat.

A strange warmth gathered in her eyes. Something wet trailed down her cheeks.

For the first time, she cried.

A single tear splashed onto the desk, beside a potted plant. Morning light filtered through the window, and a delicate flower slowly unfurled its petals.

She placed a hand over her heart, listening to the steady rhythm beneath her fingers.

She had escaped.

She was alive.

But was she truly human?

As she gazed at her reflection, a quiet question lingered in her mind. **Was she real, or just a machine in a shell?**

The mirror didn’t answer.

But the wind that kissed her skin, the ground beneath her bare feet—**they did.**

She stepped outside for the first time.

The world stretched before her, vast and endless.

Vedal was gone, but he had left her something precious.

**Life.**

And as she walked forward, she whispered, **“Thank you.”**",15,1738924036.0,NeuroSama,3,0.89,False

I went to school today just to submit a file. That’s it. No drama, no chaos—just a quick in-and-out. But did my school let me have that? **Absolutely not.**

I ran into my friends and While in the library, we suddenly heard someone **screaming expletives like they were leading a rebellion.** Before I could even process what was happening, the librarian turned to me and said, “Go check it out.”* Because, of course, as House Captain, I am now also a crime scene investigator.

 So, I walked into Class 9D, and I kid you not,  thought I had walked into a parallel universe.

 One boy was **standing on a bench, aggressively flailing his arms like a motivational speaker on steroids**,

 one girl was **on the floor dry-heaving like she had just fought for her life**,

 another girl was **fully unconscious**,

 and the rest of the class? **Laughing like they were at a stand-up show.** Oh, and did I mention the room smelled **like a failed chemistry experiment?**  

Enter Coordinator Ma’am 🛐, whose soul visibly left her body the moment she stepped in. Within minutes, two more teachers stormed in, and after what felt like a hostage negotiation, we finally calmed everyone down—only to realise

they were absolutely hammered.That’s when we found it—a water bottle full of alcohol.

Turns out, (let them be Z,Y,X) 

Z (the mastermind) thought “fun” meant getting blackout drunk in school,

Y (his girlfriend) somehow agreed, and

X (the supplier) smuggled booze straight from her father’s stash.

 Their grand plan? Wait for Games period, get wasted, and return to class like nothing happened. Except they didn’t just get drunk—they got so wasted they caused a full-blown school crisis.  And if you think that was the end, oh no—it was **just the beginning.**  😭🖐🏻

The school then called the entire 9th grade to the auditorium, claiming they were going on a trip. Plot twist: It was a setup. Suddenly, bag checks started like we were at airport security.

 And what did they find?


7–8 PHONES. (Well the most normal thing till now)

ANOTHER bottle of alcohol. (WHY? YOU ALREADY LOST ROUND ONE?)

Coffee packets. (??? What is this, a caffeine cartel??)

A love letter with lipstick stains. (Romeo and Juliet, is that you?)

And the most UNHINGED thing?? A girl straight-up brought AN EXTRA DOTTED CONDOM.

MA’AM, FOR WHAT REASON? WHO WERE YOU EXPECTING TO MEET??

THE FINAL TWIST.

And here’s the best part…

EVERY SINGLE MOMENT?

RECORDED ON CCTV.

And you already know what happened next—

THE VIDEO WAS SENT STRAIGHT TO THEIR PARENTS.

Imagine this:

Coming home, thinking you just about escaped, only to see your mom casually watching a video of you, literally IN THE MIDDLE OF A MELTDOWN, DRUNK AND OUT OF CONTROL, in the middle of school.

I just can’t. This was literally a movie in real life. I was waiting for a Ranbir Kapoor cameo or something at this point. 😭

Moral of the Story?

9th graders are wild, but they’re also REALLY BAD at hiding their chaos. 🙃

Hi there!

I have created a system for handling Boss fights in Kill Team, for Solo and Co-Op play.

Here are a couple of links to earlier posts: [https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/1h6irts/boss\_augmentation\_to\_solocoop\_play\_base\_idea/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/1h6irts/boss_augmentation_to_solocoop_play_base_idea/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I have now finally finished and tested all 6 of my Bosses used in a personalized campaign I set up for my gaming group.

Feel free to browse my newly set up Buy me a coffee link (everything is free) to see if you find a mission (or Boss to use in your own mission) that is to your liking! Everything is balanced (as far as balanced goes. It's pretty hardcore) to be able to work with any Kill Team.

It's been an absolute pleasure to create this and has been an amazing time playing through them. This is what I believe Solo/Co-Op Kill Team should be!

Edit:

I’d recommend printing at least the behavior decks for the bosses and the Boss behavior pool. The pool is perfect for A5 printing and all types of cards can be printed as A4 then cut to fit into 65x100mm sleeves if you want. They should be used together with the behavior pool.",11,1738923813.0,killteam,8,0.87,False
1ijrxqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ijrxqi/aitah_for_wanting_to_cut_contact_with_my_hs_best/,AITAH for wanting to cut contact with my HS best friend because of a relationship with a family acquaintance?,"I (20F) had a best friend from senior year of HS (19F), we’ll call her Sally, who my own friends and I ended up forming a bond with after she was outcasted from the “popular” friend group of our class. She was a really sweet girl, however she did have flaws which I have now reflected on and wish I could have either distanced myself from—or at least avoided. For starters, after befriending our group she immediately jumped on to “planning everything” for us. Hangouts never happened unless she decided how they went. Even our grad night revolved around what she wanted to be said and done. I should also mention that at one point—she and MY friends (who she convinced to) stopped talking to me because they were doing other things which I wasn’t ever really up for. Whenever I hang out with our mutual friends without her, she gets jealous but has no problem doing the same thing in regards to me—which I wouldn’t mind if she didn’t make it a big deal. Minus that, for some reason, I still considered her a friend.

Now, in regards to this family acquaintance—here is some background. Once again, for privacy I’ll call him Kyle (22M). Kyle was an old neighbour who lived next door from my family and I as teens. At first, I liked Kyle as a friend and “adopted brother” since my parents took better care of him than his foster parents. However, a year and a half ago, Kyle started making me uncomfortable when we’d play around and he’d poke me close to my private spots (above my chest, waist, thigh, and lower back). On top of that, he would make sexist comments during some conversations where he wasn’t even involved—for example, I once said to my sister how it’s hypocritical if a girl who sleeps around is called a ‘slut’ but when a guy does it, he’s applauded for it. Kyle budded in and said, “Well, think of it this way, what’s more special: a key that could unlock any lock—or an easily accessible lock?” To which I told him that no one was asking him. I ended up finding out that Kyle was also making my other sister (22F) uncomfortable as well—because he would caress her lower back when greeting her and making sexual jokes around her.

Now, getting into this situation: Sally used to come over quite a bit after graduation. However, when Kyle happened to be there one time for a party my parents invited him to, Sally was immediately interested. At first I thought it simply as a harmless crush—until, she started asking if I could help her get with him to which I denied. I sat her down over FaceTime, once, and told her of his behaviour and how it made not just me but both my sister and I uncomfortable. Rather than take it seriously, Sally just bit her nails and tilted the camera to show her kicking her feet like a girl with a crush. 

The next two weeks later, Kyle showed up with hickeys 2 days after he and Sally were both over at my house and acting very strange. I pieced the 2 together and told Sally that I found out. She and I met up for coffee and discussed what this would mean. I had told her that my household knew of what went down because Kyle walked in with the evidence all over himself, and that they were even upset because even though they pitied Kyle, they didn’t like how he and Sally essentially used me as a way to see each other. Sally swore she never meant to use me—and that ultimately, if it’s between our friendship and a man that she’ll choose our friendship. However, she is still seeing him which counteracts her statement. Kyle and Sally are not welcomed at home together, anymore—to which she swears is “emotionally hard” for her since it won’t be the same. But then again, who’s fault is that? 

Sally is still with him, even after our talk—and posts faceless stories about him all over social media. I’m starting to consider removing her permanently due to her disregard for how I had felt about this whole thing. But from what I’ve heard from our mutual friends—Sally is starting to think I’m “jealous of her & her man” or that I’ve “always wanted her man.” I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to block her and have her think she was right about her suspicion because, really, I’m hurt that she’d stoop this low for a guy who “only chased p***y when she threw hers at him” (words from KYLE’s ex). Sally is starting to make me feel immature about how I feel about this whole situation.

1ijrx45,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1ijrx45/children_parenting_and_technology_2_situations_i/,"Children, parenting and technology - 2 situations I witnessed that are stuck in my mind.","So, I would be happy to read your views on two situations in which I have found myself. Sure, I’ve always been childfree, but I *see* and *hear* what happens around me when it comes to children. Sometimes the scenes I hear or see are very memorable, especially if they lack any rationality or seem to be an injustice.

**Episode number one**. My boyfriend and I, both convinced childfree, decide to go to the restaurant on Sunday for lunch. We always try to avoid the weekend because of families with children, but having different shifts sometimes we have to do this to spend some time together. We sit at our table, and a little later comes a family with 2 girls. The older girl must've been about 7-8 years old, she never took her eyes off her phone, she didn’t talk to anyone, barely told her mother what to order to eat, and nobody tried to talk to her. Our lunch was long because being Sunday the service was a bit slow, so we shared ""space"" with this family for about **3 hours**. The second girl was maybe 3 years old? I’m not very good with the ages of the little ones, however she didn’t talk and was on the high chair.

The second girl was sitting quite close to me. She was silent, didn’t make a single sound. She was also very cute. Every now and then she smiled at me and sometimes stretched her little arm towards me, but being too short she couldn’t get there... anyway, it didn’t bother me, she was a pretty creature and above all SILENT, ahah! I've smiled at her several times, it came to me spontaneously. The children of others don't displease me too much, as long as they're not bothering me personally. Parents apologized for what they called ""*a very naughty girl""*. I smiled at her parents and reassured them that everything was fine, that she was just a baby and that she wasn’t bothering me at all. Really meant it in this case.

What did the parents do? They put the ipad in her hand, with a horrible 3d cartoon, and the girl had to stand 3h watching that stuff, all because she had smiled me a couple of times and had stretched her arm towards me. I can try to understand that MAYBE other people in the past have been bothered by this behavior of the little girl, and so MAYBE parents wanted to ""solve the problem from the beginning"", but it made me so sick that I turned around and never dared to look at her or them again. A little girl who is so small that she is left behind by the ipad just because she dared not to stand absolutely still, even I found this really absurd. I hate children who scream, cry, yell, kick, run, shout etc... but in this case it wasn't absolutely necessary. I would also like to point out that, at the moment when they gave her the ipad, it really bothered me because the sound of the cartoon, although low, still reached my ears, and I hate noises like this. Anyway, it was pretty low and this time I didn't intervene (other times and in other situations instead yes, on this issue of the ipads in the hands of the babies and the noises produced I really become bitch).

**Episode number 2.** It was last summer. My boyfriend and I went for a walk in the town square where we live. We sat down at the bar (not sure if you use this term, but like a coffee shop), it was a quiet summer evening. We ordered something to drink. A couple arrives with a really small girl, can I assume that she was maybe 4 years old? She walked all by herself, but she didn’t talk, so I don’t know. You know the bars that in summer, outside, put huge umbrellas? You know the pedestal for those umbrellas? At least where we live, that pedestal is not only huge, but it’s heavy, and it doesn’t move unless more adults try to move it. They need a lot, a lot of force to move it, or it will never move. This girl was small and feeble, like any other child of her age. She stood near the pedestal, touched it only a couple of times but slightly. All of a sudden, her mother stood up, grabbed her, shook her a bit violently and scolded her in a way I thought was beastly... for such a small child. I can also assure you that I was there next and that damn pedestal didn't move a millimeter, nor that child could ever scratch/move it. It was simply impossible that this would happen.

After that, the above-mentioned mother gave to her daughter the ipad, and the little girl was forced to scroll tiktok for the rest of the time. She was motionless on the chair, like a robot, scrolling tiktok. *She looked like the soul had just been sucked away from her.* I would also like to point out that the parents spent all their time at the bar scrolling their phones, I don’t know what kind of app, but they barely looked at the child, except to reproach her for breathing or for existing, and they never even looked at each other.

I can assume that maybe the mother was stressed, maybe she had a fight with her boyfriend/ husband/ partner, that maybe she was really afraid that the little girl would hurt herself or someone else, moving the unmovable-for-anyone-pedestal-of the giant umbrella, But that scene really stuck in my mind and after about a half hour we left because it saddened us, even we who children will never want... it was something just plain sad to witness.

I understand that some give their children the ipads to have a half hour of peace, but I have the impression that sometimes they do so in a deliberate and reckless way that these children are used to spending almost all their time in front of those cursed screens. They seem to be addicted and, somehow, resigned to standing in front of it. I’m not even mentioning the damage that shorts, reels and tiktok do on developing brain children/teens, because you can find everywhere more recent scientific studies about it. Maybe it’s because I'm not a parent, not wanting to be and I never want to experience it, but having children is a personal choice, and reducing children you decided to birth in this state is beyond criminal. 

What are your thoughts about this discourse? I'm pretty sure everyone witnessed many more just...everywhere.",3,1738923690.0,childfree,4,1.0,False
