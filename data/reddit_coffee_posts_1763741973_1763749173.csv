1p35zcf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p35zcf,"L'OSIER (Tokyo, 3*, November 2025)","L'OSIER is 3 star French restaurant founded in 1973 and one of the restaurants I was most looking forward to trying due to its reputation and my love for French or French/Japanese cuisine. Making a reservation on Tablecheck wasn't very difficult, I dined with a local friend who had been wanting to go for quite some time. I know they take solo reservations over the phone, the space is quite limited for solo diners however as they seem to only have 1 table available for solo diners per seating. 

The restaurant is located within the Ginza Shiseido building and the interior is absolutely stunning. White, gold and light elements were everywhere and I was seated in the middle section of the bottom floor so I got a good view of the various art pieces placed around. Easily the most flashy and sophisticated dining room I have been to this trip. I noticed mainly local diners and 2 pairs from overseas. The dress code is a more strict than all the places I've been to in Japan with a requirement of male guests to wear a jacket but they can provide one if you don't bring one.

The service provided was flawless, the team really delivered on providing an excellent dining experience as well as being all around easy to chat with about food and my other hobbies. Unfortunately didn't get to talk to the head chef, I think he might have been busy which was a shame.   

I went for their seasonal special lunch course which features white truffles with a starting cost of ¥55,000 but they have more affordable options. I know they have an extensive and impressive wine selection but we only ordered a couple of the non alcoholic beverages which were still great. The meal lasted about 2 hours and 20 minutes but time flew by. With all the bread options and dessert cart I felt quite full towards the end. 

1. Amuse bouche: black truffle tart, Momiji shaped red bean and custard leaf & beetroot - solid start to the meal, taste was nice with my favourite being the black truffle tart. More visually impressed though 
2. Saga Egg - Tenkeiko & Cepe mushroom with mushroom foam with white truffles and crab meat - great umami flavour from the mushroom and the white truffles were exquisite 
3. Zuwaigani Crab on toasted crab and some of the mushroom - loved the plating firstly, delicious bite wish there was more 
4. Blue Lobster with butternut squash, chestnut, root vegetables and a coral sauce - again the plating was terrific, sauce flavour was well balanced with truffles and lobster. felt the root vegetables could be stronger 
5. Bretagne Veal wrapped in green leaves, rice and vegetable balls - favourite dish flavour wise, the sauce with truffles was my favourite component with great cook on the veal. the little nest of vegetables were good complimentary to the sauce but the nest itself was extremely crispy giving extra texture to the dish. 
6. Millenaire Sorbet - very tasty first dessert, can't say no to a crumble and more truffles 
7. petit fors - raspberry, chocolate with lemon and cream, berry with caramel cracker and coffee vanilla tart - solid little bites no complaints 
8. Chestnut, hojicha ice cream and white truffle tart - love hojicha and pairs nicely with the white truffle
9. Sweets trolley: financier, canelé & caramel candy - delicious quick bites, wish I had more space to try more

L'OSIER to me feels like a restaurant which should be saved for special occasions, its the perfect space to feel pampered and experience luxury. My favourite 3 star I had this trip due to the dining space and the quality of food. An easy recommendation from me, I would definitely come again to try a different seasonal menu.",1,1763748909.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

It's the little things,"I work for a community college in the financial aid department as a part timer. Can't work more than 29 hours a week because my state considers 30 hours full time, I make ""too much"" for SNAP, and my kid is too old for us to use WIC (though it was so helpful when she was younger!) We really rely on food banks from a local church and while I'm thankful for what they can provide, the quality of food is just getting less and less. I've been job hunting for full time employment since December of last year when I realized this place isn't gonna hire me full time but I've just had no luck. No savings to fall back on so to keep a roof over mine and my daughters head, I stay here even though I'm miserable because something better will hopefully come along. I was lucky enough to survive a lay off that happened just last month where 70 employees got laid off and I was one of the very few part timers who did not get laid off... so I'm thanking my lucky stars for that. I door dash and donate plasma on the weekends when my daughter has play dates just to make ends meet until I can find something that pays more than $20 a hour lol

Today was a transfer fair where a bunch of 4 year colleges set up in our library and gallery space and they catered in chick-fil-a for the high school students to grab lunch. I've been skipping meals for months now. Usually I just eat dinner at home with my daughter and drink water and coffee throughout the day to not feel hungry. My daughter gets free breakfast and lunch at school so that's one less worry I have on my shoulders. I'm also dealing with health issues like rapidly losing weight and trying to get any doctor to take me seriously has been an uphill battle 

One of my coworkers in my office brought back the boxes with a chicken sandwich, a bag of chips and a cookie for each of us because someone in the admissions office ordered too much and let me tell you, I wanted to *cry* because that stupid overpriced chicken sandwich was *so good*. I try to avoid fast food at all costs because it just isn't worth it to me but this was the first time I got to eat lunch in months. I saved the cookie for my daughter to surprise her with when I pick her up from after school care (love that her school lets out at 2:50 pm but i have to be at work until 5:30) as a fun treat because it's so rare I'm able to treat her with fun stuff like cookies or cupcakes 

It's silly and I know in the grand scheme of things it probably doesn't matter but man, a dang chicken sandwich made my whole day",7,1763748856.0,povertyfinance,3,1.0,False
1p35yhm,https://i.redd.it/hbm06ijvin2g1.jpeg,Falling in love with schizoid- autistic person,"Hi... I'm a male in my 20s with a mild form of autism. I'm not a romantic person at all, nor someone who imagines being in a relationship.

I've never fallen in love in my life except with one schizoid girl(she has autism too). I first met her online when I was selling a graphic tablet and she was the one who bought it. She used to be a digital artist, and I always loved her art style.

One thing that stayed with me is that she once asked if wanted to hang out, but I said no. Three months after that, she disappeared. For a month or two, I thought it was because of college or just another phase (I was used to seeing her disappear for some time, and I knew she was going through difficulties). But I started to worry, because I knew she struggled with suicidal tendencies and had attempted it twice before. I tried to see if there were any hints about her online or any reports of suicide in her area, but I found nothing.

I finally made the decision to check her college the next year (her college was on the other side of the city where I study). Many embarrassing situations happened, but eventually I found her and I gave her a pin bage i made for her. After that, we chatted normally for a month or so.

Eventually, she asked me if I had a crush on someone, and I just told her the truth. She simply rejected me. But we kept talking, and I felt like there was no longer any barrier between us.

After some time, we decided to hang out. Nothing fancy- just went to a mall near her college. We sat and talked for about an hour, didn't buy anything, not even a cup of coffee. Just talking until her mom called to pick her up. During that hangout, I gave her a gift: a figure I designed and made based on her online persona. 

Before leaving the mall, she told me, ""This little hangout of ours was surprisingly nice and natural, and I didn't need to make myself appealing or mask like I used to do with my ex-friends."" She told me the same thing again later while we were chatting. But she  thanked me a lot for the gift - she really liked it but she was wondering why I did all that for her. I told her the truth-that I was obsessed with her.

She told me, ""Don't imagine a life with me at all. I'm schizoid. I've never had a crush on anybody, not even fictional characters. I don't care about romance, or even small things like friendships.But now you reached out to me after a year - I didn't want to be mean I don't want to be mean, so I accepted talking to you again, but the truth is that I don't have any friends and I don't desire any. I don't let people into my life, and I keep everyone who isn't family at arm's length. I'm going through this phase again. I want to be left alone for an indefinite amount of time, so, you won't mind?.""

We've been texting everyday since we matched two weeks ago, getting to know each other. First date was a week after matching.   
  
I was surprised on the amount she is texting, good morning texts, updates, getting to know each other with questions. Texting throughout the day. However, I feel like she's a little reserved. Short answers, but does seem interested. She has a younger kid, does 50/50 coparenting, a week at a time. I just don't want her to get bored with texting. I feel like I want to get to know her more in person but want to keep the interest there with text on the weeks she has her kid because she isn't available to do anything then. 

Any suggestions on being flirty with texts, asking questions that aren't boring, keeping her interested. I really like her, but I also know she wants to take things slow because there's a kid involved - which I 100% agree with.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

The old town is compact and calm. Medieval walls, Baroque touches, and vineyard slopes shape the scene. It works for slow travel, wine days, and easy walks.

**Why go**

* Authentic medieval hilltop with river views.
* Traminac and Graševina tastings in historic cellars.
* Principovac terrace sunsets over vines and the plain.
* Flat riverside walks and access to the Danube cycle route (EV6 spur).

**Top things to do**

* **Odescalchi Castle + Town Museum:** Archaeology, folk culture, and city history in bright galleries. Allow 60–90 minutes.
* **Medieval & Sacred Ilok Walk:** Ramparts → quiet lanes → Church and Friary of St. John of Capistrano. Gothic details and peaceful courtyards.
* **Old Wine Cellars (Stari podrumi):** Guided tastings in 15th/18th‑century cellars. Ask about Traminac and archive bottles.
* **Danube embankment:** Easy path by reeds and moorings. Best at sunrise or sunset.
* **Principovac Estate:** Hilltop terrace for lunch or a golden‑hour glass.

**Wine note** Ilok is known for Traminac (Traminer) and Graševina. Start light, then move to richer wines. Use spit cups if you drive. Book tastings early on weekends and during harvest.

**Itineraries**

* **Half day:** Castle and museum → medieval walk → cellar tasting → sunset on the embankment.
* **Full day:** Coffee at Principovac → castle + museum → long lunch → afternoon tasting → river stroll.
* **Weekend:** Sights and tastings on day one. EV6 spur ride and small producers on day two.

**Eat & drink** Restaurant Dunav serves river fish and regional dishes by the water. The Old Wine Cellars restaurant pairs classic plates with local wines. Principovac offers fine dining with vineyard views. Small family spots cluster near the ramparts and riverfront.

**Stay** Vineyard apartments at Principovac are romantic. Riverside rooms are handy for walks and parking. Medieval‑core guesthouses put you close to the castle and cellars. Book early for September harvest and summer weekends.

**Getting there & around** By car: about 330 km from Zagreb. Osijek is around an hour away. Vukovar is about 40 minutes. By bus: long‑distance lines link Zagreb and Vukovar with Ilok; check seasonal timetables. Cycling: the Croatian Danube section of EV6 passes via Vukovar and Osijek; Ilok is a worthwhile detour with mostly flat riding. The old town is walkable. Taxis are limited; arrange rides for wineries.

**When to go** Spring is mild and green. Summer is long and hot, with busy weekends. Early autumn brings harvest energy and golden vines. Winter is quiet; check opening hours.

**Events**

* **Ilok Grape Harvest:** Early September, with parades, music, and open cellars.
* **Vinkovo:** Around 22 January. Vineyard blessing and pruning mark the new wine year.

**Border note** A bridge links Ilok to Bačka Palanka across the Danube. It is an international crossing. Carry passports and allow extra time in summer.

**Final take** Choose Ilok if you want heritage, river mood, and serious white wine. Plan one guided tasting and one sunset meal. Leave space for slow walks and vineyard views.

1p35m0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/1p35m0n/update_considering_dropping_journalism_more_my/,Update: considering dropping journalism more. My motivation is gone.,"I had another stern conversation from my editor at the public media outlet where I do 100% remote volunteer work and freelance for, and she told me that I'm ""just not ready"" to be a reporter. I'm ""too disorganized, can't manage my time, slow,"" etc and it's all true. 

I've always been slower with turning in assignments. Something that takes a normal person 1 week, for instance, might take me 2-3 weeks. After I graduated J-school this got even worse. I tried freelancing, and completely lost the ability to manage my time. I couldn't stay motivated to even iniate the task of writing one email to that editor, creating that pitch, or finding sources and instead drowned in a paralysis of shame and overthinking. I haven't finished a single story, or have been able to get responses for a single pitch and it's been MONTHS. So embarassing. 

The way I process information too is almost all 100% verbal and it's a lost cause for every editor I've encountered. I don't even fit into other spaces for disabled journalists like myself. I simply don't have the executive functioning skills to start these assignments, and I don't have a way of processing information I'm given that isn't a burden to people. It's again, all through conversation. I went MIA with this remote gig several times just from a pool of my own depressive, unmotivated state. 

I want to accept I don't have the discipline to be a journalist, but I don't know where else I belong. My original dream was to be a psychologist,  involved in law, involved in any soft science, or international relations. I have no intelligence other than this verbal IQ, and despite wanting more for myself have been told ""people like me"" belong in grocery stores and retail but nowhere else. 

It's a shame because I really enjoyed belong a journalist in the right settings too. Now I spend my days working at a coffee shop and mooching off of my poor parents, hoping I can figure out a better higher education alternative for myself. I just feel like there's something fundamentally, exceptionally wrong with me for being this dysfunctional. ",1,1763748069.0,Journalism,4,1.0,False

But really, I've posted about how much my health has improved before and how I've been able to run for the first time in about 30 years.

I've now run in two 5ks and am finishing in pretty good times for someone with an old busted up knee and an AARP membership. I have another one coming up in a few weeks.

Last night I ran a little over 4 miles with pace repeats worked into the middle. Training for a 10k. So from not being able to jog three steps to that is pretty liberating. This morning I ran a couple of miles to the coffee shop did a pretty good time for me and had zero aches and pains less than 16 hours later. 7 months ago I got winded bending over to tie my f*cking shoes. I'm getting stronger and faster. I'm no longer the slow food offering you want with you during a bear attack! 

Couldn't have done this without Zepbound. This medication literally saved my life. I'm sure of that. But also changing diet and starting to excersize made all the difference. I'm in maintenance and still getting new positive change and results.

I got frustrated at times and felt like it wasn't going to work for me. If you're feeling that its ok. Feel your feels. But don't get so frustrated you give up.

1p35hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p35hoh/aitah_for_going_on_dates_after_a_break_up/,AITAH for going on dates after a break up?,"I could give a huge long story here, but it really boils down to this: I have set a standard for myself in dating based on psychology. If a man cannot imagine marrying you and having a future with you by 90 days, he likely never will. This is something I live by because in today’s dating scene talking stages are more popular than actual dating. I was very honest with my ex about this and he agreed.

Until we hit that 90 day mark and I told him I was planning for the future and looking to align certain parts of my life to better fit us in the next year.  For instance, making changes to my current home for it to be a rental property when we one day live together and applying to jobs that are more remote and don’t require as much travel. We are medium distance living about 2 1/2 hours away from each other and largely only get to see each other on the weekends. Let me clarify, I’m not saying I wanted to move in with him then, just that it’s something I wanted to be prepared for in the future so I should start working towards it now. He broke up with me because of it.

He was very upset by this, despite never mentioning it before. He now claims he broke up with me because he knew he was going to marry me one day and it terrified him…

I knew he likely did not feel he made the right decision so I offered for us to get coffee a couple weeks after the break up. During this timeframe, I texted him every few days or so, and asked if he had anything new to share with me. He always just said, ”I don’t know if I made the right decision” but nothing more and lacked any form of vulnerability. This didn’t make me feel safe going on a date where I could be met with someone still uncertain of me, who I love, so I canceled.

Anyways, I was very shocked when I went on a date a week or so later with a new guy instantly asking me to be his girlfriend. If anything, it made me realize I wasn’t going to get over my ex anytime soon, even though we had only been together for three months. 

A few days past and I decided to reach out to him. He was so excited I wanted to rekindle. Then, he found out I had been on a date and instantly berated me and ended things. 

This happened 3-4 months ago… what has happened since? Basically the same thing three times. He ends things with me often times in an hateful way, I eventually go on a new date (3 in total now), and we play tag as to who reached out first. 

Every time I speak to him, I am always prepared to start fresh, but he has a mindset where he thinks I  “choose people over him” and he can’t get over it. It’s turned extremely toxic and borderline abusive as he basically calls me a whore for trying to move on every time he leaves me. The problem is I do really love him and he does really love me.

This weekend we are going to formal event together and staying at an Airbnb a few hours away with one of his friends and their date to the event. I’m scared for what the event will bring because he is extremely possessive. He has even said if he sees me speaking to another man at the event, he’s going to fight them. I genuinely think this is crazy because I have never cheated and will never cheat. But when someone breaks up with me, yes, I’m going to try and move on!

I don’t really want to move on from him. I think this has brought out a terrible place in him, but I do think he is an amazing person. I’m just really tired of asking for forgiveness when I really didn’t do anything wrong. Am I the asshole for going on dates after a break up?

1p35gfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Money/comments/1p35gfo/advice_for_fellow_teens_with_littleno_expenses/,Advice for fellow teens with little/no expenses,"Hello!

TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM!!!!

Im 16M with a $15.75 an hour job, pulling in around $600 every other week (paycheck is biweekly), and I have almost no expenses. The only common expense I have that is actually important is a dental plan through my job (gives me a giant discount and free cleanings). 

But, even after that, I’ve still got a ton of money. What I do is I immediately go to my banking app (or bank) and transfer half of that into savings. Especially if you have a car, shit happens, and saving is a good habit to have. Then, I still have a couple hundred. 

This time in history is filled with advertising everywhere at all times. It’s on TV, on your phone, on the radio, it’s everywhere. And some of those advertisements are for shit you don’t need, but still might want. For example, I saw a cool RC car on Instagram for $50. Do I own any RC cars? No. Do I necessarily enjoy them? No. But a video showed how this one looks cool and does something unique and now I want it. What I do is I screenshot it/copy the link and paste it into my notes app. I just have a note titled “stupid shit”. Then, I continue with my day. If I see another thing, I do the same thing. Eventually, a holiday or birthday will come up. And no matter what you’ll get some money from family. Will it be close to your paycheck? Fuck no! Will it still be $50-$100 that you didn’t work for? YEP! So I deposit that into my card, go to my notes app, and see what I can afford. Then, I order it.


But what if I don’t want to wait? What if I have the urge to buy something like coffee or an energy drink (I’m a fiend for energy drinks). I buy them in bulk, or I buy instant coffee (or beans if you have a grinder). Even though spending $20-$30 on a little supply seems crazy, it still saves you money. For example, I like C4 Energy. I bought a 12 pack of drinks for $25. That makes each can $2ish. That’s at least a little better than spending $3 every day for 2 weeks. ESPECIALLY if you work night shifts like I do.

What about the larger impulse buys? Like clothes I don’t need or expensive shoes? I let myself buy ONE thing per paycheck that’s not needed. If that thing is >$100, I set aside half the price and buy it the next paycheck. Even if it’s something you’ll toss into your closet and forget about in a week, it’ll still help the urge.

I also save money for things like holiday breaks and the beginning of school each year, so when I go out with friends I won’t burn through that much money. And, I can buy something some new nice clothes for the new school year.



TL;DR - put half in savings. If you have a car/need to buy gas, then set aside enough money for that. If you regularly buy coffee/energy drinks, invest in a coffee grinder/case of energy drinks, or just instant coffee if you aren’t picky. Let yourself impulse buy ONCE per paycheck, as long as it’s under $100. If it’s over $100, wait until next paycheck. Try not to save your card info onto anything online, it just makes it easier to dump money down the drain. Don’t touch savings unless an emergency/something important (you’ll be happy when you aren’t in debt because your shitty car broke down). Save money for vacations/gifts and set a spending limit. (For me it was $40 per family member in a family of 4 including me).

Happy savings 🗣️

As some of you may already be aware from reading my previous posts ([**HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepladiesDesigner/comments/1o9bvup/lets_talk_about_the_gate_general_advice_tips/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [**HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepladiesDesigner/comments/1oh4y0g/part_2_lets_talk_about_the_gate_pt_2_huge_haul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), I am a BIG fan of DHGate! I think it's convenient, reliable, and I want to spread the word that, YES, you absolutely can get good quality bags there.

So with that, I've seen a few posts recently from people wondering about buying classic Chanel flaps on DHG - and really, the only Chanel flap reviews I ever see are of bags from 187 or Blake or Rome or Genie.

What if I don't want to buy from a TS, or spend like $600 on a bag? Can I still get a good one from somewhere that isn't sketch?

The answer is YES - and I'm going to show you my Classic Flap collection, all purchased on DHG.

Before we begin -

* **I am not a Chanel expert, and I don't claim to be** *(LV yes, Chanel however, no)* so this review IS NOT comparing these bags to the auth versions or seeing how close to ""1:1"" they are, because frankly, I find that shit tedious
* SO - I'm grading these bags on overall quality, workmanship, and details - not how close to auth they are
* My grading criteria is going to be different than yours, because what matters to me may not be as important to you, AND THAT'S OK! Different people value different details
* In fact, I find it pretty hard to nitpick bags. Instead, if you've read reviews from me before, you'll see I go on mainly how the bag ""feels"" - which is subjective and nebulous, and I get that!
* However, I want to caveat that I do own several auth Chanel bags, so I am comparing these to those, but not in a ""let's count stitches"" kinda way

ALSO!

**Please be aware that while I have purchased each of these bags myself at full retail price with my own money, I am sharing affiliate links.**

**What is an affiliate link?** It's a link that is customized to me, so DHG knows that I shared it, and it pays me a commission (1-3% depending on the item) if you buy the item.

**Storytime!**  After I posted my last two DHG posts, I got an email from someone at DHG letting me know that my posts had generated almost $10K in sales, and did I want to join their affiliate program. What can I say, Repladies do NOT play when it comes to bags.

So, for every purchase you make on one of the links in this post, I will receive a **1-3%** commission on the sale price of the item, after your item is delivered to you, all of which will go right towards purchasing more bags from new sellers and thus more reviews.

**HOWEVER** \- ***let's be REALLY REALLY crystal fucking clear that I'm NOT doing this for the money***. It's time-consuming as hell writing these, and IF my goal was to make money, there are undoubtedly better ways to do it. I'm def not getting rich here, ok? **It's like $100-$200 bucks TOTAL at the end of the day.**

SO! There's like 6 inches of text, and we haven't seen one bag yet.

**To summarize, before we start, the overall point of this post is:**

* To show that you CAN get good quality bags on DHG, so hopefully one day ""DHG"" will stop being a synonym for ""ugly AF and made of plastic""
* To share DHG sellers that I've found reliable and that can actually deliver the goods, because there are 100s on there and some of them are TERRIBLE and should be avoided at all costs (and that's going to be a post soon, too)

We're going to start with the fun bags before we move into the classic colors, FYI.

**Price paid (includes shipping):** $260.38

**Rating:** 10 yams / 10

This bag ya'll - I literally gasped when I unboxed it. It's GORGEOUS. The suede is lush, soft, and smells so incredible. The hardware is the perfect contrast to the rich color and isn't too yellow. The details are perfect (it's chipped), the quilts have just the right amount of puff, and the lining is buttery soft leather. It's so soft and beautiful that I just can't stop smelling and touching it. I really LOVE a suede bag, and this ticks all of the boxes for me, personally. It feels heavy, like it's a high quality item, not light and flimsy - and that's important to me. I want these bags to feel luxurious when I handle them, like the luxury items they are - not like they're from Walmart. And this bag looks AND feels like a million bucks.

I recently bought a suede Balenciaga city bag, and a suede Gucci softbit (that I ended up rehoming bc it was too big on me) and I've noticed something about suede - if you get a lighter brown color, it can lean towards looking ""cheap"". I don't think this bag would work as well as it does if the brown was a lighter shade.

It's the color, and contrast with the hardware, that really make it look luxe!

**Rating:** 10 Yams / 10

Something about me: I LOVE VINTAGE DESIGNER ANYTHING. I collect auth vintage Hermes scarves, my mom has a killer collection of vintage auth bags that I'm constantly (trying to) steal, and I'm always searching Posh, Depop, TRR, and Vestaire (although...they actually kinda suck) for vintage Tom Ford-era Gucci or Phoebe Philo era Celine.

So when I saw that this seller, who I've bought Chanel bags from before and LOVED (ahem, my [Metiers D'Artes suede shopper](https://sale.dhgate.com/Mm7PMo71), my [top handle also from the 2025 Metiers D'Artes collection](https://sale.dhgate.com/M39s7m17), my [small C25 hobo](https://sale.dhgate.com/nfv25u66) which I'm reviewing next) also had this ""vintage"" Chanel in their store, I didn't hesitate and ordered one so quick my credit card had smoke coming off it.

Also, a confession: I haven't bought a bag from Blake yet. It's just SO HARD for me to justify $500+ on a rep (that's a me problem and you're probably normal and feel differently).

*""But TerribleYam""*, I hear you say, *""Why don't you just buy ONE bag from Blake/187/Rome, instead of 2-3 from DHG?""*

Because I want 2-3 bags instead of one, damnit.

I have no doubt that one day, as a lover of vintage Chanel, I will absolutely become a Blake collector. She makes some beautiful things and I already want them all. But that day is not today! I haven't reached the ""quantity vs quality"" point yet. Not that I don't want quality, but right now, it's quantity. There's too many bags on my wishlist.

So yeah anyways, this ""vintage"" bag.

THE LEATHER ajsasi;j;ifjfiajnfnfifskej8vu.

It's the first (rep) bag I've had that I'm legitimately afraid to scratch, dent, fuck up, etc. I'm ALREADY kicking myself because I originally stored her without pillows inside, and she started to crease (!!!)

But also - I keep reminding myself that it's meant to be a ""vintage"" bag and the best thing about those is the wear and tear and the character they develop over time. Personally, **I think a bag with obvious signs of use and/or flaws looks 100% more authentic than a ""perfect"" one.** That's kind of why people go nuts over slouchy Birkins - same thing.

So, I ADORE this bag, probably a teeny tiny bit more than the suede one, if I'm being completely honest. I love the flat quilts, I love the way it smells, I love the vintage hardware, I love....everything? about it.

I WFH and sometimes I'll just hold it during Zoom calls, ngl.

Oh yeah and I bought a black one too - it's on the way as we speak.

Now, for some color -

A medium 25cm Classic Flap in burgundy caviar leather with GHW, also from LuxuryDesignerBags1

[Oh, that color is chef's kiss](https://preview.redd.it/ad9quliuhj2g1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=336eda0e5cf5f71932d100f6412402fab2b3f193)

**Price paid (includes shipping):** $340.57

**Rating:** 10 yams / 10

For this bag, since I love burgundy and for me, it will be a ""classic"", I wanted the highest quality I could get that ISN'T 187 or GF. I talked to this seller to ask what the difference was between this bag, and other CF he had that were priced a bit less, and this one is from a better factory and is the ""new"" version. $340 is still pricey, but it's not $500+, so that was just fine for me.

And the bag - it delivers. I love it, and it FEELS luxurious and high-quality. Heavy chain, hardware that isn't yellow, luscious leather smell, soft sooooooft leather (I've noticed that cheap caviar = stiff caviar) this bag has it all! Since I already have a neutral nude CF and a (soon to be two when my vintage arrives) black CF, I wanted a color that I knew I'd get a ton of use out of, but wasn't a ""neutral"", and this bag is perfect. In some lights it's a more vibrant red and in others, it's a rich dark burgundy, which is exactly what I wanted.

10/10, no notes!

Now, these are purchases from a while back, but very much worth reviewing

A beige sheepskin 23cm Classic Flap with GHW, from Angelisdoll168

[She's a classic for a reason](https://preview.redd.it/mpp4lsdq0k2g1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7c975cea77fec58de3ab005956bb6132f3296a0)

**Link to Item:** [https://sale.dhgate.com/xbkDht95](https://sale.dhgate.com/xbkDht95)

**Price paid (includes shipping):** $249

**Rating:** 9.75 Yams / 10

Oh, I love this bag. My post office LOST IT for almost 10 days (I have a PO Box everything goes to and the tracking said ""placed in box"" but I never got it) and I was about to file a claim when it magically showed up one day! OMG the relief - I felt like someone stole my car and brought it back.

I'm also strictly a caviar girlie, because I think it wears better for an everyday bag, and I also think the rep caviar looks better than sheepskin, on the whole. Sheepskin, in my opinion, is easier to tell if it's lower quality vs caviar. Low quality caviar won't look as ""bad"" as low quality sheepskin will. So, I wouldn't normally have ordered sheepskin from this seller, I probably would have gotten it from the other seller above. But I guess I felt like rolling the dice when I placed this order, because I broke my own rules apparently.

Let's talk about Angelisdoll/GucciBB for a second.

IMHO, this seller is solid for mid-tier bags - not the highest quality you can get, but still good! The prices are more than reasonable for what you get - she offers a ton of colors, and similar pricing on Boy bags (I had one from her that I rehomed that I was super happy with) and C19 bags (want to try one for repscience!).

Another thing about Angelisdoll - you'll notice 90% of her items are priced at $302 - that comes down to $280 (with shipping already included) with an automatic coupon. Some of her items are a really good deal at $280! Others you can find cheaper elsewhere, so do your due diligence!

Back to the review - when I got the bag, I actually didn't love it right away. It felt stiff, the leather felt low quality, and the color was very yellow. In fact, I was debating just rehoming it and buying another from a different seller.

HOWEVER - now that I've conditioned it twice with leather honey, it's seriously grown on me. It REALLY needed conditioning, and now it feels much softer, like good quality leather should. The color has also grown on me, and I realized I was being way too picky. Once I got out of my own head (and saw how great the leather looked post conditioning) I grew to love it. So that's the reason for the -0.25 rating deduction! I will def not be rehoming this.

And lastly, my old favorite

A 30cm Jumbo Classic Flap in Black Caviar with GHW, also from Angelisdoll16

[The most used bag in my collection, TBH](https://preview.redd.it/tngr20j8qj2g1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5de4d9b04697ee077add5921b63c27c699ddafa1)

This bag is my bff

I took a 2-3 year break from reps after RIPLadies disappeared. Didn't buy a single rep during that time - EXCEPT for this one

I don't know what demon possessed me that day in September of 2022, but it was post-COVID, my bday was coming up, and I was determined that I was finally going to get a black Jumbo. I tried contacting a few old sellers and quickly discovered that I actually didn't have any current seller contacts lol - so I did what any completely normal person would do, and hopped on DHG for some risky shopping.

I can't remember why I bought this bag specifically out of 100s of other similar listings, but I figured that for the price, I would (hopefully) at least be getting something made out of leather and vaguely resembling a Jumbo CF.

A few weeks later she arrived and I swear to god it felt like I won the lottery, ya'll

Yet another to mention about this seller, Angelisdoll/GucciBB - they ship everything in boxes with the correct color dust bag (white for classics, black for seasonal), the felt protectors for the bag, AND all of the ephemera. That means - a big Chanel book wrapped it glassine, a shopping bag, branded tissue paper, a ribbon & camellia, several receipts in a receipt folder, note cards, etc etc etc. After being out of the rep world, the goodies were fun.

And the bag - I've used this bag more than any other in the past 3 years, and I have to say it's aging beautifully. The leather has gotten softer and more broken in, it's developed some beautiful crinkles, and the shape of the bag has 'relaxed' if that makes any sense. The chain (which is heavy) glides beautifully, and it's looking great for a 3 year old rep. I'm not a person who is ""careful"" with my bags, either - they're meant to be used, and I use them. In fact, I may have even thrown up on my auth speedy on my 21st bday (TMI? It ended up being fine and I still have it lol)

I've also worn this bag into a Chanel boutique and felt completely fine (no side-eye from SAs, and believe me, I'd know - I was one), I've worn it to the bar at the Rosewood Sand Hill, I've worn it to the Lazy Bear, I've worn it to the bar at the Ritz in Tahoe...like, I've def worn it places where auths are and no one blinked twice (also, you're welcome for the mini tour of ""Yam's favorite spots in NorCal for a weekend getaway"")

Like I mentioned earlier, I think bags that show some wear look **WAY MORE auth/believable** than bags that look so perfect, like they just came out of a box.

And I think that's because A). most ""wealthy"" people (at least, the ones I know) who are buying auths are buying them to actually USE them and B). most people don't expect a rep bag to actually age - I think the assumption is that older reps are going look beat to hell and falling apart at the seams, because they're inherently lower quality. So when you see a rep that's actually aged gracefully, I think most people are going to assume it's auth - but that's just my personal opinion/take.

Anyways, eventually I do actually plan to replace this bag with one from 187 (gasp, yes, even after I've shit-talked them this whole review). With the amount of use I get out of this bag, it just makes sense (girl math). But I'll always keep this bag. I'm sentimentally attached now.

**SOOOO - now that we've seen 5 bags from 3 sellers, what's the difference?**

Not much, TBH.

I'm not doing a side by side comparison, but in my humble opinion:

* While still lovely, both CFs from Angelisdoll feel slightly less in quality than the two from LuxuryDesignerBag1 - but I can't put my finger on exactly the reason why?
* If I had to say SOMETHING, I'd say that the Angelisdoll bags construction isn't as good, and the leather quality isn't as good - they're def mid-tier
* THATS NOT TO SAY I DONT LIKE THEM! Mid-tier is just fine for me!
* In fact, I think $249 for a 23cm CF from Angelisdoll is an absolute STEAL and I was gatekeeping this info for literally years lol. I actually plan on ordering a hot pink CF from Angelisdoll, like, tomorrow
* But for classics/neutrals, I would pay the \~$50 more and get the slightly better quality version from LuxuryDeisgnerBags1
* That suede CF is in a class by itself, OK? It's STUNNING
* The factory photos of it on DHG **have the same background** as the factory photos of my brown Vintage CF and you know what that means, ladies! SAME FACTORY!
* For $260, the suede CF is a total no brainer and if you love fall bags, suede bags, and/or Chanel, DO IT

Well, if you've read this far - wow, seriously, thank you. I know I'm very wordy and could have made this much shorter, so thanks for hanging in there until the end.

What's next?

* C25 comparison - XC vs. DHG
* Side trunk comparison - Rainbow Bags vs. TS vs. a $90 DHG version
* Buyer's agents 101 - how to use Superbuy, AllChinaBuy, etc.
* Another Rainbow Bags review - seasonal/fun LV items (Catorgram, mirror, and sequins!)
* Charms and Accessories haul review! Spoiler alert: I'm pretty sure the charms you get from your TS and the ones on DHG come from the same place
* Yes, I do actually have a TS that I love - an Allen haul review

And of course, whatever else you want me to write about, I will! Just let me know. If you can't tell, I LOVE BAGS, so no, I don't mind spending 3+ hours on these. I could talk/write about bags all day.

Let me know what other questions about DHG I can answer to de-mystify it and encourage more people to try it out - and if you buy anything I recommend, I want to see a review!!! Share with the rest of the class, please.

Also, we can't end without updated versions of these!

Well, I did exactly that. And the silence is well thats all I got.

I built a Chrome extension called **Campaign Finder**. It’s not some wrapper around ChatGPT. It’s a tool for Amazon Influencers. It automates the absolute worst part: manually cross-referencing their storefront products with Creator Connections campaigns.

**Here is what the tool does (that apparently nobody cares about):**

* It scrapes and **scans their ASINs** automatically.
* It matches products to active campaigns instantly.
* It literally **spots unclaimed earnings** that they are leaving on the table.

I’m not selling a vitamin. I’m selling a painkiller. I am selling them a tool that finds them money they are currently losing.

I priced it at **$2.99**. Less than a coffee.

The result? Nothing.

I spent hundreds of hours dealing with Amazon’s chaotic DOM changes, optimizing the matching algorithm so it doesn’t crash on 100+ ASINs, and building a clean UI. I thought, *""Once they see they can double their commissions (like my beta tester Nicole did), it’ll go viral.""*

Instead, I’m sitting here refreshing my Stripe dashboard looking at a big fat zero, wondering why I spent my nights and weekends coding this instead of just watching Netflix like a normal person.

Maybe the UI is ugly? Maybe the copy is bad? Or maybe the whole ""build it and they will come"" narrative is just survivor bias from the top 1%.

1p35825,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TrafficMasterB/comments/1p35825/cookie_exchange_hosting_casual_holiday/,Cookie Exchange Hosting: Casual Holiday Entertaining Made Easy,"Cookie exchanges create many casual entertaining options, rather than formal holiday dinners. They offer relaxed social opportunities, celebrating seasonal traditions without the overwhelming preparation demands required for exhausting, elaborate hosting. Cookie swaps can be stress-free gatherings that focus on connection rather than complicated logistics with some strategic planning.

**Casual Elegance Foundation**

How do I create welcoming without the formal fuss? [Handcrafted table runners](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/table-runner) set up beautiful beginnings for cookie displays without necessitating full formal table settings that feel out of place in casual afternoon gatherings among friends sharing seasonal treats.

Natural materials and quality craftsmanship in their construction show care and preparation without losing the casual feel that makes cookie exchanges fun and not daunting social obligations that demand too much.

**Sustainable Serving Solutions**

What display will work for several different types of cookies? [Eco-friendly tableware](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/tableware) such as multi-tiered stands, serving platters, and decorative boards create eye-catching displays for the cookies while eliminating much single-use waste that may conflict with home-baking values many cookie exchange participants are promoting.

Quality reusable serving pieces enhance presentation, making what is otherwise simple cookies into impressive spreads worthy of photographing and sharing while supporting environmental responsibility by eliminating single-use party supplies.

**Comfortable Seating Arrangements**

Where do guests congregate during swaps? [Sunbrella throw pillows](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/pillow) on seating throughout gathering spaces create comfy perching spots where guests can sample cookies, chat, and package their selections without requiring formal seated service that feels too structured for casual swaps.

**Display Strategy Planning**

How many cookies is each person to bring? Traditional cookie exchanges call for 6-8 dozen, so everyone goes home with a variety from all who contributed. Quantify expectations and avoid the awkward mismatch when participants who want variety feel disappointed.

Provide nice labels for recipe cards that encourage sharing beyond the event-many participants treasure new recipes way more than the cookies themselves, making documentation valuable exchange components.

**Beverage Pairing Simplicity**

What beverages go well with cookie tasting? Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and even apple cider offer some warm drinks that go nicely with sweet cookies without the need for involved cocktail mixing that makes afternoon entertaining too complicated.

The self-service beverage stations allow guests to refresh at leisure, minimizing host duties while allowing lingering that can help expand the social connection beyond a swift collection of cookies and departure.

**Packaging Station Setup**

How do the guests take this variety of cookies home? Provide areas, separated by boxes, bags, or containers, where participants package selections they have chosen from the combined offering. This structure keeps congestion at a minimum and also maintains orderly departure logistics.

Provide tissue paper, ribbon, or other simple embellishments that will allow guests to create attractive packages; in this way, cookie collections become gift-worthy presentations to share beyond the exchange event.

**Time Management Success**

What time works well for cookie exchanges? Afternoon times, like between 2 and 4 pm, accommodate many schedules and avoid meal service expectations that might complicate casual gathering objectives, mainly based on cookie sharing and socializing.

Two-hour windows allow lots of time for sampling and catching up without running into evening hours that may conflict with dinner obligations or other holiday commitments during busy December schedules.

**Dietary Consideration Planning**

How do I accommodate food restrictions? Request advance notification of major allergens present in contributions, allowing guests with restrictions to make informed sampling choices without awkward interrogation during the event.

Consider designating allergen-free zones on display tables to prevent cross-contamination for guests who have serious allergies but still wish to take part in the cookie exchange tradition despite dietary limitations.

**Recipe Sharing Encouragement**

Why document cookie recipes? Recipe exchanges often become as valuable as the cookies themselves, with participants discovering new holiday favorites that they will continue to bake for years to come and making lasting impact beyond single events.

Provide appealing recipe card templates or ask participants to bring printed copies to share; in this way, the take-home items are tangible in value as future baking inspired by the discoveries made in the exchange.

Set the scene for stressless cookie exchanges with handmade table runners, Earth-friendly tableware, and Sunbrella throw pillows that prove casual holiday entertaining can be beautiful and comfortable, all while eliminating the stress formal gatherings create on already demanding seasonal schedules.",1,1763747215.0,u_TrafficMasterB,0,1.0,False

I’d appreciate any suggestions on where people usually meet others these days, whether there are any active social clubs,  and if apps like Meetup are actually a thing here. I’m genuinely out of touch with the city, so I’m open to anything that helps me get a feel for the place again.

Listen that funds didn’t go in, and i have things to get tonight for tomorrow. I need funds.

You told me i could be a stay at home mom for as long as i want and right now i feel like a maid or a side piece having to ask you for pennies.

I’ve been waiting years for Satisfactory to finally come to console. I deliberately avoided all videos, guides, and streams because I wanted my first experience on PS5 to feel completely fresh. And even with my expectations being ridiculously high after all this time… I have to admit, the game still blows them out of the water. It’s absolutely incredible.

I just want to take a moment to thank Coffee Stain Studios for creating what is honestly one of the best games I’ve ever played in my life. I also want to thank the PC community for “testing” this game for so many years, giving feedback, and helping shape the game into such a polished experience for us console players.

Here are a few screenshots from my current save. I’m sitting at about 140 hours so far. As I mentioned, I’m trying to build a factory that runs at 100% efficiency while also keeping things organized and avoiding conveyor spaghetti as much as I can (lol). Since I’ve never watched any tutorials, I’d really appreciate opinions from both veteran players and new console players on how my setup looks so far (preferably without spoilers!).

Again, thank you Coffee Stain for this masterpiece. I’m only at the beginning of Phase 4, so I’m excited knowing I still have tons of hours left to explore, build, and probably break everything before fixing it again.

I use an aeropress currently, so my cups of coffee are around 10oz right now - I wouldn't mind that being close to 12-16oz though, which is why I was looking at a Moccamaster - plus, we have family visiting sometimes and would be nice to have the option to do larger brews. 

But I'm a bit worried that it won't function well for smaller batch brews? Obviously the Cup One would be an option, but that wouldn't be as convenient when guests are over. I read that the KBGV recommends at least a half pot, which appears to be 20oz, I'm guessing due to needing at least some minimum amount of coffee to get ideal ""pourover"" mechanics with the water.

Print a catalog. It gives you plenty of space to tell your story - any story - in an accessible, familiar, tangible way:



Unlike emails and digital ads, a catalog sticks around - on desks, coffee tables, even conference rooms. It cuts through the noise and makes your business look serious and credible. And here’s the magic: people love flipping through them. A tactile experience is the smartest way to get noticed, remembered and connected. 



To design an effective catalog, do this:

* **Focus on the cover:** Make it impactful, memorable and instantly recognizable as your brand.
* **Play with interior layouts:** Create a variety of layouts that make your content easy to browse and understand.
* **Highlight your strength:** Love images? Use a lot of them. Great at graphics? Add them on every page. Whatever your brand does well, show it off.
* **Integrate both print and digital:** QR codes are the perfect bridge back to your online store and bring engaging components of your website to customers’ fingertips. Consider creating a digital version of your catalog, too.

I did two very fancy internships and a 10 months of a full time job with an American consulting firm, and even before my European experience i had 2 years of work experience in my home country. last year they laid me off. I have experience in business and sustainability, international partnerships, Programme management and advocacy campaigns. I have been trying for a year and half to find a job after i got laid off. I have full rights to work in France, my French is improving i am not business fluent yet. A year and half later i feel like i need to pivot of do some courses or upskilling to move away from the over saturated job market. I have applied for 100+ jobs, not just cold applying - finding recruiters and hiring managers, messaging them privately, sending out cold emails, coffee chats, - you name it i have done it. I have done multiple interview processes that has 6to 7 rounds in some truly international and reputed organizations several times only to be rejected in the end to say they found someone else who had a random skillset a little more than me. I am at loss here- what should i do now? I don't want to go back to my home country - i am married to my French partner with whom i love my life. I cannot also be sitting idle at home while i have done a lot for my career. Can anyone tell me what kind of upskilling or pivoting can i do now.

1p34ooq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health2020/comments/1p34ooq/my_mounja_burn_liquid_drops_review_does_this/,"My Mounja Burn Liquid Drops Review: Does This ""Miracle"" natural mounjaro solution Really Work?","**My Rating: 1.5/5 Stars**

If you're scrolling through social media and seeing those lengthy promotional videos for Mounja Burn, I need to have a frank conversation with you. As someone who's spent years studying weight loss supplements and their actual effectiveness, I have to tell you—this product falls seriously short of its bold claims.

**The Bottom Line Up Front**

I would not recommend Mounja Burn liquid drops for weight loss. While the ingredient list contains some traditionally used herbal extracts, the proprietary blend format means you have no idea what you're actually getting, and real user reviews and experiences I read, tell a very different story than the marketing hype.

**What Real People Are Experiencing**

One person waited a full five weeks to give this product a fair shot. They noticed some appetite suppression initially, but they were also exercising and eating keto. After dropping 5.5 pounds over four weeks, they stopped taking the drops entirely and *continued losing weight at the same rate*. Translation? These liquid Mounja drops weren't doing anything. The diet and exercise were responsible for the results.

Another user had high hopes after seeing that same promotional video we've all encountered. They dropped 6.4 pounds in the first three days (likely water weight), got excited, then watched their weight fluctuate up and down for the remaining 27 days. By day 30? Right back where they started. That's not sustainable fat loss—that's your body's natural weight fluctuation.

Then there's the quality control issue. One customer received a damaged bottle with scratched labels and signs of leakage. It arrived late, the shipping was mishandled, and they were too nervous to even open it. If you're spending your hard-earned money on a supplement, you deserve better than that.

**What I recommend instead?**

If you're interested in natural GLP-1 support, I would suggest looking into ***berberine*** (500mg, 2-3 times daily) which has shown promising research for blood sugar regulation and may naturally stimulate GLP-1 secretion.

Another evidence-based option is high-quality fiber supplements like ***psyllium husk or glucomannan,*** which can naturally boost GLP-1 production through gut fermentation and have the added benefit of promoting satiety—just make sure you're drinking plenty of water with these.

**Here is a must read article on current, recommended natural GLP-1 supplements-**

[**https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/master-list-of-natural-glp-1-supplements/**](https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/master-list-of-natural-glp-1-supplements/)

 

Curcumin with black pepper extract has also demonstrated metabolic benefits in clinical studies

 

**The Suspicious Marketing Problem with natural Mounjaro alternatives**

If you're seeing glp1 products like these, everywhere on Reddit and social media, that's not organic buzz—multiple users report suspicious amounts of fake reviews and coordinated promotional comments on reddit and social media.

When a company needs to manufacture enthusiasm artificially, that should raise immediate red flags for you.

**Breaking Down the Ingredients in Mounja Burn**

Let's talk about what's actually in this 121mg proprietary blend:

**Gotu Kola Extract (Leaf):** Traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for cognitive support and wound healing, but I haven't seen compelling evidence connecting it to significant weight loss.

**Chinese Hawthorn Extract (Fruit):** Known for cardiovascular support and potentially aiding digestion, though its role in fat burning is questionable at best.

**Horse Chestnut Extract:** Typically used for improving circulation and treating varicose veins—not exactly a weight loss powerhouse.

**Stone Root Extract (Root):** Another circulatory herb that's more about vein health than metabolism.

**Motherwort Extract:** Historically used for heart palpitations and anxiety, but if you're expecting fat loss from this, you'll be disappointed.

**Butcher's Broom Extract (Root):** Similar to horse chestnut, this is primarily for circulation—seeing a pattern here?

**Grape Seed Extract:** A decent antioxidant that may support heart health, but its weight loss effects are minimal at the doses typically found in supplements.

**The Proprietary Blend Problem**

Here's what really frustrates me: that entire ingredient list adds up to just 121mg total. That's barely anything. A single cup of coffee has about 95mg of caffeine alone. When companies hide behind ""proprietary blends,"" they don't have to tell you if you're getting 100mg of one ingredient and 1mg of all the others. If you're serious about weight loss, you deserve transparency about what you're putting in your body.

**How to Use Mounja Burn (If You Insist)**

The label indicates a 2ml serving size with 30 servings per container. If you're determined to try this despite my reservations, here's what I'd suggest:

* Take the recommended 2ml serving once daily, preferably in the morning
* Combine it with a legitimate calorie-controlled diet and regular exercise
* Track your actual results objectively—weigh yourself weekly at the same time
* If you see no independent results after 4 weeks, discontinue use

But honestly? I'd recommend you skip this step entirely and invest that $30 in something more worthwhile.

**Pros**

* Contains some herbal extracts with traditional medicinal uses
* Liquid format may be easier to take than pills for some people
* Relatively low price point compared to some weight loss supplements

**Cons**

* Proprietary blend means you don't know actual ingredient amounts
* Real user experiences show minimal to no weight loss effects
* Quality control issues with shipping and product condition
* Suspicious marketing practices with fake reviews flooding social media
* No clinical studies supporting the specific formulation
* Most ingredients have weak or non-existent evidence for GLP-1 boosting and weight loss
* Results appear entirely attributable to diet and exercise, not the drops

**My Recommendation**

If you're looking for real, sustainable weight loss, I would strongly encourage you to invest your time and money elsewhere. The 80/20 approach —80% nutrition, 20% exercise—is actually backed by science and will serve you far better than these drops.

Instead of spending $30 on Mounja Burn, consider:

* Investing in quality whole foods, adding in more fiber
* Getting higher quality fiber supplements, berberine or other GLP-1 supplements
* Purchasing a food scale to track portions accurately
* Joining a legitimate fitness program or gym

The truth is, there's no shortcut to sustainable weight loss. If you're serious about losing weight, focus on creating a modest calorie deficit through whole foods, consistent exercise, and behavioral changes you can maintain long-term. I know that's not the exciting answer those social media videos promise, but it's the one that actually works.

I don’t recommend Mounja Burn. Save your thirty bucks. Your future self will thank you.

1p34h1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Strange_Deer_6546/comments/1p34h1l/really_long_vent_bout_my_current_friend_group/,REALLY LONG VENT 'bout my current friend group://,"Hi, I'm a NEET'26 aspirant, and I'll confess first and foremost that I'm **NOT** the brightest one out there. This is just a vent 'bout (more like against) some of my coaching institute friends. Let's refer to them as X, Y, and Z for now.

Basically, I am part of a small friend group of four girls at my institute, and frankly speaking, two of them are above me academically, and one is below. We are all droppers, and the one who's academically weaker than me is on her 2nd drop, while the rest 3 of us are on our 1st (hopefully last too) drop. We sit close by, obv. So X and Y are the smarter ones, and they have known each other briefly before as friends, so naturally they are closer, and no, it's not JUST about me feeling left out, but please hear me out! 

So Z lowkey is clingy towards Y, her reason is that mid lectures whenever she has some doubt and all, and she needs a quick study-related talk buddy, n she HEAVILY relies on Y. I have no issues with that tbh, but it definitely sounded so ridiculous at first when I noticed that whenever Y was absent, Z used to feel \*bored\* because she has NO ONE to talk to besides the point that I have tried to initiate convos with her every now and then during our breaks regarding topics of our common interests like:

1. I'd show her some cute pairs of shoes, outfits, n all from pinterest.
2. Talked about my fav coffee (we're both coffee lovers, even tried a coffee suggestion from her)
3. Showed her a cute lip gloss brand I found online.
4. Talked 'bout other miscellaneous and academic and non-academic stuff.

So yeah, wtv, that's fine. I'm terrible at fitting in or even maintaining friendships, so idk what to do, really. Personally, I'm not an interesting person to talk to since I SUCK at initiating convos. Some days, Z and I have had really good, hearty convos as well, but they are a lot rarer imo. 

So even on days when Y is present, I’d often feel left out because they’d be so engrossed with each other, asking and solving each other’s doubts (which I understand why they’d not rely on me), and embarrassingly enough, I’ve tried to seek validation from them (in some way?), idk how to explain that. 

Anyway, that's a lil sneak peek of Z and Y now about X.

Listen ik I am nowhere in a position to judge or make assumptions about anyone, and it's quite rude to say this, but she likely won’t clear NEET’26 either. HEAR ME OUT! 

I’ve often had her complain to me about how sleepy and boring the class is, and wtv, and which I’d understand, esp for classes like OC or physics, but the thing is, even when the class isn’t boring or when we are starting a brand new topic completely unrelated to the previous ones even then she won’t bother paying attention. I’m also lowkey annoyed of hearing her complain about backache and all (tbh she has never mentioned bout having any back injury or anything of that sort) THAT TOO MID LECTURE!!!! Like the teacher is literally explaining how to do a question/solving a query/ teaching a topic, and she’d be interrupting me for something I CAN'T F\*\*KING SOLVE!!!!!!!!!! And trust me when I tell u this, she puts less effort into her neet prep than a billionaire in solving world hunger. I recall one of the days a few weeks back during our OC class she forgot her OC notebook but she had a rough notebook so IF SHE WANTED TO she could’ve easily jot down wtv was being taught in class which was mainly some practice questions and very less theoretical part/conceptual part and our sir had already sent a digital copy of the practice ques. Which he had told us to write beforehand so that we’d spend less time in class “copying questions off the board”. And tbh she did start to jot down at first and then got bored or wtv mid lecture and just stopped! Started playing on her phone, not even listening to the teacher or just maybe trying to silently solve the questions, and guess what? Later on, during the break after class, she tells me to send her a PDF OF MY NOTES! Like 7-8 pages (ik that’s not a lot, but the no. of times I’ve had to send PDFs to her because she didn’t write something, didn’t pay attention, got tired, her hand started hurting and all), and it all falls on me to send her notes! 

This rant session is mainly about Y and X tbh, because today both of them have separately asked me to send them an entire OC chapter’s notes… and yk why they want mine? Because I was present in class and attended all of them? NO NO NO NO because out of habit, I make my notes pretty (and colorful) and fill up my margins with extra EXTRA explanations, even the simplest ones that the teacher mentions. I guarantee you one thing that my notes are really detailed! (also for the fact that my OC was quite weak in my first attempt, and I’m not trying to repeat that mistake). I have never minded sharing my notes, but man, there's a limit! I’ve always been a people pleaser, and no way in hell can I fix that in one day or a week, but this just feels too much!! Tbh i don’t feel quite included in Y and Z’s duo and X is just friendly and actively outgoing with nearly half the class and I don’t mind being a loner but since they (Y and Z) never bother even including me in their academic related talks for eg 2 weeks ago I overheard Y telling Z about some discrepancies on our notes and the NCERT textbook data and I’m sitting right next to her but she didn’t bother including me or sharing it with me but she’ll readily come by asking for a 20+ page pdf of my notes like wth man… Ik they both are smarter and all, but do I really have to be just a note-taking “friend” for them? Like, I am in NO WAY THAT DUMB that you can’t even bother sharing a lil “secret” with me.

During our break today X told me to send her the OC chapters’ entire pdf and i said that’ll be too long and subtly denied hoping she won’t push but she made me snap pics from her notebook and told me to find these topics in my notes and forward wtv the work was done between those 2 topics and mind you she has no reason to have incomplete notes esp for OC given the fact that she has attended nearly all the classes of the chapter except for like 2 for which I had sent her the notes for THAT VERY SAME DAY! And also, Y just texted me like an hour ago to send me that same entire chapter’s PDF, which is easily more than 30-40+ pages worth of content. I have her currently left on delivered and plan to keep it so till tomorrow, and then I’ll text her that the PDF would be too long and the same reasons that I did for X. Hopefully, by that time, she will’ve bothered Z for the notes. 

Honestly, one thing that I really admire (or am envious of) about Z is not just that she’s smart and bright and quite confident or her ability to grasp concepts, but the fact that how approachable she is! It could also be the fact that she’s been in this institute since the 11th, and I’ve joined just this year, but still! She’s cool, we have plenty of common interests and would’ve loved to stay in contact with her even after we go our separate ways next year, but I don’t wanna come off as too pushy, nor do I wanna put one-sided efforts to make myself feel included when anyone from outside can tell that I’ll never fit into their “DUO”. Also the fact that throws me off sometimes is that she does have a mild ego issue (if u can even say that), during doubt sessions of some sessions when someone else is asking a doubt and if it is a slightly simpler doubt not like a JEE advanced level 3000 kinda doubt she’d snicker/ make a shady remark “That’s such a simple ques why would u ask that?” Like miss girl we all paid the fee and everyone has the right to ask their doubts even if they are silly! Like all ur fellow friends are in medical colleges and only ur left behind, so u FAILED, neet as much as the person asking a silly doubt,t let’s not have an ego! 

Recently one of subject teachers was mentioning how our batch was a bit (it wasn’t a bit) behind on our scheduled syllabus and next day she was ranting bout how stupid the teachers and all are on wasting a day on diwali celebrations and not teaching on that ONE PARTICUALR day which I’d agree if we were like a few days behind but we’re atleast 3 weeks behind on our syllabus which would have no way been compensated by studying one single day! Esp the fact that she was super hyped on that specific day despite b\*tching ‘bout it being a waste of time the day before and after the celebration day. She had the option to stay at home and do self-study instead of staying later than usual institute timings to celebrate even MORE. But she chose not to! I feel like that’s quite hypocritical, but I don’t hate her for that. But it was indeed quite ridiculous to hear irl. 

Fun fact about Y is that we both joined this institute for the first time, even tho she had some friends who recommended her this coaching centre, and I knew no one here, and she was the first to initiate contact with me, which I, as a (slightly) socially awkward person, appreciate a lot! And I’m not saying she’s a bad person overall, instead she’s a good company tbh (I’ve known and been part of bad company so ik what I mean) but sometimes it feels weird sitting with Y and Z esp it’s like I feel others gazes and them being able to clearly see me and tell that I’m no more than a benchmate for YZ duo. Like yk during exams and all, you get assigned to a benchmate temporarily, so u initiate convos with them and all? Yeah, that's how it feels on a lot of the days. It lowkey feels humiliating ngl even tho ik i’m thinking too much into it but I can’t just avoid them now nor do I want to but if I had the option to go back in time I’d clearly stay a lil away:////

Have a great room That we needed to have a projector set up and because we have bookshelves covering one entire wall.

Already installed 120-in screen. Seating is 13 ft away from the screen. 

I like the giant fan in the living room and didn't want a projector hanging down in the middle of the room. 

So my option seemed to be something on the coffee table which is 7' away.

something ceiling mounted in front of the fan which is also 7 ft away. 

Or something on the back wall behind the couch which is 18 ft away. 

I'm trying to find a nice projector for a decent price that would fit our setup.

Appreciate any help in this endeavor. 

I recently just bought a ancker nebula 4K SE on sale for $800 testing its use on a stand behind the couch. 

(Although I'm not sure I'm super happy with it. It has shut off once or twice, possibly because of overheating.)

It's for movie nights once or twice a week.

Overall, this month has been pretty good on the paid tiers! But *holy*, do we ever need to turn this *Pick of the Day* ship around. **A few of you in the Discord have floated some comical ideas to try and break the “POTD Curse”, including but not limited to:**

 

* Switching the *Pick of the Day* after it’s announced 
* Taking out the words, “of the Day” from each post 😂
* Changing the number of units on it to being the same as our other picks so that the “sports cursing powers that be” can’t tell the difference 🤔

 

I think it’s safe to say the superstitions are getting to all of us 😅

 

But having said that, play today’s *Pick of the Day* light if you are tailing, friends! I’ll be reducing it from half a unit to a simple quarter unit until things turn around.

The way I applied the wash was to do it pretty heavily with a big brush, let it settle for a few seconds, then go over the model with the brush to try to mop up the excess.

1p34fhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p34fhm/aita_for_not_wanting_my_partners_ex_included_in/,AITA for not wanting my partner’s ex included in every family holiday and celebration and removing her from the family group chat?,"Hi everyone I never post on reddit so might not be the right format but I really need outside perspective because I feel like I’m losing my mind.

My partner (31M) and I (31F) have been together a little over a year but were childhood sweethearts. I have 1 child from a previous relationship, and he has 3 with his ex (38F). They were together on and off for about 8 years, and because of that, she’s very much still intertwined with his family. His mom babysits their kids after school, she picks them up after work, and we have the kids every weekend.
Here’s where I’m stuck, I know she still loves him and wants him back. She has openly flirted with him before and even called him an old nickname she used to use for him. I made it clear that wasn’t okay, and since then she’s gotten more sly about it but I feel like I’m the only one who notices, and it’s making me feel genuinely crazy.
For example She’ll go in for coffee with his mom only when she knows he’s there but she never comes in when I’m in the house. She showed up to drop off the kids wearing last night’s makeup and kept trying to get his attention being overly friendly/flirty (I didn’t see this his sister did). She inserts herself into every family event birthdays, Christmas, Easter, everything- it’s usually an open invitation to the family group chat which she is still apart of. His family treats it like it’s normal because she was around for 8 years and they share kids, but every single family event she is there. I understand co-parenting I co-parent with my ex we have very minimal communication unless it’s about our daughter I respect his partner and she is a great step mum to our kid. I understand shared history. I understand not cutting ties completely. But am I wrong for thinking it’s weird to still be included in every holiday and family celebration when you’re the ex?
My partner and I have been arguing for days because I keep asking him to set boundaries. I feel disrespected by her behavior, but he says since he doesn’t notice her flirting, he shouldn’t have to say anything. And for the events his argument is, “I don’t invite her, so I don’t need to uninvite her.” But I feel like he genuinely doesn’t see the issue from my perspective, I’m trying to find my place in his family and it’s so hard when I feel like I’m competing with someone who’s been around for 8 years. And I just feel uncomfortable at every event whenever I’m at my in-laws I always feel so awkward with her around. 
The only person in his family who sorta gets it is his sister she’s admitted she knows the ex can be manipulative and has a history of doing anything to keep/get him back. But she won’t say anything because they work together and she doesn’t want drama. She used to be overly friendly with me like make a point of going out of her way to welcome me and say hi but now she knows I’m not going anywhere she barely acknowledges me or just a hi/bye thing. 

So… am I going crazy? Is this normal after a long-term relationship with kids involved? Or are my boundaries totally reasonable here?
I’d really appreciate any outside perspective. I feel like I’m going crazy but I’ve never been in this situation before so would I be the asshole if I stop her coming to family events and ask my MIL to remove her from the family group chat or at a minimum set boundaries. 

EDIT:
I want to clarify a few things based on some of the responses and after rereading my own post.
First, she was never actually friendly toward me. In the beginning, she acted overly sweet in this condescending, fake way the kind of tone that’s so obviously forced it makes your skin crawl. My partner wasn’t always the most involved father, and I’m the one who pushed him to spend more time with his kids and encouraged him to become more responsible with them. That’s why we have them every weekend now.
I also realized I made it sound like it’s normal or expected for her to be at every event. It isn’t. When she’s there, everyone is awkward, and she has openly admitted that she likes making me uncomfortable. I’ve never been rude to her, never tried to make things tense but she goes out of her way to behave like this.
For context, my partner and I were childhood sweethearts. We lost our virginity to each other, we grew up together, and she knew about all of this. He even called her by my name once when they were intimate. I’ve also known his family for years, and back then she refused to even speak to me because of my past relationship with him so when she suddenly acted “friendly” after we got together, I knew it wasn’t genuine.
My partner has had other relationships during the times they were broken up, and she did the exact same thing to all of those women. He’s cheated on a few of them with her, too. He knows the kind of games she plays, but he thinks that because he isn’t engaging with her or acknowledging her behavior, he doesn’t have to say anything or set boundaries.",6,1763745431.0,AITAH,47,0.64,False

I've been working on something that I think could revolutionize how people discover local food scenes, and I'd love your thoughts.

btw Im from the Philippines.

The Problem:

People struggle with ""choice paralysis"" when exploring food in new areas. Current apps show endless lists but don't create engaging, personalized experiences.

The Solution:

KusinaQuest creates personalized food trails based on your taste preferences, turning dining into an adventure game with achievements, XP, and social elements.

Key Features:

🎯 flavor profile matching

🗺️ Custom food trails with GPS navigation

🏆 Achievement system (like ""Coffee Master"" for visiting cafes)

📱 Social diary with photo sharing

📊 Gamified progression system

Current Status:MVP in progress

What makes this different:

\- Personalized based on actual taste preferences, not just ratings

\- Gamification creates habit-forming engagement

\- Focus on local food culture and authentic experiences

\- Built-in social proof through achievement sharing

Looking for:

\- Feedback on the concept and execution

\- Thoughts on monetization strategies

\- Potential investor connections

Would love to hear your thoughts! Happy to answer any questions.

This room is facing our backyard and is really a sitting room for our morning coffee or to read a book. It’s next to our kitchen on the side, and our dining table (behind the white doors). Right now it’s very empty and not cohesive.

I feel it desperately needs a rug and coffee table but I’m stuck on what shape that should be since it’s such an odd shaped room.

I’m already planning to update the cushions etc to be more cohesive but any tips you are willing to share, I’d love to hear!

I then use Mr. Coffee as my coffee machine. I use a reusable filter designed for this machine.

Values: empathy over ego, growth over gossip, craft over clout.

Seeking: an intellectually curious woman (21+), emotionally literate, open to slow-burn connection. Someone who lights up at a great question, a surprising insight, or a beautifully argued essay. Bonus if you enjoy museums, flea markets, quizzes, midnight desserts, or debating whether cities should be designed for cars or children.

What we can do: chai and a stroll through a bookshop; swap our top five life-changing reads; co-create a tiny fun project; or simply sit on a quiet bench and talk about the thing you can’t stop thinking about this week—economics, cinema, sport, design, psychology, poetry, cricket, F1—your pick.

Boundaries: safety first; no pressure to escalate; consent is culture; kindness is non-negotiable.

One thing I really liked is how well it blends in with other Lego modulars. If you line it up on a street it genuinely looks like it belongs there. The design style and height match nicely so it doesn’t look out of place at all.

A fun little feature is the awning at the front of the shop. You can actually move it up and down like a real shop, and it adds a cute touch to the whole display. Small detail but really satisfying.

And in case you're wondering I picked this one up from BrixBuilderStore. Overall a super fun build and definitely something I’d recommend if you’re into modular streets or just want a cosy coffee shop for your collection.

If you’ve ever left a conversation replaying everything you said like a bad movie trailer in your head, or if you're the person who mentally prepares for “small talk” like it's a hostage negotiation, same. This low-key anxiety in social settings is way more common than we talk about. And no, it’s not just “introverts being introverts.” The truth is, most of us never learned real social regulation skills.

Social anxiety, or just feeling tense in a group, isn’t always deep trauma or diagnosable disorder stuff. Sometimes, it’s just chronic overstimulation, perfectionism, or spending too much time online and not enough in actual, messy human interaction. And yep, TikTok and IG are full of BS social tips from influencers who read one book and now think they’re experts in “high-value conversation.” So I spent time digging into books, podcasts, behavioral research, and psychology tools that actually help. Here's what works, what science backs, and how to actually *feel* relaxed, not just *look* I like it.

*Let’s break it down like a chill, no-theory, no-cringe skill set.*

---

**Master your body before your words**

Most people try to fix awkwardness by overthinking what to say. Huge mistake. The key to chilling out socially starts *below* your neck.

* **Learn to regulate micro-stress in real time**  
  *A 2022 Stanford study* found that people with low social anxiety had strong interoceptive awareness, basically, they notice internal stress cues and act before spiraling.  
  * Try this: Before a social interaction, do the 4-4-8 breathing trick (inhale 4 secs, hold 4, exhale 8). It lowers cortisol fast.  
  * Keep your hands *below* your waist and shoulders down. It signals calm to your own nervous system.  
  * **Bonus:** Chew gum before going in. A University of Northumbria study showed it reduces stress and improves alertness.

---

**Shift your focus out of your own head**

Social discomfort thrives on self-surveillance. The more you watch yourself, the worse it gets.

* **Use the “Spotlight Effect” against itself**  
  Harvard psychologist Tom Gilovich coined this: we think people notice us way more than they actually do.  
  * Tip: Actively focus on the other person’s *eyebrows* when talking. It subtly shifts attention outward.  
  * Use curiosity as a cheat code. Ask one question that *you* I genuinely want to know. It forces your brain to listen instead of narrating your own performance.  

---

**Rewire your internal social script**

Most awkwardness is pattern-based. Your brain is expecting judgment, so it acts like someone’s watching. Time to rewrite that.

* **Book rec: ""Presence"" by Amy Cuddy**  
  This isn’t some TED Talk fluff. Cuddy (Harvard social psychologist) nails how body awareness, self-permission, and rituals can totally shift how you enter a room.  
  *She shows how people with strong “presence” don’t perform, they *believe* they belong.*  
  If you’ve ever felt like you’re performing in social spaces, this book will give you the tools to stop faking it and start *feeling it*.  
  *Best part? It includes rituals and positioning strategies that actually change how your brain reacts in real time.*

---

**Rehearse like an athlete, not an actor**

You don’t need to memorize lines. You need to train the *environmental reps*.

* **Podcast rec: “The Art of Charm” (especially episodes with Dr. Emily Anhalt and Vanessa Van Edwards)**  
  Both episodes break down *behavioral rehearsal*, how to prep for social settings the same way athletes visualize plays. Not scripts, but *responses*.  
  * Try this: Before a party or meeting, visualize *one* moment: shaking someone’s hand, laughing at a joke, holding eye contact. Your brain doesn’t know the difference between imagined and real reps.  

---

**Tech that actually helps you rewire, not just cope**

There are SO many apps out there claiming to “build confidence” but feel like generic meditation knockoffs. These ones actually adapt to behavioral patterns.

* **BeFreed**  
  This isn’t just another habit app. It’s a science-backed learning system created by a team from Columbia University. Think of it like Spotify meets Stanford psych lab.  
  It turns detailed research, expert interviews, and real-world strategies into short podcast-style lessons around *exactly* your social goal, whether it’s becoming more relaxed at parties, handling group convos, or building presence.  
  You pick how deep you want to go, 10, 20, or 40-minute sessions, and even the voice tone. It remembers what you listen to and builds a personalized learning roadmap over time.

* **""The Courage to Be Disliked"" by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga**  
  This book blew up in Japan and has quietly become a cult classic. It’s based on Adlerian psychology and written as a back-and-forth dialogue that makes it super digestible.  
  *It basically teaches you that trying to control how people see you is what creates half your anxiety.*  
  It’s not self-help fluff. It will honestly challenge how you see social approval, and give you a mental framework to stop over-identifying with people’s reactions.  
  *If you’ve ever felt like you’re not “enough” in a group unless you’re funny, smart, or likable, this book might rewire your entire vibe.*  
  Insanely good read. One of the few books that actually *reduced* my social anxiety just by reading it.

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Controlling behavior!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/LwNXtYOw6c)  **Oct 19, 2017**

My boyfriend and I started dating around a year ago, at the beginning of our senior year of college. We were friends for a while beforehand, and have mostly similar goals and values. We usually resolve conflict well; however, this is the one topic that we can't seem to settle.

I started competitive ballroom dancing 7 years ago after switching over from ballet. Since I first started, it's been a pretty big part of my life (at least 10 hours/week).  Though I don't plan on ever dancing professionally, it is really something I love and plan on doing for the foreseeable future. 

When my boyfriend and I got together, I was a part of my college's ballroom dance team. From the start, my boyfriend was uncomfortable with the fact that I danced with a male partner. We had a few disagreements over this, where he voiced his unhappiness but ultimately agreed to ""accept it even though he didn't like it"" when I explained to him how much ballroom means to me and how my dance partner and I had a purely platonic relationship (my college team explicitly banned all romantic relationships between partners anyway).

This was never really resolved, but my dance partner graduated one semester before me, and I started dancing as a leader (i.e. I danced the guy's part) with another girl for my last semester. I did this because my team had a shortage of guys and I thought it would be a nice way for me to stay involved with the team and to give another girl a chance to compete. I really don't enjoy dancing the leader/guy part and would not have done so if I had any other choice. During this time, my relationship with my boyfriend went smoothly, and he never brought up the male partner thing again.

After college, my boyfriend and I were both lucky enough to land jobs in a big city with a vibrant ballroom community. I was pretty eager to start looking for a new partner so I could start dancing as a follower (i.e. the lady's part) again. I had a fair amount of trouble finding a dance partner who was at my level, was the right height for me, had similar dance goals etc. so it was a while before I found a suitable one. Once I did, I told my boyfriend and he absolutely blew up. He had assumed that I would stop dancing after college like a lot of the members of my college team (including my partner) had and that I would give up my partnership search since it wasn't going well at first. He was really mad that I would be dancing with a guy again and demanded that I should find a girl to dance with instead (despite the fact that I don't like dancing as a leader and there aren't really any girls out there who are willing to dance as a leader). He accused me of trying to cheat on him even though my dance partner is engaged.

After a long fight, I convinced him to try ballroom dancing so he could maybe understand the partnership dynamic and so that we could dance together at parties. He seemed to enjoy it a lot so I was really excited for him. We've gone to a few social dances together where we danced with each other and it was all a lot of fun. A few days ago, my boyfriend expressed interest in going to a competition since his teacher mentioned that he thought he was ready. I was initially supportive, until I realized he expected me to compete with him. I explained that I was very excited that he wanted to compete, but unfortunately I would not be able to compete with him since we are at different competition levels and I planned on competing with my partner. My boyfriend got really mad at me for still choosing to dance with my partner after he had gone through all the trouble of learning ballroom dance for me. He thinks I tricked him and it isn't fair. But the reality is, he has only been dancing for a few months while I've been dancing over 10 times as long. Frankly it is a little insulting that my boyfriend seems to think that he is on a level to compete with me after just a few months. As much as I care about my boyfriend, I also care a lot about dance. I already took a semester off from seriously competing when my former partner graduated and really want to get back into it asap. In the future, once my boyfriend has developed more as a dancer, I would definitely consider becoming competitive partners, but not now.

Sorry for that huge essay, but what should I do? I am considering just breaking up with him but was wondering if perhaps I am being the unreasonable one.


  ---   


  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend and I constantly argue about the fact that my ballroom dance partner is male. Right now, he is mad that I am choosing to continue dancing with my dance partner even though he has started learning ballroom because we are not on the same level yet. Who is being unreasonable/what should I do?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Tenacious_E_28**

>He is allowed to have his boundaries/deal breakers. They might seem unreasonable to you (they do to me) but that doesn't mean they're wrong, per se. I think, though, that you are mismatched as a couple. Ballroom dancing is something that you love, that makes you feel connected to yourself in a positive way. You shouldn't have to give it up. So don't. Give up your boyfriend instead.

**OOP**

>> I think this is probably the best solution if we can't work things out. It isn't fair to him that I am always dancing with guys which makes him uncomfortable but it also isn't fair that I should have to quit.
>>
>> He told me that he thought I was being ridiculous as ""most guys"" would have a problem with me dancing, but I guess I'll just have to find one who doesn't.

**poop_giggle**

>>> Most guys would have a problem with you dancing with other men...if this was a club setting and you were bumping and grinding against each other.

>>> Ballroom dancing has an entire different atmosphere to it.

**potmeetsthekettle**

>>>>This is what I don't understand. This isn't even among the more ""sexual"" kinds of dance. Ballroom is pretty formal. Like c'mon.

[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7n6l7q/update_my_boyfriend_22m_of_1_year_doesnt_want_me/)  **Dec 31, 2017 (2 months later)**

I first came here a couple of months ago asking for advice regarding my boyfriend who hated the fact that I dance ballroom competitively with a male partner (who is not him).

I ended up sitting him down for a long conversation where we talked about why he felt uncomfortable with my dancing and discussed potential compromises. I apologized for not being clearer about dancing together socially rather than competitively and as a compromise, brought up a mixed-proficiency competition where we could dance together competitively (and made it clear that it was in ADDITION to continuing to compete with my partner until my boyfriend reached the level I compete at, which would take a few years). He was upset by this at first, but agreed if he could meet my partner and get to know him better. All in all, the conversation seemed promising enough that I decided to give my boyfriend one last chance.

I talked to my dance partner, and we set up a double-date (with my partner's fiancee) at a coffee shop. At the date, my partner's fiancee mentioned how she got much more comfortable with the idea of her fiance dancing with another women by watching them practice a few times (this was while my dance partner was dancing with someone else). My boyfriend thought this was a great idea and asked me if it was okay if he drove me to practice a few times on the weekends and watched. I agreed, but on the condition that he worked with my practice schedule and that he did not interfere in any way during our practice.

During the third weekend of this arrangement, he was in bed with a hangover Saturday morning at 9:30am when I had to head out for practice. I had reminded him the night before about my practice plans and had woken him up at 9am to remind him again, but he had refused to get up. So I told him it was okay and drove myself to practice. When I got back for lunch at 1:30pm, he was absolutely pissed. He accused me of sneaking around behind his back with my dance partner (even though I explicitly told him multiple times where I was going...?) and went on a rant about how it's so obvious that I am trying to cheat on him. He brought up how I held the door open for my dance partner during our double date and how my dance partner and I were ""smiling too much"" during our practices.

I was so sick of constantly feeling like I was doing something wrong that I finally snapped and broke up with him. That evening, my (now ex-) boyfriend blew up my phone about how he didn't think I was serious and that I was being unfair to him. He said I had to come back because I had agreed to compete with him. I responded that because I had given my word, I was still willing to compete with him at the one competition I had suggested earlier, but that's it. He got even angrier and said not to bother because ballroom dancing is stupid, I was a cheating whore for choosing dancing over him, and I would never find a guy like him (lol I really hope I don't...).

Breaking our lease cost a fair bit and moving was a hassle, but honestly it's been so refreshing not having to deal with constant arguments. It's a little lonely living by myself now sometimes, but it is so worth it to be able to live and dance on my own terms. Hopefully someday I will meet a guy who supports my dancing but only time will tell I guess.

**tl;dr:** Boyfriend and I argued about my ballroom dancing with a male partner. He refused to compromise and kept accusing me of cheating so I dumped him.

**OOP**

>>I'm sad that we ultimately weren't able to work things out, but it's probably for the best, I guess.

**daughter-of-durin**

>>>In my opinion - you were able to work things out but he wasn’t. Once it became inconvenient for him, he got angry at you despite you bending over backwards. Not your fault at all.

**anumati**

>It wasn't ""we"" who couldn't work things out, it was he.

**hc600**

>>Sometimes people will sabotage their relationship by making demands they don’t think their SO can meet, and if they do, they just come up with new demands. That’s what I think was going on here. OP was never going to satisfy him. If she quit dance there would have been something else.

**OOP**

>>>I think that's the thing that bothered me. It felt like he always seemed to come up with new expectations and demands whenever I would make a concession.

**~**

**TheRealJai**

>What an insecure guy. Hopefully you don’t find another guy like him. Congratulations, you’ll find someone better.

**OOP**

>>Thank you! I hope that someday I will. My ex insisted that most guys would not be okay with their girlfriends dancing with other guys, but I hope I will find one who is. Though in the meantime, I think I might just take some time to be single first.

**tsukiii**

>>>I used to dance in a professional ballet company (where we frequently danced with men), and almost all of the girls had boyfriends/husbands from outside the company. It won't be hard at all to find a guy who doesn't mind when you're ready.

""My name is Nathan. Nathan McKenna."" He responded kindly. 

""I'm Arlene Wayland but you can call me Mama Wayland or Mama Arlene ."" She said with a sweet smile on her pretty face. 

The bathroom door opened and Sarah slipped out wearing a hospital gown that seemed two sizes too big. 

""Hi, handsome stranger...I didn't get a chance to thank you earlier. I was kinda out of it. Still am to be honest..."" She said sorrowfully as she made her way back to her bed where she pulled the covers up to her waist. 

""His name is Nathan sweetheart."" Her mom corrected. 

""Well thank you, Nathan."" Sarah replied smiling weakly. 

""You're welcome. I hope you get better soon and can remember everything..."" Nathan said making a move towards the door. 

""Wait! My son wanted to thank you as well. He's out of state at university. When I got the call earlier...I told him right away..."" Arlene grabbed Nathan's arm gently. 

Arlene turned to Sarah, ""He's putting in an extended leave from school today and coming home. He'll video call us a bit later."" 

Sarah smiled as Nathan hesitated. He needed to get to work and develop the photos he had taken that morning, then stop by the Sheriff's Station with the recording. He really didn't have anymore time to stay, however, Mama Arlene was just so sweet. Her eyes sparkled when she asked and he suddenly found himself sitting patiently next to her on the small, uncomfortable loveseat that was under the large window in Sarah's room exchanging phone numbers and sipping hospital coffee from a small decorative paper cup. 

""What about Braxton Mama, and Chloe? Did someone tell them?"" Sarah asked...

Arlene stiffened, her happy eyes darkened, ""I have something to tell you about Braxton and Chloe sweetheart..."" She started.

The door of the room swung open wildly. An attractive, tall, muscular, chiseled face, brunette young man with blue eyes barged in. Behind him trailed a cute, chubby faced, black haired young woman with light brown eyes around Sarah's height but thicker, especially around her lower area. She pushed a sleeping, bundled up toddler in a stroller. She paused in front of the door and looked at Sarah, a look of surprise and worry frozen on her baby-like face like a mask. Arlene jumped up angrily. 

""Sarah?! Oh my God, so it's true...You're actually back!"" The young man spoke with tears in his eyes. 

""What are you two doing here?! Who told you?"" Arlene demanded. 

""Please Ms. Wayland. I'm sorry...I, I mean, we had to know if it was true. Half of the town is already talking about it."" He responded. 

""Sarah...where have you been...?"" The young woman asked anxiously. 

Sarah looked at both the young man and woman in silence, staring them both in their eyes blankly before smiling weakly. 

""Braxton? Chloe?"" What's going on? Whose baby is that?"" She asked. 

""Tell her!"" Arlene demanded shaking angrily. 

""Ms. Wayland, maybe this isn't the right time..."" Chloe spoke. 

""Right time for what?"" Sarah asked softly. 

""That's THEIR son Sarah! Your ""fiancé"" and ""best friend"" didn't even wait a year after your disappearance before sleeping together!"" Arlene shouted. 

Nathan felt frozen, he hadn't realized he had been holding his breath until he felt the paper cup still pressed against his lips though he had already finished the coffee. He lowered the cup and stood up slowly. 

""I'll give you all some privacy."" He said politely. 

No one paid him any attention as he realized Chloe and the stroller blocked the door. Chloe hadn't moved an inch and seemed stuck in that spot. 

""That's not fair! She left Ms. Wayland!"" Chloe yelled. 

Nathan stood there awkwardly and stared at the toddler who remained asleep through all of the noise. 

""She disappeared! She didn't leave, disappeared!"" Arlene yelled back.

""How old is your son?"" Sarah asked Braxton who was fully sobbing.

""He's... He's almost 2 and a half."" He responded sounding guilty. 

""Hahahahaha! So...I was missing what, about two months when y'all f•cked each other?!"" 

""Sarah...I can explain. We were so upset... Everything was so confusing"" Braxton started.

""Hahahahahaha! I already knew Chloe secretly liked you and was jealous of our engagement. She, I'm not THAT surprised about but you. Wow."" Sarah laughed again and leaned back. 

""Sarah...that's not true... or, or fair!"" Chloe stuttered. 

""I mean, did you even care when I went missing or were you secretly happy because Braxton was free?"" Sarah asked Chloe suddenly turning cold. 

Nathan's eyes darted between each person as sweat gathered on his forehead. He was suddenly very aware of his own heartbeat and the feel of his feet pressing against the floor. He didn't know what to do. Should he try and leave again though Chloe still blocked the door? Should he sit back down and stare out of the window nonchalantly? Maybe slip quietly into the bathroom and drown himself in the sink? 

""Sweetheart, calm down."" Arlene said rubbing hair from Sarah's reddened face. 

""Don't worry Mama, I'm very, very calm."" She replied. 

""Sarah...please...can we talk about this..."" Braxton started to plead. 

""No, get out."" Sarah interrupted. 

""Sarah, you're the one that left for almost three years! You could at least hear us out!"" Chloe argued. 

""I said, GET THE F•CK OUT!"" Sarah yelled angrily. 

The toddler finally awakened with a jerk and started whimpering lightly. He was cute, with the eyes of his Father and hair of his mother. A slender nurse knocked on the door cutting through the suffocating tension. Chloe's hand shook as she opened it. The nurse walked in and looked around the room. With a hand on her hip and a not so understanding look on her face, she explained they were way too loud and disturbing other patients. 

""There's also too many visitors in this room at one time."" She said sternly. 

""Sorry bout that, they're leaving."" Sarah said staring blankly at Chloe and Braxton. 

""Sarah..."" Braxton said desperately. 

""Let's go Braxton! OUR son needs you!"" Chloe said angrily and followed the nurse out of the room. 

Braxton looked at Sarah before turning to look at Nathan. He frowned finally realizing he was there the whole time. He watched Nathan angrily until he left out of the room. Arlene hugged Sarah tightly. Sarah smiled at her mother before turning her attention to Nathan. 

""Sorry about that. Well, that was embarrassing..."" She said looking down. 

""Oh, haha, don't worry about it. I came from the city. Trust me, I witnessed worse."" 

He thought about it quickly and that wasn't a lie. Sarah smiled softly as she slipped her right hand under the covers and sunk her nails into her thigh peeling back a chunk of skin.

Currently on 40 mg Vyvanse which gives me about 12-14 hours of effectiveness on the best days.

  
I also love caffeine. I think it's partially the ritual, partially the taste (just drinking plain water all day is so boring, man), and partially the added wakefulness and energy boost. I've recently started drinking it again about 2 hours after taking my Vyvanse (mainly 1 or 2 60mg servings of caffeinated crystal lite in water a day), and I've noticed that the effects depend on the day. Some days, the Vyvanse feels so subtle that a bottle or 2 of crystal lite is a nice boost to break up my day, while on other days, it feels like too much and makes me feel too wired, anxious, and eventually gives me a headache. 

The fun part is I'm not always able to tell whether drinking it will give me the push I need to get through my day, or if it will make me too wired. There are days where I've taken the gamble and chosen not to drink it for this reason, only to find myself crashing in the afternoon and hesitant to have caffeine that late since I also take the risk of not being able to sleep that night.

  
Anyone have any advice or have had similar experiences to mine? I've tried non-caffeinated options like decaf coffee, sparkling water, etc, but it isn't the same to my brain. For context, I am vegan but eat plenty of plant-based protein, especially first thing in the morning as I take my meds. I also work out regularly.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Portland Trail Blazers vs. Golden State Warriors: A Tale of Toaster Offenses and Coffeehouse Defense**

The Portland Trail Blazers and Golden State Warriors are set to clash in a battle that’s less “Space Jam” and more “Why Did We Bet On This?” The Blazers, fresh off a four-game losing streak that’s left them more deflated than a flat tire on a road trip, face a Warriors team that’s somehow both a well-oiled machine and a drama-filled soap opera. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many cups of coffee.

**The Odds: A Math Class You Can’t Skip**  
The Warriors are favored at -7.5 on the spread, with decimal odds of 1.31 (implied probability: 75%), while the Blazers hover at +3.6 (29%). That’s not just a spread—it’s a chasm. The total is set at 236.5, which sounds about right for a game where both teams shoot like they’re in a 3-point contest. Deni Avdija, Portland’s human highlight reel, is averaging 25.9 PPG, just 0.4 points shy of his over/under. But here’s the rub: the Blazers’ backcourt is missing Jrue Holiday (MIA, presumably searching for socks) and Shaedon Sharpe (injured, though no one’s sure if it’s a hamstring or a midlife crisis). Meanwhile, Steph Curry is averaging 27.9 PPG, which is basically a guarantee he’ll drop 30+ unless he’s having an off-night—i.e., scoring 25.

**The News: Drama, Injuries, and Coaching Changes, Oh My!**  
Portland’s recent storylines read like a reality TV show: a coaching change, a betting scandal (because nothing says “trust” like gambling on your own team), and a loss to the Chicago Bulls that was so close, you’d think the score was 121-120 in overtime. Avdija is the lone bright spot, but even he can’t outwork a lack of depth. The Warriors? They’ve got their own mess: Jonath

anyway, my thing is i have no idea whether he likes me back. he's an extrovert and can talk to just about anyone as far as i can tell. like he's really out there. so i kinda doubt the things he does that one may normally see as signs of attraction because it might just be that he's just LIKE THAT. i'm just gonna enumerate some of those things cause i need help interpreting this stuff LOL.

\- after the first day we hung out, he invited me right away to get coffee together again the next day. i said yes, and so we did, and that was the last time we hung out as of right now. it was only the third time we spent time together in person within two days (twice the previous day) but as we were separating he said ""tomorrow?"" as if it's... expected? like it was a given that we would also be hanging out the next day? (we didn't have any school the next day though unfortunately) IDK LMAO. this could just be platonic though cause i understand setting a routine with a new friend etc etc but he also does have a lot of friends with more similar/convenient schedules to hang with so idk idk!!!

\- (same day) he had won an election (it was an activity within their program) prior to us meeting. he told me that his teammates were out celebrating and/or planning to celebrate. i asked ""aren't you gonna celebrate with them?"" and he said nah this is how i'm celebrating and he sort of gestured to the coffee shop we were in. 

\- he sent me an instagram reel and it was like a clip of tinkerbell i think and a male fairy running around on some piano keys and i was like ""me and who"" and he replied ""could be us ngl"" LIKE WHAT

\- just today he told me he was cooking some pasta and i was like omg can i have some and he replied a bit later saying there's no more, then he offered to give me some ""next time."" which i thought was just a silly little joke but then a few hours later he messaged me asking when i want the pasta and i was so confused ???? but yes he was genuinely offering to cook pasta for me and bring it to school for me to try. (in exchange for a grilled cheese sandwich because i told him that was one of the few things i could cook.) does he always casually offer to cook pasta for his friends?? who knows???

\- we were playfully arguing about something and in the middle of me formulating my response he just goes ""i love debating you"" OUT OF NOWHERE

\- he plays a LOT of instruments and is really musically inclined. and one time i mentioned that i like to write. he asked if i could write lyrics to which i replied i'm not super good at that and he said that's okay, we should write a song together! Oh!!!!???

\- the nickname he set for me in one of our chats has this emoji 🥰 tacked onto the end but the nickname is ""shortie""

\- we've been texting each other good night more or less every night since we began talking. i sincerely don't know if this is a normal thing. i don't personally say goodnight to my friends a lot but it just so happens that my conversations with him last until bedtime and maybe he's just sweet enough to say goodnight to whomever he happens to be talking to at night

this is all i can list right now!!!! keep in mind all this is only within 5 days of knowing one another LMAOOO!! any advice/input would be much appreciated!!! thanks!",1,1763744119.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

when visiting the doctor, i’ve always been told that according to my BMI (i’m extremely obese). however, i’ve always looked at most a little overweight growing up but not noticeably morbidly obese. obesity, hypertension, and diabetes runs in my family (whether it’s both or either sides) and i personally have a medical history of digestive issues.

based on what i’ve learned thru tiktok (not the most reliable source ik), i’ve been thinking to avoid lifting heavier weights when strength training and focus more on cardio. i’m also considering incorporating low-impact exercises such as pilates and yoga while still strength training for my arms at least. i’ve found that in the past when trying to do both strength training for my upper and lower body, i don’t really notice dropping any weight and what i’ve been seeing is that building muscle can hide pounds from dropping on the scale.

these past few days, i’ve started to consistently go on 2 walks per day (30-minutes in the morning and 30-minutes in the evening) and use the stairs as much as possible at least when going down. i’ve also been incorporating an OMAD diet with a caloric deficit of 1500 calories while drinking as much water as possible, especially when i want to snack. at the moment, i start my morning with a cup of coffee and a piece of fruit, then my one meal for the day, and then a protein shake and maybe another piece of fruit if i have the calories to spend.

i mainly want to focus on how to achieve noticeable results in my appearance as quick as possible. i want to have a slimmer face (more defined bone structure, jaw, collar bones?, etc) and i would like to have smaller arms and legs because i’m happy with my hourglass figure. because of my genetics, i know my calves will be bigger no matter what (they are the part of my body that has the most muscle imo). i’m just trying to achieve a smaller build by slimming my thighs, arms, and face down.

I’m in the middle of tearing down my childhood bedroom and turning it into an actual adult living space where I can **work, chill, read, sleep, and maybe even add a mini-fridge + coffee corner**.

Right now the room is a total mess because I’ve disassembled all my old furniture. Here are some pictures of the current situation:

I’d really appreciate advice on **layout ideas, furniture choices, color schemes, lighting, desk setup, and how to make the room feel modern and functional**.  
I want something:

* minimalist but warm
* with a good work area
* comfortable for chilling/reading
* with maybe a small mini-fridge or coffee setup
* and a bed that doesn’t dominate the room

I’m also open to removing the big built-in shelving if needed, repainting the walls, or adding LED lighting.

What would *you* do with this space to make it clean, cozy, and practical for an adult guy living at home?

Is this normal? Is it because it’s a cleaning cycle? I’m excited because it actually made the coffee. It’s not as loud when brewing a pod but this caught me by surprise because it’s a brand new machine. Has anyone else experienced this?

*Reposted with video. The sound it makes during the cleaning cycle is much louder but it’s similar to what it sounds like at the end of the clip, just louder and more mechanical.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Preston North End vs. Blackburn Rovers: A Lancashire Labyrinth of Promotion and Peril**

The Championship’s most dramatic soap opera resumes as Preston North End, the “Lilywhites,” host Blackburn Rovers in a Lancashire derby that’s part football match, part survival thriller. Let’s parse the numbers, digest the drama, and serve up a prediction with a side of sarcasm.

---

### Parse the Odds: Math as a Bureaucratic Nuisance

The bookmakers have priced this like a high-stakes poker game. **Preston North End** is the favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **2.45–2.55** (implying a **39–41% implied probability** of victory). **Blackburn Rovers**, meanwhile, is a **2.75–3.05** shot (**32–36%**), while the draw sits at **3.0–3.2** (**31–33%**). Translating this into human terms: Preston is the “probably gonna happen” choice, Blackburn is the “prays to a higher power” underdog, and the draw is the “hope for a nap” middle ground.

The spread markets back this up, with Preston as even-money favorites (**-110**) and Blackburn a **+105** long shot. Meanwhile, the total goals line is locked at **2.25–2.5**, with “Under” priced cheaper than “Over.” Expect a match like a tense library quiet hour—no one wants to risk a loud goal and disturb the atmosphere.

### Digest the News: A Tale of Two Trajectories

**Preston North End** is football’s version of a well-polished escalator: moving upward, reliably, with minimal effort. Fourth in the Championship, they’ve gone four games without a loss, and their home form at Deepdale is as welcoming as a barista with free coffee. Their attack? A well-oiled espresso machine. Their defense? A vault guarded by a suspiciously well-dressed hedge fund manager.

**Blackburn Rovers**, though, is football’s answer to a reality TV contestant—charmingly desperate and one mishap from elimination. Sitting 19th, they’re six points from the drop zone, their three-game winning streak snapped by a Derby County team that probably still owes them money. Their recent 1-0 home loss to Derby reads like a cautionary tale: “Don’t trust a team that needs

1p33ovp,https://v.redd.it/goluz74g3n2g1,Café de Olla that Starbucks doesn't have.,"Café de olla is traditionally prepared in a clay pot, hence the name “café de olla.” But not everyone has one so use any pot you have in hand. Its origins go back to the Mexican Revolution, when the adelitas (women soldiers) kept this sweet, spiced coffee ready for fighters to stay awake, warm, and alert.

Ingredients:

4 cups water

4 tbsp ground coffee (dark roast preferred)

½ cinnamon stick

2–3 cloves

5 small piloncillos or 2–3 oz piloncillo (adjust to taste)

\---

Preparation:

1. In a pot, add water, piloncillo, cinnamon, and cloves.
2. Heat over medium-high until the piloncillo dissolves completely.
3. Once it reaches a gentle boil, add the ground coffee, stir, and cover.
4. Turn off the heat and let it steep for 5 minutes.
5. Strain into your favorite mug and enjoy the aroma. ☕🤎

Heads up: You may find a few coffee grounds at the bottom, totally normal and part of the experience.

She referred me to the hospital for an ultrasound of the arteries on my neck. The ultrasound found that a part of my carotid artery was elongated, and kinda looped back into another part of the artery, likely causing a turbulence. The doctor said it would not be a direct danger to my health and strongly recommended against surgery due to possible risks.

Aside from that I was also referred for a blood test because I already assumed that I was iron deficient. It turned out that I had very low ferritin levels so I was perscribed pills for iron deficiency. Likely the iron deficiency exacerbates my symptoms as it seems to get worse after donating blood. For many years my iron has likely been barely in the OK limit to be allowed to donate, and it recovers too slowly after. I will stop donating blood.

I had also known for years that skipping a cup of coffee would make the noise worse, now i'm trying to reduce my doses to find out if the problem actually comes from an over-reliance on coffee, instead of just a lack.

With coffee and iron levels that aren't in the gutter my PT is much more manageable, consider getting your iron checked if you are in doubt!",1,1763743698.0,PulsatileTinnitus,0,1.0,False

Went to sleep freezing and woke up having completely drenched my sweatshirt and sheets in sweat.  I somehow pulled myself out of bed, showered my disgusting sweaty greasy body, forced down a coffee, and went to class.  

I showed up 5 minutes late and felt like every eye was on me.  I've been absent for nearly a week, and I'm sure some of my classmates have noticed.  The professors certainly have.  Also I look like I've been through the wringer - puffy face, broken out, waxy complexion, watery bloodshot eyes.  I literally sat there in class, and felt beads of sweat trickle down the side of my face.

I scheduled an appointment with my doctor's office, who were miraculously able to squeeze me in last-minute.  I'm scared of that conversation, but I know I need to go because 1) I genuinely need to take this seriously get treatment, and 2) I need some kind of doctor's note or there is a very real chance that I'm not going to be able to pass some of my classes due to unexcused absences.

I haven't decided whether to come clean to them and let them know I relapsed.  They'll be disappointed.  Probably heartbroken.  I have no doubt my mother would cry.

I see how many issues people can face in a relationship and I even meet people who don't deserve a romantic partner at all, even myself at times. I just imagine the feeling of talking to someone thats close to me and I WANT them to hear it, wish I could hold someone close when I can't sleep at night. Im having a bad day, run out for some coffee or weed with them. I know part of it is sexual and I want sex yea, but I would love to receive affection in other ways than just sex. I enjoy experiencing things with others, especially when it's new to me. Learning with someone feels like a whole new level of interaction and connecting.

Dating apps are bogus. I don't get any matches and when I do I get a few texts and then they're gone. I've met women that are in relationships that STILL had their hinge profiles active just to go ""oh sorry forgot to delete this"" sure 🫩 not to complain about women's side of dating, a mf just cannot get these women to stay engaged in like 4 sentences. And the women that have scheduled dates with me have stood me up or just ghosted me, it's insane. 

Meeting women in person, I think I can do. Some women I've noticed just have an automatic rude disposition if a man even says ""hello"" to them. I understand the society we live in men can behave poorly and women have say generational trauma, I'm aware of how to be accountable and if someone is just giving me shit cause I got a penis, then oh well. I try to just not even notice their existence. 

Whenever I'm in person around people my energy internally almost goes to 0, I do not have it in me to even try talking to women in person unless I have some alcohol in my system or I already know the woman and were already aquatinted. I don't do terribly though, I can start a conversation and ask questions I just don't have my own answers half the time, I'm a dry book I can't deny. Sometimes I also just like to be away from all the people. No matter how much I wish I could be around people more I still end up realizing ""wow I don't want to be around people too long"". I want to socialize then I fucking don't, it's pissing me off trying to figure out what I want and it's a back and forth game with myself. ",2,1763743474.0,confessions,4,0.75,False

I noticed nothing wrong with it when i picked it up, but when I got home it had a definite musty smell to it, so strong that it stunk up the room that it was in and was unwearable. I looked up options for how to save it, and I tried putting it in a sealed bag with baking soda, then coffee grounds. For weeks. No dice. 
Then I tried to spray the lining (which I think is satin) with 70% alcohol, also did not work. At this point, I was trying not to touch the suede unless I had to because I was worried about discoloring it. The alcohol spray got onto one part of the coat a bit and revealed that the coat was already discolored a bit--in a spotted pattern. I tested another area--it has these weird spotted areas ALL OVER. I think that it probably got moldy in the past and was never properly cleaned off, hence the awful mildew/must smell. It seriously smells like a non climate controlled damp garage. 
[Here is an image of the spotting.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qPT6YFlwBpZANE8RqQZJ2F6E8LEG3tLn/view?usp=drivesdk)
I finally tried cleaning the entire suede area and lining of the coat with a dilute white vinegar solution. Also did not work. 
I don't have much money to put into this coat, and I am willing to try a few more DIY options to get the smell out and get it wearable! Is there anything I can do? Any specialized cleaners that are safe for suede? Should I just try and soak it in water? I am willing to risk the nap not being perfect to just get the smell out and at least be able to wear the dang thing.

Everything feels either unobtainable or soul sucking.,"I know I should consider myself lucky to have a job at all in this shit ass economy and the current job market. Blah blah blah. I don’t care. I hate working. I hate the work life “balance”. It’s destroying my sanity and sense of self. 

I’ve done everything “right”. I worked my ass off in high school. I worked 5-6 days a week (3-4 hours after school every day and all day Saturday), got straight A’s, was involved in clubs and was a student ambassador. I got into the honors program at a nice school, got a scholarship, etc. I worked 20-30 hours a week at various jobs, at a coffee shop, at a restaurant, and as a research assistant while taking 6 classes at a time in college. 

I sacrificed my social life, mental health, familial relationships, etc. because I thought hard work would pay off. I got hired straight out of college and landed a job in my desired field. I was excited and ambitious at first, but slowly the monotony and hopelessness crept in until I was a shell of myself. I should’ve been happy. I didn’t make much money but I worked a cushy desk job with good benefits and holidays off. But I would leave work and feel utterly drained, with zero energy for my spouse, my friends, my pets, my hobbies, or myself. I began wondering if I was depressed. 

Then I was laid off. I was given a very generous severance package, and after speaking with my husband, I decided to just take some time off from the job hunt and live my life as I felt so burnt out and hopeless. 

I was unemployed for four months. They were hands down the best four months of my life. I wasn’t depressed. I felt like a human being again. I exercised every single day. I cooked and ate well balanced, nourishing meals three times a day. I was getting a full 8 hours of sleep. My health improved drastically. I was able to maintain my home with ease. I made time for friends and date nights. I got back into all the hobbies I thought I had grown bored of but really just had no energy or mental space for. I started volunteering. I started making art. I was never bored. I was constantly doing something. I had been more involved in my community at this point in my life than I had ever been before. I was so happy. But I knew it couldn’t last. My partner and I never intended for either of us to be a house wife or house husband and we couldn’t afford it forever. 

So I began the long, agonizing process of job applications and interviews. It was miserable and borderline demeaning. I hated every minute of it. I would cry while looking at jobs because not a single one appealed to me. Each one just felt like I would be trading my soul away. I have never had a dream job aside from unemployed trust fund baby. 

I thought maybe I needed a change of scenery and pace. I didn’t want to be stuck behind a desk all day anymore. I ended up in a role that was adjacent to my previous ones but more social and people-facing, with lots of opportunity for me to walk around and do different things. I thought maybe a position where I was actively helping people and more active would help stave off the depression. 

The novelty of the new position was nice at first, but a few weeks in I was back to feeling just as hopeless and depressed as before. I frequently cry in my car before work because I just hate it so much. But I truly believe from the depths of my soul that I would feel like this about any job where I have to spend 40 hours a week for pennies while oligarchs shit in gold covered toilet seats on their yachts. 

I know life isn’t supposed to be like this. This isn’t healthy. I don’t mind working when I feel like I also have the ability to maintain the aspects of my life that give it meaning. But since I started back working I have barely seen my friends. I’m eating like shit. I don’t have time to cook or clean or exercise properly. I don’t get enough sleep. My social battery is drained. My pets miss me. I miss them. I’ve seen my family only twice in the past year. My quality of life is drastically reduced. 

During my time off I was “working” every day. I was volunteering at community gardens and childhood literacy programs. I was helping my elderly neighbors with stuff around the house. I was cooking meals and cleaning homes for pregnant loved ones. I was painting walls and building bookshelves. I wasn’t just sitting around on my ass watching tv. I was actually participating in life and the things that make it worth living. 

I fucking hate the current work culture and the bootlickers that try to make you feel like shit for being upset about it. I’m tired of people telling me I should be grateful just because some people have it worse. There is zero reason that 99% of humanity should be living like this. I could easily get all of my work done in 3 days if that was allowed. Even a 4 day work week would be a drastic quality of life improvement.

I’m just so tired. And I’m sad. And I needed to get this off my chest and whine for a minute.

You land on an online store selling handmade candles, scroll down to their return policy, and find detailed instructions about returning “damaged electronics” and policies on “restocking fees for apparel”

Wait, what?

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: Most e-commerce store owners are sabotaging their own sales with copy-pasted policies that have nothing to do with what they actually sell.

The Copy-Paste Problem:
Open up Shopify, WooCommerce, or any e-commerce platform, and you’ll find template policies. They’re convenient. They sound legal. So store owners grab them, maybe change the business name, and call it done.

The result? A skincare brand mentions “software licenses.” A digital product shop talks about “shipping damaged goods.” A dropshipping store references materials they’ve never heard of.
This isn’t just sloppy - it’s actively hurting your business.

Why Generic Policies Create Friction:
When potential customers read policies that don’t match your products, something clicks in their brain: This store doesn’t have their act together.
That tiny moment of confusion becomes doubt. Doubt becomes hesitation. Hesitation becomes an abandoned cart.

Generic policies signal:
- You don’t care about details
- You might not be a real business
- You probably copied everything else too
- They can’t trust what you say

What a Friendly, Conversion-Focused Policy Looks Like:
Here’s the difference: Instead of legal jargon designed to cover every possible scenario, write policies that actually help your customers feel confident buying from you.

Bad: “Items must be returned in original packaging with all materials, tags, and documentation within 30 days of receipt.”
Good: “Changed your mind about that lavender candle? No worries! Send it back within 30 days - even if you lit it once to test the scent. We just ask that there’s at least 90% left.”

See the difference? The second version is specific, friendly, and speaks directly to the actual product.

How to Write Policies That Build Trust: 
1. Only mention what you actually sell.
If you sell digital downloads, don’t talk about shipping. If you sell clothing, don’t mention software. This seems obvious, but check your policies right now- you might be surprised.

2. Use plain language.
You’re not writing a legal contract (and if you need legal protection, hire a lawyer. Templates won’t save you anyway). Write like you’re explaining your policy to a friend.

3. Lead with reassurance, not restrictions.
Start with what you WILL do for customers, not what you won’t. “We’ll happily exchange any size that doesn’t fit” beats “No refunds on sale items.”

4. Be specific to your products.
Selling coffee? Talk about freshness guarantees. Selling courses? Explain your 7-day money-back guarantee. Selling furniture? Address delivery damage clearly.

5. Anticipate real concerns.
What do YOUR customers actually worry about? If you sell electronics, they worry about defects. If you sell perishables, they worry about freshness. Address the real fears, not imaginary ones.

6. Make it scannable.
Use short paragraphs, bullet points when helpful, and clear headers. Nobody reads walls of text.

A Real Example:

Let’s say you sell organic dog treats. Here’s a policy that builds confidence:

Our Fresh Guarantee.
We bake your pup’s treats the same week we ship them. If anything arrives stale or broken, send us a photo and we’ll ship a fresh batch immediately - no need to return the original.

Not sure if Rex will like them?
Dogs can be picky! If your dog turns their nose up at our treats, let us know within 14 days and we’ll refund you in full. Just donate the treats to a local shelter and send us a quick note.

Allergic reaction or quality issue?
Your dog’s safety comes first. If you notice any adverse reaction or quality concern, stop feeding immediately and contact us. We’ll refund you and cover any vet visit directly related to our product.
See how that feels different? It’s specific, warm, and makes you trust the brand more.

The Bottom Line:
Your policies aren’t just legal protection - they’re part of your customer experience. They’re often the last thing someone reads before deciding to trust you with their money.

Take 30 minutes today. Read through your return policy, privacy policy, and terms. Delete everything that doesn’t apply to your actual business. Rewrite what’s left in a voice that sounds like YOU.

Your conversion rate will thank you.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

3. Dedicated Battery Pack for D7000

I like photography, definitely an amateur, and I'll keep my old camera that has a pretty good optical zoom as I like taking pictures of the moon. But for other photography, my camera isn't great. It would be nice to have something that is better quality for earthly photos lol. My point is I'm not expecting anything grand of this camera that is being offered, but just that it will be a good one (as the coffee grinder I'm considering for exchange is high quality itself)

I write this as a final message for anyone that stumbles upon the tip of the fuckin iceberg that is this.

What I’ve given you is merely step 1 of understanding what’s happening around you. The line of thought and questioning that will make you curious enough to look into this further, because it won’t take much.

These notes were just another mark on the trail.

I can tell you to stock up on foods and prepare for harsh times but the truth is there is nothing more powerful than knowledge and understanding.

Teach a man to fish and he will eat forever

When you look around, realize the people around you just want the same things. Peace, comfort, love. We are stronger and smarter together

The way I see it the government is nothing more than a toxic partner that uses manipulation to change your ideals. All it would take is complete separation from any attachment to the physical world. Your morning coffee, your weekly paycheck. Be in the world but not of it, this information shouldn’t envelop you but liberate you

You are still free, you are still okay!

**hdfidelity presents**  
  
---  

### **SERIES FINALE: The Road to Newark**

**Episode 10:** *“Showcase Showdown”*

---  

## **ACT I: “Where the Hell Did That Tank Come From?”**

**EXT. INTERSTATE 95 – DAWN**

The Delaware Turnpike was not designed for glory.

But on this morning, two tanks—one official and one unauthorized, duct-taped and divine—were converging on Newark, Delaware, from opposite ends of the horizon.

Lt. Rico and Sgt. Slick, after months of U-turns, diner detours, and pie judging, had finally recalibrated their nav system thanks to a goat who *headbutted it in just the right spot*.

Lt. Skidmark, Sgt. Rogers, and Pvt. Bunker, fresh off a harrowing escape from a subterranean militia-themed mini golf course, were riding high on adrenaline and exactly **3% battery life**.

---  

## **ACT II: THE LOW-PROFILE ENEMY: WILFRED CABLETON, LOBBYIST**

**INT. NEWARK CITY COUNCIL BUILDING – EARLY MORNING**

Wilfred Cableton—low-profile, high-functioning military lobbyist—adjusted his tie as he reviewed a quietly devastating budget memo. If the prototype showcase succeeded, funding for his **privately-backed drone swarm initiative** would be cut.

He sipped lukewarm coffee. Smiled coldly.

Outside the building: a **giant, inflatable blimp** reading “FUTURE OF COMBAT: ARRIVING TODAY.”

Cableton made one call:

> “Deploy the rail interceptors. And initiate narrative suppression protocols. Blame it on software.”

---  

**EXT. RAILWAY OVERPASS – SAME TIME**

Rico and Slick’s tank rumbled beneath the overpass when the train—unmarked, rapid, and suspiciously full of moving parts—cut across the road.

A high-pitched whine sounded. Two drone-pods deployed like bees from hell.

Slick slammed the yoke. Rico opened the side hatch and aimed the “Crowd Calmer” cannon. He fired a net—standard issue—and caught **one drone mid-hover**, which *electrocuted itself on impact* with the tank’s chassis.

The other one? **Flew straight into an overhead power line**. Exploded like a microwave full of fireworks.

Rico blinked.

“Did we just win by doing *nothing*?”

Slick: “We were *due*.”

---  

## **ACT III: THE HIGH-PROFILE ENEMY – THE GENERAL**

**INT. SHOWCASE FIELD – 10AM**

Major General Cuthbert was a career spectacle—a man of medals, menace, and a mustache shaped like a power structure. He stood before a waiting press line and unveiled… nothing.

No tank. No fanfare. Just a cheap banner that read **“INNOVATE TOMORROW”** and a complimentary granola bar station.

Corporal Radamés whispered: “Sir, we might have a problem.”

Cuthbert turned. “Define problem.”

Radamés pointed.

**Down the field… both tanks were arriving.**

---

**EXT. SHOWCASE FIELD – CONTINUOUS**

Rico’s tank rolled in slow, noble, and triumphant… until the brakes failed and it **gently nudged the press riser**, sending reporters tumbling like bowling pins.

Seconds later, Skidmark’s tank burst through the side gate, **covered in flags, parade streamers, and a single goat**. The turret slowly turned to face DuMont’s podium.

For a full ten seconds, there was only the sound of confused mooing.

Then the onboard speaker crackled:

> “*Showcase mode engaged.*”

Bunker had hit something again.

A *blaring, military-patriotic synth remix of “Take Me Home, Country Roads”* blasted through Newark.

---  

## **ACT IV: THE UNVEILING**

**INT. CONTROL TENT – LATER**

Brogan was sweating through his third shirt of the day. He watched the tanks parked side by side, one spotless and sterile, the other haphazard and glorious.

A Pentagon observer leaned in. “So which one was the official prototype?”

Brogan sipped bourbon from a flask disguised as a monocle case.

“…Define official.”

---  

**EXT. SHOWCASE FIELD – LATER**

In front of the tanks, Rico and Skidmark met for the first time.

Both men were silent.

Rico finally said, “You bought a goat.”

Skidmark nodded. “You hit a news van.”

They shook hands.

Behind them, Slick (A) and Slick (B) compared engine schematics while Bunker offered the goat a granola bar.

---

## **FINAL SCENE: DEPARTURE**

The showcase ended. Photos were taken. Brogan gave a speech that sounded like it was written by a confused AI and three underpaid interns.

Both tanks were loaded onto flatbeds. The crews stood nearby, uniforms wrinkled, expressions somewhere between triumph and disbelief.

Rico: “You think they’ll actually fund these things?”

Skidmark: “No. But I think they’ll fund the goat.”

Slick A: “Where are they sending us next?”

Slick B: “Hopefully not Maryland.”

Bunker: “I named him Clarence.”

Rico raised an eyebrow.

“The goat,” Bunker clarified.

They all nodded.

Fade to black.

I left the house at 8:03 a.m. for a school that starts at 8:00.
Classic Cyrick Plouffe move.
It’s minus twenty-five outside, the kind of cold that makes your lungs feel like broken glass, but I still stopped on the porch to find the perfect lo-fi track. Headphones on, hood up, world off. That’s the deal I make with myself every morning: give me music and I’ll survive another day.
By the time the bus actually shows up I’m stamped 9:47 a.m. on the attendance sheet in my head. Teachers don’t even mark me late anymore; they just look tired for me. Living an hour away is apparently a valid excuse when your grandma’s the one driving you insane about it.
I dig through my pockets for the envelope with the check I was supposed to mail last week. Gone. Probably still on the kitchen table under yesterday’s coffee mug. Big sister’s gonna kill me, then Grandma’s gonna resurrect me just to kill me again. Whatever. Next week.
The bus doors wheeze open. I step up, swipe my pass, and drop into the back seat like I always do. Earbuds in deeper. Volume louder. Same playlist on loop since 2022. If the battery dies before I get to school, the whole day is cursed. That’s not depression talking, that’s statistics.
I close my eyes and let the bass thump against the headache I forgot to take pills for.
For thirty seconds everything is quiet.
Then the bus brakes so hard my forehead smacks the window.
When I look up, the driver isn’t the usual old guy.
It’s me.
Except eight feet tall, barefoot in the snow, black robes flapping like wings, cracked skull mask hiding everything but a pair of glowing scarlet eyes.
He stares straight at me in the rear-view mirror.
“Get off the bus, Cyrick,” he says with my own voice, deeper, older, carved out of gravel and mountain wind. “You’re late for training.”
I blink.
The doors are already closing.
And the bus is gone.
I’m standing alone in the middle of a white nowhere, mountains taller than anything back home, wind screaming like it’s personally pissed at me.
The giant version of me is waiting ten feet away, arms crossed, snowflakes melting the second they touch his skin.
He doesn’t say it again.
He doesn’t have to.
I already know I’m not catching the 9:50 to school today.

Please excuse the way I’m writing, it may be all over the place but I’m just writing as it comes to me. Please feel free to give advice or thoughts. 

Im 28, and I am yearning for deep connections. I want nothing more than a best friend. I’ve never had one. I always seem to make friends with women who already have their group of best friends. I’m always the other friend.

I have one solid friend that I’ve had since high school. She has best friends of her own, but for me, she’s the closest thing I have to a best friend. I have acquaintances. But I am YEARNING for something deeper. I want a friend that I can FaceTime and talk about our days, life, anything. I don’t need a friend that has the exact same interests as me. (I like creative stuff like painting, pottery, reading, writing etc.) I’m open to people with all kinds of interests. I just want connection. 

I feel like I come off as awkward black girl. I live in a building with so many young professionals that are also young black and queer, but I don’t know how to even begin to connect with them. I hate that I feel like this alien weirdo that can’t make friends. 

I do have a lot of friendship trauma from my early and mid twenties, but my heart is still open to finding my people. But I’m starting to believe that maybe it isn’t meant for me to have close friendships. But the reality of that makes me so sad. I was just crying to my partner last night and telling her I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I can’t make new friends. My partner is the opposite, she makes a new friend everywhere she goes. She’s as they say the “golden retriever” type, and I’m more so the “black cat”. She says I don’t look approachable which is fair (I have a resting bitch face), but it’s not intentional, it’s just my face. I always speak, I always compliment black women everywhere I go. I just don’t know how to take it past  that point.

Every year when my birthday rolls around, when the holidays come, especially around Friendsgiving time, it just reminds me of how lonely I am.
I have cried myself to sleep about this countless nights. I’ve tried going to book clubs, game nights, coffee shops, etc. to meet new people but to no avail.

I don’t want to become bitter but being lonely like this is so depressing. 

I genuinely don’t know what to do. 

And I’m in Baltimore which is a city FULL of young black queer people, but idk I guess it isn’t meant for me. ",16,1763742577.0,blacklesbians,5,1.0,False

With medical problems, we need to be more prepared than the average joe. 

So here is a brief list of ideas to include. 

\-Portable battery packs are great, but they still need to be able to be charged if the disaster lasts long enough. Having a solar powered one, or one that can charge a phone off of conventional batteries is better. I have one that can charge a USB powered item from a 9v battery. I chose 9v because most stores don't sell out of them during storm related panic buying. Since it can power anything by USB, that means it can charge my pump, my flashlight, my AM/FM radio, and even a rechargeable cigarette lighter.

\-Food is obvious, we have a metabolic condition. I keep a propane camp stove, and many of my foods can be cooked or heated using only boiling water. Don't forget extra food for pets, and drink mixes for warm drinks (tea, instant coffee, cocoa, apple cider.)   
  
\-If your tap water is safe to drink, there are food grade bags you can buy for the bathtub. You fill it up and cap it off, then you have \~55 gallons of drinking water. If your tap requires filtration (I live in an area with unknown pipes, boiling doesn't get rid of lead) then it's best to keep at least one 5-gal jug per person for drinking and cooking, (though that often feels unreasonable in my house with no storage so we keep 1 and some life straws.)

\-Insulin can last a long time without power to the fridge, especially in the cold months. 100% of the time the bigger concern than being warm is being frozen. It's not going to get too warm just in the house. I've seen people keep food on their porch to keep it cold, don't do that with insulin. If you keep a jug of water in the freezer, you can move it into the fridge during an outage to keep the fridge cool longer. 

\-Contractor garbage bags or plastic drop cloths and duct tape. When you can't heat the full house, you're going to stay warmer by closing doors and blocking any unecessary hallways. It can also be used to insulate windows or cover door gaps.

\-Mylar blankets are never a bad thing. Small, cheap, and can do a lot to keep things warm and dry. I also keep the air activated hand warmers, they can go a long way in low heating to keep fingers nimble enough to administer medications or fill insulin pumps. 

\-Baby wipes are great when you can't shower but need to change infusion sites or CGMs. Cold baby wipes suck, warm them by placing them in a sealing bag, and place that in hot water for a few minutes.

Please don't hesitate to add more to this list. ",1,1763742386.0,diabetes,0,1.0,False

I'm seeking new friends in London or UK since i travel there fairly often. I will be near Canary Wharf for a short trip on the 24-30th Nov and it would be great to meet for a quick coffee. 

I'm normally described as introverted / shy so this  will be something out of my comfort zone but could also be an interesting experience with the right people and conversation.  

I'm passionate about tech, movies and geeky stuff. I also play football, table tennis and do go to the gym (but not as regularly as I want to). Other favorite topics of conversations are AI, finance, markets. 

Would also be down for cinema, board games, badminton and other activities later on if we click. ",2,1763742156.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False
