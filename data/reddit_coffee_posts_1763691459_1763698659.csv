( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

# Summary of The Duran: ""Corruption, Collapse and Zelensky's Europe Road Trip""

**Duration:** 25:03  
**Hosts:** Alex Christoforou and Alexander Mercouris  
**Release Date:** November 2025

---

## **Opening: Military Catastrophe Meets Political Theater (00:00 – 01:17)**

Alex Christoforou opens by establishing the stark contrast between Ukraine's battlefield collapse and Zelensky's diplomatic wanderings. Russian forces are ""advancing very quickly"" toward Zaporizhzhia, having completed the encirclement and capture of Pokrovsk—a town whose fall the hosts consider decisive despite official Ukrainian silence. Simultaneously, heavy fighting rages in Kupyansk, Kizlyar, and Lyman, creating what Christoforou calls a ""Ukrainian military collapse."" Into this dire strategic crisis, Zelensky has chosen to embark on what Western media euphemistically term a ""European road trip,"" visiting Greece and France to ""ask for money and weapons and signing gas deals."" The framing immediately establishes the core theme: catastrophic failure on the ground meets delusional political performance in European capitals.

## **The Battlefield Reality: An ""All-Encompassing Military Crisis"" (01:32 – 09:18)**

Alexander Mercouris delivers a devastating assessment, arguing the West still hasn't grasped that Ukraine faces ""something worse than setbacks."" Examining Ukrainian military bloggers and reporters, he sees ""panic and rage"" directed at Zelensky, Zaluzhny, and the military command. The Pokrovsk cauldron represents a strategic disaster. While Russia hasn't officially declared the town captured, Mercouris explains this is standard procedure—they wait until the entire cauldron, including the Mirnograd grouping, is cleared. At least half the cauldron has already fallen, with Ukrainian claims of ""gray zone"" control essentially admitting Russian dominance. Several hundred to several thousand Ukrainian troops are now surrounded.

The strategic implications are seismic: Pokrovsk's fall opens Russia's path west toward the Dnieper and the key logistics hub of Pavlograd, while enabling Russia to outflank and eventually encircle the fortified Donbass cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. Kupyansk, Mercouris continues, has essentially fallen—Russia controls the industrial sector east of the Oskil River and the higher-ground residential areas west of it, with only southern parkland suburbs still contested. Ukrainian forces trapped east of Kupyansk face imminent surrender.

But these disasters are ""overshadowed by an even greater disaster unfolding in the south."" In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces are close to encircling Gulyaipole and have captured Malaya Tokmachka—the very village Ukraine used as its base for the failed 2023 summer offensive toward the Sea of Azov. With Tokmachka lost and Gulyaipole about to be surrounded, Orekhovo cannot hold, bringing Russia to the gates of Zaporizhzhia city itself and the Dnieper River. Further north, Novopavlivka—expected to hold for weeks or months—collapsed almost immediately. Meanwhile, the battle for Volchansk in the Kharkov region is concluding, giving Russia control of the high ground around Kharkiv city. Mercouris synthesizes this into a chilling conclusion: ""in a few weeks or months, the Kharkov region in the north is going to be as critical as the situation in Zaporizhzhia.""

The Ukrainian army is ""desperately short of men,"" its drones are ""outmatched by Russian drones,"" and the Russian air force is bombing ""round the clock,"" producing **120,000 FAB bombs per day**. The situation ""bears all the hallmarks of an early collapse.""

## **Zelensky's Road Trip: Escapism from Multiple Crises (09:18 – 11:57)**

Christoforou asks what Zelensky's European tour signifies. Mercouris replies it's what Zelensky ""always does when things start to go wrong."" He faces a ""political crisis in Kiev"" (the corruption scandal), a catastrophic budget situation where Ukraine ""spending double what it earns from domestic taxation,"" and European paralysis over seizing Russian assets, with Euroclear threatening legal action against such schemes. Rather than confront these crises, Zelensky ""flees Kiev""—""that's really the man's thing, he runs away.""

The hosts mock Zelensky's meetings with Mitsotakis in Greece (who promised US LNG routes to Ukraine, a meaningless gesture) and Macron in France (some ""grand strategic partnership""). Mercouris predicts visits to Brussels to see ""dear friend Karm"" (von der Leyen) and eventually Germany to see ""other dear friend Friedri Mounts"" (Merz). Among these ""friends,"" Zelensky ""feels safe"" and ""comfortable,"" collecting ""promises"" far preferable to facing ""crisis in Kiev and collapse on the battle fronts and an economy plunging toward collapse.""

## **The Corruption Scandal: Officials Fleeing the Sinking Ship (11:57 – 14:56)**

Christoforou reveals that Zelensky's ""entertainment buddy"" Minderich (Myndych) ""has fled to Israel,"" while Rustem Umerov, the former defense minister now head of the National Assembly Security Council, went to Turkey, then Qatar, and hasn't returned in five or six days—""it looks like he's bolted."" This exodus of top officials amid scandal suggests panic at the highest levels.

The hosts probe what the West still wants from Zelensky. Mercouris says ""to continue to fight the conflict,"" but notes weapons supplies are ""dwindling—not because they don't want to give him weapons, they can't."" This leads to the Norwegian wealth fund proposal: Norway might give its **$140 billion sovereign wealth fund** to Ukraine. Mercouris sees this as desperate ""cannibalizing,"" noting Støre (whom he mistakenly calls ""Stoltenberg,"" conflating him with the NATO chief) being ""very keen"" because ""all the European leaders want to do is go on writing checks for Zelensky,"" even if it means ""France and Britain intensify their budget crisis"" and ""Germany runs up more debt.""

The hosts frame this as ""throwing good money after bad"" that ""doesn't resolve the underlying problem."" Christoforou suggests the money might just enable Zelensky to ""close all the various positions in Kiev, pay off all those people who still want their cut, pile up the money in suitcases, and go""—the final looting before escape.

## **Umerov's Mysterious Travels: Banking Business in the Gulf (15:10 – 17:02)**

Mercouris analyzes Umerov's official excuse for his Turkey-Qatar trip: restarting Russian prisoner exchange negotiations, despite Ukraine's deputy foreign minister recently stating talks were suspended until year's end. The real motive is transparent—""you get him out of Kiev to prevent him answering questions."" When Turkey negotiations prove ""sticky"" (likely because Russia is making demands), Umerov jets to Qatar and the UAE. Mercouris speculates bluntly: ""places where there are all kinds of banks and financial institutions located... Perhaps that's more important... to straighten out things there before the music stops.""

## **The Corruption Fallout: European Self-Sabotage (17:02 – 18:00)**

Christoforou marvels that European leaders keep ""funneling money to Zelensky even after this corruption scandal,"" which included ""gold toilet and bags of cash"" detailed in the *Financial Times*. While ""100 million to Zelensky is a cup of coffee"" in the grand scheme, the scandal ""has done a lot of damage"" to public perception, making it harder for European leaders to justify funding. Yet as Donald Tusk acknowledged, ""they still are trying to do it."" The hosts call this ""incredible""—a disconnect between public sentiment and elite commitment.

## **US Escalation: The Russia/Iran Embargo Plan (18:00 – 20:25)**

The conversation shifts to Trump's surprising alignment with Zelensky. Christoforou notes Trump announced Congress is crafting legislation that ""will punish any country that does business with Russia and Iran""—effectively an embargo. Trump was ""very proud"" to have personally suggested adding Iran. Mercouris immediately identifies this as ""Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal all over again,"" reviving dead-on-arrival proposals.

## **Trump's Delusion and European Cannibalism (20:25 – 22:45)**

Christoforou observes articles claiming US inflation stems from ""Russia and strikes on Russian energy,"" concluding ""Trump has not gotten the memo that Ukraine is going to lose."" Despite this, ""it's more escalation for him."" Mercouris agrees Trump ""set himself on this course,"" while Europeans are ""busy writing up the checks."" He predicts US funding will resume ""sooner or later,"" calling the entire dynamic ""extraordinary,"" ""baffling,"" possessing an ""obsessive quality.""

Christoforou asks what a US embargo would mean. Mercouris explains it would simply drive countries to ""stop openly trading with the United States"" and find ""workarounds,"" because Russia is ""indispensable""—providing oil, grain, and integrated into world supply chains. ""Trying to blockade Russia is a fool's idea. It cannot work."" China will never comply, and as the *Financial Times* notes, China already has ""decisive leverage"" through chip and rare earth shortages devastating Western car industries.

## **Russian Diplomatic Strategy: Exposing Trump's Capitulation (22:45 – 25:03)**

The hosts examine Moscow's diplomatic posture. Christoforou notes Russian officials say ""Trump is someone we can work with because he understands the root causes""—a statement both hosts find baffling given Trump's embargo advocacy. Mercouris calls it ""a bad look"" but senses a ""ritual quality"" to these comments, suggesting ""all conviction has been draining away.""

Lavrov has been giving interviews ""steadily destroying Trump's position,"" providing detailed accounts of Trump's supposed promises during their call: that Trump would pressure Zelensky to accept ""Istanbul plus"" terms including Donbass withdrawal. When Trump instead ""caved to what Zelinsky wanted,"" he exposed his own ""capitulation."" Now Russia says it's prepared to meet Trump but only ""on the basis of what we agreed with him in Anchorage""—a public framing that makes any future deal appear as Russian victory and Trump surrender. Mercouris concludes this ""full account"" from Lavrov means ""what could have been a deal... will come to be seen by most people as a capitulation.""

## **Conclusion: The Obsessive Death Spiral (24:40 – 25:03)**

Christoforou reiterates the central paradox: ""They all see that they're going to lose, but they just can't stop,"" including Trump. The West's ""obsessive quality"" drives them to ""cannibalizing everything they have left just to keep this thing operating"" even as Ukraine's military position becomes ""intractable"" and ""impossible"" to resolve. The video ends with the hosts promoting their Substack, Rumble, Telegram, and X accounts, leaving viewers with the impression of a geopolitical death spiral driven by elite psychological pathologies rather than rational strategy.

---

## **Core Arguments:**

1. **Military Collapse is Irreversible**: Multiple cauldrons (Pokrovsk, Kupyansk, Zaporizhzhia) are sealing, with Russian forces achieving strategic breakthroughs on all fronts simultaneously.

2. **Zelensky's Road Trip is Escapism**: Facing military disaster, budget collapse, and corruption scandal, Zelensky flees to European capitals for symbolic support rather than confronting reality.

3. **Official Exodus Signals Imminent Collapse**: Top officials like Myndych and Umerov have fled to Israel and the Gulf, suggesting they're securing personal finances before the ""music stops.""

4. **Western Funding is Desperate Cannibalization**: From Norway's sovereign wealth fund to potential US re-engagement, the West is destroying its own financial stability to prop up an unwinnable war.

5. **US Embargo Would Backfire**: Trump's Russia/Iran embargo legislation would only isolate the US economically while failing to damage Russia's self-sufficient, China-backed economy.

6. **Russian Diplomacy is Framing Trump as Capitulator**: Lavrov's detailed disclosures about Trump's broken promises are positioning any future deal as Russian victory and American surrender.

7. **Psychological Obsession Drives Policy**: European and American leaders ""see they're going to lose but just can't stop,"" sacrificing their own economies and political capital in what amounts to ritualistic self-destruction.",1,1763698292.0,WayOfTheBern,1,1.0,False

\[CHAPTER 3 PLAN + SETSUKA’S CLASS TRIAL\]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRUBp\_QMGGk&t=2929s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRUBp_QMGGk&t=2929s)

She planned a double culprit murder of Setsuka Chiebukuro at the pool, using misdirected entries and exits, and concealed the entire crime to make it appear as if a single culprit had committed it in the ghost house, all thought of in under eight hours.

She first wanted to remove Iroha Nijue’s potential alibi to make everyone believe she could have been the culprit. She did this by analyzing Iroha’s schedule in advance and exploiting it to her advantage, lacing her Coffee with sleeping pills from the infirmary so that once Iroha returned to her room, she would sleep all day.

After this, she began her main plan. She first entered the pool using Hibiki’s handbook and lured Setsuka Chiebukuro there using Hibiki’s handbook. She then electrocuted Setsuka, with a taser knocking her out, and poured blood on her using blood bags she had taken in advance from the infirmary to make it appear as though Setsuka was dead. Next, she had Hibiki enter the pool area using Setsuka’s handbook, making it look like Setsuka had exited alive.

Hibiki fell into a trance, and she took advantage of this to perform a synchronized double stabbing of Setsuka’s abdomen with Hibiki. Her strategy was that if they both stabbed at the same time, they would both be considered the killers, making the class trial easier for her to win. She would only need to convince everyone that there was a single killer; no matter who they voted for, she would win. She had, of course, anticipated who to involve by testing Hibiki’s synchronicity with her in advance, discovering an error margin of only 0.000001 seconds. She knew Hibiki would be perfect for the double-culprit strategy and she brought a first aid kit she had taken in advance from the infirmary just in case they were out of sync. Her next step came after realizing that the parade on the island took place at approximately 6:00 PM, allowing her to create an alibi. She retrieved her own handbook through Hibiki and exited through it, which was marked as an entry since it was her first time using her handbook. 

She then set up a pool maintenance sign to prevent everyone else from entering the crime scene and left to collect dismemberment tools and returned, marking her entry as an exit. She dismembered Setsuka’s hands, placed them in a bag and gave them to Hibiki as padding by pinning it to her chest, and switched hair clips with her, sending Hibiki to the parade as herself, thereby giving herself an alibi in advance. Additionally, she tricked the others into believing that Setsuka was alive and still planning to attend the parade, though she would be arriving late, using Setsuka’s handbook. Also removing the pool maintenance sign.

This entire setup took place between 8:30 AM and 12:00 PM, completely concealing the actual time of the murder. She dismembered the body into ten parts, placing them into seven different bags and thoroughly cleaning the scene. She then transported the seven bags onto a monorail after leaving the pool through Setsuka’s handbook, which was marked as an entry, and hid the remaining two parts inside an animatronic at the storage facility.

She returned, re-entering through Hibiki’s handbook, which was marked as an exit, and then left again using Setsuka’s handbook, which was marked as an entry. She handed Hibiki Setsuka’s handbook, effectively removing herself from suspicion, and began transporting the body from the pool to the haunted castle.

That prior Coffee plan, however, failed because Iroha didn’t drink the Coffee that day, so she quickly improvised another ploy. Using Setsuka’s handbook, she texted Iroha while posing as Setsuka, arranging to meet at exactly 6:00 PM in the Mirror Mansion. This ensured that Iroha would be stuck there due to the parade’s numerous animatronics blocking her path, once again removing her possible alibi.

After that She quickly moved on to the next phase. Using the monorail that operated between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM, traveling in both directions with a five-minute stop at each station, she used her above average accuracy to throw the body bags into the ghost house chimney as the monorail passed overhead. Since she could only throw one bag per pass, she calculated, based on the monorail’s speed and stops, that she would have seven opportunities before 6:00 PM. That’s why she cut the body into precisely sized parts in advance to ensure they could fit through the chimney. By 6:00 PM, she had successfully gotten all the bags into the chimney.

She now had to conceal the timing of the Ghost House. She did this by assigning Hibiki to enter the castle shortly before 6:00 PM using her handbook, then had her leave using Kanade’s own handbook. This created a record showing that two different people had entered. She then tricked Iroha into coming to the haunted castle by posing as Setsuka once more through Setsuka’s handbook. She planned this so that Iroha would see Hibiki entering, linking the crime scene to a potential killer and witness. Finally, she retrieved Hibiki’s handbook and entered through it, marking her entry as her exit. In this way, she used her sister as a scapegoat while framing Iroha as a witness.

Upon entering the Ghost House, She cut the fuse box wires and killed the fire in the fireplace creating a blackout from within to clear the chimney passageway and make others not notice the discrepancies inside until the designated time she had planned she then retrieved the two parts inside the animatronic under the guise of searching for Setsuka with the others and entered the ghost house through Setsuka’s Handbook making it seem as though she entered and was killed retrieved the body parts from the chimney and hid them behind the curtains. She then used blood packets to create a trail leading to the Devil’s Room, making it appear as though Setsuka’s dismembered body had been dragged there placed the parts in the Ghost House, arranging each on a separate altar, reinforcing the illusion that the murder had taken place there and used blood packets to create a trail leading to the Devil’s Room, making it appear as though Setsuka’s dismembered body had been dragged there.

And finally, she not only framed her sister as the culprit but also removed yet another potential alibi. First, she left her sister’s hairpins in the Devil’s Room to increase suspicion when the evidence was found. Then, she priorly convinced Iroha that she would personally investigate a completely remote location while she herself went to investigate near the crime scene, closer to the pool. This way, if suspicion arose, she could claim she was far from the crime scene, while Iroha appeared to be alone near the actual crime scene—making it look as though Iroha was attempting to erase evidence.

During the Class trial she used all the fake evidence she had planted on her sister to frame her as the sole murderer. This included Hibiki’s hairpin being found in the Devil’s Room, the fact that Hibiki couldn’t remember anything, Hibiki having her hair down during the investigation, no one having seen Hibiki all day except Iroha, who saw her enter the Ghost House, before the body was found in there and the fact that Setsuka was placed on the altar, indicating she was precious to the culprit—a trait Hibiki did consider true. She manipulated everyone into believing Hibiki was the murderer, except Syobai, who tried to argue that Kanade was framing Hibiki due to Setsuka’s missing abdominal area, but Kanade shut him down with refutations.

She also used all the fake evidence she had planted on Iroha to accuse her of being the sole murderer. She pointed out Iroha’s lack of an alibi, that no one had seen her that day, that she had been at the crime scene before the investigation began, and that she was left-handed—matching Syobai’s theory that the culprit was left-handed. She manipulated everyone, including Syobai, into believing Iroha was the murderer, except for Mikado, who revealed that Iroha had been painting at the time of the murder. Syobai again tried to accuse Kanade after hearing Teruya’s and Sora’s accounts, but Kanade shut him down again by pointing out the flaws in his theory, forcing Syobai back into silence.

After Hibiki confirmed that Kanade had another ultimate talent, which would explain the body part overhead monorail tosses and her match against Hibiki in darts where she hit every target with perfect precision getting a perfect score and according to Hibiki she’s always gotten a perfect score in darts everyone was able to back her into a corner—but this was exactly what she wanted. If they only voted for her, they would all die, and she would win. She deliberately acted irritated and scared, pretending to be on the verge of exposure and even confessing, convincing them that she was the sole murderer.

At the end of the Class Trial before her and Hibiki’s execution she deliberately revealed Setsuka’s will and piqued everyone’s curiosity about the will without revealing its contents, then burned it with a lighter to sow psychological turmoil.

\[PAST HISTORY + OTHER CLASS TRIALS\]

She would repeatedly murder Hibiki’s acquaintances to psychologically break her reducing her to the state of an obedient puppet starting with Hibiki’s dog Shiro she took a kitchen knife, butchered Shiro into pieces, and washed him down the drain to dispose of the evidence pushing Hibiki’s best friend Ayumi down a flight of stairs to cause her entire body to be paralysed for the rest of her life giving the middle-school teacher Hibiki had a crush on an extra dose of muscle relaxant, and burying him outside the school to dispose of the evidence killing the recording engineer, makeup coordinator, and manager for Hibiki’s band turning them into sushi to dispose of the evidence and murdering her own parents.

Despite being interrogated by Tsurugi Kinjo, the Ultimate Police Officer for these murders she managed to stay composed and act innocent convincing him that she wasn’t involved.

At the age of 3–4, she realized she was superior to Hibiki in everything and that was why Hibiki would pick on her.

During Yuri’s Class Trial, it’s revealed that she went to the infirmary after realising Yuri Kagarin died from an anesthetic substance, because she had smelled it many times before and discovered that a single syringe had disappeared. She reasons that the missing syringe could be used to conveniently calculate the sedation time using the scale on the bottle. She correctly theorises that the culprit began preparations at night, exploiting a loophole. She realises that the culprit didn’t pull Yuri up directly, but instead used a hook attached to his life jacket, which was connected to him with a rope, utilizing the bell tower to pull them up. She reasons that the culprit couldn’t have jumped off the bell tower due to its height, as the kinetic energy from the distance fallen would have dislocated their shoulders upon landing. She also concludes that Yuri was nearly unconscious because he accepted help from the culprit. She pieces together the timeline of events: Yuri’s death occurred before the body discovery announcement, giving the culprit extra time to move around while Sora and Yuki were climbing the stairs. She further reasons that the culprit used the hook to descend instead of the stairs, eliminating the possibility that he wouldn’t have had enough time to commit the crime. She infers that he yanked the hook out of Yuri’s right calf while carrying Yoruko to the top, then reinserted it afterward. She concludes that the broken wires were set up as an alibi and that the culprit jumped off the bell tower twice. Finally, she correctly hypothesises that the culprit used Yuri’s Handbook to prompt anyone who witnessed the murder scene to run up the bell tower to catch the culprit. Ultimately, she reasons that the culprit was forced to jump off the bell tower due to outside interference.

While investigating Kokoro’s murder scene, she noticed fallen icicles with carved inscriptions. Using this, she was able to identify the killer before the trial. During the class trial, she revealed that Kokoro had actually frozen to death in the fridge and deciphered that Kokoro’s dying message formed a pattern representing each icicle as a girl, with the pierced icicle symbolizing Kokoro. Since the pierced icicle was the largest, she concluded that the culprit was the tallest girl, Emma Magorobi. She also refuted all of Emma’s counterarguments to the accusation. She was also able to reason Emma’s entire motive for killing Kokoro, as well as Kokoro’s prior mental state and actions, based on Emma’s reactions and behavioral traits. She was also able to see through Emma’s fake acting.

\[OTHER\]

After watching Monocrow’s video of her killing her parents, she realised she was in a virtual world. The video was real, yet she had no memory of it. From that clue — along with the fact that Hajime Makunouchi survived falls from the bell tower that would realistically dislocate his shoulder even with rope assistance due to the kinetic energy involved — she came to this conclusion atleast this is how I interpret it. This feat showcases \[LGT (Logical Thinking) PER (Perceptional Reasoning) PR (Pattern Recognition) LT (Linear Thinking) and LR (Logical Reasoning)\].

I am not a redditor, however, finding this page has honestly been a godsend because I was very recently discarded by a dismissive avoidant and was so hurt and confused! We were together for only 3 months, however, the complete 180 left me reeling. I've been no contact since day 1 and healing. I was reading through my journal and found an older entry I feel may resonate with folks here. I wanted to share to hopefully help you feel less alone, and recognize that you deserve better!

""He broke up with me...completely out of the blue. It's been a complete and total mindfuck. I was really excited about him, I was invested in us. We talked everyday...often the first person I would text in the morning and the last person I would text at night. I never felt his affection for me was false. He brought me to all these events, I met his friends and they were all so lovely. His cozy apartment, with the soft couch I'll never sit on again. The final coffee he made me, the last time he hugged me, the last time I walked through his door and took the elevator down, completely alone. This overwhelming feeling that he threw away a good thing because he was scared. The way a partner can make you feel so special and then tear out your heart and make you feel ordinary. Days prior telling me how excited he was to see me, weeks prior saying he liked me so much, and ultimately making me feel like my search for companionship was over. No more movie nights, cuddles, shared meals. But, as I reflect, I can now see how he did it. The man I liked was not the whole picture. Turns out, he is flawed. He does not even possess the qualities I most admire in others: openness, vulnerability, empathy and kindness. He could be a sourpuss and would say completely incorrect things..making me question his intellect and maturity. He was also very rigid, another unattractive quality. But, he did make me feel seen, attractive, and wanted...and it is okay that I miss those experiences. It's hard to think that he could do this to me. He seemed safe, unassuming, and we were matched on major interests and goals. Anytime I hear a car pull up, see a figure walk by or a message pop up on my phone...my heart leaps with hope. And it's never him. And that hurts now but with time he will not be my focus but simply a lesson. 

Bottom line, why would I be with someone who cannot and will not fulfill my innermost desire of true, authentic connection? Having someone sit on the couch with me as we discuss the weather is not enough""",1,1763698029.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

We’ve been operating on **Doña Teodora Street (also known as Twin Road)** since March 2025. We have all the proper documentation, including a **DTI business registration** and a **barangay special permit** that explicitly allows us to operate at this location.

Last night, some barangay officials came to our site and told us that we were **not allowed to operate here**. We were shocked, as our permit clearly lists this street as an approved location. We calmly explained the situation and showed them our special permit, emphasizing that our setup is **on an empty public lawn**, not obstructing the road or sidewalks.

The officials told us that they were **acting on orders from a higher barangay authority**, instructing street vendors to relocate, and asked us to **bring our documents today** for verification.

We understand and respect the barangay’s role in regulating businesses, and we want to fully comply with any legitimate rules. However, given that we have a **valid permit**, we are seeking clarification and guidance to ensure we can continue operating our pop-up coffee shop **legally, peacefully, and in accordance with barangay regulations**.

After that I was advised by a medical professional to skip a day to help balance out the levels and it has been hell ever since last Wednesday no matter what I do. 

Timeline:
	•	last Wednesday: accidentally double dose. Also had a coffee before I realized I double dosed-I sometimes drink coffee with 1 Wellbutrin and normally feel great. I had Sever motor twitches. Dry mouth. Uncontrollable shaking during my midterm test and hours later. 
	•	Thu: I continued with my normal dose thinking this was the best course of action. I was shaking in the late afternoon and into the evening
	•	Fri: skipped and felt very uncomfortable. Brain zaps
	•	Sat: took a dose. The motor tremors started later that night
	•	Sun: skipped
	•	Mon: took a dose and was shaking for hours but only at night like 1 am-4 am
	•	Tue: skipped and had the shakes so badly 
	•	Wed (yesterday): took a dose → HOURS of intense tremors/motor twitching
	•	Thu (today): took a dose but started a new bottle in case something was wrong with the current bottle. still twitchy + anxious + dry mouth + off balance feeling and can’t sleep because of these tremors

It’s been 8 days since the double dose and I still feel like my nervous system is overloaded. Has this happened to anyone else? Do I taper off or continue as normal and hope it comes to an end?


Also I haven’t had any caffeine or alcohol since i took the double dose but I’m hosting a party this weekend and would like to drink potentially but very afraid. ",1,1763697487.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,0,1.0,False
1p2oonz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2oonz,NKD - Toyama & Matsubara,"Well, I’ve had both of these for a little while but am only now posting them.

I generally tend to buy knives, try them, and sell them if they’re not to my liking. In my hunt I found these two which I won’t let go of.

The first is a Matsubara tall Nakiri. When I first got it I wasn’t a huge fan. The grind was slightly too thick bte for me. But now that I’ve thinned it a little, put a new handle on (Vietnamese rosewood), and etched it in coffee and apple cider vinegar, it’s found a place in my heart. Absolute cracker of a knife that falls through most produce effortlessly since being thinned out.

The second one is my Toyama. Bought off another member on the bst and so glad for it. Its handle is the brother of the Matsubara one, in that they’re cut from the exact same block of wood. The Toyama is a beast, it has nice food release but my god the best thing is the steel. It sharpens up so easily, and holds an insane edge for a long time. The old master surely knows his craft, and I hope all sharpeners get to try his steel one day.

# Safely Shipping Ceramics from China

Be aware, almost all these items are heavy/bulky items. For example, its probably around the size/weight of tall boots with box/papers, which I shipped in a box by itself and that was $46. You could prob ship 3-4 of them depending which, for around 140-150. 

This isn't like a bag/boots where it can be used to add more items inside either. And you're not shipping a container load of items.

These items lets say you got 1 it will be in roughly a 20x15x10 box. 

These ceramic/stoneware/glassware reps come in stiff gift boxes designed to completely pad the item and of course, this is ok to protect it inside China. 

It would be essential to have any sort of fragile items you purchase taped with some large bubble wrap a couple times on the outside. Another helpful tip is to include padding that moves around inside the bigger box such as filler or peanuts. This will make your item max protected.

This is also going to help keep the box/gift bag nice, because hey why not keep them good. It will probably cost about $5 US to get it as padded as it should be. Trust me just do it! Things move around on their way here a lot!!",1,1763697405.0,RepLadiesDirect,0,1.0,False

1p2on87,https://i.redd.it/0aahzknk9j2g1.jpeg,My Ex-Husband’s Nightmare novel. Help me find it,"
The anniversary dinner had been perfect—or so I'd thought. Cooper had chosen my favorite restaurant, ordered the wine I loved, and even remembered to compliment the dress I'd spent weeks picking out. We'd laughed over shared memories, his hand covering mine across the candlelit table, and for a moment, everything felt like it used to when we were eighteen and invincible. Now, standing in our kitchen with my phone in my trembling hands, that perfect evening felt like a cruel joke. ""Just share the photos,"" I whispered to myself, trying to steady my breathing. ""Simple. Normal. What married couples do."" I opened AirDrop, expecting to see ""Cooper's iPhone"" appear in the list of nearby devices like it had countless times before. Instead, a name I'd never seen stared back at me: ""Sunshine."" My wedding ring caught the morning light as I twisted it around my finger—once, twice, three times. The familiar weight of it suddenly felt foreign, like it belonged to someone else's life. ""Sunshine?"" The word tasted bitter on my tongue. Cooper had never called me that. In all our years together—through high school sweethearts, college long-distance, the early struggles of his business, even through the devastating loss of our baby—he'd never once used that pet name. I was always ""Luna,"" sometimes ""sweetheart"" when he was feeling particularly tender, but never ""Sunshine."" I stared at the screen until my eyes burned, willing the name to change back, to reveal itself as some technical glitch or my own tired imagination. But it remained stubbornly, mockingly present: ""Sunshine."" The photos from last night—our smiling faces, his arm around my waist, the anniversary cake we'd shared—suddenly felt like evidence of a lie I'd been living without knowing it. My hands shook as I navigated to Cooper's social media accounts, something I'd never felt the need to do before. Why would I? I trusted him completely. We shared everything, didn't we? Apparently not everything. The friend request notification sat at the top of my own social media feed like a poison dart aimed directly at my heart. Someone named ""Moonlight"" wanted to connect with me. The profile picture showed only a silhouette—a woman's figure against a sunset, deliberately mysterious, calculatedly alluring. Moonlight and Sunshine. The cosmic poetry of it made me sick. I clicked on the profile with fingers that no longer felt like my own. The account was sparse, clearly new, but what little was there told a story I didn't want to understand. Photos of expensive restaurants I'd never been to. Wine glasses raised in toasts I wasn't part of. A delicate hand—not mine—wearing jewelry that looked far too expensive for someone who kept their identity hidden. And then I saw it: a photo of Cooper's watch. The vintage Rolex I'd saved for months to buy him for his thirtieth birthday. It was lying on what was clearly a hotel nightstand, next to a woman's earrings I'd never seen before. The kitchen tilted around me. I gripped the marble countertop, the same countertop where Cooper had kissed me just this morning before leaving for work, where he'd promised to bring home my favorite takeout for dinner. ""Mrs. Watkins?"" I spun around, my phone clattering to the floor. A woman stood in my doorway—my doorway, in my home—as if she had every right to be there. She was young, maybe mid-twenties, with dark hair that caught the light the same way mine used to before stress started threading it with premature silver. She was beautiful in a way that felt like looking into a funhouse mirror of my younger self. ""How did you—"" I started, but she cut me off with a smile that was all sharp edges. ""The gate was open. Your housekeeper let me in."" She stepped into my kitchen with the confidence of someone who belonged there, her heels clicking against the tiles I'd spent hours choosing when we renovated. ""I'm Veronica Torres. I think it's time we talked."" She moved closer, and I caught her perfume—something expensive and cloying that made my stomach turn. ""You see, Mrs. Watkins, there's been a misunderstanding. Cooper and I are together now, and frankly, this whole charade has gone on long enough."" The words hit me like physical blows, but I forced myself to remain standing, to keep my voice steady. ""I'm sorry, who are you exactly?"" Veronica's laugh was like breaking glass. ""I'm the woman your husband loves. The woman he calls 'Sunshine.' And you, darling,"" she gestured around my kitchen, my home, my life, ""you're in my way."" She reached into her purse and pulled out a business card, placing it on my counter with deliberate precision. ""My lawyer's information. I suggest you call him soon. Cooper wants a divorce, and honestly, it would be so much easier if you just... stepped aside gracefully."" The audacity of it stole my breath. This stranger, this interloper, standing in my kitchen, demanding I give up my marriage, my life, my identity as if it were a coat she could simply try on. ""Get out."" The words came from somewhere deep inside me, somewhere I'd forgotten existed. Veronica tilted her head, studying me like I was an interesting specimen. ""I know this is hard to accept, but Cooper doesn't love you anymore. He hasn't for a long time. Why do you think he turned to me?"" She moved toward the door, then paused, looking back with mock sympathy. ""Oh, and Luna? You should probably change your AirDrop name too. 'Moonlight' has such a nice ring to it, don't you think?""

Chapter 2

I chose Café Lumière for our confrontation—neutral ground with witnesses, the kind of upscale downtown spot where scenes were discouraged by white tablecloths and hundred-dollar lunch tabs. If Veronica wanted to play games in my home, she could face me on equal footing here. She arrived fifteen minutes late, of course. I watched her through the floor-to-ceiling windows as she stepped out of a black sedan that was definitely not hers—too expensive, too new. She moved with the calculated grace of someone who knew she was being watched, her red dress hugging curves that were meant to remind me of what I'd lost. ""Luna."" She slid into the chair across from me without invitation, her smile sharp enough to cut glass. ""How lovely that you finally want to chat."" I wrapped my fingers around my latte cup, letting the warmth steady me. ""You came to my home. You made demands. I think we need to clarify a few things."" ""Of course."" Veronica ordered a cappuccino from the hovering waiter, her voice honey-sweet. ""Though I'm not sure what there is to clarify. Cooper wants out, darling. Surely you've noticed he's been... distant lately?"" The casual cruelty in her tone made my jaw clench, but I kept my voice level. ""My marriage is between my husband and me."" ""Not anymore."" She leaned forward, her eyes glittering with malicious delight. ""He told me about your little anniversary dinner. How you tried so hard to recapture the magic, wearing that blue dress he used to love. But he was texting me the whole time, you know. Telling me how desperate you looked, how suffocating your devotion has become."" Each word was a calculated strike, designed to wound. I twisted my wedding ring, the familiar gesture now feeling like a nervous tic. ""He said you've become like a ghost in your own house,"" Veronica continued, stirring sugar into her cappuccino with deliberate slowness. ""Going through the motions of being a wife while he dreams of someone who actually excites him."" ""Stop."" The word came out sharper than I intended. But she was just getting started. ""Did you know he keeps a photo of me in his wallet? Right behind your wedding picture. He showed it to me last week when we were in your bed—"" ""You're lying."" But even as I said it, I could picture it. Cooper's wallet, the one I'd given him for Christmas two years ago, containing evidence of my replacement. ""Am I?"" Veronica's smile widened. ""He loves the way I taste, Luna. The way I move. The way I make him feel like a man instead of a guilty obligation. He told me you just lie there now, like you're doing him a favor."" The coffee shop around us blurred at the edges. Other conversations faded to white noise. All I could hear was this woman—this stranger—describing the intimate details of my husband's betrayal with the casual tone of someone discussing the weather. ""You want specifics?"" Veronica leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper that somehow felt more violent than shouting. ""Last Tuesday, when you thought he was working late? We were at the Ritz. He bought me the diamond earrings I'm wearing right now. And when I asked him why he was still pretending with you, do you know what he said?"" I couldn't speak. Couldn't breathe. ""He said you'd given up so much for him that leaving you felt like kicking a wounded animal. But pity isn't love, Luna. And I'm tired of waiting for him to grow a spine."" Something inside me snapped. The careful composure I'd maintained, the dignity I'd wrapped around myself like armor—it all crumbled in an instant. I stood so abruptly my chair scraped against the marble floor, the sound echoing through the suddenly quiet café. ""You want him?"" My voice was steady, but my hand was already moving, lifting my latte cup. ""Then you can have him."" The hot liquid hit her face with a satisfying splash. Veronica shrieked, coffee dripping from her perfectly styled hair onto her red dress, the expensive fabric darkening with stains that would never come out. ""You psychotic bitch!"" She jumped up, grabbing napkins from nearby tables while other patrons stared in shock. I set the empty cup down with deliberate care, my hands surprisingly steady now. ""But understand this, Veronica—I won't surrender my marriage without a fight. If you want to play games, we'll play. But I've been Mrs. Cooper Watkins for eight years, and I know things about him you haven't even dreamed of yet."" I walked out of that café with my head high, leaving her dripping and furious behind me. But as the afternoon air hit my face, the temporary satisfaction faded, replaced by a cold certainty that this was only the beginning. That evening, I waited until I heard the shower running upstairs before opening Cooper's laptop. My hands shook as I navigated through his files, searching for evidence I both desperately needed and desperately feared to find. The folder was buried deep, labeled innocuously as ""Client Files 2024."" But the contents made my world collapse all over again. Videos. Dozens of them. Cooper and Veronica in hotel rooms, in his office, and—my stomach lurched—in our bedroom. Our bed, where I'd slept beside him just last night, where we'd made love on our anniversary just days ago. I watched just enough to confirm what I already knew, then closed the laptop with trembling fingers. Upstairs, the shower was still running. Cooper would emerge soon, probably kiss my forehead and ask about my day like he had every night for eight years. But I was done pretending. I moved through the house like a sleepwalker, gathering my pillows and nightgown, carrying them to the guest room I hadn't used since we'd redecorated it three years ago. The bed felt foreign and cold, but not as cold as the space beside Cooper had become. When he found me there an hour later, his hair still damp from his shower, confusion creased his features. ""Luna? What are you doing in here?"" I looked up from the book I wasn't really reading, my expression carefully neutral. ""I couldn't sleep. Didn't want to disturb you."" He lingered in the doorway, and for a moment, I thought he might confess everything. Instead, he simply nodded. ""Okay. Sleep well."" After he left, I opened my phone and began researching divorce attorneys, my wedding ring catching the lamplight as I scrolled through reviews and credentials. Tomorrow, I would start building my case. Tonight, I would mourn the death of my marriage in silence. The woman who had thrown coffee in Veronica's face was still there, simmering beneath my composed surface. And she was just getting started.

Chapter 3

I sat on my kitchen floor, back pressed against the cold cabinets, staring at the empty wine glass in my hand. The house felt too large, too quiet, too full of memories I could no longer trust. My phone buzzed beside me—another message from Cooper claiming he'd be working late. Again. The doorbell rang, startling me from my trance. For a moment, I feared it might be Veronica, back with more venom and demands. Instead, Sarah's familiar voice called through the door. ""Luna? It's me. Open up."" I hadn't called her. Hadn't called anyone. But Sarah had always possessed an uncanny ability to sense when I needed her most. When I opened the door, she took one look at my face and stepped inside without a word, grocery bags in both hands. ""I brought reinforcements,"" she announced, pulling out a bottle of expensive red wine and a box of tissues. ""You look like you need both."" ""I'm fine,"" I lied, the practiced response slipping out automatically. Sarah set everything on the counter and turned to face me, arms crossed. ""Cut the crap, Luna. I've known you since college. You've been dodging my calls for three days, and your last text message was so perfectly composed it might as well have been written by a robot. What's going on?"" The concern in her eyes broke something inside me. The careful composure I'd maintained since discovering Cooper's betrayal—through confronting Veronica, through sleeping in separate beds, through researching divorce attorneys—suddenly crumbled. ""He's having an affair,"" I whispered, the words feeling strange on my tongue. Saying it aloud made it real in a way that even the videos hadn't. ""With someone named Veronica. She came to our house, Sarah. She stood in my kitchen and told me to step aside."" Sarah's face hardened. Without a word, she uncorked the wine, poured two generous glasses, and guided me to the couch. ""Start from the beginning."" So I did. I told her about the AirDrop name change, about Moonlight and Sunshine, about the confrontation at Café Lumière. I told her about the videos I'd found, about moving to the guest room, about Cooper's apparent obliviousness to the fact that I knew everything. ""And the worst part,"" I said, wiping away tears with the back of my hand, ""is that she looks like me. A younger, more polished version, but still... it's like he's trying to replace me with an upgraded model."" Sarah handed me a tissue. ""This isn't just an affair, Luna. This is something else entirely."" ""What do you mean?"" ""Normal mistresses don't show up at the wife's house making demands. They don't create social media accounts to taunt you. They hide. They keep secrets."" Sarah leaned forward, her expression grave. ""Veronica isn't just sleeping with your husband. She's trying to become you."" A chill ran down my spine as Sarah's words crystallized what I'd sensed but couldn't articulate. ""She wants my life."" ""Exactly. And that makes her dangerous in ways a typical homewrecker isn't."" Sarah refilled our glasses. ""This isn't just about sex for her. It's about identity theft—emotional identity theft. She's not just after Cooper; she's after everything you have. Your home, your status, your position as Mrs. Watkins."" I twisted my wedding ring, the familiar nervous habit now feeling like a countdown to its removal. ""Cooper's been acting strange lately. Jumpy. Checking his phone constantly."" ""Because she's got her hooks in him,"" Sarah said. ""Men like Cooper don't just leave marriages like yours without pressure. She's applying that pressure."" The doorbell rang again, making me jump. Sarah squeezed my hand. ""I'll get it."" She returned moments later, her expression a mixture of disgust and vindication, carrying a sleek black box tied with a red ribbon. ""Delivery for Mrs. Watkins,"" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. I opened the box with trembling fingers. Inside lay expensive red lingerie—La Perla, by the look of it—with a handwritten note: ""He prefers me in red. Maybe you should try it before he makes it official. —V"" Sarah took one look at my face and pulled out her phone. ""That's it. I'm calling James. He's the best divorce attorney in the city, and you're going to need him."" As she dialed, my phone buzzed with a text from Cooper: ""Need to work late again. Don't wait up."" I showed it to Sarah, who rolled her eyes. ""Of course he does."" What neither of us knew then was that across town, Cooper was staring in horror at his phone, where Veronica had just sent him a photo of herself standing on the ledge of her apartment balcony, captioned: ""If you leave me for her, this is what happens next.""",1,1763697331.0,novelsfree,2,1.0,False

1p2olna,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1p2olna/why_do_people_think_its_weird_to_just_sit_and_do/,Why do people think it's weird to just sit and do nothing?,"I'm 22F. At least once a day I like to sit, take in my environment, and think. Meditate. Sometimes about important stuff, sometimes about nonsense, and sometimes about nothing at all. I like to just be. I do this at home and in public. Sometimes if I'm sitting in a waiting room I'll go on my phone, and sometimes if I don't feel like going on my phone I'll just look straight ahead or at my feet or something and just be in the moment and think. 

My boyfriend caught me doing this tonight. He asked me to stop because it was weird and was making him uncomfortable. He's very reliant on his phone, so I get how the idea of sitting and doing nothing (instead of sitting on your phone when you have nothing else to do) is unusual to him. But I didn't like being called weird and told to stop doing something that's completely harmless. 

Well, I tried to look more into this, and I found this older Reddit post of someone saying that people were judging this guy sitting at a coffee shop and doing nothing, just sipping his coffee and looking at the table. And they called him a psychopath for that! And that's what I do! I love to sit in the dining center with a cup of coffee and meditate. What is so wrong with that? Does everyone that sees me doing that think I'm a psychopath? Not that I'm gonna stop or really care what people think of me, but I really want to know how many people find it weird and why? 


(Note that my boyfriend and I both have ADHD and are both medicated, since I've seen related posts discussing that)

1p2olb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p2olb7/ladies_i_have_a_story_and_i_want_to_know_if_i_35m/,Ladies. I have a story and I want to know if I (35M) was the bad guy and she (24F) was right to leave me.,"I will be walking you guys through my 4-year relationship with my now ex.

* Met in 2021
* She used to go to the same CrossFit gym, which I would go to daily.
* She would set up her workout station either really close to mine or directly next to mine.
* Started talking.
* She mentioned that she was just there to train to pass the physical fitness test for the Air Force.
* I offered to help her since I want to get closer to her.
* We would go on mile runs every night after the class was over.
* Eventually asked her to go out one night.
* Had a modest meal at a good local restaurant.
* She and I would then go out to other places almost daily (at night, after both of us were off from work).
* Asked her to come to my place and watch a movie, it was Maleficent (the first one).
* She comes, we cuddle on my couch as we watch the movie.
* I initiate some frottage, I am rubbing the side of her face with my nose and guiding her to lift her face up to meet mine without saying a word.
* She eventually does, and we start kissing. Not making out.
* I was very happy. She also told me that she really enjoyed it as well.
* Asked her to come to my place again after the gym a couple of days from the movie.
* she was reluctant to come because she said that things were moving too fast.
* I assured her that nothing was going to happen if she did not want it.
* She came by.
* We had sex.
* Her coming by after the gym became a daily thing. She would also sleep over a lot.
* We were inseparable.
* People at the gym would ask us to ""get a room"" because we were kind of touchy with each other.
* I get her pregnant.
* It's a boy!
* She is very hormonal during this period.
* Very emotionally unstable.
* She is currently living with her mother, sister, and aunt during the first 2 trimesters.
* Lowkey happy about this arrangement since my mother-in-law tells me about how terrible my lady is acting.
* I was visiting her place almost daily.
* She moves in with me when she was about 7 months pregnant.
* She had our child, all natural, no epidural or anything. No stitches needed.
* A few months passed, she had quit her job when she was 8 months pregnant and had not worked a job since.
* I did not mind at all, I wanted her to focus on taking care of our baby.
* I had to pick up extra jobs and work more hours to sustain: the house, myself, her, and our child.
* Mind you, I was also going to 3 different schools. (Finishing a Masters, Ed.D, and a PsyD).
* At one point, I was working 5 jobs, and doing 3 different programs at the same time.
* She was getting irritated with me because I had 3 big dogs (Belgian Malinois and one Leonberger) and keeping the floor clean was a bit tough.
* Also, I did not really cook or clean anything.
* I would help her with the baby, though. I changed many diapers, probably daily, when I had the time. I would also feed him and bathe him, it was no problem.
* She was getting mad about cleaning after the dogs and not receiving help from me for daily chores.
* She also did not like my ""controlling"" nature.
* What's controlling about me?
* I did not want to do things that I did not like, and if she wanted to do them, she was able to do it, just not with me (going to beach, travel, etc.)
* She would do a lot of things with her mother and sister.
* Eventually, she decided to leave me.
* I went to her mother's place and told her that this was a huge mistake. Our son was only about 5 months old at this point.
* She said that she would think about it and let me know later.
* She came back 4 days later.
* **This is a very important moment because her leaving me at this point made me resent her for the rest of the relationship subconsciously.**
* We continued our routine. She was a housewife, and I was essentially Julius from Everybody Hates Chris.
* She was not happy because I was not able to afford taking her out on dates, also, I was burning out from everything that I was doing.
* I told her: ""We just need to wait for me to graduate the Masters and Ed.D program. That way, I can get better-paying jobs and I will have a lot more free time for both of us"".
* ""Ugh, sure, but I don't know if I can last that long""
* I get her pregnant again (ooops).
* This time, I get to feel the entire brunt of her hormones.
* She decides to break up and leave again.
* She comes back a week later.
* **I am more resentful now.**
* Our baby girl is now born.
* Same deal as last time, but this time, she had a home birth.
* I am in love with my daughter.
* I take naps with her while hugging her.
* Fast forward some months.
* My ex is now very overwhelmed because she needs to take care of two babies by herself while I am out most of the day working.
* She continues to complain about the dogs leaving the floor a mess and her having to clean it daily.
* She is also starting to mention that she believes that she ""cannot be herself"" around me.
* When I asked her what she meant, she said, ""You have this standard of what people should do and I simply cannot just ""flow"" with you"".
* Mind you, my ex is the younger daughter of a single mother who spent all of her money making sure that she and her daughters could go on constant trips and eat out all the time. Luckily for my ex, her mother's father was wealthy, so he was able to pick up some of the slack that her mother was putting out.
* I told her that yes, I have an expectation for myself and also for her.
* I would get frustrated when she would leave the garage open all night (anyone could get into the house), leave the front door open (which caused my dogs to roam around the neighborhood unattended), and leave the stove on.
* She would attribute all of these things to ""I had a lot on my mind and things just slipped"".
* I was not allowed to be mad or frustrated at these things, though, because she would consider these things ""abusive"".
* She tried to leave me a third time, but her mother was selling the house, so she had nowhere to go, so she decided to stay.
* **Resentment keeps building.**
* Her mother sells the house, and has nowhere to live.
* I offer my home as a temporary refuge as long as her mother can cover the light bill ($400 per month).
* Mother accepts.
* Mother ends up living with us for a bit over a year.
* Mother and ex are always talking.
* Something happened, and she wants to leave for the 4th time.
* Ex is frantically trying to find a place to rent ASAP so that she, her mother, and the 2 babies can move out.
* I tried my best to help her out more.
* She realised that moving out was not a viable financial move, so she decided to stay.
* Her mother ended up buying a condo, so she moved out.
* My ex and I are now living together, alone, after a while.
* Ex is now taking an interest in a lot of the things that I like.
* Ex is not complaining about anything, she's just supporting me and helping me get over my jobs and schooling.
* Things are very good.
* One night, I come from work, she tells me that her sister and her boyfriend are going to be sleeping over our house for a few weeks while they visit for Thanksgiving.
* WhatTheActualHell.PNG
* ""Woman, why did you decide to approve this without discussing this with me first?""
* ""I did not feel like I needed to since she's my sister and you already know her"".
* ""Yes, that is true, but she is currently dating an illegal immigrant, and she has only known him for about 4 months. I do not want him in my house; she can stay, but not him"".
* ""OMG, you are so controlling, I am done. I cannot be with you"".
* This is the 5th time at this point. I tell her: ""whatever"".
* We are ""broken up"" but we are still living together, sleeping in the same bed, having sex, and just living the same day-to-day.
* I finally graduate from my Masters program. Sweet.JPEG
* I tell her that I would like help getting ready for my state exam.
* She does, we are studying for a few hours every single night.
* I am feeling really close to her, we even sometimes to Uber Eats deliveries while studying.
* She tells me that she had a wedding that she was invited to, and she wanted me to go with her.
* I tell her, ""sure, but that is a request for people who are in a relationship, are we back together?""
* ""No, I told you that I cannot be with you"".
* ""Okay, then you can go by yourself"".
* She ends up going there by herself.
* I also decided to give her a snippet of what life is like with divorced couples.
* I told her that our children would be spending Thanksgiving with her but they would be spending Christmas with my family.
* She did not like that idea.
* It was now December 2024, I took my state exam, and I passed.
* She said that to celebrate, we should go to LegoLand since our son loves Legos.
* I said sure.
* Things were good, but I still wanted my woman back.
* I decided to meet a female gym buddy one night since I knew that she had just left a relationship, and I wanted to learn from her what I could do to get my ex back.
* My ex was supposed to do some hours of Uber Eats that night, but she said that she had cancelled so that she could spend some time with me.
* My retarded/autistic ass decided to ignore that since my goal was to meet this other lady so that she could tell me how to get back with the mother of my children. So I left anyway, I told my ex that I was meeting someone.
* Meet with the gym buddy, had a conversation, lasted about 2 hours.
* Come back home.
* Put on my pajamas and get in bed.
* Ex wakes me up, she's dripping wet.
* We had amazing sex (the last time we had sex). During the whole thing, she kept asking me ""You fucked her didn't you?"" I initially told her ""No"", but she kept saying ""You're lying, I know you fucked her"", I noticed how turned on she was, so I (again, retard/austistic) thought that the though of me being intimate with another woman was turning her on a lot and since I did not want to ruin the moment I told her ""Sure, I fucked her"".
* After we both finished (she finished a few times), she left the room and started crying.
* WaitThisWholeOperationWasYourIdea.webb
* She told me that I was unfaithful and all these things.
* I told her, ""You broke up with me...""
* ""Yes, but I was still having sex with you and cleaning and everything"".
* ""That may be, but I did ask you to give me the title back several times, and you refused every time"".
* She remained quiet and kept crying.
* I go to sleep.
* She slept on the sofa.
* From that moment on, she never slept on our bed again.
* She downloaded a dating app in secrecy too.
* While I took our children for Christmas, she met with a guy she met on the dating app.
* Her mother knew about this and said nothing about it...
* My ex is now mistreating me a lot; she is being rude, dismissive, and outright unpleasant to be around.
* I hear her phone buzz one day while she is in the bathroom. I check the notification to let her know who is contacting her. I see the notification from a guy, and my ex is having flirtatious/sexy chats with this other guy.
* I decided to keep quiet for the time being.
* She keeps mistreating me.
* Eventually, I cannot take it anymore, and I ask her about the guy that she had been texting.
* She spills the beans.
* I asked her if she had already had sex with the man.
* She said, ""No, I have not even kissed him, we just met for coffee once during Christmas when I did not have the babies"".
* ""I see, okay, from now on, since he is your new romantic interest, you can ask him for whatever you need. I will not be paying your phone bill anymore, since I will not pay so that you can text and talk to another man, and if you ever want to go out or do whatever, contact him instead"".
* She responded, ""I seriously cannot live like this, I am leaving"".
* I told her, ""You have 2 babies, a 2-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl, you grew up without a father, do you really want to break up the family again and have them grow up without a father?""
* She replied, ""They'll be fine, they'll have me and my mother, they'll be happy"".
* She left the following day.
* She would tell you that I was ""Unattentive, unreasonable, controlling, and a narcissist"".
* I told her that she just needed to make this sacrifice for now until I was able to get better jobs and finish my 2/3 degrees.
* By the time that she left, I had gone down 2 degrees and gone from 5 jobs to 3 jobs.
* I was very angry because she was there since the very beginning, and she should benefit from the fruits of our sacrifice. But she left it all to ""be free"". In the meantime, our babies are growing up without a father.
* My ex is now a single mother, her mother was a single mother too, and now, statistically, our daughter will end up being a single mother too.
* I never cheated on her, I never put my hands on her, and I would help with our children whenever I could.
* My biggest, according to her, was ""you prioritized money over our relationship"".
* Of course I did, I was freaking laying the financial foundation for the rest of our lives....
* She did not care. Now she is a single mother, making $17 an hour (plus some tips) while our children go to daycare.
* Our boy is growing up like a sissy because he lives in a house full of women (he cries about everything).
* My daughter will most likely grow up with Borderline Personality Disorder because of the abandonment that she will feel once she becomes more conscious.
* All of these things I have explained to my ex. But my ex says that she feels ""free now"" and that she can ""flow"" with her mother all the time and that this arrangement is preferable to being with me.

TL;DR: My ex broke up with me after having 2 babies together, I was never unfaithful or abusive, I was a ""workaholic"" because I needed to support myself, my ex, and our 2 children. She did not have a job. She tried to leave 4 times throughout the relationship, but she finally left for real on her 5th try. I also held her to a standard of ""I am the final decision maker in this house"" (even though I rarely exercised it). She left because I ""prioritized money over quality time"". Mind you, if she ever wanted to do something, all she had to do was ask.

Was my ex right to leave? I keep thinking that I should fight for the relationship because I do not want my children to grow up screwed up (read the statistics about children who grow up in fatherless homes). Should I leave it alone?",0,1763697169.0,Advice,4,0.5,False

Do you wanna try a bunch of stuff, hand curated by your internet friend? 

Blind buying sucks, especially if your wife is picky.
But I finally figured out some stuff she really likes, so now I’m trying to thin out the closet of decants that were rejects in her eyes, because she makes me sleep outside if I wear some of these. But you? You’re gonna love every single one of these 

So we’ve got 3 bundles

~~First is Penhaligons Portraits collection, fill levels on all of these seen in photos. Get to know all of them, there’s some stunners other than just Mr. sam in here. Try all these out for $27, shipping and G&S included.~~. **SOLD**

[Pictures](https://ibb.co/album/ymSM9p)

Next is the LV bundle, all are official LV samples except nouveau monde that was purchased from a lovely decanter on here. See photos for levels of a used meteorè and NM. In here are some nukes, like ombré nomad, Les Sables Roses, and fantasmagory. Like to see this one go for $65 shipped and g&s included. 

[Pictures](https://ibb.co/album/xt01Dw)

Annnd lastly, the mess. These all have been purchased from the fine folks of this sub. All have been ordered as 1 or 2 mL’s, and most have been sprayed at most on paper and / or on a hand. There’s some hype names on here, cuz I like seeing what they’re about, so save your money on a scary blind guy, and grab a bunch of smells to try. Apologize in advance for formatting, I’m on mobile doing this so yeah. All of these have enough juice for smell testing, and probably a few wears. Please see photos, and if you want more specific ones let me know. I’d really like to sell all of these as a whole lots so I’m going to try to price them for sale, but there is some nice juice in here. 

Looking to get rid of all 38 of these for $135 shipping and G&S included

1p2oi3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1p2oi3p/hey_stinky/,Hey stinky,"I can't get you out of my head. I know I’m the one who ended things; once, and then again stayed true to my decision. I know that and i keep having to remind myself that i did that for a reason, and whatever the reason may be it is still the decision that i made. And yet, part of me felt from the beginning like it wasn’t completely my decision. I sincerely hope you don’t see this. But if you do i am sorry. I don’t want to disrupt any healing you might be doing. It’s just that, you said i was worth it; and maybe I’m just hoping that’s true about me as a person…that i really am worth it. I’ve been going to therapy lately too, and I’ve brought you up a lot already. We talked about how i let other peoples opinions influence me too much, and i think i let that be a factor in our breakup when it should’ve been entirely my decision. I know we did have our issues…but i guess i can’t stop thinking about how it all went down. I really didn’t give you a chance. I didn’t communicate ahead of time about how i was feeling, and i talked to my mom and she told me i needed to end things with you then and there. And i know she had a point, the issues were real and they were really affecting me, but i really wish i could go back in time and do things differently. I wish i had just told you what was going on and given you a chance to prove yourself before i talked to my mom or my friends. Of course they’re going to side with me, they think they’re protecting me and maybe they were, but i wish more than anything i just hadn’t said anything to anyone until i had spoken to you. I feel so much regret. So so much. The reason i can’t just say this to you is because i can’t act like the issues and way i was feeling weren’t real, and i have no way of knowing whether that all would’ve gotten better or not. But that’s a double edged sword. Is that why you haunt me all day every day? Because it’s all in my mind? It’s all what could have or could not have been. Not to mention that it all felt cruel. I don’t ever want to be cruel. You’re someone who i loved (love?). i mentioned to my therapist how if you had been on that couch with me and i told the both of you how i let others opinions be the deciding factor in our breakup, or rather the final straw, that you would have probably been mad at me. And she said something that i can’t stop thinking about. “Wouldn’t he have the right to be mad?” And she’s right. I think part of why i can’t reach out is the shame that i feel, knowing that i couldn’t handle you being mad at me right now. I sometimes wish we were together. But i don’t think we can be. But i don’t know….it was really hard on me. I think about how you would say that you hated how the people in your life walked on eggshells around you, like they were worried you wouldn’t be able to handle it, and I’m sorry that i ended up being another person to make you feel that way, but frankly you do need to look inward. Something i think about a lot for myself and for others is the common thread; if every single person in your life is saying the same thing, maybe they aren’t the issue but it’s an issue of your own that you need to work on. But i know it’s more complicated than that for you. But nonetheless, complicated or not, it’s still going to affect others around you. I know you said you wanted to fight for this more than anything. I often wonder if you still are. I know i don’t have a right to, but i secretly hope you still are. You’re allowed to move on and i guess you should…and i probably should too…and yet i keep driving by the park and other places where we would spend time together, hoping that you’ll be there too. I miss the things we did together. I miss how we had fun and i miss feeling like a kid with you. I keep hoping that one day down the line we cross paths, we sit down and talk, maybe we grab a coffee and you tell me you’ve decided to get medicated, or go to therapy specifically addressed toward your diagnosis, and you tell me that your life is full and good, but maybe something is still missing, that you still want to be with me. Geez, is that selfish of me? I want to be a strong and complete person, and i think I’m headed in the right direction. And yet i still keep thinking of what could be, i still keep missing you. I want to have my own life that i can share with you. I’m sorry, truly. I know I’ve said it already. And i know that you’re gone now. You’re really truly gone. You don’t talk to me, you don’t reach out…i hope you’re doing well. Truly and more than anything i just hope that you’re okay. I miss you so much, okay? Good luck with the cars and good luck on your adventures. I hope you get what you deserve in life. I love you. ",0,1763696902.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.5,False

Real patriotic stuff.

Operation Enduring Kelp.
Two weeks tops, they said.
Just hold the line at Jellyfish Fields so the locals could vote or something.

I believed it. I was nineteen, still porous, still thought the world worked like a Saturday morning.

I shipped out with the 1st Sponge Expeditionary Unit. Gary didn’t understand. He just rubbed against my leg that morning, purring that slow, trusting purr.
I told him I’d be back by dinner with his favorite can. 
I still owe him that can. 

The Krill Qaeda hid in the coral caves and screamed “Allahu Akbarnacle” right before the world went white.

First patrol we rolled through a village that used to sell ice-cream kelp cones.

Everything was burned.
The only thing moving was a tiny clownfish in a tiny burqa, rocking next to what was left of her dad.
I gave her the chocolate coral bar from my MRE. She stared at it like she’d never seen candy before. I still see those eyes when I try to sleep.

We lost Patrick on Christmas Eve.
Jellyfish IED. There wasn’t enough of him left to fill a Krabby Patty bun.
We mailed his dog tags home in a sandwich bag.

Sandy never came home.
Last postcard said “extended again.”
Then nothing.

Squidward took an RPG on Conch Street.
Lost both tentacles.
They say he plays the same four notes in the psych ward now, over and over, like he’s trying to remember the rest of the song.

Third tour they made me squad leader. Promoted me the same week they pinned the Purple Barnacle on me for the shrapnel that turned my left leg into swiss cheese.

The medal’s shaped like a starfish.
Still have it.
Still don’t know what the hell it’s for.

Docs at Bethesda-on-the-Reef say 
the blast waves liquefied something inside.

My pores don’t close anymore.
I leak. Constantly. Yellow, sometimes pink.

They gave me a wheelchair and a blanket that smells like iodine and lost causes. The VA waiting room plays the same three songs on loop. One of them is the Krusty Krab jingle.
Every time it comes on I shake so hard the nurse has to hold my coffee.

Sometimes I roll past the window and watch the new kids hunting jellyfish like we used to.
Laughing.

I want to scream that it’s all a lie, that the jellyfish don’t care who’s in charge, that nothing we did mattered, that twenty years later nobody even remembers why we were there.

1. Approval online by Mazda Financial. (Approved for up to 75k)

2. I find the car I want, Mazda CX-90 Turbo S Premium Plus \~57k

3. Visit the dealer, drove the car 5 minutes, I don't need anything else.  Its a done deal.

4. I ask dealer for three things.  Don't waste my time with this bait and switch stuff.  Get the papers together and call me with the offer.  When we get to finance, please don't upsell me on things, the answer is already ""NO"". I was transparent.  I explained that I was going to get a coffee.  Call me before I finish my coffee and I'll come back that day to do the deal.  (I don't even know the terms or rate.)

5. Im gone five minutes.  Phone rings.  We need you to fill out this credit app.  I pause....why I ask? Im approved with the lender.  He attempts to tell me theirs a problem with the app.  Fill this out.  I asked him to just proceed with the approval as it is and get me the offer.  Rest of the day, client.  Sunday passes (no car sales that day). Monday... crickets.  Tuesday hey did you fill out that app?  My check engine light comes on in my head.    I said no deal.  Consider my offer withdrawn.

I still want the car.  I locate another car about 50 miles away.  I ask will they honor my approval from Mazda.  Well we need to pull credit..... check oil light in my head comes on. I explain I have an approval, yada yada yada.   This guy tells me it's so they can verify who I am???  Wait, you mean my approval and my drivers license aren't proof of who I am??  

Please if you work for Mazda or in the industry, help me understand.  Ive walked into VW with an approved purchase online..  Drove out with no problems.  Is this normal?  Is this a shift in the market or is it just dumb sales?",7,1763696521.0,carbuying,9,0.89,False

On the date, I asked if it was okay to talk about future goals/values/beliefs, to avoid wasting time. She agreed and liked that idea. 

It led to her asking if I want to get married and have kids. I told her no kids (have a vasectomy scheduled for next year. YAY!!!!!), and I'm leaning towards no marriage due to risks involved. 

She didn't want kids either, but she questioned if I want to be loyal. I said that I'm looking for a life-long partner, and marriage isn't needed for that loyalty.

She spoke for I guess 30 seconds talking about marriage helping men live longer, be happier, healthier, etc. 

I said that those stats aren't proof of correlation, and that being married won't magically make me free from diseases/cancer, and that happiness is subjective.

I also pointed out that me going to the gym six days a week, and having a stable diet with meal prepping every Sunday puts me ahead of many married men and women. 

I assume I was a little blunt with my tone because she looked at her phone and said she had to go. (Coffee date). I just said okay, and that it was nice to meet her.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I started w them beginning of nov of last year and my bday is mid nov. this is not my first family, nor the first time I start a job around my bday time. In the past, each and every time I’ve had a bday, I’ve been given a little recognition from the NF I’ve worked for with kids drawings, a cupcake, chocolates, small gift cards, etc.  I obvi don’t ask for much, but it’s nice to be recognized. I’m very appreciative when things like this have been done in the past bc to me it’s the little things that matter and I always get kids bday/holiday gifts and include a family gift for the parents as well. 
My current NF didn’t acknowledge my bday last year, but I really didn’t care, as I had just started with them. I just turned a year w them the first of this month and my bday was 14 days later. Nothing from the family, nor kids. Not a “thanks for sticking around for a year” or “happy bday” drawing from the NK or anything. Instead, the following Monday when I went back to work (my bday was on a friday— I worked and the mom was off and just lounging around the house all day) they asked how my weekend was and what I did. I told them “good, my family had a small celebration for me” and the NM says “oh, that’s right, it was your bday. Sorry, we forgot.” And went back to making her coffee and left me her dirty morning dishes before she left for work. I don’t expect a bonus or fancy gifts or anything, just a little recognition, ya know? I’ve been working full time for them for a year now. I’ve worked for many other families before, but this is the first time I feel under appreciated and like I’m just “the help” for them.

This shutdown was a tough one, especially with the holidays right around the corner. Now that pay is back, we’ve got some breathing room — but with another possible round coming in late January, I figured I’d share a few of my frugal saving habits that help me stretch my money and keep expenses lower than income. I’ve always been a smart shopper and still value quality>quantity. I’ve saved a lot with my “low-buy” year to prepare me for moments like this. Hopefully some of these ideas help you and your family too.

- - - - - 

- Switched phone plan to Mint mobile ($15 month now) from former plan of $70 a month. I live in the DMV and have service everywhere I go - unlimited too! If you pay out the full year, you get an extra discount! 

- My 6 month auto premium with Geico was $647 but I did some shopping around and progressive gave me a better policy for only $418!

- Did the same for home insurance! I was with Progressive paying $1800ish and USAA locked me in with $1501/annual. All the Pennie’s count! 

- Aldi/Lidl for grocery shopping! I buy the whole fruit instead of pre-cut fruit since you get way more for your money, and always buying what I NEED. I also buy multi-use items too, example, I stopped buying coffee creamer and learned to appreciate hot milk with my coffee, and use that same milk to learn how to make my own Alfredo, protein shakes, etc.

- I dedicate Black Friday to buying my annual needs in BULK and discounted! I buy toothpaste, toilet paper, body wash, shampoo, deodorants, face wash, moisturizers, supplements, SPF (use my FSA) that’ll last me for the year and saves me a lot of $$! I bought a lot during BF2024 that it’ll last me into late 2026.

- Always get my gas at BJ’s or even use UPSIDE for those moments I’m not near one (you get cash back on gas/restaurants but I only use mine for gas).

 - Not a lot of people are into Thrifting but I’m a big thrifter and 90% of my closet are thrifted quality brand name clothes !! You’ll find sooooooo many good deals and I even do a “Thriftmas”. Trust me - a lot of people donate items that can be regifted!

- I called my internet and bargained with them to lower the price. I got them to budge the second time LOLOLOL. 

- Max all the benefits to any credit card deal you have. Example, I have an American Express plat card and we get monthly credits for Uber, Disney/Hulu/ESPN Package, YouTube premium, Walmart + (with Paramount +!!!) subscriptions. I travel a lot so this card spoils me with CLEAR and Priority Pass and suits my needs.

- Learned how to do my own oil changes!!! Game changer and saves me a ton of money.

- Are you a student as well? I’m a part time masters student and qualify for discount Apple Music+TV for the year and other discounts!

- This past year I refinanced my house to now 5.4% from a 6.1% - works for me.

- Got a short-term roommate (quite the adjustment) but def cut down on my biggest monthly expense and helped me save more.

Any other tips?

**The Game:**

Everybody's got their demons. You can see 'em. Some people got angels watchin' over 'em too. But you ain't got an angel. Nobody who can see 'em gets one. Wonder what that's about.

**What I Like About This One:**

A demonic answer to Noah's Yacht, this one has a very similar diceless system, right up until you run out of Grace. I think this one is a better game, though.

I'm not a Christian myself but I love Christian imagery and art and a lot of the concepts that are rolled into it. In Nomine is one of my favorite game milieus of all time, and I think of these little diceless games as a sort of love-letter to/crack-ship of In Nomine and Nobilis.

1p2nzyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/grok/comments/1p2nzyp/would_you_read_this_grok_dystopia_fiction/,Would you read this - Grok dystopia fiction,"1. The hum began somewhere south of Winnemucca, a low, unceasing B-flat that rode the night wind across the playa and slipped under the skin like a second pulse. Not loud, never loud; just present, the way gravity is present. People said you got used to it, the way Londoners once got used to coal smoke or Californians got used to the smell of wildfire season, but nobody ever really did. A tech journalist from San Francisco had started calling it the Choir back in ’22 (half mockery, half reverence).
	The parent company issued no statement, which itself became a kind of statement. A week later the phrase appeared in a white paper on “community acoustic integration,” footnote 14, no quotation marks. By the following quarter it was in the annual report, tucked between charts on carbon intensity and renewable-energy certificates, as neutral as the word “infrastructure.” Someone, somewhere, had run the numbers and discovered that awe paid better royalties than silence. Three hundred thousand servers (just one congregation among dozens scattered from Council Bluffs to Loudoun County, from The Dalles to Goodyear) breathed in perfect synchrony, exhaling waste heat that turned a hundred-mile stretch of Nevada night into a permanent, bruised, sodium-orange false dawn.
	At 3:14 a.m. the Choir was singing its softest, and in the cracked parking lot of the decommissioned Flying J, Elias Crowther sat on the hood of a rust-pocked Corolla listening the way sailors once listened for sirens, half terrified, half in love.
	
	He came most nights now, when the autonomous stacks thinned to a single file and their lidar crowns dimmed to amber courtesy mode. The last human-driven rig had vanished from this stretch of 95 sometime around ’24 (quietly, the way everything human vanished), replaced by the soft electric whine of platoons that never tired, never pissed, never played Waylon on the CB. The Flying J had shuttered its pumps in ’19, margins murdered by the same routing engines that now kept the sky permanently lit. The lot belonged to dust devils, the occasional jackrabbit, and whatever still moved on obsolete registration.
	Elias parked nose-out, always, the Corolla aimed down the access road like a museum piece waiting for a war that never quite arrived. The car was pre-Tesla, pre-solid-state, pre-everything: a 2011 four-cylinder that drank ancient hydrocarbons and asked nothing of the grid. Its plates had expired in ’23; the state’s camera gantries read them, shrugged, and logged the anomaly for a subsystem that no one monitored anymore. He killed the engine—actually killed it, no sleep mode, no silent handshake with a mothership—and the silence that followed felt illicit, like switching off a respirator.
	Overhead, the quarterly compliance drone made its pass: a matte-black octocopter the size of a dining table, running a lazy racetrack pattern at two hundred feet. Red anti-collision strobes, no markings except a small county seal that looked embarrassed to be there. It lingered above the lot for the regulation twelve seconds, decided a single heat signature in a derelict vehicle did not rise to the level of incident, and banked south toward the facility perimeter where real anomalies went to die. Elias waited until its strobes dissolved into the orange haze, then eased the door open with the soft, rusty sigh only old steel can make.
	The battery under the hood was older than half the silicon singing three miles away, swollen and sulfated, yet it still turned the starter on the third try when he needed it to. He left it undisturbed tonight. He preferred the quiet that had weight, the kind that remembered internal combustion and the minor blasphemy of not being watched.
	He brought no phone, no light, only a thermos of coffee gone cold hours ago and, sometimes, a spiral notebook whose pages he never showed anyone. He would sit on the hood until the metal leeched the last heat from his thighs, then slide down and lean against the fender, back to the driver-side door, palms flat on warm roof metal like a man taking the temperature of something vast and sick. The posture looked casual from a distance; up close it resembled listening through bone.
	Some nights the wind carried particulate (fine white dust off the playa that tasted of old lakes and older bombs) and he let it settle on his tongue the way monks once tasted ash. Other nights the air was so still the Choir seemed to come from inside his own chest, a second set of lungs made of copper and cooling fans. He timed his breaths to it anyway, the way a failing couple will still match steps on a sidewalk out of muscle memory.
	There were patterns if you waited long enough. A soft click every 4.7 seconds (some scheduler somewhere yielding). A fractional drop in pitch when the grid operator shaved two megawatts for California. Once, at 4:03 a.m. on a Tuesday no one would ever remember, the note wavered half a semitone and every coyote for twenty miles answered at once, a ragged, rising howl that sounded almost like laughter. Elias wrote the time in the margin of his notebook and underlined it twice, though he wasn’t sure why.
	
	The sky above the facility never went fully dark anymore, only darker, the color of a television tuned to a dead channel if the channel had once belonged to Hell. He had begun to think of the glow as a negative sunrise: light that rose from the ground instead of the east, promising nothing. He watched it the way previous generations watched cathedral windows or missile silos (same mixture of dread and consolation).

	He stayed until the first real light threatened, until the sodium orange began to bleed into a bruised lavender that meant another rotation of the planet had occurred without incident or revelation. Then he capped the thermos, slipped back inside the car, and let the Corolla roll forward on idle until he reached the county road. He never turned the headlights on until he was half a mile gone, as if the dark might still need him for something it hadn’t yet named.
Most mornings he drove north toward Gerlach, windows down, letting the wind scour the dust from his hair and the Choir from his ears. It never quite worked. By nightfall the note would be there again, patient, intimate, waiting in the bones.
	
	He always came back.",0,1763695677.0,grok,1,0.5,False

Decided I gotta chill out since it was becoming a habit, and I wanna get to the highest possible skill level in my sport of choice, (cross country skiing). I've been craving a cold lager but not giving in. The longer the better. And also its race season for me. Its probably the worst thing I could be filling myself with.
I feel more alert though, and also I wasn't a huge overthinker before, but I'm definitely not one now. I always found after a few drinks or getting stoned, I would tend to get emotional or paranoid about all kinds of crap. Definitely not the case now, thats gone down to being virtually non existent.
I also crave sweets more, but I suppose thats the lack of sugars? I would assume from lurking this sub that these things are normal? When I stopped using weed after using it daily for a while, my dreams got weirdly vivid but now I hardly remember my dreams. I'll take that over weird nightmares or sleep paralysis any day.
And I love coffee but nowadays I haven't been feeling like I NEED it to get through the day passed that initial cup or 2 in the morning. Still drink a tun of it though, heh.
Anyhow, I'm liking this energy increase I'm feeling and wondering if any of yall have had the same? Its a nice feeling. I hope it stays.

1p2nyn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1p2nyn0/they_dont_want_us_to_know/,They don’t want us to know,"It is apparent today more than ever that our government has its own agenda against the American people. They would rather control and manipulate the ones they're supposed to protect. Stealing, murder and experimentation are just some of the things they are guilty of. That's why I've decided to share a story that happened to me in my twenties. My father had recently passed and left me the family farm. It was about twenty acres with cows, pigs and chickens. I'd always planned to take over the family business but it happened sooner than I expected.

After a long day of tending to the many animals. I was sitting on my porch; gazing up at the moon. It was hard work managing so much on your own. But memories of my old dad kept me going. I remember it was almost nine o'clock and I was about to call it a night. I took one last look at the starry sky before noticing something peculiar. A giant ball of fire came into view, instantly grabbing my attention. “Was this some kind of meteor?”, I wondered. As I watched, it made strange movements. Whizzing back and forth or staying perfectly still. But the fire got bigger very fast, causing the object to crash into my cow field. What came after was a large explosion that sent all of my animals into a frenzy.

I grabbed a flashlight and my fathers rifle before rushing to the scene. What I saw there was something no one would ever believe. It was a metallic and circular object that was cracked open like an egg. As I moved closer, I was able to see inside. There were blinking lights, a small seat and what seemed to be tiny controls. Before I could study this strange object, a voice called out to me. It was asking for help and nearly made me jump out of my skin. This is due to the fact that it didn't come from anywhere in the field. But instead, the voice called out to me in my own head. I darted around like a mad man thinking I'd gone crazy.

But it was quick to calm me and promised I was alright. “It's okay, I'm hurt…come to me”. Like I was hypnotized, I turned and walked a few feet away from the destroyed object. Laying on the edge of the crater was something out of this world. A small being about three feet tall, it had big bulging eyes and a giant head. Its body was covered in deep gashes from the crash. There was a strange grey liquid oozing from its wounds; I assumed it was blood. I kneeled down beside it, unsure of what to do. It slowly raised its three fingered hand and I grabbed onto it. His skin was grey and oily to the touch. It locked eyes with me before speaking telepathically again.

“I'm in so much pain human…I need you to finish me”. I don't know what most folks would have done, but I didn't want to hurt this creature. I explained that I could call for help, that a hospital could save him. But alas, his words echoed in my head over and over. He was dying and wanted me to end his suffering. So I gripped my fathers rifle and did what needed to be done. Unsure of what to do next, I called the police. The operator thought I was crazy but you could see the smoke from miles away. So they had to send someone out. One cop car quickly turned into two then three. The officers stood over the wreckage confused and scared. I didn't blame them, I still didn't know what to make of all this.

Pretty soon, military vehicles pulled down my one way driveway. They parked in a way that was blocking us from viewing the wreckage. I sat on my porch for forever wondering what was going to happen. There were cops, government men in black suits. And at one point, even guys in hazmat suits. I was never into the paranormal, but even I knew something odd was going on here. That thing wasn't from this world and they knew that. Hours passed and it was after 2 am. A cop came up to me and told me everything was taken care of. He also said that there were gonna be some people here to talk to me first thing in the morning.

He was right about that, the very next day I got a knock at my door. It was a man dressed in a black suit holding a briefcase. He told me his name was frank and asked if he could come inside. I invited him in and put on some coffee. He took it black and sat at the table with a tired expression. “Im just gonna get straight to the point”, he said. “Your land is of interest to the federal government. We'd like to offer you a substantial amount to buy it”. He then put a briefcase on the table and opened it up. There was so much money that I nearly passed out. Stacks upon stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. The man handed me a clipboard and told me to sign on the dotted line.

All that money seemed life changing, but money couldn't make up for memories. My dad worked hard to build this place and I had no right to sell it. I wiped the drool from my face and pushed the briefcase away. I explained that this was family land and I couldn't part with it. He let out a sigh and dropped his head. “That’s very unfortunate to hear. The money was worth far more than this dried up old land”. After offending me, he took the money and left. Things soon went back to normal, or so I thought. I got up early and tended to my farm like always. Feeding all the animals and cleaning up after them. The first thing I noticed was that big eighteen wheelers passed in front of my home.

There were fleets of four and five followed by military vehicles. A different construction company rolled through everyday. Late at night I could hear helicopters flying over my property. So close that my entire house was shaking. My animals stayed spooked and running all over the place. I had no idea what they were doing; there were only woods out here. Things went like this for five months straight; then I’d receive one last visit. Another black vehicle carrying my new buddy Frank. Only this time, he was accompanied by two armed soldiers. He greeted me with a handshake and a smile. Then held up a stack of papers that would change my life. He said that my farm was on military property and I needed to leave. I told him he's crazy, this farm was built by my father forty years ago. He referred to the papers again, assuring me this land had always belonged to uncle sam. I told him he needed to leave now before I called the police. The soldiers stepped up and told me I would be the one leaving. They stuck their rifles in my face and escorted me to my truck. 

What was happening, this was my home and they were taking it from me? I went to the police, lawyers, no one wanted to help me. Next thing I knew I was on the streets with nowhere to go. As of my writing this, I'm living in a rundown apartment and working at a grocery store. I've gone back to my home several times and have been turned away. A giant fence was installed and I couldn't have any of my belongings. The worst part is, I know this is my land. But I don't have any evidence to prove it...they took everything. This all started when I discovered that creature. Perhaps they thought my land was a hot bed for extraterrestrials. And the US government wanted it no matter how low they had to sink.

Regardless, my life was stolen and I'm ready to tell my story. In this country we're supposed to feel safe and live free. But there is a monster lurking just beneath the surface. One that will take what they want when they want and answer to nobody. One nation under lies and control; fight back and they’ll bury you…just like me.

1p2nw36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1p2nw36/i_think_im_somehow_recovering_this_is_my_story_so/,I think I'm somehow recovering - This is my story so far,"I'm not completely there yet, but things are getting better and better as the months go on. 

  
I developed GP late spring of last year. It started with me not being able to use the restroom without the help of laxatives. That was the first thing I noticed. I also noticed my abdomen was bloated constantly to an embarrassing extent. And I started to lose weight without even trying. I just wasn't as hungry anymore. This was welcome at first, I needed to lose weight. Probably why it took me a year to get diagnosed. And I was able to get by just using laxatives once or twice a week.

In the summer, I started not being able to finish my meals. I would leave more and more on my plate. Eventually I just started preparing smaller meals for myself because I was tired of wasting food. The once or twice a week laxative regimen stopped working, and I started having to take Miralax daily. Still couldn't use the bathroom without help. I had been dealing with digestive problems most of my life at that point. IBS, GERD. I was concerned, but apparently not enough to see the doctor. I'd reached out countless times for help with my digestion in the past, given pretty useless advice and was never even referred to a gastroenterologist before, so... I guess I didn't see the point. 

By the fall time, I could only eat half of what I used to at once. But I felt so hungry. I'd eat half a breakfast, then try to eat a meal bar a couple hours later and feel like I was dying from the pain. I was bloating so badly it was starting to make my chest hurt. The pressure was unreal. I weaned myself off of Miralax, thinking that was the problem, that I was overdoing the laxatives and that this was basically my fault. And I finally scheduled an appointment with a gastroenterologist, which I had to wait over four months for. 

During that time, I went on several elimination diets, including the low fodmap diet, just trying to figure out what was happening to my digestive system. No life-altering results from doing that. 

Finally got to see a gastroenterologist. Doing no tests, she diagnosed me with GERD and IBS-C, and put me on Linzess and Pantoprazole. And that's when things got really, really bad. The Linzess dehydrated me, and the pantoprazole exacerbated my delayed emptying and bloating. I ended up having such pain in my chest that I thought I was constantly having a heart attack. I took myself off of these meds after 3 weeks, couldn't take it anymore. At that point, a GES was ordered. In April of this year, I learned that I have moderate gastroparesis. 

By May I was barely eating. I couldn't eat solid food for like a month. I was slowly sipping on Boost drinks. I lost 10 pounds in one month. Every time I tried to eat solid food, I would get extremely nauseous and start to gag. I had never even heard the word ""gastroparesis"" prior to being told I was going to do a GES. After my diagnosis, my mental health took a dip. I was so scared. I made the mistake of reading the Wikipedia article on it. It says that gastroparesis is ""associated with poor outcomes."" I joined this subreddit, where I saw many tales of feeding tubes, TPN... My mind went to the worst places. I feared that I would become malnourished. 

And I guess that's the main reason I'm here writing this. I want to give you guys hope that things don't always get worse. They can get better. 

By June I could eat one small meal per day. The other five were meal drinks. By July I could eat two small meals per day. By August, I could dine out again occasionally, though I could only eat a small amount at a time. By September, I could eat half of a normal restaurant serving at once. By October, I was eating half of my calories in solid food per day and dining out regularly. By November, here I am now with four meals per day instead of six, and three of them are solid. 

Things got better. And they got better relatively quickly. And it's looking like it's going to be uphill from here on out. I suppose only time will tell, but I am very hopeful for my digestive future. 

This is what I've done to recover: 

I've tried and failed many meds and other changes, but this is what has worked. 

I changed my diet. I eliminated raw fruits and vegetables, religiously remove the skins and seeds from everything, and prioritize soft, easy to digest foods. I also limit my fiber and fat, and strive to eat a healthy and balanced diet within these limitations. 

I reduced my nicotine consumption. I was a heavy vaper for several years, at 5%. I dropped down to 0.5% by June/July. This enabled me to eat twice as much solid food, and I suffered significantly less nausea. I eventually intend to fully quit, but doing so has been extremely difficult for me. I have another quit date planned for tomorrow...

I started on 1-2 capfuls of Miralax daily (usually 1.5 capfuls, tweaked as needed) and 20mg Pepcid twice daily, in August. This enabled me to be able to eat out again, and I have not had a gastro-related ER visit since then. It also enabled me to eat even more solid food and bigger portions. I also no longer need to take tums, like ever, anymore, and also haven't had to resort to using PPIs again. 

I started drinking coffee again. I had stopped after my diagnosis. Was told it was bad to fill my stomach with it, since it wasn't nutritious, took up space, and dehydrated me. I slowly introduced it back in, and once I've hit one cup per day, it actually seems to be helping my gastroparesis somehow. I know it definitely helps my constipation. Unsure whether it actually makes my stomach empty faster, or makes me hungrier, but either way, this is what enabled me to switch from 6 to 4 meals per day! And I'm even eating oats again. It's been huge.

And that's it. That's literally all I've done. I'm not even on a motility drug that should be directly impacting my gastric emptying but here I am. I plan to try Motegrity soon, maybe see if that will get me even more back to normal. But yeah. Things are good. Better than I honestly ever would have imagined, back in May.

Maybe I just suck tho but i prioritize cafe orders bc they be ordering like 5 dif drinks each customer with like 6 dif modifications. Its just I donr understand how yall want ur drinks on time and have so many modifications and so many drinks and food orders like its not gonna be 4 minutes i’m sorry but i’m also not sorry because I’m tired of this grandpa. Let me tell you this dude came in asking for a mocha without the coffee. So i said “so a hot chocolate?” hes like “NO a mocha without the coffee” me: “Okay so a mocha with decaf shots?” hes like “NO I DONT WANT THE COFFEE”. I rung it up as hot chocolate, he paid, and left. Im just so over it frl.",6,1763695260.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

Problem is I’m not nearly techy or patient enough to leave windows (as much as I hate windows lol) so I’m completely clueless with Linux beyond a handful of similarities with Mac like Wine and minor tinkering on my steam deck - it usually gets passed off to them lol

Does the OS have any compatibility specifications? Like can it be converted from a Chromebook or does it have to be a Windows originally, is there a minimum recommended CPU, etc etc. I don’t have a heap of money to drop on a gaming quality laptop, but my work’s been so exhausting lately that I’ve generally been a shit girlfriend and I wanna at least get a decent schooling kit together",3,1763695243.0,linux,13,1.0,False

If you have been browsing for a new couch or trying to update your living room on a reasonable budget, Burrow is one of those brands that is easy to work with. When you use my Burrow referral link, you get **$75 off your order**, which helps a bit since furniture prices always add up fast. Here is the link, [https://fbuy.io/burrow/pbj94884](https://fbuy.io/burrow/pbj94884)

Burrow makes modular sofas that come in boxes you can actually lift and move without hiring anyone. The pieces slot together, so assembly is simple, and it works well for apartments or tight spaces. You can start small and then add extra seats or a chaise later if your space changes. The cushions have a nice balanced feel, not too soft or too firm, and the fabric is designed to hold up against daily use, kids, pets, all of that.

They also carry rugs, coffee tables, shelving, and side tables that match their clean modern style. Everything they make tends to lean minimalist, so it works in a lot of home setups. One thing people like is that the furniture feels sturdy but still light enough to move around when you want to rearrange.

The $75 off is a simple way to bring the price down if you want to try Burrow but do not want to pay full price right away. If you want to use it, the link is, [https://fbuy.io/burrow/pbj94884](https://fbuy.io/burrow/pbj94884)",1,1763695149.0,DealsCouponsBargains,0,1.0,False

(p.s. no cheap syrups!),"I’ve been making my own cappuccinos for a while now, ever since I moved to an area with very few quality cafes. 

However, I’m getting a little bored with my everyday cappuccino and I’m looking for some (fairly) easy suggestions for how I can switch it up. 

I’m open to whatever, as long as it has some caffeine. Super tasty flavor add-ins I can buy or make? Perfect. Suggestions for alternative coffee or tea-based beverages? Why not. Just as long as it doesn’t triple my drink-making time. And, please, no cheap or sugar-free flavored creamers and/or syrups that get pumped out of a jug.

1p2nspv,https://i.redd.it/722j21hx2j2g1.png,"Honey, That 'Poor Employee' You Stole $300K From? IS YOUR BILLIONAIRE BOSS!","When the executives started handing out project bonuses on stage, my heart was pounding.





This was MY victory. A week of hell, $300,000 in prize money, and a promotion to Project Manager. All mine.





""Now, let's welcome Charlotte Williams to the stage to receive the project bonus. Thanks to her outstanding work, the company is promoting her to Project Manager.""





The room went dead silent.





Hundreds of eyes turned toward me—pity, sympathy, mockery—all of it crashing down on me at once, making my skin crawl.





Because they ALL knew who actually did the damn project. But they also knew the truth: nobodies like me? We get screwed. That's just how it works.





Benjamin and I weren't public. No one knew we were together.





I bit down hard, trying to keep my rage in check.





""I did this project. ALONE. There's a security camera right above my desk that recorded me working my ass off for a WEEK. And her? She sat around drinking coffee and playing games on her phone. Now she's taking MY work? MY $300,000?""





The executives barely looked at me. One of them actually rolled his eyes.





Of course. Charlotte was his precious niece. This was straight-up theft, and everyone was just... fine with it.





""YOUR project? Oh, honey. You're hilarious. A nobody like you handling a project this big? If you were that good, you'd be sitting in MY seat. Right, everyone?""





The room burst into laughter.





They were laughing AT me. Calling me stupid. Calling me worthless.





My fists clenched so tight my nails cut into my palms.





Charlotte stood up, reached into her pocket, and pulled out three hundred-dollar bills.





Then she threw them at my face.





""Emily Carter, if you're gonna try to steal credit, at least make it believable. Here. Take your sad little team out for dinner. On me.""





She stepped closer, her voice dripping with poison.





""Don't even THINK about fighting me. I'll spell it out for you—I OWN this company. Every executive here? Family. This place belongs to the Williams family. If I say I did the project, then I DID IT. End of story.""





She raised her hand and patted my cheek like I was a dog.





Swallow it. Smile. Know your place.





I slapped her hand away and glared at the executives who were all too happy to back her up.





""You ALL know I did this project. You're just letting her steal it because she's family. Fine. If you won't help me, I'll find someone who WILL.""





Charlotte's smirk grew wider. Her voice turned even more vicious.





""You? A NOBODY? Who the hell in this company would ever back YOU? You're NOTHING.""





Before she could keep going, one of her little minions jumped in.





""Exactly! You're just a pathetic employee. Who do you think you are?""





""Keep talking, and we'll make sure you NEVER work anywhere again.""





She leaned in so close I could feel her spit hitting my face as she laughed.





""That's what trash like you deserves. Spit. Because that's all you're worth.""





I kicked her square in the chest. She stumbled backward, gasping.





Then I calmly pulled out a tissue, wiped the spit off my face, and dropped it at her feet.





""You think you own this company? Newsflash—there are people WAY above your pathetic little family. And I WILL find someone who'll give me justice.""





Chapter 2





The second Charlotte heard me say I was going to find someone higher up to get justice, her smug grin vanished.





Just as I turned to leave, she shot a look at one of her lackeys. He stuck his foot out and tripped me.





The room exploded into laughter again.





""HAHAHA! What an idiot! You think you can run and tattle? Who the hell are you gonna tell?""





""You say ONE word, and I'll make sure you NEVER find work again. You'll be begging for scraps on the street, sleeping under a bridge like the trash you are.""





I clenched my jaw and got back on my feet.





If it weren't for Benjamin, I wouldn't even BE at this branch. I wouldn't have to put up with this humiliation.





""You think the Williams family runs this city? You're NOTHING. What makes you think you have the power to blacklist me from the entire industry? To make me homeless?""





The second those words left my mouth, my coworkers looked at me like I'd just signed my own death warrant.





""Does she seriously not know the Williams and Davis families control EVERYTHING in this city? Cross them, and you're done for.""





""If I were her, I'd just swallow my pride and move on. There's no winning this.""





Charlotte heard every word. And she loved it.





""Hear that, trash? You think you can report ME? How many lives do you have to throw away?""





I didn't flinch. If anything, I found her pathetic.





""This is a civilized society. Not some lawless hellhole where you can just threaten people. Use your brain for once.""





""You're so scared of me reporting you because you KNOW the truth. Once this gets investigated, everyone will find out I did the project. And all the credit went to a lazy, useless fraud like you.""





""I'll kill you, you bitch!""





I'd hit a nerve. Charlotte lunged at me, fist raised.





But this time, I was ready. I'd learned how to deal with snakes like her.





I dodged her punch easily and headed straight for the door.





""STOP HER!"" Charlotte screamed.





I bolted toward Benjamin Davis's office. He was the Vice President of the branch, overseeing all major operations.





""Benjamin, I worked my ass off on this project. Charlotte stole it. She claimed she did everything herself and took all the credit and all the money. This isn't fair. Not to me, not to any of us.""





Charlotte burst into the room right behind me, aiming a kick at my back.





I dodged again.





""Touch me one more time, and I'm calling the cops for assault.""





""Benjamin, did you SEE that? She's completely lost it. She's trying to attack me.""





Benjamin didn't say a word.





I turned to look at him, confused.





His eyes were ice-cold.





We were engaged. An arranged marriage between our families. My father sent me here to ""get to know him better.""





To hide my background—and to observe Benjamin's character—I took a low-level position at the branch.





He stood up and walked toward Charlotte.





For a split second, I thought he was going to back me up.





Instead, he reached out and gently smoothed down her messy hair.





His cold gaze melted into something soft. Tender.





That coldness? It was all for me.





My heart sank like a stone.





Chapter 3





""Benjamin, I'm your fiancée. Remember?""





The second those words left my mouth, everyone in the room—except Charlotte—froze in shock.





""WHAT? Emily Carter is Vice President Davis's fiancée?""





""No way. That's impossible. He's Benjamin Davis—powerful, wealthy, gorgeous. How could a nobody like her ever be engaged to HIM?""





""I don't buy it. She's not even worthy of being Charlotte's assistant. Look at him—he's comforting Charlotte right now. So gentle, so caring. If Emily really WAS his fiancée, why would he treat Charlotte like that and ignore Emily completely?""





The whispers reached Benjamin's ears. He turned to look at me.





""My assistant already filled me in on what happened.""





""And?""





""And the project was done by Charlotte. You're just a lazy fraud trying to steal credit.""





The room erupted.





""See? I KNEW it!""





""So Charlotte really DID do the project. Even Vice President Davis—who's always fair—says so.""





""That means Emily's been LYING this whole time. She probably just sat around pretending to work, then tried to claim she did everything herself. What a joke.""





""She's not his fiancée. She's delusional. A toad trying to eat swan meat.""





""Ugh, pathetic. She should take a good look in the mirror.""





Charlotte was glowing. Benjamin backed her up, and now everyone was turning on me.





My rage was boiling over. But at the same time, I finally understood what it meant to be powerless.





No matter where you work, if you don't have connections, there will ALWAYS be people ready to sabotage you. To steal your work. To crush you.





""Benjamin, our engagement was YOUR family's idea. The Davis family proposed it to the Carters. If you have a problem with me, just break it off.""





Benjamin's face twisted with disgust.





""Bullshit. The Davis family would NEVER propose a marriage alliance to some insignificant family like yours. And you? You're a nobody. My father wants me to marry you? Over my dead body. Give it up.""





""Fine. If that's how you feel, let's drop the engagement talk and get back to business.""





""Do you people think you're above the law? That you can just steal whatever you want and threaten whoever you want?""





""Don't you DARE accuse us of that. We never said anything like that.""

I really love both coffee and tea, and I’m fairly interested in learning about and developing my skills in both areas. I’m also interested in starting a small coffee shop/cafe at some point later in life, and I’d like to have a machine that’s comparable to what actual coffee shops, such as Starbucks, etc. use. This is something that I’d save for over time, so money wise, any budget is ok! I’m really interested in something high quality that will last me a long time, and that I can eventually use to create restaurant quality espresso beverages! It would be a huge bonus if it can be used for tea-spresso as well! 

Thank you so much!",0,1763694968.0,espresso,6,0.33,False
1p2npx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuseboxgames/comments/1p2npx8/backstory_head_canons/,Backstory & head canon’s,"I wanted to share my MC’s (Alie) personal backstory and head canon’s that I’ve created. This is the first season I’ve been enjoying since All Star’s so I felt especially inspired recently. I hope you enjoy the read and feel free to share your own on here or self-promote if you make your own post 🥰

•Childhood: Grows up with a Brazilian mom, British dad and sister who is 2 years older. Alie has a very strained relationship with her mother but is through and through a daddy’s girl. Charlie is her childhood best friend until his family moves. Alie’s father is especially keen on Charlie and sees him as the son he never had and always wanted. The night before he leaves, Charlie gifts her with a double feather necklace to remind her that she will always be guided and protected by those who love her. She grows up doing ballet and even had her eyes set on doing it professionally until she sustains an Achilles tendon rupture at 17 and is forced to hang up her pointe shoes.

•College/young adulthood: During her second year at uni, her parents get divorced due to her mom having a years-long affair. This further strains the relationship Alie has with her mother, especially when she ends up marrying the man she was having an affair with. Her father is diagnosed with terminal cancer in the middle of her junior year and sadly passes away the summer before her senior year. Alie begins to think heavily about her childhood friend Charlie and starts wearing the feather necklace again, hoping for some silent guidance and protection during this time. 

•Adulthood: Alie sees Charlie for the first time since they were kids while vacationing in Barbados. For reference, it has been about a year and a half since her father passed. She recently quit her high-paying tech job to pursue her dream of being an entrepreneur. She still heavily feels the loss of her father and also recently ended a relationship because he was cheating. Seeing Charlie is like a breath of fresh air. After their brief encounter, she doesn’t hesitate to tell her girlfriends about it. They hype her up and Alie gets a small glimmer of hope at the chance of reconnecting with an old friend. However, she’s still healing parts of her that died when her father passed and can’t fully understand the depths of her revived feelings for Charlie when the moment is in front of her. When she doesn’t see him again, she is disappointed but doesn’t feel compelled to try and reach out due to her personal circumstances. 

•Coffee Shop/Birthday Party: Alie has been busy with finalizing plans for the launch of her business. She is pleasantly surprised to run into Charlie again since Barbados 6 months prior. Deciding to go out on a limb, she invites him to her birthday party next weekend. They end their encounter with a hug and Charlie kisses her on the cheek. She tells her sister about their encounter and she is equally excited to see him again. To both of their surprise, he never shows up. Alie thinks it was probably for the best and ends up drunkenly kissing her friend named Ben. She has known Ben for a few months, sharing stolen glances and even being confirmed by a mutual friend that Ben fancies her. Then, Charlie appears at her door with a bouquet of flowers after the last person has left. The exchange is awkward and she can tell something is bothering him. She learns he has recently started seeing someone and didn’t know if it was right to come. He further reveals that he doesn’t think he can be friends with her because of the feelings he has. Alie is left stunned and Charlie abruptly leaves before she can get another word out. This moment partially fuels her decision to pursue something with Ben.

•Broken Lift: It’s been almost a year since she last saw Charlie. She’s excited to go to this opening she was invited to, but disappointed that Ben preferred to go out with a different group of friends elsewhere. They have been seeing each other on and off following her birthday party. As luck would have it, she runs into Charlie and they have another brief interaction when the lift breaks. Her feelings swell and heighten in the moment and she recklessly engages in a passionate kiss with Charlie, despite both of them knowing she has Ben. After this night, Alie comes clean to Ben about what happened and both decide to go their separate ways. She debates on reaching out to Charlie, but decides not to once she sees how much his writing career is taking off and remembers the brief comment he made about being a distraction. At the same time, she thinks about her business that has been doing extremely well and the fact her and her mom have begun trying to rebuild their relationship. Alie decides to focus on her career and family and forego pursuing any relationship for the time being. 

•On Love Island (up to Casa): Alie has been enjoying her time with Nico, despite some hiccups along the way. She didn’t expect for her feelings to be this amplified in this unique environment, but has been leaning into the experience as much as she can. Seeing Charlie at the sleepover brought a wave of emotions she hasn’t felt in a long time. But when he isn’t chosen to come back to the vila, she is immediately swept back into the pull of her budding connection with Nico. She becomes conflicted again during Casa when her and Charlie have more opportunities to speak candidly and have one-on-one time. Charlie’s patience and persistence slowly begins to unravel Alie and forces her to finally come to terms with the feelings she worked so hard to bury.

Now the question remains: Does she see things through with Nico? The man who holds his cards close to his chest but is slowly starting to let his walls down. Or will she take a risk with Charlie? The man who has undoubtedly always loved her from a distance.",5,1763694878.0,fuseboxgames,0,1.0,False

I really wanted a chocolatey/coffee fragrance, so I spent a lot of time on this subreddit yesterday looking for reviews of Fragnote's Drunken Cake and Blur's Coffee Cake. Also came across recommendations like Al-Rehab and more, but it was hard to decide based on just text descriptions. I finally caved in and decided to go to a local perfumer and asked if he had anything chocolatey. He let me smell this one bottle that honestly smelled exactly like real chocolate. I loved it, so I told him I’d buy 100 ml. I assumed he’d just pour it into a smaller bottle and that’s it.

But instead, he mixed the fragrance oil with a couple of other liquids (he mentioned something “for longevity” when I asked), shook it up, bottled it and handed it to me. When I asked about top/heart/base notes he kind of blanked and just said “no ma’am, only chocolate.” So now I’m wondering… what exactly did he mix, and does this fresh mixture need time to settle?

I’ve seen people say maceration can take weeks or even months, but that sounds extreme for what I got. Right now, it smells a bit alcohol-heavy compared to what I smelled in the big jar, so I’m guessing it needs to rest, but I don’t know for how long.

How long should I let a freshly mixed perfume like this macerate? And will it end up smelling different from the original scent I liked?

Would love to hear your experience if you’ve bought from local perfumers or oil houses before. I’m still learning.",4,1763694755.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,7,1.0,False
1p2nno4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomAI/comments/1p2nno4/what_is_aim_of_life/,what is aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p2nmpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanFranciscoWeddings/comments/1p2nmpi/looking_for_affordable_forest_garden_greenhouse/,Looking for affordable forest / garden / greenhouse wedding venue near Bay Area / Sacramento / NorCal for May 2026 (3–5k venue budget),"My fiancée and I are starting to plan our wedding for May 2026, and I’m hoping some NorCal people can help with venue ideas and general tips.

We live in Sacramento, but we’re mainly looking for something in the Bay Area with nice nature vibes. At the same time, places that are closer to Sacramento are totally on the table too, like Lake Tahoe, Placer County (Auburn / Loomis / Newcastle), Davis, Woodland, El Dorado County and similar areas. Roughly, anything within about 2 hours of Sac works.

What we’d really love is a spot where we can do both the ceremony and reception in one place, with a forest, garden, greenhouse, or overall nature feel. It will be an Anglican wedding with a simple liturgical ceremony, nothing super over the top. We are planning for a pretty small guest count, around 45–50 people, so it does not have to be huge. Our budget for the venue rental itself is around 3–5k.

One extra layer that makes this a little more specific: our families are Russian / Slavic. We’re planning to bring in Slavic food catering, a Russian speaking coffee cart, and a DJ who can do both Russian and American music. Because of that, we really need a venue that is flexible about vendors and does not lock us into a strict in house or preferred vendor list. Ideally something that allows outside catering, lets us bring our own DJ, and is fine with an outside coffee cart.

So I’m looking for any venues that roughly fit this description: within a couple hours of Sacramento (Bay Area or the closer towns I mentioned), 3–5k for the rental, forest or garden or greenhouse aesthetic, and friendly to outside vendors including ethnic catering.

If you have done a wedding like this in NorCal, or know friends who have, I’d really appreciate:

* Names of venues you liked that might fit
* Rough idea of what you paid for the venue
* Any “gotchas” in the contract, like noise curfews, required vendors, corkage fees, or surprise charges

I’m also totally open to less traditional venues that still look nice in photos, like retreat centers, churches with beautiful grounds, community halls with gardens, parks where both ceremony and reception are allowed, etc.

If you pulled off a similar budget wedding around here, please tell me where you did it and how you kept costs reasonable. Links to venues or photo galleries would be amazing so I can show them to my fiancée.

This gets a little whiny but honestly I'm at my wits' end. I just want my monitor to monitor. It refuses. 

So: I have a new **MacBook Air**. I am trying to use it with a new **ASUS PA278CGV** monitor. And everything is going so *very* wrong that it's probably a really simple thing that everyone knows to do except me. 

Now I have a deadline, and it's *finally* doing a thing I simply cannot find a workaround for. Help? 

**Part 1 of the problem** \- when I wake up my machine from sleep, the monitor doesn't wake up. This is the case whether it's HDMI'd in or USB-C'd in. I need to physically reach around the back and toggle the on/off switch. (*Solving just this part would save my ergonomics, not to mention my sanity*.)

  
**Part 2 of the problem** \- The toggle is annoying, but the real issue comes next: I turn the monitor back on... and **it shows up as a new,** ***second*** **external monitor** in my machine's System Settings.   
See image below - I have only 1 ext. monitor. One. Uno. There should not be a (2). It does not exist.

I can't seem to delete, ""forget,"" or otw get rid of display (2).

  
(As you can guess from this image, I've already tried re-arranging my real ext. display and the non-real ext. display. It does not fix the problem... or the *next* problem I'm about to share.)

https://preview.redd.it/ygopahasvi2g1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=f49395dcf70d6861cc6772821556a8a3bb484fc0



**Part 3 (final!) part of the problem** \- monitor (2) doesn't actually exist... *but my machine thinks it does.* And it sends some of my open windows there. To a monitor. That doesn't exist. 

So I can't find or use those windows. They're on a monitor that doesn't exist. (*By now, I'm quietly weeping into my canned espresso that's supposed to get me through this deadline.)*

**The only way I've found to get all windows back** is by disconnecting the monitor entirely, which brings all open windows back onto my machine's built-in screen. 

Then I reconnect my (1) external monitor. PA278CGV arrives on the scene! Then I step away to make coffee, or do anything, really. 

My machine sleeps. I wake it up. Monitor doesn't wake up. I toggle its manual on/off switch. BOOM. I have 2 monitors again: PA278CGV (1) and PA278CGV (2). 

I hope someone can tell me the dead-simple thing I am screwing up, or the known incompatibility that will let me give up on this monitor in peace.  I am losing my tiny little mind.

And honestly, I feel like I’m slowly losing myself in this house.

A bit of backstory:

My grandfather never worked because of a lung condition when he was young. He’s healthy now but has spent most of his life doing nothing—coffee in the morning, flirting around in the afternoon. His older brother in the US sends him money every month, and my grandmother endured decades of his gambling and cheating.

When I was in first grade, he lost so much money gambling that he wanted to sell the house my grandparents shared. My grandmother didn’t agree, so he forced a divorce. My mother also encouraged him to divorce at the time, which made me hate both of them for a while.

My mom eventually divorced my dad too—partly because the relationship broke down, partly because she caught feelings for someone else. She then started an affair with a married man who works at a hair salon. She got caught once, the man’s wife threatened to expose private photos, and my mom ended up filing a complaint that caused the wife to “lose” the case.  
Despite all that, my mom is *still* secretly seeing the guy.

So yeah… I’m living with two people whose moral compass points in directions I don’t understand.

Today something stupid happened that made everything explode.  
My younger sibling brought home free food from my dad’s place but didn’t ask if I wanted any—even though this has happened many times. I got upset at him, but my mom came home from work, heard us arguing, and immediately assumed I was mad at *her*. She stormed in, yelling, and told me to get out of the house.

I snapped and said, “If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even have this house. This house is mine.” - screaming like an idiots  
Then I walked upstairs. She stood downstairs shouting that I was disrespectful. My grandfather just stared at me like he hated me.

Now the house is dead silent,.  
I also feel guilty, disgusted, resentful… all at the same time.

I don’t want to become a bitter person.  
I don’t want to hate my own family.  
But living with them makes me feel like I’m suffocating.

All of that and more has made it harder to find anyone nearby who shares my interests. So I figured I might as well see who is out there on Reddit.

As a general disclaimer, I am not looking to make a bunch of friends. I’d honestly even be happy just finding one person I connect with. 

Now with the generalities aside, let’s get a little bit more specific… 

A little about me. I lean pretty alternative, have a handful of piercings, no tattoos yet, and I fall somewhere in the genderqueer, androgynous area of things.

As for music, I usually drift toward shoegaze, dream pop, indie, folk, jazz, and other alternative stuff. A few favorites are Ethel Cain, Nothing, Whirr, Slow Crush, Cigarettes After S*x, Sufjan Stevens, and Chelsea Days for a few.

I really love reading literary fiction. Genre fiction has never clicked for me. (Sorry sci-fi lovers, I just can’t get into it). I am more drawn to writing that dives deep into the human experience in strange or interesting ways. Think Joy Williams, Raymond Carver, or Clarice Lispector. I especially love short story collections and often read those when I’m out on a hammock or up early drinking coffee.

Outside of reading and writing, I have been trying to get back into knitting, making music, and painting. It’s been a while, but I miss having creative outlets.

I was also very into philosophy club in college, so I am always down to wander into long conversations about whatever strange or thoughtful idea comes up.

I would love to meet someone with similar interests who enjoys deep talks and would maybe be open to hanging out one day. Late night coffee, a smoke, hiking at state parks, and conversations about life sound pretty ideal to me. I am not looking for quick or temporary friendships. I want something genuine.

If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to send me a message. Hopefully we’ll connect!",3,1763694250.0,friendship,2,1.0,False

If you’re into tea that actually tastes like someone cared when they made it, the Art of Tea $20 Off coupon is a nice little perk. The link is super simple, nothing weird, just this one here, [http://rwrd.io/lpdql82?c](http://rwrd.io/lpdql82?c), and it knocks $20 off your first order. Honestly Art of Tea is one of those brands where even the sample packs feel fancy. I got hooked on their loose leaf blends because they don’t have that dusty vibe you get from grocery teas.

What I really like is how easy it is to experiment without committing to a giant bag. They have sampler kits, seasonal blends, wellness teas, and the packaging is cool enough that you can toss it in a gift box and pretend you thought way ahead this year. About 2/3 in I should probbly mention that shipping comes fast and the stuff stays fresh, even the herbal blends that usually die out quick.

The $20 off deal works on your first purchase, no hidden hoops, and it stacks nicely with whatever small promo they run on the site sometimes. If you’re the type who makes a nighttime tea before bed or if you’re trying to cut down on coffee shakes, this is an easy upgrade without paying full price. Give it a look, grab something new, and enjoy having tea that actually tastes like tea instead of warm leaf water.",1,1763694202.0,ReferralTrains,0,1.0,False

1p2ngrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1p2ngrk/betrayed_by_a_friend_i_helped/,Betrayed by a friend I helped.,"Bear with me it's a long story.

I'll avoid names and details for obvious reasons,  but I have (or had not sure yet) a friend of 6 years, who just got a horrible divorce about a year ago, her ex-husband husband did something horrible that still boils me to this day, my friend after the divorce lost temporarily custody of her 5 kids but they managed to stay with family so in all not that horrible there at least, she became extremely depressed, almost all her friends turned their back on her by telling her that why didn't she noticed first and such (horrible assholes). Seeing this and me knowing all that transpired I just couldn't just stand back, so I offered my help in everything I could, talks till 2 - 4 am, cooking, offering advice and support, etc. 

Fast forward 8 months after and we're talking more often and going out for coffee as she's finally starting to come out of the shell but still sensitive on a few days a week, so one day she decided to tell me that she's had a crush on me but never did anything out of fear of loosing my friendship, I won't lie I was expecting that at some point as I was starting to consider it also, but it wasn't the right thing to do, not while she was still recovering from the trauma of the divorce and all that entailed, so I told her: 

""You're an amazing woman, I won't lie I've thought about it more than once also, but I don't want to take advantage of you while you're still healing, I want you to focus on your kids for now and yourself, if in a month or two or whenever you feel ready, and you feel the same then ask me again and we'll go out and see where it leads""


 I do love her, and I realize that this was probably a stupid thing to do but I do have my reservations for being with people specially when kids are involved. 

When I was younger before I met her my girlfriend/partner of the time got pregnant, I was happy and ready to start a family, but she was scared or it looked like that to me, and she told me she wasn't ready, she was almost 3 months pregnant when we realized, so I told her that I understood that I wasn't going to force her even if I was ready and wanted it because she was the one carrying our daughter, so she aborted...
Our relationship never recovered, after a while one of her friends suggested to her that she should erase me from her life and she agreed, when she told me I was just numb and I just let her do as she wanted.

A year and a half later I see her in a city festival and she's with the ""friend"" that suggested she erased me from her life, and they're pushing a baby stroller... 

So now with my friend who I helped through her divorce and trauma, 3 weeks ago she calls me and  starts texting me how she got introduced to someone, that a friend insisted, well according to her, the guy is exactly like me. 
""He's like you, he has the same sense of humor and manners, he says the same jokes and behaves the same, it's like you but Asian"" and such she tells me after she met him and they start texting. 

They go out for a date and she asks me to babysit her kids, I accept and I don't think too much about it as she told me it's just as friends, and during her date she says the same thing to me how he's just like me... They end up sleeping together the same night, and she tells me about it the same night when she picks up her kids as we talk in private so they don't hear, I play along and say that I'm happy for her that she had fun even if I'm dying on the inside, the worse part is that she tells me again at the end ""he's really just like you, but for some reason I feel bad"" .... 

We're supposed to talk soon, she knows my past and how my ex aborted my daughter, but she doesn't know the full context of it, well that's my story, I do blame myself for not being more assertive but I can't help it, and I thought she understood that after knowing me for 6 years... 

Well that's my story, fucked up and pathetic I know. ",3,1763694146.0,Diary,2,1.0,False

City analysis says our water total hardness is 2 grains (35ppm) and I use tap water filtered through a standard Brita pitcher water filter. Brew espresso and steam milk almost exclusively.  I see people using distilled water and adding mineral packets. Would bumping the total water hardness from 35ppm to 50 make a difference in taste that would be noticeable?

What are people using to take these kind of measurements? The 35ppm total hardness is from our city water department. I do know that we don't get much scale buildup. My 2 Silvia's (poor man's double boiler machine) have been used daily for a long time (decades) and are running great.

We knew of each others existence for a year but we started talking on a dating app late August. It started very casual. We flirted with each other a lot and at that point I just thought it’s going to be a casual thing. We met up in person, talked a lot, vibed well, and made out. We continued talking and met a second time and that’s when we had sex.

Now here’s the thing, we continued talking to a point where I started getting confused if it’s even casual anymore. As of right now, we’ve been talking for a total of 90 days. We often see each other, at least once a week since we’re both busy. Sometimes, it’s just to talk to each other and watch a movie together, and sometimes it’s just for sex. And I really really like him. We have great conversations and we get along so well. I definitely want him for more than just fooling around. I did ask him what he was looking for about 2 months ago and he said “I don’t know! I got dumped last December and I’m still figuring stuff out! Plus my future is very uncertain since idk where I’ll be getting a job and in what state since I graduated last summer. If I date someone, I wanna give them full of myself and not just half of myself.” I am still in college (we both went to the same one) and I just saw whatever he said as “let’s keep things casual.” And I was fine with it until he started being more lovey dobey and we started meeting on campus at random times to get coffee together.

He had to go to California recently for 5 days, and I told him how I wanna see him before he leaves. He couldn’t see me a day before he left because he was busy but he texted me back that night saying “I’m sorry, I give you permission to double text me or call me if I’m not answering back cuz my phone is always on silent and I’m usually busy doing lab work all day! But I’ll make time for you tomorrow before I leave so we can get coffee together! And please let me pay for your coffee.” We met for coffee, had a good conversation, and he gave me a peck in front of lab mates before I dropped him off, telling me how he’s gonna see me once he’s back.

Think bohemian vibe with comfortable seating, rugs, hippie decor, performance stage, coffee and a full cannabis bar with smoke sesh service. Similar to Cirrus that opened recently, I want to have on-site sales but a little more casual. Jazz nights, vinyl record dj, pool tables, I want the place to be a homey space for friends to relax after work or enjoy a night out alcohol free. Without giving away too many details , I have lots of great ideas I want to implement.

Now that you have an understanding of what the business is, I’m looking for any information that the people would like to give me. 

Does Denver want something like this?

I haven’t been able to find a lounge around the country that provides the vibe I want to create alongside on-site sales (most are bring your own cannabis). Something like this could be years in the making but I think as legalization opens up more , these businesses will start popping up quick.

It was built in 1938 and had the handyman special. We went ahead and rewired our kitchen with plans to continue on with the rest of the house. One outlet in our kitchen was problematic and attached to the dishwasher and it would trip the breaker all the time so that’s why we started in the kitchen. The company we hired came out and rewired the kitchen and set the dishwasher up on its own circuit. So the troublesome outlet is on its own, not attached to any other outlet, nothing. All was well for like a year then all the sudden the breaker started tripping again. Guys came back out because warranty and said everything looks good, checked everything over, and changed our breaker, thinking it was faulty. It’s a GFCI breaker. They left and said to call them back if it trips 3 more times and to write down date, time, and what was plugged in when it happened. So after the new year its does it again. It did it with the coffee maker by itself once and twice with coffee maker and air fryer plugged in. They came back out and ran some tests, decided to be cautious and rewired again, new GFCI breaker, new outlet. They said if it trips again it’s my appliances. Surprise, surprise it’s still tripping. New coffee maker and no air fryer anymore. I don’t know what to do. They won’t come again and I understand that. Is the GFCI  breaker super sensitive? What could it be? Should I get a different company out? The previous company rewired our garage and put a breaker box out there and we’ve had absolutely no issues out there. Does anyone here have any ideas… thank you.

After a tree fell on our house in 2023, my partner and I ended up having our tiled shower rebuilt from scratch. The tile installation was completed at least two weeks before we moved back into the house and started using the shower, and it looked fantastic. A week into using the shower, I noticed that the grout around the drain was stained and then basically washed away when I tried to clean it (turns out it was getting stained by drain pipe rust, but I could not find an explanation for its impermanence). That let me to inspect the rest of the grout, and we discovered 20+ holes/gaps in the wall grout that had eroded away in the short time we had been using it. The contractor claimed this was normal (and maybe it is?) and that he would return as often as needed to repair the holes, and we eventually did three rounds of these repairs over the following year.

After the first round of repairs, I noticed that I could run my fingernail or even a wet paper towel down the grout, and a significant amount would come off. The contractor insisted that this was normal because the grout was new and would eventually stop once the ""leftover dust"" all washed down the drain, but it did not, and when I pointed that out, I was told that I should have sealed the grout (we later brought in a grout rep and verified that the grout that was used did NOT need to be sealed), among a dozen other excuses that included the summer heat on the exterior wall ""bringing bubbles to the surface"", the glass penny tiles on the shower floor heating up is affecting the grout, or my favorite: we had been drinking coffee in the shower and that's what caused the rust-colored drain stains. I had to fight for a year to get our contractor to agree to replace it.

I've gotten no official explanation for what went wrong, but I suspect there was too much water added to the grout, so it didn't harden as much as it should have.

Today was finally the day to start that replacement. We were told that an employee would come and remove the grout today, and the owner would replace it the next day. It's important to note that during the assessment, the owner had decided to switch brands and style of grout for the replacement: from Laticrete sanded grout to Custom Building Products Polyblend non-sanded grout. His employee just finished his part of ""removing"" the old grout, but when I inspected it, it is genuinely difficult from a layperson standpoint to tell if the grout is actually removed and ready for a new and different grout. So my questions are:

\- Do these photos look like the grout has been properly removed (we were NOT told that ""removing"" grout actually leaves some behind, so we don't know if this is normal)?

\- Will overlaying non-sanded grout over what's the left of the sanded grout cause any integrity issues?

All I want is for our grout to be a strong as it should be so that I'm not paying to replace it again a few years down the road. Thank you so much for your input.",2,1763692386.0,Tile,3,1.0,False

Hello! I'm searching or a skilled (mediocre+, 2 years minimum) animator for an anime-inspired Soccer game created in Unreal Engine 5.4.2. We're searching for a candidate who's preferably very familiar with soccer/football and who's also familiar with soccer anime, especially Blue Lock.

**Payment Information**

We want to offer a paid opportunity through milestones, formatted in a way to build trust. For example, we have 5 milestones each ranging from $500 to $600. Each milestone has roughly 5 to 6 animations requested. For each new milestone, we'll pay half the amount up-front, then the other half after the work is completed. We'll provide our own IK Character Rig you can make adjustments to as you wish, but please keep the skeleton structure intact. The RevShare portion from the title comes from after we're finished with the 5 milestones. I'm willing to offer no more than 5% RevShare as you'll likely become a foundational animator for the game development team if you wish to continue on this project. You'll be paid through PayPal. The first payment for the first milestone will come as soon as you and I both sign a Statement of Work, an Independent Contractor Agreement, and of course an NDA.

**Current Progress**

For the game, we currently have:

* Basic WASD movement, walking and sprinting
* Stamina System, with rechargable items players can pick up
* Curve-shots, with a custom mechanic not seen in other Soccer/Football games
* Passing, with a custom solution for short lobs and long lobs
* Receiving, with basic Traps and Flicks implemented
* IK Character Rig
* Custom shaders, achieving a Ghibili-like grass system and anime-like character outlines
* A discord server with about 20 people so far wanting to participate in alpha and beta play tests
* And of course, a lot of design documents for the core pillars of our game design strategy, multiplayer networking, and other systems.

**My Previous Work**

I've completed two games in the past on a much, much smaller scale. You're welcome to ask me about them. They're basic platformer games and a small coffee shop game published on Steam.

**Contact Information**

Please message me on discord: itstomtom321. When you first message me, please answer these basic screening questions. I will most likely not respond if you don't.

* What timezone are you in?
* Do you watch and/or enjoy watching soccer?
* Are there any soccer anime you watch?
* Do you have an animation portfolio I can review? If so, please send it. Videos (instead of websites) work fine as well.",2,1763692281.0,INAT,0,1.0,False

1. Specialty (B&W, George Howell, two local roasters and a Fellow Drop once a month) that I grind with an Ode 2 brew with third wave through a V60 and enjoy on slower mornings and weekends  

2. Coffee from Costco (whatever isn’t Kirkland or Starbucks brand) brewed with tap water through the Moccamaster on days I go into the office or get up early. 


After a long stretch of delicious pour overs with specialty coffees my Moccamaster brews have been tasting like burnt ashtrays.  I ran some George Howell Dota through the Moccamaster and it was… good.  I miss the clarity and acidity of the V60 but it was much more enjoyable than the dark roasts that I used to love.  

All that being said, how can I optimize the Moccamaster for lighter washed and natural coffees?  I think water is the first step.  I’ll try a gallon of third wave light roast moving forward.  I’m using a 16:1 ratio and grind around 7 on the Ode 2 (where I’d be at 3 for pourover) with no stirring, blooming, etc.

**Gayoon -**

Sorry Dohee, 

You have nothing going on so there isn’t even anything to diss 

This show is Unpretty, so why didn’t you want to join? 

This was for you but you can’t even take what’s given 

Your words, lyrics, English, can’t do anything alone without ChatGPT

You should also ask GPT to write your diss rap lyrics as well, come on

GPT will reply, 

What? 

\[Its Kwon Dohee’s loss\]

Everyone avoids you during team select, your entire existence is boring

In terms of skills I’m the professor, you’re a trainee 

Beating you is easy, this is a sample taste of the acerbity for you 

Because of me Kwon Dohee will fall into danger, want to escape but I’m above

You should really cut it with the rapper esteem 

If you were that good, you’d have risen to fame already 

Dohee can’t drink coffee anymore, she can’t sleep after losing to me

Others aren’t interested in you, they skip hers and all her views are from her acquaintances 

Someone like you is a dime and a dozen, like chicken restaurant advertisements near the Han river 

Every verse is same Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V, so I have no choice but to press on you delete 

Delete

Delete

Dohee, Dohee, You’re on TV! 

There, the camera, 1, 2, 3, smile\~

That was the thumbnail 

*(Dohee says that she couldn’t understand Gayoon and her diction was bad)*  
*(Personally, I think it was good and I could understand her clearly without subtitles)*

**Dohee -** 

Welcome actor Choi!

Actor Choi, for today I request yet another charismatic glaring act

Starring diss in shoooot 

Originally a film and theater major Gayoon, I think she’s talented in acting

*(Missed the beat)*

Acting like she’s charismatic, acting like she’s good at rap, our know-it-all Gayoonie

Should’ve been a musical ensemble member instead, there’s no place for you here 

Want me to make you a role? 

Here! A script\~

Told to rap but put on a anger act, wak wak wak wak

Can’t hear what you’re saying, fix that habit of just yelling I’m 

Oh Eun Young

*(A child behavioral psychologist and a TV personality)* 

Sit down, good job, calm down, you’re so mad I can’t hear your diction 

Unnie will evaluate your skill for you this is audition 

You still don’t know? Your skills are embarrassing 

Hmm, no matter how hard you try second place among the red heads 

Hmm, after bleaching your hair you’re just Sujin’s shadow in the end

*(Sujin's image is held up)*

*(Gayoon lost to Sujin in 1v1)*

That’s your place, face red ashamed is only Gayoonie 

Our Gayoonie who can’t write lyrics alone, don’t cry, 

There’s a rumor, Choi Gayoon can’t escape YSY’s rap lessons

Even with a ghost writer she can’t deliver, to be faced with me is a bad choice

You need it, an objective view

I’ll confirm it, the difference between me and you 

Your stomach hurts from inferiority complex

What ever I do I shine 

*(They both seem to rap things about each other on that the audience isn’t aware of, since they’re roommates/friends)* 

*(Niko remarks that Dohee’s rhythm is off)*

*(YSY remarks that she wished Dohee didn’t miss her beats)* 

**Youmin vs Koko**

**Youmin -** 

Koko unnie\~

Heard this is your second attempt at ‘princess’

But you still don’t know? Who the Princess is? 

Hey Koko the little girl with black hair

Oh, sorry, you’re not a little girl anymore 

Isn’t it too late for you? I’m still a high schooler 

It’s alright for you to give up 

*(Referring to how Koko’s having a hard time debuting due to her age, 21, which is considered old in the idol industry)* 

Is ‘Princess’ still your dream? You really think you could be her? 

Let’s ask everyone, ‘Who is Princess’? 

(Koko failed to debut in a survival show called Who is Princess before) 

She’s an anime otaku that she thinks she’s the protagonist

But in real life no presence no name like the black criminal 

*(raises up a upside down image of the criminal from Detective Conan)*

*(Detective Conan reference)* 

Go home and sleep shh Good Night 

*(Pun on her name, infantilizing connotations)* 

Instead of listening to unnie’s boring rap I’d rather look in the mirror and play muk-jji-ppa

*(Variation of rock paper scissors)*

Rock paper scissors

Rock paper scissors

More fun than Koko’s rap 

Rock paper scissors 

Oh no\~

Are you ok? 

*(Koko comments that there were a lot of moments where she couldn’t understand Youmin’s Japanese)* 

*(YSY says it might have been better for a Japanese contestant to be there instead)* 

*(Youmin can’t speak Japanese and she only chose to be in the Japan 1v1 because she can’t dance due to her leg injury and the other Japanese girls wanted to do dance)* 

**Koko -** 

Youmin, I can’t even think of an idea to diss you with

Because you lack impact 

*(Koko was criticized before for lacking impact)*

Do you wanna be me?

Then show me, uh, you can’t copy me 

Flow that no one has seen before, can you keep up with this maze?

I’ll show you my skill, my unwavering style

The best, the finest, most ideal, the greatest

*(cool alliteration moment)*

Even if it looks similar, it’s a different class, show me what you can do for once

Let’s ask who can do better, even your fans will side with me 

When talking about anime your eyes are bright

But you shiver and mumble when you rap 

Doesn’t makes sense to lose to the worst 

I’ll show you, domain expansion 

*(Jujitsu Kaisen reference)* 

Unified, everyone claps

Even with no primetime youth, right now I’m the ACE

Can’t find sense in your rap 

Go play around there with your rap

Is there anything Youmin knows how to do? 

Hip-hop k-pop she’s bad at both 

You should’ve been good at least one, it’s game over, go home already 

**Niko Seoyoung VS Heeyeon Chaerin**

**Niko & Seoyoung -** 

For you just pass

Hello MC Racoon

*(Heeyeon’s representative animal is a racoon)* 

I heard it’s your dream to rap well? 

MC Racoon should I give you these glasses? 

Even with those, you can’t be like me 

Whatever you do, you’re just like a nerd

Late puberty, wake up from your dream I’ll evaluate you 

Your skills are school club level 

Heeyeonie wants the spot next to us, but there’s nothing she can do because she can’t rap 

Who are you to face with us? 

A little puppy who doesn’t know to fear a tiger

*(reference to Seoyoung’s lyrics against Niko in 1v1)* 

We eat Neoguri up in one bite 

*(Neoguri is racoon/Korean ramen brand)*

Slurp slurp 

Hot tears down Heeyeonie’s eyes 

Drip drip 

*(video clip of Heeyeon saying that she'll have to teach something to other contestants)*

She thinks she’s Unnie?! 

Heeyeon, should this Unnie teach you something? 

Only thing Heeyeon can brag about is getting accepted to S-University 

*(Heeyeon goes to Seoul University)* 

Add one to the list, being against me today is your second

The mic looks off in your hands, just stick to pencils like you’ve always done 

What? You wanna be a rapstar? Then sure, copy as I do

MC Raccoon?

No, this kid’s a frog in a well 

*(reference to an old proverb about a frog living in a small well who believe the small wells the entire world, used to describe a person with a limited perspective of the world)* 

MC Raccoon?

No, this kid’s a frog in a well 

Ribbit 

MC Raccoon?

No, this kid’s a frog in a well 

Say what? 

MC Raccoon?

No, this kid’s a frog in a well 

What? 

Oh! Unnie, what about Chaerinie? 

Oh that's right!

Shouldn’t Chaerin also get a verse? 

Don’t know (her), don’t know (her)

*(Heeyeon comments that it’s just another Niko & Seoyoung performance)*

*(Chaerin says she’s chilling because she received no attacks)*

**Heeyeon & Chaerin -** 

*(Heeyeon puts on Seoul University jacket)* 

Heeyeon Unnie! I want to do rap!

Really? I’m so proud of you!

But wait, if you are going to be like them, you’re going to fail!

6 years as a trainee, Niko and Seoyoung 

*(they both were trainees for a long time)*

What's the use in enduring? Even their company abandons them 

Chaerin, remember, even giving up early is bravery, look at those two, standing there wasting their years 

I got into Seoul University at 18, for you two with a dark future ahead this Unnie will tutor you 

8x6? 

(...)

7x9

(94?)

You seem to have a lot of strange clothes, but have you seen these? 

*(referring to her Seoul University jacket)* 

Seoyoung Unnie\~

Must have been frustrating to endure the time in the basement 

Got out to see light at this Survival Show, but even then you’re just pretending to be a queen 

Unnie must have wanted to be taller, even your heels aren’t enough that you had to use a chair

Get a reality check 

*(referring to when Seoyoung’s danced on a chair)*

*(Seoyoung is 5’0 and the smallest in this show)*

Niko your frugality is clear to see, because you want to save money on shampoo it's been a whole month of you wearing those braids   

You’re good at dance, rap, and everything 

So how did you still not debut yet?

Niko, do you want to go home after 6 years of training? Huh? Back to Japan? 

To get carried away on stage like a chihuahua that met your eyes, is it ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

*(Seoyoung referred to herself as a chihuahua in her about me paper)* 

To have a one-man show stage in a team and be the only one that stands out, is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

To only have one single out while being called an artist, is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

To get on the show and just be sitting while playing as a character, is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

Is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

Is that ok or not ok? NOT! O! K!

It's never ok, Chaerin, you got that right? 

Yes! I understand Unnie!

**Yuju VS Yunon**

**Yuju -** 

Everyone, everyone,

This is a 17 year old friend name Yunon

Doesn’t have much presence, but she’s ok to watch 

Please take good care of her\~

You know, Yunon? No one knows who you are 

You know Yunon? No one notices your presence without me

Producers! I have a question! Why did you pick her? She lowers the standards (of the show)

A prey left out for Yuju is You, 

Just enjoy it this is the only change you’re going to get

Who remembers? What was your name again? 

Ah that’s right, 

The one who lost to Yuju!

Your diss rap lyrics are so predictable, “ForTh sUrVivaL sHoW”

*(this is Yuju’s fourth survival show)* 

Three times of failure? No. 

Three times the growth. The fourth time will testify 

As your senior I will let you know,

You’re not good. 

Hey, who’s cuter? 

Of course, Yuju’s cuter 

Go back to your home in To. k. yo

Eliminated must leave, go this road

*(reference to Yunon’s cypher)* 

This is my autograph, you should take it and go brag about it 

*(Seohyun rips paper)*

Yunon - 

Hello! 

This is Nam Yuju featuring at yet *another* survival show!

Audition, audition, audition, audition, 

*(Yunon team holds up contestant images of Juju's 3 Mnet survival shows and a drawing of one non-Mnet survival show)*

The burning gaze of everyone looking at Yuju 

Think of your past, Izna

Yuju’s debut confirmed, is not 

*(Yuju was in a survival show that debuted Izna)*

On this ring is David and Goliath, even if the difference is huge everyone knows

People watching say Yunon is the underdog, just as they say I’ll bite your throat 

Like this, even after 50 years, you’d be on your 54th survival show 

Who’s side would you look the best next to? You’ll never be main, your life forever a side character 

Fourth time!

Fourth time!

Nam Yuju’s re-re-re-try 

Fourth time!

Fourth time!

The good: thumb keys are a revelation, Home Row Mods ftw, and QMK is awesome. The bad: the learning curve is brutal, the mental overhead for coding is exhausting, and the build quality is aggressively just okay. While I'm happily returning to my 60% boards, the Planck was an invaluable, if occasionally infuriating, teacher that gave me the skills I was after.

# Why would you do this to yourself? What's the point?

I got these questions a lot in various forms. And they are fair, to be honest. I frequently looked down at the Planck and asked myself the very same questions.

Some of you are already deep into this hobby and already use keyboards that most people would consider unusable abominations. You already get it. Those who aren't/don't... this review is for you.

There *are* reasons, but to understand them, we first need to start thinking about keyboards a bit differently. Let's begin by stepping down to 60% and slaying a sacred cow: the arrow keys.

# Fuck Arrow Keys

That's right, I said it. Go ahead: gasp, boo, hiss, clutch your fucking pearls.

To be clear, this isn't about *not having or using navigation features*: we all need to move the cursor around somehow. What you don't need are *dedicated* arrow keys.

Many of you are sitting in front of a standard full-size or TKL keyboard right now. These are very straightforward: if you want F5, you reach up and press the F5 key; if you want Print Screen, you reach over and press the Print Screen key. If you want the cursor to move up a line, you reach over and press the ↑ key. Easy peasy.

Here's a new way of thinking about this, though: all that reaching around the keyboard for different keys isn't just inefficient, it's poor ergonomics. What if the most critical functions were always right under your fingers on the home row?

Stop reaching and start chording.

This isn't groundbreaking: cut, copy, and paste are indispensable features that have never had dedicated keys on any standardized modern layout. You don't reach across the keyboard for a key, you *chord* Ctrl (or Cmd) + X, C, or V. Your fingers never leave the 40% portion of the keyboard. We're just applying that same logic to the arrow keys.

This principle isn't even new. Gamers discovered this decades ago with the rise of first-person shooters and keyboard-mouse controls: you need your right hand on the mouse for aiming, but the arrow keys are *also* on the right. The solution was `WASD` as arrows. By moving navigation to the left hand's home position, they freed up the right hand for the mouse. While our goal isn't landing headshots, the core lesson is the same: putting essential navigation in a comfortable position under your fingers instead of chasing dedicated keys across the board is a massive win for efficiency. We're just applying that battle-tested wisdom to everyday typing.

Next, take a look at your Caps Lock key: it's a useless little bitch taking up prime home row real estate. With the magic of programmable mechanical keyboards, we can transform it into a key that opens up a layer with things like Enter, Backspace, Delete, and yes, even arrow keys, all right on the home row. You don't even need to buy a new keyboard to experiment with this: all you need is access to VIA or Vial.

This advice isn't for everyone, of course. Some people don't want any challenge at all from their keyboard, just something nice to type on. That's fine. For those of us willing to experiment, yes, it takes a little elbow grease to get there. Yes, it takes some retraining of your muscle memory... but for serious typists, the payoff can be significant. And fun to configure!

# The Keyboard Dark Arts

I'm a 60% user at heart. That's my sweet spot. The thought of using anything smaller as a daily driver is extremely unappealing, to put it nicely: I write a fair amount of code, and I need easy access to numbers and symbols. At the same time, I don't need anything larger. I appreciate the more compact form factor and the extra desk space, and (as you can probably tell) I vastly prefer home row navigation to dedicated arrow keys. A 60% keyboard has all the keys I need and none that I don't.

So why did I buy a 40% keyboard? An ortholinear one, no less? No, seriously, why the fuck would someone who writes code buy a keyboard that doesn't have dedicated keys for numbers or critical symbols like `\`, -, =, \[, \], \`?

To the wider world, where to find the ""missing"" keys on a 60% layout is a solved problem with several freely available solutions. Take the HHKB-style arrow keys `[;'/`, accessed via a Function key made from splitting right Shift. This ""solution"" always felt hacky to me (see what I did there?). It forces an awkward reach for the pinky to anchor on the Fn key, then requires you to pivot your hand to hit the arrows. Need Page Up? That's an even deeper, more strained reach, all while your pinky is held hostage.

If your goal is saving desk space or achieving a certain aesthetic, that may be a workable solution; but if the goal is maximizing speed and ergonomics, this ain't it.

I (and many others) figured that a better solution was hiding in plain sight on the *other side of the board*: the prime, underutilized real estate of the dumbfuck Caps Lock key. By turning it into a layer key instead, I could get true home-row navigation with `IJKL` with no pinky strain. That simple idea quickly snowballed. I pulled in other essentials like Backspace, Delete, Enter, and modifiers to where I could reach with my left hand, building an entire layer that was not just a workaround for missing keys, but a genuine ergonomic upgrade over the standard positions of many keys I *did* have. I almost never, for example, use my Backspace key anymore: Caps Lock + `d` for Backspace is faster and more ergonomic.

My setup was good, but I was stuck in a rut. I knew it could be better. I wanted my home row to do more, but I had also reached the limits of my knowledge and capacity with the Vial software.

To get to the next level, I needed to go back to school. I saw the Planck as a ticket out of my comfort zone: a masterclass in constraint-driven design. By stripping away so many keys and adding thumb keys to (somewhat) compensate, the Planck forces you to fundamentally reconsider core aspects of the layout. Where does Enter go? Backspace? Where's the fucking right Shift? How do you remember where all the symbols are‽‽

There are no easy answers, no one-size-fits-all solution. Not even close. The only way is a descent into the keyboard dark arts: the world of QMK, aka Quantum Mechanical Keyboard. This isn't just remapping keys and adding layers, it's an entire programming language for your keyboard. We're talking tap-hold and double/triple-tap timing intricacies, leader sequences that turn your keyboard into a command line, dynamic on-the-fly custom macros, and layering schemes so complex they'd make an Inception architect's head spin. The result is a layout that is custom-fitted like leather to each typist.

I call these skills the ""keyboard dark arts"" because they are the kinds of things no sane person using a standard layout would ever want or need... but it's that knowledge and those skills that I was after. The Planck wasn't just another keyboard to add to my collection: it was an internship, a trial by fire in these dark arts. A vision quest.

And this, my friends, is the crux of my reasoning for buying the Planck: sometimes you have to break something down to understand how to build it back up better and stronger. I knew going in that this would be painful. I knew I'd hate it. But to truly maximize the potential of the 60%, I needed to step completely outside my comfort zone—I needed a keyboard that would force me to question assumptions and teach me the art of QMK.

And that's exactly what the Planck did.

# The Review Part of the Review

Look, I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here talking about the Planck's build quality—plenty of people have already beaten that horse to death. But since you're here, you get my takes anyway.

The build quality is aggressively meh... but so is the price, so I wasn't expecting much to begin with. The sound profile out of the box is, to put it politely, quite bad: hollow, metallic, and clangy. The foams helped considerably, but we're still a far cry from ""good"" as some hollowness and clanginess lingers.

One gripe I will bring up is that the board has ""eaten"" a fair number of switches, meaning they never came off the plate in one piece. They were in so tight that the switch housings came apart rather than just come loose. At one point, attempting to remove a single switch resulted in the plate and PCB separating entirely, with every other switch being yanked out of their hotswap sockets and pulled up with the plate in the process. What the honest to god fuck?? Two thumbs down there. Get your shit together, Drop.

I tried both the POM and steel plates before settling on BSUN Maple Sugar switches on the steel plate. I used Drop's Jasmin MT3 Ortho keycaps with a green case. The result is decently attractive and a reasonably good typing experience—and that's coming from someone who's already quite picky. It's not going to blow anyone's mind, but even if you're a bit of a snob like me, it (barely) passes muster.

Now, let's dive into the meat of this review: what I loved and hated about living with the Planck.

# The Good Stuff

Let's cover what I really liked about the Planck. It wasn't all frustrations and typos.

**Thumb Keys Are the Light and the Way**

Seriously, having so many keys for my thumbs instead of one giant spacebar is fucking *brilliant*. I love it. Hands down my single favorite feature of the Planck.

I put a 2U spacebar on the right, since I almost exclusively hit Space with my right thumb. It was the perfect size—no more, no less than I needed. (My brief, disastrous experiment with a single-wide spacebar proved that.)

Think about it: your thumbs are incredibly agile and dexterous, yet on a standard keyboard one of them hits a single giant spacebar, usually in the same general spot, while the other floats around doing absolutely nothing. What a waste of real estate and talent!

Anticipating (correctly) a steep learning curve with a ton of errors, I put Backspace and Delete as left-handed thumb keys. And it was fucking *glorious!*

With a traditional Backspace, when you make a mistake, you have to lift your right hand off the home row, reach over to the Backspace key, fix the error, then return to home. It's a constant, if minor, interruption to your flow if you have fat fingers. But with Backspace under my left thumb? I could correct errors instantly without ever breaking stride. My right hand stayed planted on the home row while my left thumb handled all the cleanup. I could even hold Raise with my right thumb, right next to the Spacebar, to turn those keys into ""delete next/previous word.""

The ergonomics are night and day better. No stretching, no reaching, no breaking your wrist position. It's one of those features that sounds minor on paper but transforms the entire typing experience once you've lived with it.

Fuck a giant spacebar, why isn't this standard?

Manufacturers, take note: give us more split spacebars, you cowards!

**It's Fun to Configure**

While using the Planck does feel sometimes like solving a damn Rubik's cube, the actual process of iterating over the layers and configuration is surprisingly fun. Type 2 fun, maybe, but fun nonetheless.

Here's the thing: I'm the type of person who gets genuinely excited about optimizing systems. I'll spend hours refactoring code just to make it more elegant. The Planck tapped into that same part of my brain in a way my 60% boards never could.

With standard layouts, customization feels like rearranging furniture in a house someone else designed. You're mostly just remapping a few existing keys—maybe swapping Caps Lock for Control, swapping modifier positions to accommodate macOS vs Windows, or putting media controls under a function layer. It's useful, but it's not *creative*. There's no real *need* to rethink where Backspace goes because its default location, while arguably suboptimal, is okay.

The Planck, on the other hand, is a blank canvas with insane constraints.

Every key placement becomes a deliberate choice. Where do you put Enter when there's no dedicated place for it? Do you give up easy access to `'""` to put it on the home row, or do you move it down to share a key with Shift? What are the timing settings that allow Shift and Enter to share a key seamlessly for how I personally type so I'm not constantly sending incomplete messages? Or maybe we should leave Shift alone and Enter could be a thumb key? Each decision cascades into others, creating this intricate web of interdependent choices.

Every iteration felt like solving a design problem. I'd identify a pain point—say, I couldn't find underscore reliably, or I was having trouble accessing `Cmd+[` to un-indent code—then experiment with different solutions. Each solution would work for a while, then reveal new problems that needed solving.

It's the same dopamine hit I get from debugging a particularly gnarly piece of code or finally cracking a math problem that's been stumping me. The difference is that this puzzle was *mine*—every solution was tailored to my specific typing and workflow quirks.

That iterative process of problem-solving and refinement? That's where the real magic happened.

Which leads me into my next point...

**QMK Is the Shiiiiiiiiit**

Vial is good, but getting my hands dirty with QMK was a revelation in what's possible with a simple keyboard. This is the heart of the ""dark keyboard arts"" I was chasing.

If Vial is a moped that gets you around town, then QMK is a stripped-down Formula 1 car: insanely powerful, infinitely customizable, but demanding serious skill to master. If Vial is a Swiss Army knife, QMK is a fully-equipped machine shop where you can forge any tool you need... assuming you know how to operate a lathe.

I was resistant at first, sticking to the online QMK Configurator and avoiding the C code... but that was a mistake. Once I dove in, I was hooked. The result is my [QMK userspace repository](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/qmk_userspace), containing all my code, keymaps, and even a few community module contributions. For a detailed breakdown of the layout that resulted from this experiment, see the [layout README](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/qmk_userspace/blob/main/layouts/planck_1x2uR/ohshitgorillas/README.md).

This experience cemented a new rule for me: no more non-QMK keyboards. I was seriously considering a Neo60 Cu until I realized I couldn't load it with QMK. That's a dealbreaker now. Having tasted the raw power of what a keyboard *can* be, I can't go back.

**Comically Small**

Finally, this thing is hilariously small. I have a fairly large desk with ample space for a full-sized board, so this thing just looks completely absurd in my setup. It makes my 60% boards feel like battleships. It's only twice the size of my damn mouse. My watch's strap is longer than this thing is wide. It's ridiculous!

This translates to awesome portability. Tossing it in a bag would be an afterthought, and while I never took it anywhere, it would be the perfect coffee shop or travel board. You can have a decent typing experience on the go without lugging around a 15-pound block of aluminum and copper.

But for a die-hard ortho user, that portability is more than just convenience. While your brain can store multiple keyboard layouts, it can only have one proficiently loaded into your RAM at a time. You cannot simply switch back-and-forth from ortho to staggered—it takes time and a storm of frustrating typos to readjust your muscle memory. For anyone fully committed to the ortho lifestyle, being able to bring your board with you on-the-go is a necessity.

# The Bad Stuff

Alright, let's get into the bullshit. It wasn't all fun and games, and some parts of this experiment were genuinely infuriating.

**The Humbling Experience of Typing Like an Idiot**

There's no way to sugarcoat this: learning an ortholinear layout from scratch is a deeply humbling experience. You have to commit to being a shitty typist for a while, and it fucking sucks.

Your muscle memory is actively working against you, turning every word into a battle. The bottom row is by far the worst offender because all of the keys are a half-unit off from where your fingers expect them. Every time I went to type a `c`, I'd hit `v` or `x` at the same time. The result was a constant stream of typos like `I really fuxcking sucvk at this`.

Even after three weeks, I was pretty good, but never fully got comfortable. On Monkeytype, with just lowercase words, I clawed my way back to a respectable 110 WPM. But the moment I had to introduce punctuation—and note the lack of dedicated dash or parenthesis keys—you can take another 30 WPM off. Numbers? Cut the speed in half and double the errors. Outside of that, there were endlessly frustrating series of cascading mistakes: *Oops, that's a typo, where's th... oh, fuck, did I just hit tab? Undo that too. Oh my god, did I just escape out? Ok, restore foc... argh... there, focus restored. And now ba.. NO, NOT FORWARD DELETE, BACKSPACE. FUCKING FUCK.*

Could I have given it more time and gotten back to full proficiency? Probably. But after three weeks, I felt I'd learned what I needed to and was ready to go back home to my 60s.

Those of you who main these kinds of keyboards? Kudos, seriously. You have more patience, grit, and skill than I do. My 'internship' was difficult enough; I simply cannot imagine using something like this as a daily driver.

**The Constant Mental Overhead is Exhausting**

Beyond the physical clumsiness, the mental load of using the Planck for any real work was significant. A standard keyboard is transparent; you don't *think* about where the keys are, you just type. The Planck was the opposite: a constant puzzle I had to solve just to get my thoughts onto the screen.

It may sound minor, but the constant cognitive friction of going, ""*Okay, there's the dash, tap tap tap, and now there's the open parenthesis, and... no, backspace, now here's the... fuck, that's not it either, THERE's the open parenthesis... tap, tap, tap... now we need an underscore... ope, wrong layer, here's the underscore*"" takes its toll. All those little micro-interruptions are murder on your flow state. When you're deep in a coding problem or trying to articulate a complex idea, the last thing you want is to be derailed by figuring out where the fuck you put F7.

While by the end I was quite fast with a few symbols—mostly `-, _, !, =`—the rest presented a constant mental load with frequent misfires. It wasn't until I switched back to my 60%s that I realized just how draining that was: the feeling of simply hitting number and symbol keys without a second thought was remarkably freeing.

**It's Cheap (and That's Okay)**

Let's be clear: the Planck is an entry-level board, and at $99 for the base kit, the price is fair. It wouldn't have made any sense for me to drop $500 on a keyboard intended as an educational detour. I needed a tool for a temporary job, and for that, the Planck was a great choice. It delivered a decent typing experience for my ""internship"" without breaking the bank.

That being said, coming from a premium board like the Luminkey LX60 Copper Edition—whose kit cost three times the Planck's—or even the KBDfans Tofu60 2.0, the difference is stark. These are admittedly unfair comparisons, but it's what I have, and it highlights what you give up at this price point.

The main thing is the feel. I'm used to keyboards that could double as bludgeoning tools. My Tofu60 2.0 is also a budget board, but it's a dense block of aluminum and brass that feels like a serious instrument. The Planck, by contrast, feels like a toy.

While its weight, or lack thereof, is a huge plus for portability, it feels flimsy and insubstantial at a proper workstation. It slides around and sounds like complete ass without foams (and still not great with). For someone who appreciates the tactile and aesthetic presence of a well-built keyboard, it was a constant, if mild, disappointment.

# So, What Did I Learn?

This whole experiment was about pushing my boundaries and seeing what was on the other side. The Planck was a difficult, frustrating, and ultimately successful teacher. Here's what I'm taking with me:

**The Power of QMK**

QMK is not just about remapping keys and layers. It's not just having your keyboard arrange the modifiers properly based on what operating system it's connected to. It's a fundamental reimagining of what a keyboard can do. It's about transforming a static input device into a dynamic partner that you can teach to handle your most common and tedious tasks. It's about outsourcing the boring parts of typing to your keyboard's firmware so your brain can focus on what matters.

Take the Leader key. I've taught my keyboard my personal and work email addresses. Now, instead of typing them out, I just hit `Leader` `(P/W)` `E` `M`, and the keyboard does it for me. I've even taught it how to tOgGle aUToMated spONGEBOB mOckiNg TExt mOdE (`Leader` `S` `M`), because why the fuck not?

This extends to automating common formatting. With my [implementation of xcase](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/qmk-xcase), I can tell my keyboard to turn spaces into underscores, hyphens, or any other character on the fly. Need to type an obnoxiously long file path? `Leader` `X` `C` `/`, and suddenly all/of/my/spaces/turn/into/slashes.

And finally, there's user-defined automatic typo correction. With autocorrect running at the firmware level, my keyboard knows I'm a dumbass who types 'teh' a dozen times a day and just fixes it for me, everywhere. You know what's even better than a thumb Backspace? *Not needing to hit Backspace at all.*

*That's* the real power of QMK. It’s a toolkit for building a keyboard that becomes a true extension of your own mind—one that anticipates your needs and handles the grunt work for you.

**Mastering Dual-Key Timing is a Superpower**

This was the holy grail for me. I'd struggled in Vial to get a dual-function Caps Lock key that worked reliably—one that could serve as a lightning-fast layer key on hold but still function as a normal Caps Lock on tap. It just wasn't possible; there was too much overlap between tapping and holding. I eventually settled for turning Caps Lock into a dedicated layer key, with the literal Caps Lock feature accessed via holding Caps Lock and hitting the spacebar. It was functional, but not great.

As it turns out, solving this problem required the full arsenal of QMK's advanced timing features. Nailing the precise combination of `TAPPING_TERM`, `HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS`, and `RETRO_TAPPING` felt like cracking a code. The result is flawless: I can trigger the layer in tens of milliseconds for rapid-fire Backspace from the home row *and* reliably activate Caps Lock on a tap. No misfires, ever.

This single victory made the entire painful experiment worth it.

**Home Row Mods FTW**

This is a genuine revelation and one of those 'out of the box' ideas that I may never have been exposed to had I not picked up the Planck. Having modifiers on the home row keys is a massive ergonomic and efficiency boost, and I'm never going back.

For those who are unfamiliar, here's the gist. Each of your eight home keys (`ASDF` and `JKL;`) has two jobs: when you tap it, it prints the character; when you hold it, it acts as a modifier. For my keyboards, `A` and `;` are Ctrl, `S` and `L` are Opt, `D` and `K` are Cmd, and `F` and `J` are Shift.

If this sounds like a horrific idea that would interrupt your typing flow constantly... you're not wrong. Getting the timing right requires some finesse—your keyboard needs to reliably distinguish between a tap and a hold. For Ctrl, Opt, and Cmd (or Alt and Win, if you will), this is relatively straightforward. Shift, however, is a different beast and entirely dependent on how you type. Since Shift is used so frequently mid-typing flow, the timing requirements become incredibly precise. Unless you're willing to invest significant time fine-tuning the settings to match your exact typing rhythm and speed, I'd recommend avoiding Shift as a Home Row Mod except for consistency with chording.

Even ignoring Shift, think about how often you use modifiers. Every copy, paste, and shortcut requires you to contort your fingers into an unnatural position to reach Ctrl or Cmd. Home Row Mods eliminate that entirely. The modifiers are already right under your fingers at all times. Instead of reaching down for Command with one hand and tapping `C` with the other, I just hold `K` and tap `C`. It's faster, more comfortable, and dramatically reduces hand strain. It's one of those changes that feels so right, you'll wonder how you ever tolerated the old way.

**The Nuance of ABS in MT3**

I do not like shined keycaps—the 'stickiness' bothers me, I prefer my fingers to glide over the keycaps—so I've always stayed away from ABS. Give me a fresh, rough-ish batch of PBT any day.

For this board, I broke that rule and went with Drop's Jasmin MT3 keycaps in ABS. I was mostly curious about the MT3 profile, and I figured I wouldn't use the board enough to fully shine the caps by the time my ""internship"" was over.

The keycaps are starting to smooth out, but are still in good shape.

And I'm a big fan of MT3. The scooping is super comfy. And honestly? The profile makes the shine less of an issue for me. I think it's the fact that the scooping gives the key some texture regardless of shining. I could see myself running a set of MT3 ABS until I could see my own reflection in them. I'd still prefer to see Drop offer more MT3 in PBT, but I'm no longer an absolutist.

**60% is My Home**

This experiment solidified it for me. The Planck was a fun, educational, and occasionally infuriating detour, but 60% is where I belong. I need my number keys, and I need a layout that doesn't make me feel like I'm solving a fucking puzzle to type a backslash.

The Planck, again, was a vision quest. It forced me to learn, adapt, and master new skills. It taught me the true power of QMK and revealed the ergonomic benefits of Home Row Mods, as well as how to master tap-hold timing for the Caps Lock key. I'm returning to my 60% boards not because the Planck was bad, but because it succeeded in giving me the knowledge I needed to break out of my rut and make my preferred layout even better (the current state of which can be found [here](https://github.com/ohshitgorillas/qmk_userspace/blob/main/layouts/60_ansi_tsangan_split_bs_rshift/ohshitgorillas/README.md)). I'm glad to be back, but I'm also grateful for the journey.

1p2mls3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p2mls3/how_i_learned_to_talk_to_anyone_even_as_a/,How I learned to talk to anyone (even as a socially anxious introvert who used to panic-order coffee),"Most people I know secretly dread small talk. Even worse? That moment when you blank out mid-convo and just want to disappear. I used to be the type who'd rehearse their Starbucks order 10 times, then still mess it up. But here’s what I’ve learned lately after studying psychology research, reading social skills books, and listening to hours of podcasts on human connection: good conversation isn’t about *talking more*. It’s about listening better, asking smarter questions, and getting out of your own head.

This post is a breakdown of what actually works. No generic “just be confident” nonsense. No TikTok hacks from influencers who’ve never felt social anxiety in their life. Just evidence-based tips, real tools, and some advice from researchers, authors, and social dynamics nerds who’ve studied this stuff for decades.

If you’re introverted, awkward, or just tired of feeling like the weird quiet one, this is for you.

Here’s what’s helped the most:

1. **Stop trying to be interesting. Be interested instead.**  
Harvard psychologist Dr. Robert Waldinger (from the famous 80-year Harvard Study of Adult Development) emphasized that deep connection starts with genuine curiosity. People naturally bond with those who seem fascinated by them. Ask about their experiences, not just surface facts. Replace “What do you do?” with “What made you get into that line of work?” or “What’s been the highlight of your week?” Small shift. Big energy boost.

2. **Use the “FORD” framework to never run out of things to say.**  
This comes from communication trainer Vanessa Van Edwards. “FORD” = Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. These four categories unlock dozens of conversation paths. Get the other person talking about any of these areas, and you’ll build rapport fast without needing to overshare or perform. It’s my go-to cheat code now.

3. **Remember: Awkward silences feel 10x worse in your head.**  
Social psychologist Dr. Gillian Sandstrom found that most people overestimate how awkward they come off. People actually enjoy conversations with strangers *more* than they expect. Your “weird pauses” aren’t as visible as you think. Chill. Give the convo room to breathe.

4. **Don’t aim for chemistry. Aim for rhythm.**  
Chemistry is rare. Rhythm is learnable. In her TED Talk, Celeste Headlee (author of “We Need to Talk”) says the best conversations are like a dance. It’s back and forth. You speak, then let space for reaction. Get out of monologue mode. No one wants to be lectured. They want to feel seen.

5. **Leverage “mirroring” – but don’t make it creepy.**  
This is a powerful principle from Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator. In his book *Never Split The Difference*, he teaches mirroring as repeating the last 1–3 words the other person said in a curious tone. It subconsciously builds trust. Example:  
Them: “I started learning pottery lately.”  
You: “Pottery lately?”  
Them: “Yeah, I’ve always wanted to do something tactile after spending all day on screens…”  
Boom. A real convo just opened up.

6. **Introverts actually have a superpower: deep presence. Use it.**  
Susan Cain’s *Quiet* (a TIME Top 10 Book of the Year) transformed how people view introversion. Cain argues that introverts actually make better listeners, which leads to more meaningful conversations. You don’t need to dominate the room. You just need to show up with full attention. That’s rare these days.

7. **Try to make learning social skills as addictive as TikTok.**  
Train your social muscles like you’d train at the gym. I started using the app **Charisma on Command**. It gamifies conversation skills, with mini challenges like starting convos with strangers or practicing eye contact in low-stakes situations. Doing 10 minutes a day totally shifted my baseline confidence. It’s like Duolingo for people-ing.

8. **I recommend checking out the app BeFreed.**  
It’s an AI-powered audio learning app built by a team from Columbia University. You pick your learning goals (like communication skills, confidence, or leadership), and it creates a personalized audio plan using summaries from books, expert interviews, and real-world examples. The coolest part? You can choose your preferred podcast length (10, 20 or 40 minutes), and even the host’s voice and personality. Mine sounds like a chill therapist-meets-standup comic.

What makes it addictive is that it actually learns from my listening history and updates my learning roadmap weekly. It’s like having a personal AI coach who knows you better than your friends. BeFreed has deep libraries on everything we talked about here — from Susan Cain’s *Quiet*, to Dale Carnegie’s *How to Win Friends*, to modern relationship science podcasts. 

And swapping 10 minutes of doomscrolling for this has had a crazy compounding effect. One year later, I don’t panic at networking events. I actually *like* talking to people now.

9. **If you only read one social skills book, make it this one.**  
*The Like Switch* by ex-FBI agent Jack Schafer is hands-down the best book I’ve ever read on human connection. Schafer was trained to get people to talk even in life-or-death interrogations. This book breaks down human behavior in a way that instantly made me go “Ohh…so *that’s* why that convo felt off.” It’s filled with practical tools like the “friendship formula,” the “lip corner pull” cue, and how to nonverbally make someone feel safe around you. This book will make you question everything you think you know about charisma. Insanely good read.

10. **If you love podcasts, this one blew my mind.**  
*The Art of Charm* podcast used to feel like your standard bro-y self-help thing, but it’s now hosted by smart behavioral experts breaking down things like nervous system regulation, small talk anxiety, and how to build professional relationships from scratch. Ep #567 on “Social Cold Starts” is a must-listen if you freeze up at parties or meetings.

11. **Best YouTube channel for social anxiety recovery?**  
**Improvement Pill** is packed with helpful, science-backed visuals on habit change, confidence, and leveling up social skills one tiny step at a time. It’s not cringey or preachy. Just really solid content that makes you go “Why wasn’t I taught this in school?”

12. **Start with just 1% of courage. Don’t aim to be extroverted.**  
Dr. Andrew Huberman calls this the “activation energy” principle. You don’t need to rewrite your personality. Just do one brave thing per day — talk to a stranger, raise your hand, say that joke you’d normally swallow. It’s like social pushups. You build tolerance by doing hard things in small doses.

If you’ve ever walked away from a convo and re-played every weird thing you said, you’re not alone. But the best-kept secret? Most people are too busy worrying about *their own* weirdness to notice yours. And the most magnetic people aren’t the loudest — they’re the ones who make others feel heard.

There’s this girl in my class, let’s call her Talia. A few weeks ago, she asked a mutual friend for my number and texted me saying she had some questions about our econ exam. We had a friendly, casual chat about the exam and midterms.

A few days later, I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee on Friday. She said she was working unfortunately, so I said ""Ahh gotcha, Maybe another time"" then she replied “yeah for sure!”.

After that, I didn’t push. On Monday, I texted her again casually about our class grades: “Yo, the grades are posted for class. How’d it go for u?” She hasn’t responded since that text.

I feel like I handled things respectfully. I asked her out once, and didn’t chase. But now I’m not sure what her silence means. Is she not interested? Should I try to reach out again, or just let it go?",0,1763691559.0,AskMenAdvice,33,0.38,False
