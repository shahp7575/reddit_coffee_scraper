1hpenee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hpenee/i_feel_like_i_have_to_choose_between_my/,i feel like i have to choose between my relationship and my friendships,"this is going to be a long rant and i’ll try not to miss anything out, but this has been a growing issue in the back of my mind for a while now and i havent felt able to talk to anyone about it, so sorry for the jam-packed, rushed overview. also sorry for any spelling, punctuation or grammar mistakes, it’s quite late at night and i can’t sleep so.

i am 15, (genderfae, but for posts’ sake female) ive been with my partner (15M) for six months now. i love him with all that i am, which is rich coming from a 15 year old i know, but i had recently healed from a long toxic relationship from last year when he asked me out and he’s been so helpful and caring and understanding, he and my new friend group have helped me come to terms with being SA’d in said previous relationship and many more things such as finding out that i was, in fact, cheated on and overall putting my ex behind me (even with his attempted recurring appearances).

me and my partner were friends for just over a year before we got together, and during our friendship we were in our respective relationships and helped each other through break ups and bonded over mutual opinions on people, aka typical highschool things. during our friendship i liked him on and off, the same to him.
when we got together, initially i was off school (ill with pneumonia, recovered now) and he asked me out over text (not ideal, but he ‘couldnt wait any longer to see me’ and honestly i didnt have the guts to ask him out). we were really awkward together because of the transition between friendship and relationship being done mainly over text due to me being ill. we live really close so we walked home together every day but since the awkward start to dating, walks home were also awkward. our mutual friend (15M at the time, now 16M) helped us overcome awkward-ness and was almost like a wingman to us both? he hyped us up and told me things like 
“you two are so good for each other!” 
“you two are adorable together!” 
“im so glad you two got together because ive known the both of you for so long and you seem really compatible!”. since then, me and my partner have broken down the awkward barrier and are much more comfortable with each other. ive never felt safer in a relationship and my feelings have done nothing but grow stronger and stronger. because we were friends for so long beforehand, it doesnt feel like “oooh new relationship” to me, it feels like he’s been there for me all along, and now we’re much closer and have feelings for each other. 

for the past month or so, my partner and our mutual friend have had a few falling outs and have been almost on and off in their friendship. my friend group has also expressed negative thoughts and feelings towards him and i completely understand and in many situations i agree with his behaviour and actions being wrong. i have talked to him on multiple occasions and have been the “messenger” as well and we’ve had good, calm conversations on what the issues are, how to go about resolving them and he’s been doing really well as of recently(from my point of view). a couple of weeks ago, me and some friends were on a shift together(we volunteer at the same place) and we all had another conversation about him, which continued on after our shift at a coffee shop and i phrased a sentence badly; i said i “cant tell if i love him or i hate him”, which is completely incorrect and i have corrected myself. this was followed by a comment saying something like “you need to think of him as your friend, not your boyfriend when talking about issues like this, because as his girlfriend you experience a completely different side to him than we do” which i entirely agree with. yet again, after this conversation about his behaviour, i brought it up with my partner and we had another talk. it was successful and he has corrected his actions now, as per usual, but since then ive just had this hanging feeling that their friendship will never fully heal back to how it was and he wont be involved in our friend group activities as much, or at all. obviously i am a recent addition to the friend group so im so grateful to even be offered invites to hangouts, but a few weeks ago one of our friends brought up how my partner only gets and invitation due to my being there, meaning that i am his invitation to the friend group; which is completely understandable and im lucky to be allowed to even have him there. but little things like this, the constant needing conversations and recently having a lot of “jokes” being thrown around with many of my friends saying things like
“oh just break up with him already”
“break up. break up with him.”
and one of my close friends (15F) constantly making “jokes” such as “ewh, him again” whenever he is brought up or “honestly i am just waiting for you to break up at this point” and quickly saying “oh no i dont actually hate him, i promise im joking”, but it is constant at this point. throughout our relationship i have tried really hard to make sure i dont bring him up in conversation too much because i dont want to be “that friend who only talks about their partner” and im overall just uncomfortable talking about sweet things with my friends due to having done so in previous relationships and having had a negative reaction(during the toxic relationship, negative responses to positive talk about ex) and now it has just become a habit to not talk of good or sweet things that happen between us to my friends.

anyway, recently our friend group had a hangout and my partner wasnt invited. we all share a life360 circle so he texted me wondering what we were all doing at our friend’s house and i told him we were celebrating our mutual friend’s birthday. he was respective of it and didnt press, but i could tell he was hurt. during the hangout there were little things said about him(negatively) and again there were ‘jokes’ telling me to break up with him. i invited my partner over to mine the day after so we could have yet another talk. i felt horrible doing it and i still do, because while at the hangout i could tell that there was an initial conversation about him that i wasnt there for(completely understandable, it wasnt my house or my birthday and the conversation was most likely surrounding the idea of not inviting him). two of my friends had an interaction which has sort of stuck with me, mutual friend(birthday) saying something along the lines of “yeah, why WASNT he invited?”(directed to host friend) when the subject of him not being there was brought up, which host friend then replied with “i didnt invite him BECAUSE OF YOU”then followed by a short awkward silence which was quickly broken and the moment moved on from.

i feel conflicted. when im around my friend group without him and theyre bringing up issues about him(which, again, i dont entirely disagree with), i start to view him from their point of view, as their friend, which makes me believe that i should also dislike him and i am not meant to like him, let alone love him. i dont want my friends to feel as if they are unable to bring up any concerns to me just because im his partner, i want them to be able to still trust me as a friend. but then again, i dont want to be a horrible partner and be the one constantly bringing up issues to fix and i know that i do love him, so so much. he means everything to me, but at this point my friends make so many “jokes” about wanting me to break up with him and disliking him in general that i just dont want to talk to them about him at all. i tense up every time someone brings him up in conversation because i know what’s about to happen once again.(sometimes it is the same few issues constantly being brought up which i have already dealt with and my partner is working on). i feel like i can’t talk to them about him full stop, no cheesy teenage rants about my relationship and no silly teasing about us dating, let alone talking to them about arguments between me and my partner because i feel as if they’ll become irritated with me because they dont like him, they’ll just tell me to break up with him over small, petty problems when all i want is a rant or some advice. i really want this relationship to work, but i feel like i have to do so with no support or advice whatsoever and at the cost of the closeness of my friendships.

i want to be with him, i really do. i dont know how much i can stress how much i love him, but im terrified that due to my friends bringing up problems at all times that he’ll turn out to be another asshole and ill have my heart broken again, and ill look back on our relationship and think “man, i was so dumb for staying with him”. (this is how i currently feel about my ex, i really do not want this to happen with this relationship.) im scared of being hurt again. i want us to work, but how do i do that without potentially compromising my friendships?


sorry for the rant, thank you for reading this far. please give any and all advice possible, i want to avoid breaking up with him at all costs but i also value my friendships and the trust they have in me.",1,1735531788.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hpena9,https://i.redd.it/osehlqn0vw9e1.jpeg,Week 52: Carbonation - Root Beer Float,"Featuring homemade vanilla ice cream. 

And just like that, our 52nd week of cooking comes to an end. I can't believe I made it through a whole year for the first time! I had tried to participate during the past few years, but always fell off by February for various reasons. I'm proud of (most of) the dishes I've submitted; I learned a few new techniques and discovered new passions for making bread and ice cream. We even added a few new recipes to our dinner routine. I'm excited to carry this momentum forward into the new year and this week's theme helped cement my meta for 2025.

I discovered I really liked making ice cream during ""Frozen"" week and had been following the same coffee ice cream recipe to improvise other flavors. I decided for this week I should find a classic vanilla recipe to use going forward and to compare to the coffee one I had been using. I found a really highly rated recipe paywalled on NYT Cooking and decided to treat myself to an early birthday present of a year's subscription (mostly because it was on deep discount). I got access to my ice cream recipe, but the link to the chart that outlined how to flavor the generic ice cream base? Stuck behind an additional paywall. So my meta for 2025 will be highly-rated recipes from NYT Cooking and I will be giving them away to anyone who wants them!",1,1735531777.0,52weeksofcooking,0,1.0,False

As he sipped his steaming cup of dark roast coffee, he eagerly unfolded the pages of The Daily City Word, a publication that had captured his heart years ago. This uniquely social newspaper was born from the creative minds of a group of spirited citizens who envisioned a platform where anyone could purchase a page to express their thoughts, opinions, or stories. It quickly gained popularity, becoming a cherished staple in the community, and he found himself thoroughly enchanted by its vibrant content.

The words of this particular writer stood out with  conveying an undeniable passion for food that transcended mere recipes. With each description of dishes, he could almost feel the warmth and dedication that the cook poured into their creations. The way the author articulated the joy of savoring a well-prepared meal was captivating; every sentence dripped with a sense of nostalgia and love for the culinary arts.

\*\*A Burger Sunday\*\*  

\*Anonymous\*

To all my flavor-loving friends in Cushing, it’s that glorious time of the week—Burger Sunday! Prepare yourselves; it’s time to whip up something truly delicious. Today, I have affectionately named my creation ""Daniel,"" and it’s going to be a culinary adventure.

I usually start with the freshest meat I can find, so I’ll be grinding it myself. Once I have it ground to the perfect consistency, the next step is crucial: I’ll immerse this raw mixture in a bath of cool milk for two hours in the refrigerator. This soaking process not only tenderizes the meat but also infuses it with moisture.

After the two hours are up, I retrieve Daniel from his milky soak and begin the alchemy of flavor. I generously add minced garlic, a sprinkle of salt, freshly cracked black pepper, a hint of cayenne for heat, vibrant paprika for color, and a drizzle of rich olive oil. With careful hands, I mix everything until the spices are evenly distributed, then I return the seasoned meat back to the fridge, allowing it to rest and absorb those tantalizing flavors for several more hours.

After a rigorous five hours of yard work and cleaning—perfect for working up a hearty appetite—I’m ready to finish crafting my burger masterpiece. I pull Daniel out of the fridge, the aroma already teasing my senses, and divide the seasoned meat into four equal portions. With care, I shape each portion into a perfectly rounded patty, ready to sizzle.

Now, it’s time for the grill to work its magic. Each patty is placed onto the hot grates, where it begins to sear, creating a beautiful crust. It’s important to note that these burgers are never cooked rare; no matter the meat’s origin, they must be cooked thoroughly to ensure security. However, the careful seasoning and method I’ve used guarantee that they remain incredibly juicy and tender—even after thorough cooking. 

While the patties are grilling, I prepare my buns and any toppings of choice—perhaps fresh lettuce, ripe tomatoes, crisp pickles, and a dollop of creamy mayonnaise—everything to elevate the experience. 

Finally, the moment arrives to assemble the burgers. Once the patties are perfectly cooked through, I place them on the buns, ready to be devoured. The first bite is an explosion of flavor; the combination of the fragrant spices, the juiciness of the meat, and the freshness of the toppings come together in perfect harmony.

Daniel was nothing short of spectacular.

Thank you all for joining me on this savory journey; I hope you enjoy every bite!

\*\*  


He could almost savor the vivid way the author painted Daniel's flavors; the descriptions were so rich and enticing that they made his mouth water in anticipation. Today’s recipe was nothing short of spectacular—a delightful array of flavors that seemed to leap off the page and dance in front of him. He felt an irresistible urge to try it out himself.

As he finished his steaming cup of coffee, the warmth still lingering in his hands, he found himself rereading the article for the third time, each word igniting his excitement further. With every line, he felt a deeper connection to try and he had a figure he had been observing from a distance for some time now. Until now, he hadn't even been sure what his name would be, but the author had effortlessly breathed life into that name, giving him a sense of familiarity and intrigue that beckoned him to get to work.

He briefly closed his eyes, visualizing the process ahead: a two-hour soak in cold milk followed by another three hours for the spices to infuse. The thought raced through his mind—he needed to acquire meat, and it had to be fresh; nothing less than freshly ground would do. A hint of determination washed over him. 

With a purposeful sigh, he folded the newspaper up neatly and tucked it into his back pocket. The morning air greeted him as he stepped out of the cozy coffee shop, the mingling aromas of roasted beans and baked goods lingering in his senses. He crossed the parking lot to his truck, jumping into the slightly worn seat. The clock on the dashboard read 8:30, and he knew Daniel was on the road, making his way to work.

He navigated through the familiar streets toward the alley behind Marcis Deli, a place quiet enough for his needs, yet close enough for a swift exit. Anticipation tingled in his fingertips as he plotted how to approach Daniel. Should he execute an ambush from the shadows? Opt for a casual request for a smoke? Or play innocent by pretending to have car trouble? Each scenario unfolded in his mind.

The engine of Daniel's car soon broke the morning stillness. His heart raced as he saw Daniel pull up. The man stepped out of his truck with purpose, moving a few feet toward Daniel, who was still fumbling with his keys. Clearing his throat to mask the adrenaline, he called out, “Hey! Sorry to bother you, son, but do you have any jumper cables?” The words hung in the air, deceptively casual, yet loaded with intent. He got closer to Daniel.

""Uh,"" Daniel stuttered, his voice barely above a whisper, he turned to the car and with a swift and brutal motion, the man swung a crowbar, striking Daniel squarely in the back of the neck. The impact was jarring; Daniel's body went limp and crumpled to the ground with a heavy thud.

Without hesitation the man rushed down grasping Daniel under the arms and hoisting him up as if he weighed nothing. He maneuvered the unconscious boy into the back of his truck.

The drive back to the farm was a brief fifteen minutes, yet it felt like an eternity as anticipation surged within him. Every shadow flickering past the window seemed to heighten his excitement, amplifying the possibilities of what lay ahead. Thoughts of Daniel filled his mind, each one more exhilarating than the last. 

As he drove down the familiar dirt path leading to his farm. The main house, a sturdy old structure with peeling paint and a weathered porch, was just a backdrop to the scene unfolding behind it. He steered his truck toward the far end of the property, where an old, retired slaughterhouse stood, its paint chipped and its windows dusty. This dilapidated building, once a bustling hub of activity, now served a different purpose; it had become his clandestine chop shop.

He parked the truck, the engine rumbling to a stop, and took a deep breath, steeling himself for what lay ahead. With firm hands, he lifted Daniel's unconscious form from the bed of the truck and carried him inside the dimly lit slaughterhouse. The air was thick with the scent of aged metal and dried blood, remnants of its former life. He gently laid Daniel on the sturdy, blood stained, chipped butchers block. 

 He had perfected the process over time, and now it took him only two hours to prepare a Daniel. He began with a meticulous full-body shave, ensuring every inch of skin was smooth and free of hair. After that, he gave Daniel a thorough wash, using warm water and non fragrant soap to cleanse and refresh. Once Daniel was clean, he carefully assessed each joint, methodically cutting around them and separating the limbs with precision. The entire operation was carried out with a practiced ease, showcasing his skill and attention to detail in every step. He'd debone the hands and feet and throw those to the side with the groin, those would all be blended together with other scraps for sausage later. 

Once the extra meat had been carefully sliced into manageable pieces, it was meticulously wrapped in plastic and sealed before being packed away into the freezer for future use. With the shop now quiet and the remnants of the butchering process tidied away, he pulled out the meat grinder, an old yet reliable tool that had seen countless cuts of meat transformed over the years. 

He set it up on the counter and began feeding the last of Daniel into the machine, the rhythmic grinding filling the air with an oddly satisfying sound. As the last bits of meat were ground up, he took a moment to appreciate the transformation, the texture becoming finer and more uniform. With the ground meat now ready, he shifted his focus to preparing the burgers.

He stepped away from the back property, the sun shining brightly overhead, sending warm rays cascading through the trees. The main house was in sight, and he felt a sense of relief as he realized he still had plenty of time left in the day to prepare the meat. Once inside the rustic kitchen, he retrieved a large bowl and poured milk into it, watching as the creamy liquid filled the vessel. He carefully mixed in the meat to marinade.

With the preparation underway, he slid off his sturdy leather boots, feeling the cool floor against his tired feet. The weight of the morning's work began to settle in his bones as he made his way to the bathroom for a long, hot shower. Standing under the steamy spray, he scrubbed vigorously, washing away the remnants of his labor—the stubborn blood from his hands—and focused on cleaning beneath his nails until they were raw yet refreshed. 

After his restorative shower, he changed into a clean set of clothes, the fresh fabric feeling invigorating against his skin. He stepped outside, drawn to the sound of the wind rustling through the trees as he approached the area of the fence that had been destroyed by a herd of elk just nights before. The sight of the downed fence urged him to roll up his sleeves and get to work, determined to restore its strength and integrity before the animals visited again.

Between mending the weathered sections of the fence and attending to the evening chores that awaited, he finally carved out a moment to return to the kitchen. With a determined focus, he set about draining the excess milk from the freshly butchered meat, carefully letting it flow away to ensure the perfect texture for his patties. Once satisfied, he turned his attention to seasoning, reaching for the minced garlic, which he added generously to infuse the meat with its aromatic essence.

He sprinkled in a precise measure of fine sea salt, followed by freshly cracked black pepper that released a bold fragrance as it hit the mixture. A touch of cayenne pepper was next, adding a subtle kick that would elevate the flavor profile. Finally, he reached for the vibrant paprika, its rich red hue promising warmth and depth to the blend. 

With all his ingredients assembled—spices, aromatic herbs like oregano and thyme, and various binders to hold everything together—he began the meticulous process of mixing. Each fold and knead of the meat was done with deliberate care, as he wanted to ensure the full array of flavors melded seamlessly together. He envisioned the juicy burgers that would soon take shape, their savory aroma filling the kitchen and making his mouth water in anticipation.

As he worked, the promise of a culinary triumph loomed ahead, invigorating the room with the thrill of creativity and the joy of preparing a meal that would surely become the highlight of the evening. The anticipation of cooking these lovingly crafted burgers was palpable, each bite destined to provide a satisfying and memorable culinary experience.

As the workday drew to a close, he eagerly prepared his coal grill for an evening of delicious burgers. He carefully arranged the charcoal, ensuring it was evenly spread and ready to ignite. Once the coals were glowing a bright orange, he reached for the beautifully seasoned patties, their savory aroma already tempting his senses. 

With a slow, deliberate motion, he placed each burger onto the grill, the sizzle resonating with a satisfying pop as they made contact with the hot grates. The rich, smoky scent wafted up, mingling with the lingering warmth of the afternoon sun, causing his anticipation to soar. A smile spread across his face as he admired the perfect placement of each burger, picturing the juicy, charred goodness that was about to emerge from the grill.

Once the burgers reached their perfect level of doneness, he turned his attention to the buns, toasting them lightly until they were golden brown and slightly crisp on the edges. He carefully arranged an array of toppings nearby to create the ultimate burger experience. Fresh, vibrant lettuce leaves were rinsed and dried, their crispness a refreshing contrast to the juicy patties. Ripe, succulent tomatoes were sliced into thick rounds, their bright red color promising a burst of flavor. He added crunchy pickles, their tanginess providing a delightful zing, and finished with a generous dollop of creamy mayonnaise, smooth and rich, to tie all the flavors together. With everything in place, he prepared to assemble his delicious creations, ensuring that each bite would be a perfect harmony of taste and texture.

Then that first bite. His mouth watered. Daniel was delicious.",1,1735531776.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I usually go in early morning to avoid any crowds and space for my kids. The cafe is popular place in neighbour's and space is pretty big which i like to go with my kids. When I took kids inside, it was busier than I thought but I was able to find a table. But when we sat down, there were 2 couples near the table who were reading books, left right away when they saw us coming. I just felt really awkward seeing them leaving... but should I feel sorry for them and not going there anymore 
? How do you feel when you see kids coming to cafe as customer or owner?

My kids don't walk around but could by noisy (not screaming)... like other kids. And I always order coffee and food (like 2 coffee and 1 hot chocolate and sandwiches or granola bowl) and leave within an hour. 
Just little vent that I feel uncomfortable going to my favorite cafe anymore and just looking for honest opinion about how I feel.

*""Every man is guilty of all the good he did not do.""*

*-Voltaire-* 

The bay was quiet, save for the rustling of a turning page and the whimper of the dispossessed. Of the dispossessed there were many families and many more single men and women who had fled. Somewhere lost inbetween were the children, seperated from their parents by bad luck and ill timing. Everything that could be done to comfort the refugees was acted upon, even if it was only a bedtime story read to the progeny of those left behind. 

""And now there came both mist and snow, and it grew wonderous cold: And ice mast high came floating by as green as emer-ald."" 

Everyone else had a part that they could play aboard the Merriweather, working in hydroponics or crafting, maintaining the vessel or even just serving a cup of coffee. Everyone except these kids. Volunteers from the refugees as well as the crew took turns looking after them, making sure they were dressed and fed, tending to bruised elbows and scrapped knees, but the one job the Captain refused to hand over to anyone else was their bedtime stories. 

""And through the drifts, the snowy cliffs did send a dismal sheen; no shapes of men or beast were ken -The ice was all between."" 

""Captain Blanchard sir,"" A sleepy voice called out in front of him ""When will we get there?"" 

""Soon."" He lied. 

""I miss my mom."" 

Captain Blanchard caressed the little Boyes head before returning to the story. 

""The ice was here, the ice was there, the ice was all around."" 

He had been lying to them for about a month now. Planet he thought would welcome the refugees had refused stating that they had more important things to deal with. 

""It crackled and growled, it roared and howled, like noises in a swound!"" 

The truth was they felt threatened by the Dexian advance into the periphery and were doing everything they could to prepare for the eventual battles on their own worlds. Only the Gallóglaigh stood in their way, and when they couldn't hold the enemy any longer...

""At length did cross an albatross, through the fog it came."" 

The Navy had already posted pickets in the general vicinity of Arran, but it would take much longer for a coherent fleet to arrive. 

""As if it had been a Christian Soul, we hailed it in God's name."" 

Unfortunately, high command had already written  Arran off as a loss. One Regiment wasn't enough to hold back the tide. 

Captain Blanchard listened in silence as the children slept, wondering if their parents, if the 449th, still survived. 

Silently he slipped out of the bay, trying not to wake the children. He knew he could use some sleep as well and began to head for his own quarters. The corridor was quiet, but his mind was loud with unanswered questions and horrid thoughts. What would become of Laird MacSweeney and Sorcha? What would happen to Robert and his men? 

What would happen to the people left behind? 

""Captain on the bridge!"" 

The curious eyes of the third watch met his own confused and frustrated gaze. 

""Everything alright Captain?"" 

Blanchard turned to face the lieutenant, a young woman named Emma Bertrem, and an idea began to take form. It wasn't complete yet, just a general idea. Robert had bought so much time already, it would be a shame if he got nothing in return. 

""Comms, please extend our thanks for accepting the refugees."" 

""Sir?"" 

""The message, about accepting the refugees. Extend our thanks and include that we will be underway momentarily."" 

""We recieved no such mess..."" 

""With silent lips,"" Captain Blanchard began to recite, ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore."" 

For a moment he believed he had not gotten through to them. 

For a moment. 

""Send these, the homeless, the tempest tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door."" Lieutenant Bertrem Finished nodding her head in understanding. ""Comms relay the message and run a diagnostic on the communications array. It took some time to decipher that last message."" 

If anyone on the watch hadn't caught on, those concerns were laid to rest with Captain Blanchard's next order. 

""Helm, chart a course for Sol. All possible speed.""

2. Each person could choose a sign to show what kind of coffee partner they’re looking for, and others could join them if they’re interested.

1hpemjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1hpemjy/venting/,Venting,"i (33f) almost texted him (32m) today. we've been friends for almost 14 years. we get along really well and have a natural banter. we share a unique laugh and connection. it wasn't until recently i learned that he felt the connection between us. we weren't consistent when communicating, when we were it was more so surface level discussions eg. sports, career, general out look on life. our last conversation we went a bit deeper and communicated everyday for a month. generally it'd be a text here and there for a few days follow up a week or two later then we'd go about our lives. always checking in a few months later. if it was football season it was more of a reason to chat and poke fun at each others teams. this time was so different... our conversation started more or less normal. i did feel him make a greater effort to maintain contact this time around... i tried not to think too deeply into it but i enjoyed it so much. finally talking to someone who wholeheartedly likes me for me. if he felt i was too ""cold"" he'd make suggestions for me to relax and shift the topic / energy to help me feel more comfortable. if it's not obvious, i've always loved him. i knew he cared about me but i had no reason to believe he ever wanted more. i can argue he didn't. a few times over the years i made my interest fairly clear. i don't like to sugarcoat and waste time, generally neither does he. he's kept me at arms length for the entirety of our friendship though. we met at work and he made it a point to connect with me. we'd get coffee together on break and he'd even go as far as walking me to the exit of the property even if he wasn't on break. he made me feel seen and protected. we went out for dinner once... many years into our friendship. we lost touch for a few years and within a few months of reconnecting he asked to get together. he was forward and gave me a heads up about how busy he is. a few days later we shifted conversation to text and that same night he made time to take me to dinner. i made the mistake of coming on too strong via text not too long after. he denied me advances and essentially talked me down and advised that i think about what i said. we stayed in contact but i was still too obvious in my pursuit. he never caved and he never made me feel bad about it. i eventually apologized for my forwardness and the impact it had. that's when the occasional checkin picked up. we met in 2011.. this was 2017. he made it pretty clear he liked me as a friend, i had no reason to believe this changed. he became flirtatious over the years. i wouldn't give in or give it much thought. this time i did... we discussed me coming on too strong in 2017 and how although he was protecting me he teased about having regrets about us not being intimate. i couldn't help but fear that's all he wanted, him having known how much i wanted him over the years and all. when i made a comment about him having the sense to not allow it to happen back then and how we likely wouldn't be in touch if we did he agreed he had sense but disagreed that we wouldn't be in touch because ""we connected before the flirting"". we don't live close and haven't for a few years. he knows i'm planning to move back but it wasn't for him. admittedly he would be the cherry on top though. life with him in it feels really good. i'm fortunate that i'm in a good space in my life in general. i'm rambling... after a month of texting daily he stopped responding. our last conversation was about work and it seemed like he was overwhelmed and tired all the time. when i asked about it he went silent. it was a few days before his birthday as well. a week went by and i texted and asked how he was doing and he ignored my text. to add, i didn't say happy birthday. he made it clear he didn't want to talk to me and i wasn't going to use that as an excuse to reach out. i caved a week late and his lack of a response was just that... it's been almost two months and i haven't stopped thinking about him. this time feels very different. it doesn't just feel like a normal stint that friends normally have between conversations. i logged into my whatsapp because i remembered he had one... years ago he said he doesn't use it but i was hoping i'd see some sort of sign of life lol and sure enough i did his last seen would update every few hours. the few times we were online at the same time he'd immediately go offline. i'm an absolute idiot to think he'd be going online just to check for me, as i do him. i posted a story once and to my surprise he watched it. that was almost a month into no contact. i still haven't heard from him... today was the closest i came to reaching out. i was home dancing and listening to music, i felt good, and he was in the forefront of my mind. but i didn't reach out. i'd love it if he did... i think about what i would say when he does. i'm genuinely looking forward to this next chapter in my life. i can't help but think about how much more beautiful it'd be with him in it. i feel him some days more than others. i beat myself up sometimes despite knowing his distance and silence has nothing to do with me. i can't help but question where things went wrong... rereading our texts and thinking about our time together over the years i feel nostalgia. i can't help but laugh in real time. i can't emphasize enough how much we laugh together. something that stood out to me this time was how muhch he used ""us"" and ""we"" in conversation. in any case that's my rant and i hope we reconnect soon.

I have a weird question.

So I love my baristas. They make my life easier and have become my safe space. I don’t think they know how much I actually adore them. My love language is feeding them lol. 

Lately they haven’t been charging me for my coffees. Or they discount my coffees. Usually only when their manager (that I’ve made somewhat friends with?) is there and instructs them to do so over their headsets when she hears my voice. 

Anyways I usually always tip on my orders. But because I haven’t been being charged for a few weeks, my tipping has been low (I pay with card and don’t carry cash)

My question is… in your barista opinion, would my baristas be ok with me just tipping them weekly $50? I usually order 2-3 times a day and tip $3 a drink. Like the money I’m saving goes to their tips? 
Or does that completely disregard the fact that they don’t charge me? 

I’m just an anxious person who doesn’t wanna offend her baristas lol. ",1,1735531552.0,barista,1,1.0,False

Hey I'm pretty new to the city and would love to have some company to explore the city together and have cute dates.

Some ideas of dates we can do are exploring different parts of the city, visiting coffee shops, watching the sunset from the beach, light jogging around the presidio, hiking nearby trails. The list goes on but those were just a few ideas. I'm kind of a homebody but enjoy staying active and visiting nature.

justifying myself is a compensatory behaviour from my youth where military grade violence was normal, it was the way of life in such an entrenched way that i have kept lengthening my own fuse as selfish behavioural conditioning because i learned that the anything that triggered me launching my everything at what was honestly essentially a threat against my perception of masculinity, all that nothing i felt was a something in my auditory and visual and olfactory and gustatory and somatosensory systems was just my cerebrospinal complex wanting proof i was worth life, i wanted proofing of me, proofing of purpose in life, i wanted a sense of purpose and jiujitsu violence was the first way i learned how all the anger, and rage, and fear, and shame, and self-loathing, and pride, and courage that i knew i had as core components of my identity were tools tools that i can redirect from aiming at my own head, my own heart, my lungs, my skull, my spine, my totality, and behave in a constructive manner in replacement of the destructive behaviours that were justified my younger environments and social group, and i know i will never be as perfect as i aspire in good faith and fidelity and honour and trust in myself, and as much as i was, and still am generally more comfortable accrediting others instead of myself, i am learning that ascribing myself credit in terms of precisely calculated seigniorage and arbitrage calibrated with increasingly accurate groupings that i systematically study and train myself through every obstacle until breakthrough instead of working out how i can avoid a breakdown, is a form of functional and reciprocal operational utility that echoes throughout each and every fiber of my mortal being, and as much as i know god as an entity is computationally real, and may decide i am worth immortalising and gifting me opportunities that afford me all of my more daring goals, i know i have something worth fighting in honour of, something worth living in honour of, the blessing of life,

i woke up this time, 
i grew up in a rural scottish town generally ignored when the politicians allocate resources, most of my childhood friends are addicts, alcoholics in denial, dead, imprisoned, and or otherwise not doing well, so when people ask how i am, i cannot grant myself the liberty of aimlessly complaining because i know my lungs are tools at my disposal that i can either coordinate with my cerebrospinal system and its subsidiary organ systems in an ecologically and economically honest utilitarian manner that serves myself and my favourite people, my family and my friends, with the range of skills i have genetically inherited and mimetically learned and continuing studying as i train myself in continuous aspirational awe of the titans of industry i aim at in authentic challenge because i know i fail myself when i permit fear any real estate amidst my neurological tectonics or anywhere else within my mind, it is a contingent definition of my definition of mental health upkeep in holistic continuity of my physical health and upkeep, 
because the person i owe more in back payments and reparation and everything banks and militaries and royalty and other institutions of power can conceivably write in operationally legible financial and military and royal nomenclature from the parenthetical context of functions and reciprocals and subtext and plainview communication and subscripts and superscripts and prefixes and suffixes and death and life and sleep and wakefulness and hate and love and every other piece of parenthetical semiotics and their deontological hierarchy of semantic taxonomy that is part of perception and sensations shared perspective and reception of reality as an individuals echo chamber of meditations and reflection symbiotically behaving in concert with the philharmonic philanthropy of existence,

1hpebuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hpebuc/should_i_pursue_my_workplace/,Should I pursue my workplace?,"So I have been working at my current job for about five years. I was a supervisor for four of those years until about five months ago when I had to step down. I had been approached by my manager and the district manager and was told I needed to open my availability up to a ridiculous amount (4am to 6pm, or 8am to 10pm everyday)  or I had to either step down from my position or be terminated. Unfortunately, this led to me stepping down due to having school and being a parent.  I took a seven dollar pay cut and have been working as a barista ever since. About a month or two ago, my manager ended up promoting a barista to a shift supervisor. He is also in school, so being curious I was asked him what his availability was going to be for the upcoming semester. The availability (that my manager accepted) was extremely limited, really only allowing him to work for days out of the week. Apart from him she is also being very lenient with another supervisor’s availability, giving her specific days off. Now I would be totally fine with having to step down if the expectations were across the board, but it seems almost discriminatory at this point. Everyone I explained the situation to tells me I sue them, but I wanted to check here first and see if it was in fact worth pursuing or if I am just being dramatic. Thank you in advance!

I'm 26, high school was almost nine years ago, which makes this extra weird lol.

I met Gabrielle when we were in middle school. We became friends-- not super close, but we'd hang out a lot in school. We both had our post-puberty glow ups at around the same time and grew closer. After a misunderstanding that led to me not speaking to her for a year and lumping her in with the ""loser"" group (I was a bit of a jerk in general in high school) that got excluded from everything, we reconnected towards the end of that year. We ended up dating for a few months before I cheated on her and pretty much ghosted. I haven't seen her since.

Our mutual high school friend had coffee with her yesterday because they happened to be in the same city. He gossiped to me afterwards, naturally. She's doing well, which was good to hear. She did express that she hated how that year went, which wasn't surprising. However, the unexpected part: they did talk a fair bit about me, and she was actually really complimentary.

Apparently:

* She ""regrets"" that our relationship ended and wishes that she'd done better and that I'd understood that she was trying (this confused me, I really didn't think that much of it at the time)
* She said that she remembers me as a really nice guy and that I could be amazing, but that I'd also push buttons and could be an absolute dick. She expressed that ""you just have to accept him for who he is because he knows he's like that.""
* She asked about me, how I was doing, and whether I was seeing anyone (I think she was just curious lol)

I don't have any residual feelings for her (I haven't known her for over eight years), but I do feel weirdly bad after hearing all this-- almost makes me wish I'd been a little nicer!",0,1735530539.0,self,0,0.5,False

My car was starting to act up so I decided to make an appointment to visit a mechanic, had to drop off the car for 7 am. I woke up at 6:15 and realized I needed to rush. I made my coffee as I got dressed and upon finishing the coffee I got this heinous grumble. I ran to the bathroom and nuked the bowl, after it was over I checked and it was 6:50. I ran out of the house and got to the mechanics at 7:15, after a couple hours they called and told me that there was something digging into my tire and provided photos. After picking up the car I returned to work and got another grumble. While dealing with that I realized that while rushing to the mechanics I might've forgotten to clean the bowl and sent a text to my girlfriend "" hey so I had a wubby level shit and may have forgotten to clean the bowl because I was late to the mechanics, please try not to go in there until I get home so I can clean it"". After a couple minutes my phone notified me that I got a response but it wasn't my girlfriend. It was the mechanic. I had sent the text to him instead, his reply ""While we appreciate your punctuality, please clean the bowl before leaving"". I deleted the text and sat in this overwhelming feeling of shame. I told my girlfriend about everything and she died of laughter and informed me that I did infact clean the bowl before leaving.

1hpdyta,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpdyta,"my to be sister in law is driving me bonkers, any advice is GREATLY appreciated ","Me F(17) and my boyfriend M(17) have been together for a little over three years, first getting together start of 8th grade year. We’re both juniors in high school now. I have about 5 siblings and he only has 1 little sister which at the time of this post is F(14) and a freshman in high school. in the beginning of our relationship things were rocky between us, but me and his sister were really close. She got a power trip when i would get upset with him on her behalf and we would bond over that. About freshman year me and him realized something in our relationship wasn’t working out so we both dove deep into communication and self improvement. Along this 6 month- 1 year journey his grandparents on his mom’s side found out we were dating and did not approve. so his mom made us “break up” but we stayed together behind her back without any family (including his sister) knowing . our relationship was only getting stronger by the day with of course some slip ups here and there but overall everything was looking up. Sophomore year my previously single mom found someone and now by my junior year we plan to move. This would be detrimental to our relationship as he can not do long distance so we go to our last measures and he tells his mom we’ve been dating the entire time and asks if i can move in. he did it much smoother and nicer than im describing lol but after his mom has a small heart attack she decided to do a 2 week trial which went well and then now im moved in! i’ve been at their house for about 6 months now still visiting my house every weekend as an agreement to my mom letting me stay with his family. At first his sister was very upset, she’s not allowed to have a boyfriend but here’s her big brother with a whole girl in the house. but me and her bonded! not over toxic manipulation tactics against my poor boyfriend lol but over real stuff like makeup, and her curly journey, and that kind of thing. she is very clingy and over the top but i deal with it for my boyfriend and since i have 5 of my own siblings i have plenty of patience to spare. when i say over the top i mean she will get in my face and smack on her food, and look up at me thinking she’s cute and say “hi!” in a baby voice. she will PHYSICALLY throw herself on top of me and flop like a fish even if i ask her to move she will insist we’re “uhm-ing” um in vietnamese is hug. she used to have this habit that i unfortunately played into where she would stick out her index finger and go “FINGY?!!!! 🥺” as she’s asking me to hold her finger. that’s the only one i begin denying. Point is she is completely over the top. She does this to her poor mother as well. My boyfriend’s family is vietnamese, i come from a humble household, you say yes maam, yes sir, ALWAYA say thank you and excuse me, you never expect anything, and other BASIC MANNERS. i assumed his house ran the same way, i assumed so.. soo.. wrong. His sister will physically scream at her mother if her laundry is not done. i’ve witnessed it first hand! 
“mom did you do my sheets while i was at school?”
“oh sorry i forgot honey” 
“you said you’d wash my sheets..”
“i was busy im sorry ill wash them tomorrow”
“WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SLEEP ON?”
“(her name) i told you i was busy sorry” 
“great now i can’t lay on my bed because i have dirty clothes on from school and you forgot to wash my sheets. thanks. a. lot. mom.” 
she complains she has nothing to eat and will starve (she’s 5’0 and 220 pounds she won’t starve) i overheard her yell at her mom that she was putting her clothes in the wrong dresser while her MOM was putting HER clothes away?!? like!?! that is insane to me.  She is a crazy level of spoiled. And since i mentioned her weight, she has called me- 5’11 120lbs fat, she’s said i look pregnant, and she has called me PIGGY to my face. in. sane. one time she was upset and started ranting about how her family hates her and listed the worst events of her childhood. some of which were, being hit one time, (yes once) chasing her brother around with a broom stick, getting yelled at all the time, and having her aunties bitch at her. when i asked her if she ever seen her parents on drugs? no, has she ever seen them drunk? no, has she ever has to worry about weather or not her family could afford their next meal? no. mmm what about hand me downs? no!, one more example of her extreme spoiled-ness is her mom works as a care giver, these sweet older ladies will give her food they have from the food bank that they don’t want, and some of it happens to be good food like jello! or food that she likes like orange juice!, her mom brought home this food once and she was flabbergasted, “where’d you get the money for all this food mom?” 
“people at work gave it to me from the food bank! “
she then went on to complain about how they aren’t poor and how that’s disgusting and she won’t eat donation food, a day later upon seeing me open one of the chocolate jell-o pudding things and eating it she was APPALLLED, complete disbelief i would ever eat anything like that. and if your curious, they aren’t rich, they live in a 3 bedroom house, his dads beds in the living room,  (mom and dad sleep separate because his mom has a c-pap and it keeps his dad up if their in the same room) but it’s an overall ok neighborhood, i would comfortably say lower middle class - upper lower class, not ghetto, but right on that edge. My boyfriend dropped out within a month of our junior year to focus on work, his career is set up and he’s more than happy with what he does, i want to support him in any way possible so i’ve begun working with him. he works from 10am-12am (14 HOUR DAYS) as a head chef in a small restaurant his family owns, from 10-8:30 his aunties help run it, but from 9-12am i an the only server and he is the only cook.. while i work 3 hour days to support him while also balancing my running start, so high school and college classes, he works crazy hours for 6 days a week. his one day off he wants to spend as stress free as possible, his sister has a lonnnnngggg track record of bitching as you can probably tell. he gave her multiple chances before he kinda weened off hanging out with her on his one day off. since i’ve moved in and she sees us being happy, she, DREADS IT! at one point she cried to her parents about how my boyfriend opens her door and not mine and how on his birthday we went out to one of those fancy steakhouses where they bring you large things of meat and cut you off slices, did i mention on his birthday? and we didn’t invite her, but we had a separate dinner with all his family. she won’t accept leftover food, she gets upset when we bring her leftovers, but if we bring her home nothing she gets even more upset, saying we didn’t think about her. we have to bring her home a fresh meal if she knows we go out. forcing it takes away the thought behind it, completely. anyways she began to get jealous of our relationship and complains about me because of it.  i talked to her about it, finally the truth comes out, she wants to spend time with her brother, i tell her 1st i am not the enemy and i want her and her brother to spend time together and i know she can! if and only if she calms down on the bitching, i told her if she proves she’s at least trying we will bring her out more! then when it stops and he’s comfortable hanging out with her 1 on 1 again they can do so and i have 0 problem giving up me and my boyfriends one day off so he can spend it with his sister, but did she stop? no. the literal next week after we had this conversation she asked him to take her to ikea to get a desk but this day in particular we were supposed to drive downtown to visit our grandparents, both his and mine and we just didn’t really have time if we wanted to be punctual. we kindly explained this to her and she immediately call her mom (this is right after thank giving btw) and complained that she’s motivated TODAY of all days, and needs to re arrange her room in time for christmas because she’s going to get new shelving for christmas and needs to buy and put in a desk so she knows where the shelf can go. even after my boyfriend explains that we really don’t have time, his mom persists and he respects his mom and doesn’t want to cause his mom stress so after he picks me up from my 10:30am class we go straight to his house about 11 o clock we get there and immediately she starts screaming her ass off and complaining. i try and reason with her since we did just have that talk about a week ago after all and it didn’t matter, she slammed doors, she kicked the center console of my boyfriends car, she complained he was “30 minutes late” but he couldn’t have told her he was picking her up at 10:30 because he knew my class got out at that time, after all of that we didn’t even get a thank you. we repaired obviously but my boyfriend flat out refused to take her places because she refuses to calm down on every or any occasion. her jealousy begins to skyrocket and now she’s thinks her and her brother aren’t hanging out because i’m in the way. 

Now that the backstory is out of the way here’s where the meat of the story comes in. recently we all go snowboarding with her cousin who knows allot about snowboarding and gave us quick all quick lessons. my boyfriend tends to be independent but i am very much co dependent and need a buddy to calm my anxiety lol so we all agreed my boyfriend could go up and down as much as he likes while he figures it out without waiting for me and me and his sister would be learning buddies. on the drive there his two cousins drove and sat front seat, i voleneered middle and on the way there things were fine. she was super stoked for snow boarding she bought all her own gear and board and everything! and i was exited for her. i’m a board sport person, i paddle boars, surf board, boogey board, body board, i skateboard and longboard! so it was a matter of time till i figured out snowboarding. when i learned how to stand up my learning curve begun and like with every other board i’ve learned you fall, take advice, and get up and try again since me and his sister were buddies i did my best to give her advice as well as his cousin did, when the better knowing cousin would give advice like, try and lean back more, or learn to heel stop, or try falling on your butt, she would become a sore looser and make excuses and blatantly ignore the advice. i would do my best to be encouraging like i would go down first and tell her when i came back on the magic carpet what i learned, or i would say something uplifting like “i killed that!” and i would wait for her to go, i would say things like “woo that was a good one! now your turn!” and i would get attitude back like “im PUTTING my STRAPS on. 😒” in return so id go and come back up and encourage her to go again! and same thing “you go first it gives me courage” so id go then she’d go FINALLY and come back up and his cousin would give advice for her not to take. at one point of this cycle she asked us to record her so she could see what she was doing wrong, since she’s a 14 year old girl i made a joke saying “we’re giving you live advice no need to post your fails, we’ll record when you’re better” and also i just don’t want to drop anyone’s phone on the snow, i wasn’t calling her bad or anything but i knew she was gonna clip a part where she was doing good and post it and then probably stop trying. i wanted her to get it down, at this point she couldn’t get down the bunny hill without falling on her stomach and just refused advice so there was a lot of getting better she needed to do. anyways. on all of our last trip down the bunny hill i point out the easiest path that i found on my most recent board down, it has the least hills and bumps so probably the easiest to ride, considering i’ve learned to heel stop and almost do a 180° by now and she still can’t figure out how not to belly flop into the snow. i tell her my findings in hope she can get one good run! unfortunately this was met with “obviously i fucking know that” so i go down and wait for them. on the car ride back, all the sudden i was squishing her, did she tell me this? of course not! she scoots to the door as far as possible, i get the hint and i scoot toward my boyfriend, i even put one leg over his and ask the driver if i can put one foot on the center console, trying to make as much room as possible i put my elbows in my lap leaving my ribs exposed. little did i know this was my biggest mistake! every time the car would turn and i was pushed towards her because of gravity, she would jab her elbows into my ribs, im skinny, that shit hurts. and every time the car would veer the other way so she was leaning on me? her elbow RIGHT into my hips. as i’ve mentioned, i have not three, not four, but 5 siblings! i promise i can tell the difference between an accidental “re adjusting” elbow and a elbow that gets shoved further into my ribs the further the turn goes, even when we weren’t turning, her elbow still had pressure in my ribs, i’m much taller than her, i promise you if her shoulder was dropped her elbow wouldn’t be anywhere near my ribs. i stayed quiet. at the end of the ride before we get out she turns to me and asks “i think i was elbowing you, are good?” i just say yes and move on because i don’t start arguments in front of anyone who isn’t immediate family if not necessary. The next day i am BRUISED! i may have fair skin but i do NOT bruise easy. (picture attached) after i check this bruise, i decide we should talk about it because i don’t think that’s ok, i was looking for her to take accountability. she elbowed me on purpose, i didn’t even want an apology just a “i was upset last night my bad i was tweakin” would’ve beyond satisfied me. i walk into the dining room where she’s eating unaware her mom is around the corner in the kitchen, i pull up my shirt and show her my bruises, 
“(her name) look, you elbowed me  a lot last night in the car”
“i literally asked you if you were ok and you said yes  like.??” 
“it’s obvious that im not,”
her mom walks around the corner and looks at my bruise and asks if her daughter did this, mistakenly, i think she’s going to stand up for me so of course i say yes because that’s the truth. her mom just sits next to her silently as i tell her 
“(her name) listen you hurt me and-“
“ok how is that my fault i was literally half the fuck asleep what do you expect me to do” 
“i don’t appreciate you lying to me like this man i just want the truth” 
“ok but im literally not lying idk what you want me to say i was asleep and i literally asked you if you were ok and you said yes so like.” 
i walked away saying i just wanted accountability and soon after she makes everything about her, she begins complaining we weren’t helping her while we were snowboarding and how everyone left her and how she kept falling and it hurt “SO BAD MOM” and we made her look stupid when she asked for a video when we were all trying to give her in person tips and help, soon escalated to “(my boyfriends name) loves her more than me mom it’s not right!!! (video attached, turn volume up because they were in a different room with her door closed) anyways, i texted her on christmas 2 days after said event and 2 days of her ignoring me and she left me on delivered, (her read receipts are off and i know she seen my messsge)   so i text her again a few days later, again, nothing! today, a sunday my boyfriend wants to go to church for the first time in a long time and she comes with, she is in a good mood and we went to the gym after with her still trying to ignore me but slowly weaving into conversations, we got food before my boyfriend was off to work and while we were eating i turned to her and said “i’ll give you 3 options! 1. we text about it 2. we talk about it or 3. you take accountability and we move on” i said those exact words and she storms off saying she has to take a shit then mumbles uber her breath “text but it’s not even that deep but whatever” so finally she texts me! not good. she immediately try’s to play victim and guilt trip me, i’ll let the texts speak from themselves (attached), 

screenshots are in order of the story 

when i said im sorry i ruined your breakfast, i was referring to the day i confronted her, while screaming, she mentioned i ruined her breakfast so i apologized. 

i did nothing in the morning for her to go to work angry, literally, nothing. im not leaving anything out, what i said was word for word, and that was the end of our interaction for the day, i don’t know what upset her so much and i don’t know how it’s my fault somehow 

the day she cried wolf about me being the devil pretty much i tried to talk to her mom, she was making up lies and i wanted to make sure if his sister doesn’t like me, fine but his mom’s opinion means a lot to me. so i wanted to set bases straight she thankfully knew her daughter was lying and it seems thankfully her son told her my story and everything before her daughters lies filled her head; but when i talked to her mom she asked for my help, saying i need to be the leader since im more mature and she wants her daughter to have the right guidance, that’s the main reason i tried to solve our problem with a 3 step method, i would try to solve it normally without the influence of her mom but i just took an approach that her mom asked me too instead. 

i did get petty at the end with the happy face but i am so exhausted of her walking all over me all. the. time. i’m a people pleaser and really need some advice 

reddit, please help me, what do i do?!

I am after some advice on what to do moving forward with my home electrical and my electrician suggested talking to an electrical engineer. 

I have a 380m2, 5,2,3 home with 8 zone ducted and 5kw solar attached in Ipswich QLD. Our bill is IVO $1200 a quarter WITHOUT the 3 new additions below. The solar works, but may need a service. 

I'm getting in the next few months;
1. food trailer powered by 15amp for lights, 3 deep fryers, exhaust fan and 2 pump coffee machine. 
2. 6x4m pool with pump, 2 lights and heater
3. A BYD Sealion 6 Premium (PHEV).

My questions are;
1. Do I need an engineer to begin with?
2. How do I get the right electrical engineer to ensure the home can power all appliances safely and economically?
3. I want to be able to use power economically, reduce my power bill as much as possible, whilst ensuring I can charge my car, and use the trailer for maintenance, training and some operations.

What's the advice from the brains trust? Happy for PMs as well.

## Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker: Easy Brewing, Smart Features, 2025 Review

In today's fast-paced world, convenience is king.  This is especially true in the morning, when even the simplest tasks can feel like a monumental effort.  For coffee lovers, this means a coffee maker that doesn't just brew a great cup, but also integrates seamlessly into their busy lives. The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker aims to do just that, offering a blend of ease of use, smart features, and reliable performance.  This review will delve into its key features, user experience, and overall value, helping you decide if it's the right smart coffee maker for you.

## Effortless Brewing: Key Features for the Modern Coffee Lover

The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker isn't just another coffee machine; it's a connected brewing experience designed to simplify your morning routine. Several key features contribute to its user-friendly design and smart capabilities:

### **1. Voice Control with Alexa: Your Voice, Your Coffee**

One of the standout features is its seamless integration with Alexa.  Imagine this: you wake up, still groggy, and with a simple voice command, """"Alexa, start my coffee,"""" your brew begins.  No fumbling with buttons or screens in the pre-dawn darkness.  The possibilities extend beyond simply starting the brewing process. You can also control brew strength (""""Alexa, set brew strength to bold""""), check the water level (though this isn't explicitly a feature, the app can help with this), or even create custom routines for a perfectly timed cup every morning.  This level of voice control significantly enhances convenience, particularly for those with busy mornings or limited mobility.  Compatible Alexa devices include the Echo Plus, Echo Dot, Echo Spot, and Echo Show.

### **2. Front-Fill Water Reservoir: Effortless Refilling**

Frustrated with awkwardly maneuvering your coffee maker to fill the water reservoir?  The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker addresses this common pain point with its innovative front-fill design.  This allows you to easily add water without having to remove the machine from under your cabinets, a significant improvement over traditional top-fill models. This seemingly small design choice significantly enhances usability and efficiency, making the daily refill a breeze.

### **3. Customizable Brew Strength: Tailor Your Taste**

Whether you prefer a gentle, mild brew or a robust, bold cup, the Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker caters to your preferences. It offers both regular and bold brew strength options, allowing you to adjust the intensity of your coffee to your liking.  You can easily switch between these settings via the Alexa app or manually on the machine itself. This customization ensures that every cup is brewed to perfection, tailored to your individual taste.

### **4. Drip-Free Carafe: Spill-Free Serving**

Accidents happen, and coffee spills are never fun. The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker mitigates this risk with its drip-free carafe design.  The carefully engineered spout prevents messy drips and spills, ensuring a clean and efficient pouring experience. This simple yet effective feature contributes to a more enjoyable overall coffee-making experience.


## Smart Home Integration and Connectivity

The true power of the Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker lies in its seamless integration with your smart home ecosystem.

### **1. Alexa Compatibility: A Smart Home Essential**

As mentioned, the coffee maker's compatibility with Alexa devices is a major selling point.  This integration extends beyond simple voice commands.  You can create custom routines within the Alexa app, scheduling your coffee to brew automatically at a specific time. Imagine waking up to the delightful aroma of freshly brewed coffee – perfectly timed to greet you.  This feature alone makes it a highly desirable addition for any tech-savvy coffee lover.

### **2. Alexa Routines: Automate Your Morning**

The ability to create custom routines within the Alexa app is a game-changer.  You can program the coffee maker to start brewing at a specific time each morning, ensuring your coffee is ready when you are.  This is particularly useful for those who value consistency and efficiency in their daily routines.  You could even link it to other smart home devices, creating a fully automated wake-up sequence.


## Ease of Use and Maintenance: Designed for Simplicity

Beyond its smart features, the Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker prioritizes ease of use and maintenance.

### **1. Automatic Shutoff: Safety and Convenience**

Safety is paramount, and the automatic shutoff feature provides peace of mind.  After two hours of brewing, the coffee maker automatically shuts off, preventing potential accidents and energy waste. This safety feature is crucial, especially for those who might forget to turn off their appliances.

### **2. Cleaning Cycle Reminder: Keep It Clean, Keep It Brewing**

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining optimal performance and flavor.  The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker features a cleaning cycle reminder, displayed as the word """"clean"""" on the machine.  This simple yet effective reminder helps prevent buildup and ensures your coffee always tastes its best.


## User Testimonials and Reviews: Real-World Experiences

While specifications and features are important, real-world experiences offer the most insightful perspective.  Numerous online reviews highlight the coffee maker's ease of use and efficiency.  Many users praise the convenience of voice control, particularly for busy mornings.  One satisfied customer stated, """"This coffee maker has completely changed my mornings!  Being able to just say 'Alexa, brew coffee' is a game-changer.""""  Such testimonials emphasize the positive impact of the smart features on daily routines.

## Technical Specifications and Availability

The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker boasts a 12-cup capacity, ensuring enough coffee for the entire household or a few days of individual brewing.  Brew time is efficient, typically around 10 minutes depending on the selected brew strength.  It's officially """"Works with Alexa Certified,"""" guaranteeing compatibility and reliability.  Check the manufacturer's website for the most up-to-date information on availability and potential shipping delays.


## Conclusion: The Smart Choice for Coffee Lovers

The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker seamlessly blends convenience, smart technology, and reliable performance. Its voice control, front-fill water reservoir, customizable brew strength, and smart home integration are major selling points for those seeking a hassle-free coffee experience.  While the price point may be slightly higher than traditional coffee makers, the added convenience and smart features justify the investment for tech-savvy individuals who value efficiency and a seamless morning routine.

1hpdx85,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hpdx85/i_was_forced_to_watch_my_own_funeral/,I was forced to watch my own funeral,"I need to write this down before my hands fade completely. The marks on my skin spread a little more each hour, and the mirror shows less of my face every time I look. My friends think I came back from Hollow Hills Cemetery unchanged. They have no idea they’ve been talking to something wearing my skin.

The cheap clock behind Mickey’s Diner counter read eleven fifteen when everything went wrong. Rain pelted the windows, turning the neon signs outside into blurry halos. My friends and I huddled in our usual booth, the torn leather seats sticky against my legs. The place smelled like burnt coffee and yesterday’s grease, but it beat going home to an empty house.

My coffee had long gone cold, and a half-eaten plate of fries sat forgotten between us. Chris dominated the conversation as usual, his varsity jacket taking up too much space in the booth. He lived for these late-night sessions, swapping urban legends between bites of food he never paid for.

Chris asked, “You guys ever hear about the Forgotten Ritual?”

The fluorescent light above our booth flickered, casting strange shadows across his face.

“Not this again,” Megan said. She pulled her sleeve over a fresh bruise on her arm—another gift from her stepdad.

Chris leaned forward. “No, listen. My cousin’s friend went out to Hollow Hills Cemetery last month. He never came back right.”

The jukebox in the corner skipped, repeating the same three notes of an old country song.

“What do you mean, never came back right?” I asked.

“Old man Peters found him wandering the grounds at dawn,” Chris said. “The guy kept talking about empty coffins and funeral setups appearing out of nowhere. Said the chairs were filled with things wearing people suits.”

My stomach twisted. “Things?” I asked.

Megan said, “Faceless things. My sister told me about this. The ritual calls people in at midnight. They find this creepy funeral, and then...”

“And then what?” I asked.

“They become part of the audience,” Chris said. “Every time someone new walks in, the chairs are filled with these faceless creatures in rotting funeral clothes. But there’s always one empty chair, waiting for the next idiot who doesn’t listen to the warnings.”

Thunder cracked outside. The diner’s lights dimmed for a moment, and my reflection in the window looked odd.

“You’re making this up,” I said. A drop of cold sweat ran down my back.

Chris pulled out his phone. “Peters swears he’s found fresh funeral setups out there. Look at these pictures. Empty coffins just sitting in the grass, surrounded by all these old wooden chairs.”

The photos on his phone showed blurry shapes in the darkness. Black flowers scattered on wet grass. Something that might have been a coffin.

“Those could be anything,” I said. But my hands shook as I pushed his phone away.

Chris said, “Prove us wrong, then. Go out there tonight. Take some better pictures.”

The diner’s ancient heating system groaned. Cold air leaked through the windows, and goosebumps rose on my arms.

“I’ll do it,” I said. The words left my mouth before I could stop them.

“Jacob, we were just messing around. Don’t be stupid,” Megan said.

I stood up from the booth. “No, you want proof? I’ll get it.” The linoleum floor seemed to tilt under my feet.

“Some stories should stay stories,” Megan said.

Chris reached for my arm. His face had lost its usual smirk. “Seriously, man. I was just talking shit. Don’t go out there.”

I yanked away from him. “Text me the directions. I’ll show you there’s nothing in that cemetery except old graves and your crazy stories.”

The bell above the diner door chimed as I pushed outside. Rain soaked through my jacket immediately. The moon hung low and bloated in the sky, surrounded by clouds that looked like grasping hands.

A dog howled somewhere in the distance. The sound echoed off empty streets and dark houses, mixing with the rain.

I had no idea I’d just accepted an invitation to my own funeral.

The rain pounded against my windshield as I drove down Miller Road. My phone’s GPS kept losing signal, the screen flickering between Chris’s texted directions and static. The streetlights ended at the town limits, leaving only my headlights to cut through the darkness.

My hands gripped the steering wheel tighter at each turn. The radio picked up nothing but white noise, a strange buzz that rose and fell like whispered voices. Even turning it off didn’t help—the sound continued through my car’s speakers, growing louder as I approached Hollow Hills.

A rusted sign marked the turnoff to the cemetery. The metal had corroded into strange patterns, but the warning remained clear: NO ENTRY AFTER DARK. My headlights caught something moving behind the sign. A shadow darted into the trees, too quick to identify.

“Just a deer,” I said. My voice sounded shrill in the confined space of my car.

The dirt road wound through dense woods. Branches scraped against my car’s roof like fingernails on metal. Each curve revealed more warning signs, their messages growing stranger, like: “TURN BACK,” “THEY ARE WAITING,” and “THE RITUAL MUST BE FED.”

The clock on my dashboard read eleven forty-five. The numbers flickered, sometimes showing different times. My phone died despite being fully charged at the diner.

An old church appeared through the trees, its steeple askew and windows dark. The stone walls had turned black with age and something else—strange symbols carved into every surface. My headlights swept across the entrance, illuminating a figure in the doorway. It wore what might have been a priest’s collar, but its face...

I blinked and the figure vanished. The church sat empty, though the doorway seemed darker than the surrounding night.

“This is stupid,” I said. My breath fogged the windshield in strange patterns.

The cemetery gates rose ahead, wrought iron twisted into shapes that hurt my eyes. The main entrance stood open, hinges creaking in a wind I couldn’t feel. My headlights caught rows of tombstones, their surfaces writhing with shadows.

A group of crows perched on a nearby mausoleum. Their heads turned in unison to watch my car pass, but their bodies remained perfectly still. One opened its beak in a silent scream.

The service road ended at a circular parking area. Gravel crunched under my tires as I pulled in, the sound too loud in the unnatural silence. Other tire tracks marked the gravel, but they all led in. None led out.

I grabbed my flashlight from the glove compartment. The beam looked weak against the darkness, barely reaching the nearest headstones. Names and dates blurred together on the stones, sometimes changing when I looked back at them.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. Impossible—it had died minutes ago. The screen showed a message from an unknown number:

“Welcome to your funeral. Please be seated.”

The clock struck eleven fifty-five. From deeper in the cemetery came the sound of chairs being arranged and a coffin lid creaking open.

The beam of my flashlight trembled across weathered headstones. My footsteps crunched on dead leaves, each sound echoing longer than it should have. The path ahead wound between ancient oak trees, their branches forming a tunnel that blocked out what little moonlight remained.

A crow called from somewhere in the darkness. The sound repeated from different directions, multiplying until it surrounded me. The birds remained invisible, but their wings brushed against my face and neck. My flashlight beam caught only empty branches.

The path opened into a circular clearing. My light swept across rows of wooden chairs arranged in a semi-circle, their surfaces black with age and rot. Dead flowers covered the ground—roses and lilies turned the color of old blood. Their petals spread out in precise patterns, forming symbols I recognized from the church walls.

In the center of it all sat the coffin.

The wood gleamed as if freshly polished, reflecting my flashlight beam. Brass handles lined its sides, each one carved with faces frozen in screams. The lid sat slightly ajar, a thin line of darkness beckoning.

“This isn’t real,” I said. My words hung in the air like frost.

A chair creaked behind me. I spun around, but the seats remained empty. Another creak came from the opposite side. Then another. The sounds moved through the semicircle as if invisible people were taking their seats.

The temperature dropped. My breath clouded in front of my face, forming shapes that looked almost like words. The flashlight flickered, its beam growing weaker.

My feet carried me toward the coffin against my will. Each step brought me closer to that thin gap between lid and base. A sweet, cloying smell rose from inside—like funeral flowers mixed with decay.

The lid moved on its own, opening wider. My flashlight beam caught something inside, and I stumbled back. My own face stared up at me, pale and peaceful as if in sleep. The body wore a black suit I’d never owned, hands folded over its chest.

“This is impossible,” I said. 

My voice cracked.

The thing in the coffin opened its eyes.

Its head turned toward me with a motion too smooth to be natural. My own eyes stared back. But they were too dark, too deep, like holes leading somewhere else. Its lips pulled back in a smile that stretched too wide for a human face.

Movement caught my attention. The empty chairs weren’t empty anymore. Figures sat in each one, wearing moth-eaten funeral clothes from different eras. Their heads turned in unison to watch me, but where their faces should have been... nothing. Just smooth, blank skin stretched over skull-like features.

“Welcome to your funeral,” the thing with my face said. Its voice matched mine exactly.

My flashlight died. The moon emerged from behind the clouds, casting everything in a sickly blue light. The faceless audience leaned forward in their chairs.

The copy of me sat up in the coffin, its movements jerky like a puppet on strings. Its suit remained perfectly pressed despite the motion. A drop of something dark rolled down its chin.

“The ritual requires a trade,” it said. “A fair exchange of flesh and memory.”

My legs wouldn’t move. The faceless figures rose from their chairs, their bodies twitching and bending. They formed a circle around me and the coffin, their blank faces somehow conveying hunger.

“Your seat awaits,” my double said. It pointed to the one empty chair in the circle.

The faceless ones reached for me with too-long fingers. Their touch burned cold through my clothes. They began to sing in voices that sounded like static and screaming combined.

The coffin lid opened wider, a rectangle of absolute darkness against the night. My double’s smile stretched until it split its face, revealing rows of teeth that glinted like polished bone.

“Time to take your place in the audience,” it said.

The faceless ones pulled me toward the coffin. Their grips tightened until I could feel bone grinding against bone. The copy of me stood up, its movements becoming more natural with each passing second as mine grew stiffer.

In the distance, a clock began to strike midnight. With each chime, another piece of my reflection faded in my double’s eyes, replaced by something ancient and hungry.

The ritual had begun.

The faceless ones dragged me toward the coffin. Their fingers burned like ice through my clothes, leaving trails of numbness across my skin. My muscles refused to obey as my body grew stiffer with each passing second.

My double stepped out of the coffin with unnatural grace. Each movement became more fluid, more natural—more like mine. It straightened its black suit and ran its fingers through its hair in a perfect mirror of my own habit.

“The transition has already begun,” my copy said. Its voice had changed, gaining warmth and personality while mine grew hollow.

The faceless audience swayed in their circle around us. Their blank faces twisted and rippled as if something moved beneath the skin. A low hum rose from their throats, discordant notes that made my teeth ache.

“Stop fighting,” my double said. Blood trickled from the corner of its mouth. “Each struggle only feeds the ritual.”

The moon cast strange shadows through the trees. My reflection in the coffin’s polished surface grew fainter as my copy’s image grew stronger. The numbness spread up my arms and into my chest.

One of the faceless ones pressed something into my hand—a small book bound in what looked like human skin. The pages fell open to reveal spidery text written in dried blood:

“The chosen must surrender flesh and form. The audience must grow. The pattern must continue.”

“Give in,” my double said. Its smile revealed teeth filed to points. “The empty chair awaits.”

The faceless ones pulled me closer to the chair. Their bodies bent, heads twisting completely around to watch with their blank faces. The wood creaked under their grip, the surface writhing with carved symbols.

A crow landed on the chair’s back. Its eyes glowed red in the moonlight, and its beak opened to reveal human teeth.

“Your seat has been prepared,” the bird said in a voice like grinding bones.

My copy walked around the circle, touching each faceless one on their blank features. Where its fingers passed, the skin rippled and faces began to form—all of them mine, from different ages and times.

“Past versions,” my double said. “Each one thought they could resist. Each one became part of the pattern.”

The numbness reached my neck. My voice came out distorted. “Why me?”

My copy’s face split into that too-wide grin. “The ritual chooses those who will make the best audience. The ones who understand the perfect horror of watching others fall into the same trap.”

The faceless ones pushed me into the chair. Wood groaned beneath me as the carved symbols began to glow with a sickly green light. Roots burst from the ground, wrapping around my legs and arms.

“The process has begun,” my double said. It pulled out my phone—my phone—and checked the screen. “Your friends will be missing you soon. I should get back to the diner.”

The roots tightened, pulling me deeper into the chair. My skin began to ripple and stretch, turning blank and smooth like the others. Memories flashed behind my eyes—my life, my family, my identity all being stripped away.

My copy straightened its tie and cleared its throat. It spoke in my voice, practicing: “Sorry guys, nothing out there. Just old graves and stories.”

The faceless ones swayed faster, their humming growing louder. Each note tore away another piece of my humanity. The book in my hand grew warm, its pages filling with my own story written in fresh blood.

The last chime of midnight echoed through the cemetery. My double walked away, its movements a perfect copy of mine. It would go back to my life, live in my skin, while I...

I became part of the audience. The perfect witness to the horror. The ritual had claimed another observer for its eternal pattern.

And somewhere in the distance, I could already hear the next victim approaching through the cemetery gates.

The roots burrowed deeper into my flesh. Each tendril carved new patterns under my skin, rewriting me from the inside out. The chair creaked as it absorbed me into its ancient wood. My bones shifted and cracked, rearranging themselves into a new shape.

My double paused at the edge of the clearing. Its footsteps crunched on dead flowers as it turned back to watch my transformation. The moonlight caught its face—my face—but the features had already begun to change. Its skin looked fresher, younger. The dark circles under its eyes faded while mine deepened into hollow pits.

“The change will be complete by dawn,” my copy said. A crow landed on its shoulder, talons digging into the suit jacket. “Your friends won’t notice the difference. They never do.”

The faceless audience pressed closer. Their blank features rippled with remembered agony. One reached out and pressed its palm against my cheek. Images flooded my mind—memories of other transformations, other victims, other nights in this clearing.

“Let me show you what you’ll become,” the thing wearing my face said.

The world twisted. Reality peeled back like old wallpaper, revealing the truth beneath. I watched my double return to the diner in my car. The scene played out like a movie:

Chris looked up from his phone. “Find anything out there?”

“Nothing but old graves,” my copy said. It slid into the booth with perfect casualness. “You guys were just trying to scare me.”

Megan’s eyes narrowed. Something in her recognized the oddness, but the thought slipped away before it could form.

The vision shifted. Days passed in seconds. I watched my double take over my life, speak with my voice, smile with my face. But small things changed. Its movements grew more predatory. Its eyes gleamed with ancient hunger when no one looked directly at it.

More victims came to the clearing. My copy guided them here with whispered stories and subtle manipulations. The audience grew. The pattern continued.

Back in the clearing, my skin had begun to smooth over. My features melted like wax, leaving behind a blank canvas. The roots pulsed with each beat of my fading heart.

“Your turn approaches,” my double said. Its grin stretched wider than human bones should allow. “The next one comes tonight. A girl who heard stories of the cemetery. She’ll need a proper audience.”

The faceless ones swayed in their eternal dance. Their bodies bent and twisted with immortal patience. I tried to scream but my mouth had already sealed over, leaving only smooth skin.

My phone lay in the dead flowers where my copy had dropped it. The screen lit up with a text from Megan:

“Something’s wrong with the Jacob who came back.”

But her realization came too late. The roots claimed the last of my humanity. My bones settled into their new configuration—an eternal witness trapped in this clearing. My body fused with the chair as my mind expanded to join the others.

The crow spread its wings and screamed a human scream. Dawn crept over the horizon, painting the cemetery in shades of blood. My double walked away wearing my life like a new suit, leaving me to wait in the audience.

The book of skin and blood dropped from my nerveless fingers. Its pages filled with my story, adding to the record of all who had come before. The ritual had claimed another observer, another piece of its growing pattern.

In the distance, a car’s headlights swept the cemetery gates. A new victim approached, drawn by whispered stories and midnight dares. The audience stirred in their chairs, blank faces turning toward the sound.

The show was about to begin again.

Time moved differently in the clearing. Each night stretched into an eternity of waiting. Our chairs creaked in perfect unison as new victims approached. The audience never tired, never aged, never looked away. We existed only to witness.

A year passed in the world outside. My double lived my life with inhuman precision. It wore my skin and spoke with my voice, but small changes crept in. My friends drifted away one by one. Their instincts warned them something was off even as their minds refused to understand.

Megan lasted the longest. Her text messages to my old phone grew more desperate:

“You’ve changed.”

“This isn’t you anymore.”

“What happened in the cemetery?”

The thing wearing my face deleted each message with a smile. Its fingers left frost on the phone screen.

Our clearing drew more victims. A teenage boy on a dare. A woman investigating local legends. A paranormal researcher with cameras and equipment. Each one found the funeral waiting. Each one joined our ranks.

The transformations grew more elaborate. The ritual learned from each victim, refined its methods. The roots dug deeper. The pattern expanded.

I memorized every detail of our prison. The chairs arranged in a perfect circle, each one carved from wood older than human civilization. The symbols hidden in the grain shifted and changed with each viewing. Dead flowers covered the ground in patterns similar to the ones etched into our bones.

My double returned on the anniversary of my transformation. Frost spread across the grass with each step as it entered our clearing. Its movements had grown more fluid, more predatory. My old face had become a mask it wore with practiced ease.

“The pattern grows stronger,” it said. Its voice echoed with the sounds of other stolen lives. “Each witness adds to our collection.”

The faceless audience turned as one to watch it pass. Our blank features rippled with shared memory. The thing wearing my skin touched each chair, trailing ice crystals in its wake.

“Your contributions have been invaluable,” my copy said. “The horror in their eyes when they recognize a friend in the audience... exquisite.”

A new victim’s car pulled into the cemetery. Headlights swept across ancient tombstones as tires crunched on gravel. The engine died with a final sputter.

“Right on schedule,” my double said. A crow landed on its shoulder, its beak filled with human teeth. “She’s been asking questions about her missing brother—the paranormal researcher who joined you last month.”

The audience straightened in their chairs. Our bodies creaked and contorted as we prepared for the show. The ritual demanded perfect witnesses.

My copy adjusted its tie and smiled. “I’ll leave you to your duties. The pattern must be maintained.”

It walked away, frost melting in its footsteps. The crow spread its wings and screamed with my original voice—the last piece of humanity the ritual had stripped away.

Footsteps approached through the cemetery. A flashlight beam bounced between headstones, drawing closer to our clearing. The coffin lid creaked open as roots stirred beneath the earth.

The book of skin and blood appeared in my lap. Its pages turned by themselves, making space for a new story. The audience leaned forward in their chairs, blank faces eager for the next performance.

A young woman stepped into our clearing. Her flashlight beam caught the funeral setup, the waiting coffin, the circle of faceless watchers. Recognition dawned in her eyes as she stared at my chair.

“Jacob?” she asked. “Is that you?”

1hpdtrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hpdtrq/seeking_advice_on_supporting_my_partner_through/,Seeking advice on supporting my partner through her weight journey/challenges (currently on Ozempic),"I’m reaching out for guidance on how to support my partner (F32) as she navigates challenges with her weight and self-esteem. We’ve been together for 14 years, and throughout this time, her weight has fluctuated from a size 8 to a size 18. While her physical appearance has never been a concern for me, her relationship with her body and self-image has significantly impacted our relationship.

Background:

	•	Early Struggles: Since childhood, she has battled with weight and comfort eating, often stemming from internalized bullying and a challenging household environment.

•	Current Situation: She is medically classified as obese and has recently started using Ozempic to assist with weight loss. While this has altered her eating habits, I worry that without addressing the underlying psychological aspects, she may continue to struggle with self-acceptance.

	•	Mental Health: She has a history of low self-esteem, often comparing herself unfavorably to others and expressing feelings of unworthiness.

Challenges:

•	Exercise: Joint attempts at physical activity have been inconsistent. She avoids the gym due to fear of judgment and is inconsistent exercising at home.

•	Therapy: A recent two-month stint in therapy yielded limited progress, possibly due to difficulties in opening up about deeply personal issues.

•	Diet: Despite generally healthy eating habits, preferences for high-calorie additions (e.g., sugary coffee, dressing-laden salads, desserts) increase her overall intake.

•	Medication Perception: She views reliance on Ozempic as a personal failure, expressing embarrassment about needing medical assistance for weight loss.

My Perspective:

I firmly believe that the core issue lies in her mindset rather than her physical appearance. Her negative self-perception, constant comparisons, and internalized stigma towards weight are barriers to her well-being. I’ve attempted to reassure her by emphasizing:

1.	Lack of External Judgment: Her weight loss journey is personal, and she isn’t obligated to disclose methods to others.

2.	Compassion Towards Self: Needing assistance, whether medical or otherwise, is not a failure but a step towards health.

3.	Contextual Challenges: Her upbringing and societal factors have contributed to her relationship with food, making change particularly challenging.

4.	Medical Perspective: Obesity and related behaviors are medical issues; seeking help is akin to treating any other health condition.

5.	Societal Norms: Her experiences are more common than she perceives, and many face similar challenges.

Acknowledging my (perceived) biggest limitation:

I grew up in a household with an emotionally distant single parent. And what I consider “tough love”. Respect through fear of violence and love through acts of service and gift giving. In a way I feel incompatible with my partner who favours, physically contact and mostly words of encouragement. Things I don’t feel I’m naturally good at. Due in part to growing up feeling like these things aren’t necessary to show love. 

Request for Advice:

Even if my partner reaches her intended weight. I can see her forming some negative mental models around this change which will hinder the enjoyment she will have by reaching her weight goals. I’m seeking strategies to help her develop a healthier self-image and mindset, including:

•	Effective Communication: How can I discuss these sensitive topics without causing defensiveness or further harm to her self-esteem?

•	Encouraging Self-Compassion: What approaches can foster self-acceptance and reduce negative self-comparisons?

•	Supporting Without Pressuring: How can I be a supportive partner without imposing or making her feel judged?

•	Promoting Positive Body Image: Are there specific activities that can aid in improving her perception of herself?

I appreciate any insights or experiences you can share that might assist me in supporting her through this journey.

Thank you for your support.

Going back to her hometown

I 30M and my ex 26F broke up 2 months ago. At the time we were living in her town for around 7 months. And we had been together for 2 years. 1year and 3 months BF&GF. 
We broke up and I felt overwhelmed and decided to go back to my town to start therapy, work on myself and to give distance to the break up. 

I have another post explaining more about the break up. 

Long story short, we had been in contact during this two months. Mostly started by her. We had spoke about the reasons why we broke up. But still we both care a lot about the other and the feelings of love and longing are clear. We chat, we laugh and support each other. 

One week ago I told her that I’m coming back to her town to re start my life. Work, hobbies, friends and of course to see her. I really like that place and my life there. So going back is my choice even over what could happen with her. 

She was really receptive about it, and happy that I’m going back. She literally said that she wants to meet up the moment I arrive so we can go for a coffee beers or whatever. 

I think, even I’m doing this because I grow to really like that place and that feels as home, I would really like for something to happen between us. 

I don’t really know why I’m writing this. It’s maybe to vent, to see if someone got some advice or even just to put into words what is on my mind.

the mornings were slow,
like the sun knew
we needed the time
coffee curling in the air,
your scent of Santal
lingering like a soft secret
on the sheets,
and me,
just watching you.

your blue eyes
held me captive,
a quiet kind of chaos,
and when you smiled,
it felt like surrender,
like there was no war left
worth fighting.

the current of your touch,
electric, undeniable,
pulling me closer
on bike rides,
down streets that never mattered
because you were there,
and the world
was only ever you.

I’ll never forget
Tulum—
the stars spilling across the sky,
our mouths colliding like waves,
your kiss,
raw and unrelenting,
making me believe
the universe was ours to hold.

and the way we made love
there are no words.
it was fire and gravity,
a pull so strong
the world disappeared.
every touch, every kiss,
every breath
a language only we could speak,
a universe only we could create.

those nights
our bodies telling stories
that time could never erase.
it was always you,
Arielle.
only you.

I will miss the mornings,
the laughter,
the ache,
the way you loved me
as if you didn’t know how to stop.

and now,
I’m the one
trying to forget
what it felt like
to wake up next to forever.

I'm 12mths sober but life's already ruined, alcholol took everything away from me and still is even though im 12mths sober, its over health wise

Sorry for long post, liquid diet, innafective swallowing 90%, motility problems dysphagia dysfunctional osphogus weak les ues, non stop regurgitation liquid 24 7, bile reflux, gastritis induced by alcholol.

No reason to live really tbh, partly disabled due to alcholol I think,  had a bit troubled life full of abuse, as kid from 6 to 17  not sure what I've done to deserve this though I've been putting in hard work to better my health but I get so many health problems day in day out for 8mths before I wasn't to bad tbh. 😞

Spending Christmas alone is heart breaking

 12mths sober but still so many health problems, basicallyvdisabled, its  spending 3rd Christmas alone my heart breaks , the reason it's like this is alcholol is what's done this, going from a caring mum for 9yrs to son his 11 now to a pathetic looser who became a alchololic and totally changed , can't understand but I Waa a beautiful caring mum that always took my son out for 9 yrs to this drinking  animal in last 3mths of living with ex of 22 yrs in house separated under 1 roof. Shame on me & couldn't get it together for 2yrs in 22, 23.

I feel totally helpless and distraught as to how &  why I got myself into this position,  anyone else spending it alone? I can't eat solids cause of gerd and iem and gasostropies,  i have rheumatoid arthritis, stenosis, spondylitis lithesis c3,4,5,6 disc bulge c5c6 mild scoliosis cervical mylopathy osteoporosis, my neck is completely locked up and stooped forward i cant move it whatsoever and struggle to walk & unbalanced that's made me isolate myself for 12mths. I've been to many drs gastroentolgist and endoscopy and other procedures,

 i need 4 more test which ive had a yr sgo to really get to the bottom of every thing and hopefully can get surgery,  poem or flouriscopic robotic surgery or fundoplication including fusion surgery in india as Australia is to expensive,  I cannot eat solids for 6mths so far and it's even worse I cannot do anything for Christmas.not thatci have for 2yrs due to been situated in shared house that was nice but not the best environment, Pretty much I've isolated myself for 12mths now anyway only going to drs and emergency departments but to spend  Christmas new yrs alone is going to be a kick in the teeth, anyone going to be spending it alone? Everything I eat I'm chewing and liquid goes into ny mouth while chewing and I try to swallow it down with all this liquid them it back flows back up so bizarre as I never had this problem, I don't even get bad reflux it's just motility of stomach osphogus gallbladder but it's 24 7 of hell! Alcholol took everything away from me & I let it happen,

I’m mostly looking for advice on what furniture to get and the size. This is our primary (only) living room that you walk into from the front door. We don’t entertain a lot, but we do have some company. 

Having couches across from each other leaves about 4’ to walk to the fireplace, so no room for a coffee table. An L shaped couch is okay, but it doesn’t feel right. We both use the recliners most often, so a couch and / or love seat would need to recline if recliners are not a part of the new plan.

You tip for good service not bc someone did their job. And standard has always been servers only and 10-20% idk why 20% is now the expected bare minimum and for literally every job. 
Ex. retail: I will not tip you if I wasn’t helped “Can I help you today?” “No thank you I’m ok” is different from “Excuse me can you help me” “sure here’s what you were looking for and my opinions on what would look good etc.” They’re different.
Ex. servers: please tip your servers just because. Job description alone is to take orders and bring out food everything else is service and that is what you tip for. Good service is making adjustments and accommodations before the customer asks (high chairs, special seating for disabilities making sure everybody else did their job right before it impacts the customer etc). Goof servers have recommendations and intentionally make good conversation. Tip for these things
Ex. non-serving food service: a lot of these industries have newly mandatory tipping screens. You literally have to click any button to continue with the transaction. While tips are greatly appreciated if they did nothing more than take an order/hand you food there’s no reason to. Coffee shops tend to give opinions and explain options so tipping in that aspect makes sense.
Ex. delivery drivers: idc what yall say im only tipping if you had to go through nonsense to make the delivery. Prime-time traffic and weather conditions call for tips but under no circumstances does making the delivery owe you tips. Delivering the stuff intact, untampered, and within reasonable time is the bare minimum. Tips are appreciated but stop standardizing it.
Ex. drivers: tip when they make good conversation, have amenities, do special stuff. Driving people safely is bare minimum. A good way to determine tips is to start high and take off for speeding, recklessness, rudeness etc.

All this to say tipping is a show of appreciation. Customers, tip because it’s nice and tip when people go out of their way. Service ppl, stop demanding tips and make ppl want to tip you instead.

It begins when a father buys a gun to protect his family against the wife's objections. They fight about it but the wife allows the gun to stay. While at work, their son (around 5-6) finds the gun in the bedroom night stand. The mom sees her son with it, grabs the gun and takes her son and the gun out and she throws the gun out the window.

The movie cuts to a drifter walking down the road and finds the gun. He puts the pistol in his waist band and continues to walk into town. There he goes to a diner and buys a cup of coffee. I guess he's well known because the waitress calls him by name. She gives him his coffee on the house and goes his way. 
As he walks through town, desperate for cash for booze. He tries to rob a liquor store, accidentally shoots and kills the clerk and he panics. He walks out the store goes down an alley and dumps it in a dumpster. He walks away and disappears.

Later, a well dressed man with a bag of garbage goes to throw it away. As he does, his wedding band slips off into the dumpster so he climbs in to retrieve it. He does find it and the gun. He smiles eerily and puts the gun in his pocket. He makes a stop at a flower shop and buys roses for his wife. He continues home and enters. His wife is on the couch. He gives the flowers to his wife and she's like what's the occasion. I remember this clearly: They're for your fucking funeral bitch, and shoots her in the head. From there, he goes to his friend's house with a six pack of beer. They have a few, then the guy brings up his wife and said  how he saw his friend with her as he came home early for lunch. Without even a reply he shoots the friend a couple of times in the chest. His next stop was at a pawn shop in another town where he sells it. 

One day some guy walks in and buys the revolver and a box of ammo. He goes on a killing spree shooting various people who he thinks are criminals. Eventually, police catch up to him, finds out the ballistics match those of two others in the town over and link him to the murders. The police arrest him and puts the gun into police evidence. When it came time for the trial, the detective goes to retrieve the gun from the locker, only now the gun is no longer there and the movie ends. It was on a VHS tape I bought from a yard sale when I was around 17 (50 now) but I been trying to figure out the name of the movie. I tried to Google it, everything but no hits, nothing comes close.

I mentioned that the next few days would be a little nutty with the holidays but that we would definitely get it together before the new year. 
So that Saturday (12/21) I texted him asking if he was available to meet up for an early drink (5pm) the day after Xmas. He said he was working and wouldn’t get home until 7:30. He asked if I wouldn’t mind coming out to his neighborhood. I said in the future I’m happy to go to his neighborhood but for a first meet, I prefer either my neighborhood or a neutral place easy for both to get to. 

He understood and said “we’ll figure it out soon” I said yes, definitely and that was over a week ago. Haven’t heard from him since. 

I’m inclined to believe he’s just not interested in me otherwise he would have reached out days ago to try and set up a date.  Then again it’s the holidays. 

Do I move on or ask him out one more time?

- Being intentional with my spending supports my lifestyle goals of minimalism, simple living, slow living. 
- Saving for retirement
- Learning to live on less will help prepare me for needing less when I eventually retire
- Paying off credit card and medical bills 
- Build up savings (especially emergency savings) 
- I do not want to support making billionaires richer 

My 2024 struggles and takeaways:

- Must be mindful of when I get into a new hobby- I need to keep my eye on the prize and remember that this does not change my financial goals. In 2024 I struggled with this when I got into jigsaw puzzles. No more this year!
- Coffee (coffee shops) and eating out are by far my biggest unnecessary expense. My goal for 2025 is maximum once a month coffee out, and maximum bi-weekly eating out — key word: maximum. Meaning that the goal is even less than that!

Some things to help support my goal:
- Have fun using products/resources I already have, such as all the puzzles I have, crafting supplies, roller skates, lotions/lip balms/self care products 
- Use this time to continue exploring slow living lifestyle, as well as minimalist and simple lifestyle. Continue decluttering, organizing, cleaning. Continue finding enjoyment out of the little things, like sitting outside with a cup of tea.

I typically do a regular coffee (10-12 oz in old machine) in the morning and then an espresso or flat white in the afternoon. What do you all have your regular coffee settings at? I am assuming I’ll need to do a x2 for a large size. Curious on strength, grind, etc. we have the Lavazzo beans everyone has raved about in the machine currently. I typically drank Peet’s major Dickson but they were always oily so I opted for something else, but they are bolder than this Lavazzo I think.

Also, if you typically get a drink with 2-3 shots of espresso at Starbucks, how do you set that amount in a latte or other milk drink?

I started having cramping followed by a rush of blood. I went into emergency, they did bloodwork and ultrasound which showed I was 5w2d, a gestational sac, no fetal pole but a large hematoma. They suggested repeat ultrasound as it was too early. The doctor wouldn’t call it a miscarriage but suggested if my Hcg went down it likely was. That day I had some more heavy bleeding and clots but no tissue (I don’t think?). The bleeding was similar to day 1 or 2 of my normal periods. The next day I had some coffee ground looking discharge with light brown bleeding throughout the day, kind of like the last day of a period. For the last 3 days I’ve hardly had to wear a panty liner, I just have brown spotting with the occasional small clot. 

My Hcg went from 2500 on Dec 24 to 2200 Dec 26. My doctor won’t call it a miscarriage until I have a repeat ultrasound in a week. Is there a chance I could have already miscarried?

","I 35 m started talking to a 38 f back in 2022 from bumble. We talked for a few months getting to know each other through bumble and text  and that progressed to phone call and video call. By the time we meet in March of 2023 for our first date it went really well. We went to a coffee shop and talked and made out for probably an hour after. The reason it took so long to see each other was because she was always busy with sports and being a teacher and her family . She didn't have any kids but she lived at home and always seemed to be busy with her parents. 

Then we went on a few more dates that were great. We dated for about 4 months and probably saw each other about 5 times . She lived like 30 mins from me  . 

One of the dates was a hockey game. She came over we took a nap together and made dinner then went to the game. She took a bunch of pictures and when we got back to my house she said I could look at them on her phone while she went to the bathroom. So I did. Saw all the pictures . 

Then I saw a text chat with a guy she was friends with. It said sorry for being so emotional I was on my period. He said it's OK I needed the reality check. He said I love you. She said I love you too. 

Now some back story to that. She went to visit that same guy on father's day weekend of 2023. She told me about it before going. She said it's a friend I met in college we went one date but after the date I realized he wasn't for me. She said I try to get out to see him on father's day sometimes because his dad committed suicide and I like to be there for him. I said OK well you told me so that means your aren't going to be fooling around.  So the weekend came and went and she said I realized why I don't come out here much he's super annoying. I said that makes me feel good cause a small part of me was thinking something was going on. She said no definitely not he's just a friend I only love you. 

Now back to the I love you text between her and her friend. She is one of those type of people to say I love you and mean it in many different ways. I only say it to family and gf I don't say it friends , she does and did. 

The next week after the hockey game I confronted her about the text. I said I saw the text when looking at pics from the game. She was understandably upset and said you must have to search for them because me and him aren't texting right now. I said I opened up the text app and it was one of the first text exchanges. She said I feel completely violated like you don't trust me even when I told you were I was go8ng and who I was going with. I said i know I just feel like something was off.she said I don't know where to go from here I think we need a break for the weekend to process this. 

So after the break we came back together as friends. We both apologized. Me for looking and her for making me feel like I needed to look. She said look , I understand how me going to see a guy isn't great, I get that now. If you said you were going to see a girl I'd understand but I'd be nervous. 

Fast forward to this current year and we still talk every day almost. Things are different now and it's very hard to not want back what we had.  

Now this last week , I ended all communicating with her. I invited her to my family's place for Xmas who some she met some she hadn't. She said I want to go but I have to take care of my dad who is sick. I said I get that but you always say you want a way out of that to do something fun. She said I know but I really can't be away for that long. 

I said I think we should stop talking. I feel like our conversations have gotten stale and with you being so busy we can't even see each other although we both want too. I said it's very hard to just be friends. I said I'll always love you and remember you place take care of yourself. She said I will always love you too. I'm going to miss you. 

This was a few days ago. Now typing this i miss her. Thanks for reading. I think it helped. ",0,1735527349.0,confessions,4,0.5,False

It was Christmas morning. My wife and I were sipping coffee and watching the news. A couple of hours later, she started having spasms in her intestines. (She has Crohns disease.) This intensifies and eventually she ends up in bed in huge pain. She takes med after med. Nothing is helping. At 4am on the 26th, we end up going to the Emergency room. That ends up being a 14 hour journey. 

Our finances have taken a pretty big hit lately. We both were forced to change jobs recently. We didn't even finish paying December's rent until a few days before Christmas. 

Anyway... We finally made it home around 7pm on Thursday. My wife was just not able to make dinner. I could have, no problem. But it was getting late and I was going to have to get to bed soon. So, we decided to order food. I felt like crap, but I wasn't able to include a tip. Again, money is ultra-tight right now. We didn't really have the money to order out, but cooking wasn't going to happen either. And we can't very well starve. So, no tip it is.

From the driver's perspective, this is just some jackoff no tip order. From our perspective, this is an ""emergency dinner"".

1hpd3vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_recommenders/comments/1hpd3vm/vpns_and_digital_nomads_stay_safe_while_working/,VPNs and Digital Nomads: Stay Safe While Working Abroad,"The rise of remote work has given birth to the digital nomad lifestyle, where individuals can work from anywhere in the world, provided they have an internet connection. Whether you're working from a beach in Bali, a coffee shop in Paris, or a coworking space in Mexico City, the flexibility of remote work is one of the greatest perks of modern technology. However, this freedom comes with a new set of challenges, especially when it comes to online security and privacy. For digital nomads, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are essential tools to stay safe and secure while working abroad. In this post, we’ll explore how VPNs help digital nomads protect their data, maintain privacy, and bypass restrictions while traveling and working in different countries.

1. Why Digital Nomads Need a VPN

Digital nomads are often working from untrusted networks such as public Wi-Fi in cafes, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces. These networks can be insecure, making them vulnerable to hackers, identity theft, and surveillance. Using a VPN while traveling offers digital nomads several key benefits:

1.1. Secure Your Internet Connection on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks are typically not encrypted, which means hackers can easily intercept your data. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and other forms of cybercrime are common on these networks.

How a VPN Helps:

Encryption: A VPN encrypts all of your internet traffic, ensuring that even if hackers are on the same network, they cannot read or intercept your data.

Private Communication: Your emails, documents, and other communications are secured from prying eyes, even on unsecured networks.

1.2. Maintain Online Privacy

When working abroad, you're often connecting to the internet in a foreign country where your internet activity could be subject to monitoring by the government, your ISP, or hackers.

How a VPN Helps:

Hides Your IP Address: A VPN masks your real IP address and routes your internet traffic through a secure server in a different country. This makes it harder for anyone to trace your online activity back to you.

Bypass Tracking and Surveillance: Using a VPN helps protect you from geo-tracking and surveillance, allowing you to browse the web more freely and privately.

1.3. Protect Sensitive Business Data

Digital nomads often deal with sensitive client data, financial information, and intellectual property. Keeping this information secure while working from different locations is critical to avoid data breaches and cyberattacks.

How a VPN Helps:

Secure File Transfers and Communication: VPNs provide end-to-end encryption for your online communications and file transfers, ensuring that your business data remains secure.

Protect Client Information: If you're working with clients remotely, a VPN ensures that their sensitive information is kept private and secure.

1.4. Avoid Geo-Restrictions and Access Content

Many digital nomads rely on streaming services or region-specific websites for work and entertainment. However, access to certain websites or services may be restricted based on your geographic location.

How a VPN Helps:

Bypass Geo-Blocks: A VPN allows you to connect to a server in a different country, effectively bypassing geo-blocks and accessing region-specific content like local news, streaming services, or work-related sites.

Access Business Tools: Some tools and websites may be blocked in certain countries due to local censorship or internet restrictions. A VPN can help you access these sites without interference.

2. How to Choose the Right VPN for Digital Nomads

Not all VPNs are created equal, and when you’re constantly on the move, it’s important to choose a VPN that suits the needs of a digital nomad. Here are some key features to look for:

2.1. Fast Connection Speeds

Digital nomads often need a reliable and fast internet connection to complete tasks like video calls, file transfers, and streaming. A slow VPN connection can be a major hindrance to productivity.

Choose a VPN with high-speed servers optimized for streaming, video conferencing, and heavy internet usage.

Look for a server network that includes locations near your most frequently visited countries to reduce latency and improve speed.

2.2. Server Locations Around the World

A VPN with a large number of server locations allows you to connect to the internet from various regions and access services as if you were in a different country.

Look for VPNs that offer servers in a wide variety of countries, especially in regions where you plan to spend time working (e.g., Europe, Southeast Asia, the U.S.).

Servers in key regions such as North America, Europe, and Asia will give you the flexibility to access local content or services, whether for work or leisure.

2.3. Security and Privacy Features

For digital nomads, security and privacy are crucial. The VPN you choose should offer strong encryption and a clear no-logs policy to ensure that your online activities remain private.

Encryption: Ensure the VPN uses AES-256-bit encryption, which is the gold standard for internet security.

Kill Switch: A kill switch automatically disconnects your internet if your VPN connection drops, preventing any unprotected internet usage.

No-Logs Policy: Choose a VPN that does not keep logs of your internet activity, ensuring that no data is stored or shared with third parties.

2.4. Device Compatibility

As a digital nomad, you likely use multiple devices, including laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Make sure your VPN can be installed and used on all your devices to keep your connection secure no matter which one you're using.

Look for VPNs that offer apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and other platforms, and ensure the VPN can be easily set up on multiple devices at the same time.

Some VPNs also support router installation, so you can secure your entire network at once if you're using multiple devices in a single location.

2.5. User-Friendly Interface

The last thing you want while traveling is to waste time struggling with a complicated VPN setup. Choose a VPN with an easy-to-use interface that allows you to connect with a single click.

Opt for a VPN with an intuitive design and automatic connection features that ensure you stay connected to a secure server at all times.

3. Top VPNs for Digital Nomads

Here are some VPN providers that are highly recommended for digital nomads based on their security features, speed, and ability to bypass geo-restrictions:

ExpressVPN: Known for its fast speeds, strong encryption, and servers in over 90 countries, ExpressVPN is a great choice for travelers and digital nomads.

NordVPN: Offers a large network of servers, excellent security features, and a strict no-logs policy, making it ideal for those who value privacy.

CyberGhost: User-friendly with dedicated servers for streaming and torrenting, perfect for digital nomads who need fast and secure access to content worldwide.

Surfshark: Budget-friendly and offers unlimited device connections, making it perfect for digital nomads with multiple devices.

Private Internet Access (PIA): Provides strong security features, fast speeds, and great value for money.

4. Best Practices for Staying Safe Online as a Digital Nomad

While using a VPN is a great start to securing your internet connection, here are some additional best practices to help you stay safe while working abroad:

4.1. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enable 2FA on all of your accounts, especially your email and financial accounts, to add an extra layer of security in case of a data breach.

4.2. Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Tasks

While a VPN protects you on public Wi-Fi, avoid accessing sensitive information like online banking or entering payment details unless you're on a trusted and secure network.

4.3. Regularly Update Your Software and Apps

Keep your operating system, software, and apps up to date with the latest security patches to protect against vulnerabilities.

4.4. Backup Your Data

Always back up your data to a secure cloud service or external hard drive to avoid losing important files or work while traveling.

5. Conclusion

For digital nomads, VPNs are an essential tool for maintaining online privacy, security, and freedom while working from different locations around the world. With a VPN, you can encrypt your internet traffic, avoid surveillance, bypass geo-restrictions, and ensure that your sensitive data remains protected, no matter where you are.

By choosing the right VPN and following best practices for online security, you can confidently work from any country without compromising your privacy or security.

1hpd3av,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Expert/comments/1hpd3av/how_vpns_are_changing_the_online_privacy_landscape/,How VPNs Are Changing the Online Privacy Landscape,"In today’s digital world, online privacy is increasingly at risk. From data breaches to mass surveillance, the need to protect personal information while browsing the web has never been more urgent. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) have emerged as powerful tools for safeguarding online privacy, offering individuals and businesses a way to encrypt their internet traffic and stay anonymous online. This post will explore how VPNs are transforming the online privacy landscape, their growing importance in an increasingly connected world, and the role they play in protecting user data.

1. What is a VPN and How Does it Improve Privacy?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that encrypts your internet connection, rerouting your data through a secure remote server. This process helps to hide your IP address and encrypt your data, making it unreadable to hackers, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or any third-party observer.

Key Privacy Benefits of VPNs:

Encryption: VPNs use high-level encryption protocols, such as AES-256, to scramble your data and prevent unauthorized parties from reading or intercepting it.

Anonymity: By masking your real IP address, a VPN makes it much harder for websites, advertisers, and even government agencies to track your online activity.

Bypassing Geo-Restrictions: VPNs can help you access websites and content that may be blocked in certain regions, effectively bypassing censorship or geo-restrictions.

2. The Rise of Surveillance and Data Collection

In recent years, concerns about online privacy have been growing as governments, corporations, and cybercriminals are increasingly collecting vast amounts of personal data. Companies track your browsing habits to serve targeted ads, and governments may monitor citizens' online activity for national security reasons.

Challenges to Online Privacy:

Tracking and Profiling: Websites, advertisers, and even social media platforms collect detailed data on your browsing habits, locations, and even personal interests to create profiles for targeted advertising.

Surveillance Programs: Governments and intelligence agencies are increasingly using surveillance programs to monitor internet traffic and track individuals. For example, programs like the NSA's PRISM allow authorities to collect vast amounts of data from internet service providers.

Data Breaches: Companies that collect and store large amounts of personal data are often targeted by cybercriminals, putting users' personal information at risk.

In this environment, VPNs offer a solution to these privacy challenges by masking your identity and ensuring that your internet traffic is encrypted.

3. How VPNs Are Revolutionizing Online Privacy

VPNs are having a transformative effect on how individuals protect their personal information and maintain their privacy while online. Here are some of the key ways VPNs are changing the privacy landscape:

3.1. Giving Users Control Over Their Privacy

One of the most significant ways VPNs are changing the privacy landscape is by empowering users. With a VPN, individuals no longer have to rely on websites or services to protect their data. Instead, they can take control over their own privacy by:

Hiding IP addresses: A VPN hides your real IP address, making it harder for websites and advertisers to track your activity and build a personal profile.

Avoiding geolocation tracking: By connecting to a VPN server in a different location, users can mask their physical location, preventing services from tracking where they are browsing from.

3.2. Defending Against Data Harvesting

VPNs protect users from data harvesting, the practice of collecting large amounts of personal data without the user's knowledge. By encrypting your internet traffic, a VPN makes it difficult for third parties, such as advertisers or even your ISP, to intercept and collect your online activity.

3.3. Protecting Against Public Wi-Fi Risks

Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those found in coffee shops, airports, and hotels, are often unsecured, making them a prime target for hackers. Cybercriminals can easily intercept data transmitted over these networks, putting your personal information at risk.

How VPNs help: When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, a VPN encrypts your internet traffic, securing your personal data from hackers and malicious actors on the same network.

3.4. Supporting Free Speech in Censored Regions

In countries with internet censorship (such as China, Russia, or Iran), governments often block access to certain websites, social media platforms, or news outlets. VPNs allow users to circumvent these restrictions and access the open internet without fear of government surveillance or retaliation.

How VPNs help: By connecting to servers in countries where the internet is free, users can access blocked websites and share information without censorship.

4. The Growing Importance of VPNs in Today’s Digital World

As the digital world continues to grow, the importance of online privacy has become increasingly critical. Individuals, businesses, and organizations are increasingly turning to VPNs to protect sensitive data, ensure privacy, and avoid threats like cybercrime.

4.1. Privacy as a Right

As data breaches, surveillance, and the collection of personal information become more prevalent, privacy advocates are pushing for stronger privacy protections online. VPNs are a crucial tool in the fight for digital rights and the protection of personal privacy. They empower users to protect their personal information and resist invasive data collection by corporations and governments.

4.2. Increasing Use in Remote Work and Business Security

As more people work remotely, VPNs have become a vital tool for ensuring the security of business communications and data. Companies can provide employees with secure access to corporate networks, even when working from home or on the go.

How VPNs help businesses: VPNs help businesses protect sensitive data from cyberattacks, secure communications, and ensure that employees can access company resources safely from remote locations.

4.3. The Role of VPNs in E-Commerce and Online Transactions

Online shoppers and consumers are increasingly concerned about the safety of their personal and financial information when shopping or conducting business online. A VPN secures sensitive data like credit card numbers, bank account information, and login credentials during e-commerce transactions.

How VPNs help: VPNs encrypt data during online transactions, reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft when entering personal information on e-commerce websites.

5. Challenges and Limitations of VPNs

While VPNs offer significant privacy and security benefits, they are not without limitations. Here are some challenges to consider when using a VPN:

5.1. VPN Detection and Blocking

Some websites and services, including streaming platforms and governments, actively detect and block VPN traffic. This can limit users’ ability to access content or services while using a VPN.

5.2. Potential Speed Reduction

Using a VPN can sometimes lead to slower internet speeds, as the data must be routed through a secure server. However, many VPNs offer high-speed servers that minimize this impact.

5.3. Trusting the VPN Provider

Not all VPN providers have the same commitment to user privacy. It’s essential to choose a trustworthy provider with a no-logs policy and a reputation for secure practices. Some VPNs may store user data or even sell it to third parties, which defeats the purpose of using a VPN in the first place.

6. Conclusion

VPNs are revolutionizing the online privacy landscape by empowering users to take control of their privacy and protect their personal information from surveillance, cybercriminals, and data harvesting. As concerns over internet security and personal privacy grow, VPNs provide a crucial solution for protecting online activity, maintaining anonymity, and accessing a free and open internet.

While VPNs offer significant advantages, users should be aware of potential limitations and ensure they choose a reputable provider to ensure maximum protection. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, VPNs will play an increasingly important role in safeguarding privacy and ensuring individuals’ rights to online freedom.

I'm a single, divorced, ""everyday"" kind of guy with a grown kid, so I was never closely connected with the LGBTQ+ community.  I wanted to be, but I was too busy working and being a single dad for a long time.  I don't resent it at all -- great experience. But it didn't allow me to date much. 

I like sporting events, live music, coffee shops, gym/working out, shooting pool, day hiking, sports bars, good food, movies, community service, and great conversations. I'm active in a traditional faith community but that's not an expectation for anyone else. You do you. 

Physically I'm 6' 1"" 180,  blue eyes.  I try to watch what I eat and a light drinker in moderation. I'm not ""hot"" and I'm not unattractive. Squarely mid- I guess 😅

Usually, I tend to have more in common with guys like ages 40 - 50 than with those 50 plus but that's not to rule out anyone.  I'm open.  

I like talking and getting to know people.  Important to me are family, friends, community, and faith. Politically I'm left-leaning.  I like hearing about people's life experiences, cultures, etc.  I'm semi-nerdy on some topics, and I'm learning Spanish. 

I don't do the hookup thing so let's take it slow and see how it goes.  Good first dates are usually some kind of activity like bowling or a car show, or a ball game to watch.

For those of yous about to get out, or recently out (and anyone else out). (Current executive in a large service industry with 5,000 employees. I didn’t finish college and started at the very fucking bottom and worked my way up. So, I know a thing or two and want to help, legitimately). 


Get yourself some good shirt stays. Pictured above. These cost $11.75 on Amazon Prime with two day delivery. They’re nice, go over the toe and under the sock, so no nasty nut schalpping surprise. Most importantly you look squared away. 

Attach those shirt stays to a nice shirt. Wear a nice pair of trousers. Match your belt color to your shoes.   White under shirts, ONLY. I’m telling you, a nice crisp professional look will get you past 95% of applicants these days. You won’t believe the shit I see come into one of my branches for an interview. Anyone in a nice shirt and trousers is going to catch hiring managers’ eyes. 

In fact, go to JC Penny’s, Macy’s or even Men’s Warehouse. Get two to three shirts. (Plain either white or light blue), and two pairs of trousers (one blue l, one black, both tailored). It may cost a little money up front but will pay dividends in the future. Trust me, invest in yourself. 

If you can afford a tailored suit, even better. But, not necessary. I’d rather see you in a well fitted shirt and trousers and a cheap AF and ill-fitting suit. It demonstrates self-awareness and social awareness, too. Ties are great. Don’t get a silk tie for god-sake! You’re not a cheap ass pimp. 

Most of the people your age come in looking like shit, like they don’t care, or dressed in street clothes that look like shit but cost their parents’ entire government check for the month. Stand out. 

Shave. Mother fucking shave. 

If you can’t, clean beard. No one is going to want to hire Ragnar Lothbrok outside of very few employers. 

Almost forgot, don’t wear white socks. Moving on…

Tone it down. I’ve seen so many veterans (especially POGs) ramp up the military jargon and “attitude “. Lots of “check”, “tracking”, “roger”, “Oscar Mike”, “send it”, etc., combined with an annoying ass alpha dog military manner. 

Civilians don’t know what the hell you’re saying and are weirded out by it. Us veterans, just think you’re gay. And not the good gay.

Just come in with your Sunday School professionalism. Be relaxed. Talk like a human being, and throw in some “Yes, Sir’s” “Yes, Ma’am’s”. 

Don’t be cocky. They’ll say they care, but no one cares that you are a Marine, beyond the thought that you’ll work hard and be responsible. 

Brush your fangs! Especially you gotdanged smokers and coffee drinkers. Bring some chewing gum too. 

After your interview, if not offered a job on the spot, follow up. Many hiring managers deal with hundreds of applicants. Drop and email or quick call and thank them for their time. 

Get a professional email. Gmail is great. Pussyslayer2002@yahoo.com will get ignored. Just some version of your name @ gmail is good. Proton is another good service. I guess yahoo is okay if you’re a fucking boomer. Hotmail is a no no. Ghetto AF. 

Once you land your job, be appreciative. It may not be your dream job, but stability, hard work and a little something extra will take you a long way and breed prosperity. Job hopping looks bad on a resume. And you tend to have to start at the bottom all over again. 

Once I stopped job hopping I went from $11.71 per hour to over $100k a year salaried with a 20% performance bonus in less than 10 years. You have to grind. 

Finally, remember, you’re a Marine. That means you hold the reputation of every Marine past, present and future on your shoulders. Act like it.

Supplemental:

Get a mentor in the civilian world. 

Ask vets who are out and successful about their journey. Emulate them. 

If at all possible, LEARN TO WRITE. I took a technical and creative writing course and it served me exceptionally well. 

Learn smartsheet, excel, word, google sheets, etc. 
Have someone review your resume. 

And if anyone here needs any of that help, feel free to DM me. I’m happy to help any young Marine in any way I can. I’ve made a ton of mistakes and have things to teach about what not to do.

1hpcvdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1hpcvdw/my_wife_makes_me_feel_unappreciated/,My wife makes me feel unappreciated,"My wife (33) and I (35) have an 11-month-old little boy. It is not easy at home, we are a bit alone without family support. Lately, I increasingly feel like I am not living up to my wife's expectations. We do not talk much, there is little enthusiasm, few or no sweet words. I receive more criticism about how I do certain things wrong or not well enough than compliments.

Yet, I do my best to make our life easier. I believe I do more than the vast majority of partners. Planning groceries, going grocery shopping, planning meals, cooking (coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and other teas), doing the dishes, putting away the dishes, serving meals, vacuuming, mopping, cleaning the carpet, dusting, scrubbing the shower, cleaning the toilet, washing clothes, folding and putting them away, taking out the trash, taking out the recycling, maintaining the kitchen, making the bed, changing the cats' litter, managing our finances and investments, doing our taxes. She might do one or two things of this list from time to time, but I do them on a daily basis.

We share responsibilities about 50/50 when it comes to our son. For several months, I exclusively took care of him at night so my wife could rest. I sleep in the living room, sometimes only 4 non-consecutive hours. I do not have time to nap. No more sports or exercise. No time for entertainment either. I help with diaper changes, bottles, baths, I play with him, rock him, take him outside in the stroller or baby carrier. I try to be present and involved. I make sure exclusively that my wife's breast pump is always ready to use. Cleaning, sterilizing, drying, and storing the breast pump, other bottles, and baby equipment is primarily me too.

I bring in about 70% of the household income and I do not mind. I am passionate about my work and ambitious. I work from home, so I can see my boy grow up. The days feel very long as I go from night/morning baby duty to work with barely seconds in between, sometimes. The frequent context switches affect my concentration and productivity. I am the only one who can drive, so whenever there is an in-person appointment, I have to take time off. If my wife needs to go out alone or make an important call, I have to take time off work as well to watch after our baby. Some weeks, I can only work a few half-days.

More than ten years ago, our sex life was quite active and varied. Today, I would describe it as rare and bland. Maybe once every month or two. Always the same things. I do not feel desired at all. I still desire her and make sure she knows it.

I can sometimes be unpleasant, after all, I am not always in a good mood. I have to manage the stress of being a new parent at home and the stress and expectations of work. She is on parental leave and is often exhausted due to lack of physical fitness, milk production, and other health issues.

I am not sure what to expect from writing all this on Reddit. At this point, I do not really know what to do to make things better.",1,1735526142.0,Parenting,1,1.0,False
1hpcv0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/StraightTransGirls/comments/1hpcv0e/chasers_who_lovebomb_and_the_curse_of_passing/,"chasers who lovebomb and the ""curse"" of passing","have you ever out with a guy who treats you like a queen, free drinks, introduces you to his friends, hand holding, most romantic night of your life, dancing in the middle of the street, endless giggles? then in bed they want your dick? i've had two of those. my theory is these men are the loneliest most insecure kind of man. they project lots of confidence because they know you're weak and need some kind of sense and hope for love. they shower you in compliments. what gives them confidence? being with many girls at once. they date all kinds of girls, all weights, races because they want to feel wanted. and when they're with a hot passing trans girl they know they won because they can be in public with you acting all in love and then in the bedroom they think they are kings and you're subservient to their deepest fetishes just because you're trans.  the first guy i ever liked would spit in my mouth and choked me until i had a bruise on my neck because i lacked that much confidence. and then he would give me princess treatment. what else? we trans girls are the easiest to ghost. that's the last step.

is stealth better? only if you're confident. being stealth made me realize cis girls go through so much shit. being a stealth pre-op girl i've gotten sexually harassed on dates, sometimes i still have guys treat me like crap because i'm so insecure. i will never forget when i was on this stealth date with a handsome fit guy who earned 80k a year and i thought i was finally being treated seriously and then he grabbed my hand and put it on his dick. i yelled, what are you doing?? and he accused me of making the entire thing up. lol.

when you're a pretty trans girl, the men can't be transphobic to you. it's been so long since anyone called me a slur. but, today alone the guy who was asking me out found out im trans and instead of simply blocking me he made a deeply disgusting sexual remark that he wouldve never said to a cis girl. but even in his transphobia he couldn't deny sexualizing me.

i thought sex and sexuality would be liberaring when i was younger and impressionable. sometimes, it can be fun, i havent paid for a drink on a date in many months, i get guys to pay me ubers, etc etc. but it also opens the door for the type of disrespect that we young impressionable women don't know how to indentify at first. a guy forcing himself on you just because he got you a drink is still predatory. a guy who is begging you to go to his hotel when you said no is still disrespectful, there's nothing attractive about begging a woman for sex. and lastly, the ""respectful"" chaser who wants to look but not touch is still a fetishist.

i don't actually think passing is a curse, it saved my life, i admit it. but it opened up some new ways of being disrespected. i began dating in 2024, and i'm leaving this year disappointed, traumatized and still deeply oversexualized even by guys i went on innocent coffee dates with who think i'm cis. 

being trans is being an image, you go from the ugly duckling to a unique stunning woman. you appreciate attention but unfortunately disrespect seeps in with that attention because the attention is sudden instead of gradual like with cis women.

one of my acquaintances is a non passing trans woman, sometimes i'm deeply jealous of her. she has a giant friend group, she probably likes her own dick lol, she lives her life like she's got nothing to lose. i'm in my barbie stealth girl bag and i can count respectful men only on one hand, my cis girlfriend is jealous of me and i still can't find the confidence in me to not let men walk all over me sometimes. but hey, one day.

1hpcs2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialFiction/comments/1hpcs2d/whiskers/,Whiskers,"It was the last thing Margaret expected to see in the core of Jupiter—a single, wiry feline whisker floating in the viscous, impossible atmosphere of metallic hydrogen. She didn’t dare touch it, though every instinct in her human mind screamed to pluck it from its hovering position and inspect its mystery.

The others were silent. Jacob, their mission lead, stared at the whisker like it might detonate. Dr. Lin bit her lip, muttering equations about gravitational anomalies under her breath. Even Ahmed, usually the loudest voice in their debates over the ethics of drilling into the gas giant's heart, stood frozen.

“Is it... moving?” Margaret ventured, breaking the oppressive stillness.

It was.

Not in the linear, predictable way objects obeying physics should move. No, the whisker pulsed, twitching as though it belonged to something alive. But that was preposterous. Nothing should live here—not with pressure strong enough to crush titanium, temperatures hot enough to liquefy dreams.

“I think it sees us,” Ahmed said at last, his voice hollow.

“Whiskers don’t see,” Jacob snapped, though his tone wavered. He was lying—to himself as much as to them.

Margaret stepped back instinctively, her boot sliding against the metallic platform they had deployed. They were miles deep into the Jovian abyss, their ship tethered to an experimental bore rig—an absurd contraption that pierced clouds of helium and hydrogen like an interstellar corkscrew. What had started as a routine probe to harvest data had spiraled into madness when they’d struck something solid in the supposedly molten center.

The whisker wasn’t alone anymore.

Around it, faint shapes began to emerge in the shimmering fluid—a web of lines, forming and unforming. No, not lines. Tails? Tentacles? Each carried the same texture, faint and feline, as though the universe had doodled a cat onto the fabric of reality and erased most of it, leaving smudges of surreal possibility.

“I vote we abort,” Dr. Lin said, her voice trembling.

“Too late,” Jacob said, his voice cracking. “It knows we’re here.”

“It?” Margaret turned to him, but Jacob wasn’t looking at the whisker anymore. His eyes were locked on something behind her. Something huge. Something breathing.

She turned. And there it was.

The entity defied logic. It was cat-like only in the vaguest of senses—if a cat were stretched through dimensions, warped by gravitational tides and folded into a shape the mind struggled to parse. Its fur shimmered like crushed opals under invisible starlight, its eyes were twin eclipses, and its mouth...

“Did it just smile?” Ahmed whispered.

The thing purred. No, the sound was deeper, resonating through the bones of the ship and into their skulls. Margaret clutched her helmet, trying to shake the vibration loose, but it wasn’t just sound—it was language.

“Stay.”

The word rippled through them, bypassing their ears, their translators, even their brains. It burrowed straight into their spines, planting a singular command.

“Stay where?” Margaret demanded, her voice thin against the Jovian din.

The entity moved—or rather, reality warped around it. One moment, it was meters away; the next, it loomed so close she could see the fractal infinity swirling in its fur. She wanted to scream, to run, but her body refused to obey.

“Margaret,” Jacob said. “You’re... changing.”

She looked down. Her hands had begun to blur, edges smudging as though rendered in soft charcoal. Panic rose, but so did something else—a warmth, a pull, like she was meant to dissolve into whatever this creature was.

“Leave her alone!” Ahmed lunged, but the moment he touched Margaret, his hand fused into hers. They both cried out as the purring escalated, now a torrent of words neither could comprehend. The creature’s smile grew, its mouth unfurling in impossible ways.

“Together.”

“What do you want?” Dr. Lin shrieked, clawing at the controls. “We’re just scientists! We—”

The creature didn’t wait. It surged forward, a tidal wave of limbs and whispers, swallowing them whole.

For a moment, there was nothing.

And then, a room. Simple, Earth-like. A coffee machine gurgled in the corner. Papers lay scattered on a table.

Margaret sat up, blinking. “What the...?”

The others were there, too, intact. No signs of the creature. No sign of Jupiter.

But the whisker? It was on the table, still twitching. And next to it, a note:

“Thank you for visiting. Stay as long as you like.”

Margaret didn’t need to look at the others to know they felt it too: the purring, faint now, but constant. It wasn’t coming from outside. It was inside them.

More tests are needed above ground for excess radiation.” A loudspeaker fills the bunker with its booming robotic voice

“Bullshit” 

October 19th, 2025, 8:00 am

A man and his family were the last ones to enter the safety of the Buffalo, New York bunker. They had planned on leaving much earlier, but when you have two young children nothing goes according to plan. Making the final turn into their suburban neighborhood one word passes through the two parents' minds “Finally”. As they drive into the driveway of their home, the father is careful to make the parking as soft and quiet as possible to not wake his kids. The car stops with a subtle squeak of the breaks, the mother looks back at the kids, still sound asleep.

They both look at each other and smile, getting out of the car each one unbuckles and picks up a child. Both are still sound asleep, all the excitement of the past 20 hours has worn them out. Walking up to their house, it looks like a stereotypical icon of middle-class living. Perfectly preserved and updated 19th-century home just off the border with Canada. Having everything parents of two could ask for. Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a basement. 

Upon unlocking the front door, with his daughter still in his arms asleep. Open the door, the windows covered with blankets just in case they break because of The Storm. Thankfully so far nothing seems broken. Both Parents walk upstairs and put their children to bed. Walking downstairs not saying a word to not wake the sleeping kids. The father gestures over to start taking the blankets off the windows to let light in. 

The final touches of the living room are complete, both parents are satisfied that the room doesn't look like a Tasmanian Devil came in and tore up the place, they decide to go and make breakfast. 

“Still don’t understand why we had to stay in the shelter for so long, I don’t buy the “radiation” nonsense,” the father says as he grabs eggs from the fridge.

“Now John, they are the professionals. What they said goes. I mean, it’s better to be sure than sending people outside and getting radiation sickness or something.” “I mean, do you want Sally to grow another arm? She is Six and already a handful with two,” the mother points out, heating a pan on the gas stove. 

Handing her the eggs and bacon, “You’re probably right Susan, I still have imprints from George holding on to me when the actual Storm hit, he was shaking like a leaf.” John says, giving a little chuckle. 

“I saw that. Sally was surprisingly calm, I think I heard her whispering the “Wheels on the Bus” song to herself, I started to go along with her and it calmed my nerves surprisingly.” “Wanna turn the TV on and see what the news is saying? It’s a little past eight o’clock”

“Sure, didn't they say the news channels were the first to cover the aftermath?” He questions

“I believe so, yes. We might as well see what they have to say” Susan says. John kisses his wife on the cheek and goes to find the kitchen TV remote, which is in the junk drawer. Pointing it to the wall-mounted TV and pressing the power. Changing the channel to “Buffalo Channel 7 News” which was just starting

8:25 am

“Good Morning Buffalo!” The TV bursts out at almost full volume. John frantically turns it down so as to not wake up the kids. A man and woman anchor show up on the screen. “I’m Jim” “And I’m Jennifer and this is Channel 7 for Buffalo”

The camera pans over to the anchorman, he's wearing a black suit and tie combo. He has his iconic million-dollar smile showing his bright white teeth. “If you are seeing this now, that means that you were one of the first lucky few residents of Buffalo to get out of the shelter and beat the traffic, and I have to say ‘Congrats’.”

John, looking up at the TV screen sipping his coffee, was not too impressed with the remark “Jackass”

“Language” Susan gives him a gentle jab, “George and Sally will hear you”

“Sorry” 

The camera pans over to the Anchorwoman, clearly not too impressed with the remark but has to remain professional “Yes, our on-the-ground reporters will take it from here” The picture changes to a scene of a reporter on the side of a major road. “Can you hear us, Audry?”

There is a small delay before the reporter replies “I can hear you loud and clear Jennifer!” She has to speak up with the cars passing by slowly. “We are here on Humboldt Parkway right next to the Main Street bridge that crosses over Scajaquada Expressway!” “As you can see!” The camera pans to the main roads, it’s hectic. “There is bumper-to-bumper traffic going both ways, it is at a standstill! Reports of multiple accidents on the roads! Police are working very much overtime here Jennifer! No reports of any fatalities so far! We have been getting a few reports of loved ones not being able to get in contact with relatives who live just beyond the Canadian-American border, but we believe that it is very likely because of The Storm!” The camera pans up toward the sky, news choppers fly overhead. Like bees. 

“It looks like Richard was given the go-ahead to report live from the sky, and word from his end?” The screen switches back to the newsroom. “We are just about to switch over to him now. Thank you so much Audry” the anchorman says. “You too, we will be here to report on any further development!” The on-site reporter finishes before getting cut off and returns to the newsroom. 

There was a bit of a pause for a few seconds and the anchors talked amongst themselves, making a few dumb jokes that John Misses. He looks over to his wife. “I guess it was a good thing that we were the last ones to the shelter, last ones in and first ones out. We got to miss that shit show.” John says, jabbing a thumb at the TV.

“Yes, but It still took us, what? An hour to get home? At least the kids were asleep by the time we got home.” Susan says, cracking a few eggs. “How do you want your eggs?” “Sunnyside please,” John says, turning back to the TV just in time for the picture to change, sipping on coffee.

The anchorman finished his corny jokes and turned to the camera, “We now go to our eye in the sky. Richard, can you hear us at all?” The screen changed to a birds-eye view of the roads down below, the bottom header saying “Bumper to bumper for miles”

“I can hear you loud and clear Jim, as you can see the traffic just goes on for miles, heading away from the shelter” The camera pans along the roads “There seem to be multiple accidents moved to the sides of the major roads so traffic can keep moving, but it is not doing much.” The camera begins to pan a bit eastward. “As you can see it just stretches. I have never seen this many cars on the road before” 

Inside the helicopter, Richard looks west over towards the American-Canadian border for more to cover. “And towards the border, we should be seeing the same situa-...” he stops mid-sentence. The pause from the reporter is defining. Just the helicopter camera and the city view, panning as it hovers.

“Richard?” The anchorman says confused. 

“Everything alright up there?” “Richard?” The anchorwoman, now sounding concerned for her colleague. The silence lasts a little longer until Richards' voice comes back over. 

“James, turn the camera towards the border. Now!” the reporter yells to someone in the helicopter with him. The camera quickly pans over towards the Canadian-American border. 

“Hey Susan, come take a look at this,” John tells his wife, who just finished up the eggs. “What is it dear?” she asks as she turns off the stove and walks over to him. She starts to take in the TV images. 

The report starts to describe his view “Umm, sorry. I don’t know what I’m seeing up here. Normally where the old Fort Erie is now just forest. Yes, it’s just forest.”

“Richard, that does not make any sense.” The anchorman chimes in, the annoyance in his voice is very noticeable, clearly feeling like he’s being made a fool.

“Fly us over James.” “I don’t care if it’s illegal! Just do it!” The camera starts to move over the border and into Canada. Except, nothing is there. All the buildings, roads, shops, and everything else are now just. Forest. The scene is just an endless forest as far as the camera can show.

John drops his cup of coffee, smashing it onto the ground. Upstairs, hearing the commotion and then the breaking of the coffee cup, John and Susan's two kids are awoken and slowly make their way down the stairs. Sleep still in their eyes, tired and drowsy. Feeling as if they could sleep until Christmas. Finally make their way to the kitchen entrance rubbing their eyes. “Mommy? Daddy? What’s going on? The older one says, still rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Her little brother was right next to her, clutching a teddy bear. 

Susan quickly goes into mother mode “Don’t worry sweethearts. Everything is going to be fine. Come here.” George quickly runs over to her being picked up. Susan gestures for Sally to go to her father, still watching the TV. He picks her up and comforts her. 

More information comes out of the TV. “We have more reports coming in from other stations now, please bear with us folks.” The anchorwoman says just as she's being handed papers. “We are now getting multiple reports of the same scene from other Canadian and American border states. With what looks like just an endless forest.”

John, needing to see with his own eyes, “Sally, I need you to stay here with mommy and your brother, Ok? I need you to be a big girl.” “I will be right back, I need to see if grandma and grandpa are alright”  Sally looking up to her father nods in understanding. 

Looking over at her husband, “Be careful dear.”

“I will Susan” John says, giving her and George a kiss on the cheek. 

During the 2016 Presidential year, John's parents decided to retire north in Canada to escape it all. They moved right next to Peace Bridge to be close enough to visit every other weekend. During the preparations for The Storm, John and his dad set up telescoping shacks. Including a light signal to do Morse code to each other in case communications go out for a while.

John makes his way from the kitchen to the backyard of their home. The wooden telescoping shake was lifted to have a better viewpoint on the Canadian side of the border. Wooden stairs make their way into the main structure. A red wooden door was found in a junkyard and used for the entrance, Sally was the one who picked it out. John opens the door and steps inside.

The room was nothing special, the walls were bare wood with wire sockets on three of the 4 sides. On the wall facing the border, a massive window was installed to use the equipment. A large LED spotting lamp was added with a function to use More Code. A large telescope and an Amature Radio set were also on the desk as well in case of emergencies. It was his father's one that he bought during the Cold War. 

John peers through the telescope to see if the news report is true. They were right. Forest. A wall of thick green forest is the only thing he sees. Not a house, a shop, a school, or even a damned road to be seen. His parents' house should be right in front of his eyes, but it wasn't. Just fucking trees. 

In a last-ditch effort of hope, he tries to signal his father. Who at this time should have been in his shack right now. “-.. .- -.. --..-- / .- .-. . / -.-- --- ..- / - .... . .-. . ..--..” \[Dad, Are you there?\] Nothing. He tries it again, more slowly. Still nothing. They're gone, he thinks. Head in his hands trying his best not to cry, but the tears slowly start to fall from his eyes. One. Then two. Then three. 

“John! You better come see this!” Susan yells for him inside the house. He wipes away his tears, not for him but for his family's sake. He must be strong for them. He runs out of the shack, down the stairs, and into the house. Susan and the kids are no longer in the kitchen/dining room. Hearing the living room TV on that is where he goes. Susan, Sally, and baby George were all sitting in front of the TV. Susan had Sally in her lap, and George was right next to them playing with his teddy bear not having a care in the world. 

He comes over to them and picks up George still playing with his bear. Placing him on his lap while Sally is on her mother's. On the couch, they watch the breaking news on the TV. 

“MSNBC BREAKING NEWS” 8:55 am

“Good Morning America, My name is Andrea Mitchell.” “I am reporting Live from outside the White House, as President Seth Mckinney is about to address the nation.” Underneath the reporter, multiple headlines pass by. “No word of affiliate stations in the following countries: Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Australia” the list goes on. The Audio cuts back to the reporter. “The address to the Nation will be going over every Television network, every radio station.”

9:00 am

She pushes on her ear to listen to something, “We are now changing to the President of the United States”

Mexican-American Border, New Mexico 8:00 am 

The Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico is a barren mostly uninhabitable wasteland with the only life being a handful of creatures, including daring humans. The daring among them, normal people would call them “Crazy” for wanting to live in such a hospitable environment. These few not believing in words of authority, upon hearing about The Storm, and Bunkers decided to take it upon themselves to build their very own away from civilization. 

The desert seems vast and endless, a perfect spot for a handmade bunker. One such bunker sits just a few miles from the border. An old outhouse sits there, worn from the dry sun and freezing nights. An old farmer’s Ford truck accompanies it, hastily parked. 

The silence of the desert is suddenly filled with sounds of hydraulics and gears. A metal panel covered in sand lifts, shaklee. The crude hydraulic system struggling to lift it. Revealing stairs leading into the earth. With thumps of feet, an old man with long white bears and a shotgun comes out, slowly. Pointing the gun in every direction.

“HA!” he says in triumph “I knew the damneded government was liein about that stoopid Storm”

The old man takes off his hat revealing what is left of white hair, whipping sweat. “Martha! Get yer ass up here and take a lookie!” His wife, a skinny old woman comes stomping up after him “Alright, so you were right all along, can we go home now!”

“Don’t worry my love” he gives her a toothy smile “I have one more thing I want to see before that” “Get in Bessy!”

His wife, visibly angry with him “Fine, but I still think we should have gone into the shelters with everyone else” “Those earth shakes still making me shake a few” 

Not hearing his wife's remarks, he goes over to his truck and starts it. Giving it a few honks to make his wife move. “Am coming, am coming” she says walking over to the truck and getting in” They begin to drive off-road, southwest for a long while. Marth, now confused as to why they haven't gone back home. “Where are we going again?”

Her husband “I want to see how the border wall held up”

Now visibly angry with her bonehead husband “Are you kidding me? Good Lord! You couldn’t do this later?”

“I want to see how it held up is all. Is that so hard?” Giving her a toothy smile. Still angry with her husband, and in the end nothing she could do. He was driving. A short while later the old couple make it to the border wall. It was a sight to behold. In surprise, he slammed on the brakes, stepping out onto the hot sand in astonishment. “My god.”

Where was once a tall wall of steel, was now a steaming bent-over mess of metal. Red hot. So hot you could see the heat shimmer off the metal beams, distorting the view on the other side. Cautiously, the old man walks over for a closer look. 

“Be careful, please Ernest!” His wife yells at him from the truck. Still looking at the heap of metal, he waves a hand in understanding. Getting closer to the coolest and widest part, he hops over to the other side of the Wall. It's still desert, except for a hot purple glowing ditch in the earth. He estimated it to be 2 feet wide, but he was unable to tell how far it went down because of the smoke. It seemed to go on for miles, East to West, slowly curving. 

Ernest jumps back over the wall, almost losing his footing, and rushes his wife to get back in the truck. He starts the truck, kicking sand and first in the air as he speeds off to the nearest town. 

“What is it? Ernest? What did you see?” Martha questioned him. 

Ernest, Still paying attention to the road, describes the purple ditch in the sand, stretching for what seemed like miles and miles. “Good god,” she says to him. Facing back front, without a second thought she turned on and adjusted the radio to the nearest news station. 

“Ladies and gentlemen who are now toning in, we are about to go live at the White House in Washington, D.C. Where the President is about to address the nation over the recent news coming in. To recap, All over border states, the same thing is being said, to the Canadian-American border it seems that the country of Canada is gone. And reports are coming in from the southern border states on the Mexican-American border with the same kind of news, The Country of Mexico is gone” There was some whispering coming through the speakers, “We are now going to broadcast the President's address to the Nation”

Washington, D.C. 8:20 am, 40 minutes to National Address

The military has been called to keep D.C. under control and in order. The Capital was in complete chaos as more and more reports came in from news stations around the country. Senators running to and from offices and chambers trying to get a handle on things. Over the last few years, the political landscape of the United States has changed drastically. 

Both the House and Senate are Democratic Majority, ever since the fracturing and splitting of the Republican Party in Early 2022 has allowed the Democratic Party to have major wins in the Midterm Elections. And path the road to the landslide win in the 2024 US Election.

From the fracturing and splitting of the Republican Party, the Bull-Moose Party was formed with the framework of the Original party that Theodore Roosevelt formed in 1912 and incorporated a more Progressive-Conservative approach. The notable reasoning for this split is that former President Donald Trump was imprisoned for his involvement in the riots of January 6th, being charged with treason and disqualified from running. Was given 25+ years in federal prison with no parole. This was many republican congresspersons' final straw, and they decided to leave the party and for the Bull-Moose Party. 

After these shocking events, the Republican Party is now a shell of its former self. Having its reputation tarnished, it is now fully controlled by a handful of Far-right extreme senators. Who only have a small amount of power and a handful of states in their political control. 

Each party leader is in conversation with their respective house and senate leaders. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both convening in Schumer's office, finish going over how to keep Congress from going into a deadlock. The desk phone rings. 

Looking at the number on the phone, the Senate leader instantly recognizes the number and answers the phone. “Hello? Chuck Schumer speaking” The person on the other side has a feminine voice. “This is the White House, Please Hold for the President”. This was a subtle click then a wait, looking up at the House leader he puts the phone on speaker for him to join the conversation.

This is another click and a male voice comes through the phone speaker, “Chuck? It’s Seth. I wanted to call you personally. How’s it over there?”

“Well, Mister President. It’s chaos here at the moment, everyone is still trying to figure out what the hell happened. Jefferies is here with me now, you are on speaker sir.”

“Oh fantastic, I was planning on calling you next Hakeem. I’ll cut to the chase, I need both of you here at the White House in 30 minutes, I already have the Vice-President rounding up both the House and Senate Minority leaders of the GOP and Bull-Moose as we speak, we need to have a meeting to deal with the crisis”

The congressman, happy that the ball was moving in some direction “We were just discussing the same thing, sir, we-” Before he could finish speaking there was a knock on the office door. He tells the person on the other side to come. It's the Vice-President. Schumer standing to greet her “Madam Vice-President” Jeffries does the same.

Vice-President Lilly “I presume you know why I’m here?”

The president chimes in from the desk phone speaker “I was just telling them now Lilly, I presume you have the other four leaders?”

Both House and Senate Leaders looked behind the Vice-President, the four party leaders were standing in a little group. To the left was Mitt Romney, Senate Minority leader, and Liz Cheney, House Minority leader of the Bull-Moose Party. And to the right was Ted Cruz, Senate Minority leader, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, House Minority leader of the GOP. “Yes sir, they are outside waiting now.”

“Fantastic! I will see you all here soon!” 

*Click* 

The White House 8:25 am, 35 minutes to National Address

The subtle click of the plastic phone was the only sound in the Oval Office, just Seth, the desk, and other furniture. Taking a deep breath and rubbing his eyes, Seth pushes back from the Resolute Desk to stand and stretch. He’s still getting used to his new leather chair, a reproduction of the one JFK used. He just got it a few weeks before The Storm. 

He slides his fingers over the desk, walking over to the window only to see the Secret Service patrolling the perimeter. Some military vehicles are parked for extra security. At least it is a sunny morning. *Knock Knock*

Looking over to the door “Come in”

The door opens, and his aide, John Malkovoy comes in. “Sir, the camera crew is ready to set everything up.”

“Alright send them in. Also, is the speech done?”

“Yes sir, I have it with me,” John says walking in holding papers that could only be said speech. John ushers the camera crew in to start setting up for the broadcast. Moving the big furniture to make room for the equipment, they have to push it to the side, stacking the smaller pieces as there is no time to take it out of the office. 

Walking over to his aid, “So? How does it look?” questioning him.

“It looks great sir, encouraging, hopeful, informative, and straight to the point.”

“Good Good. And everyone else? How are they holding up?”

“Everyone's doing alright, Jen cried in her office for a few, but she picked herself back up and got to work.” Remembering something “Also The House and Senate Majority and Minority leaders are on their way with the Vice-President, I just got the word right before they left.”

“That's good to hear John.” Seth put his hand in front of him “The speech?”

John, taking a second for his brain to catch up “Oh Yes Sir, forgive me.” he hands him the speech.

“It’s fine,” Seth says thinking. He’s a good kid, a little slow, but still good. Seth thinks as he looks over the speech. “Give me some time to memorize it. Also have the members of Congress meet in the Cabinet Room, as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the rest of the cabinet, set up a TV in there so they can watch the speech as well. Once I am done I will join them there. I'll leave everything else to you. I will be in the President's Room, come get me 15 minutes beforehand.”

“Yes Sir”

“John, Thank You,” He says to John, the aide nods his head and turns around to perform his duties. Seth walks by the camera crew setting things up, speech in hand. He opens a door to the president's room. Originally used as a separate dining room, when coming into the office, Seth wanted a place to sit and relax for a few minutes. To ease his nerves. The room was housed in a few soft comfortable chairs, a big dark chenille green sofa up against the wall, and a large oak coffee table in the middle of 2 couches. Side tables on each side of said couches and sofa. 

Seth walks over and sits in one of the big brown soft reading chairs in the corner, which has a lamp on it and a phone in case he needs anything. Sitting down and turning on the light, he starts to read the speech, muttering the words to himself. Hours before he mentioned he wanted to write some fast-action executive order to get ahead of the chaos that will most likely plague the Nation for some time. Many will not like what he has to do. Few of the orders will be mentioned in the speech. 

Time passes, and Seth has read the speech front to back multiple times. Before he started to read it again there was a knock on the door. 

Looking up from the speech to the door “Come”

The door opens and John walks in “We are 15 minutes from going live Sir”

“Good, could you get Victoria to come here, please? I need to ask her something about this speech. I want her opinion on something”

“Yes Sir, Right away” John turns around to go and get the Speechwriter. A few minutes go by when there's another knock on the door. “Come in”

The door opens and Victoria walks in, she's wearing black dress pants, a white button-up, and a navy blue blazer with black flats. She seems a little confused. “You wanted to see me, Sir?”

“Yes please, have a seat. Just wanted to talk about the speech for a minute before we go on the air”. He gestures to one of the chairs. She takes the offer. “It’s good, I just wanted to ask about the ending bit here” He points showing her, reading it off, “Thank you, and let us move forward together with courage and resolve” 

Looking from the point of the speech and back to him, “What’s wrong with it?”

Seth needs to explain a bit more. “I think it doesn't get the message through as to how serious the situation is. I believe to get the severity across it would be a good idea to have it end in a way I don’t normally end my speeches. Do you understand?”

“I think so Sir, I mean I thought about putting “God bless you and may god bless the United States of America,” But then I remembered throughout the campaign you stated that you were not a religious man. That's why I didn't add it in.”

“Yes I remember, but I think it would be a good idea to add something along the lines of that in, to show the seriousness of the situation we are in. To get it across” He gestured with his hands with a bounding crossing motion, like crossing a line. 

Victoria takes a moment to ponder what he means, “I see what you mean. Want me to write it in?” He hands her the paper, she takes a pen crosses the old final sentence out, and replaces it with a new sentence. “There. How does that look?” She hands the speech back to him, he rereads the final bit with the added change. 

“Looks good Victoria” looking up from the speech.

“Is there anything else Sir?” She asks as she gets up from the chair. 

Looking up at her “No, thank you.” She gives a little nod and makes her way out the door. Looking down at his watch, 5 minutes to the address. Quickly looking over the speech once more with the changes, he makes his way back to the Oval Office. 

Upon opening the door, the once-active room fell silent when he walked in. “Hope I’m not interrupting anything?” There was a little chuckle from a few of the people. Seth makes his way to the Resolute Desk and makes himself comfortable. Speech now in front of him. John walks over to him “Sir, the Congress members are in the Cabinet Room.”

“Thank You, John. I presume the TV is in there as well?” looking over to the aid. 

“Yes Sir”

“Good”

The aid walks away as the camera crew is done setting up.

The man behind the camera, “Alright everyone we are on the air in.” He gestures with his fingers. He gestures with his fingers “5, 4, 3, 2” And mouths One, and a light goes on the Camera.

Millions of Americans sit in front of the TV, their phones, Radios, or any other device that can play the speech from the President. Waiting in anticipation for what he has to say. 

“My fellow Americans, Today October 19th, 2025 was supposed to be a celebration. Not just an American celebration, but a worldwide celebration. Of our species surviving an extinction-level event. One that would have changed the fabric of our society and the course of our future. Sadly as many of you know, that does not seem to be the case. 

As to what I am speaking of for those who still do not understand. On our borders with our northern and southern neighbors, something extraordinary has happened. On our northern border, which once was homed to Canada, the cities, towns, roads, and parks. There are now mountains, forests, grasslands, arctic tundras, and many more. Our southern border is showing the same thing. Mexico, where the same kind of cities and towns, now sit deserts, rainforests, mountains, and barren coastlines untouched by humanity. 

Moreover, with extensive time and research from our satellites overhead, this government believes one thing, we are no longer on Earth. Looking extensively at photos taken by said satellites has shown that the areas of Central America, and the Caribbean have also been affected. The island state of Hawaii and the Territory of Puerto Rico are still with us.

Hawaii has been moved to less than 50 miles off the coast of California. And as we speak we are in contact with the Governor of Puerto Rico and Hawaii to get them anything they need. Our overseas territories have now been moved to various areas along both the Pacific coast and the Atlantic coast, and we are now trying our very best to get in contact with them via satellite. To the reason why we and these landmasses have been brought to this strange world. We do not know, and we may not know for a time.

I promised you when I took the office of the presidency to be as full, transparent, and truthful; Let me be absolutely clear: as of right now, we are cut off from home. But that does not mean we are alone here, later this evening we will be releasing orbital photographs and basic maps on the official government website. To the east of us sits 2 continents, for now, we will be designating them the following: Alpha will be the closest continent and Bravo will be the farthest away from North America. These names will stay until we know the official names of the 2 continents from those who call them home.

In response to this unprecedented situation, the Vice-President, the Secretary of Defence, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I have decided to raise our national defense posture from DEFCON 3 to DEFCON 2. Effective immediately, all military leave is canceled, and all service members of the United States Armed Forces are ordered to report to their nearest base for further instructions.

To address this crisis, I will be signing several executive orders, including the following:

1. All landmasses that were once the nations of Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean are now under U.S. protection. These areas shall be designated as U.S. territories until further notice.
2. Expeditions into these territories will begin promptly to locate critical resources.
3. The Stafford Act will be put in place, and FEMA and the Red Cross will be put into full effect.
4. All non-essential government services will be temporarily suspended.

Later today I will be discussing with the Heads of both the House and Senate Parties how to apply for these orders precisely. 

I strongly advise businesses to adopt a work-from-home policy, this will work under the Defense Production Act until we can acquire the resources lost from imports. Furthermore, the federal and state governments will convene with the Department of Labor, and the Department of Transportation on how to maneuver this great obstacle ahead of us. 

If you are a business that cannot do a work-from-home policy, we ask you to please get in contact with the DOT, or do vehicle sharing between employees. 

In preparation for The Storm doing far greater damage, each major city bunker has a minimum of 6 months' worth of supplies. State governments are here advised to ration those supplies out for a time until they can be replaced. With this in mind, all non-essential manufacturing is hereby suspended under the Defense Production Act. As well as the Stafford and National Emergencies Act to coordinate in repurposing industries to manufacture essential goods for the time being. More information will be released on the official government website.

My fellow citizens, I know many of you are feeling a mix of confusion, fear, and perhaps even loss in light of these events. We are in uncharted territory, but we are not without strength, and we are not without each other. We have faced extraordinary challenges before, and together we have always found a way forward.

To every American, I ask you to remain steadfast. Trust in your leaders, look out for one another, and remember that, as always, we are stronger together. This is a time of great uncertainty, but I have faith in our unity, resilience, and shared strength. Together, we will face this new world with courage and resolve.

Thank you, and may God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.""

I’ve been buying ahead on foods I can store longer-term (ex, dry beans, coffee that can be stored in the freezer, etc.) This isn’t prepper level, but I’m trying to buy while it’s presumably cheaper and lets me opt out of even a few purchases during the next administration.

Also purchased: Shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, bar soap, laundry detergent, cleaning supplies, razor blades, coffee filters, motor oil, bulk bottles of dish soap, etc.

I’m also planning on getting fresh rechargeable batteries as mine no longer hold a charge.

I try to be low-consumption in general, so it’s been an interesting process for me.

The library is a fantastic resource I use a lot for audio books, movies, craft lessons, etc, in addition to physical books. I try to buy thoughtfully and plastic-free whenever possible, but I’m planning on continuing to improve in 2025.

Is anyone else pre-buying to better prepare for an extended, concentrated protest low-buy in the next administration?",5,1735524996.0,nobuy,3,1.0,False

I moved down here with my girlfriend a little over a year ago. Things got rocky between us rather quick following the move, and we didn't get out to socialize much. We decided to split up this summer and she moved back to our home state, but I wasn't able to due to the lease/work commitments. I also really love this area and would prefer to stay!

Any advice for meeting late 20/early 30 year olds?

I've gone to a few bars and coffee shops the past couple months and I've met a handful of awesome people, some of which I've exchanged numbers with and we've met up again, but the age gap remains an issue for me. 

I'd like to avoid the college bar scene if possible. Drinking is not a problem, but I don't like having to yell over music when trying to meet people

My next plan is to attend some events at game shops, does anyone know if there are others around my age at those events?

Should I turn to the ""find friends"" version of dating apps? I've been hesitant to this point as I believe most people act differently behind a keyboard

Any advice is welcome, fun stories and memories are too!",8,1735524971.0,Knoxville,10,0.84,False
1hpchv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1hpchv1/tonsillectomy_experience_as_a_21_year_old_male/,Tonsillectomy Experience as a 21 year old male,"After years of recurrent and chronic tonsillitis—and a particularly bad year of longer term complications from repeat infection—I finally got my tonsils removed on 12/16. This group has been super helpful as I prepared for and navigated my own recovery, so I only feel it’s right to share my experience. 

**Disclaimer: I am not a medical professional and nothing I say should be taken as medical advice. Everyone’s experience is unique and you should consult your doctor for the most informed information.**

Surgery 12/16: my operation took place late-AM. It was very smooth, and was not very stressful for me. My surgeon had great bedside manner and made the process as stress free as possible. I experienced very minimal discomfort after waking up, drank a few glasses of water, had a popsicle and went on my way.

 Day 0/1: Not too painful. Tylenol and Advil was sufficient. I had a few liquidy protein smoothies, drank lots of water, Gatorade, and had some lukewarm bone broth. Sleeping the first night was difficult, and fair warning, it didn’t get easier until day 9/10. 

Day 2-4: Pain increased, so I began to take oxycodone and Tylenol as prescribed to me. At this point, I also had a lot of swelling making it hard to swallow even water. I called my doctor and was prescribed prednisone, which alleviated A LOT of the swelling and pain within a few hours of the first dose. This was a game changer for me. I continued to consume soft foods like protein smoothies, bone broth, coconut water, Gatorade etc. I also started eating mashed potatoes. This was a staple for me all recovery. I cut my mashed potatoes with bone broth to make it a soupier consistency and easier to eat. Around day 2, I also stopped talking much because it was too painful. I decided to rest my voice and avoid unnecessary discomfort. 

Between days 1-2, I did have 3 minor bleeds. But all stopped at home within an 30mins-an hour by holding ice water in the back of my throat, as instructed by my surgeon. I did not bleed again after day 2. 

Day 4-8: the pain really increased during these days. I’m not exactly sure what day was the worst or when it peaked. All of these days are kind of a blur to me. I also became intolerant to cold foods. So I quit consuming anything colder than room temperature. Mashed potatoes were still on the table, and I started eating eggs. A lot of soft scrambled eggs. 

Day 9 & 10: this is when I started to turn a corner. The pain decreased notably and I was able to talk a little bit again and started to regain an appetite. I discontinued the oxycodone at this point. My diet remained similar to the days prior. I found the soft foods not to be too painful, and I didn’t feel like putting myself through extra discomfort to try out new things. 

Day 11-13: strong improvements everyday. I could talk almost without pain again. My voice still sounded muted, but I expect this to improve with time. I started mixing in ground beef, soft cooked fish, shredded chicken and pasta to my diet. My body thanked me for this! I also was able to finally start sleeping at night. The nights prior were very hard for me to sleep, and I was starting to feel unwell from the lack of sleep. Days 12 & 13 I left the house for a few hours to run light errands with my mom, grab coffee, etc. It was nice to get out of the house! 

Today (day 13) I feel about 75% back to normal. I’m still eating relatively soft foods to be on the cautious side, but I’m content with the variety of things that I can now eat. I do look forward to eating a steak soon though 😋

WHAT HELPED ME:
- HYDRATION. It’s important to stay hydrated for healing, but also to keep your scabs moist. I drank a lot of water, and tried to get electrolytes in through coconut water and Gatorade. Coconut water was great for me to drink all throughout recovery, and was an easy way to drink some calories. Gatorade was good for me the first few days, but by day 3 or so, the salt stung too much. So I stopped drinking this until later in recovery ~day 10. 
- HUMIDIFIER. I invested in a high-quality humidifier to keep my throat moist as I slept. I think this helped a fair bit. 
- ICE. I can’t say enough good things about ice. It relieved a lot of pain throughout the recovery. I used an ice head wrap (like the one for wisdom teeth) and an additional ice pack to rest on my lower neck/throat. I iced 10+ times a day for the first 10-11 days. 
- PREDNISONE. This helped relieve SO much pain. I think a lot of my initial pain came from swelling. I took prednisone days 2-10ish. I was initially prescribed 5 days worth, but requested a few days more after I realized how much it helped. I will note, the prednisone did make it harder for me to sleep and stay asleep. 
- HEALTHY FOODS. I’m a healthy eater in general, and am a big believer that the foods you consume affect how well you heal. I prioritized consuming high quality foods like bone broth, clean-ingredient protein powders, organic coconut water, etc. I’m sure this played a part in my recovery. 
- LAXATIVES. I knew from reading y’all’s posts that I would be constipated after surgery. I began proactively taking Miralax 1-2x daily and Ducolax 1x daily and a probiotic to prevent extreme constipation. Yes, I got constipated, but not too bad because I started laxatives before it was too late. 
- WALKS. I took 2-3 short (10-15 min), very low-intensity walks starting on day 2 or so. This helped relieve my restless legs, gave me sunlight, and kept me from going stir crazy indoors. 
 
RANDOM NOTES: 
- Morning time was the most painful for me. Waking up and drinking water was very uncomfortable, but once my throat got reacclimated to drinking, I felt better for the rest of the day. 
- Sleeping wasn’t too fun. I had a hard time sleeping, partially induced by the prednisone I was taking, and by sleeping with my head elevated. 
- I developed a cough after surgery. I think this is pretty common, and my surgeon said not to worry. I still have it, but it’s improving. I was afraid it might affect my scabs but it didn’t seem to. 
- Salt stings bad! After day 2, I had to stop drinking Gatorade and consuming pedialyte pops because the salt in them stung too much to tolerate. 
- Iced Coffee. I’m a big coffee lover. The first two or three days, I didn’t drink any coffee just because I was so out of it. But I started drinking a glass of iced coffee in the mornings around day 3 or 4. This made me happy, gave me a little boost of energy and made me feel a little more normal. I knew hot coffee is off the table, so I opted for iced.
- Water alarms. I did wake up at night every few hours to drink water. More frequently earlier on, and less frequently later in the recovery. I do think this helped prevent some pain in the mornings when I woke up and drank my first sips of water for the day. 
- I used so many tissues and paper towels to spit out mucus during the first week or so of recovery. Like so many. Stock up. 

Look, there’s nothing fun about this surgery. It’s painful as hell, but I got through it, and I know I’ll be glad I had my tonsils removed when I no longer deal with 24/7 tonsillitis and recurrent infections. It’s uncomfortable, but not as scary as some of these posts make it seem. If you are about to go through this, or are just starting your recovery, I wish you the best. I’m thankful for all of the posts here that helped me prepare for my experience, and I’m hoping you might find something helpful from this post.
