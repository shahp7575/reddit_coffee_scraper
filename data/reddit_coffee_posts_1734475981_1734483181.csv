So we do not have a coffee maker or any coffee beans. He has a friend who lives hours away and he sees him in person once every year or two. Usually when he comes up, he brings his girlfriend. 

They stayed over for a few days last year. Before they came, I asked if they wanted any food or drinks to have in the house and I told them what we normally kept stocked in the house. They didn’t make any requests. 

The first morning the girlfriend wanted coffee. I told her we did not have any way to make coffee here, but I could bring her to the coffee shop which was 2 minutes away. She declined but her mood seemed sour after that. We hung out with other mutual friends for the day and I learned from one of them that she was really upset we didn’t have a way to make coffee at home because she needs it in the morning. Each morning I offered to bring her to the coffee shop and she always declined. I even offered it as my treat in case they didn’t have the money. She declined still. 

Well they came over again a year later. I still didn’t have a coffee maker because we don’t drink coffee. This time, she called me a bad host to my face because I had them over knowing she needs her coffee and I didn’t get anything to make coffee. 

I am a people pleaser. And I go huge lengths to make guests most comfortable. But I can’t justify having a coffee maker we don’t use for maybe a once per year guest. I don’t have the storage space for it. 

I talked to people about it and some think I was right, we don’t drink coffee, we don’t have it. But a lot of others think that if you ever have guests, you should have coffee available. And this makes me think of my mom and grandma who always had coffee ready within minutes of guests arriving, expected or not. So this skews my view.

At the time I (20 at the time NB) was a freshman in college and made a few friends with the girls on my dorm floor (I was in a girls dorm cuz I was assigned female at birth). One girl on my floor, Gwen, (19F) was kinda uncomfortable with how confident I am. I’ve always been pretty grown up for my age cuz I grew up with a lot of family trauma and medical trauma. Because of that I don’t really feel the need to be insecure. If you hate me you hate me and if you like me then awesome let’s be friends. To give an example of how uncomfortable this girl was, I had a girlfriend in high school that was very on and off and when telling Gwen about it she asked “Are you a sex addict?” I’m not. Very laughable question.
Now to the story, I met a guy, Nick, (20m) that was really close with a lot of girls on my floor. We went on one date at a coffee shop on our campus. The next day we had breakfast together and went back to my dorm and made out for a while. We had fun and I was left with a couple hickeys. He left and a couple hours later I went to the community center at school to meet up with Nick, Gwen, and a few other friends to play a game. I sat next to him and acted how (at least how i thought) anyone that just made out with a guy would act around him after. I occasionally touched him arm, laughed at his jokes, stuff like that. THATS AT! I didn’t kiss him or touch him inappropriately at all. Now I don’t remember what the game we were playing was called but it was basically a Who’s Most Likely To game where all the questions were pretty sexual or just crazy and people voted for who is most likely to do it. 
The card that got me into this situation was Who’s Most Likely To Have a Bush? Weird I know. I was voted as the most likely. Which I didn’t mind. It’s true. This started a conversation about how it’s apparently unhygienic to have a bush. For some context, Nick hasn’t eaten pussy before and he’s very open about that. So in response to all the people saying that my bush is basically gross I said “So basically, Nick, the first time you eat pussy shouldn’t be me.” Most of the people in the group laughed. And when I say laugh I mean LAUGHED. I laughed along with everyone but when i looked around I saw that Gwen left the room and Nick walked away. I wasn’t shocked that Gwen left. She had left after other jokes a made in the past (mostly self deprecating and understandable for the conversation) but why would Nick walk away? He came back after a moment and started SCREAMING at me. “YOU DUMB BITCH! YOU DISGUST ME! YOU CANT FUCKIN TALK LIKE THAT! YOU DISGUST ME! YOU MAKE ME SICK!” He went on like that for a few minutes so I got up and walked away for a second and cried a little. My other friend in the group, Sam (19F and fake name for her cuz she’s not a problem in this story) came with me and calmed me down and tried to convince me to sit down with everyone and stay but I just couldn’t do it. I tried to sit for a few minutes but i started getting a stress headache and just left and went to my dorm. 
Later that night me and Nick texted and he just doubled down. Saying that I kept “groping him.” GROPING?! TOUCHING HIS ARM IS GROPING?! Listen I could be wrong and if I’m voted the asshole I’ll learn my lesson but since when is touching someone’s arm groping? 
So yeah that’s what happened. I don’t know these people anymore and don’t go to that school anymore either for the way it blew up afterwards. 
I’ll give anyone details if they ask for more information.

1hgphtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1hgphtg/pathetic_how_to_make_friends_post/,Pathetic how to make friends post,"Honestly just looking for support, and a safe-ish (no place on the internet is fully safe lol) place to share.  I'm a late bloomer, I guess.  Mid 40's.  Had one relationship with a woman in my early adulthood that absolutely wrecked me, and a few brief romances around the same time period.  Then lived straight for years.  I honestly am not sure I'm really pan, because I don't usually find men attractive unless I first develop a connection to them- and any man that I've been ""connected to,"" has been through some sort of trauma bond.  I call myself pan because I honestly don't know of a better way to explain that I'm sexually attracted to the feminine, and how that presents or what gender someone was at birth doesn't really matter to me.    
Basically, I think I've spent the last 20ish years trying to punish myself and staying way too long in shitty relationships with men to prove to myself that it's all ok, I can live straight etc, etc.  Common story, I know.   
At this point, I'm ""out"" to most people.  I'm lucky in that I've recently moved somewhere with a pretty strongly established queer scene, and there are more places in the city where acceptance is the norm than not.  So discrimination isn't something I have to deal with at the level that other people in the country have to.  
However, I'm running into some difficulty because, at this point in my life, I'm not looking to date.  I just really, really need friends.  Especially queer friends.  And I am lonely and feel alone as f---- because I'm in a new city.    
The supportive family members I have are telling me I need to get back out there and hook up, essentially.  Even had one tell me plainly that my ""marketable"" days are numbered lol.  I don't care.  I've spent over 30 years struggling with not accepting and knowing who I am, I would rather die alone and feeling like I know who I am than go partner up or explore random hook ups while I'm still not healed. I don't need to explore my sexuality, I know I love women.  Don't get me wrong, I'm lonely and would love a cuddle, and I have a high libido (I'm a woman in my 40's, duh), but I'm also currently unemployed, living in a new city, and trying to get my emotional and physical shit together- no one wants or deserves to deal with this with me lol.  
However, I want friends.  Connection.  Etc.  But I feel like it's really hard to convey that when meeting people, and it's hard to build friendship while trying to be clear that I really am only interested in friendship.  I feel like I may have accidentally given the impression a few times that I was being flirty, when I genuinely wasn't looking to pursue anything romantic.  This is made more difficult, of course, if there's actually a spark.  Even if there is, I don't want to pursue the spark, just the friendship.  How the F do I navigate this?  
To be clear, I'm not saying I need a way to ward people off or something, I don't think I'm a catch, etc.  I just want to be able to say, essentially, ""Hey, you seem really cool, can we get coffee,"" without it sounding like I'm interested in them romantically.  There have been a few times when I've seemed to be connecting with someone on a friend level, but then when I ask to do something together I get an immediate mention of their partner, etc, along with a decline and/or distancing.   
Maybe I just genuinely don't know how to make friends lol.

They were among a group of nine men on a hunting trip in the Cushe forest when they consumed coffee that was prepared with the supplies suspected to have been poisoned.

Dead is Vishnu Dipchan, also known as “Lord”, 65, of Legendre Road in Ecclesville, Rio Claro.

Basdeo Rambharose, 58, Jaggernath Ramnath, 68, both also of Legendre Road in Ecclesville, Arjoon Persad, 40, of Mahabalsingh Trace in Navet Village, Rio Claro, and Rajkumar Baksh, 42, of Governor Trace, Chin Chin Road, Cunupia, were treated and transferred to the Sangre Grande Hospital for further observation.

Rafi Baksh, 39, Shaban Khan, 57, Navish Rambharose, 32, and Salim Khan, 27, also of Legendre Road, Ecclesville, received medical treatment and were discharged from hospital.

Leader of the Hunters Search and Rescue Team (HSRT) Vallence Rambharat said yesterday that the tragedy has left the hunting community in shock.

“Vishnu Dipchan was a very seasoned hunter and, as far as we know, the circumstances under which he passed away is something that is occurring for the first time in the hunting fraternity. This morning, I spoke to three senior hunters—guys in their 80s—and as far as their memory serves them something like this has never occurred in their living memory. This cannot be tolerated in the hunting community. It could have been that we lost nine men last night,” said Rambharat.

The HSRT leader said that villagers speculated that the hunters were aware of mercenary poachers setting trap guns.

“I hope the authorities act quickly and gather as much information as they can. They have to act and stop what occurred dead in its tracks. It is not something that can happen again,” he said.

A police report stated that the group of nine hunters had trekked approximately four miles into the Cushe forest, off Legendre Road, to a hunting camp.

Around 7.30 p.m. Dipchan, Rambharose, Ramnath, Persad, and Baksh consumed coffee which was prepared from supplies in the camp.

1hgpe6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hgpe6r/m29_feels_so_awful/,"M29, feels so awful.","I have been in a relationship for 5 years. It has been full of fights. The second date we ever had I took her to “the wrong place” and she called me a f#ggot. After fighting the first couple of weeks alone, she pinned me against the wall begging me not to leave. I ignored all of this stuff at the beginning, trying to find reasons why she would think any of it was okay, including slapping me multiple times early on. She stopped hitting me for years, but would get so emotional she would block me in rooms and not leave, and would follow me around the neighborhood crying angrily if I walked out. 

She had told me I could go to college full time and not work, which ended up being a massive mistake. There were so many days I wouldn’t sleep because we would fight all night, and I would have to go to school, and I eventually got a job after a year, so I would go to school then work on very little sleep.

She would put me down “jokingly” all the time. Every time something good would happen she would find a way to devalue it. Once she shut the lights off to the apartment when I was doing my homework because I wouldn’t fight her, and she told me she hated me and she hoped I failed school.

Eventually, young women at school showed interest in me and I got caught up seeking validation I had never gotten before in my life. She found out and it was hellish.

I’ve actually packed my things and left, but due to finances I would have to give up my life I’ve built to live in the middle of nowhere with drug addicted family. I can’t do that, so I’m still here. One of the girls who would talk to me in school respected my space when I told her I couldn’t talk to her anymore. I felt like that was something I’d never get from my partner, respect for my space.

I graduated, shifted into a relevant part time job, andI ended up contacting her again, basically risking horror all over again just to feel some sort of escape, I have no friends in this city at all, and leaving my partner while I am getting a second job would leave me homeless without a car. The other girl wants to get coffee with me, and I want to but also feel shame for even going for coffee. 

I feel awful because I have attraction to other women, because I feel like trash. I feel guilty because my partner says she wants to fix things and “keep going” but she won’t go to counseling, and still has very difficult emotional outbursts, except now she has more to blame me for. What makes me feel more dissonance is that it seems like she is trying, but it’s like in the form of small gestures, or “not fighting all the way.” I can’t tell if I am just a people pleaser or if I should actually give her more time. When I packed my things to stay with family it was the first time we had been apart for more than two days. She wanted me back, I did want her again but I also knew I want my budding career, and that I would sacrifice my happiness for the chance after being poor my entire life.

I feel so fucking lost, feel this awful and strange desire to “fix” things, but at the same time I feel like it’s not even in my control. The worst thing is, my familial support system is unreliable at best, and threatening to my life at worst. Some of the more stable members of my family are too poor to help me financially, and also barely speak to me.

I have been suicidal over this, have been to therapy, and it just feels fucking terrible. 

I never thought I would be living in such a cowardly way. Never thought I would be untrue to someone, or that I’d ever be put on hold during the holidays for a domestic abuse hotline. Never thought I’d apply to a homeless shelter, to be told there wasn’t room, or that I’d have seriously considered jumping from a bridge. Or that going to coffee with a beautiful person who wants to help and is aware of the situation would scare me so much. FML.",1,1734482199.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

You unexpectedly reached out this week, unfortunately for my current situation you reached out as more than a friend. Given our dynamic was FWB, it makes sense but where my life is now I can’t just ask to see you for coffee or the like. 

If I’m honest my only regret now is sleeping together I wish I’d kept you as my friend, platonic so we could remain in contact I would love to see you again. 

Harsh reality is you want more and I cannot give that, even in the future I don’t see that ending for us. That being said I have genuinely missed you, I would love to keep chatting and hear your witty one liners. 

After you reached out you have been on my mind a lot, it sucks that I can’t do anything about it.

I have been ruining my life since elementary school. At that time, I felt different from my friends. I felt that communicating with others was very difficult to do. I had extremely low self-confidence. My mind was very noisy and couldn’t stay still. I often heard whispers that made it take 3–5 hours for me to truly fall asleep. I would get lost in my thoughts, unable to focus or be aware of my surroundings. i often talk to myself and some of people think im weird.

Things got worse when I entered middle school. That’s when I was introduced to pornography and masturbation. You could say I developed quite a few addictions: masturbation, video games, coffee, and food. I spent my money on food and drinks. My time was consumed by video games. My parents thought I had no problems because I was a closed-off person. I often used my savings to buy things I needed but should have told my parents because I was afraid of burdening them—even though, at that time, we were financially sufficient, albeit not rich.

I tend to avoid conflict. I don’t have strong convictions. I socialize by mirroring the way the person I’m talking to behaves. I was often called arrogant because I stayed silent, but in truth, my mind was noisy and couldn’t form the right words. I kept wondering why I wasn’t as strong as most men my age. Every word people said to me affected my heart. My father often gave me expensive things and took us to restaurants on weekends, which confused me about my family’s financial situation.

I tried to get rid of all those addictions, but it was all in vain.

When I was 16, I experienced an unbearable headache. I had it checked at the time, but nothing was found (it was later diagnosed at age 19 as migraines that attack daily, 3-4 times a day)  and i cant do think or do something . After that, my father had a stroke, which changed my life. I temporarily stopped my treatment and tried to find alternative healing methods. But my common sense is clouded by uncontrollable emotions (caused of migraine too). I often broke my belongings because I felt helpless as I watched my parents argue and suffer in despair.

From ages 17 to 23, I really tried not to burden my family. I tried to learn many things when I should have focused on just one field. At that time, I realized our financial situation was not good. Then, at 20, I developed a problem with my eyes. I had it checked everywhere, but the results were normal. My mother recommended Lasik surgery, but it didn’t fix my condition. Now, I suffer from starburst vision, and the doctors couldn’t find a solution and just gave up.

This drove me even crazier, and I spent all my savings within a year buying medications, trying photography, and purchasing whatever I liked as a way to soothe myself while trying to find a side job. I made so many wrong decisions.

Now, at 23, I cannot keep up with my studies in my final year of university. I have no money left. I still have problems with my eyes. I have no job, and my family’s financial situation is broken because of me. I’ve often wondered why God gives trials when I am so weak.

1hgpaqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1hgpaqn/im_worried_ny_husband_is_a_serial_emotional/,I'm worried ny husband is a serial emotional cheater.,"Tl;dr husband has been emotionally cheating for years, lying about our life together, is now backtracking.

My husband (M33) has been having intimate conversations about me (33F) and our family to a woman he met online. We've been married for 10 years.

He has lied about our life together making it out that I'm never around and he has the kids all the time, he told her that I never put them to sleep and dump it on him while I go out and party....

I recommended that he started putting the kids to bed because he's always at work and thought the time brushing teeth would be a good connecting point.

I've been a SAHM for most of this relationship. About 18 months ago, I started making some time for myself now that our kids are in school. Nothing crazy. I go out to eat with friends and have been on a couple of girls trips. My first time traveling in nine years. 

The friend he made online is trans. He confessed to her that he's bisexual and apparently told his therapist he is, too.

He's been having sexual conversations with men online.

The friend made a comment about yandere women and he said, oh like my wife? 

He has been shitting on me for the last 8-10 months in these conversations saying he should have divorced me a long time ago.

Backstory: when I was pregnant I discovered the first woman he was having an emotional connection with....he deleted the conversations and said it was nothing inappropriate, but how would I know? The next year, I discovered he had made another close female friend online and had sent a different woman money for coffee.... I was pregnant with our second. 

A few months after that, I had an emotional affair with my ex and I almost left my husband. Previously, my ex and I would have brief catch ups, but we kept them platonic. I went to therapy and decided to stay in my marriage and give it another chance. 

When I confronted my husband about the recent messages with his friend, he said he felt guilty and didn't want me to see the conversations as he didn't feel that way anymore. That the explicit messages with the guys were just funny, not serious. He doesn't really think he's bisexual.... backtracking on all of it. He also has had a lot of flirtatious encounters with coworkers with one showing him her nipple piercings through her shirt and one time he picked her up under her arms from behind to move her out of the way..

He says he wanted a safe place to say some thoughts out loud - he has no friends in real life. So I understand this part, I have said thoughts out loud to see how they land and realized I didn't believe them. He is telling me that saying them made him realize that I am his priority and the family and that he wants to be in this relationship.

But it took me finding these conversations first..

I need advice. 
I am completely heartbroken and confused

I am feeling sick.
I don't trust him or believe that he, all of a sudden, had a change of heart?

But, I really want to believe him. We have grown up together and have young children. 
I want to recover and reconcile. 

What do I do now?

Seems like it needed to be really long to create a story or something.The longer to explain everything the better. 

You think the killer would write it after they had her. Or come prepared. They were in the house. They wrote it there, practiced,  went to kidnap, got the child, laid the pages on the steps, took her down to the basement, she woke up screaming, so they clocked her on the head. Then fashioned a garrote because they're crazy, then ran away in hi tech boots in the snow, abandoning the note, skinny enough not to disturb the cobwebs, or they grew back whatever. 

Patsy wakes up goes to get coffee, John is still asleep. Patsy reads the, goes to check her in her bed. She's not there. Is horrified. Calls the police. Calls all the neighbors and family friends. Sits in the living room isn't going around the room, calling for her just believes the note. Isn't too worried about Burke? 

If there was no note, maybe they would have searched the rest of the house instead of believing it. ",4,1734481874.0,JonBenetRamsey,2,1.0,False

1hgp5pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1hgp5pd/has_anyone_heard_of_the_travelers_road/,Has anyone heard of the travelers road? ,"Have you ever come out of a daydream to realize you were driving? That you had ended up somewhere that requires making turns and stops, but you can't really remember making those turns or stops. You just suddenly realize, holy shit, I'm driving.  Well, that's how it started. 

 I was on my way home from college for the holidays. It was a drive I had made half a dozen times at this point. So, naturally I had become pretty familiar with the road. My mind was somewhere a million miles away, when I finally noticed the road ahead of me. I looked down at my hands on the steering wheel, I had been gripping it like a vice. The clock on my dash read 12:00 AM.  

“Shit.” How long had I been driving on auto pilot? I tried to remember but my mind felt so groggy. The last thing I could remember was flying down the road, jamming out to paranoid by black sabbath. Now though, nothing looked familiar. I was seriously tired, I needed to stop and get an energy drink or something. I looked further on up the road but beyond the headlights was just pure blackness, hopefully there would be a gas station or something within the next few miles, I seriously needed a pick me up. 

After a few more miles, and no sign of civilization I began to wonder where the hell I actually was. I should have been on Highway 9, which was the last stretch before I made it back home. At least that's where I thought I should have been. But, the farther I drove, the longer the empty darkness went on, the more convinced I became that somewhere along the way I had made a wrong turn. 

I reached into my pocket for my phone, but it wasn't there. Confused, I began to search around the inside of my car, but all I could see was a few discarded food wrappers and a half drank bottle of Gatorade. I decided to pull over and search for the little black dependency brick. I had never been very navigationally inclined. Honestly, I think I depend on google maps entirely too much, but right now I didn't care. I was lost and needed directions. After about 5 minutes of scrounging around under the seats and between the center console, I realized my phone was gone. I had no idea where I had lost it, maybe I had left it back at my dorm or maybe it fell out of my pocket somewhere, I didn't know. The only thing to do now, I guessed, was to just keep on driving and hope I find somewhere to stop and ask for directions. 

I reached down to turn up the radio but was met with only silence. I sighed, the radio in my car had crapped out on me a while back and I thought I had fixed it, apparently not well enough though. The next hour or so of driving was going to be mind numbingly dull without tunes. I glanced down at the clock on the dash and sighed, oh great, I thought, now the clock is busted too. The numbers still showed 12:00 AM. 

 I shook my head, “Baby, I love you, but you have some serious issues.”  

My car was my pride and joy, even if she had seen better days. A 1991 Camaro Rs, it was white with red racing stipes. The paintjob was custom but had seen better days, not to mention that the radiator was held together with JB weld, and it had over 200,000 miles on the engine. Needless to say, the old girl could use some TLC, that is, when I could afford it. I shrugged off my worries about the time and the radio and kept on driving. 

Eventually, up ahead in the distance, I thought I could make out a faint light. As I drove on, the solitary beacon grew brighter and brighter. A lighthouse shining in a sea of night. After what felt like miles and miles, the light finally resolved into a bright neon sign. The sign had a long green snake looped around fiery red words, The Midway Saloon. 

I pulled into the parking, and thought it looked about like any other dive bar I had ever seen. There were a handful of classic cars and Harley Davidsons parked out front, but the thing that stood out the most was standing there hitched to a post staring at me. It wasn't too unusual to see horses at bars, this was the south after all. But this horse was different, it was absolutely massive, solid black with a gleaming black saddle. The way the big animals' eyes reflected the light, almost seemed to make them glow.  

I parked next to an old Cadilac and stepped out onto the gravel lot. The warm air seemed to grow cooler under the giant horses' gaze, it watched me all the way to the door, the glow in its eyes never faltering.  Stepping through the saloon doors, I was met with the familiar smell of cigarette smoke and spilled beer. A jukebox in the corner played a song I had heard at least a hundred times but for some reason I couldn't place it, the patrons played pool, darts and leaned against the bar talking loudly.  

The bartender looked up from behind the bar. He was a big guy in a crisp white shirt and rolled up sleeves, he had a bushy beard and dark slicked back hair. He put down the glass he had been cleaning and met my eyes. 

“New around here huh? Well, what can I get you?” 

I nodded, “Uh yeah. Actually, I'm just passing through, but I'm not really sure where here is.” 

He smiled and shook his head, “Passing through. Thats a good one.”  

I sat down at the bar and ordered a beer, “So, I'm trying to get to Highway 9, but I think I made a wrong turn somewhere. Could you tell me how to get to where I need to be?” 

The bartender shook his head and sat the beer in front of me, “No, I can't tell you that. I can tell you however, you are a long way from where you want to be.” 

“What does that mean?” I asked. 

The big man just smiled and went back to cleaning the same glass. I glanced around the bar, noticing the way the people were dressed. It was like some crazy decades party or something. In one corner I saw a guy dressed like a 1950s greaser, playing darts with a guy who looked like an 90s punk rocker, blue mohawk and everything. At the other end of the bar sat what looked like a Wallstreet banker talking with a couple civil war reenactors.  

“You all having a costume party or something?” I asked the bartender. 

 He just smiled at me again and continued cleaning the glass. I shook my head and took a sip of my beer. 

Glancing around the bar again, I noticed a man sitting alone in one dark corner. He had a long black coat and a wide brimmed cowboy hat. “Is that the guy who owns that beast of a horse out there?” I asked, motioning to the man. 

The bartender stopped cleaning the glass as the bar went silent. I could feel every eye in the room fixed on me. Almost every eye. I looked around at the people surrounding me, then to the back of the room, where the man sat alone. His dark hat tilted up as he looked at me, he had the same cold glow in his eyes I had seen in the horse outside. I felt a chill run up my spine and my skin grew hot under that gaze. He didn't just look at me, he looked into me. It was like he could see down to my soul, to the very fiber of my being. I felt panic rising from nowhere. 

Just then I felt an iron grip on my arm. I turned away from that unnatural gaze and looked at the bartender. 

“You had best be on your way son.”  

I nodded and stood up from the bar, “Uh, which way do I go?” I asked. 

His face took on a grim countenance, “Just keep following the road.” 

I nodded, “What do I owe you for the beer?”  

Smiling warmly again he said, “First ones always free.” 

I frowned at that and he went back to cleaning the glass. As he did, the commotion of the bar resumed, as if it had never stopped. 

I stepped out of the strange saloon and avoided looking at the horse as I made my way back to my car. I just needed to get back on the road, and away from whatever the hell that was. Pulling back onto the blacktop I quickly left The Midway Saloon far behind me. 

 I had been driving for what felt like hours at this point, where the hell was I? How could I have become so lost?  

Just then I saw something up ahead in the distance. At first it was just vague dark shapes against more darkness, but as I got closer the shapes resolved into buildings and houses. It was a town. As the town came into focus, my exhausted brain caught up with what seemed so out of place. It was a town with no lights.  

“What the hell?”  

The road I was on led right down the center of the dark town. As I slowed down, I looked from side to side at the buildings lining the street. The buildings looked old, made of dark red brick and wood, but they weren't run down or abandoned just empty and dark.  

There were streetlights but none of them were on. I didn't see any other cars in the town either. Come to think of it, I hadn't seen any other cars all night.  

I pulled my car to a stop at the center of town and rolled down my window. The sound of my car's engine reverberated through the town; it seemed so incredibly loud in the utter emptiness. I killed the engine and stepped out onto the dark empty road. My headlights were still on and out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw something move out of the beam. I turned to look for whatever, or whoever was there. But I didn't see anything. 

“Hello?” I shouted.  

The echo of my voice bounced around and distorted before going silent. After a moment more of silence, I began to get back into my car when I heard it. 

“Hello?” 

Goosebumps rose on my skin. As I whipped around, looking for the answering voice. The voice that sounded almost exactly like mine. My eyes scanned the darkness, but I couldn't see anyone. This was wrong, this place it felt wrong. I couldn't understand it but I felt eyes on me from every direction, just like back at the bar. But I couldn't see anyone. 

“Hello?” I whispered under my breath.  

The moment stretched as the silence of the town seemed to swallow the sound of my voice.  

“Hello?” A voice whispered back. 

I spun and jumped into my car, my heart pounding. The voice had been right behind me, I could swear I felt a warm breath on my neck. I frantically rolled the window up and looked around for the voice but there was no one there. I reached for the ignition and turned the key, but the damn thing wouldn't start. 

Suddenly a streetlight at the end of the block started flickering on and off.  Standing directly under the light was a man. I couldn't make out many details at this distance but what I could see chilled me to the bone. His clothes hung on him like rags and his skin looked cracked and dark, like charcoal. He stood there crookedly, staring at me. When the light flickered back out, he was gone. I could still see the darkened streetlight but the man had disappeared, he was just gone. I turned the key again and again, 

“Fucking come on!” I shouted. 

When the streetlight flickered back on, I could see the man again, only this time he wasn't alone. There was at least a dozen charred figures standing under the light now. They jerkily moved and shifted towards me as the light flickered 

“Fucking come on!” The all shouted, in my voice. 

I watched in horror as they broke into a run just as the light flickered back out. 

Finally, the engine roared to life and I slammed it into gear. As I tore through the dark town my headlights illuminated dozens more charred figures. Their skeletal hands reached out for me as I blazed past them, I could hear their nails scratching into my cars paint as I passed them by. I accelerated faster out of the town and back onto the long dark road. 

My head was spinning, they weren't real, they can't be real. I could barely see straight, I briefly thought about heading back to The Midway but I couldn't stop. Real or not, I had to get away from that town. I had to keep driving, the only problem was, I could no longer tell how long I have been driving; time seemed strange. I stared down at the gas gage and prayed it was broken also; I couldn't remember how long I had been on half a tank. The road and the endless darkness beyond it seemed to stretch on for eternity,

 After another indeterminate time of driving, trees began appearing sporadically along the sides of the road. Eventually they grew in numbers until both sides of the road were heavily forested. 

The road began to twist and wind, what was once a long, straight stretch of emptiness was now a serpentine path through towering trees and woodlands. I was truly lost, but I couldn't bring myself to turn around, to face those things in that town again.  

When I came around the next curve, I slammed hard on my brakes. Right in front of me was a large old iron bridge. My mind raced; this was the first time the road had deviated from being anything but blacktop. I shook the feeling off, it was just a road. A very long uninhabited road. 

I stepped out of my car and looked around at the surrounding forest. It was so quiet, there should have at least been animal noises, right? Crickets, owls, coyotes, something. But there was absolutely no sound. 

I walked toward the old bridge; I wasn't sure it would be safe to drive across, I needed to get a closer look before trusting it to hold. My footsteps echoed through the forest as I stepped up to where the asphalt met the wooden planks of the bridge. The stared down, the dark pristine asphalt gave way to rotted looking wood. I cautiously extended my foot and placed it down onto the wood. The step seemed louder than it should have been and echoed down into whatever was below the bridge. It seemed sturdy enough, so I walked out onto it testing the structure by jumping up and down.  

“Is someone there?” 

I froze. It was a woman's voice, and it came from under the bridge.  

“Hello? Is... Is someone there?” she called. 

I turned as quietly as I could, began to make my way back to my car. The voice wasn't a mimic of mine this time, but I still didn't trust anyone who hung around under bridges. I made it three steps before the boards creaked under my step. 

The womans voice came again, “Hello? I need help. Please, I'm hurt.” 

I swallowed hard, the voice sounded sincere. What if it was someone like me, lost on this road and trapped down there? How could I just leave her down there? I decided to take a chance. 

“Hello. I'm here. Where are you?” 

The voice sighed in relief, “Oh thank God. I'm down here, under the bridge, I fell off and my leg is pinned under a rock. Can you please come down and help me?” 

“Okay.” I said, “Let me go get a flashlight from my car. Is there a path down I can use to get to you?” 

“Yes, I can see a path down. Just follow the sound of my voice.” 

I hurried to my car and grabbed a heavy Maglite from my trunk. Luckily the batteries were still good, and I was able to find the path that led below the bridge, “Okay, I'm coming.” 

“Please hurry, I've been down here so long. No one would stop to help me.” 

I was halfway down the path and paused, “You’ve seen other cars on the road?” I asked. 

The voice was silent for a moment, then she said, “Please hurry, it hurts.”  

“One minute” I said, “I think I have a first aid kit in the car. I'll just run grab it really quick.”  

“NO!” The voice shouted in anger before softening again, “Just come a little closer, I can see your light, you're almost there.” 

From where I was standing, the bridge blocked my view underneath it, but if I knelt down, I would be able to see. Slowly I bent down and shined my flashlight across the rocks under the bridge. 

“Thats it.” said the voice, “A little farther.” 

I panned the light to the left and saw a scrap of dirty white cloth. I stepped forward, looking closer. The cloth was part of an old stained dress. The womans body lay brokenly among the rocks under the bridge. She looked like she had been dead for some time. When my light shined on the womans face, she smiled. Her smile spread wider and wider and her eyes took on a manic excitement. 

“You found me.” She said, before bending straight up at the waist, her joints cracking like old kindling. 

As I began to back away, she leapt to all fours and darted toward me. I turned and ran as fast as I could up the hill and back to my car. My heart pounding. I could hear her right behind me, her hands and feet scrambling across the ground like a deranged spider. 

Just before I made it to my car, I felt an impact on my back. She was on me, biting and scratching. I fell to the ground and rolled across the road throwing her off of me. I jumped to my feet just as she lunged at me. I leapt back and swung the heavy Maglite, striking her in the head. She recoiled in pain and fell to the ground, sobbing.  

“Please don't hurt me. I just needed help.” She cried, holding her hands up in defense. 

I stepped back in confusion, “What? You attacked me!” I shouted.  

“No, I just needed help. And you hit me.” She sobbed. 

I shook my head, “I'm not doing this, just stay back and I'll leave.”   

I stepped back away from her to my car and opened the door. I only took my eyes off of her for a second, and suddenly she was on me again. Slapping the flashlight away and knocking me to the ground. She dug her nails into my shoulders and chest as she tried to bite my face. Her eyes bulged and her teeth were impossibly large and jagged. I couldn't push her off of me so I wrapped my hands around her neck and squeezed as tightly as I could, fear and adrenaline running through me. I squeezed my eyes closed and kept up the pressure until finally she slowly stopped fighting and went limp.  

I flung the body off of me and looked at it in horror. In death, she just looked like a normal woman, dirty and beaten, but normal. And I had killed her. I bent over and puked, disgusted and horrified at what I had just done. 

I had to get out of here, as I turned to get back into the car, the dead woman behind me started laughing. Looking back at the body, I could see she was still laying there. The toothy smile back in place, but her eyes were completely vacant. 

“Please don't hurt me.” She laughed. 

My breaths came quicker and quicker, ""What the fuck are you?”  

Her head turned to face me as her smile spread even wider. “I’m what you will become.”  

In an instant she was back on her feet and wrapping her hands around my neck. I felt my feet leave the ground as he squeezed my throat, tighter and tighter. 

I choked and kicked but I couldn't break free. Her jaw unhinged and stretched, revealing row after row of jagged, serrated teeth. I couldn't believe it, this was the end, and I didn't even understand what was happening. 

Just as consciousness started to fade, I heard a boom, like a thunderclap as a flash lit up the sky. I fell to the ground, choking and gagging. One of the woman things arms still holding onto my throat. I managed to pry it loose and looked up to see the stunned look on her face. Another boom lit up the sky and a burning hole appeared between the things eyes just before she crumpled to the ground in a pile of ash.  

I stood and looked back up the road, but I couldn't see anything. I heard him first, heavy footsteps accompanied by the jingle of spurs. Then out of the darkness, a pair of cold glowing eyes.  He was coming, and I wasn't waiting around to see what he wanted. I just needed to get the hell out of there. I jumped over the smoldering ash pile and into my car. I stomped on the gas pedal and tore across the bridge, praying I would find a way off of this fucking road. 

As I left the forested area, I pressed the accelerator even harder. The needle on the speedometer rose to 85 then to 100 then 120, I put the pedal to the floor and screamed out all of my fear, anger and frustration, “AAAAAHHHHHH!!!”  

 

Time and miles passed in a haze, I never stopped. Several times I came to places on the road where someone or something wanted me to stop. A tree in the road, a hitchhiker waving for me to stop, another rickety bridge. None of it mattered, I had to keep going. I’d swerve around or drive over whatever was in my way. My car took a beating, but she never stopped.  

I saw the horseman a few more times; I think he even chased after me once. I didn't care I just sped on. Whatever this place was it had an end somewhere, a way out or a way back, or something. I just had to keep driving...driving...driving...

 

I started woke up in the parking lot of a cafe. Glancing around I saw several cars in the lot and a big sign out front that said Al’s. Through the window. I could see several people inside sitting and eating, and going about their business. 

Had it all been a dream? Yeah, yeah of course it was a dream. A long terrible dream. I stepped out of my car and made my way to the door, I felt groggy and exhausted, that way you do after a restless night of sleep. I pushed open the cafe door and heard the bell jingle. Sitting at the counter I motioned to the waitress and she came over.  

“Hey Hun, what’ll it be?”  

I smiled up at her, “I could use a coffee.”  

She nodded, “Coming right up.” 

Setting a white mug on the counter, she filled it to the brim with the steaming beverage. I inhaled the aroma and smiled. I couldn't believe I was finally out of that nightmare. 

“You don't fucking belong here.” 

I looked up at the waitress, “Excuse me?” 

“I said, do you want sugar with that?” she said grinning down at me. 

I blinked in confusion, “uh... No. No, I don't.”  

The waitress smiled and nodded before turning back to the kitchen. I must still be a little out of it. I thought.  

Shaking my head I took a sip from the mug and immediately spit it out. The coffee, it... it tasted like... I couldn't even bring myself to think it. I looked down at the mug, and felt my stomach drop. What had just been a cup full of dark warm coffee, was now filled to the brim with a dark red liquid that smelled like copper and rot.  

I stumbled back from the counter, gagging and knocking over the stool, as the cafe erupted into laughter. I looked around at the cackling faces as the vile liquid in the mug began to poor over the brim and continued flowing out onto the floor, like some macabre fountain.  “No...” I was still on that fucking road.  

Just as I was about to turn and run for my car, every single person in the diner stood up as one and turned to face me. The laughing stopped and their smiles were replaced with an expression of pure hatred. Then they began to speak.  

A trucker in the corner, “You’re a unique one...” 

The waitress behind the counter, “We don't get one like you here often...” 

A little girl in a booth, “Not nearly often enough...”  

An elderly man at the counter, “The half ways always...” 

A young woman at the register, “Taste...” 

The cook by the flat top, “So...” 

A mother of three by the door, “Much...” 

All as one, “Sweeter.” 

I stood there, petrified as the moment stretched. I have to get out of here, now. I ran for it; I was going to shove and punch and kick every single one of these fuckers out of my way if I had to.  

I didn't make it past the first one. It was a middle-aged balding man, who looked like he weighed maybe 120ibs. I tried to shove him and run past, but his skin was like one of those sticky mouse traps and my arm got immediately stuck against his face. I tried to rip myself free but the others began closing in around me, their hands reaching out to take hold of me. I could feel dozens of hands sticking to me and pulling from every direction, I didn't know what would break first, my body or my mind. I screamed in fear, and the assembly howled in joy.  

Just as I thought I would be ripped limb from limb, thunder boomed through the diner over and over again. The tacky hands began falling away, and I collapsed to the floor. As I lay there trying to catch my breath, I felt a different set of hands of me. Large, ice-cold hands. I felt myself being pulled to my feet and dragged through the diner and out into the parking lot. 

As I was thrown to the ground, I looked up at my savior and winced under the glare of those eyes. This was the closest I had seen him, and it was horrible. His skin was pale and sunken, like an aging corpse. And his white hair hung in strands down to his shoulders.  

He glared down at me and pointed one long finger, “Stay.” 

His voice was deep and gravely, full of both age and power. He turned and started back to the diner pulling two massive revolvers from his belt. 

Through the window of the cafe. I saw the corpses climbing to their feet, most of them had large chunks missing from their bodies. One after another, the bodies began falling into each other. They clumped together in a fleshy gore coated mass, arms and legs and mouths jutting out in all directions. The mass began shifting its way to the door, all of the thing's eyes were still fixed on me. The pale gunslinger kicked the door open and began firing both thundering revolvers, knocking the thing back and blowing off massive chunks of smoldering flesh. 

 I didn't stay to watch the rest. Even though he had saved my ass twice now, he still filled me with a kind of dread that was all consuming. I jumped to my feet and ran around the massive black horse between me and my car. I cranked the engine to life and floored it away from the cafe and on down the road. I kept driving... and driving... and driving... 

Time lost all meaning, I never got hungry, never got thirsty, never stopped driving. I believed that I had found my way to hell. My suspicion was confirmed hundreds of miles later, when I saw a bright neon sign up ahead in the distance...  The Midway. 

I stood there on the gravel lot, staring up at the sign. The glow of the neon painting the night in shades of red and green. Only now could I see the snake for what it really was, an ouroboros. The paradoxical serpent, forever eating its own tail. There was no end to the road. No end. No beginning. Just an eternal loop of misery and darkness. I stared at the sign, my eyes following the coils of the snake around and around. My mind cracked even further and I began to laugh. I doubled over and fell to the ground laughing harder and harder and for a while I just slipped away... 

I don't know how long I lay there like that. After a time, I came back to myself. Sitting up from the cold ground and climbing to my feet, I made my way to the door and pushed through it. 

The bar tender looked up from wiping down the bar top, “Back so soon?” 

I numbly walked over to the bar, sat down on a stool and met his eyes, “I have been driving for days. Maybe even weeks. I can't even fucking tell anymore.” 

The bartender nodded, “Weeks, months, years...” 

My eyes had dropped to the bat top, but shot back up at his words. Had it really been that long?  

He noticed my panic and chuckled, “They're just words. They don't really mean anything here.” 

“So... Is this hell?” I asked  

He laughed, “No, it aint hell. It's just the road.” 

I shook my head in confusion, “But what is the road?” 

The bartender studied me for a moment before answering, “Well, some have called it purgatory, or limbo. But it aint really that either. This is the traveler's road, its where the lost souls of travelers end up.” 

My heart dropped, “So, I am dead.” 

He shrugged, “Not entirely. I couldn't see it before but there is still a thread of life within you.” 

“Wait, what? I'm still alive?” 

He shrugged again, “Partially, your life is in the balance as we speak.  I reckon that's why the Rider has such an interest in you.” 

“Why would that interest him? What is he?” I asked. 

“What he is, I don't rightly know. Around here, we just call him “The Rider”.  What I do know, is that he is a hunter. He wanders through all worlds and finds things that don't belong... and removes them. You not being fully dead, don't fully belong here. So, he isn't quite sure what to do with you.” 

I thought about the woman from the bridge and how he reduced her to a pile of ash. Would that be my fate? I didn't think so. He had his chance to end me on the road, instead he protected me. 

“On the road, there were things. Things that tried to kill me... 

He nodded, “The unnaturals. Vengeful souls that died of unnatural or supernatural causes. They feed off of pain and fear.” 

I swallowed a lump in my throat and asked, “What would have happened if they killed me?”  

His face turned grim, ""Then you would stay here and become one of them.” 

I shuttered thinking of the people in the diner. Were they lost souls too once?  I didn't think I wanted to know the answer. 

“If I die, will I stay here?” 

He smiled sadly, “I wish I could tell you, you'd move on. But I don't know. My guess is that since you wound up here in the first place, this is where you'll be.” 

I shook my head, “But why?” 

“Kid, I still don't know why I'm here. Some people do move on from the road, but not many and not often. It's one of life and deaths great mysteries.” 

Just then I heard the snorting of a horse from outside, followed by heavy, spurred footsteps. I turned to face the door just as it swung open. As the Rider entered the barroom the temperature dropped. I felt goosebumps on my skin as I stood and met his gaze.  

“Thank you.” I said my voice trembling, I took a steadying breath and started again. “Thank you, for helping me.”  

He stared down at me with that terror inducing gaze. The moment stretched but I didn't look away. Eventually, the Rider gave a small grunt and a nod of his head before turning and heading to his seat in the back of the bar. 

I turned back to sit back at the bar when I felt myself growing increasingly dizzy. My vision began to blur and I spun and fell to the floor. For a moment all I could see was the dim bulb hanging from the ceiling. But then the bulb grew brighter and brighter, until all I could see was a blinding white light and my ears were filled with a deafening ringing.  

Eventually I was able to make out a distant voice, “Hey. Hey Kid, can you hear me?” 

I tried to speak but, I had no voice. 

“If you can hear me, follow the light.” 

I did, or at least I tried to.  

“Good.” Said the voice. “Can you tell me your name?” 

I blinked over and over again. My eyes were so dry.  

“Hey, I think he's coming out of it.” The voice was calling to someone else.  

Reality slammed back into place. I was on my back, with a flashlight in my face, surrounded by paramedics. I turned my head to look around. Someone told me not to move, but I had to see. My car was wrapped around a tree about 20 feet away.  

“What time is it?” I asked. 

The paramedic leaning over me looked down at her watch and said, “12:01.” 

I felt tears burning in my eyes, I was alive. 

“You must have been having some dream.” Said the paramedic as I was loaded into the ambulance. “You were talking about bars and monsters and gunslingers. I think I would have liked to see that.” 

I smiled, despite the pain I was in, “Yeah, some dream. I'm just glad it's over.” 

It was a dream, wasn't it? Thats what I tell myself anyway, it had to be a dream. The heavy, jingling footsteps I heard as they closed the ambulance doors were just in my head. Weren't they?

Did anyone else go here? 🏕️🍦Soft serve ice cream at any meal including breakfast in the cafeteria (no kid could forget),"Update: ok, I put in a little elbow grease and armchair detective work and I have identified that the camp was Camp Victory near Andalusia, AL. Any Camp Victory alumns here?

The story:

So yeah, when I was in 6th grade I was sent away to a youth camp for a week. I thought I would describe my experience and see if it sounds familiar to any of you.

I was so young that I really don’t know what city or town I was in but I grew up in the Florida Panhandle and I think it was somewhere in Alabama about 2 hours away, so southern or central Alabama. 


The camp was on a lake and had several different housing and other structures on it (and I know at first this is gonna sound like a lot of camps, bear with me). The lake had trampolines and water slides on it. The cafeteria was huge for a camp and it notably had a soft serve ice cream machine which you were allowed to use at any meal including breakfast. You could also have coffee at any meal regardless of your age 😅. We stayed in dorms that were a lot like college dorms. I remember thinking the buildings were ugly and the interiors were very drab like an old motel. 

It was a little hilly and there was a nature walk around the edge of the campus. 

And then at the particular camp I was sent to, we had to go to chapel like 3 times a day, and they were always working us into an emotional frenzy where everyone in the room was weeping… 3 times a day. 

I think fondly of the lake and the ice cream sometimes 😅

oh and I went to Christian Life Church in Milton Florida (anyone else? 👀)

So anyway, does this happen to sound familiar to any of you? Thanks for reading!",3,1734481275.0,Exvangelical,5,1.0,False
1hgp2m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1hgp2m5/am_i_eating_enough_calories/,Am I eating enough calories?,"My stats: Female, 33yrs old, starting weight 159, current weight 154, goal weight 130. Just started fasting 2 weeks ago. 

A little context: I’ve never been a breakfast person, ever. However for a lotttt of years I was addicted to monster energy drinks (I just liked the taste of them, would rarely actually finish a whole one) or I would drink a really sugary drink from Dunkin or Starbucks in the morning. That was my “breakfast”. Then I’d usually have one meal, maybe 2 later in the day. However for my entire adult life I’ve never eaten “well”. I would eat fast food or junk and a lotttt of sweets. My metabolism didn’t slow down until about a year and half ago when I finally went off birth control after being on it for years. I do feel as though I have a hormonal imbalance and/or PCOS. Also during the first 1-2 years of COVID I went through a lot of depression and anxiety (not only covid but I went through a divorce) and when I suffer with that I just don’t eat. I feel physically ill when I even smell food. It’s like a bottomless pit in my stomach and the thought of food makes me want to vomit. So there were times where I dropped A LOT of weight very quickly. Like at one point I got down to 100lbs and had to force myself to eat. So I’m sure that really messed up my metabolism and it started taking effect around the beginning of last year, especially when I went off BC cold turkey. 

Fast forward to present: I’ve hated the way I look for sometime now and finally decided enough was enough and started with my intermittent fasting journey about 2 weeks ago. I’ve completely cut out sugar, fast foods, processed foods, etc. I’ve been cooking every day and I only drink water and black coffee (which I actually love surprisingly). I started out with 16:8 (more like 17:7). Then as of this past Sunday (so for the last 3 days) I’ve been doing 23:1 and basically OMAD. I find myself not as hungry but not content enough to not eat anything at all and continue my fast. Like I’ll actually be pretty hungry at the 23-24hr mark so I do feel the need to eat a meal. But for example, my meal last night and tonight consisted of like 500 calories. And I’m full. I don’t really feel the need to eat anything else and that holds me over until the next day. The last couple days I’ve also been riding the bike in the gym (5-7 miles) and walking on the treadmill for 1-2 miles. I’m already in a very clear calorie deficit, but then add the exercise in. 

My questions is, do I force myself to eat more? I’ve read that I probably shouldn’t be eating less than 1200 calories but I just don’t want it. I don’t feel seasoned enough yet with IF to do more than 24hrs tho. I’ve read The Obesity Code and currently reading Life in the Fasting Lane. I’m doing all I can to educate myself. But I’m just unclear on this.",2,1734481229.0,intermittentfasting,3,1.0,False

Silver locked hair and eyes of gray. Only a few teeth; all which carried a deep glint of yellow. He had skin like oiled leather, and wrinkles that seemed too prevalent for his age. The sting of his body odor and human waste protruded from the dingy clothes that he called home. He couldn’t say much, but you’d imagine the belligerent tantrums such a man might impose on common folk. His cheeks where surprisingly round, and his chin was hidden by a chaotic display of facial hair. He laid motionless on the park bench. Covered in a long green coat, I was surprised anyone even noticed. How could they notice? No one ever notices, and yet this time things where different. Unfortunately, adults tend to stray away from reality more than children do. As we grow older, we become increasingly aware of the horrors of our day. In response, we hide such things from our psyche, and pretend their existence is purely illusionary. However; the man I locked eyes with, was no illusion. The strongest whiskey failed to wash his face from my memory. Until death, there is no freedom from this man.

She was no less than 6 years old, and yet she saw more than most adults. Why was she the one to notice? Why, oh God, was she the one to see him? Bright blonde hair, and eyes of blue. Her baby teeth where still prominent. She was innocent. 

“Let’s start with your name dear.”

“Susanne”

“Susanne…”

“Sorry! Susanne Briggly.”

“Now, Susanne, could you start from the beginning?” 

	\-For the sake of grammar, I’ll paraphrase-

	Susanne and her mother walked Hamilton park nearly every Saturday. It was a ritualistic time for the two, since weekdays where reserved for school and work. 

“How often did you see this man during y'all's walks?”

	They saw the man every saturday; usually fumbling around trash cans for spare food, or laying on his bench. It’s important to acknowledge that it is HIS BENCH, for no other person dared to sit there. The man was not exactly dangerous, but his demeanor was off-putting and aggressive in tone.

“Did you or your mother ever interact with this man?

	Susanne specifically, interacted with the man nearly every saturday. She would make a note to always bring an extra sandwich and water, yet she only gave him food. Money, from either her mom or her, was too scarce to give away. Usually, he would thank her, and Susanne would carry on.

“So, you where offering him food as usual. What then?”

	Susanne walked up to his bench, greeted him, and offered her a gift. He gave no response in return.

“Excuse me sir, I have your sandwich. We where out of turkey, but I hope ham and cheese is ok.”

No response…

\-Her mom stood distracted in the distance, feeding the local ducks and squirrels.-

“Sir?”

She pushed him slightly, to wake him.

“SIRR! HELLO!”

Confused and frustrated by his deep slumber, she tore back his coat only to see… Only to see what no soul ought to have seen.

Susanne, paused for a second. The look on her face began to fall, and tears began to stream yet her mouth failed to quiver. Such youth so quickly lost. What repair can be offered except time and concealment?

“Susanne… Everything is going to be ok. Let’s continue this tomorrow. I’m sure you and your mother could use some rest and a nice warm meal.”

\-I pulled a $20 bill from my coat, and handed it to Susanne's mother. Bending down, I said with a smile-

“Here, grab some food on me. There’s a local diner down the street. Ask for Angela, and mention my name to her. I heard she likes to give away free milkshakes!” 

\-The tears subsided, and with sad eyes she replied-

“Do..,  do they have Strawberry?”

“The best in Chicago!”

	A smile ran across her face, and her eyes lifted up to her mother.

“Oh mommy, please please please, can we go!”

“Well it’ll be wrong of us to pass on free milkshakes. Thank you detective, what time should we be here tomorrow?”

“Same time tomorrow would be just fine. Have a nice dinner Mrs. Briggly.” 

	Little Susanne and her mother motioned out the door. Tonight, they will begin their lifelong journey of suppressing this horrible memory. It was nice to see a flicker of childlike innocence still lingering within her, yet I know facades only last until the morning. Then the process starts all over again. Such trauma often visits our dreams, leaving us to wake in a pool of sweat and tears. Panic consumes us, and the memories flood our mind once again. Nevertheless, we press on with a morning routine whose sole purpose is to distract. 

	It’s getting late, and my investigation has only just begun. I brewed up a hot cup of coffee, and prepared for a long and strenuous night.

The idea is to scan for nearby BLE devices (like iPhones, Androids, Apple Watches) and use their RSSI values to count how many people are in line. The goal is to calculate an estimated wait time, assuming each person takes 3 minutes to be served.

Here’s the basic plan:

	1.	Use BLE scanning to detect devices.

	2.	Filter devices based on RSSI to ensure only those in close proximity are counted ( in lineup)

	3.	Connect the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi to send data to a server.

	4.	Send a JSON payload with the number of devices and the estimated wait time to a webpage or backend for display.


Is this a feasible approach? What challenges should I anticipate with BLE device detection and RSSI-based filtering in a dynamic environment like a coffee shop? Are there better ways to improve accuracy or alternative methods I should consider?

Her and my dad, Andrew (76M) have been together for 32 years. Their relationship started a couple months after my mother and my father separated. My mother always had full custody of me, except one weekend a month. From the start, Karen was cold at best and was constantly criticizing what I did. Very early on (let me remind you, I was 8 years old when they started dating), she would show signs of jealousy towards me. She would make comments because I hugged my father. She was telling my father that he needed to pay more attention to her. She would get mad at me for using the decorative garbage can as a garbage can, if I lost some hair in the bathroom or when I didn’t bring my bath towel from my mother’s place. She didn’t like to have extra laundry to do when I visited. 


The thing is, she wasn’t always bad. She gave me gifts sometimes, she would bring me shopping, but the nice treatment never lasted long. She would complain about me to my dad all the time. 
I should have stopped going to my dad at a certain point. But my mom thought having a relationship with my dad was important and I craved validation and love from Andrew and Karen. But no matter how much work I would put to improve the relationship, it was never enough. At least Andrew was constant by picking me up when he was supposed to. My older half brother, Joe (47M) wasn’t so lucky; our dad ""forgot"" to pick him up multiple times when he was supposed to. Andrew would always prioritize hobbies such as golf, social dancing and bowling over his children. 
After a lot of work in therapy, I’ve accepted the fact that I wasn’t the problem and that I needed to keep Andrew at a distance emotionally, so I don’t get hurt. 


Fast forward to about a year ago. Andrew had to be operated and there were unforeseen complications. They had to reopen him, and put him in a coma for 48 hours. He was in ICU for 5 days. He stayed in the hospital for 3 weeks total. During all that time, Karen barely gave any news of my father to anyone (my half brother, my aunts, and myself). I had to go to the hospital daily to know what was going on with my father. When he was in a coma in the ICU, instead of letting the doctor give us and update on his health, she started on a rant about the fact that she was going to sue the hospital and the surgeon for malpractice. After 15 minutes, the ICU doctor just left. I couldn’t even ask any questions. It was all about her and her rage.


Fast forward to 9 months later. I was celebrating my 40th birthday and invited over 45 people to celebrate with me. I rented a reception hall, hired an event planner, a DJ and one of the best Mexican restaurant of my city to cater the event. When she walked in, she was pissed beyond measure. Karen started to yell at the event planner that she better be sitting with Joe and his family (my sister in law and my niece (20F)), or she was going to leave. When I asked her how she was, she started to tell me that ""we are not going to talk about me. That’s what you told me when Andrew was in a coma, so I’m going to tell you the same thing"". I was flabbergasted. What the fudge is she talking about. It appears that I might have told her something along those lines 9 months earlier and she was very upset that I wasn’t nice to her. Let me remind you that I have dozens of guests to welcome. 


I should have kicked her out right then and there. But I was raised to be nice to my elders, to respect my parents. Honestly, I didn’t expect to be yelled at and was like a deer in headlights. 
She had 9 months, 9 months to tell me she was upset about what I supposedly said. She could have called. She could have texted. She could have asked me to go for a coffee to clear the air. She did none of that. She waited to ruin one of the happiest moment of my life, to vomit her rage at me. 


The day after, I decided to go no contact with Karen. There are limits to what I can endure. I don’t like her, and now I decided I don’t have the energy to deal with her. 
A couple weeks later, I went for dinner with my dad, but didn’t feel like discussing this topic with him, so I haven’t told him my decision about Karen. 
Now, the holidays are coming, and Andrew invited me, Joe and his family for a Christmas dinner at Karen’s and his place. I refused. He asked what date I am available, I told him I didn’t want to see Karen for the foreseeable future. He hasn’t responded yet. 


I told Joe that I would be happy to go to out to a restaurant with him and his family later in January, but that I am not interested to see Karen. He was very understanding. Joe also had an episode in the past where she told him awful things. Because he didn’t buy her cookies with his employee discount.

I prioritize the person I am with and naturally, I'm very sensitive to people's needs and love to make others feel happy. It really is upsetting that I had to withhold all that because I realized he's not capable of being a healthy partner. We lived together for 3 years and in a relationship for 4 years. Everything really started to reveal when he moved in with me. He wasn't able to even wait for his turn to wash his hands, and to let him wash his hands first when I just had to rinse the soap off etc. 

There are a lot of emotionally dismissive scenarios or him completely refuse to acknowledge some very valid concerns. However, I'll only mention glaring red flags.

1. My first big red flag was during our first vacation. Before we went he saw researching for rental cars near the airport. He scolded at me that I am stupid for checking rental cars near the airport and I was then labeled as an ""awful planner"" and NOT allowed to plan anything even though I pay for myself. He can't drive and look at the GPS at the same time, and once, I told him to make a left turn too early, and he LOST his temper at me, including yelling out belittling statements like how can someone be so bad at directions. The next day, I injured my leg (crippled) and couldn’t keep up with him. Instead of staying with me, he left me alone for 15 hours. I had no food, no water, and was stuck at an Airbnb in the middle of nowhere with no access to delivery. He simply went off and couldn't wait to have fun by himself. He saw me sad and crying when he got back, acted like he was shocked how selfish he was and that he was very sorry. But then a year later, he told me he did feel bad here and there when he was gone, however, he chose to enjoy himself. - This, I still can't wrap my head around how he was able to ditch anyone with a crippled leg with no access to food for 15 hours.
2. I was very sick, on drowsy medication, and unable to get out of bed. He asked me to do something trivial for him—logging out of his work laptop while he was skipping work. He said is would be annoying to bring the laptop with him. When I refused because I was too ill and very drowsy, he angrily snapped, “Are you serious? You can’t even help me with this?” and tried to start an argument. He said he acknowledge he was wrong.
3. We were going to a cottage which takes 4 hours to get there. He had breakfast at home and I didn't because I had to pack. The only reason why I had to pack so last minute because he disallowed me to pack the previous night. He said I was annoying him with the packing sound. He also refused to let me wake up early because he wants to sleep in. He told me we will get breakfast for me on the way at a drive-thru and I emphasized multiple times I am good with anything including McDonald's. He missed the exit on the highway to a McDonald's. I then told him to just get out on this exit and we'll just look for anything. He literally flipped out on me and lost his temper at his best. He will not exit the highway unless he knows exactly where it is. To teach me a lesson, he refused to exit the highway to get me food, and told me he is purposely going to drive for another hour. It turned out the argument was my fault that I didn't grab something from the fridge at home, I am picky with food (even though I mentioned multiple times I'm down for anything), and how awful I am that I cannot specifically put it on the GPS. He also justified himself with an excuse that he was in a rush to get there. The weird thing was, we were on the road, his friend was hungry, and my boyfriend was more than happy to make a 20 minute detour while we were in a rush. Also, when it comes himself it is completely fine to be hungry and making a quick detour for food. He even has a problem with me if I ask him to stop by somewhere because I need to pee. - I still can't wrap my head around this
4. He had a huge fight with me because he went to buy a cup of coffee, and refused to buy one for me unless if I am also only getting a coffee. He was unwillingly to get the latte I wanted because it was $5 instead of his $2.50 coffee. He claim because he doesn't want to start a habit of him buying me lattes. I mentioned how he lives in my house that I own and charge him extremely low rent, and the reason is because I'm not measuring since he was my person. He escalated the issue by saying it was a huge sacrifice for him to live in my house, and that he should be getting equity. First, he wanted to move in with me and it wasn't my idea, and second, he saved so much money by living with me. He has a 6-figure job. He was also complaining taking me out on weekend dinner dates and paying for it. - Cheap, stingy, and measure everything making sure he's not giving more than he should is what I still believe it was
5. He does nothing around the house and doesn't cook, and he spends all his free time on his hobbies. I had talks with him to get him to do more house chores. He agreed and then would vacuum once, and it goes back to doing nothing. After multiple conversations later, he told me how he truly feel about him not doing chores. He thinks it is fair that I do all the chores because I don't have hobbies like how he does... and I don't deserve free time. His solution was we both don't need to clean and he doesn't mind his house being dirty and messy. With cooking, it is my choice to cook so it is on me and he doesn't mind eating take out every day. The weeks where I was too busy to cook, he criticized me for cooking less than usual. - This he acknowledge he was wrong and now, he cooks once a month, throws out the garbage, and puts in the dirty dishes into the dishwasher.
6. He used to can't compromise on very small things like what to order at a restaurant and what movie to watch. He would pressure me to order something I didn’t want from the menu, just so he could try an additional dish alongside the one he was ordering for himself. When he order something and it turned out he likes mine more, he would sit there watching me eat to pressure me to eat faster, so that if I can't finish it, he wants my plate. I couldn't even enjoy my dinner. - This is stopped but he does complain about paying for dinner.
7. I had a severe stomach pain from a condition that I had. Knowingly I was in pain, he was ignoring it because we were at a party (an hour drive away) and he didn't want to leave. I had to really make a scene in front of his friend (so he would look bad if he doesn't leave) to go home. When we got home, my face was pale, and he told me to carry stuff out of the car because he can't carry 2 empty paper cups. I was in severe pain! I reacted very pissed about it and it got escalated into an argument.

We did couple therapy for 1 year and his attitude towards the sessions will not work. He makes it about me not letting of the past when things actually keeps happening. It was mentioned by the therapist he ""lacks empathy"". My boyfriend makes the sessions that I need to change my behavior towards him, and he totally believes I am 90% of the problem of this relationship. I decided to stop therapy with him because he's wasting time.

He also lacks self-awareness and always acts like a Debbie Downer without noticing how it impacts me. I have my own business and I never go to him for advice because he never has anything nice to say, and he doesn't help with solutions either. ",5,1734480500.0,JustNoSO,10,1.0,False

1hgoree,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hgoree,The Problem with the mask,"I just wanna talk about the mask. Cause I‘m bored and don’t want to study for my maths exam tomorrow. 

So, my critical analysis skills, that I definitely possess, define the biggest problem of Gangle‘s new mask as the following: It‘s made of plastic. It is the Plastic Mask.
It is, as far as we know, unbreakable.
So, my dear also bored readers, I refer to slide one of my analytic presentation, where we get this information. 
In the episodes beforehand, we see Gangle with a ceramic-“esque“ type of comedy-mask, which always breaks in totally hilarious ways. And then, Gangle is always sad. Some refer to that state as the tragedy-mask, which would make sense. But I do have to say, that nowhere in the show is the face underneath the comedy-mask ever referred as the tragedy-mask. The reason I believe is quite simply, that it is neither a mask nor just a face of tragedy. The cruel joke the circus plays on Gangle is to make her depression a feature of her character design. 

But to further investigate Gangle‘s Character, we refer to slide 2 and 3. 
Gangle accuses Pomni of not respecting her authority as shift manager. Pomni doesn‘t deny it. Gangle‘s reaction to that (in slide 3) is accompanied with a sort of cracking sound, as if something ceramic got slightly broken. This happens two more times in the episode. 

In slide 4, Jax mentions, that he prefers Gangle sad, to which she reacts again deadpan with a slightly more severe cracking sound. (See slide 5)

In slide 6, same spiel with Ragatha. She says that Gangle is annoying with that happy mask. Gangle reacts again deadpan, with again an even more severe cracking sound. (See slide 7)

The mask she wears is out of plastic, and also doesn’t show cracks. She only has her face underneath, of which we can assume is made of (albeit also seemingly indestructible) a ceramic-like material, which, when cracked, would produce a sound like that. She literally cracks whenever she is hurt. Pomni‘s (non-verbal) comment hurt a little. Jax‘s, though expected, hurt more. But Ragatha‘s comment, whom Gangle thinks of very highly, hurt a lot. 

It hurt so bad actually, that her new “comedy mask“ loses it‘s function of being high-energy and positive temporarily. (See slide 8) This is the first time we see that happening in the episode. This shows the severity of Ragatha‘s comment and the true nature of the mask. That it just doesn‘t make Gangle happy automatically. It suppresses her emotions. Her Comedy-Mask were destructible by design, as she was able to express her sadness afterwards. She was able to feel hurt. Most importantly, she was able to cry. Here, she just seems empty, as further evidenced by her statement to Jax while in that state. 

Gangle herself notices that feature in slide 9. Her Comedy mask is usually broken by now. But it isn‘t. And the consequence is, that she physically had to step outside and scream out her emotions as well as finally cry out some tears, which her plastic-mask is unable to produce. There is a slight want suggested here for her comedy-mask to be broken. To be finally free and able to let all these pent up feelings out. But the stress put on her as well as her own expectations to herself tempt her, to just put on the mask again, and be miserable but “productive“.

The absolute danger of Gangle‘s need to wear that mask comes in slide 10, where she is on the brink of losing her sanity completely. The mask, which‘s purpose was to hide away Gangle‘s emotion in order to be productive and positive is now suffocating her. She can‘t take it off, as she is still at work and refuses to do so. And it just is unable to break. And so, like a ticking time bomb, it would have been a matter of time, until Gangle‘s emotions exploded in maybe abstraction. (Also, in a sweet sense of irony, the mask also paralyses her, so she is neither positive nor productive… bad :) )

Now, in slide 11 I‘m presenting the moment Gangle threw away the mask. Everything is bright, the music os epic. Now all seems well and we are supposed to feel relieved with Gangle. Her problems, which came with the mask are now gone!
Well no. The exaggerated setting is on par with Gangle‘s fantasy. We see what she feels. (And as she likes mangas, it is also quite a bit in that style) Everything is bright and beautiful. But that is just another state of mania. 
In slide 12, she looks up into a bright light of a street lamp. It is a bright light in the darkness. Something, to finally free her of that misery. In slide 13, We see her expression. She is smiling. (Another indicator that we are dealing with the actual face of Gangle, not a tragedy-mask) She has tears in her eyes, finally able to feel again. And she has her eyes closed. She seems contempt. But also, while in that motion, she already is pretty swanky as she turns around to fall onto the road. In that flurry of emotions, the relieve and the acceptance of a light in the dark, she falls onto the road. 

Now, the discussion on wether the consequence in the last slide (13) is whether this was an accident, an comedic fluke, or an actual suicide attempt. My interpretation is on suicide. There are often recorded cases of people, who right before a suicide have been reportedly very relieved. The acceptance of death can be exhilarating for a suicidal person. And with Gangle also having issues with mania, caused by masking, it doesn‘t seem far fetched that she genuinely tried to take her own life here. Her surprised look here is also quite interesting, because it kind of suggests, that outside her mania, she didn‘t plan on taking her life and seemed shocked once she realised what was happening. It suggests that the whole ordeal was a slip up in a literal and metaphorical sense. 

So, what the hell am I trying to say here? (The four cups of coffee are just setting in right now) 
I believe, that while the plastic mask can be an open allegory for a lot of things, I personally interpret it as an attempt of medical treatment of depression. In some cases, pills can cause mania and the risk of suicide to certain people. Her ceramic masks are like strategies of behavioural therapy. Gangle is still bound to her depression, once the comedy mask breaks. And it is essential for that mask to be breakable, in order to preserve her psyche, as her unbreakable plastic mask just transferred the damage inwards. 
A proper mask should alsobe repairable. So, when she is feeling hurt, her masks breaks so she is able to feel hurt. But afterwards she should be able to pick up the pieces and built herself up again. The plastic mask was fatal, as it was not breakable. 

Sorry if I‘m speaking gibberish. 
tl:dr My point is just, that the fatal flaw of the plastic mask is, that is made to be indestructible. And therefore Gangle herself cracked instead of her mask. Without being able to cry every time she got hurt.   ",8,1734480320.0,TheDigitalCircus,3,1.0,False

""Alright, that's a wrap for now!"" Ingrid called out ""Lunch time! Let's get back to the house!""

Her words echoed across the makeshift training ground, bringing an end to the pattern of gunfire, clashing swords and polearms, and energetic squeaks of the mice. Rather than a frantic scramble to leave the firing range and a stampede into the house it was a flurry of quick paws efficiently opening and checking breeches, stowing away ammo, and clicking of safety catches. Even the newcomers understood the value of firearm safety. The way they saw so much destruction from a single pull of a finger told them that double-checking was never enough.

The mice all tightened the slings around their shoulders and squeaked their affirmatives, with that, Ingrid, Sammy, Gwen, and the mice quickly jogged from the firing range, past the town of Ram Ranch, and back into the safety of Autumnhollow.

A grand lunch was awaiting everyone back at home to celebrate the arrival of the new mice. As the others were busy it was Zefir and Selphie's turn to work on the stove.

Zefir was no stranger to cooking for many; football night; old school LAN parties, chili cook-offs, potluck parties, and superbowl Sunday barbecue bashes were an almost-weekly affair back on Earth. The world of Terragalia had a preference for eating with their hands, occasionally using a knife or a fork. The Teth Valley that was half of the city's name preferred their grain quick-baked into a flatbread known as Valaam, it was simple to make with the only main difference being a scattering of chive and parsely-like green just before the batter solidifies on the pan. This gave him the idea to make Birria Tacos. In between enchanting work, he and Selphie, who had the lightest load, went back and forth between the gazebo outside and the kitchen.

But tacos alone wouldn't suffice for a welcoming feast, their new gunslingers needed more. The fresh fish caught from the lake was like salmon. These he breaded into fish fingers while Selphie worked on the dip according to his instructions, a creamy blend of homemade mayonaise with a touch of the local hot peppers.

Tacos, fish fingers, he needed something now on the plant side of the spectrum. Again, he made batter, but thinner this time, so that the wheat wouldn't overpower the zesty vegetables. As he had finished wrapping the last spring roll he looked blankly at the huge onion in front of him. Then his eyes wandered to the breaded fish fingers and a lightbulb went off in his head. Fried onion bloom.

As the mice arrived, the newcomers quickly fell in line as they watched the veteran mice clamber up the kitchen counter to quickly but throughly wash their paws. A third table had been added to the dining room which once again without anyone's intervention had expanded to accommodate them all. A third table had been laid out the night before, bought straight from a furniture store and while Gwen, Peanut, and Siria were on their way home from shopping yesterday.

As usual the mice were in a gleeful feeding frenzy, their excited squeaks filled the air as they devoured the tacos, fish fingers, spring rolls, and the crunchy golden onion bloom. Ingrid couldn’t help but smile at the sight of their tiny paws grabbing bits of food, just watching the once-sick mice now so lively healed her soul and soothed her heart. As was the sight of Peanut, the adorable little mushroom had grown on Philia, who was fussing over her like a big sister. Cuddly sat beside Peanut, patting her as well. He had been a calming effect on Peanut considering her grieving state.

\_\_\_

""How was the practice, Ingrid?"" Kvaris said as she and her sister unknowingly ate in sync.

Ingrid finshed off the last of the birria taco in her hand before answering ""The Potato mice are excellent shots, Kvaris. I'll assign Pat and Tucker to Montessa, while Alvin and Troy go to Aviz. They'll have the SVD Dragunovs. They're the best candidates for those long-range rifles.""

The four mice mentioned squeaked happily, waggling their ears cutely.

""Now the shadow mice..."" Sammy continued for her ""They've had no trouble swinging around the long blades of their greatswords,"" Sammy said, ""Their fencing still needs works but make no mistake, with the huge weight of those swords and their ability to use it easily thanks to the weight charm, fencing against them is going to very difficult, most people will just end up having their weapons knocked away or straight up sliced off.""

""We'll have their fencing skills squared away, don't worry."" Ingrid said ""That said, we're not doing any strenuous exercises yet until they're all fully recovered..."" she narrowed her eyes and looked accusingly at the newcomer mice ""...so make sure you little ones take your medicine.""

The mice looked at each other with wide eyes and nodded rapidly, their paws held up and squeaked an affirmative.

""It's for your own good guys."" Ingrid said ""I know the taste isn't good, but being sick just sucks, you know how it feels like.""

The mice nodded their heads vigorously. Being reminded of the pain and weakness they had felt served as a strong deterrent for skipping their medicine.

 

""Meanwhile, how's it going at the dismantling house, Kvaris?"" Ingrid asked.

Kvaris took a sip of coffee before speaking ""Very good, more buyers showed up to purchase the carcasses. They bought their portions at our asking price without haggling.""

Ingrid nodded in satisfaction. More gold in case the party had to take more days off.

""I also set aside some carcasses for Knarru as you requested."" Kvaris continued ""We should now be able to speed up the growth of our farm crops with Red Moon fertilizer.""

There was a collective sigh of relief from everyone as their farm could finally get a much needed boost.

""On our part."" Philia began, ""We've outsourced the production of the new mice's Traveler's Valises to a local leathersmith on Kinu's recommendation.""

""Hector Jones."" Kinu added, Ingrid quickly stifled a laugh. She immediately knew that Hector was an orc. Only an orc would have such a mundane, Earthly name in this fantasy world. ""He was an acquiantance of father during his wartime days, started out as a blacksmith's apprentice and then worked on horses. He made it big making saddles. He decided to settle in Teth-Odin so he could outfit every travelling orc tribe that soujourned here.""

""He's got a good reputation."" Kvaris agreed, ""Father claims his saddle from Hector has been around since the Battle of the Thomoon Pass a hundred and sixty years ago.""

""Right..."" Philia said, continuing her report. ""Hector said he can have those eighteen little valises completed within a week considering his busy schedule. On account of Kinu's recommendation, he shortened it to three days.""

""Afterwards,"" Siria spoke up, ""I will take the valises to a local Atelier. I know one here owned by a talented ogre...""

""A real thorough bunch."" Kinu giggled under her breath. She wasn't wrong. Ogres due to their huge size and living in a society where everyone was smaller than them had given them all an eye for the finest details. There was nothing more frightening than having an ogre storm a castle not with a sword or club as an invader, but as an accountant or Minister of Gold with a sheaf of documents, angrily demanding what these anomalous figures in the books meant.

The garm sisters had a smile as they remembered their father quaking as he opened his books to his ogre accountant, who frowned and pointed out the many losses that incurred without him even knowing about it. And those smiles turned to frowns as they remembered their ogre tutor circling so many red marks on their school papers. They were even taught to fight by ogres, who imparted to them the value of using as little energy as possible. These lessons served the sisters well as they grew into the warriors they were now.

 

""...the initial storage-enhancing enchantment will be done there,"" Siria continued ""It's quite a laborious process after all. After that, I'll bring it back and Philia can add more instances of the spell. I'd say five days.""

Ingrid leaned back on the chair. Five days doing nothing...

But she knew that wasn’t true. All the mice, both the veterans and newcomers needed to sharpen their skills. What they witnessed in the dungeons below, the fact that Peanut was a member of a group of experienced adventurers that got massacred was a sobering reminder of the harsh reality of the dangers beneath this town.

What did she call the new group that would be in Cecil's dimension? Lakota? The same Lakota that defeated General Custer?

She would be damned if her group ever got into a situation like Custer and his men. Philia, Cecil, and Zefir looked at her and she could tell they were thinking of it too. The Battle of Little Bighorn.

Ingrid shook her head and resumed her lunch.

""After lunch, Peanut, I'd like you to join me and the mice. I'll be teaching the newcomers the things we carry in our EDC, that's Everyday Carry. You'll be learning what's inside and how to use the things stored in our survival kits, first-aid kits, radios, flashlights, the works.""

""That works."" Philia said. Peanut was no slouch in the field of magic, but it was important that the little mushroom was brought up to speed with the team's modern survival gear.

""Okay!"" Peanut squeaked excitedly.

 

""Mink? Roofe? How's the business at the canned goods store?"" Ingrid asked. The two adorable dogs looked up at her and politely wiped their snouts.

""Business is picking up much faster."" Mink replied, ""we've heard some rumors from our customers that some potentially troublesome folks were eyeing our store hoping to cause trouble and extort us, but when you came over...well, let's just say seeing us as friends to a really smart and talking Nemesis-Stalker caused them to reconsider their actions.""

Ingrid couldn't help but laugh at that. ""I'm not the one they should be worried about."" she glanced at Philia, who raised her mug and an eyebrow. ""I punch people,"" Ingrid chuckled. ""Philia puts people in a wood chipper alive.""

Sammy and the garm girls chuckled darkly, noting the door to the basement was just close. A basement where more than a few guileheads met an ignoble end at the hands of the former villainess.

""Not that we're running out but we need to consider selling other products as well,"" Roofe continued for Mink ""considering that Philia at the moment is currently saddled with a lot of things to enchant, we need to consider the possibility of running of canned goods if the rate of sales pick up even faster. Now we've been talking to Cataline regarding this issue but she says she's still low on material to make any potions that are profitable. Could we have a look at the monster carcasses in the dismantling house? Maybe she can derive some ingredients from them.""

Ingrid nodded thoughtfully ""Kinu?""

""Sure."" The garm replied. ""It's not realistic to be able to sell everything anyway, we will have to turn some in for the kingdom's government so yeah.. let's have Cataline have a look.""

 

""Iohann?"" Ingrid asked.

The Felmoon priest nodded solemnly. ""The fallen adventurers are ready for their final rites. Funeral pyres will be lit tonight.""

""So about the thing I asked...?""

Sammy shrugged ""The Church of Saint Ygris lets mourners enact their own customs within reason.""

""Ingrid was asking about the 21-gun salute. It's a custom in her world in honor of those who made the ultimate sacrifice."" Iohann explained ""I've asked the Curate and he allows it, you should see orcish funerals. There's a lot of loud war cries and clashing of drums to welcome the valiant fallen into the Golden Abode.""

""Thanks."" Ingrid said ""I just wanted to show my respect for their bravery.""

Iohann nodded her head in understanding. Philia gently patted Peanut's back, the little mushroom had been quieter since the mention of the funeral.

 

In an attempt to dispel Peanut's sadness, Ingrid quickly went back to discussing what the team would do with their five days of off-time. ""Alright so, our mages will be enchanting, I got mice that need training... Kinu and Kvaris will be handling the consignment of the spoils we got... Sammy, Gwen and Cecil and I are handling the mice's training...""

""Actually about that..."" Philia added ""Please hand over the M-14's I'll be upgrading them to EBR's; Enhanced Battle Rifles.""

The mice squeaked in excitement at the mention of their new toys.

""I'm free after tomorrow."" Iohann said, sipping her tea ""I can help spar with the wolian girls and work on my staff fighting.""

""Ermmm..."" Cuddly murmured, happily munching on a spring roll.

Cecil joined Ingrid, Sammy, Neith, and the mice at the firing range. With the mice that will join the 189 decided, that left Rykard, Otto, Trent, Orlando, and Owen to enter his dimension.

""Anytime you're ready, Cecil!"" Ingrid said ""But don't push it! Just see if you can make one portal, that's all we need for now!""

Cecil, feeling confident after two slimes in the dungeon had gifted him with themselves, took a deep breath. The mana around his baby blue translucent body swirled and grew in luminescence, just like the first time Ingrid had opened up this dimension and reunited with her beloved slime familiar, a bright blue dot appeared in thin air. It then grew to the size of an apple before flattening out and expanding until it took a rectangular shape and grew until it was the size of a 50-inch flat screen TV. Colorful motes of fairydust gently drifted down an inch or two before fading.

Cecil had his back to Ingrid from his usual Dialog Window portal, and he had opened up this new portal from behind her. As a result it created an ""infinity mirror"" effect. Cecil then moved this portal away and called for the mice that would form the Lakota Team.

""Rykard! Orlando! Otto! Trent! Owen!"" He called out. The Foxy mice looked up and waddled over.

""Come in!"" he said. Tentatively the mice hopped into his dimension, into the Roof Deck that served as his dimension's ""battle stations.""

""Rykard, you're piloting this portal"" Cecil said ""You five will form Team Lakota now.""

The mice squeaked their acknowledgements.

Just like his ""seating arrangement"", Cecil had set up the Lakota team's room-side portal facing a coffee table. That way Rykard, the pilot, would sit in the middle, his back to the coffee table. The other two would sit on either side of him, while the last pair would be perched atop the table, which was the highest point they could easily reach.

A PKP Pecheneg, the same light machine gun that Cecil, Zefir, and Philia used during the Battle of New Gorpisal sat in front of Rykard's place.

""Sit here, Rykard."" Cecil said, patting a squishy tendril behind the machine gun ""This will be your gun while you pilot this portal.""

Cecil wagged a tendril at Rykard however. ""When we go into battle, I need you to hold fire until things get really serious. This is a powerful gun you see, and we need to save the bullets for when we really need them.""

The mice nodded. The slime then crawled over to a crate where a set of guns were propped up against. It was the H&K G36 pellet gun.

""In most situations. We will be using these pellet guns."" Cecil explained. ""Don't underestimate them. First of all, this carries 4000 rounds. Originally 2000, but because of Qhethar's Blessing all forms of storage that enter my dimension get doubled in size...""

Cecil continued to orient the mice regarding their weapons.

Rykard being the pilot would focus only on the Pecheneg, again, only when heavy firepower was needed. Otto and Trent, if they needed additional firepower would use M4 Specters; an Italian submachine gun with a built-in foregrip. When higher caliber bullets were needed, they would use the Belgian FN F2000's, a bullpup assault rifle known for its excellent handling even on full-auto.

The two potato mice Orlando and Owen were given the same as Otto and Trent, but Cecil gave them a special mention.

""You two given your excellent aim will be snipers."" The slime held up the big H&K G3SG/1 marksman rfile. ""This will be your primary weapon. In battle, I want you to seek the most dangerous target and take it out first. The rest of you will provide cover fire. Understood?""

The two mice nodded eagerly, their eyes glinting with excitement.

""Now fly!"" Cecil said, ""let's move this portal!"" he added happily.

The mice squeaked and squealed in a combination of fright and excitement as Rykard, the designated pilot, willed the portal to move and slowly climbed into the sky. Ingrid and Sammy watched with bated breath as the floating window to Cecil's dimension ascended. The mice's little paws gripped tightly onto whatever they could grip, themselves, each other, the edge of the table, but the floor they were on was rock steady. There was no interia felt in Cecil's room. emboldened, Rykard began to soar through the skies of Autumnhollow, the mice squealing in delight.

**Church of Saint Ygris:**

That evening, Iohann and a few priests of the Church made the final prayers for the fallen adventurers. The ceremony was held behind the church, in a big colonnaded courtyard held for such solemn rites. In the middle of the courtyard, a grand pyre had been built from seasoned logs and fragrant herbs. It was a traditional way of sending off those who had passed in this world to the next, especially for warriors who had fought valiantly.

Peanut was quietly sniffling as she laid flowers on her fallen friends, the little mushroom's eyes quickly filling with tears while Siria cradled her in her arms, a hand stroking her velvety cap for comfort.

Ingrid and Philia attended in military regalia. Despite the sorrow in the air, Zefir had to put some effort wiping a smile in the knowledge that the two were cosplaying characters from a Shojo Kantai; a well-known gacha game featuring ""ship girls"" i.e. anthropomorphized real world warships in the form of cute girls. But it was still military and official-looking enough and the medals, especially the purple heart were no joke. It was a somber reminder that Ingrid and Philia made the ultimate sacrifice back on Earth.

The woolly gnu priest that Zefir saw yesterday was once again making his deep, guttural throat song as made his final prayers for the dead. There was a moment of silence before he gestured it was now time for the others to enact their own funeral customs. The orcs raised a loud war cry, congratulating the spirits of the valiant dead, attesting to the Gods that they were worthy of exalted places in the Golden Abode. Garms and kobolds howled loud and deep at the rising moon, the wolves from the surrounding forest joining in.

There was a pause for Ingrid, Philia, Zefir, and Cecil's turn.

Ingrid and Philia sharply turned and barked out their commands. The mice marched in step, their guns held to their chest. They formed a line and aimed their guns high.

Another command and the mice let out one after the other a 21-gun salute, making a loud squeak as they did.

It was now Zefir's turn. He was part of the scouts back in Sarasota and he picked up his borrowed trumpet and played a mournful Taps. Even though they were in another world everyone could tell this was a mourning call; a lone trumpet, the painful poignant pauses between notes cutting through the air like a knife.

As the congregation broke up and mingled with each other, Ingrid quickly glanced at the mice, some of them quickly moving along with Cecil to pick up the spent pellet shells.

Among the mourners were acquaintances of the Grand Haloes, as Peanut was a rather recent addition, she didn't know much of them. Siria kept the little mushroom cuddled to her chest, whether it was to soothe the grieving Peanut or to shield her from any reproach by using her reputation as the Legendary Solo Adventurer, nobody knew. Ingrid must have sensed this as well as she also kept close to Peanut as they mingled with the others. Seeing Siria next to such an intimidating Nemesis-Stalker would surely halt any unpleasant interactions.

Philia on the other hand kept close to the mice. They hovered closed to one pyre, where their own was being carried away by the flames. The mice took out their rations and tossed them into the flames. Cuddly, in a moment of solidarity, chucked his carrot as well.

The mice saluted by the fire. Philia considered approaching the mice to pat them but stayed her hand, and simply stood by, telling curious on-lookers with her eyes to leave them alone.

Gwen shyly approached Philia and they embraced. She understood now what she did back in the border of Veles and Elion-Nosco, when she had emptied magazine after magazine into the air after killing her own maids. As cold as her reasoning was that they would not keep their mouths shut, she genuinely grieved for the girls who had raised her.

\_\_\_

Dinner back home at Autumnhollow restored everyone's spirits. The mice gathered around the grill in a circle, swaying back and forth in unison as they squeaked their mouse songs. Ingrid let the mice handle the barbecue tonight; something to help keep their minds off the grim events. Putting Peanut and Cuddly to work preparing the vegetables was like putting a seal to work in a sushi joint as they kept eating half of their prep work, the root crops were a lost cause thanks to the hare's appetite.

Meanwhile Cecil and Zefir were working on pasta. The Muse Box in Cecil's room was predictably blasting ""La Donna E Mobile"" as they sang along and made the meat sauce. They originaly thought of adding meatballs but as the mice were already making the barbecue and two big salmon-like lake fish were currently testing out the new smoke house, the ciltran and slime decided to skip the meatballs for tonight.

""That's quite a song!"" Kvaris said, giggling with amusement as they and Kinu chopped up the veal they would use for the ground meat.

""Correction."" Zefir said ""It's opera... it's a kind of play where all lines are sung, not spoken, so it's not just an 'opera song' it's an entire scene!""

Cecil chuckled ""Yeah, well, in most movies whenever La Donne E Mobile is playing, someone is always getting beaten up in the background. You know what... let's finally get some videos rolling later...""

Sammy and Gwen returned from the market, having bought enough ale to keep the party going all night as well as wheels of zesty cheese. Kinu returned from the Arcane Pasture, having given Cataline the various flowers they had taken as gifts. The Maiyea witch beamed with pleasure as she recognized some of these flowers were quite valuable ingredients for her potions.

They had their dinner not inside the house but in the front patio of the house, with Ingrid radioing Farlan to call in all the villagers. Everyone had made too much, she said and it was long past due that everyone had a good feast together.

 

""I would be remiss as a landlord to have put this off for so long..."" Ingrid said as she raised her glass ""but it's about time that we all here in Autumnhollow had a proper feast. I know it's late, but once again, welcome to Autumnhollow, welcome to Ram Ranch...""

The Whales suppressed their giggles as they remembered that ""song"" that got everyone laughing last time.

Ingrid continued ""We're also holding this feast for three other occasions. One is to welcome Selphie and Kirtus to our home. I would like all of you to know that Selphie has proven such an invaluable help to our team during times of battle. Her floramancy has time and time again held back the onslaught of enemies that would have overwhelmed us. And Kirtus, your courage in the face of danger allowed us time to step in and rescue these fine folks from the Guileheads...""

Ingrid paused to let the villagers and the Whales applaud the minotaur for his selfless bravery.

""Another reason for this feast is to welcome Peanut Mallowcap, a survivor of the Grand Halos. Tonight they have been welcomed to the Golden Abode with all the due honors.""

The little mushroom floated up and bowed as everyone applauded her.

""Last but not least, to our brave new mice, who have never given up hope. We have rescued them from the clutches of the Dead Eaters that have infested the dungeon. They will be joining our party and with their help, we will once again make the dungeons of Teth-Odin set to the odds of us adventurers, and not the monsters.""

The new mice, Umbra, Foxtrox, and Potato stood up on their seats and squeaked cutely as they took their applause.

""Oh and let's not forget... we're making a killing on the market!"" Ingrid said ""To Mink and Roofe's canned goods store, and Nod's talent in fishing you three are heroes to our humble village of Ram Ranch."" The two dogs and garm-folk shly stood and took a bow as everyone clapped.

""And also, let's not forget the services of Cataline, your potions have made the raid on Irons a success, thanks to you, casualties have been brought to an absolute...minimum!""

The Maiyea witch stumbled a bit as she tried to stand and take a bow, her cheeks flushing red with the unexpected praise. Some of the Whales, including Philia, Kvaris, and Cecil glanced at Ingrid, there was a flicker of regret in her eyes telling them that she still was troubled with the Sarin attack she had ordered on the town, but she kept herself under control.

\_\_\_

Rather than a traditional, stuffy dinner setting with set seating arrangements, and due to her desire to have people mingle, Ingrid had instructed her team to set up tonight's dinner as more of a potluck style gathering. The dishes were all placed on a central table but the seating was scattered across the patio. People shifted about and chatted with one another as they swapped stories. One by one the villagers came over to thank Ingrid for her generosity.

""Well, it's not really a generosity... it's a give-and-take"" Ingrid reminded them.

""So how's the boat going, Nod?"" Ingrid asked.

""We just finished caulking the seams,"" Nod answered, ""I just need it to dry and soon I can start rowing out to the deeper waters.""

""Good, good,"" Ingrid beamed. ""The fish in that lake are so tasty... it's no wonder they're selling so well in the market.""

She patted his shoulder. Part of her still had her suspicions about him but in the end, he was a hunted man by the Guileheads and had nowhere else to go.

 

""I'll stay..."" Kirtus said as he walked up to Ingrid ""There's no such thing as too many farmhands, and Selphie mentioned Red Moon fertilizer, it'll go to waste if it's not used in time...""

Ingrid smiled ""you're like a father-figure to Selphie, she'd miss you if you left, you know?""

Kirtus made a gruff bovine rumble ""Erm, I know, I know... I just don't want to impose.""

 

Sammy was regaling the group with tales of the team's battles ""You should have seen how strong Ingrid was.. one swing of her fist and POW!"" she made an uppercut gesture, causing the villagers to gasp ""Over fifty Dead Eaters were sent flying into the air like ragdolls!""

The mice, Cuddly, and Peanut were being showered with affection by everyone, their eyes closed as they were patted by various hands. Even Iohann's Nyx Fish Yogzolom floated about, gently darting at the table to sample terrestial dishes one couldn't find deep under the sea.

\_\_\_

It was well past noon when everyone had gotten up, Nod was hurrying tight-lipped to his stall, he and some villagers hauled yesterday's smoked catch onto the wagon as Gwen hitched the Aurochs for their daily journey to the market. Mink and Roof opened up shop with a slight hangover, wagging their tails and chuckling amongst themselves at the memory of Ingrid drunkenly singing loudly of a ""Photograph"" which they later learned was a portrait painted not with a brush but with light. Her singing sounded quite out of tune, but it seemed that her otherworlder companions were more amused at her choice of song rather than her singing prowess. Still, it spoke of nostalgia and joy, a good omen for the day ahead.

 

*""I miss that town, I miss the faces*  
*You can't erase, you can't replace it*  
*I miss it now, I can't believe it*  
*So hard to stay, too hard to leave it...""*

The song in question was playing in the Control Room. Ingrid was idly spinning her glass on the table. A cold jug of ale rested on the table, condensation rolling down and onto the table's surface. Philia downed her drink and signaled for Neith to begin. She sat opposite Ingrid on the table while Cecil floated between them.

""Are you sure about this?"" Arek said.

Ingrid looked out the window, at Peanut playing with mice. The memories of Peanut breaking down in the dungeon when she pulled back the sheets and confirmed that those who lay on the stone cold floor were indeed her friends were still fresh in her mind.

""Yes...""

Arek sighed and left the room.

There were sounds of footsteps, human feet this time, as someone climbed down the stairs into Arek's basement.

Philia, Ingrid, and Cecil uncomfortably couldn't meet the gaze of Cindy before them.

 

“Before you say anything, Cindy.” Philia said “We ARE dead. On Earth that is. I had to start from day one as an infant, Ingrid and Cecil came in barely a week ago.”

""I can't explain how we're here. But we're not returning even if there's a way."" Ingrid said. ""We're needed here. That’s what Starchasers do, that’s what heroes do.""

""I see...but why tell me this?"" Cindy asked.

“Because little Cecil was parroting everything I was saying.” Cecil said regretfully.

Cindy sobbed a little, but there was relief in her voice.

“I’m j-just glad you three are okay.”

“We’re dead!” The three chorused.

“Y-yeah, on Earth… So you three have been Isekai’d or something… but, why did you have to tell me? I mean it’s good to know you’ve found a way to breach dimensions but…”

“Cindy! Me and all the Starchaser familiars have been pulled out from another dimension.” Cecil reminded her. “It shouldn’t be a leap in logic.”

“Okay, so why?”

""Just a few days ago a friend of ours lost someone important to them. We've kinda forgotten what it's like to see and hear someone grieving. It must have been painful for you folks, but the reality is, we're dead. Philia, Cecil, and I are dead. This would have never happened if I was such a loner back on Earth. It cost us Philia, it cost us Cecil, and it cost us me. There's no sense trying to bring us back. Move on… also as thanks for giving the little Cecil to Arek for safekeeping.""

""About that…"" Cindy hiccuped a little, ""some of the Starchasers are starting to think whatever he said might have been connected to the real one...""

""Ignore it."" Philia said ""You know how this works, denying only makes it worse. And, whatever you do, you cannot let Taffy know about this.""

There was a pause as Cindy sniffled and wiped a tear from her eye.

""Athena's been going back and forth to Taffy's place...""

""Wrench her out of it."" Ingrid said firmly. ""Focus on Melrondia's successor.""

Philia groaned, slumping back in her chair ""I knew I shouldn't have thrown that annoying brat off of a cliff...""

""Alright..."" Cindy said.

""Sorry for whatever I said Cindy."" The slime said but Cindy sniffed and wiped another tear.

""No, I don't have a right to protest about that. You've stepped up where all other familiars were too afraid to-WHAT IS THAT!?""

Some of the tixi mice waddled into the room and curiously chittered up to Ingrid, Philia, and Cecil, Ingrid and Philia picked up a mouse and laid them on their laps, cuddling them to their chests while Cecil's mouse patted him down like a mochi ball.

""Why we can't leave."" Cecil said, his voice melting as a second mouse climbed in and pattycaked him.

""If anyone dares take us out of this world or mess with it, I WILL tell Taffy to burn Earth to the ground."" Philia said as she cuddled her mouse.

""I WANNA PAT THEM!"" Cindy cried, tears of envy in her eyes as she pressed herself to the screen.

From HIM, Clutch and Viking Skull to Whitechapel, No Cure, Spite and Full of Hell. I also play guitar so having a wide range of music helps with writing.If you're interested in the same genre of music as myself, that's a massive plus for me and I'll probably talk your ear off about it


Video games also take up a lot of my time. A good session on CS2 or Destiny with the boys is a great way to spend my nights. Talking shit, making jokes and laughing until I'm crying. I spend a lot of time on discord so maybe we could talk there? Play some games or watch some shows together


I'm pretty introverted but I do enjoy getting out ano having coffee or beers with my friends as often as I can just to keep myself occupied. 

I’m terrible at keeping conversations going so I hope you’re able to deal with my nonsense lmao. I look forward to getting to know you! 


Again, my apologies if this was all over the place or very inconsistent. I'm quiet and nerdy and don't like writing about myself. If anything l've said peaks your interest, feel free to send me a chat. I'll answer as often as I can.

A few months ago I wrote a limited-location horror feature with the goal to make it independently with my partner. Though the script itself didn't score amazingly high on feedback sites (6s and 7s on Blacklist, 73 on Slated) it was shared and read by some of my favorite production studios in the space with some nice praise here and there, and the feedback/development process has sort of blown the budget away from something I can self finance.

As a result, I've been doing some rewrites with the goal to option it instead. One of the biggest notes I got involves the first act, where the prologue made it confusing who the protagonist was meant to be. I've reworked the opening by cutting the prologue in half, but do you feel it's still too confusing? On top of this, do you have any other thoughts on the first 10 pages? Would you feel more engaged if it started on page 5, even if it loses the sleep paralysis intro?

Thanks so much!

- **Limited Color Range:** The whitening effect may vary depending on the initial color of your teeth, so results can differ from person to person.

### Comparing Other Teeth Whitening Options

To gauge the effectiveness of Power Swabs, it is important to understand how they stack up against other popular teeth whitening options.

#### 2. Over-the-Counter Whitening Strips

- **Pros:** Whitening strips are relatively affordable and easy to use, offering some flexibility in treatment schedule.
- **Cons:** Results can take longer to become visible, and users may experience sensitivity issues similar to traditional methods.

#### 3. DIY Home Remedies

He also claimed when we first met that he doesn’t do social media. He has them but hasn’t logged in for years. 

Then I stumbled upon his public social media, where he would like 20+ girls photos a day or more, while simultaneously telling me what a fuckhead my friends fiancé was for doing the same thing. 

So I called him out on it. His first response was - no I don’t. Then it was, I love you enough to stop doing it. 

And he stopped, for awhile. Then he’d go on a bender and do it again. 

So I called him out again. And he deleted his SM account. But then joined another one, publically, and responded to women’s posts suggesting getting coffee anytime.

So at that point I lost it. I told him I could see it all, and I didn’t want to log on to social media and see that shit. 

So he deleted his SM again. And then argued - I guess I don’t understand social media. We follow people to interact and like their content. That’s what I do, is that not what social media is for? 

Am I trippin?! Like..AITA for thinking his a hypocrite for one, and because I ask that he maybe not like 100s of girls pictures online?

I’m concerned the stand and table I am considering are all too similar and recognize there should be variety in my furniture. In addition, the TV stand would be long enough to extend into the space between the couch and wall (represented by the measuring tape, not the painter’s tape outline), and while I don’t need to use that space to walk through, I’m concerned it may not look good or is not good feng shui.

I’m someone who likes to plan my time carefully, so I started early and made sure my portion was finished a day before the deadline.

That morning, while chatting near the coffee machine, Mark made an offhand comment in front of a few coworkers: “Must be nice having enough time to stroll around the office. I’m drowning over here while some people are on cruise control.” I brushed it off at the time, but honestly, I found it irritating. I don’t stroll—I just manage my workload well.

Fast forward to 5pm that day. I’m packing up to leave when Mark comes to my desk looking stressed and says, “Hey mate, I’m not going to finish my part on time. Can you stay late and help me out?”

I calmly told him I couldn’t—I’d already done my share of the work, and I had plans that evening. He got frustrated and muttered, “Typical.” I didn’t argue, I just left.

The next day, Mark missed the deadline, and our manager wasn’t happy. Now a few people are saying I could’ve been more of a team player and helped him out.

I (27f) have a boyfriend my same age. Recently we got into a fight because I said he is too nice to people beyond reason. As in, listening to them vent about husbands, ordering them lunch/coffee, and the event that set me off: walking a girl to her car because she told him she gets lost easily (they use a parking garage connected to their office, she has worked there several months already). 
My ask was just for him to back off a little, I have no problem with him having a female friend, but I just don’t see why it has to be so extravagant. 
We haven’t been on a date in 10 months, I don’t get any gifts or compliments regularly, which I consider myself fairly low maintenance and isn’t the issue for me either. My take was that the pedestal for me and other women is the same. I expect my partner to treat me a smidge better and take my side on things, not pedal after women he works with just because they ask it of him. 

His response was that I am asking him to change as a person by my requests and that he wasn’t willing to change at all. AITAH, for wanting to be his number one?

-------------------------------------------------------

In uncertain times, being financially prepared can make all the difference. Knowing what steps to take can ensure that you and your family can weather any storm. Let’s explore essential financial preparations that can help you survive a crisis.

### Build an Emergency Fund

An emergency fund is your safety net during difficult times. Aim to save enough to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. This fund should be easily accessible, so consider keeping it in a high-yield savings account. Start small if necessary; even saving a little each month adds up over time.

### Review and Adjust Your Budget

Without a clear budget, it’s hard to track your financial progress. During a crisis, updating your budget is crucial. Take the time to:

- Identify essential and non-essential expenses.
- Reduce discretionary spending.
- Redirect those funds towards your emergency fund.

This proactive approach will give you a clearer idea of your financial position and help you prioritize essential spending.

### Reduce Debt

High levels of debt can be overwhelming, especially during a crisis. Focus on reducing high-interest credit card debt first. You can do this by:

- Making extra payments when you can.
- Consolidating debts to lower your interest rates.
- Using a debt snowball method, where you pay off the smallest debts first.

By lowering your debt load, you'll free up cash for savings and necessary expenses.

### Assess Insurance Coverage

Insurance can protect your assets and provide peace of mind during crises. Review your current policies, including health, auto, home, and life insurance. Ensure you have adequate coverage for potential risks, such as:

- Health-related expenses
- Natural disasters
- Loss of income due to job loss

Don't hesitate to shop around for better rates or more comprehensive coverage if necessary.

### Diversify Your Income Sources

Relying on a single income source can be risky. Consider creating additional income streams to bolster your financial stability. Some ideas include:

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/what-are-the-most-important-financial-preparations-for-a-crisis/  
  
- Freelancing or consulting in your area of expertise.
- Starting a side business.
- Investing in passive income opportunities, like real estate or dividend-paying stocks.

Diversifying your income can provide a cushion when your primary job is affected.

### Stay Informed About Financial Resources

During a crisis, many financial resources become available. Governments and local organizations often provide assistance programs. Stay informed about options that may help you, such as:

- Unemployment benefits
- Food assistance programs
- Debt relief options

Building an Emergency Fund: Steps and Strategies for Financial Resilience
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building an emergency fund is one of the most important steps you can take for your financial health. It acts as a financial safety net that can shield you from unexpected expenses, like medical bills or job losses. This fund ensures that you are prepared for life's unforeseen events and helps you avoid dipping into debt.

### Understanding the Importance of an Emergency Fund

An emergency fund is designed to be used only in case of emergencies. This could range from a car repair to losing your job. Having a dedicated fund means you won’t have to rely on credit cards or loans, which often come with high-interest rates. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Peace of Mind:** Knowing you have money set aside can reduce stress during difficult times.
- **Financial Stability:** It helps you maintain your financial independence and stability in unpredictable situations.
- **Avoiding Debt:** An emergency fund allows you to cover unexpected costs without falling into debt.

### Steps to Build Your Emergency Fund

Creating an emergency fund may seem daunting, but breaking the process down into manageable steps can make it easier. Here is a simple plan for how to start:

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/what-are-the-most-important-financial-preparations-for-a-crisis/  
  
#### 1. Set a Target Amount

Decide how much money you want to have in your emergency fund. A common recommendation is to save three to six months’ worth of living expenses. Start by calculating your monthly expenses, including rent, groceries, utilities, and any other regular bills. This will give you a specific target to aim for.

#### 2. Open a Separate Account

To keep your emergency fund distinct from your everyday spending, open a separate savings account. Look for one with a competitive interest rate and no fees. This will help you grow your savings while keeping it separate from your regular finances, making it less tempting to dip into.

#### 3. Automate Your Savings

One of the best ways to steadily build your fund is through automation. Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your emergency fund each month. Treat this transfer like a regular bill you need to pay. Start small if necessary, and increase the amount as you can.

#### 4. Cut Unnecessary Expenses

Review your budget for areas where you can cut back. Consider the following:

- Coffee shop visits
- Dining out
- Subscription services
- Impulse purchases

Redirect these funds to your emergency savings, even if it’s just a small amount each month. Every little bit helps.

#### 5. Use Windfalls Wisely

If you receive a tax refund, bonus, or gift, consider putting that money directly into your emergency fund. These “windfalls” can significantly accelerate your savings. Instead of spending it, think of it as a great opportunity to bolster your financial safety net.

### Maintaining Your Emergency Fund

Once you've built your emergency fund, it’s crucial to maintain it. Here are some tips on how to keep it intact:

#### 1. Regularly Review Your Savings

Check your fund periodically to ensure it aligns with your current living expenses. Life changes can impact how much you may need, so keep your savings updated. Adjust the target amount if necessary.

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/what-are-the-most-important-financial-preparations-for-a-crisis/  
  
#### 2. Resist Temptation

Remember, your emergency fund is for emergencies only. If you withdraw funds for non-emergencies, it can defeat the purpose. Stay disciplined and practice patience.

#### 3. Replenish After Use

If you ever need to tap into your emergency fund, aim to replenish it as soon as possible. Set a plan on how you will rebuild that amount, whether it is through additional savings or budgeting adjustments.


Building an emergency fund is a crucial step in securing your financial future. It provides you with peace of mind and protects you in difficult circumstances. By following these steps and strategies, you can create a robust financial cushion that will help you weather life's storms.

### Conclusion

Preparing financially for a crisis is essential for your peace of mind and security. A well-structured plan can transform a potential disaster into a manageable situation. By focusing on the essential financial preparations discussed, you can build a solid foundation that will support you during challenging times.

Establishing an emergency fund should be at the top of your list. It acts as a financial cushion, allowing you to cover unexpected expenses without falling into debt. Begin by saving enough to cover at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses. This might seem daunting, but breaking it down into smaller, achievable goals can make it more manageable. Consider setting up an automatic transfer to your savings account every month to build this fund gradually.

Furthermore, reassessing your monthly budget is crucial. Identifying non-essential expenditures can free up cash that can be redirected toward your emergency savings. Seek ways to increase your income through side jobs or freelance work if possible. Every little bit helps in strengthening your financial position.

Remember, the key to survival in times of crisis lies in preparation. By putting these steps into action, you enhance your financial resilience and provide yourself with the tools needed to navigate turbulent waters.

Ultimately, financial readiness empowers you to confront uncertainty with confidence, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—your well-being and that of your loved ones. Equip yourself with these strategies today, and you'll be well-prepared for whatever tomorrow may bring.",1,1734477823.0,GridDownGuide,0,1.0,False

1hgnszw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1hgnszw/am_i_a_terrible_person_for_taking_money_from_my/,Am I a terrible person for taking money from my estranged parents?,"The story goes following: growing up with my parents was sheer horror - there was physical abuse, and mental abuse. Both my parents were incapable of raising children and both were - in their own separate ways - fairly broken.

When I was 17 I had a mental breakdown. I wanted to be sectioned because I legitimately did not want to have anything to do with the outside world anymore, and especially wanted to be away from „home“. I asked my parents in tears to do this for me. 

While they did not want to put me into the psych ward, I have to give them credit - for once they were actually concerned. So they allowed me to move in with my grandma and see a psychologist. That was probably the best time of my life.

And for a while I thought it was gonna be alright- as a matter of fact, I was willing to sort things out with my parents and perhaps have a better relationship, and it seemed they were up for it too - I had such hope for our family - especially my relationship with my mother, who I was quite close to when I was a child (despite a lot of gaslighting and insults on her part).

But unfortunately things went sour again, just one year later. The gaslighting started again - a few times, when I tried to talk to her about something she said that I felt hurt about, she accused me of lying  or imagining things. I wasn’t trying to be accusatory, I just wanted to work to a better relationship with them…

There was also my brother, who always disliked me because my father abused him much more than he did me (so he felt that I was taking away the love of our dad from him - he felt that I was spared and coddled while he went through hell). After I went to therapy and tried doing things that made me happy (such as saying „no“ to things I didn’t want to do, or not giving away my money or possessions), he started calling me a n*rcissist and an egomaniac. He called me crazy because I was going to therapy. 

One time we were in the car - my brother, mother and I - and my brother went on another one of his tirades against me - calling me everything in the book. I tried to defend myself, but he just went on and on. I looked at my mother and asked „Are you gonna say anything about this?“ and she said no, she wasn’t gonna get into this. I asked her later on why she was just sitting there. I asked her „Do you agree with the things he‘s saying about me?“ and she just shrugged. That was that - the guy called me a crazy n*rcissist and my own mother wasn’t gonna disagree with him.

That’s when our relationship broke to pieces. Luckily, I went to university not much later - and I realised I could finally breathe. Over Christmas I came back to my family and it was one of the worst experiences of my life - all the terror and weight of the past years came flooding in. I decided then and there that I wanted nothing to do with my family anymore - not even contact.

Bad thing was - they were still paying for my university and accommodation. I was fully dependent on them. Covid also hit right then so it was all just a mess. I never felt so lonely. During that time, cutting off my family while still taking their money felt awful - I felt like a hypocrite, and I felt like my independence was infringed upon. But I couldn’t help it - I had no idea where to start; I was still doing my degree and during quarantine I didn’t even know if there was anything I could’ve done for money. 

Things went back to normal closer to when I was graduating, so I started looking for jobs - a little later than I should, I have to admit. Honestly, I just hadn’t thought it was gonna be so difficult. But I wanted to be independent.

During the months leading to my graduation, I became acquainted with the absolute state of the current job market. I applied to hundreds of jobs and absolutely nothing worked out - I didn’t even get an interview. By the end I was applying to coffee shops and restaurants and even they never got back to me. 

Finally, I had to move out of my university accommodation, and I realised I had nothing lined up - not even a flat to move into. No landlord would take me without a job - they only offered me to move in if I could pay an entire year‘s rent at once (with money I didn’t have, of course). 

So in a last ditch effort I put all my stuff in a storage unit and went into a hostel- multiple hostels actually. I was applying like mad for jobs but NOTHING. It was all for naught. I was running out of money and had nowhere to go - there were two friends I knew well enough to crash at, but both were travelling at the time, so that wasn’t an option. 

By the end, I was quite literally a day away from homelessness. I sent out an application to the army, but they only drafted people again a few months down the line. So I was literally out of options. 

Then I get an email from my university saying that they have accepted me for a masters program and even have accommodation for me (for which I obviously would have to pay). So, I called my mom and asked if they could pay for that year of the masters and she agreed.

So another year went by of me taking their money. I don’t think I ever felt this disgusted with myself. Things got rough, and I immediately went to mommy and daddy - the people who abused me all my life. And I took their money smiling. I feel like a terrible person…",10,1734477563.0,EstrangedAdultChild,5,1.0,False

1hgnpxg,https://i.redd.it/epnk88slrh7e1.png,Dear Doordash: Thank you for getting me out of an awkward situation last night 😂,"This post is a bit random but I figured I would share it cuz idk this sub could use something different every now and then 😂.

A customer asked me for my number a couple weeks back and I obliged. We'd been chatting during that time via text which was going kind of meh. But I figured I would give him a chance IRL so we went out on a lunch date for the first time yesterday.

Overall the date went pretty well. He -seems- like a very nice and respectful guy but I still have my guard up about nice guys because I'm coming out of a very bad relationship with a guy who pretended to be nice in the beginning and turned out to be Satan's spawn basically.

Not to mention there were a few red flags during the date. I asked him what his intentions were at the end of the first half of the date and he said he was wanting to be friends at first and just seeing where it would go. I liked that because I'm fresh out of a very long-term/bad relationship so I want to take it nice and slow anyway. But then he asked me if I wanted to go get some coffee and I made the mistake of agreeing to let him drive. He ended up doing a
 complete 180 in the car and put his hand on my leg, started holding my hand and then tried to kiss me all of a sudden 🙃. Like I'm sorry bro, how many friends do you go around kissing??? I was kind of okay with the hold handing, though it was a bit awkward at first, but definitely drew the line at kissing. Especially after we both agreed that we wanted to try the friend route first and see where things went. He apologized and we essentially moved on.

Second half of the date also went great, good conversation, lots of laughs etc. It's starting to get late/time for me to go to work.

So we head back to his car and then he just kind of lingers awkwardly not starting the car, not driving back to my car and starts telling me how he's had such a great time and wants to do this again. Which is all fine and dandy, and I told him I wouldn't mind seeing him again as well, but then he keeps saying it over and over again. To the point of it getting awkward.

Then Doordash send me a notification that it's almost time for my dash to start. So I kind of reiterate ""oh yah we should probably head back now"". He also starts telling me how he gets emotionally attached easily and I'm doing my best to be chill even though I'm getting uncomfortable. Like literally earlier he said he just wants to be friends for now and then we end up having a really good time and all of a sudden he's admitting how he gets emotionally attached easily 😅😅😅. Queue Doordash, sends me another text, and another to remind me it's time to dash. And what's odd is that they never do this. Usually I only get one text notification about 15 minutes prior to my dash ending and then nothing. But last night it was like they knew that I needed an out 😂. So he finally got the memo and started driving us back to my car.

All of this being said I did agree to another date with him, not entirely sure if I should have but I genuinely did have a good time outside of the really awkward moments. But I know for future reference to just drive my own car next time 🤣.

That's it. Just my awkward story of the day and the one time I can actually say thank you Doordash for saving me 🙏💀😂.",6,1734477328.0,DoorDashDrivers,22,0.75,False

They said I required more assistance than the ""standart autistic"" (not exactly their words, but English isn't my first language so I'm trying my best to translate it in a way that makes sense) and thus I had to quit my job because my boss wasn't willing to make the accommodations I needed, which is fine, no one has to change for me.

The problem is, no other place wanted to deal with a disabled person in my city so I have nowhere to work, even remotely most places don't want it and each time I ask why they refused my application they always say ""we can't accomodate for you here/we need someone with better social skills/we don't know how to work with disabled people"". For context, I'm blunt, facial expressions are hard for me, I need to have noise cancelling headphones in noisy spaces and I also need very clear instructions about my job.

There's not even ""accommodations"" to be made about these points so I have no idea what they all mean by it, I even have my own noise cancelling headphones. The government of my country gives disabled people a minimum salary per month, but they take months, even years, to check everything and start the process to make you positive to receive. I quit my job right after my diagnosis, so it's been about 3 months sonce I stopped working and I can't take it anymore. I was a barista, making coffee and other drinks was relaxing and I could also experiment mixing some drinks and learn how to interact properly whenever our regulars came by. It was so fun, salary wasn't great but what counted for me was the experience.

Even when I start to receive the government salary, my lawyer has expressed all that will go to my mom's bank account just because my diagnosis was higher than most autistic people (or because apparently I need too much support, even though I've been living fine without it). I tried to fight against it but none of them seem to take my words into consideration, it's like they see me as a kid unable to make my own decisions. It's so frustrating, I'm so tired of all of this.

I have known her longer than i know my fianceé, the problem is, she didnt want me to hang out with her, and would get upset with me if i did, but she could hang out with her normally.  
  
So i have made the dumbest decision i have ever made. I did not tell her that i was with her, because i didnt want to make her upset, and if she asked me if i was with her, i LIED. I am such a fucking asshole.   
I was thinking i was doing the right thing. But i was not.   
  
I have to note that Petra(F) is really just a friend, no bad intentions or anything, i know her since she was little, because i know her brother very well.  Just a friends hangout, coffee, ciggie, chat and that was it.

  
 She told she doesnt trust me anymore and never will. That she is unhappy in our relationship for 5 years, and doesnt want to suffer anymore, and when she looks at herself in the mirror, she doesnt recognize herself, because she was very happy a smily, but now, she is suffering. She left me for 5 days last week and something in me changed, I realised what the woman is to me, my everything. Without her, there is no me.   
  
 I was planning to go to a therapy, also about my anger issues (i have never ever hit her, i just yell). I was ready for a change, because i didnt want to lose her, but she doesnt want to give me any more chances, because i let her down so many times, but those 5 days, hit me like a train, i am 100% commited to change, 

She also took off her engagement ring, and is being dismissing.

Does she need time and maybe time will tell? How do i gain atleast a bit of trust again ?  
  
I am willing to fight for her, whatever it takes. I love her to death.

The short, squid-like locals surrounded the diverse group not quite driving them onwards but not letting them go back, bead and shell necklaces clicking and rattling with each jab of a spear.

Josh smiled, dragged his fingers through his unkempt hair as he stood up, the remains of his survival suit reflecting the flickering flames. Grabbing his own spear, he stepped into the smoky light of the central fire.

“Josh?”

“Lieutenant Va’nu… captain now, I see.”

Va’nu had the decency to turn pale as Josh leaned closer.

“We… uhm... we thought you were dead, Josh.”

“I know, Va’nu. I should rightfully be dead.”

“It is good to… uhm… good to... uhm… are you angry, Josh?”

Josh tilted his head back and laughed. 

“Angry? Me? Angry at you?”

Josh grinned as he shifted his grip on the spear, slowly pacing around the group of his former shipmates.

Va’nu started to say something, but a jab from a spear quieted him just as Josh started talking again.

“Why would I be angry, just because you decided to blast off when I was less than five hundred meters from the ship?”

The group of Josh’s former shipmates pulled closer together as Josh turned to one of the short natives, their multitude of ocular receptors focused on the Terran 

“*Neeley? Drinks for my long lost friends, chop-chop!*”

“Where was I... ah yes, angry. No, why would I be angry at you for leaving me on a class seven Death World? Only a fool would carry a grudge just because you left when I was in clear sight of the ship.. and with all of Neeley's tribe on my heels.”

A dozen tentacles thrust wooden cups of oily, amber liquid toward the outsiders. The outsiders stared at them as if they were antimatter grenades..

“The drinks are safe. Don't look at them like they are poison - it's just the local brew. Take it!”

Unsteady hands, tendrils, and pseudopods carefully grasped the wooden vessels - holding them as if they could catch fire at any moment. The oily liquid in them moved oddly, as if half alive.

“Why would I be angry at you for saving your own skin and condemning me to what must have seemed to you as a certain, cruel, and unusual death - or worse?”

Josh chuckled as he looked around, at the large number of natives clustering close around the outsiders.

“But I managed... I managed. Not just to survive, but to make my own little place here. Neeley's people are not all that bad, all things considered, once you get to know them and they got to know you. They are a little rude, they can be a little crude, and they practice a lot of ritualised sadism and cannibalism. Nothing that a civilised person can't... how to put... get around. If he doesn't go mad from living with the natives, that is. But if he doesn't go mad, he can’t live here can he?”

Josh turned his back on the group, walking back to his high seat.

“So why would I be angry, for being essentially shipwrecked here for ten cycles or so? Long enough to forget what coffee smells like?”

He sat down, two slender and delicate looking natives settling by his feet. They fussed over him as he slid his spear into its holder.

“No.. I'm not angry. And to prove it, I'll invite you all to dine with me and the tribe. See, we're all friends here.”

Josh inhaled deeply of the smoky air, tangy with burning resin, a slow smile growing on his cracked lips. Josh looked over at the native he had addressed earlier.

“*Neeley? Tell the tribe that we will hunt today.*”

Josh steepled his fingers, smiling as he carefully, slowly studied the captives. The natives started to mutter excitedly, as the spacefarers looked around nervously.

“No, I am not angry at you. I am, however, a wee little bit annoyed at you all. So before we eat, we will play a... game. A game I have played every day for the last ten cycles or so.”

Dozens of tentacles reached out from the ring of natives surrounding the prisoners, deftly and quickly stripping them of weapons, radios, rations, and all other survival gear. Josh smiled wickedly as he leaned back.

“Wallace! What time did you end up calling it a night last night?”

Hayden Wallace, the oldest homicide detective in the precinct, paused mid-step partway across the bullpen and closed his eyes. He quickly counted to *five* before opening them and turning to face his squad commander, a woman closer to half his age. “Midnight, ma’am,” he said, going for a genuine smile that had won over so many women in the past.

The thirty-four-year-old female with a short brown bobcut strode across the bullpen to stare him in the eye. “I didn’t ask when you clocked out and snuck back to your desk, detective. I asked what time you walked out that damn door and went home.” She pointed at the double doors that separated Homicide from the rest of the precinct.

“I can’t remember,” he answered honestly.

“Perhaps this will jog your memory. Cooper just told me on his way out that he was surprised to see you back here, given you were still in the building four hours ago.”

Wallace rubbed the top of his balding head, mentally eviscerating a certain night shift sergeant who, in his mind, should’ve been drowned at birth. “That doesn’t seem right,” he said, pretending to frown. “Marrisa was still up when I got home.”

If anything, his squad commander’s scowl darkened. “How that woman puts up with your blatant lying is beyond me, Wallace! I mean it. You are out the door on time today, or I’ll put you on front desk duty until the day you die. Which at your age is probably tomorrow.”

“Love you too, ma’am.”

“What was that?”

“Nothing, ma’am.”

The woman was the same height as him and full of the same piss and vinegar that had served him for nearly forty years on the force. She stepped into his space until they were nose to nose, with her brown eyes staring at him unblinkingly. Hayden ordered himself not to flinch. Not even a little. “One minute past five, and you’re done. Try me, Wallace,” she drilled two fingers into his collarbone, then did an about-face and walked away from him.

Hayden held his position until she cleared the bullpen, then breathed out heavily.

“You brought that on yourself, old man,” Lyle Carson, his partner of twelve years, snorted. “I told you to go home when I did…”

“Oh, bag it,” Hayden faux-growled, smirking in appreciation of the coffee Carson held out to him while sipping on a second one. “Black and two sugars, right?”

Carson scowled. “One of these days I’m going to bring you a chai tea…”

“No one drinks that frou-frou crap but you.”

“Your lack of refined palette and my useless threats aside ... did you actually make any headway after I left?”

Wallace sat at his desk and reached forward for the on/off switch that would kick his computer to life. “Some,” he said. When Carson raised a dubious eyebrow as he sat opposite him, Hayden hmphed and added, “Maybe not as much as I was hoping, but I did make a few new connections and submitted a warrant request for Eddie Perkins.”

*“You* typed up a warrant request?” Carson repeated, his eyes widening comically.

Hayden growled and flipped him off. “Yes, I can fill out a fuckin’ online form when I have to, you asshole.”

Carson chuckled but shook his head, clearly not believing him.

Just because Hayden had broken more than one computer throwing it across the room when the damn thing hadn’t done what he wanted (he considered it a win when he hadn’t drawn his gun and shot it first), and his partner had banned him from doing anything but read emails and case files and add his notes to Carson’s reports, was entirely NOT the point.

Especially when last night, Hayden had realised the more he relaxed into the process, the more things fell together until they made sense. Maybe that was why he’d had such a hard time with computers before. He'd always fought them for supremacy instead of relaxing and letting them do their thing.

It had certainly paid off this morning.

While the computer turned on, he leaned forward to be closer to his partner at the desk facing him and whispered, “Keep an eye out for me,” then sat back in his seat. He opened his bottom drawer for a medicated ointment tube and pulled a medical sock out of his jacket pocket.

“You fucking idiot! You came all the way into work without a sock on?!” Carson snarled at him.

“Sssshh,” Hayden hissed, pulling his pants higher than his right knee to reveal a prosthetic limb from the knee down. He unbuckled the annoying thing that allowed him to continue working the last twenty-seven years and sighed in relief as the metal had rubbed parts of his nub raw. He laid a dollop of cream on the reddest part, then smeared it all over the nub, rubbing it in. “Oh, that’s better,” he sighed, then pulled the sock over the nub and slid it back into the prosthetic with only minor pain, buckling it all into place.

Carson was still frowning at him, but by then, the computer had started up, so Hayden used his clean hand to open their case files and emails while the other lifted his other pants leg enough to expose part of his lower leg. Years of habit had his fingers wiping off the excess cream on his hairy shin and calf before righting his pants on both legs.

“Gross,” his partner complained, just like he always did whenever Hayden prepped his nub in front of him. “And you’re lucky that thing didn’t swell up like a football, or you really *would* be stuck behind a desk for a week, and then where would I be?”

“I slept in,” he explained. As he ran his eye down the subject bar of his emails for anything uber important, he skipped over one labelled ‘Angela Benson’ and paused.

“Bullsh—what’s wrong?” Carson asked, watching him while skimming through his own emails.

“I’ve got an email here tagging Angela Benson.”

“Aw, fuck! Don’t tell me her scumbag husband is trying for another wrongful conviction hearing. We nailed his ass to the wall, fair and square.”

Instead of answering, Hayden opened the email.

And started to read…

…and watch…

…and read.

Twice, his partner tried to get his input on something, and by the second time, Hayden grabbed whatever was handy and pitched it at the man to get him to shut up, all without taking his eyes off the screen.

That got Carson up and around his side of the table, leaning heavily over his shoulder. “What the hell are you…” his words drifted off as he watched the same iffy footage that was clearly old, of a young, muscular woman in her mid-twenties straddling someone and smothering them with a pillow. She had strength on whoever she was holding down, and the hands that struggled to free the face and the feet that thrashed and kicked to buck the woman off were of a much older person.

“That can’t be real …” Carson said, reaching for Hayden’s mouse.

Hayden slapped his hand out of the way, determined to see this through to the end. After the victim stopped struggling, the woman held on for another minute or so and then climbed off him. She then spent time straightening his sheets and pillows to hide the struggle and cleaned them both up.

Then, despite having no audio, she tilted her head back and screamed long and loud, and people came running. The family were obviously wealthy. Apart from the furnishings in the room, the man who appeared in high-quality silk pyjamas ran to the bed, and after checking the man’s face, he collapsed to his knees beside the bed, pressing his head to the dead man’s palm. The level of distraught was genuine, and Hayden really felt for the guy. But it wasn’t until the woman rushed to the newcomer’s side and wrapped herself around him that his face turned towards the camera, and Hayden recognised him, even as servants swept into the room in a flurry of activity.

He paused the video feed and set it back a few frames to where the distraught man was facing the camera.

“Is that…?” Carson asked, moving closer to the screen.

“Tucker Portsmith, the king shit of Portsmith Electronics? Yeah,” Hayden said, swallowing heavily. “This is old. He can’t be more than twenty-five in that footage. And he was in the news over the weekend. Apparently, his secretary was a secret stockholder…”

“They call them shareholders now, and I heard she was his executive assistant.”

“Same thing.”

“Oh, for Christ’s sake, Wallace! One of these days you’re going to accept the sixties are gone and move into this century.”

“According to the Battleaxe, I’m gonna be dead tomorrow.”

“Try in thirty seconds if she catches you calling her that again.”

“Whatever.”

“Where the hell did this come from?”

“I don’t know – but according to the death certificate I just read, this was written off as hypoxia from a lifetime of heavy smoking.”

“They didn’t even do an autopsy on the old man?”

Hayden shook his head. “They didn’t need to. From what I read, he was a pack-and-a-half-a-day smoker who refused to use a CPAP machine at night when his doctors ordered him to. They were all waiting for the hypoxia to kill him, and as soon as they thought it had, the attending physician signed off on it and probably went home.”

“Well, someone was damn impatient.” Carson straightened and pointed at the computer. “You need to get a tech up here and trace where this email came from. Someone could be yanking our chain…”

“I don’t think so. I mean, I thought so in the beginning, but the paperwork looks legit, and it all correlates.”

“Shoot me that email,” Carson ordered, leaving Hayden and returning to his desk. “We’ll work with it from my computer while you get the techs in to find out where it came from.”

“How the hell does this shit even happen?” Hayden asked, doing as his partner asked.

“Rich people with deep pockets doing rich things,” Carson answered, though Hayden had meant it more as a rhetorical thing.

Hayden didn’t care if the Portsmiths were wealthy. Money didn’t buy him. He was close to retirement and had more than enough of his own, thanks to a rich company thinking they could get away with taking shortcuts in passenger van safety. His family had all been at the airport to pick him up from a case he’d been helping with over in Chicago. In one car drive home, he went from the happiest man in the world to the only survivor in his family who also happened to be hospitalised with his right leg amputated at the knee.

The company had tried to blame driver error on his father, who had been a city bus driver for well over forty years. It had taken twelve years for Hayden to finally clear his father’s name and get the payout that should’ve been his from the very beginning. Not that the money would bring his family back, but it was what the companies understood, and he wanted them to hurt the way he had. *Bad.*

So, to say he hated big corporations trying to hide things was an understatement, and if they thought there was a statute on murder, they were about to have another thing coming. Carson was right. He would have to let the techs confirm the date stamps on the files and bring the squad commander in to hear her thoughts on moving forward.

What he wouldn’t be doing was letting it fall through the cracks. Not on his watch.

If anything, it was a shame the supposed murder happened over twenty years ago, or he could organise an exhumation to look for pillowcase fibres in the lungs. But there was plenty in the email to work with: like a slam dunk conviction level of paperwork.

He went back to the emails.

Portsmith Senior deserved justice, and while it might be late, the victim would receive it if it were the last thing Hayden did.

Do I need porcelain on this or composite will just do? It says they will do ""onlay porcel/ceram-4+surface""

Please help me decide if it is worth it spending $500 on an ""onlay"". Is it the same as crown? Will just onlay be good enough for this tooth? Will it really last for a really long time? No cons at all? I would like to avoid unnecessary cost if I can but I am willing to invest in good quality that will guarantee the integrity of my tooth for like forever. I will loan for it if I can.

My dental insurance will only cover half of it if I go for the porcelain. I believe composite is completely free.

I believe the one I am going to is a reputable dental clinic. I hope so!

It seems like I am getting cavities on the same teeth that have prior dental fillings already. My question is why. Is that normal? If I am not mistaken, the tooth in picture has a 3 year old filling but I could be wrong!

I am so tired of going to the dentist, it seems like everytime they find cavities to fill every year even though I brush really well and floss. They even tell me I have very good dental hygiene, just need to improve flossing at the very back of my molars above. Why does it seem like I need more fillings more frequently than others ? :( What can I improve about myself other than oral hygiene  because I know I am somewhat ok in this and I keep trying to get better.

Thank you for those who will answer.

to add: I am not a smoker, not a drinker and I dont love sugary food. I LOVE coffee, I am a bit iron deficient. I brush and floss once a day.",1,1734477044.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

This has resulted in me being off work due to stress.

The last time I got like this was after a significantly traumatic event- >!I was sexually assaulted and repeatedly verbally harassed and abused by my university flatmate, who then went on to stalk me and one of my friends for over a year. !< I became incredibly withdrawn, stuff just stopped feeling like anything, and even basic things like hunger/thirst disappeared as I stopped noticing basic needs.

Right now, food feels like effort. I usually love to cook, it's one of the few things I am willing to accept about myself as relatively positive in that I am a good cook and I can cook all sorts of different meals. I also really enjoy food.

I can understand not feeling like the effort of cooking, but I can't even face the concept of \*eating\*. The idea of eating either feels disgusting or like far too much effort, so I have been living on canned soup, coffee and soft pasta with sauce from a jar. Anything else feels unappealing, and I've started losing weight.

Sipping her black coffee

Always too hot, so that she murmurs a swear as she puts it back down

Darts a look at her husband that he shrugs off

Used to the rhythm of their interaction

And she swings her feet up on the ancient ottoman

Stacked in the back, maybe there's a few books from the 70s next to the coffee cup

Maybe an antique spoon

And she thinks, I should call her--nah...

She's busy.

There are so many parts of adult life that qualify as clutter: 

The antique spoons, the yoga mats, the shredded silk lining on a jacket

The third phone case I bought this year, which I suppose

Is better than buying three phones--

The contracts, the emails, the text messages from your dentist's office

The shared Google calendars, the cut and paste e-invites

The forgotten bit of birthday cake

In the back of the fridge

The forgotten birthday.

When we die, our coffins could be lined with so many of these gasps

People used to put letters

Or flowers

We could line ours with detached keyboard keys, an empty yogurt container, a post-it note from 2004 

With the phone number of a friend we miss

And haven't talked to

Because we were both busy

We could die at any minute.  And yet I find I am bound to spend so many of my precious minutes

My time, my lost time

Losing what I love the most.  Is that proof that I am an adult?

Or would real wisdom be

Throwing all this shit away

And picking up the phone

Trading an orderly disaster

For the chaos of acute connection

Grasping like a miser

The lab rules say that we can keep our items there and mark them as personal or shared. I am a coffee fiend and brought in my machine, which I marked with my name (personal). It's just a cheap walmart one, you pour in water, add ground coffee and receive sustenance.

A few weeks later I noticed that sometimes, if there was a little coffee in the pot overnight, someone would throw it out and replace it with water. I was honestly confused why anyone would do that. Eventually I figured out that it was the janitors and they were using it to heat water for their noodles. I have nothing against them using the machine but -

1. The coffee they are throwing out is easily half a cup and sometimes if I have to be in early, I depend on drinking that while another pot is brewing
2. They leave water in the machine (which I never do) and more than once I have had it overflow because I did not check in my sleep deprived state.
3. There are like three microwaves in the lab, one of which is unmarked, that they can use for the noodles.

I finally put up a sign saying ""Please don't empty the pot"" and no one has touched it since. I do feel a tiny bit guilty since it was annoying but not impossible to share the pot.

I have a 4 year old maine coon mix named Persephone who hates people. She’s always hated people. She accepts affection from people on *her* terms, extremely rarely, usually late at night, she’ll come to my or my family members’ beds and demand pets. She doesn’t hiss or bite, she allows us to pick her up if we want to, but she squeaks in discomfort and hides her face. 

I can recall only one instance in my entire life where I or anyone else gave Persephone affection that was not on her terms and she accepted it— only a few months after we adopted her and her sister, her sister died very suddenly of a genetic condition (I can’t recall the name, but I know Persephone has been tested for this condition since, and does not have it). The rest of the family brought her sister’s body to the vet but I couldn’t bring myself to, I just sat at home crying. Persephone approached me and let me pick her up and hug her. 
(I know cats aren’t intelligent enough to understand complex things like death or grief, but I like to tell myself that Persephone can, and she needed that hug too.)

After her sister’s death, Persephone’s closed-off behavior got even worse. She spent most of her time hiding in my sister’s room. We’ve gotten more cats since, and she tolerates them, but doesn’t particularly like them. She’s the oldest, so the other cats respect her, but again, don’t particularly like her. 

I’m getting off-topic, but I think it’s important to get a good grasp on her personality to understand why this shift is so weird. 

A week ago, Persephone went under anesthesia for some dental work. I was very worried about her— while the anesthesia was wearing off at home, she was *extremely* closed off, hiding in places we couldn’t reach her and only eating when her food was brought directly to her. 

That behavior has changed, she is eating and drinking water, but I wouldn’t say she’s back to normal. She’s strangely friendly, now, constantly approaching people for pets and purring more often. She’s spending less time in my sister’s room, and getting along better with the other cats. She’s more vocal, too. The occurrence that pushed me to make this post was when she walked into the living room and started absolutely meowing her head off at me and the others as she rubbed her head on the coffee table and on the legs of anyone nearby. 

Nothing is wrong, I’m sure of that, and it’s not like it’s a bad thing, but it’s just… *so* weird. ",2,1734476697.0,Catbehavior,5,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

Industry: Data/Tech Consulting
Salary: $53k

**Section One: Assets and Debt**

Retirement Balance (and how you got there): $1.5k in a Roth IRA. I opened this in college and have been contributing sporadically ever since. ***This week I also open my 401k!***

Savings account balance: $4.8k in a HYSA. Most of this is my 2-month emergency fund, but I also earmark sinking funds here as well.

Checking account balance: $644.16 in my ""fun"" checking account (aka what I use to pay off personal spending/variable expenses) and $1.3k in my ""bills"" checking account. Every time I get a paycheck, I immediately transfer money into ""bills.""

Credit card debt: $0. I pay my cards off on time and in full every month. I have two cards:

* Discover It Student Cashback: $8.8k CL
* Capital One Quicksilver Card: $7.5k CL

Student loan debt: $33k in federal loans for a BA in Political Science and a BS in Education. I had a nearly full-tuition scholarship to a well-respected in-state public university. However, my parents had no savings for my education. Each year, I took out the full possible loan amount to pay for room & board, and my parents covered the remaining difference (around $1-2k). It was either student loans or community/no college, and going away to school allowed me to blossom independently, come out of the closet, make friends from all over, study abroad, etc. I'm not thrilled by the debt, but I'd like to say I made the most of it and undergrad truly expanded my horizons.

**Section Two: Income**

Income Progression: I have been working in my role for just about 6 months. My salary is $53k and I was not able to negotiate.

Main Job Monthly Take Home: $2914

**Section Three: Expenses**

I use Monarch to budget my expenses. (RIP Mint)

Rent: $850

Renters insurance: $19

Auto insurance: $169

Roth IRA contribution: $75

Savings contribution: $350.

Student loan payments: $350 ($20 above the minimum to my highest interest loan, lol)

Donations: No recurring donations but I volunteer with students (see below.)

Electric: $60-$100 monthly.

Wifi: $55

Cellphone: On my parents' plan. They're booting me soon so I'm riding this out as long as I can.

Subscriptions: $30, give or take. Random Apple charges I should probably cancel, and I pay for the family Amazon Prime membership... for now. That student discount won't last forever.

Gym membership: $30

Groceries: $250

Gas: I budget $100, but always ends up being closer to $150 due to LDR travel

Note: I am basically financially independent (minus the phone plan.) My parents both grew up in less-than-ideal homes, and while they truly broke so many cycles, I inherited intense money anxiety from them. When I was 11, my family declared bankruptcy. They are still married, but even after navigating that difficult patch, neither parent saves money. My mom is a big impulse spender and I try to veer the opposite way. I often feel jealous when I talk to other 22 year-olds who get help from their parents but I remind myself they don't owe me anything and being on my own builds character.

Note pt. 2: I am in a LDR with my partner of 3 years. (More like medium distance - 2 hours away by driving). We do not currently live in the same city and have no plans to move in the near future; we're both focused on starting out our careers right now.

**My 7-Day Money Diary**

**Monday**

6:15am - Waking up after a holiday weekend is not for the weak. Yesterday afternoon I drove 5 hours from my family’s place to my new apartment, where I moved 6 months ago. I brew some tea and journal on my couch. Sporadic as the habit may be, I’ve been a journaler for 5-ish years and it helps clear my head. I am already decorated for the holidays, and sitting by my tree ($30 on Facebook marketplace!) in the early mornings is one of my favorite wintry feelings.

7:00am - After a quick YouTube workout, putting away laundry, and Twitter scrolling, I head out the door. On the way, I call my childhood best friend W on my way to work. Gas is running low after Thanksgiving travel – *eh, I’ll fill it up later.*

9:30am - I finish my 1st meeting of the day, then recap *Wicked* with my manager. While I get myself situated and catch up on emails, I snack on chocolate-covered peanuts. I see an email that I can now enroll in my company’s 401k after 6 months of service– nice! A 6% contribution will mean \~$244 per month and get my company’s 3% match. Of course, it also times up with Open Enrollment - extra 401k savings means I’ll need to decrease my HSA contributions so I have some cash to spare because things have felt tight since starting my student loan payments. I’ll do that later.

12pm - Before lunch, I sip on some mint tea. I’ve been dealing with digestive issues and **excessive gas** and this helps prime my stomach for meals. TYSM to ancient Chinese medicine for this trick. Lunch is simple: frozen chicken vindaloo and garlic naan from Trader Joe’s plus peas for fiber. I’m rigid about packing my lunches, and almost always try for homemade, but I couldn’t be bothered to cook after getting home late from Thanksgiving. Re: the chocolate-covered peanuts because I love salty sweets. I start planning my family’s Christmas gifts while I eat.

2pm - I have some meetings to close out my day. I enjoy the clients I’m working with which makes the job feel a little less like work. However, when this project ends in the new year, I’ll be adrift (or in consulting terms, on the bench). I’m still figuring out where I fit in a tech environment as a people person with a policy background, and so is my org’s leadership. I’m a procrastinator and I know I’m not taking full advantage of my bench time but I’m not even sure what that would look like. In the future, I see myself excelling in project management. As I dwell on my professional shortcomings, I snack on some Pop-Chips for a quick savory fix. 

4:30pm - I head out of work and stop at Walmart to buy detergent and Mexican rice. Stores at rush hour are my nightmare but headphones help. Current podcast: new episode of Maintenance Phase. (**$25.35**)

6:45pm - Turkey taco bowls for dinner! I caught up with my college roommate S while cooking. She rants to me about grad school. I load my bowl up with the fixings: sour cream, shredded lettuce, corn salsa from TJ’s, spicy salsa verde from a local cannery, and cheese. I eat dinner while watching *St. Denis Medical* (thanks to my GF’s Peacock). While I digest, I shop for new glasses because EyeBuyDirect texted me about a great sale. 2 new eyeglasses & some prescription sunglasses are now on my way, paid for using HSA funds! (**$118.95**)

8pm – I call my dad to ask a life insurance question that came up while looking at open enrollment materials. We talk about Christmas presents and I start seriously considering dropping $400 to take my mom to see the *Wicked* tour because seeing it live is her dream. I try to finish my book club book (**$0 thanks to my library card**) but I’m really not feeling it. Laundry is my nemesis – I do some lazy tidying (aka folding and tossing clean clothes into my drawers).

10pm – My 5am alarm has been set. It’s a little ambitious, but I hope to go to the gym and I add some cute motivational messages to help me in the AM. I fire off some texts to my college roommates (we keep in touch despite being scattered across the Midwest after graduation), bid goodnight to GF, and head to sleep.

*Total daily spend:* ***$144.30***

**Tuesday**

5am - Major snooze button action going on this morning.

6:30am – After dodging alarms for the last hour and a half, I finally roll out of bed and drag myself to the gym, not even changing out of the hoodie/sweats combo I slept in. Whatever - going is better than nothing. I warm up on the treadmill then do some light strength training. I suspect I have ADHD because I get bored easily, and at almost everything, the gym included.  Especially when my budget-friendly gym tends to be busy at all hours and waiting is not my forte. GF is a fitness aficionado who loves to give me pointers but it’s still not my thing. That said, I know lifting weights does wonders for women’s health, and I’m trying to get into the habit as a 20something.

8am – Now showered and back at my apartment, I sit down for a cup of coffee & breakfast: chicken apple sausage and an egg. I also started my period, yuck. *And crap, I’m out of pads… I forgot to buy more*. I bring my last two pads for work today and decide I’ll stop for more later. My job is hybrid and we’re expected to be in-office 3 days a week, but it’s a small company, so I can bend certain rules a bit and come in later, which I decide to do today. I message my team that I’m going to take my 1st meeting from home then come into the office around 10.

11:30am – In the office now and my second meeting is over: another hour of confusion. I work with data engineers and it’s all Greek to me. Most of my responsibilities include note-taking and documentation to support project initiatives. My mind wanders into other life commitments during the conversation and I jot down some personal to-dos in my email drafts.

11:45am – I have a 1:1 with my manager where I ask about some tech acronyms that confused me during our meeting. We chat about their background in the public sector, which – sorry tech – is my true love at work as a policy grad. I brew some mint tea and snack on strawberry oatmilk yogurt with crushed chocolate peanuts sprinkled on top.

12:45pm – S texts me about a Travel Tuesday deal for hotels. We have a trip planned this spring. I book it for the Marriott points (my half: **$307**) However, the REAL story is that in the spur of the moment, I apply for a Marriott CC with no annual fee because I thought I could reap the points on Marriott spend for this reservation…. Except I don’t get approved right away and instead all I get are 3 emails saying there was a hard pull on my credit. Welp. On the Discover card it goes. I should’ve known that I wouldn’t get an immediate decision, and applying for a new card wasn’t exactly in my financial plan, but sometimes the gung ho spirit of get-shit-done overtakes me (except it’s never the thing I should actually be working on). Re: ADHD diagnosis I should probably pursue.

2pm – In my personal email inbox, I find an invitation to a retreat this spring for an org I’m a longtime volunteer with, all expenses paid,. *Ooooo*. Except my company’s PTO is *ahem* abysmal, and I want this to count as professional development time since it *is* technically a conference even if it’s not work-related. I quickly book a chat with my career coach (**free service via a professional org I’m in**) to talk this through. When my CEO stops by my desk to make small talk, I pretend like I’ve been on task all day. Pro of small company = lots of exposure to C-suite. Con = same exact thing because sometimes I’m not C-suite ready. I sip on turmeric juice as I try to lock in til 4:30.

3pm — I send over my final review of a deliverable to my manager, then I forward them a cool service-learning opportunity for their daughter based on an earlier conversation of ours. In another life, I’m pursuing a similar social justice gig, but today, I’m stuck in a cubicle farm staring at Excel sheets because I have student loans to pay. A bout of period troubles hits me (iykyk) and suddenly I'm so hungry I’m lightheaded. I heat up a leftover taco bowl and dig in. I consider asking to leave early because of cramps but decide to be a big girl… and because I haven’t exactly been exemplary today. 

4:30pm – I stop at Kroger for period supplies and because they have a sale on Ben and Jerry’s. **($19.67)** On the drive home, I call my dad to discuss the retreat opportunity. He tells me I should do it even if it means burning through personal PTO. 

6:30 – After rotting in bed for a while thanks to period cramps, I decide to skip my queer book club because I didn’t really like the book anyway. I text my book club pal that I won’t make it (turns out they aren’t going either) and instead head to TJMaxx for some Christmas shopping. I find perfect gifts for S and W – but I forgot my gift card! Oh well. I already had a Christmas sinking fund set up and I’ll be back eventually. (**$60.88**)

8:30pm – My neighbor H texts me that her car is in the shop and asks for a ride. Along the way, I stop for gas and fill up my tank (**$33.88**). After heading there and back, we sit in her apartment and chat for a few hours. She was the first peer I met when moving here, and she’s given me a lot of tips and support on adulting.

11:30pm – Woah. Up past my bedtime. I call GF to show her the presents I got for my friends, listen to a chapter of a new thriller audiobook, then head to sleep.

*Total daily spend:* ***$114.43***

**Wednesday**

7:45 – I catch up with a friend D over coffee. She drove 20 minutes to meet me and is newly engaged, so it was my treat. **($18.88)** I sip on a maple spice latte and make a mess of my croissant’s flaky goodness while we ooh and aah over her dress and recap our Thanksgivings.  

9:30 - Spotify Wrapped is out! I send my top artists to the group chat, as if anyone will be surprised that *Good Luck Babe* dominated my listening. While jamming to my 2024 Top Songs, I build a gift spending spreadsheet so I can keep track of the dents I’m making in my Christmas sinking fund. With $200 budgeted, I have about $130 left to spend.

11am – Having a career coach is like having a therapist for your professional life. This is only my second session with her and it is on an as needed basis. Today, we talk through my conference invite and the best way to pitch it to my manager. I decide that even if they refuse to count it as PD time, I’ll take some personal PTO for it, because getting flown out to something as a 22-year-old feels too cool to pass up on. I set up 15 minutes on my manager’s calendar to discuss tomorrow.

12pm – For lunch, I heat up Thanksgiving stuffing leftovers and pair it with some TJ’s sweet potato gnocchi. The period sweet tooth hits and what started as a scoop turns into half a pint of ice cream. While I eat, I listen to the newest episode of *Bald and Beautiful*.

2pm - After tying up some project loose ends, I join a retrospective call on a milestone my team just completed. This is the first meeting of this kind I’ve been in since starting this job. I appreciate hearing people’s honest takes on what could’ve been done better, and I jot down some notes to myself. Being early-career and adjusting to corporate speak involves a lot of “*oooh, I like that phrase, I’ll steal that for next time*.”

3pm - When I feel unfocused during WFH days, I pivot to light cleaning so I’m at least making somewhat good use of my time. I turn on a project management course to play in the background to play while I clean in case anyone decides to check my browser history. 

4:30pm – This fall, I started volunteering with a local speech & debate team. I loved this extracurricular in high school so it’s been a great way to invest time into my community and use some of my non-tech muscles after work. I listen to & provide feedback on a few students then chat with the head coach, who gives me all the speech tea. When I mention my company’s upcoming holiday party, she tells me about a consignment boutique near my place. I check the hours and it’s open til 7, so I have time to make it tonight!

6:55pm – I make a quick pit stop at the library with 5 minutes til close because my new book club hold is available. 

7pm – Shopping time! The consignment boutique is cute but not in a pretentious way. To be honest: I HATE shopping. I have no patience for it. TJ Maxx (aka knick knack and home goods shopping) isn’t bad, but clothes shopping is a nightmare. They have some cute options, including a rack of Anthropologie and Free People options, but nothing that screams corporate-holiday-dinner. I’m glad I stopped by anyway because what a cool local option. (**$0**)

7:45pm - For dinner, I have the last of my taco bowl then the other half of the ice cream pint. Not exactly the most balanced diet today but shit happens. While I eat, I watch an episode of Parks and Rec (*shoutout again to GF for the membership*).

8:30pm - I join a virtual meeting for an org I volunteer with. It’s been on pause for the summer and fall, and it’s good to see everyone. I make a running list of to-dos for my new role and onboarding a new co-volunteer. After my call, I remind GF to avoid *Survivor* spoilers on Twitter – this is serious business.

9:30pm – My mom texts about my Amazon cart. We still share a Prime membership, which means the cart ends up being full of 4 people’s random picks. I let her know she can get rid of it all because it was just gift brainstorming for friends. (**$0**)

10:30pm – After some good ol’ phone time, I begrudgingly do the dishes, wipe down my kitchen, and vacuum its floor. I have an early morning tomorrow and they’re unfortunately so right about the power of waking up to a clean space.

*Total daily spend:* ***$18.88***

**Thursday**

7:30 AM: Alarm goes off. I groggily roll out of bed. My office uniform is usually on the *casual* end of business casual, but today I have a conference, so I dress up a bit. My patterned maxi dress was a Black Friday find – it’s giving art teacher chic, but still corporate acceptable.

8:15 I drive to the office first, because today I’m meeting with my manager to discuss the conference opportunity. After our standup meeting, I hype myself up to really \~sell\~ why they should let me attend. They’re excited for me– yay, good sign!-- but they have to elevate it to the C-suite for permission. To be expected. I throw on my jacket and head back home.

9:30 – I meet my colleague Z in their parking lot. We’re carpooling downtown together. Z is always on time, so I quickly throw on a blazer in case I need to be dressier for the event. I get in the car, and we chat about the latest office drama—unpaid overtime, contracts ending, etc. Z is great company. It’s honestly nice to have someone else drive and I make sure to keep my Teams active just in case.

9:00 AM: We arrive at the conference, which is honestly a little bougie. The venue is sleek, modern, the kind of place you only go for corporate events. Think glass walls, fancy coffee stations, very tech-bro vibes. I grab a matcha latte (free! Corporate perks FTW) and feel very high-powered as I walk to my first session. It’s a great opportunity to network, so I try to make small talk with the people sitting near me and say hello to my clients who are also in attendance.

12:30 PM: Lunch time. It’s also free (seriously, can’t complain). Never mad about Jimmy John’s. Z and I swap her oatmeal raisin cookie for my chocolate chip one. (**$0**)

2:00 PM: I’m sitting in a session on AI in education but my mind starts to wander. I’m not really *learning* anything new, just trying to make sure I’m keeping up with the conversation for future meetings. I scribble in my notebook and make some serious front-row eye contact. One presentation shouts out my current project – I hope this makes a good impression on my higher-ups in attendance.

3:30 PM: Z and I grab another free latte for the road. (**$0**) She braves matcha for the first time and is unimpressed – more for me! During the drive back home, Z advises me on company holiday party attire. Thank god she reminded me because that’s next week and I have no idea what I’m going to wear. 

4:30pm – When I get home, I call my mom and we chat about holiday shopping and when I’m heading home. Somehow the United Healthcare assassination comes up and we have different takes. We go round and round. She tells me I’m an insensitive Gen Z-er and I ask why companies get to decide who lives and dies. I’m exhausted by it. We end up arguing, and I end the call early, frustrated and annoyed. I shouldn’t have engaged in conversation.

5:00 PM: I make a mental note to *not* call her tomorrow. Instead, I text my brother, who’s a freshman in college studying comp sci. Finals week is coming up, so I send him a quick “good luck” message. He calls me, and I end up giving him some advice on handling stress. He’s worried about failing one of his classes and I tell him almost all of my friends tanked a class at some point– it happens. Maybe it’s not *great* advice, but hey, at least I tried. 

7:00 PM: After wrapping up my social hour, I immediately throw on sweatpants. I’m not really in the mood for anything too intense tonight, so I start watching old episodes of *Parks and Rec* while I eat some veg frozen dumplings I snagged at the international grocery store.

*Total daily spend:* ***$0***

**Friday**

8am: I’m working from home today, which means I can roll out of bed later and not have to worry about getting dressed up. I throw on a sweatshirt and a pair of leggings—because that’s basically my WFH uniform—and sit down at my desk with coffee in hand.

9am: I send that recap email to my manager. It’s a quick check-in about our conversation yesterday and she lets me know she’ll forward it along.

11:00am: I finally get around to calling my old friend C. It’s been months since we last spoke, and there’s still a bit of tension from our falling-out. (TLDR: reunion in our college town gone wrong including a night out cut short and a failed tailgate.) But I’m determined to move past it. We scheduled this call last week; the conversation is a little awkward at first, but we eventually get into a groove. I apologize for my part in things, and she does the same. Honestly, I feel relieved afterward. I didn’t realize how much I’d missed our friendship. I tell C that I’m going to start sending her memes again because it’s been a rough few months.

2pm: The day is dragging on, so I decide to take a break and call my girlfriend. She’s working from home today too, so we often end up chatting, even though we probably should be working. We talk about everything—work drama, random thoughts, the latest news—and before I know it, an hour has gone by. Oops.

3pm - I get myself back on track by putting in a load of laundry, clearing off my kitchen table (it’s a mess), and finishing up my last few emails. It feels good to be productive again, but the conversation was a nice distraction.

5:30pm – For dinner, I stop by the grocery store behind my house to pick up some chicken chili soup. It’s my favorite comfort food when I’m feeling lazy. I also grab a box of saltine crackers because, let’s be real, soup is just better with crackers. (**$6.89**)

6pm – As I head home, I call GF back, and we catch up on the latest *Survivor* episode. I swear, we both get way too into it. We debate strategy and cheer for our favorites (>!Rachel, Genevieve, and Teeny!!<).

8:00pm – We remember the WNBA expansion draft results are out tonight. I’ve gotten really into the league this summer with my GF, and it’s something we enjoy together, even if it did hurt my bank account a little bit. Still, it brought us a lot of joy. 

10:00pm – By now, I’m fully settled into my couch. GF and I stay on the phone for a while, chatting about anything and everything. Long-distance relationships can be tough, but we’ve found our rhythm with these virtual dates. They’re not ideal, but we make it work. When we finally say goodnight, I set out my clothes for tomorrow and set a series of alarms—because, you know, I’ll probably hit snooze a few times.

**Saturday**

5:10am – *Yawn*. Tournament day. On early mornings, I need “defrosting” time to look at my phone so I budget this into my wakeup time. I get dressed, brew some coffee, then descale my electric kettle with vinegar and dish soap. I drive to school where I’m meeting the team.

6:30am – After a round of *Hellos* and *Good Mornings*, we’re all settled into the bus. I start listening a fluffy sapphic romance during the hour drive. Pro tip: if you’re paying for Audible, see if your library offers Libby! Huge collection of audiobooks for free; the only catch is a brief wait depending on demand.

8:45am – Caffeinated thanks to my thermos and the free coffee for coaches. I email my old speech & debate coach to update her on my new role and mentally prepare myself to listen to high schoolers talk all day.

12pm – Lunch break in the tournament. I eat a cold piece of cheese pizza (controversial opinion, but I love when there's a gelatinous layer of cheese on top. It's the best). I spend some time crafting cute slides for the org I volunteer with. Thank you SlidesCarnival for the Canva inspiration! Another cup of coffee incoming.

3pm – *Shiiit*. I realize I left my waterbottle in another meeting room. I trek back and awkwardly knock on the door to retrieve it. I've lost more waterbottles than I can count on one hand and I was not letting it happen again.

6pm – The bus ride back includes some hype for the team; I love watching them succeed. This is my last speech event until mid-January due to the school break. While I truly enjoy helping the team, I’m secretly happy for the break. Volunteering not only keeps me busy, adds to my resume, and introduces me to great people, but it also prevents me from mindlessly spending money on the weekends.

7pm – My downstairs neighbor, a retired professor, gifted two *Nutcracker* tickets to me & another young gal in our building. We meet up and head to the performance. Parking is free (shocking because event parking is usually a bitch), and even though we’re 15 minutes late, it’s a lovely show. I stare at the opera boxes and wonder what it would've been like to be a socialite in the Gilded Age,

10:30pm – At the end of the night, I take off my makeup, shower, and cozy up in bed to work on *A Swim in a Pond in the Rain*, which I borrowed from another one of my neighbors. I need to make sure I return it before the holidays. Though the last thing I wanted to do was leave my apartment after the tournament, it was so nice to make a new friend that isn't from work. I text my neighbor about making some other plans to hang soon.

11:15pm – Goodnight!

*Total daily spend:* ***$0***

**Sunday**

8am – I wake up and feel hungover. Not sure how I survived 4 years of party school but a 7pm ballet performance left me exhausted. I pour myself a large cup of coffee and confirm my plans for the day over text.

9:15 – I stop by my coworker M’s place to pick her up for bagels. There’s a trendy shop downtown and I haven’t seen her in a while since we’ve been in-office on different days. On our way there, we stop for lattes (**$4.98**). 

10am – Long line, but worth it. I devour my rosemary sea salt bagel with chili crunch cream cheese – DIVINE. I put chili oil on everything so this was a flavor combo come true. (**$5.41).** We run into a mutual friend at the bagel shop, yap for a few, then head out.

11am – After dropping M back at her place (and stopping in to pet her cat), I sit down at my kitchen table for some Christmas card writing. I’ve never sent out holiday cards but especially after graduating, it feels like the perfect way to keep in touch with long distance family & friends.

12:30pm – My neighbor H and I head to a queer craft market downtown. There’s a huge selection of screenprints, fiber arts, and edible treats all from local vendors. I buy two stickers for my younger brother (**$5**), an orchid cutting (**$3**), and a spider plant already in a gorgeous pot (**$5**). I had $15 cash so the money felt fake and I left the extra as a tip for the vendor. The spider-plant-vendor and I get to chatting about her business - we follow each other on Instagram when I get back home.

1:45pm – We bump into friends at the market and grab a table to debrief their night out. Adjusting to life after undergrad has been bumpy, but these little moments of camaraderie and unexpected hangouts are my favorite. I feel lucky to have met so many cool people across the city over the past 6 months.

2:30pm – I buy a vanilla butterscotch room spray that I know W will love; it’s the perfect addition to the spa day basket I’m putting together for her (**$12.84**).

4pm – The rest of my Sunday is pretty typical. I plan meals for the next week, call GF, shower, and try to beat the Sunday scaries with more *Parks & Rec*.

**Reflection:** This is a pretty typical week in the life for me. I tend to spend more money on food and less on shopping, but the holidays have gifts on my mind! Though I get overwhelmed by all of my plans, investing in my social network has been my #1 priority after my move.

1hgnb0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hgnb0z/has_anyone_heard_of_the_travelers_road/,Has anyone heard of the travelers road? ,"Have you ever come out of a daydream to realize you were driving? That you had ended up somewhere that requires making turns and stops, but you can't really remember making those turns or stops. You just suddenly realize, holy shit, I'm driving.  Well, that's how it started. 

 I was on my way home from college for the holidays. It was a drive I had made half a dozen times at this point. So, naturally I had become pretty familiar with the road. My mind was somewhere a million miles away, when I finally noticed the road ahead of me. I looked down at my hands on the steering wheel, I had been gripping it like a vice. The clock on my dash read 12:00 AM.  

“Shit.” How long had I been driving on auto pilot? I tried to remember but my mind felt so groggy. The last thing I could remember was flying down the road, jamming out to paranoid by black sabbath. Now though, nothing looked familiar. I was seriously tired, I needed to stop and get an energy drink or something. I looked further on up the road but beyond the headlights was just pure blackness, hopefully there would be a gas station or something within the next few miles, I seriously needed a pick me up. 

After a few more miles, and no sign of civilization I began to wonder where the hell I actually was. I should have been on Highway 9, which was the last stretch before I made it back home. At least that's where I thought I should have been. But, the farther I drove, the longer the empty darkness went on, the more convinced I became that somewhere along the way I had made a wrong turn. 

I reached into my pocket for my phone, but it wasn't there. Confused, I began to search around the inside of my car, but all I could see was a few discarded food wrappers and a half drank bottle of Gatorade. I decided to pull over and search for the little black dependency brick. I had never been very navigationally inclined. Honestly, I think I depend on google maps entirely too much, but right now I didn't care. I was lost and needed directions. After about 5 minutes of scrounging around under the seats and between the center console, I realized my phone was gone. I had no idea where I had lost it, maybe I had left it back at my dorm or maybe it fell out of my pocket somewhere, I didn't know. The only thing to do now, I guessed, was to just keep on driving and hope I find somewhere to stop and ask for directions. 

I reached down to turn up the radio but was met with only silence. I sighed, the radio in my car had crapped out on me a while back and I thought I had fixed it, apparently not well enough though. The next hour or so of driving was going to be mind numbingly dull without tunes. I glanced down at the clock on the dash and sighed, oh great, I thought, now the clock is busted too. The numbers still showed 12:00 AM. 

 I shook my head, “Baby, I love you, but you have some serious issues.”  

My car was my pride and joy, even if she had seen better days. A 1991 Camaro Rs, it was white with red racing stipes. The paintjob was custom but had seen better days, not to mention that the radiator was held together with JB weld, and it had over 200,000 miles on the engine. Needless to say, the old girl could use some TLC, that is, when I could afford it. I shrugged off my worries about the time and the radio and kept on driving. 

Eventually, up ahead in the distance, I thought I could make out a faint light. As I drove on, the solitary beacon grew brighter and brighter. A lighthouse shining in a sea of night. After what felt like miles and miles, the light finally resolved into a bright neon sign. The sign had a long green snake looped around fiery red words, The Midway Saloon. 

I pulled into the parking, and thought it looked about like any other dive bar I had ever seen. There were a handful of classic cars and Harley Davidsons parked out front, but the thing that stood out the most was standing there hitched to a post staring at me. It wasn't too unusual to see horses at bars, this was the south after all. But this horse was different, it was absolutely massive, solid black with a gleaming black saddle. The way the big animals' eyes reflected the light, almost seemed to make them glow.  

I parked next to an old Cadilac and stepped out onto the gravel lot. The warm air seemed to grow cooler under the giant horses' gaze, it watched me all the way to the door, the glow in its eyes never faltering.  Stepping through the saloon doors, I was met with the familiar smell of cigarette smoke and spilled beer. A jukebox in the corner played a song I had heard at least a hundred times but for some reason I couldn't place it, the patrons played pool, darts and leaned against the bar talking loudly.  

The bartender looked up from behind the bar. He was a big guy in a crisp white shirt and rolled up sleeves, he had a bushy beard and dark slicked back hair. He put down the glass he had been cleaning and met my eyes. 

“New around here huh? Well, what can I get you?” 

I nodded, “Uh yeah. Actually, I'm just passing through, but I'm not really sure where here is.” 

He smiled and shook his head, “Passing through. Thats a good one.”  

I sat down at the bar and ordered a beer, “So, I'm trying to get to Highway 9, but I think I made a wrong turn somewhere. Could you tell me how to get to where I need to be?” 

The bartender shook his head and sat the beer in front of me, “No, I can't tell you that. I can tell you however, you are a long way from where you want to be.” 

“What does that mean?” I asked. 

The big man just smiled and went back to cleaning the same glass. I glanced around the bar, noticing the way the people were dressed. It was like some crazy decades party or something. In one corner I saw a guy dressed like a 1950s greaser, playing darts with a guy who looked like an 90s punk rocker, blue mohawk and everything. At the other end of the bar sat what looked like a Wallstreet banker talking with a couple civil war reenactors.  

“You all having a costume party or something?” I asked the bartender. 

 He just smiled at me again and continued cleaning the glass. I shook my head and took a sip of my beer. 

Glancing around the bar again, I noticed a man sitting alone in one dark corner. He had a long black coat and a wide brimmed cowboy hat. “Is that the guy who owns that beast of a horse out there?” I asked, motioning to the man. 

The bartender stopped cleaning the glass as the bar went silent. I could feel every eye in the room fixed on me. Almost every eye. I looked around at the people surrounding me, then to the back of the room, where the man sat alone. His dark hat tilted up as he looked at me, he had the same cold glow in his eyes I had seen in the horse outside. I felt a chill run up my spine and my skin grew hot under that gaze. He didn't just look at me, he looked into me. It was like he could see down to my soul, to the very fiber of my being. I felt panic rising from nowhere. 

Just then I felt an iron grip on my arm. I turned away from that unnatural gaze and looked at the bartender. 

“You had best be on your way son.”  

I nodded and stood up from the bar, “Uh, which way do I go?” I asked. 

His face took on a grim countenance, “Just keep following the road.” 

I nodded, “What do I owe you for the beer?”  

Smiling warmly again he said, “First ones always free.” 

I frowned at that and he went back to cleaning the glass. As he did, the commotion of the bar resumed, as if it had never stopped. 

I stepped out of the strange saloon and avoided looking at the horse as I made my way back to my car. I just needed to get back on the road, and away from whatever the hell that was. Pulling back onto the blacktop I quickly left The Midway Saloon far behind me. 

 I had been driving for what felt like hours at this point, where the hell was I? How could I have become so lost?  

Just then I saw something up ahead in the distance. At first it was just vague dark shapes against more darkness, but as I got closer the shapes resolved into buildings and houses. It was a town. As the town came into focus, my exhausted brain caught up with what seemed so out of place. It was a town with no lights.  

“What the hell?”  

The road I was on led right down the center of the dark town. As I slowed down, I looked from side to side at the buildings lining the street. The buildings looked old, made of dark red brick and wood, but they weren't run down or abandoned just empty and dark.  

There were streetlights but none of them were on. I didn't see any other cars in the town either. Come to think of it, I hadn't seen any other cars all night.  

I pulled my car to a stop at the center of town and rolled down my window. The sound of my car's engine reverberated through the town; it seemed so incredibly loud in the utter emptiness. I killed the engine and stepped out onto the dark empty road. My headlights were still on and out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw something move out of the beam. I turned to look for whatever, or whoever was there. But I didn't see anything. 

“Hello?” I shouted.  

The echo of my voice bounced around and distorted before going silent. After a moment more of silence, I began to get back into my car when I heard it. 

“Hello?” 

Goosebumps rose on my skin. As I whipped around, looking for the answering voice. The voice that sounded almost exactly like mine. My eyes scanned the darkness, but I couldn't see anyone. This was wrong, this place it felt wrong. I couldn't understand it but I felt eyes on me from every direction, just like back at the bar. But I couldn't see anyone. 

“Hello?” I whispered under my breath.  

The moment stretched as the silence of the town seemed to swallow the sound of my voice.  

“Hello?” A voice whispered back. 

I spun and jumped into my car, my heart pounding. The voice had been right behind me, I could swear I felt a warm breath on my neck. I frantically rolled the window up and looked around for the voice but there was no one there. I reached for the ignition and turned the key, but the damn thing wouldn't start. 

Suddenly a streetlight at the end of the block started flickering on and off.  Standing directly under the light was a man. I couldn't make out many details at this distance but what I could see chilled me to the bone. His clothes hung on him like rags and his skin looked cracked and dark, like charcoal. He stood there crookedly, staring at me. When the light flickered back out, he was gone. I could still see the darkened streetlight but the man had disappeared, he was just gone. I turned the key again and again, 

“Fucking come on!” I shouted. 

When the streetlight flickered back on, I could see the man again, only this time he wasn't alone. There was at least a dozen charred figures standing under the light now. They jerkily moved and shifted towards me as the light flickered 

“Fucking come on!” The all shouted, in my voice. 

I watched in horror as they broke into a run just as the light flickered back out. 

Finally, the engine roared to life and I slammed it into gear. As I tore through the dark town my headlights illuminated dozens more charred figures. Their skeletal hands reached out for me as I blazed past them, I could hear their nails scratching into my cars paint as I passed them by. I accelerated faster out of the town and back onto the long dark road. 

My head was spinning, they weren't real, they can't be real. I could barely see straight, I briefly thought about heading back to The Midway but I couldn't stop. Real or not, I had to get away from that town. I had to keep driving, the only problem was, I could no longer tell how long I have been driving; time seemed strange. I stared down at the gas gage and prayed it was broken also; I couldn't remember how long I had been on half a tank. The road and the endless darkness beyond it seemed to stretch on for eternity,

 After another indeterminate time of driving, trees began appearing sporadically along the sides of the road. Eventually they grew in numbers until both sides of the road were heavily forested. 

The road began to twist and wind, what was once a long, straight stretch of emptiness was now a serpentine path through towering trees and woodlands. I was truly lost, but I couldn't bring myself to turn around, to face those things in that town again.  

When I came around the next curve, I slammed hard on my brakes. Right in front of me was a large old iron bridge. My mind raced; this was the first time the road had deviated from being anything but blacktop. I shook the feeling off, it was just a road. A very long uninhabited road. 

I stepped out of my car and looked around at the surrounding forest. It was so quiet, there should have at least been animal noises, right? Crickets, owls, coyotes, something. But there was absolutely no sound. 

I walked toward the old bridge; I wasn't sure it would be safe to drive across, I needed to get a closer look before trusting it to hold. My footsteps echoed through the forest as I stepped up to where the asphalt met the wooden planks of the bridge. The stared down, the dark pristine asphalt gave way to rotted looking wood. I cautiously extended my foot and placed it down onto the wood. The step seemed louder than it should have been and echoed down into whatever was below the bridge. It seemed sturdy enough, so I walked out onto it testing the structure by jumping up and down.  

“Is someone there?” 

I froze. It was a woman's voice, and it came from under the bridge.  

“Hello? Is... Is someone there?” she called. 

I turned as quietly as I could, began to make my way back to my car. The voice wasn't a mimic of mine this time, but I still didn't trust anyone who hung around under bridges. I made it three steps before the boards creaked under my step. 

The womans voice came again, “Hello? I need help. Please, I'm hurt.” 

I swallowed hard, the voice sounded sincere. What if it was someone like me, lost on this road and trapped down there? How could I just leave her down there? I decided to take a chance. 

“Hello. I'm here. Where are you?” 

The voice sighed in relief, “Oh thank God. I'm down here, under the bridge, I fell off and my leg is pinned under a rock. Can you please come down and help me?” 

“Okay.” I said, “Let me go get a flashlight from my car. Is there a path down I can use to get to you?” 

“Yes, I can see a path down. Just follow the sound of my voice.” 

I hurried to my car and grabbed a heavy Maglite from my trunk. Luckily the batteries were still good, and I was able to find the path that led below the bridge, “Okay, I'm coming.” 

“Please hurry, I've been down here so long. No one would stop to help me.” 

I was halfway down the path and paused, “You’ve seen other cars on the road?” I asked. 

The voice was silent for a moment, then she said, “Please hurry, it hurts.”  

“One minute” I said, “I think I have a first aid kit in the car. I'll just run grab it really quick.”  

“NO!” The voice shouted in anger before softening again, “Just come a little closer, I can see your light, you're almost there.” 

From where I was standing, the bridge blocked my view underneath it, but if I knelt down, I would be able to see. Slowly I bent down and shined my flashlight across the rocks under the bridge. 

“Thats it.” said the voice, “A little farther.” 

I panned the light to the left and saw a scrap of dirty white cloth. I stepped forward, looking closer. The cloth was part of an old stained dress. The womans body lay brokenly among the rocks under the bridge. She looked like she had been dead for some time. When my light shined on the womans face, she smiled. Her smile spread wider and wider and her eyes took on a manic excitement. 

“You found me.” She said, before bending straight up at the waist, her joints cracking like old kindling. 

As I began to back away, she leapt to all fours and darted toward me. I turned and ran as fast as I could up the hill and back to my car. My heart pounding. I could hear her right behind me, her hands and feet scrambling across the ground like a deranged spider. 

Just before I made it to my car, I felt an impact on my back. She was on me, biting and scratching. I fell to the ground and rolled across the road throwing her off of me. I jumped to my feet just as she lunged at me. I leapt back and swung the heavy Maglite, striking her in the head. She recoiled in pain and fell to the ground, sobbing.  

“Please don't hurt me. I just needed help.” She cried, holding her hands up in defense. 

I stepped back in confusion, “What? You attacked me!” I shouted.  

“No, I just needed help. And you hit me.” She sobbed. 

I shook my head, “I'm not doing this, just stay back and I'll leave.”   

I stepped back away from her to my car and opened the door. I only took my eyes off of her for a second, and suddenly she was on me again. Slapping the flashlight away and knocking me to the ground. She dug her nails into my shoulders and chest as she tried to bite my face. Her eyes bulged and her teeth were impossibly large and jagged. I couldn't push her off of me so I wrapped my hands around her neck and squeezed as tightly as I could, fear and adrenaline running through me. I squeezed my eyes closed and kept up the pressure until finally she slowly stopped fighting and went limp.  

I flung the body off of me and looked at it in horror. In death, she just looked like a normal woman, dirty and beaten, but normal. And I had killed her. I bent over and puked, disgusted and horrified at what I had just done. 

I had to get out of here, as I turned to get back into the car, the dead woman behind me started laughing. Looking back at the body, I could see she was still laying there. The toothy smile back in place, but her eyes were completely vacant. 

“Please don't hurt me.” She laughed. 

My breaths came quicker and quicker, ""What the fuck are you?”  

Her head turned to face me as her smile spread even wider. “I’m what you will become.”  

In an instant she was back on her feet and wrapping her hands around my neck. I felt my feet leave the ground as he squeezed my throat, tighter and tighter. 

I choked and kicked but I couldn't break free. Her jaw unhinged and stretched, revealing row after row of jagged, serrated teeth. I couldn't believe it, this was the end, and I didn't even understand what was happening. 

Just as consciousness started to fade, I heard a boom, like a thunderclap as a flash lit up the sky. I fell to the ground, choking and gagging. One of the woman things arms still holding onto my throat. I managed to pry it loose and looked up to see the stunned look on her face. Another boom lit up the sky and a burning hole appeared between the things eyes just before she crumpled to the ground in a pile of ash.  

I stood and looked back up the road, but I couldn't see anything. I heard him first, heavy footsteps accompanied by the jingle of spurs. Then out of the darkness, a pair of cold glowing eyes.  He was coming, and I wasn't waiting around to see what he wanted. I just needed to get the hell out of there. I jumped over the smoldering ash pile and into my car. I stomped on the gas pedal and tore across the bridge, praying I would find a way off of this fucking road. 

As I left the forested area, I pressed the accelerator even harder. The needle on the speedometer rose to 85 then to 100 then 120, I put the pedal to the floor and screamed out all of my fear, anger and frustration, “AAAAAHHHHHH!!!”  

 

Time and miles passed in a haze, I never stopped. Several times I came to places on the road where someone or something wanted me to stop. A tree in the road, a hitchhiker waving for me to stop, another rickety bridge. None of it mattered, I had to keep going. I’d swerve around or drive over whatever was in my way. My car took a beating, but she never stopped.  

I saw the horseman a few more times; I think he even chased after me once. I didn't care I just sped on. Whatever this place was it had an end somewhere, a way out or a way back, or something. I just had to keep driving...driving...driving...

 

I started woke up in the parking lot of a cafe. Glancing around I saw several cars in the lot and a big sign out front that said Al’s. Through the window. I could see several people inside sitting and eating, and going about their business. 

Had it all been a dream? Yeah, yeah of course it was a dream. A long terrible dream. I stepped out of my car and made my way to the door, I felt groggy and exhausted, that way you do after a restless night of sleep. I pushed open the cafe door and heard the bell jingle. Sitting at the counter I motioned to the waitress and she came over.  

“Hey Hun, what’ll it be?”  

I smiled up at her, “I could use a coffee.”  

She nodded, “Coming right up.” 

Setting a white mug on the counter, she filled it to the brim with the steaming beverage. I inhaled the aroma and smiled. I couldn't believe I was finally out of that nightmare. 

“You don't fucking belong here.” 

I looked up at the waitress, “Excuse me?” 

“I said, do you want sugar with that?” she said grinning down at me. 

I blinked in confusion, “uh... No. No, I don't.”  

The waitress smiled and nodded before turning back to the kitchen. I must still be a little out of it. I thought.  

Shaking my head I took a sip from the mug and immediately spit it out. The coffee, it... it tasted like... I couldn't even bring myself to think it. I looked down at the mug, and felt my stomach drop. What had just been a cup full of dark warm coffee, was now filled to the brim with a dark red liquid that smelled like copper and rot.  

I stumbled back from the counter, gagging and knocking over the stool, as the cafe erupted into laughter. I looked around at the cackling faces as the vile liquid in the mug began to poor over the brim and continued flowing out onto the floor, like some macabre fountain.  “No...” I was still on that fucking road.  

Just as I was about to turn and run for my car, every single person in the diner stood up as one and turned to face me. The laughing stopped and their smiles were replaced with an expression of pure hatred. Then they began to speak.  

A trucker in the corner, “You’re a unique one...” 

The waitress behind the counter, “We don't get one like you here often...” 

A little girl in a booth, “Not nearly often enough...”  

An elderly man at the counter, “The half ways always...” 

A young woman at the register, “Taste...” 

The cook by the flat top, “So...” 

A mother of three by the door, “Much...” 

All as one, “Sweeter.” 

I stood there, petrified as the moment stretched. I have to get out of here, now. I ran for it; I was going to shove and punch and kick every single one of these fuckers out of my way if I had to.  

I didn't make it past the first one. It was a middle-aged balding man, who looked like he weighed maybe 120ibs. I tried to shove him and run past, but his skin was like one of those sticky mouse traps and my arm got immediately stuck against his face. I tried to rip myself free but the others began closing in around me, their hands reaching out to take hold of me. I could feel dozens of hands sticking to me and pulling from every direction, I didn't know what would break first, my body or my mind. I screamed in fear, and the assembly howled in joy.  

Just as I thought I would be ripped limb from limb, thunder boomed through the diner over and over again. The tacky hands began falling away, and I collapsed to the floor. As I lay there trying to catch my breath, I felt a different set of hands of me. Large, ice-cold hands. I felt myself being pulled to my feet and dragged through the diner and out into the parking lot. 

As I was thrown to the ground, I looked up at my savior and winced under the glare of those eyes. This was the closest I had seen him, and it was horrible. His skin was pale and sunken, like an aging corpse. And his white hair hung in strands down to his shoulders.  

He glared down at me and pointed one long finger, “Stay.” 

His voice was deep and gravely, full of both age and power. He turned and started back to the diner pulling two massive revolvers from his belt. 

Through the window of the cafe. I saw the corpses climbing to their feet, most of them had large chunks missing from their bodies. One after another, the bodies began falling into each other. They clumped together in a fleshy gore coated mass, arms and legs and mouths jutting out in all directions. The mass began shifting its way to the door, all of the thing's eyes were still fixed on me. The pale gunslinger kicked the door open and began firing both thundering revolvers, knocking the thing back and blowing off massive chunks of smoldering flesh. 

 I didn't stay to watch the rest. Even though he had saved my ass twice now, he still filled me with a kind of dread that was all consuming. I jumped to my feet and ran around the massive black horse between me and my car. I cranked the engine to life and floored it away from the cafe and on down the road. I kept driving... and driving... and driving... 

Time lost all meaning, I never got hungry, never got thirsty, never stopped driving. I believed that I had found my way to hell. My suspicion was confirmed hundreds of miles later, when I saw a bright neon sign up ahead in the distance...  The Midway. 

I stood there on the gravel lot, staring up at the sign. The glow of the neon painting the night in shades of red and green. Only now could I see the snake for what it really was, an ouroboros. The paradoxical serpent, forever eating its own tail. There was no end to the road. No end. No beginning. Just an eternal loop of misery and darkness. I stared at the sign, my eyes following the coils of the snake around and around. My mind cracked even further and I began to laugh. I doubled over and fell to the ground laughing harder and harder and for a while I just slipped away... 

I don't know how long I lay there like that. After a time, I came back to myself. Sitting up from the cold ground and climbing to my feet, I made my way to the door and pushed through it. 

The bar tender looked up from wiping down the bar top, “Back so soon?” 

I numbly walked over to the bar, sat down on a stool and met his eyes, “I have been driving for days. Maybe even weeks. I can't even fucking tell anymore.” 

The bartender nodded, “Weeks, months, years...” 

My eyes had dropped to the bat top, but shot back up at his words. Had it really been that long?  

He noticed my panic and chuckled, “They're just words. They don't really mean anything here.” 

“So... Is this hell?” I asked  

He laughed, “No, it aint hell. It's just the road.” 

I shook my head in confusion, “But what is the road?” 

The bartender studied me for a moment before answering, “Well, some have called it purgatory, or limbo. But it aint really that either. This is the traveler's road, its where the lost souls of travelers end up.” 

My heart dropped, “So, I am dead.” 

He shrugged, “Not entirely. I couldn't see it before but there is still a thread of life within you.” 

“Wait, what? I'm still alive?” 

He shrugged again, “Partially, your life is in the balance as we speak.  I reckon that's why the Rider has such an interest in you.” 

“Why would that interest him? What is he?” I asked. 

“What he is, I don't rightly know. Around here, we just call him “The Rider”.  What I do know, is that he is a hunter. He wanders through all worlds and finds things that don't belong... and removes them. You not being fully dead, don't fully belong here. So, he isn't quite sure what to do with you.” 

I thought about the woman from the bridge and how he reduced her to a pile of ash. Would that be my fate? I didn't think so. He had his chance to end me on the road, instead he protected me. 

“On the road, there were things. Things that tried to kill me... 

He nodded, “The unnaturals. Vengeful souls that died of unnatural or supernatural causes. They feed off of pain and fear.” 

I swallowed a lump in my throat and asked, “What would have happened if they killed me?”  

His face turned grim, ""Then you would stay here and become one of them.” 

I shuttered thinking of the people in the diner. Were they lost souls too once?  I didn't think I wanted to know the answer. 

“If I die, will I stay here?” 

He smiled sadly, “I wish I could tell you, you'd move on. But I don't know. My guess is that since you wound up here in the first place, this is where you'll be.” 

I shook my head, “But why?” 

“Kid, I still don't know why I'm here. Some people do move on from the road, but not many and not often. It's one of life and deaths great mysteries.” 

Just then I heard the snorting of a horse from outside, followed by heavy, spurred footsteps. I turned to face the door just as it swung open. As the Rider entered the barroom the temperature dropped. I felt goosebumps on my skin as I stood and met his gaze.  

“Thank you.” I said my voice trembling, I took a steadying breath and started again. “Thank you, for helping me.”  

He stared down at me with that terror inducing gaze. The moment stretched but I didn't look away. Eventually, the Rider gave a small grunt and a nod of his head before turning and heading to his seat in the back of the bar. 

I turned back to sit back at the bar when I felt myself growing increasingly dizzy. My vision began to blur and I spun and fell to the floor. For a moment all I could see was the dim bulb hanging from the ceiling. But then the bulb grew brighter and brighter, until all I could see was a blinding white light and my ears were filled with a deafening ringing.  

Eventually I was able to make out a distant voice, “Hey. Hey Kid, can you hear me?” 

I tried to speak but, I had no voice. 

“If you can hear me, follow the light.” 

I did, or at least I tried to.  

“Good.” Said the voice. “Can you tell me your name?” 

I blinked over and over again. My eyes were so dry.  

“Hey, I think he's coming out of it.” The voice was calling to someone else.  

Reality slammed back into place. I was on my back, with a flashlight in my face, surrounded by paramedics. I turned my head to look around. Someone told me not to move, but I had to see. My car was wrapped around a tree about 20 feet away.  

“What time is it?” I asked. 

The paramedic leaning over me looked down at her watch and said, “12:01.” 

I felt tears burning in my eyes, I was alive. 

“You must have been having some dream.” Said the paramedic as I was loaded into the ambulance. “You were talking about bars and monsters and gunslingers. I think I would have liked to see that.” 

I smiled, despite the pain I was in, “Yeah, some dream. I'm just glad it's over.” 

It was a dream, wasn't it? Thats what I tell myself anyway, it had to be a dream. The heavy, jingling footsteps I heard as they closed the ambulance doors were just in my head. Weren't they?

1hgnawu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1hgnawu/graduated_15_years_ago_roast_my_finances/,"Graduated 1.5 years ago, roast my finances","I (28M) graduated as a software developer in The Netherlands about 1.5 years ago. I immediately started a job with a decent paying salary, don't drive a car (work is 15-20 minutes by bike), don't go on lavish vacations (I'm a volunteer at a sailing school, which takes up at least half of my vacation days), and I have a side hustle with two friends, we do workshops for student boards (very niche, and it's only now starting to pay out). I was living in a student house until 3 months ago, but got my own place, which is by far my biggest expense. 

I'm not necessarily looking to retire next year, I just want to know what my options across the board are. Any input is welcome! 

1. My monthly salary is €3424 after taxes. 
2. My monthly set expenses are 1956, which includes: 
   1. Rent: €1360
   2. Insurance: €166
   3. Phone and in-house internet: €62
   4. Spotify: €4
   5. iCloud: €10
   6. My bike: €24
   7. Water: €12
   8. Electricity: €82
   9. Coffee (for at home): €16
   10. HBO Max: €1.67
   11. Bank: €9
   12. Insurance deductible: €32.09
   13. Yearly gifts for friends and family: €63.34
   14. Any savings needed to replace big expenses (laptop, washing machine, etc.) within a reasonable amount of time: €105.98
3. I allocate €340 monthly for groceries and lunch at work, and €288 for 'fun stuff' (eating out, going to a bar, etc.). Near the end of the month, I often throw these on a big pile to cover the final days to my next paycheck. 
4. I save €20 for a collection I want to build (check r/bioniclelego for more details lol)
5. I save €175 for clothing (which I plan to bring down once I have my wardrobe finally filled, I haven't bought much since covid)
6. I allocate €100 for travel (public transport and if necessary car rental)
7. I save €180 for vacation
8. I save €215 for long term (right now for an emergency fund, later for investing)
9. I save €150 for big expenses that are fun. I recently bought an apple watch, a beamer is on the list. I also use this as margin and as a 'punishment' if I can't stick to the numbers above. 

I have €70k college debt, but I can take 35 years to pay that off, and that won't start until 2026. Then, it will be about €103 per month, and rise as my income increases. In 35 years, I'll never pay off the full sum, and the government will cancel it after that. I have to earn a much bigger salary to pay the entire sum within the 35 years, so I'll probably stay below that (free money yay). 

I also have a side hustle with two friends which just starts to pay out. Between €600 and €800 will be deposited to each of us next month. It's highly irregular, but I think it can yield about €3.000 annually. 

With minimal expenses, I need about €800,000 to fully FIRE, which means I can retire as soon as I receive social security from the government for my pension (assuming my salary never rises past inflation). 

What can I do? ",2,1734476175.0,Fire,0,0.6,False

Edit december 2024:

A little update on whats going on so far at the end of the year. 

In 2023 i started my coffee journey with a Jura E6.

Knowing that i need to change things i bought a Lelit Bianca V3 starring Niche Zero as coffee grinder in december 2023. 

Since then i did a lot of espresso shots, got some practice in latte art and bought other stuff to support my skills and coffee processing. 

This month i expanded my coffee grinder setup. Newly added a Eureka Mignon Libra. So far i love the new grinder. My journey continious. ",11,1734476001.0,espresso,7,0.87,False
1hgn8i5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hgn8i5,Beauty tanks,What do yalls beauty tanks usually look like? First pic is how we usually get them. Second pic is how I did it today when we had downtime and I needed a tank to push. There is about 2 boxes worth of freight on the second one which I feel like is more than enough. I don’t understand why they think we can do a tank like the first picture in an hour????? That literally blows my mind. The second one is perfect in the sense it’s separated like 90% for different areas of the department. I was able to put out the entire box of makeup within 5 minutes because it wasn’t scattered and buried. I just am curious to know if other people have this issue ,3,1734475997.0,TJMaxxWrkrs,5,1.0,False
