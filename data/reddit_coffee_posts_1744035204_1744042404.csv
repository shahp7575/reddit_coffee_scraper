## Navigating the World of Cuisinart Parts: A Comprehensive Guide

Finding the right Cuisinart parts can seem daunting, but with the right information, it's a straightforward process. Here's a breakdown of where to start and what to consider:

### 1.Identifying Your Appliance Model

The first step is to identify the exact model number of your Cuisinart appliance. This is crucial for ensuring you purchase compatible Cuisinart replacement parts. The model number is usually located on a sticker or plate on the bottom or back of the appliance.Common locations include:

*   **Food Processors:** Base of the unit
*   **Stand Mixers:** Underside of the base
*   **Blenders:** Base of the unit
*   **Coffee Makers:** Bottom or back panel
*   **Ice cream Makers:** Base of the unit
*   **Deep Fryers:** Bottom or back panel

Once you have the model number, make a note of it – you'll need it for all subsequent searches. This information will help narrow down search results for model specific parts.

### 2. Determining the Necesary Part

Next, pinpoint the specific part that needs replacing. Is it a broken blade in your food processor? A cracked bowl for your stand mixer? Or perhaps a Cuisinart lid replacement for your blender? Knowing exactly what you need will streamline your search significantly. If you're unsure, consult your appliance's user manual or explore online resources for troubleshooting guides and parts diagrams.

### 3. Exploring Your Options: Where to Buy Cuisinart Parts

Several options exist for purchasing Cuisinart replacement parts:

*   **official Cuisinart Website:** The official Cuisinart website is a reliable source for genuine Cuisinart parts. You can search by model number to find compatible components, ensuring a perfect fit and optimal performance.

When searching for Cuisinart parts, you'll encounter both genuine (OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer) and aftermarket options. Here's a comparison:

**Genuine Cuisinart parts:**

*   **Pros:** Guaranteed compatibility, optimal performance, maintain appliance warranty (in some cases), higher quality materials.

**Aftermarket Cuisinart Parts:**

While aftermarket parts can be tempting due to their lower price,it's generally recommended to prioritize genuine Cuisinart parts,especially for critical components like motors,blades,and electronic controls. For less critical parts, such as gaskets or plastic components, aftermarket options may be acceptable, but always exercise caution and read reviews carefully. Always use caution when considering aftermarket Cuisinart parts.

### 5. Understanding Cuisinart Part Numbers

My wife and I are taking on **Costa Rica for 16 days** at the end of May—with a **2-year-old**, a **Nomad America 4x4** (Kia truck), and just enough caffeine to believe this is a good idea. We're chasing waterfalls, jungles, volcanoes, and hopefully **not a complete toddler meltdown** in the middle of the Osa.

We’ve mapped out a pretty ambitious itinerary and would *love* your seasoned tips, route suggestions, and reality checks—especially from fellow travelers who’ve done this with kids or know these roads well.

**🔥 The Plan (a.k.a. “How Much Can You Fit Into a Toddler’s Naptime”):**

* **2 days** in the **Bajos del Toro area** to explore the Blue Falls
* **2 days** in **La Fortuna & Arenal** (Chato Volcano, hot springs, waterfalls)
* **1 day** in either **Monteverde or Santa Elena Cloud Forest**
* **2 days** in **Manuel Antonio NP & Biesanz Beach**
* **1 day** at the stunning **Nauyaca Waterfalls**
* **2 days** exploring the **Osa Peninsula & Drake Bay** for a Corcovado experience
* **1 day** at **Los Quetzales NP** (or another mountain stop on the way east)
* **1 day** at **Cahuita NP**
* **2 days** in the **Puerto Viejo** area
* **2 final days** unwinding on the **Caribbean coast**

**🤔 Questions We’re Losing Sleep Over (and Not Just Because of the Toddler):**

1. Any **must-drive scenic routes** off the main highways? Bonus points if you’ve got GPX tracks from past trips!
2. Is **Osa Peninsula** going to drown us if we go too late? Should we flip the trip and head there earlier?
3. **Monteverde vs. Santa Elena Cloud Forest**—who wins the cloud forest showdown?
4. **Drake Bay vs. Puerto Jiménez**—We’re leaning Drake, especially with a toddler (no boats pls 🙃). Good call?
5. Best way to **do Corcovado** with a toddler without totally losing our minds?
6. Any epic **coffee or chocolate tours** that are worth the sugar crash? Is Monteverde’s coffee tour a go?
7. Best scenic stop between Drake Bay and the Caribbean: **Los Quetzales**, **Tapantí**, or **Irazú Volcano**?
8. Last but not least—**where should we totally unwind** on the Caribbean coast? Looking for peaceful beaches, good vibes, and toddler-friendly downtime.

We’re pumped for this adventure, and would really appreciate any tips, warnings, or local secrets you’ve got. Thanks, Reddit legends!

Genuinely very helpful, and the post has a ton of good suggestions.

Since then, I tried a few things:

\- Cold Brew (I have an old mug kinda setup) and cold brew concentrate

\- A GSI Miniespresso

\- Aeropress Go

\- A steeper - basically a nylon net with a rim that sits atop a normal mug called a brew buddy

My main conclusion is that anything besides a coffee machine is gonna be good, haha. But I had some thoughts I wanted to share!!

1. For an aeropress, the fineness of the grinds mattered in my case. I used my normal coffee at first, and the water just went right through as I brewed! Once I switched to espresso grinds, it sat properly. That first cup I made was the absolute worst coffee I've ever had. Once I got used to the process though, the aeropress makes a very good espresso-type cup. It's legit. Cleanup is laughably easy and the easiest of all the methods so far.
2. the GSI Miniespresso is the most fun I've ever had making coffee, and it's a complete science experiment. I'll leave it at that. Coffee was good, total blast haha.
3. Cold Brew is how I normally make my coffee, and I tried to make a concentrate, and just failed. I'm using something called a Primula Burke and it's just a filter inside a pitcher. I make cold brew every week (that's just my normal way before all this testing), but the concentrate didn't take. Oh well, I don't need to learn.
4. Steeping couldn't be simpler! I made a coffee today. 12g of grinds (same as the aeropress on day 1, and same bag), and like 280g of water, steeped for a minute, and like - it was as good as any coffee I ever make. If I ever go backpacking, this is the way. I'm not sure if the brew buddy is heat resistant but it's big enough for a toaks 750. Also, I only measured so specifically because if it totally stunk, then I could adjust upward or downward. Now I can eyeball it.

This leads me to a mini-conclusion (I mostly did this for fun and curiosity).

I think I'd be  just as happy with cowboy coffee. Some of these methods produce grinds and the solution is simple, just let them sink. This is not a worry and the experiment was worth it.

Once it's back in stock, I'll try TJ's cold brew concentrate and probably a frozen cometeer since it's in stock at my local coffee shop, but honestly, I'm just happy I asked this question and it was awesome hearing so many different replies - and I think what it underscores is that making coffee is versatile.

For my astro roadtrips later this year, I think I'll be happy with the aeropress or brew buddy. Couldn't be simpler. Thanks again everyone!",3,1744042054.0,camping,0,1.0,False

Testing showed brew times unchanged between the stock config and new stainless config.

1jtow15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1jtow15/light_bowl_with_lid_for_rehydrating_meals/,Light bowl with lid for rehydrating meals?,"Hello! 
Ok, I know the most ultralight options for rehydration would be: ziplocks, talenti jars, or the pot I used to heat the water. That said, I prefer not to heat up plastic intended for single use as I find it adds a plastic-y flavor and probably weird chemicals to my food and I prefer to only boil water in my pot so that my morning coffee does not taste like last night’s dinner. I also find bowls less messy to eat out of than bags and easier to clean than something like talenti jars that have corners. I generally am rehydrating food that is not in the mountain house style bags meant for rehydrating—either it’s food I made or bought from grocery store ingredients or it’s a backpacking meal repackaged into a ziploc bag that’s easier to squeeze into my bear canister.
I just want a lightweight bowl that has a lid to keep the heat in while rehydrating dinner, but REI and all the other brands I can think of do not seem to sell this. Does anyone have a recommendation? Should I just bring some aluminum foil to cover the bowl I already have?

She allowed me to show the group how to crochet which she was there and this Saturday was mini golf. 

She showed up a little late and this one guy decided he was going to be the host and put teams together til she showed up. You had to have 4 people in a group. Their was 12 of us. I didn't feel the need to do this even though I was the one that suggest the place and event. She is still the host and I'm not one to overstep. I also don't like to cause conflict. Anyways he got in touch with her to have an extra event to where he can be a host next Saturday because she isn't going to be there. I suggest in the future to have the second Saturday as a different person do the host and plan fun events and she pretty much said that it's to much.

(21F) This is mostly about the things I take to try and combat my chronic constipation I've had my whole life for unknown reasons. When I was little, I took chlorophyll, it helped a little bit, but now it just makes me bloated. I took this supplement called Prokine for a while and that worked well, then it started giving me acid reflux out of nowhere so I had to stop taking it. 

Then coffee, Greek yogurt, or grape nuts cereal worked well for a while, now nothing. Psilium husk powder by itself with water worked great for a while, then not. Then I added magnesium to it, which sort of still works, but it is waning and I had a really rough experience on the toilet last night. I am thinking of asking my doctor about Trulance. Idk if that would help, or if it would give me too much side effects, or if my body would just adjust to it over time like everything else. 

Nothing has ever gotten rid of this long-term. It's so frustrating!! I feel like crap. Ba dum tsk. I am slightly overweight. I also take generic Wellbutrin for my depression, one of the only things that has actually continued to work long term. Even my birth control pills give me breakthrough bleeding every once in a while, and those are HORMONES, not drugs! HOW?! I take generic Concerta for my ADHD. The lowest dose worked temporarily in the beginning, but I am on the dose right above that and that seems to work better now and is lasting longer. 

I was low on some vitamins/minerals. I had iron deficient anemia so I took iron for a long time until it built up enough, but I didn't feel much different. I was also low on Vitamin D, K, and B, so I still take those every morning, and I still feel the same. Low energy. I have a somewhat inconsistent sleep schedule but I'm working on it. And I'd say I eat a fairly average diet. Why does it seem like my body is determined to thwort all my efforts to help it feel and work better? Isn't my body supposed to want me to be healthy and happy? Why won't it just let things continue to work?! 🫠🧐😮‍💨",1,1744041202.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

The TLDR is I had a pretty much perfect day, 8/9, 42.5kg PR total, Nationals QT and first PR total since 2023. videos here:
https://www.instagram.com/p/DH3VyOZAtwE/?img_index=1


This prep was the most consistent yet painful prep I've done to date in 9 years competing. Prep began with a blown hamstring/glute, a bruised rib and adductor tendinopathy. By week 3 of prep I had a chronic calf issue that made even just walking a 7/10 pain. This prep made me realize you have to want it. I didn't do anything like ""drop to 2 reds to get some volume in"" just because I was in pain. I did everything my coach wrote down because I had unwavering belief in what we were doing training wise. And it worked. This was our second prep together and we discussed that what needed to change was: more volume especially on squat, not hit @9 until final stretch of prep and only once, and alternate heavy lower body lifts. 

Onto comp day. I had my best meet day in terms of nutrition ever. I hate being bloated. I woke up unfortunately early (3am) due to a couple arguing outside my house. Had a 3pm weigh-in. Had 2 medium to small meals pre weigh in. From then on I only drank Sunny D and ate jolly ranchers, 1 cup of coffee. I felt my belt and like I wasn't bloated and that did the trick.

SQUATS: 

Warmups felt pretty good. Felt my legs do what they needed to do. We opened at 242.5kg, which I smoked. it felt weird on my back due to a very fresh, grippy bar so I just opted for no chalk after that. Second attempt, 257.5kg. Smoked that again.
Third attempt: 267.5kg. I really wanted to load the blue on squat this meet, and we did just that. Bar felt awesome when I un-racked. 0 doubt I had it even walking out. Smoked it. 10kg Meet PR.


BENCH:

Anyone who knows me knows I have a history of silly pec issues.
Warmups didn't feel great but I knew I'd have to knuckle up and not focus on that. So I did.
152.5kg opener flew. Second at 160kg I missed because I rushed setting up and wound up on the inside of my Avancus (L, rookie mistake). Moved well so we jumped to 165kg, which I smoked. 7.5kg meet PR. 


DEADLIFT:

By this point in the day I was feeling a bit tired so I just didn't think about it :) For context, I have missed 300kg in comp 4 seperate times. I made it in the gym last prep but missed again last comp (where I was plagued by grip issues out of nowhere???)

Warmups felt decent all said, opened at 275kg which was probably the fastest I've ever moved it. I knew I was on. 292.5kg second attempt also flew and I knew no matter what went on the bar for my third I'd smoke it. 307.5kg moved about as well as it possibly could have. 12.5kg PR. Definitely had more in the tank but the priority here was to QT and have a good meet day, not make YOLO sends. 


This was probably the most fun meet I've ever done. Was really stoked about the outcome as this meet meant a lot to me. 2023 till now has been pretty riddled with injury, doubt and poor training. I decided 8 weeks out I was tired of being disappointed with performances, no matter the outcome. This allowed me to execute, perform in the gym and consistently put the right weight on the bar for the day.

Particularly folks emphasizing ethical use of tech? Would any of you be interested in starting in a meetup to share experiences and/or hash out ideas?

Hey, Cville! I’m a local software engineer/engineering manager trying to figure out what comes next after moving through a season of autistic burnout that contributed to me leaving my previous position last fall. When I resigned, I had hoped that the market would come around by the spring, but then the election happened and, well, \*points at various dumpster fires\*.

Between the number of government workers in the area and the broader trend of industry layoffs over the past couple of years, I’m pretty sure I’m not alone. If there’s any silver lining to be found in our current climate, it’s that lots of out-of-work engineers/designers/librarians/etc. means lots of capable, creative folks with time on their hands.

I’d love to grab a coffee or a beer with other folks who are in the process of figuring out what could come next, whether that’s trying to find traditional opportunities or imagining something radically different (and not fundamentally exploitative!).

To be clear, I’m not trying to recruit people for anything. I don’t have an entrepreneurial bone (or neuron) in my body. But I do know how hard it is to toil in isolation and how uplifting it can be to meet folks who share your passions and can help refine your ideas.

Respond here or message me if you’d be interested -- even if you're not actively unemployed but are just done with the norms of this broken industry.",11,1744040476.0,Charlottesville,3,0.92,False
1jtobnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bromhidrosis/comments/1jtobnw/sweat_glands_removal_surgery_diary/,Sweat glands removal surgery diary,"I am suffering from stinky armpits for almost my entire life. It affects my personal and business life and drives rollercoaster with my confidence.

Recently I decided for a sweat glands removal surgery. And if you are now interested, feel free to follow here as I will provide updates on the process.

I hope it brings value to your stinky journey! Pls note that my first language is not English.

My background: I’m a a 35 year female. I have bromidrosis since my teenager years and I think I have better and worse times with stinky armpits. Some years the smell was moderate but I can also remember times where I left the shower and immediately smell worse than others after 10 hours of hard work in the sun. Also I had more sweat and others. In my mid twenties (approx 10 years ago), I decided for a miradry session (I cannot remember if it was Miradry or a similar procedure, but 10 years ago, it was super new and from the description and pictures, it looks like Miradry today). It absolutely worked for the sweat itself. I am almost dry until today. (Yay 1 problem solved).

The smell was still existing. And OMG it stinks! I tried all the things mentioned here in various chats from topical antibiotics to antibacterial soap, all kinds of deo… nothing worked much.

3 weeks ago I decided to go one step further and have a conversation with a beauty doc about the sweat glands removal surgery.

The conversation was nice, he explained everything in detail and told me that the price is 2,000€. They also did the sweat test with iodine and baking powder to check my sweating. Unfortunately I did not sweat at all (thanks Miradry 10 years ago), so he told me that he cannot assess where my sweat glands are and the only option is to do the surgery, on the skin where hair is visible. This is also not the ideal solution, as I have very little and light hair only (thanks for my laser hair removal). But at least it is an indication. I decided I want the surgery.

On the same day they also took my blood for a blood count and my blood coagulation values. The next appointment for an operation was already free in a week's time. And before I changed my mind, I took the appointment straight away.

Update 1: the day of the OP I arrived, did some paper work and a few minutes later i was ask to do some jumping jacks (to let the sweating start). A few minutes later I walked into the OP. They did the iodine and baking powder sweat test again. Still super dry armpits (damn). I did soooo many sit-ups on the OP table that my tummy still hurts, but without any sweat results. No chance to see the location of my sweat glands. We had to start without this information. I got some local anesthesia on my armpits and the doc started to cut my skin at 2 points of each armpit. Onto these cuts he filled more liquid for deeper anesthesia. Then it was 40 min of pushing water between skin and deeper tissue, scrapping the skin from the inside and suction of the liquid, the deeper tissue and sweat glands (yummy). With a few stitches the closed the cuts and after additional 30 mins and a great coffee I left the Clinique.

Update 2: the next 5 days The pain is low, I am only limited im putting my arms in the air and I need to avoid caring heavy stuff (great, 2 days of Netflix). After 2 days, I was allowed to remove the bandage and to take a shower (finally, my hair needed it). Surprisingly, 2 days without shower or any product on my armpits, there was no smell at all. THIS IS CRAZY. I took a shower, did not use any product on my pits. I send some picture to my doc for post operation checks and he confirmed that all looks great. By great he means that this super heavy bruises are okay and the skin heals normal. Now it’s day 5 after the operation. I shower daily and today is the first time that I noticed mild odor under my pits ( I am still without any product till 1 week).

Will share an update next week when my stitches get removed.",1,1744040466.0,Bromhidrosis,0,1.0,False
1jtoasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1jtoasa/did_you_find_a_single_blood_test_sufficient_for/,Did you find a single blood test sufficient for diagnosis?,"Hi all,

because of having diarrhoea (once per day) for several weeks, I went to the doctor.   
We did a blood test, and there is a >14x increased tTg-IgA value. 

I have no other symptoms and also no clear trigger. Okay, I cut my finger 2 weeks before and took a 2 year expired ibuprofen by accident. Or I got a new coffee machine 4 months ago that  had some silicon taste in the water I'm now worrying about. But I assume, the real trigger I might never know. Im 28 years old. 

The doctor was satisfied with the blood test and told me to simply give up gluten from now on.   
Yeah, nothing simpler when that. 

Is it normal to have only one blood test done? I did some of these self-tests for coeliac disease the day after (quite similar to a covid test but with some blood), but these were negative. 

So of course the the statistics are against me, a lab test is much more exact when a self-test, and I'm probably still in the denial phase. Just wanted to have your experience. 

As I already stopped eating gluten as recommended by the doctor, any further tests might also not be possible now ... or at least soon. ",2,1744040407.0,Celiac,2,1.0,False

1jto53f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jto53f,"Potager (KL, March 2025)","I haven’t really seen anyone post about Potager other than in some comments responding to requests for recommendations. I went recently and found the experience wonderful. The food was a fusion of French, Japanese, and Malaysian with a strong focus on Malaysian produce. A big part of fine dining for me is the presentation, and Potager’s is some of the most beautiful I’ve seen in a long time. Intricate and detailed. Like works of art.

The team is seamlessly efficient and affable without being intrusive. Chef Horiushi is a calm presence. Very nice and kindly gave me a tour of the kitchen and truly spectacular restaurant that is composed of a number of dining spaces, both private and open, including less formal spaces for wine enthusiasts and a test kitchen!

The dishes are:

1-4: Amuse-bouche. Really sorry, I totally forgot what these were and only recalled they included asparagus, a fish tart, and eel.
5: Chicken rillette.
6: Abalone, caviar, Guinea fowl onsen egg, and uni. This was delicious.
7: Corn bread and butter. I could have had a dozen of these. Warm and comforting. A really awesome bread course.
8-9: Foie gras and rhubarb, roselle, ginger vanilla cream, duck jus served with brioche. Wished they’d served this with more of the bread at 7!
10-11: Angel prawn, caviar, trout roe, beurre blanc. Delicious. Creamy, warm, and comforting bisque. Accompanied by a prawn cracker, which was very nice. 
12: Housemade bamboo cider and sorbet. A small, refreshing palate cleanser course.
13: Madai, mud crab risotto, miso, yuzu foam. It was nice but not my favourite dish because I’m not a huge fan of risotto.
14: Pigeon, morel, asparagus, chervil roots, and raisin jus. [For the main, you could opt for Omi Wagyu, but I decided to go for the pigeon because I don’t have pigeon that often.]
15: Cheese trolley. The cheese course is included in the menu but isn’t listed. I was wondering why the maître’d kept insisting I have some cheese. Lol.
16: Avocado, pomelo jelly, avocado milk sorbet, and lemon gel.
17: Cacao, Pahang 80% and rice puffs. The tart was excellent. Warm and gooey with the right amount of sweetness and bitterness.
18: Douceurs (petits fours). I can’t remember what they are, but I did enjoy them.

Note: There is a surprise, interactive course which I have omitted because I think it’s pleasant to be surprised. If anyone wants to know, PM me.

Note 2: Unlike the cheese, tea and coffee are not included in the menu. Wish I’d been told that, too lol.

Overall, a wonderful experience and one I’d highly recommend for those in or coming to KL. It is a Michelin Selected restaurant but hasn’t yet made it to Bib Gourmand or star status. I have to say though, I’ve enjoyed this more than some starred establishments!! They are at least worthy of one star, imho.

1jto4p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Budget-Cry635/comments/1jto4p8/is_jipmer_as_premier_as_an_institution_you_think/,Is JIPMER as “Premier” as an institution you think it is? A controversial opinion ahead.,"I recently got an opportunity to participate in JIPMER's academic extravaganza- "" Connaissance 7.0"". With high expectations I participated only to get all my hopes crashed. Well you might think, ""who are they to talk all this about one of India's best medical institute"" ""Maybe they are just jealous."" ""They're inexperienced, what do they know about organising a conference?"" But let me tell you something. Yes I am someone who had my hopes to get into JIPMER but let's say it didn't work out right but I did get into a decent university for mbbs. However, I have taken part in several conferences (international ones also) and even organised one in my college which happened seamlessly and I believe I can give my raw takes on this.

1. I have never seen any haphazard registration desk.

So on the morning of April 4th, my friend and I were waiting at the registration desk to get our passes. And my God it was so disorganised. There was no proper system in place, they ran out of the delegate kits in the middle and the place was utter chaos. Needless to mention about the very poor crowd management.

2. Delegate kits were sad.

We were given files made out of cardboard and some random bookmarks and keychains which are not even required. Well I must say their notepads were good. But what's point when you are going to charge us ₹800 for delegate pass and give below par delegate kits. One proper usable file, with a pen and notepad will do. There's no need for any of those useless badges and keychains.

3. Organising committee had no respect for the judges.

My friend was participating in case presentation, and the judge wanted the volunteer to start the timer for her presentation. The volunteer was on a phone call and he signaled the judge to wait. Mind you, this judge is a professor. Professor at India's top medical institute. Sheer disregard and disrespect. The professor then proceeded to start the timer in his own watch for the presentation. It was just painful to watch such a esteemed professor being treated with so much disrespect. Also he was given a sad samosa as a refreshment and he was made to sit at a broken seat in the corner. All the conferences I've been to and none of them were this disrespectful towards the teacher.

4. Lack of basic common sense.

* First incident: These people had two judges to judge a total of 20 presentations. Mind you, 20 presentations are around 10 minutes long that makes it 200 minutes of hearing people talk about cases back to back. Which is just stupid, because these judges are mere humans and they would get tired. And towards the end of the presentations, the judges lost interest and didn't care. There are two things wrong about this. One is you have to understand the plight of your own doctors, them sitting through hours of presentation with no break is exhausting and second is you are being disrespectful towards your own delegates who have paid so much and travelled from various other states to come present, just for the judge to ignore their presentation because they got mentally exhausted because you decided to bombard their humanly brains with 20 back to back presentations 💀👌
* Second instance. Empty certificates were handed to out to participants. This is when I lost it and it felt utterly stupid. Any medical student would know that the certificate that says ""xyz presented at this conference"" is extremely valued, and these certificates were handed out empty. You might argue what's wrong with this, but here's a thing. If it ends up in wrong hands people could misuse it easily. I could forge out 100s of certificates to people saying they participated at India's most esteemed medical conferences even if they hadn't. This just dishonours the efforts of the very few people who got selected among the 100s of abstracts they receive 👎

1. Poor communication. So this event got delayed and the organisers didn't communicate it to the participants. Okay that's fine but here's the hilarious part. These people didn't communicate it to the judges also 💀💀💀 So the judge came in, saw the participants sitting and he asked ""Are you the organisers"" The participants said ""No sir""

""Do you know if anyone from organising committee is here?""

""No sir"" And Judge 1 walks out. Few minutes later judge 2 walks in, people from organising committee were still trying to get the things arranged for the event. He asks where the other judge was and they said that the judge walked out and he's not reachable 💀💀💀

And the judge 2 proceeded to school the organisers about time management and proper communication which is something the organising committee lacked.

Like bro, the basic sense you should have here is inform the judges if there is any delay and ur delegates also. Your judges aren't some jobless people, they are people who have actual patients and leave their patients behind to attend your event. The basic decency you could have is inform your judges atleast about the delay and avoid public confrontation in front of delegates who are visiting your college. I'm sorry but that was just disgusting to watch 🤡

6. International conference claims?

Okay they claimed their conference to be international, but what was international about it I honestly couldn't find. If anyone knows what made it an ""international conference"" as they claimed it to be, pls HMU🙏

7. Expensive af. Okay so here's how it worked. If you are someone interested to present, you submit an abstract to the scientific committee. In order to submit your abstract, you have to pay from ₹300-₹800 and if it were to get selected, you have to do the basic delegate registration where you pay extra ₹800 and get that sad delegate kit I mentioned. Other shocking factor was, the delegate registeration did not cover food💀💀💀

All the other conference I've been to, the basic delegation  always covered one meal atleast. Even government colleges which charged us only the amount for event ( for example if I participated in quiz I pay only for the event and nothing extra for delegate card) I still got a really good meal along with it (it was yum chicken biryani mind you 🥹)

8. Zero acknowledgement.

My friend won the case presentation and she couldn't come to the valedictory ceremony. She collected her certificate beforehand and asked them to mention her name at the valedictory so she can watch it at live telecast. Okay you might ask what's the problem with this one.

See you have to know one thing, connaisance is very competitive. Taking apart and winning is not an easy feat, and the fact that people did and their names didn't get called on was just sad. It doesn't matter if they attended the valedictory or not, your basic human brain should know to acknowledge their efforts.

Note: well one remarkable they did was bring in experts to talk. Basically medical professionals who went above and beyond in medical field. Which was the only good thing about this conference, others I honestly don't know🤡👎👎.

Tips: (basically the basics you need to know when you organise a conference)

1. Please don't give out empty certificates to your participants 🙏. It ruins the value of the certificate since anyone can misuse them.
2. Organise your participants names in order and split them into desks so they can go to their respective desks to get their kits. This ends a whole lot of confusion
3. Please respect your own teachers who come as judges. It's just sad to see from an outsider pov when a premium institution students don't respect their own faculty. Mind you there are thousands of medical students who would kill to be blessed with the faculties you have so please treat them with respect. Give them proper seats and table where they can enjoy their coffee and snack.
4. Don't bombard two judges with 20 presentations. They will get exhausted. Instead keep 2 judges for 10 presentations each (4 judges in total).
5. Please stick to your time schedule since people have to travel back and not everyone lives within the vicinity of the college.
6. Provide what you can for the money you charge. Conaissance felt overpriced imo. For a cardboard file and few goodies, it wasn't worth the money at all.

This is just one of the many bad experiences I have listed out and there's many more. JIPMER being a premium institute and attending it's conference seemed like a milestone for me but in the end it didn't meet up to my expectations at all. In fact it was way below par. Not only that, it seemed they didn't care to deliver the bare minimum for the price of the conference. In conclusion, it was poorly organised, overpriced, overhyped and a clown show to see from an outsiders POV.

Sou um cara casual que não gosto muito de competitividade e discrimino qualquer prática de ofensa. Há um tempo atrás eu acabei me afastando de jogos online, principalmente de jogos competitivos, pois eu odiava ver muitas pessoas tóxicas, e acabei percebendo que aquilo me gerava muito estresse e me fazia mal. Sou meio preguiçoso, mas quando se trata de jogar eu desfruto do jogo inteiro.

Logo nessa linha de Zelda me recomendaram Majora´s Mask, e eu AMEI aquele jogo 7 vezes mais que o Ocarina of Time, gostei tanto que após uma semana de eu ter zerado eu quis zerar ele de novo. Dois jogos que eu gosto bastante é Terraria que eu platinei e Minecraft. Nunca joguei Bloodborne, algum Dark Souls, Elden Ring, e nem jogo parecido que tem gráficos extravagantes igual eles, mas sei que se eu jogasse eu ia gostar muito, mas já joguei jogos como Eldest Souls e Titan Souls, e eu acabei gostando MUITO, tanto que quase platinei o Titan Souls.  
 Alguns jogos parecidos como Dead Cells e Enter The Gungeon me conquistam muito, assim também como jogos igual Hollow Knight e Blasphemous.  
 Outros jogos que tenho muita vontade de jogar são Breath Of The Wild, The Last Of Us, Red Dead Redemption 2, Silent Hill 2 Remake e qualquer Resident Evil. Gosto muito de jogos parecidos com Stardew Valley e Animal Crossing. Atualemnte to numa onda de Super Mario e jogando vários jogos que possam ser jogados num 3DS old destravado. Também não posso esquecer que eu tenho mais de 400 horas em Pokémon Fire Red, Y e Ultra Moon. E pra finalizar essa parte sobre jogos que eu curto tenho que mencionar que gosto de jogos específicos com muito diálogo, tais como Coffee Talk que platinei o 1 e o 2 na Steam e Bravely Deafault que pretendo jogar e não conheço muito.

 Gosto de platinar jogos que eu gosto MUITO e zero todos os jogos que eu gosto, quando eu nao gosto muito eu paro um tempo de jogar e só decido rushar o jogo quando eu volto.",1,1744039460.0,u_llmboo,0,1.0,False

My husband and I are entranced with all things Georgian/Victorian/Edwardian - thus we have a small morning tea room. We're fully aware not all the pieces are actually antique but they do carry the style we love so it works. When we first bought our home we stumbles across a Victorian Co. couch and two chairs and immediately scooped them up. We knew there were other pieces that went with it but weren't willing to buy them for the insane costs on Cherish or any of the sort. After a year or so we we found a little side table I won in an auction for $12. It also came with a lamp from the 1920s and a Syrocco mirror so deff a win. We still needed the little coffee table though and everywhere I found them it was 300$ and up. Then it happened! One popped up on MP for $50 but it had been spray painted white then given a layer of sage green. After thinking it over we decided to chance it and I picked up. The paint was laid on THICK and had big dried drips running down the legs. 

It took a little over a week, many citristrip, scrubbing, sanding, picking paint out with clay sculpting tools, and trying to match the old stain on the rest of the set but we did and we cannot be more thrilled. It makes me want to find more pieces to bring back to their original state! Anyways. Thanks for listening to my story lol. No one is really as excited about this piece as my husband and I 😅

But the facility (one half museum, other half a sort of empty event space) is by and large dormant. 

The board is the problem. They are comprised of only six people (one was added in recent months) who are mostly non-local and non-active. One is around 50 yrs old, local but non-active. Two others, a married couple, are mid-60s, non-local and non-active. The remaining three are over 75, two of them active insofar as they unlock the doors and let a coffee group in once a week. The board, minus the new guy, has been the same since 2021, and the head of the board is both non-local and non-active. (By non-local I mean they don't live here but do own property in this town, i.e., a cabin.) 

The board to my knowledge meets only once a year. The guy who was recently added to the board is a friend of mine and he admitted that after 3 months he still hasn't been provided any bylaws. Everyone I know who's volunteered at this place over the years has also seen no bylaws. And the bylaws were not filed with the state.

Quite a few volunteers, including myself, are immensely frustrated by the museum's rapid state of decay and the board's ineptitude in the face of it. They are all people with a reputation for saying no to nearly all proposals that come their way. Inflation is rising while the endowment is not, meaning the annuity covers less and less each year. Meanwhile the property is violating numerous codes: mold in the basement, inadequate bathroom access, wheelchair ramp railing not intact. 

The head of the board is the primary problem. Her abrasive personality is renowned, as is her domineering nature and tendency to burn bridges. She's one of these types that has to be on every board in town, has to be the loudest voice in the room. Consequently, the nonprofit's four chief volunteers have quit over the past five months. 

Is there a way to resolve this situation? How do you turn over a board that won't turn itself over? The only real legal angle we have is proof the head of the board has fudged numbers on tax filings year after year. Probably not a by a huge margin, but there's sketchy stuff there on paper. Reporting this to the DOJ would simply revoke their nonprofit status. The board would remain, and they'd probably stick around just to spite the people blowing the whistle.

1jtnq9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/surfshark/comments/1jtnq9s/cybersecurity_tips_for_travelers_how_to_protect/,Cybersecurity tips for travelers: how to protect your data while exploring the world,"You're in the middle of a trip — your phone's full of photos, you're checking out that cool new spot, and everything's going great. But while you’re having fun, your personal data might be a little more exposed than you think. Consider this: booking flights, connecting to hotel Wi-Fi, or even scanning a QR code for lunch. It’s easy to forget that these small actions can make you vulnerable. Hackers know that travelers are often distracted, so it’s worth taking a moment to protect your info. Let’s go over some simple ways to make sure you’re staying safe on your trips.  
  
**1. Book directly, not through random sites**  
You found a great deal on a third-party site for flights or hotels, right? Hold up. That discount might not be worth the risk. Your personal data can be easily exposed when booking through lesser-known sites. Stick to official websites or airlines' and hotels' apps — fewer risks and better protection for your info.  
  
**2. Think twice before clicking links in emails or texts**  
You're about to book a last-minute flight, and suddenly, you get an urgent message from your airline. It looks official, but is it? Phishing attacks are tricky — they use urgency to get you to click without thinking. Always verify the sender before clicking any link. If in doubt, go to the official site yourself instead.  
  
**3. Public Wi-Fi isn't your friend**  
That free Wi-Fi in the airport lounge? It's the perfect bait for hackers. Public networks are often unencrypted, making it easy for anyone to snoop on your connections. If you absolutely need to use public Wi-Fi, fire up your Surfshark VPN.  
  
**4. Charging stations can be a trap**  
We've all been there — waiting for your flight, and your phone's about to die. But don't plug into just any USB charging station. ""Juice jacking"" is real — hackers set up fake charging stations to steal your data while your phone charges. Bring your own charger or use a portable battery instead. It's a small step but a huge security win.  
  
**5. QR codes aren't always what they seem**  
That QR code on your coffee shop table might seem like an easy way to get the menu, but it could lead you to a phishing site designed to steal your info. One out of every 50 QR codes hides a malicious link, so always double-check the URL for discrepancies before clicking. If something feels off, don't scan it.  
  
**6. Watch out for card skimming**  
When traveling, you're swiping your credit card at restaurants, shops, and even public transport stations. Be on the lookout for anything unusual around card readers. Hackers sometimes place hidden devices over real card readers to steal your data. If something doesn't feel right, try another machine.  
  
**7. Stick to trusted websites when booking activities**  
Searching for things to do at your destination? You might end up on a fake site trying to trick you into entering your credit card details. Always double-check that the URL is correct, and don't take the bait on ""too good to be true"" deals. If you're unsure, go straight to a known booking platform instead.  
  
**8. Don't skip software updates**  
It's easy to ignore that ""update available"" notification when you're busy, but those updates often contain security fixes. Hackers are constantly looking for vulnerabilities, and keeping your devices updated is one of the simplest ways to protect your data while you travel.  
  
**9. Set up multi-factor authentication (MFA)**  
If you're not using MFA on your travel accounts, you're leaving the door wide open for hackers. MFA is a small extra step that can save you a ton of hassle — it makes sure you're really the one logging into your accounts, even if someone gets their hands on your password.

At the end of the day, travel is about making memories — not dealing with a stolen identity or drained bank accounts. A little extra awareness can go a long way in keeping your personal info safe while you're out exploring. Sure, it might seem like a hassle to stop and think about cybersecurity, but it's so much easier than dealing with the mess of a data breach later. So, next time you book that flight, use public Wi-Fi or scan a QR code, just stay sharp. The world's waiting for you — just make sure your data stays where it belongs.",1,1744038964.0,surfshark,0,1.0,False

lol, there’s too much AI-generated content these days. Not only are we using AI to produce stuff, but we're also consuming a ton of AI-made content. It's getting to the point where we can spot AI content from a mile away.
AI has seriously boosted our content creation game, but as AI-generated stuff becomes more common, platforms like Reddit are starting to mark it as low quality. And of course, AI detection tools are popping up to help identify AI content. But throwing out AI just because of this? That’s like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
So, the real challenge now is: how can we make AI-generated content sound more human?
I can recommend some tools and prompt:
1. Tools:
- Grimo AI: I think Grimo AI should have a basic setting that lets you input the same prompt but get more humanized output. I'll find some examples on Reddit that I can use as sample, so the generated content will match the style of the sample I provide. You could even switch between multiple models to feel the different LLM effects (like Claude 3.7 sonnet, DeepSeek R1, ChatGPT O3-mini, etc.). BTW if you care about output speed, they’ve got a Groq option too. it’s ridiculously fast!!!
- Wordtune: Wordtune is this awesome advanced writing assistant created by AI21 Labs. It’s not just about fixing grammar mistakes, though. Think of it like a personal editor that helps you tweak your content, but it’s not great at coming up with stuff from scratch. That’s one of the reasons I don’t use it all the time. It makes suggestions to rewrite sentences based on context, helping you improve the flow and readability of your writing. It can even pick up on subtle differences between your content and others, offering tips to adjust the tone and style. Whether you’re writing anything, Wordtune is all about helping you polish your work to a more refined level. But hey! You gotta have some content to work with first...
- QuillBot: QuillBot mainly helps you improve the flow and clarity of your text, making it more human-like. It also offers grammar check features to catch any mistakes in spelling or grammar. For me, the most convenient part is the Chrome extension, but when it comes to content creation, it’s not as strong as the first two.
2. Tips:
- Tone of Voice: Direct AI to write like it’s having a casual chat with a friend Avoid the robotic, stiff language. Example prompt: “Review this content and rewrite it in a conversational, human voice, with a friendly tone that isn’t too casual. Use short sentences and simple words. Remove academic jargon and corporate speak. Make it sound like someone explaining things to a friend. Keep the key points but cut out unnecessary fluff. Here's the content: [paste your content].”
- Role Play: Give AI a specific role to make it think in a more human-like way
  Example prompt: “Imagine you're a high school counselor who's helped 100 students overcome their struggles. A freshman comes to you with major school stress and feels burnt out. Use a warm tone to relieve the stress and give some real-world examples.”
- Scene Setting: Get AI to use more natural language, like it's talking to someone face-to-face. 
  Example prompt: “Explain [content] as if you're having coffee with a friend. Make sure the transition feels smooth and avoid using formal words.”",1,1744038919.0,WritingWithAI,2,1.0,False

Not sure how to handle it.,"My wife and I (both 28) are basically not active in the Church anymore. No one outside our marriage really knows this.

We're digital nomads and travel full-time, so it’s been easy to keep our standing with the church quiet and to fly under the radar. I've slowly grown into a different place spiritually, and my beliefs have changed. My faith has expanded beyond the boundaries I grew up with. I don’t feel like I belong in the church the same way I used to. I'm not sure where that lands me, and I think I’m okay living in the open space for now.

My temple recommend expired about half a year ago, which I feel ok with. But my brother-in-law is getting married in the temple in August. I want to be there and support him. But unless I fake it or lie, I won’t be in the sealing room. That’s going to raise questions and start conversations that I’m not ready to answer right now, and I don’t want to lie to get a recommend. I don’t know how to avoid that. I don’t know how to be honest without making it a bigger deal than I want it to be.

I’m one in a family of eight, and so is my wife. Every single person in both families, immediate and extended, is an active, committed member. This won’t go unnoticed. And honestly I would feel sad missing out on it - not necessarily because I'd be missing out of the sealing, but because I'd be missing out on a joint experience the rest of my family will get to share with him and his fiancé. 

I thought the hardest part of renewing a recommend would be the questions around the Word of Wisdom (I drink coffee now) or garments (which I don't wear anymore). But reading through the interview questions the other day, I realized there’s more I probably couldn’t answer honestly—like a testimony of the restoration (which I’m unsure about right now), or the questions on Sabbath observance and meeting attendance (I go to church *maybe* 50% of the time).

Kakagaling ko lang sa long term relationship around October last year naghiwalay kami dahil mas lumaki ang agwat ng preferences at mga  desisyon namin sa isat isa sa relationship, we started so great pero we are becoming different persons as our relationship progress hindi na nagkakauna waan so we decided na itigil na lang at maturely pinag usapan namin yun, masakit lang kasi we were so sure of each other pag nag titigan kami alam namin mahal na mahal namin ang isat isa we were driven, we were passionate at we were vocal minsan nga parang busi partner at professional astahan nang relationship namin hahaha but still it ended.

Ngayon moving forward na ako binigyan ko talaga ng time ang sarili ko, sumali ulit sa mga trend na activities nag hiking nag diving nag running era na din, nag heal nag move on. 

Prinepare ko talaga sarili ko nang sa gayun okay talaga bago pumasok sa bagong relasyon.

Sa eto na nag download ako ng dating apps bumble at tinder this March, mas nag focus ako sa tinder at kung ma de describe ko yung sarili ko above average sa mukha, sakto lang sa height 5'7, may trabaho at magaling makipag kausap. 

Bilang baguhan sa dating apps sa tinder may mga nag right swipe sa akin total 70+ kaso half dun mga gays may mga iba naman walang pics pero still puro smile padin isipin mo 70+ katao nagustuhan ka at sa bumble mga around 40+ at puro babae yung nag swipe although some parin ay walang pics sa kanila.

Dahil nag focus ako sa tinder doon ako mas nag spend ng conversations, yun una si E mas bata sakin 27 ako siya 24, maganda yung naging kwentuhan almost 2 weeks puro tawanan lahat exchange agad ng ig's although dump lang yung sa kanya parang mag bff yung convo until it suddenly died down at dry na yung replies one word na lang kung mag reply back hanggang sa di na nag reply, same scenario kay J 28 halos type ko talaga  grabe din yung convo umabot na hanggang madaling araw first time mag download ng telegram kasi dun niya gusto, doon kami nag video calls, sent ng mga pictures update everday for almost 2 weeks parang mag long time partner yung turingan na parang ldr although inaya ko siya mag meet for coffee kasi same city lang naman pero ayaw pa niya at understandable naman pero same scenario naging dry ang replies hanggang hindi na sumasagot at same parin sa third girl si M 26 although 5 days lang naulit na naman ang ganap kaya sa inis ko nag boost ako, pinagsabay sabay ko na lahat tinder at bumble inaaccept ko lahat ng nag swipe akin at todo ako sa swipe left kahit hindi na tumutingin sa bio nila at  mali naman talaga kaso na frustrate na at medyo may realization na hindi siguro ako makakahanap na sa dating apps, sa tinder 10 yung sinabay kung i chat sa bumble 8 at parang may pattern na akong nakikita, nag try ako maging upfront at magsabi ng expectations ko pero na oo off sila maging slow burn happy lang pero hindi rin umobra at marami pa may iilang same scenarios kagaya ng kay E at J pero sa huli wala pa rin may nag rereply pero kung kelan lang gusto at may pattern talaga once na wala na ang attention nila wala na talaga walang goodbyes walang unmatch wala, andoon lang naghihintay yung last question mo at reply back nila.

So naisip ko ano pa kaya ang kulang sakin kaya naisip ko mag download ng bumble at tinder ulit sa isang phone ko pero as BABAE para naman alam ko yung kumpetensya ko mapag aralan mga bios nila at pictures at kung pangit nga lang ba talaga ako sa standard ng dating apps so nag set up naisip ko mag copy ng mga pictures ng mga babae sa fb kaso parang hindi tama sa ai naman masyadong obvious so ginamit ko na lang mukha ko nag dl ng faceapp at niremove ang watermark so nang na set up na kita ko na yung POV ng mga babae maporma ang mga lalake, madaming bagets, madaming professional, at madaming madaming foreigner pero naisip ko hindi naman ako ata talo sa kanila maganda naman pala yung profile ko starting dun inisnob ko na mga dating apps at etoooooo 3 days later nag open ako ulit bumble, tinder sa main phone wala ganun pa din may mga nag reply pero napaka dry one word , yes or no answers hindi open ended kaya di na ako nag follow up pero yung sa isang phone ko sa babaeng ako SUS NAGULAT AKO 1000+ SWIPES SA TINDER 450+ SA BUMBLE at ang unang pumasok sa utak ko wala na stop na to na realize ko na yung mga experinces ko bilang lalake at bakit biglang naglaho na lang sila kaya dinelete ko na lang, kani kanina lang talaga.

So tanong ko sa mga girlies out there may genuine pa din ba sa inyo sa dating apps? For validation na lang ba talaga? For attention o masyadong lang madaming pag pipilian?

But then he abruptly ended things, saying he “couldn’t give me what I needed.” This blindsided me, especially since just the day before, we’d had a conversation about our pacing. I told him I was fine slowing down if needed—I love a good slow burn—and that communication was important to me. He admitted he wasn’t great at communicating about stuff like this but reassured me everything was fine and going well. So, yeah, his sudden step back was a shock.

Two weeks later, he texted to apologize for how he ended things. I called him out, pointing out that his actions didn’t match his words. 

Another two weeks passed, and he texted again, confessing he missed me and had ended things because he got scared—he liked me too much. He asked to meet for coffee or lunch to talk.

Fast forward to mid-March: I agreed to an early lunch, where he explained he didn’t feel like he could “be something to somebody” right now due to personal struggles (he mentioned job issues). He wanted to try again if I was open to it, and I agreed, but only if he’d communicate better. I was cautiously optimistic but didn’t put all my eggs in one basket, wanting to see if he’d show up differently this time.
Over the next three weeks, we hung out 2-3 times a week, but I noticed him gradually pulling back again. Then (April 5), he messaged me, saying I’m “perfect” and that he really likes me, but he doesn’t feel like he’s “romantically growing” with me. I haven’t responded and I’m honestly at a loss.

I’m distraught by the confusion and inconsistency. One minute he’s charming and intimate (e.g., flirty texts, spending the night), the next he’s pulling away. He even liked a March photo dump I posted the day after ending things with me (where he’s featured in a group picture) which feels like another mixed signal. I’m trying to give him the cold shoulder this time, unlike in the past when I was more forgiving.
Am I crazy to think romance in your 30s doesn’t just happen overnight? We all come into dating with trauma and baggage, trying to show up and be better for each other, but it takes time for guards to come down, right? I don’t know what to do … should I respond, keep ignoring him, or something else? I’m feeling so hurt and could really use some perspective. Thanks for reading.

I’m a 40-something guy living abroad, and I recently met a woman (early 30s) for the second time — we grabbed coffee and then went for a drink. We had a long chat. She opened up to me a lot about her life — said she’s been living in the city for 6 years, isn’t working at the moment, struggling financially, and even got emotional and cried during our conversation. I just listened, didn’t try to fix anything, and tried to be a decent guy.

I paid for coffee (she offered, but I had already paid). At the bar, she tried to pay again, but her card didn’t work, so I covered it. She said she’d get the next one.

At some point, I asked if she was hungry and mentioned I could cook for her, but she said she was fine. After we left, I messaged her and joked that I would’ve made her something if I knew how hungry she was. She replied, “Actually, I said yes I am 😅” — so I invited her over again, casually, but she said she’d already eaten and was heading home. I left it at that, saying maybe next time and kept it light.

The next day, I messaged her again asking how her day was going. She said she was “slowly moving forward” and told me she’s prepping to mint an NFT and buying BTC. I teased her a little about being vague and we had some playful back and forth. I told her I enjoyed chatting with her the day before, and that if I get all my work done, maybe we could hang out this weekend.

She replied:  
**“You know me, I can't make plans so much up-front 😅 but sure, let's keep in touch.”**

I’ve only met her twice but feel there’s some chemistry. That said, her message feels like a brush-off. I haven’t replied since because I feel I’ve shown enough interest and don’t want to chase someone who’s not feeling the same way. At the same time, I’m trying not to overthink it, maybe she’s just going through stuff and can’t give more right now?

What do you think? Is this a soft rejection? Playing it cool? Or worth keeping the door open and waiting to see if she reaches out?

I started doing 30-30-30 every morning in March 2024 (30g of protein within 30 min of waking up followed by 30 min of movement). This routine has worked in that it’s systemic - there’s no decisions to make. I have my coffee with Premier Protein shake instead of milk and then go out for a walk. I managed to lose 20 lbs which has been the most I’ve ever lost without medication or keto. The progress is encouraging, and I unconsciously start eating healthier portions and stop stuffing my face with junk. 

Coincidentally, around the time I hit the 20lb mark, a couple of people made remarks about how great I looked and how it showed I had lost some weight. 

And in goes the self sabotage. Over the past month and a half I have missed most of my morning walks, I got back to the junk food and the progress is reverting. 

What is it about hearing “you’re achieving your goal” that just makes you want to derail everything? It took a lot of willpower to get to where I am, why do I unconsciously want to throw it all away?

Hey there

Allow me to introduce myself—I am a reserved yet passionate introvert, seeking to embark on a journey of meaningful connections and friendships. As I navigate this vast world, I have come to realize that life's true beauty lies in forging genuine bonds with like-minded individuals. Today, I take a leap of faith to reach out to this incredible community, in the hopes of finding some amazing female friends to share laughter, stories, and moments of deep understanding.

For me, the essence of friendship transcends the boundaries of small talk and shallow interactions. I yearn for connections that delve into the depths of our shared interests, dreams, and quirks. Though I may not be the loudest voice in a crowd, my heart carries the weight of empathy and compassion, making me a keen listener and a steadfast confidant. From the solace of a quiet coffee shop to the thrill of a thrilling book, I find solace in the simplicity of life's little wonders.

In a world that often glorifies extroversion, I firmly believe that introverts hold the power to nurture profound connections. There's something truly magical about the authenticity that arises when two introverted souls come together in understanding and harmony.

If you resonate with the idea of finding a friend who embraces the beauty of solitude and shares the joy of deep conversations, then I wholeheartedly invite you to join me on this journey. Let's explore the wonders of the universe through the lens of our unique perspectives and build a bond that defies the constraints of time and space.

Together, let's create a little corner of the world where introversion blooms and where friendship knows no boundaries. I eagerly await the opportunity to meet some incredible like-minded souls who can share in life's ups and downs, triumphs and tribulations, and everything in between.

Looking forward to connecting with you

In our kitchen, the range outlet is on the same circuit as 3 other outlets on the same wall, to which we had a tea kettle, crock pot, and coffee urn plugged in during a party, which caused the 15 amp circuit breaker to trip.

After that, it took two visits to fix the problems with the oven not starting, and later it would start but shut off when it reached 300F regardless of where the temperature was set. They replaced sensors, the temperature dial, and the entire circuit board for good measure.

Reddit /afib is now the perfect place to go to hear conflicting opinions from a bunch of geezers that think whatever there doctor thinks is best for them must be best for everyone! Have palpitations every so often? Fuck it! Get an ablation! Who cares if it can carry a higher risk of killing you now than your afib in 50 years? And if you like that deal stick around in the comments so you can see a bunch of overweight old people who are completely out of touch with reality be condescending to me because I’m tired of everyone’s answer to everything being “do everything the pharmaceutical industry way” and “you’re gonna have an awful stroke and terrible complications!!” I have palpitations almost every other day. Afib once to twice a month. I take metoprolol tartrate 25mg once a day (supposed to be twice but it made me feel worse regularly.) the other day I had a few beers and caused a bit of an arrythmia and it went away. Right now I’m drinking a coffee and yesterday I had a monster. I know not everyone has it the same but if I have any recommendations to people who are new to dealing with this, it’s get the hell outta this Reddit. Stay offline, talk with your doctor and see what he recommends and weigh the options with yourselves and your loved ones. Nobody on here has answers for you even if they act like they do. Go live your life. Don’t let afib make the call for you, you are still alive and kicking no matter how old and in what shape but there’s always room for improvement. Eat better, get active, develop meaningful relationships with your peers. I don’t care how old just please do what I should’ve done forever ago and am about to do and just leave this Reddit and google.

1jtn1mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1jtn1mv/rosewood_mayakoba_review/,Rosewood Mayakoba review,"I just returned from the Rosewood Mayakoba and given how much insight I've gotten from reading various threads on here, I feel compelled to also share my personal thoughts and experience.

Overall, it was an amazing and fantastic trip.  I traveled there with my family to celebrate two milestone birthdays - myself and my mom's.  Prior to the trip, I did email the concierge about dinner reservations and a few other questions and didn't receive a response for almost a week.  That was the only hiccup, otherwise once we arrived there the service was flawless, a 10/10 for the entire trip. The staff was super attentive and went out of their way to make the trip feel celebratory and special.  I have a 4 year old daughter and little surprises were left for her in the room by our butler, including a bubble bath with balloons/floaties when we got home from spending the afternoon at the pool and beach. 

We booked a lagoon studio suite, and got upgraded to the deluxe lagoon suite.  I loved having the plunge pool and view overlooking the lagoon - i would start each morning having a cup of coffee outside and it made for a very tranquil start to the day.  Our rooms were in the 400s, which was the perfect location for us.  It was a short 5 minute bike ride to the breakfast area, which we did each morning.  After breakfast we would take the golf cart to the beach.

We mainly stayed at the family pool by the beach, which was perfect for my 4 year old.  Sadly, we didn't really get to spend time on the beach this trip.  The weather this past week (super windy) resulted in high tides.  Additionally, there was a lot of seaweed (I read it is particularly bad this year in the Riviera Maya overall vs last year) on the beach.  Staff was consistently cleaning up the sargassum, and despite their best efforts, there was still a ton.  That said, if your preference is to have an ultra wide stretch of beach, then other hotels would cater to that better.  We were fine with the smaller stretch of beach. The vibe at the adults-only area (aqui me quedo beach club) was nice, but the best pool IMO is the one next to the Lagoon by the breakfast area.  There are also free cabanas there, vs cabanas that you have to pay for by the beach pools.

As for food, I was prepared to not be wowed - we have pretty high standards for food, and have read some mixed reviews about the restaurants.  However, I was truly impressed with everything we ate on this trip.  The breakfast was delicious; we tried most of the items on their breakfast menu and helped ourselves to the continental spread.  Everything was super high quality and fresh.  For lunch, each day we would hit up La Cantina, the taco truck in the adults-only area.  I became obsessed with their Cajun corn ribs and shrimp tacos.  For dinner, we ate at Agave Azul, Zapote, Saffron (at the Banyan Tree) and Toro (at the St. Regis Kanai).  Of all these places, my least favorite was Zapote.  The cocktails were great but I thought the food was ok and not as fantastic as the other restaurants we ate at.  The vibes at Saffron and Toro were incredible - I highly recommend going off property to check both out.

A quick side note:  The night we went for dinner at Toro St. Regis, I got a chance to check out all the Kanai properties.  The Etereo (Auberge) stood out as a place I would like to  stay for a future trip. The Edition had fun vibes, and the least impressive was the St. Regis. While the restaurant we ate at was great, the hotel had very much a Vegas, corporate feel (not in a good way).  Note, these were only my first impressions.

Other RW thoughts:  

\- Spa was great and expansive - can spend a half day there totally blissing out.  My mom and I booked a massage but facilities are complimentary to all guests.  

\-There is a cenote and butterfly sanctuary on site that is worth checking out if you have littles. 

\- We also checked out ""La Isla Secreta"", which is an island speakeasy only accessible by boat. Thought it was ok - it was small and since not too many people know about it, it was kind of empty.  

\- I was concerned about the hotel feeling not ""lively"" enough and feeling too quiet and empty. It definitely leans on the tranquil side, but there was a good balance and energy to the place.

Overall, no regrets on booking this trip - it made for such a unique and memorable stay!

1jtmxw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kvssnarker/comments/1jtmxw0/judgers_vs_breeders_debate/,Judgers vs Breeders debate,"Who is responsible for fixing/improving horses within the western discipline? Breeders, judges, the association? 

As a non-horse person but a cattle savvy and generally savvy livestock person who also judges cattle shows, this is something I think about often when visiting this sub and I thought it would make a nice debate.  As stated, I’m not a horse person but from what I gather there is confirmation issues within western discipline that are getting worse and getting looked over when it comes breeding in favor of a certain look or trait that’s producing winners. These confirmation faults will likely/ if they aren’t already lead to soundness issues  within the discipline.  I’ll use foot size and too straight hocks just as my example. Where does the positive change happen? If judges at shows are using small footed, straight hocked horses to win then what incentives do breeders have to correct this trait? After all, breeding horses is a business. If your horses aren’t performing, then your business with suffers because the value of your horses will
less than. If you can’t produce winning horses, then how long can you stay in business? How can you make a profit doing that? Not just that, but who doesn’t love the high of getting a win? If you are breeding show horses, then one of your ultimate goals is to win.. and who decides on that? Judges. Judges by deciding winners and losers influence generations of horses.
Oh Walter Farley’s The Black Stallion wins every show he goes to for three years? And in following years his offspring started winning? Then let’s ignore his obvious attitude and breed him because he won and now his offspring  are winning.  (If you get this reference, I thank you.)

On the flip side: 
Yet as breeders shouldn’t look at your horses and their longevity and know that it’s an issue that needs to get fixed, and select studs to improve on your feet and hock problems? Breeders have an obligation to their animals and their breed to be ethical. Is it ethical to breed on obviously poor traits? (Yes, some traits and how bad they are is debatable because opinions differ- but that’s another can of worms). If enough breeders raise their concerns and start improving on these flaws, do they in turn influence judges? Does the change happened from the ground up? Do the voices of the breeders influence the judges? Should they? 

Another point you could make is—are the breeders backing judges in a corner? If all the horses in a class have the same issues then what can you do as a judge? What if your choices are a post legged horses with small feet or horses that look like a swamp donkeys? What do you do then? No offense to donkeys-I think yall are adorable.

Or at some point does the problem get so bad that the mini footed, post legged horses that are winning but going to crippled by 12 and getting POS? At that point then both breeders and judgers change because problem is so bad that it can no longer be ignored.

Ultimately, this is a very nuanced issue and I think the answer is clear….as mud. Personally, I think change has to be made by all parties. How it happens though? That is a question that I have no answer to. 

Anyways, I think this is an interesting topic to ponder upon. Let me know what you think. 

Apologies for any typos or grammatical errors - I only finished my coffee at the end of writing this point. I’m not sure if I’m firing from all cylinders yet. 


P.S. as far as I know, horse judges don’t give their reasonings for their decisions on microphone.. why not? Could this correct issues and hold judges accountable? If I have this wrong and they do please let me know.",7,1744037029.0,kvssnarker,27,0.89,False

How to Incorporate Functional Beverages into Your Daily Routine
---------------------------------------------------------------

Functional beverages are gaining popularity as people look for easy ways to boost their health and well-being. these drinks into your daily routine can be simple and enjoyable. Whether you want to enhance your focus, improve digestion, or support your immune function, functional beverages offer a versatile solution. Here’s how you can start enjoying these trendy drinks to elevate your wellness.

First, let’s explore some common types of functional beverages:

- **Mushroom Coffee:** This blend combines coffee with powdered medicinal mushrooms like lion's mane or chaga, providing potential benefits such as improved focus and energy without the jitters.
- **Kombucha:** A fermented tea rich in probiotics that may help with gut health and digestion.
- **Herbal Teas:** These can enhance relaxation, promote sleep, and reduce stress, depending on the herbs used, such as chamomile or peppermint.
- **Protein Shakes:** Often used for muscle recovery, these can be packed with nutrients that support a healthy diet.

To effectively integrate functional beverages into your daily routine, start small. You don’t need to overhaul your entire diet overnight. Here are some practical tips:

- **Replace Your Morning Coffee:** If you’re a regular coffee drinker, consider swapping out a cup for mushroom coffee a few times a week. This can be a delicious way to experience its potential cognitive benefits.
- **Add a Hydration Boost:** Instead of reaching for sugary drinks during the day, try a functional beverage like flavored sparkling water infused with electrolytes. This can keep you hydrated while also supporting your energy levels.
- **Pair with Meals:** Incorporate kombucha or herbal tea during lunches or dinners. Kombucha can serve as a tasty palate cleanser while aiding digestion.
- **Incorporate Snacks:** If you enjoy smoothies as a snack, boost their nutritional value by adding a scoop of protein powder or a sprinkle of adaptogenic mushrooms.

One key aspect of incorporating functional beverages is being mindful of your taste preferences. If a certain drink doesn’t appeal to you, experiment with different brands or flavors. For instance, if you find mushroom coffee too earthy for your liking, try a flavored version or blend it with nut milk for a creamier taste. This flexibility will make it more enjoyable to include these beverages regularly.

A great time to introduce functional beverages into your routine is when you need a pick-me-up. For example, if you experience an afternoon slump, reach for a matcha latte instead of your usual energy drink. Matcha can provide a gentler boost without the crash associated with sugary options.

Tracking how you feel after incorporating these drinks can help you identify which ones work best for you. Keep a simple journal of your energy levels, digestion, and overall wellness. This record can guide you in choosing functional beverages that truly enhance your life.

Another way to make functional beverages part of your lifestyle is through meal prepping. For instance, you can prepare a week’s worth of smoothies, integrating spinach, protein powder, and your favorite functional beverage base, making them easy to grab in the morning. Creating a routine helps you stay committed and makes it easier to reach for these healthful options.

Don’t underestimate the social aspect. Invite friends over for a functional beverage tasting party. You can explore different drinks and share the benefits of each with your companions. This not only makes it fun but also encourages a collective journey towards better health.

Cheaper by 200 euro, 10 square meters larger, beautiful balcony/hills views, but a good chunk further from the gulf (looks like maybe a 20-25 minute walk to get there?). Also has an extra bed so the kids won't have to share.

Very very close to the water so (I assume) great for walking around the coastline and having gorgeous views even more accessible. A bit more expensive, slightly smaller, ground floor with patio but no views. Kids will need to share a bed.

So I’d love your honest thoughts:

* Can the tiles work with my moodboard, or should we just install wooden flooring? The thing is, the tiles are in the entire house, so budget-wise it'll cost a lot. And I don't know, I'm a bit sad about removing good quality tiles just because they're old-fashioned...
* Any general feedback on my moodboard or overall decor plans?

  
A few details:

We need to keep our existing furniture: the dark grey furniture (TV stand, coffee table and cabinet), the black sofa, the dining table and chairs. The room combines a TV/lounge area and a dining space. Also our lounge area will double as a play area for our daughters.

I really want persian rugs, and my goal is to create something warm, cozy, comfortable, practical, and kid-friendly.

I’ve also attached photos of the room with other occupants' furniture (two different families: we own the house and we're getting back in it but it's been rented for a long time).

1jtmomi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1jtmomi/i_know_this_is_crazy_but_balancing_my_blood_sugar/,"I know this is crazy, but balancing my blood sugar made my symptoms significantly better","TW: talk of improvement in symptoms

And please, don't think that I'm here trying to say that diet will fix everyone. I totally ascribe to the belief that CFS is a collection of complex illnesses. But what I *am* saying is that diet provided a huge amount of relief for *my* symptoms and I'm going to explain my theory as to why that is.

So recently I started having attacks after eating, especially after my morning smoothies. Dizziness, sweating, shaking hands, depersonalization, really intense anxiety, etc. I called my doctor and they said she'd called me back. I reached out to one of my good friends who is a professional nutritionist who works in a metabolic clinic and told her what was happening and asked if she had any idea what the hell was going on, because it seemed to be directly tied to what I was eating. She said, ""That sounds to me like reactive hypoglycemia."" While waiting to see my doctor, she suggested that I start eating small meals about two hours apart and foregoing anything that might cause big spikes in blood sugar for me (simple carbs, sugar, limiting complex carbs, etc). Desperate to not feel like I was dying after eating my goddamn breakfast, I followed her advice.

Within two days I went from being mostly bedbound to feeling and 80% reduction in symptoms that have been plaguing me and ruining my life acutely for at least a year. I've had to quit my job. My husband has had to make me meals.  He's often had to pull me up to a sitting position so I can get out of bed and go to the bathroom. And suddenly, I'm up and around and feeling like an almost normal person again.

What the \*hell\*, right?

I'm still waiting to see my doctor, but I don't expect much from her. She didn't even know that Ehlers Danlos Syndrome was a connective tissue disease the first time I went to see her. 

So I've been trying to figure out what the hell is going on on my own. I live in a ""brain drain"" state and we have a serious shortage of specialist, *especially* specialists who know shit about shit when it comes to chronic illness.

So I've been going down a bunch of rabbit holes, trying to figure out why balancing my blood sugar would cause a significant change in my symptoms.

So, after reading a lot I've come up with a hypothesis. I can't actually test it, but I've cobbled together a lot of scientific papers and drawn dots between things. I don't know if I'm right. I don't have the means to test this because I'm not a scientific researcher, and I don't have any doctors anywhere near me who might know *anything* about this, so I'm having to just go it alone here.

But my theory is:

POTS has been at the root of this hellishness. A question that remains for me, though, is: has this been a really intense case of dysautonomia the whole time that has mimicked CFS, or do I indeed still have CFS but it was being exacerbated horribly by unchecked dysautonomia?

I don't know.

Therefore, I'm proceeding with caution. I am MUCH more able than I was and I'm trying to cautiously figure out whether this new energy envelope of mine is restricted or limitless. I'm obviously really anxious about putting myself back. I didn't realize how fucking traumatizing it's been to be so ill until I'm feeling better and now I'm worried about getting worse again.

So, proceeding with caution.

But I've been able to do some gentle body work in the morning, help clean the house, prepare dinner with my husband for the first time in months and months, have friends over for dinner. My head fog is mostly gone. The dragging, debilitating, horrible feeling of walking through deep water all day every day is gone. I've been dong things that were completely inaccessible to me just a short while ago, that aren't putting me out at all. 

Just last week I was bawling my eyes out, intensely grieving everything that I'd lost, that I never thought I'd have again, and now I'm experiencing this insane whiplash because suddenly I'm much better than I was.

So, back to my hypothesis: dysautonomia has a really strong relationship with blood glucose levels. I am hypothesizing that by creating a lot of glucose spikes throughout the day with the diet I was eating, and subsequently potentially causing myself reactive hypoglycemia (which of course is still just a guess because I haven't been tested for it, but it seems quite possible), I was aggravating my POTS/dysautonomia so much that it was incapacitating me. By correcting and beginning to even out my blood sugar, the major antagonist has been addressed and my body is able to start functioning normally again. My fasting glucose has been tested in the last 6-8 months and it was normal. It's always been normal. But that, from what I gather, is the tricky think about reactive hypoglycemia--the blood sugar only drops after you've eaten because there's an intense spike in blood sugar. Fasting glucose wouldn't tell me much.

I actually found a doctor on YouTube named Maggie Yu who is very adamant that she believes that blood sugar is the number one underlying antagonist of POTS, which I found interesting. I mean, it's just confirmation bias, really, but it's interesting to know that at least one medical professional has been thinking about this, too. She says that she runs a 6 week women's health program and that in the second week they focus on metabolic health and balancing blood sugar and after that stage in the program, she has anecdotally but consistently seen a huge drop in symptoms from people who are suffering POTS. I haven't paid for her program, or anything, I've just watched her videos about POTS and blood sugar, but I think it's really interesting. She doesn't have research to present because, again, it's anecdotal, but still. Interesting. Something to consider.

I've found a lot of scientific papers that show a direct relationship between blood sugar and POTS/dysautonomia. But that only makes sense, doesn't it? The CNS is responsible for the regulation and release of insulin into the body. It would make sense that there's some fuckery afoot when it comes to POTS/dysautonomia, and that blood sugar could/might cause the symptoms to become even worse.

When I think about the symptoms I've been experiencing even before I started having the really noticeable attacks after eating: I've been drinking 1.5 to 2 gallons of water a day because I'm just that thirsty. I know that's insane, but I haven't been able to help myself because I feel like I'm so thirsty that I'll die if I don't keep drinking water. I've had horrible tachycardia, erratic blood pressure, tons of pain and inflammation, a constant need to eat something sweet throughout the day. The biggest canary in the coal mine for me is the drinking huge amounts of water. Since changing my diet, that has stopped and I'm back to drinking a sane three or four quarts of water a day.

I think it's worth mentioning that looking back I think I've had blood sugar issues for a long time (and my nutritionist friend agrees with me). I've always had a need to have sweets, especially after a meal. I tried to quit sugar a couple of years ago and I had symptoms like I was diabetic. Horrible thirst like I was going to die, constant need to pee, etc. My fasting glucose levels have always been normal, though, when I've been tested. But I think whatever has happened has just exacerbated a preexisting condition and that preexisting condition has exacerbated these dysautonomia issues. 

Anyway, as we all know, Covid has caused a huge uptick in POTS/dysautonomia, and of course there is a lot of overlap between CFS and POTS. I think Covid was definitely the catalyst of this for me. I also have EDS, though, and POTS is of course a very common comorbidity, Something that I find interesting is that a doctor at the University of Oklahoma named Stavros Stavrakis did a study on POTS where they stimulated the vagus nerve in the ear and found that it drastically reduced symptoms in the participants who had POTS. The vagus nerve, of course, also has a direct relationship with blood sugar.

So anyway, like I said I can't *prove* any of this. I'm not a research scientist. All I can do is measure my own lived experience and try to cobble together the research that *is* available to me to make some sense out of this really crazy situation. I don't know how all of these things fit together, but it is no accident that they all have a strong relationship with one another.

I'm just stating this here in the hopes that it might help even one other person get something of their life back. I could just be an anomaly, of course, but who knows. As I said above, I may very well *actually* still have CFS. I had all of the hallmark symptoms, including PEM. If I dared to do a little dance in my kitchen, I'd be in bed the next week. But again, that could also somehow be an expression of *really* intense POTS/dysautonomia. It's hard to say. There's been someone else on here recently (I'm sorry I don't recall their username) who has experienced a huge reduction in their CFS symptoms by, according to their theory, reducing their POTS symptoms because they moved from a high altitude to sea level.

It's hard to know anything with all this bullshit because there's so little research and with the way the government is going, it's looking like even less will be taking place in the US, but I hope we get answers sooner rather than later. In the meantime, we're all left to cobble together theories and remedies and everything else that we can.

To be clear, I believe completely in bioindividuality. What works for me will not necessarily work for you because your body is different than mine. But for posterity, this is what I've done to balance my blood sugar:

If I'm hungry, I eat. Period. And I'm obviously not eating full means. I'm eating little bitty meals. I've also started following the advice that you eat vegetable first, then protein because there's been some research that shows that this is the best way to send correct signals to your pancreas about how much insulin to release. I never eat more starch than protein. I avoid any simple carbohydrates and only eat potatoes if they've been cooked and cooled down because this significantly increases their resistant starch. I eat eggs for breakfast, never anything with sugar. I drink my coffee black. I eat every 1.5-2 hours and I think that this is key. I've never tried this before. I've always tried to be a healthy eater but I've always had a persistent problem with sugar regardless of how healthy I was eating (paleo, Mediterranean diet, etc etc, you name it, I've tried it) because I believe I wasn't eating often enough. 

I'm getting a referral to see a nutritionist who can hopefully help me continue to navigate this, and whoever else my doctor decides to send me to, but I'm grateful that I'm getting it figured out. This has also helped my insomnia and my anxiety ENORMOUSLY. I had no idea these things could be connected to blood sugar so intensely.

Thinking of all of you, wishing you well. <3

TLDR; resolved my CFS symptoms significantly by (according to my theory) inadvertently addressing POTS/dysautonomia symptoms by balancing my blood sugar after I started experiencing horrible attacks of what I believe were reactive hypoglycemia. Remains to be seen if I have in fact been suffering from CFS or if it's just been a debilitating case of POTS.

1jtmk8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jtmk8j/maps_are_not_too_small_hear_me_out/,Maps are not too small - hear me out,"Edit: title is wrong. Sorry. Need coffee 

I've seen countless complaints about maps being too large and players being too slow resulting in players feeling like the areas are a slog. I think that's not the actual reason you feel this way. 

In their recent update GGG has said they will look into zones where players spent too much time. I can translate that for you - each zone should take approximately the same amount of time. 

Time in an area is spent doing 1 of 3 things- walking around, killing trash mobs, and killing bosses. If you have multiple encounters per area, that means some of that time will be spent fighting and not exploring the map. The Grelwood for example had Areagne the Forgotten Witch, as well as Brambleghast. It also leads into a small area called the Grimwood Tangle that also had a miniboss (Rotten Druid). This means for us to spend 10 minutes here, the area has to be quite compact. 

Act 1 is packed with bosses for how many areas it had. There are 2 in clearfell, 3 in the grelwood, 3 in the cemetery of eternals (with an extra area as well) and 2 in the manor. All other areas also have bosses. 

If you look at act 2, it has the same number of bosses in total (15) but only 2 appear in the same area. That means to stretch out playtime in each area the devs made the maps larger to compensate. 

ACT 3 has only 11 bosses total, and you can see where this is going. If you look around in act 2 and 3 you will find locations that appear as though they should have a miniboss but don't. I think GGG simply ran out of time to flesh out the encounters and massively bumped size to compensate. 

This is also likely compounding with the base expectation of the MS you find on boots by that point. Vendors regularly sell 10% MS boots in act 2, and 15%-20% in act 3. This means devs, if I had to guess, took that into account and stretched areas in both directions multiplying by that. If you do this your areas go from 100% x 100% to 120% x 120%. But this doesn't make areas 20% bigger, it makes them 144% larger by area, or almost 1.5x larger than they would be. 


Players saying they want more areas really just want more tile sets because they associate that with more bosses. Arguably, fewer waypoints and more checkpoints with lots of content on each map is better for players for a smoother experience, since going between small areas can be a little annoying. I think they are adding more checkpoints now because they plan on the areas being more fun in the future, and creating a whole extra tile set that they have to fill with a boss anyways is a lot more work. 

Anyways thanks for listening, let me know what you think.",0,1744036058.0,PathOfExile2,2,0.2,False

[Breville Bambino / Shardor Conical Burr],"Basically I’m always really unsure if my beans are dialed in properly because I change multiple factors with each grind size, including tamping pressure (I have a weighted spring tamp) and gram amount.

I thought I found the perfect size for my philz if I do not tamp with full pressure. When I do tamp with the full pressure of the spring the coffee doesn’t even drip. But I read a post saying over tamping is a myth and your puck is either tamped or it’s not. Tbh I’d be really happy if that’s true because it would take (1) factor out of dialing in my beans.

If tamping should be done with the springs full pressure, but when I do that the espresso doesn’t come out, does that mean I should grind coarser? Should I basically be able to have a smooth espresso drip no matter how hard I’m tamping? I did this for a while in the beginning but found that as coarse as I went the espresso still wouldn’t come out but that was with my blue bottle beans so I’d be okay to revisit tamping fully if the consensus is that overtamping isn’t real 😅

Filter is Abaca Cafec for all tests.

1jtmc77,https://www.reddit.com/r/PAX/comments/1jtmc77/the_2025_pax_east_packing_guide_hail_hydrate/,The 2025 PAX East Packing Guide: HAIL HYDRATE,"Sup?

It’s just over a month to PAX East, and it’s the latest it’s ever been. At around this time, I post a packing thread aimed at helping first-timers or even vets figure out what they should bring on the floor, what they should have in their suitcases and overall how to prep for PAX. This list is based on my own experiences as a Montreal-residing 4-day PAX goer, so there’s some bias there: if I forget or overlook something, by all means, post below- this is meant as a helpful guide

Usually, I post a lot about keeping warm in New England during the late winter/early spring. This year there’s a change: almost a ZERO chance of snow (At least according to the historical weather data of the past 10 years) and warmer weather overall. What does that mean for packing? A few things!

 

**Things to note about getting in:**

· There is a security check when going in. There’s usually a separate line for people without bags, and one for people with bags. The bagless line tends to move faster. The new scanners they put into place a couple years ago are great, they move much quicker than the old ones, but it’s still faster to go in without a bag.

· Empty your pockets when you get to the metal detector: keep loose change to a minimum, it’ll help things move faster.

**On my person for the con floor:**

· A water bottle. **HAIL HYDRATE!**  You’ll get thirsty, and though the all-day access to Wild bill soda seems like a good way around this, it’s not: your body will need water at some point. Soda, energy drinks, coffee, etc taste great, but they’ll dehydrate you and well…calories add up.  Ideally you want something durable, light, and refillable. Nalgene bottles remain the ideal choice: indestructible, cheap enough to not fear losing, and available in a variety of sizes and colours.

· A bag of some sort. :  This is an insanely personal choice based on needs and preferences. My preference is backpacks: they hold more, and they’re more comfortable, but they’re bulky. Messenger bags and sling bags tend to be less bulky, but all their weight is on one shoulder, which can get sore after a long day. Drawstring bags can be shoved in a pocket and busted out if needed, but they don’t hold much, and the cords can dig into your shoulders. Choose wisely.

· A cell phone

· A Power bank (some use a power bar and find a wall outlet, but this tethers you to one spot for a while)

· A Switch/Steam Deck/handheld gaming device of choice + games

· Earbuds/headphones/etc: sometimes you wanna just sit down, zone out and listen to some tunes to recover for a bit.

· A small portable, analog game to play in line (Like cards, a small tabletop game, etc.). In my case, it's one of the many, many varieties of Fluxx

· Tylenol/Asprin/Aleve/Ibuprofin/Whatever - lifesaver if you get a headache or are otherwise sore

· Cliff bars/other munchies (If not a Cliff bar, I tend to pack beef jerky)

· Hand sanitizer. And more hand sanitizer. I use Bath and Bodyworks stuff: it smells better than whatever the con centre will have and won’t dry my hands out as much.

· Mints or gum – no one likes stinky breath, and it helps when you’re in a situation where you can’t brush your teeth for a bit

· A pen and a Sharpie fine point marker.

· Some people bring a poster tube to keep posters from being crushed. I’m not a poster guy, so I’m ambivalent about these, but they’re still a great tool!

**Packed:**

· Changes of clothes. I usually arrive Wednesday and leave Sunday, so I make sure I have enough clothes for each day: 3 pairs of pants (2 packed, 1 worn), t-shirts, overshirts, and underwear: one for each day, plus one extra. And usually 2 pairs of socks per day (more on this later).

· Hoodie/sweater- layering is a good idea!

· 2 pairs of shoes. Make sure they’re both broken in and SUPPORTIVE! I have seriously flat feet, and support is key to having a pleasant experience, especially as I get older. The idea behind 2 pairs is to rotate them: this helps keep your feet from getting tired and gives each pair some time to air out

· Hygiene supplies (Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant/antiperspirant, hair product, maybe a razor/electric shaver).

· Depending on how many people you’re rooming with, a towel can be helpful (Hotels often never seem to stock enough towels. This is less critical if you’re only 1-2 to a room). Just don’t bring a white one: you risk mixing it up with the hotel towels

**Misc others:**

· Cash: It’s gotten better, but the signals for credit card machines on the floor can get flakey. Hard cash wants no signal, hard cash \*needs\* no signal.

· I have a tablet or laptop for use in my hotel if I just want to zone out alone for a bit.

· Situational, but OTC sleeping pills.  They’re a big help if your roommates snore, or if you are a weird mix of utterly exhausted but too wired to sleep. DO NOT TAKE THEM IF YOU’VE BEEN DRINKING. The sleep won’t be as good as a night of natural sleep, and you’ll be sluggish in the morning, but a mediocre night’s sleep is still better than next to no sleep.

· If your roommates are like mine and snore like chainsaws: EARPLUGS. Wear them at home when sleeping for a week or so beforehand to get used to them.

· If you are from outside the US: Bring your passport with you to anywhere you plan to order alcohol. They may not accept out-of-state ID. They WILL accept passports. This is especially important if, like me, your driver’s license is in a language other than English (I’m from Quebec)

· If you plan to go partying, buy Gatorade. Drink it, it will help with the hangovers.

· For those flying/taking the train/bus/etc: A collapsible empty bag. If you pick up swag, you may not have enough room in your luggage. Nowadays, I usually pack a gym bag (empty) in my checked luggage if I fly to a con. That way, I have extra storage capacity if I buy a fair amount.

**Boston/East Specifics:**

· Check the weather before you leave. I can’t emphasize this enough. Boston weather is unpredictable. I just did a deep dive on the temperature on the dates of the event for the past 10 years: Average temp is about 60F/15C, with a high of 67F/19C and a low of 50F/10C.  But it’s gotten as high as the high 80s (about 30C) and as cold as the mid 30s (1C) in the last 10 years. It's unpredictable, but aim for the averages. 

· Bring a jacket, bring a hoodie, bring t-shirts, etc. Don’t worry about snow, but rain is always a possibility, so your footwear should take that into account - I hate Chuck Taylors for that reason: they absorb water and keep it in the canvas. Also, the wind coming off the water (it is the SEAport after all) can be \*biting\* at night.

· Pack an extra pair of socks in your bag- if the worst happens and you get wet socks, you don't want to have wet, squidgey feet all day. Spare socks help with this! Also, changing out your socks mid-day can help rejuvenate tired feet. Do not underestimate the power of fresh socks!

**The** **~~four~~** **five most important rules for the con:**

· At least 5/6 hours sleep. At least 2 meals a day. At least one shower a day. The con is closed between midnight and 10 AM. The parties tend to close at 2. Getting 5 hours of sleep, assuming you take an hour to get back to your hotel, is 3 AM to 8 AM. Similarly, it needs to be 2 full, balanced meals. A Vector bar is not a meal, and a bag of chips or beef jerky is not a meal. You can skip one meal without too much issue. If you skip two, you will be ravenous. Following these guidelines is the difference between feeling a bit tired and feeling like death warmed over.

· For all that’s holy, wear deodorant or antiperspirant. (Similarly, please don’t overdo the cologne or body spray or perfume)

· Wear good, comfortable, broken-in, supportive shoes. You’ll be on your feet all day, so don’t skimp on this.

· Bring your good cheer and good manners

**· HAIL HYDRATE**

 

As a side note: There are small folding camping stools you can buy, and they're often used to sit on while waiting in line. Some people say they're essential. Other folks (of whom I'm one) think they're just extra bulk for a little extra benefit. This is extremely personal, but you can’t use them in the expo hall, and any lineup for a panel will let you sit on the carpeted floor for most of the time.

Hopefully this is useful for folks, and as always, if y’all have any suggestions of your own- lay ‘em on me!",4,1744035478.0,PAX,7,0.7,False

Right now I’m in a really tough spot and could use advice - especially from those who’ve dealt with freelance struggles, client transitions, or career pivots in motion design.

I’ve been working with one client this whole time. It started okay, but over time I realized:

* I’m being seriously underpaid (€400/month for full-time involvement)
* My work is treated as disposable
* And month by month, I feel more drained and less like I’m growing

Because of the constant pressure and lack of appreciation, I’ve started to feel completely burned out.  
Some days it’s hard to even sit down and start — the energy’s just gone.  
At one point I felt like I was losing touch with myself.

At the same time, I need to completely change my life and leave my country within the next few months.  
This is not optional - I simply don’t have the luxury of staying.

But I also can’t leave without some kind of stable income. And here’s the dilemma:

* If I quit the client to build a proper portfolio - I might not find new work fast enough
* If I stay with the client - I’ll have almost no time or energy left to move forward, and my situation keeps getting worse

My current portfolio doesn’t reflect the kind of work I want to do or the level I’m aiming for.  
If I had the time, I could build a new reel with fake/personal projects - and I’m confident I could grow fast.

But this feels like a leap into the unknown.  
And for the first time in my life, it’s not just about a “job change.”  
It’s a move that could decide everything about my future.

I’m not looking for sympathy.  
I’m just asking for perspective and advice from those who know the industry:

What would you do in this situation?  
Would you take the risk and leave to grow?  
Or stay and hold onto minimal stability, while putting your growth on hold?

My fiancé's (42m) parents paid for the venue as this is his first marriage while it my second. My in laws are also paying for the rehearsal dinner. I'm beyond grateful that they are so willing to pay for the most expensive part of the wedding. We have a small bridal party and for the rehearsal dinner, we decided to invite my aunt and her wife, who I'm incredibly close to, my cousin who is coming from another country and his godmother and uncle. We wanted to keep the dinner small and feel that only the bridal party and our special guest should attend. 

During the planning process, my dad asked me to invite his cousin and cousins wife since he doesn't have a lot of family members he's on speaking terms with. Since we were trying to keep the guest under 150, I accommodated my dads request by removing people from the list. When cousin said he was coming and going to stay at my parents house, my mom insisted that they be included for the rehearsal dinner and that they were willing to pay for their dinner. She thinks that since cousin is staying at her house that she would be a bad host and feels like it would be rude if they went to dinner and cousin and his wife were left out. Cousin is driving in so they have their own transport if they want to leave the house. She stated she will skip the dinner if they aren't invited. 

For context, when my sister got married, my mom showed up with extra an guest to the rehearsal dinner without telling anyone until they arrived. She told my sisters in-laws that she would pay for their dinner but the in-laws were gracious and covered their meal as well. We all felt it was incredibly rude and my sister was livid. I told my mom that she better not pull this same shit for my rehearsal dinner because I will be that bitch and ask them to leave. I asked her not to put me in that position. I even phoned my MIL and told her that if my mom calls her to let her know I've already said no. 

Well over the weekend, my dad decided to ask me again if his cousin and the wife could be included at the rehearsal dinner. He asked me as a favor for him because he feels bad that they would be left behind while we were having dinner. He stated that if they aren't included, he wouldn't be able to attend the dinner. I know my mom told him to ask me and to try and guilt trip me so she can have her way. I told dad I would think about it. 

It really bothered me and I felt it was unfair that both he and my mom were trying to guilt trip me into getting their way. I talked it over with my fiance and my sister, where I expressed my feelings and they both agreed that my parents were being unfair. My fiance said he would support whatever decision I make and if I want to keep the peace with my parents, he understood. 

My sister on the other hand, let my parents know that they are being unfair and they shouldnt guilt trip me just so they can get their way. She reminded them that I wanted to keep things small and not every out of town guest needs to be invited. She went clean off on them and told me all about it. She said my dad kept coming up with excuses and she shut that shit down reminding them that they aren't paying for this wedding. 

Yesterday while having coffee with my dad, he asked if I thought about it. I said that I did and told him how I felt about the entire situation. I told him that he and mom put me in a difficult position and it's unfair. That he and mom stating they wouldn't go to the rehearsal dinner because their house guests werent invited hurt my feeling and made me feel like I'm less important than their guests. I told my dad that the answer is no and that if they don't come to the dinner, I would be incredibly upset and it would tell me exactly where I stand with them. As their daughter, they should be there to support me as well as respect my decision. I also reminded him that we made cuts to invite his cousin. My dad just shrugged and said ok. 

While I'm comfortable with my decision, I wonder if I'm the asshole in this situation. My fiance says no and that I have been very reasonable and firm about the whole thing. But I can't help feeling like I am. I love my parents, especially my dad since we have a great bond. I hate for him to think I'm being the asshole here.
