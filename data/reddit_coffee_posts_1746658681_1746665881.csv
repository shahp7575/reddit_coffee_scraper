I've tried roasting a few decafs, and every SWP/MWP coffee has had a distinct ""decaf"" flavor - I'm not sure how to describe it, but kind of like stale whole grain bread.  Sometimes the beans even smell like this coming out of the roaster.  I tried one EA decaf and it didn't have this flavor, but most green options I see are WP.  If you know what I'm talking about, is this due to improper roasting or is it a property of the beans that can't be roasted out?  If the latter, have you found any WP decafs that don't have this flavor?  Or how should I be roasting to get rid of it?  I usually roast decaf more slowly than regular, based on what I've read, but not sure what else I could be doing to optimize.  Thanks!",1,1746665279.0,roasting,0,1.0,False
1khdf07,https://www.reddit.com/r/GallberryCountyTales/comments/1khdf07/the_song_beneath_black_dog_bridge/,The Song Beneath Black Dog Bridge,"Gallberry County keeps its own kind of silence. It isn‚Äôt the hush you find in empty churches or the wide-eyed quiet before a hurricane rolls ashore. It‚Äôs the silence of things left buried‚Äîroots and deeds alike‚Äîhumming just below human hearing. I‚Äôd been gone eight years, but the moment my tires bumped off Highway 84 onto the red-clay washboard of Possum Fork Road, that hush rose to meet me like breath on the back of my neck.

Hank Ryles disappeared under this same hush the spring I left for Mobile. One minute he was straddling the guardrail on Black Dog Bridge, crowing about how the Gallberry Light was nothing but swamp gas and Yankee imagination; the next, he was gone, carried into the treeline by something we never quite saw. Sheriff Sutton called it a drowning‚Äîthough Hank‚Äôs boots turned up thirty yards inland hanging, knotted together, from a pine limb shaped like a question mark.

I told myself I‚Äôd come home to sell Mama‚Äôs house, but I parked beside the bridge long past dusk, motor clicking, because unfinished stories won‚Äôt stay sold. Kudzu draped the rusted railings like a funeral pall. The creek below wheezed through cattails, swollen from June rains. Bullfrogs stopped croaking as I stepped out, and the hush swelled, thick as syrup.

A lone porch light burned half a mile away at Miss Loretta Thaggard‚Äôs place. Folks call her the Kudzu Whisperer‚Äîswears the vines carry messages. I wondered what mine would say if it could talk.

‚ÄúThought I‚Äôd find you nosin‚Äô around here.‚Äù Sheriff Sutton‚Äôs voice scraped out of the dark. His cruiser idled behind my truck, headlights pinning me like a moth. Sutton looked older: gray wattles at his neck, badge dulled with fingerprints nobody dared wipe. ‚ÄúGrave-robbers and prodigals always circle back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just sightseeing.‚Äù

‚ÄúSight‚Äôs gone bad out here,‚Äù Sutton said. ‚ÄúRoad‚Äôll wash out come morning. Best head on.‚Äù

He waited until I drove off before turning his lights around. In the mirror I saw him kill the beams but leave the engine running, as though he, too, had business with the dark.


Mama‚Äôs house smelled of cedar chests and stale hymnals. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Around two a.m. the hush cracked open‚Äîthin, fluting whistles carried on the wind, a half-remembered lullaby. I followed it barefoot past the barn, through gallberry thickets beaded with dew, until I reached the old turpentine still where Hank and I used to light cigarettes and carve our initials.

Light shimmered under the rotted floorboards, pulsing like a lantern beneath black water. For one crazed second I thought Hank would rise through the planks, grin full of sawdust, and ask why I‚Äôd taken so long. Instead a whisper threaded the kudzu leaves: Isaiah‚Ä¶ Isaiah‚Ä¶

Mama always said my name carried prophecy. I‚Äôd never wanted to know what kind.

My foot slid on something slick. I looked down: a sheriff‚Äôs star, silver points bent, chain snapped. I pocketed it before the hush could close over the evidence.


Next morning I took a drive. Miss Loretta sat on the porch shelling butter beans, radio muttering gospel beside her. She didn‚Äôt lift her eyes when I approached.

‚ÄúKudzu been singin‚Äô to you,‚Äù she said.

I eased onto the top step. ‚ÄúYou know what it wants?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wants memory. County‚Äôs starved for it. People forget, place remembers, and the gap‚Äôs gotta be stuffed somehow.‚Äù She flicked a husk into a chipped bowl. ‚ÄúYour daddy, Hank‚Äôs folks, Sheriff Sutton‚Äîthey tried to feed it lies. Land‚Äôs still hungry.‚Äù

I showed her the battered badge. ‚ÄúYou think Sutton‚Äôs still feeding it?‚Äù

Loretta‚Äôs gaze met mine‚Äîold, bright, unblinking. ‚ÄúQuestion is what he‚Äôs fattenin‚Äô up to give next.‚Äù


I waited for night. At eleven-thirty clouds smothered the moon and Possum Fork Road vanished in a fog of moths. I parked at the bridge and cut the lights. Kudzu leaves fluttered, though no breeze stirred. Their shapes seemed to spell my name.

Under the bridge, the creek glowed faintly‚Äîas if moonlight seeped from the mud instead of the sky. I climbed down, flashlight off, following the inner flicker. Water sucked at my boots. Beneath the central span lay a sheet-metal hatch, newly welded and still smelling of burnt iron. Its padlock was fresh. On top rested a Mason jar filled with red earth and rusty nails, stoppered by wax and etched with a faint sigil.

The hush pressed so hard my ears rang. Still I heard the crunch of gravel above‚Äîfootsteps, deliberate. A beam sliced through the slats, catching my shoulders.

‚ÄúIsaiah Ward,‚Äù Sutton called, voice steady. ‚ÄúStep away.‚Äù

I set the jar on a mossy rock. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in the locker, Sheriff?‚Äù

‚ÄúHistory,‚Äù he said, descending with revolver drawn. ‚ÄúWhich only burdens folks who tote it wrong.‚Äù

A tremor rolled through the creek bed, rippling the water. Light leaked from the jar‚Äîpale as bone-fire‚Äîspooling upward to lay stripes across Sutton‚Äôs face. His eyes filmed white.

‚ÄúWe gave it trespassers first,‚Äù he said distantly, as if reciting scripture. ‚ÄúBootleggers, runaways, the desperate. County slept easy. But hunger hollers louder each decade.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou gave it Hank.‚Äù

His jaw clenched; maybe memory hurt him, too. ‚ÄúSome folks are born already fading. They leave less trace.‚Äù

I stepped back. ‚ÄúAnd me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou came back. That‚Äôs trace enough.‚Äù

I kicked the jar. Wax shattered, soil spilling into the creekbed. A wind howled up through the hatch, stinking of iron and rot. Kudzu vines snaked from the waterline, wrapping Sutton‚Äôs ankles. He fired twice‚Äîmuzzle flashes swallowed by the dark‚Äîbefore the vines yanked him to his knees.

The badge I‚Äôd pocketed flared with heat, searing through my pocket. I hurled it into the creek. It hissed like fat on a griddle.

Sutton‚Äôs scream cut off as the vines dragged him through the hatch. The door slammed shut. The padlock clicked into place on its own.

Silence flooded back, thicker than before.

The water cleared. Something floated up: Hank‚Äôs cap, mud-stained but intact. Inside lay my pocketknife‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd lost years ago, initials carved over a heart I never finished. Guilt twisted inside me. I‚Äôd left Hank that night, chasing a scholarship and a life beyond pine-pitch shadows. He‚Äôd laughed me off the bridge then, said Gallberry would keep him company. It had.

I climbed out at dawn, cap and knife tucked close. Kudzu already blanketed Sutton‚Äôs cruiser, vines threading the wheel wells like veins. No sign of him but muddy boot prints leading nowhere.


The county woke slow: cicadas tuning up, diesel tractors coughing in distant fields. At the crossroads, Miss Loretta waved me over. She pressed a paper sack into my hands‚Äîcornbread, a thermos of chicory coffee, and a coil of vine no bigger than a bracelet.

‚ÄúWear that when the hush gets too loud,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúReminds the land you‚Äôre listening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happens now?‚Äù

Loretta glanced toward the pines, where fog unraveled like parchment. ‚ÄúGallberry‚Äôs full‚Äîfor a spell. Keep your stories true and your silences honest. That‚Äôs how you keep it from getting hungry again.‚Äù

I drove east, sunlight flickering through longleaf branches, thinking of hollows‚Äîtrees, men, counties‚Äîand how easily they fill with whatever light we leave behind. In the mirror a green wave crawled over the road, vines swallowing skid marks, secrets, and freshly turned memories. The hush followed, patient as hunger, waiting for the next forgetting.",1,1746665188.0,GallberryCountyTales,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 387: Somewhere In A Dream**

  
The heart of the Ivywood welcomed Marina with a slap to her face.

It was followed by a sucker punch to her gut and then a sweep of her legs.

There was no frantic windmilling of her arms as she snapped into existence. That level of indignity wasn't available to her. Instead, it was a force which sent her spiralling in all directions like a drunkard in search of the nearest keg.

The reason was clear.

Magic.

There was magic everywhere.

It was total. Pervasive. She could taste it on her tongue. It was bitter, pleasant, acrid, vile, savoury, overpowering and mild. All the sensations which could be experienced over the course of a productive evening in her workshop had been condensed into a single moment. And the result was one added taste.

Flowery ‚Ä¶ perhaps slightly nutty.

After all‚Äî

‚ÄúUnnnnnngggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\~‚Äù

That was what the local pollen tasted like.

Marina hugged her stomach as she knelt, all the while smothering her face with a bundle of grass.

It was familiar. Mercifully so. A scent she could anchor onto, helping to stop the spinning of her head as she slowly willed her soul to return to her body.

She waited, doing nothing but futilely fighting away the extreme nausea.

Then, she caught a glimpse of something bright in the corner of her eye.

A fruit slime.

Small, red and round ‚Ä¶ just like the apples they slowly absorbed.

And it was bouncing towards her.

Utter despair filled Marina's heart.

She'd come so close.¬†

She was mere steps, mere moments away from unravelling the reasons for her existence. Her purpose. Her blood. To unravel the mystery behind the missing witches and her mother.

And now she'd suffer defeat to a single poke.

She knew it with utmost certainty.

Like the moment after consuming far too much food over the course of a single meal just because Mrs. Tinnaman at The Black Fowl wanted to repay her for the knee ointment by using anything but crowns, she knew that just the faintest contact to her waist would destroy her.

Horror consumed Marina as she watched the lowliest of monsters approach.

She tried to shake her head as it happily bounced towards her. *Bounce. Bounce. Bounce*. Each motion like the pendulum of doom striking midnight. It only made her more desperate as a vision of the future flashed across her mind.

A tombstone where she lay.

Marina Lainsfont.

Witch of Calamity.

Defeated by a fruit slime.

‚ÄúNnnghhhhh ‚Ä¶ nooooooo ...‚Äù

She clenched her teeth.

She clenched her fists.

She clenched her arms, shoulders and legs, the sheer weight of indignity taking hold of her quivering muscles as she forced herself to sit up.

And then she gasped.

Once. Twice. Three times. Until her vision began to sharpen and she could focus on more than just whatever was the brightest colour in her periphery. A haze of green washed over her. More grass. Shrubs. Trees adorned with so many leaves that their branches were weighed down like sheep desperately in need of a shear.

With an effort she'd never expended before, a smidgeon of balance returned.

And thus‚Äî

‚ÄúShoo ‚Ä¶ shoo ‚Ä¶‚Äù

She waved away the bringer of her demise.

The fruit slime paused ‚Ä¶ and then it bounced away, either sensing its prey recovering or simply suspecting that nothing in Marina's alchemy satchel was flavourful.

If the latter, then it was correct.

Everything she made tasted like medicine. Even if less than half the things she carried actually were. She dug into her satchel and retrieved one of the better ones, then uncorked it and drank.

Relief flooded her at once, courtesy of a revitalising potion imbued with her favourite coffee extract. She stood up a moment later and took a deep breath, sucking in the air like a dragon readying to see the forest burn.

A prospect Marina couldn't rule out.

Something had pulled ‚Ä¶ no, dragged her here.

Her arrival had been disturbed. A concern. That was no simple teleportation spell she'd used. It was a fixed anchor designed by a fae countess. And yet she'd been fished out like a salmon hooked from a river.

The interruption combined with the glut of magic in the air would have been enough to see any other mage succumb to the first caterpillar to crawl over them. Because this wasn't just the Ivywood.

This was a settlement.

Marina narrowed her eyes as she gaze around her.

She caught the homes scattered beneath the ancient branches.¬†

But these certainly weren't the fluttering pavilions of elves in a forest. They were wooden, old, covered in moss ‚Ä¶ and also resembled the highly approximate shape of teapots, their tips functioning as chimneys and lids as rooftops.

The home of the Hexenkreis Clan.

She'd arrived. But far from rejoicing, Marina could only furrow her brows. And not only because the same barrier she'd intended to cross had drawn her inside instead.

Something was very wrong here.

Despite the fruit slime bouncing away, a clear sombreness pervaded the air. The same as could be found in the midst of a graveyard.

The reason was soon clear.

Not a single sound was being emitted.

There was no brush of leaves or cry of birdsong, despite the presence of sparrows overhead and the swaying of branches.

All Marina heard instead was another intake of breath ‚Ä¶ followed shortly by the padding of her steps as she made her way towards the nearest giant teapot.

It wasn't long until she found her first witch.

Beside a flattened trail dotted with sunflowers, a woman was watering a patch of roses growing between the oaks. She wore no telltale hat or formal robes, but an airy dress reminding Marina of a time where wearing a cloak and hood was no longer an occupational requirement.

Even so, there was no doubt as to who she was.

The roses were being watered using a wand.

A crux favoured by apprentices. And also witches who favoured the oldest traditions of inefficiency.¬†

A stream of liquid poured forth from the end. But despite sparkling beneath the sunlight, it failed to connect with the flowers.

The flowing water was utterly still ‚Ä¶ as was the witch directing it.

Marina cautiously circled the motionless figure, taking in a sight even she'd never witnessed before.¬†

There were spells of paralysis which could mirror such complete lack of movement. This was clearly more than that. Even her magic had been affected.

Time had ceased to move for this witch.

‚Äú\[Sacred Dispel\].‚Äù

A faint glow shortly engulfed the woman as Marina's spell weaved around her.

No reaction.

Marina nodded in acknowledgement. Any magic which altered the perception of time was amongst the most advanced. But a spell so potent it could wholly sever somebody from the strands of time was almost unheard of.

An impressive feat. Particularly as this witch wasn't the only subject.

Marina proceeded onwards, following the sunflower trail as more of the village's residents made themselves known. Some were caught mid-stride. Some were locked in conversation. But all were as oblivious to their plight as they were to Marina's presence.

There was no hint of horror upon their faces, or a counterspell exiting their lips.

Whatever this was, it had come with neither warning nor delay.

Eventually, Marina walked until something almost resembling a street appeared. The teapot homes sat side by side as wooden fences now formally marked the trail. Except it was more than sunflowers which began to litter the ground.

Childish drawings of sunshine and families.¬†

Musical instruments both large and small.¬†

Colourful books bearing the titles of famed fairytales.¬†

Dolls smiling in eternal joy.

Objects were scattered amidst the feet of the frozen witches. Each was another question before she'd received a single answer. Yet as she reached the end of the impromptu street, she discovered only the greatest riddle thus far.

Why, amidst a village lost in time‚Äî

‚ÄúWould you like some more tea, Mr. Butterscotch? Miss Riririn says it's very good. It pairs most nicely with the carrot cake. But if you wait one moment, I think that Lady Clover says that the hot cross buns will soon be ready.‚Äù

‚Äîwas there a little girl having a picnic in a garden?

Large shining eyes. A blue dress. A circlet of daisies upon her golden hair.

Beneath the shade of the oldest and most gnarled oak tree yet, a child with a sweet and innocent appearance smiled away as she sat upon a blanket amidst swaying grass and wildflowers.

Her company was a stuffed bear, a stuffed rabbit and a stuffed dog‚Äîeach being dutifully attended to with the teapot she held in both hands.

It was clearly too unwieldy for her, but if there was any awkwardness in the weight, her smile didn't betray it. She poured into the waiting cups, each paired with either a plate of carrot cake or a rectangular sandwich.

Marina paused.

All of a sudden, hesitancy washed over her.

It was an emotion she rarely indulged in. Children were not her forte. The few who entered her shop were more likely to wreck it than convince their parents to buy the sweets nobody ever did. Despite them being excellent.

However, Marina already knew she wouldn't need her shopkeeper persona for this.

Not when it was clear what the source of the temporal stasis around her was.

The little girl was making no attempt to hide it. Likely because she couldn't.

Marina could see the magic exuding from her. A strand for every witch, each a fine trail before vanishing into the air.

It was unnerving. Unsettling. Because being a child prodigy herself, Marina knew more than any other that even the most gifted of mages had limits.

Although she could frighten away a fruit slime from her kitchen window, locking away so many mages from the present was something she could never have achieved. At least deliberately.

Even so, she pushed her doubts to one side and approached, then found herself peering down at a picnic gathering.

‚Äú... Are you responsible for this?‚Äù she asked without preamble.

The little girl continued pouring her tea.

‚ÄúLook, Mr. Butterscotch. The Witch of Calamity wants to ask us a question. And she doesn't even sit down to introduce herself first. How can we answer her when she won't even show the littlest of manners?‚Äù

Marina creased her brows.

The fae were one thing. But a child was quite another.

‚ÄúYou know who I am already. But I don't know who you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm the hostess of this tea party. And if you'd like to join us in conversation, you'll need to sit down and introduce yourself. I might know you, but Mr. Butterscotch, Miss Riririn and Lady Clover do not.‚Äù

The little girl pointed at the dog, the bear and the rabbit in turn.

Marina ignored them all.

‚ÄúI'm not here for a tea party. I'm here for the witches. Do you know why they're now standing frozen in time?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't. But then again, they're hardly frozen in time.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey're not moving.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo you, maybe. But to me, I see them stretching, reaching and laughing. Just very slowly. Oh so slowly. It'd be most terrible if they actually were frozen. It'd mean they're also stuck with the same thought as well. Can you imagine how awful that'd be? Mrs. Rancel thought she'd left her door unlocked. You can see her turning in panic. I think that sort of anxiety shouldn't be suffered forever. Just a few centuries is enough.‚Äù

The little girl nodded towards a nearby witch.

A glance was enough to confirm the expression of dread stuck to her face. The cruelty of mages old and young rarely moved Marina's heart. But even this seemed excessive.

‚ÄúI see. Not a true time stop, then. Just something an inch less powerful.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's just mean. My spell is much closer than an inch. It's at least a crumb as close to the real thing. Would you like me to show you how it's done?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't. The results I see are more than enough. As talented as I am, this is magic beyond me. And I imagine that it's also beyond‚Äî‚Äù

Click.

The little girl snapped her fingers.

All of a sudden, Marina's words caught in her throat.

Her eyes widened as she stilled. And the only sound was the echo of an improbable spell somehow reverberating in the open air.

She blinked.

Then ‚Ä¶ she slowly reached up and patted her cheeks.

‚ÄúEheheheheheh\~‚Äù

A round of giggling met her at once.

‚ÄúDid you see that, everyone? The silly Witch of Calamity is scared when she has no reason to be! After all, we've so much to talk about. And so many snacks to share. Will you sit down with us now? We can even become friends.‚Äù

Marina wrinkled her nose ‚Ä¶ mostly at her own momentary concern.

Whatever powers this child-shaped enigma boasted, there was a limit. And it would stop at the first mage who didn't need to a wand to employ magic.

‚ÄúI am not here for a picnic,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIs that because of the carrot cake? ‚Ä¶ In that case, we've hot cross buns as well. Lady Clover says they're just ready. There's marmalade as well. My favourite combination. We can eat while I answer all the wonderful questions which brought you here. Isn't there lots you want to ask me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I suppose there is is.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood! Now, was it the carrot cake or the‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBut anything you can answer, so can the adults.‚Äù Marina raised a fingertip, now certain no defences were in place. ‚Äú\[Disjunction\].‚Äù

Her spell struck the little girl in the chest.

The magic altering the perception of time couldn't be easily dispelled. But it could be disrupted. To actively manage such a wide-area effect was a monumental feat. But the greater the burden, the weaker the supports.

Marina waited ‚Ä¶ and then she continued to wait.

Especially as only movement came from the little girl.

‚ÄúDid you see that, everyone?‚Äù she said, her hands clapping together to a smile. ‚ÄúThe Witch of Calamity doesn't just want to talk. She wants to play. In that case ‚Ä¶ who wants to go first? Mr. Butterscotch, perhaps?‚Äù

Marina glanced in puzzlement at the nearest witch.

A specialised interruption spell had made direct impact upon an active casting source with no barriers, runes or wards to act as mitigation. Even so, the magic which seeped from the little girl still bound itself to them without even the slightest ripple.

A defiance of both common logic and magical theory. And so she could only click her tongue as she considered the benefits of using her shopkeeper voice instead.

All the more so since Mr. Butterscotch suddenly began to grow bigger.

Much bigger.

Enough that as the seams began to break and muscles, flesh, fangs and literal hellfire replaced cotton, Marina came to an important conclusion.

From now on, she would ban all children from her shop.

My life is a mess right now. I've been unemployed for years. Living at home with my mom and brother who I don't really have a relationship with. I'm 26 days sober after everyday drug use that lasted months and ended up with me in hospital. 

I'm supposed to pick up my social welfare and prescription meds this week and I can't leave the house because I'm incredibly anxious. I'm really afraid of people. I feel like when I'm out in public everyone can see what a failure I am. They can see my fear and shame. I know and understand that this is crazy but I stay inside anyway. 

My childhood was great until suddenly it got flipped upside down.

I grew up with my mom dad and brother and things were normal until I was about 10 years old. My dad never came home and my mom said no one knew where he was and people were out looking for him.

I would find out later that he had tried to kill himself via pill overdose after parking his car in a secluded area. 

He was sent to a psych facility for a few months and while he was there I found his phone in a drawer at home and read text messages confessing what he had attempted that day. 

When he eventually came back home things never got better. He was in such a bad depression that I don't remember seeing him out of his bed. This was a man that was an amazing father. A big loud man who made his kids laugh and feel protected. He tried to explain to me that he had a sickness that made him unable to be happy and I felt so sad for him and just couldn't understand how this could happen.

My mom and dads relationship became very strained and he began sleeping in a different room. I witnessed a lot of abuse towards my dad from my mom including her throwing a hot cup of coffee in his face while he was in bed and I was sitting next to him. That was horrible and I felt so sad for him. He looked so defeated.

Eventually my mom kicked him out. I didn't see him very much after that.

I remember coming home from school one day and the house was a mess, not completely trashed but things were smashed on the ground. 

I went into my dad's old room and his bed was soaked in blood. I remember how black in colour it was from how saturated the sheets and mattress were. My mom grabbed me and brought me out of the room and closed the door. She told me it was wine but I knew what wine smelled like and that room did not smell like wine. I was really scared and confused and couldn't understand how this could happen.

I remember we went to stay at a family members for a while. Probably for my mom to get away for a bit, but I just wanted to be back home. My mom let me speak to my dad on the phone in private and he broke down to me and told me that he just wanted to die. That he came home and slashed his wrists in his bed and that he just wanted to die so badly. I remember being really scared and just crying and not knowing what to say and he hung up the phone. I wiped my eyes and gave the phone back to my mom and pretended everything was okay, I did that a lot, pretend everything is okay and just block all the shit that was happening out of my mind.

I didn't see much of my dad after that. He was staying at a house by himself and we went to spend the weekend once and he was just a completely different person, had lost an extreme amount of weight and didn't speak much, didn't try make me laugh anymore. It was horrible.

When I was 12 I was in school about to start class and my phone vibrated. It was a text from my dad that just said ""Bye""

That day was a blur. I remember being picked up from school and my mom said I had to go to my friend's house for a bit. I never asked any questions and just played along pretending everything was okay even though I knew what had happened but my brain absolutely couldn't accept it. I was so dissociated. 

When I eventually got home my dad's sisters were there and my mom sat me and my brother down in front of everyone and told us that our dad was found dead. He'd hung himself in the garage.

I never cried. I remember feeling completely numb and staring into space for the longest time. It felt like I was watching from a 3rd person view at my aunt's and brother crying. It was too much for my brain.

Things were really hard after that. It hit my mom hard and triggered her menopause and she was a nightmare to be around. She became a very angry person and I was scared of her.

I began getting into trouble in school and began smoking weed. My mom eventually found out and I was in a lot of trouble. But I never stopped, in fact I began smoking more and became more reckless with it and got caught by my mom again and she kicked me out of the house. I stayed with a friend until she allowed me to come home. I still didn't stop, I began drinking alcohol too and started taking cocaine and ecstasy. 

My mental health began to go downhill quickly. I would get panic attacks and felt so depressed. I didn't find joy in anything and lost interest in everything. But I just kept getting high.

When I was 16 I dropped out of school because my mental health was so bad and I had fallen so behind. I got a job at an organic farm and I really enjoyed working with plants and learning how to grow food. But I was spending all my wages on drugs. I eventually quit working and stayed on a bad path, getting jobs but not being able to hold them down.

When I was 21 I began to slow down on drug use and tried to move forward. Hiking and camping, therapy, traveling. And I've had periods of sobriety but it always collapsed and I turn back to drugs.

I'm struggling lately but I want to turn my life around so badly. I meet with an addiction counselor next week and I want to go to rehab. I'm 26 days sober which is great but I'm struggling with so much anxiety, shame and guilt.

It's late and I'm getting super tired so I'm gonna finish this post here. It's a long one. Thanks for reading if you've made it this far.

The room around them hummed with warmth ‚Äî a quiet, late-night intimacy, golden from the lamp in the corner. Reggae still played softly, its rhythm slow and sure, as if it had all the time in the world. Candy curled into the far corner of the couch, bare feet tucked beneath her, one hand loosely holding a full glass, untouched for the last several minutes. Her eyes stayed on him.

He didn‚Äôt wait for an opening.

‚ÄúI was married,‚Äù he said. His voice was level. ‚ÄúSeven years.‚Äù

Candy didn‚Äôt react right away. Just the slight lift of her brows. An invitation, not a judgment.

‚ÄúWe built a real life. One of those lives with rhythms to it ‚Äî who took out the trash, who made coffee first, how laundry got folded. Not flashy. Not fragile. It felt solid. Like it would hold.‚Äù

He leaned back slightly, jaw tightening before releasing.

‚ÄúThen she got into a car accident. It changed her. Physically, she recovered. But inside‚Ä¶ she was somewhere else. Somewhere I couldn‚Äôt reach. And not long after that, we found out she couldn‚Äôt have children. That broke something open between us. Or maybe it had already cracked, and that news just split it wide.‚Äù

Candy stayed still. Her face soft, unafraid of his details.

‚ÄúShe started to sink. I tried to keep her above water. Rehab, therapy, holistic stuff. I was throwing everything I had at it. Three times I checked her in. Told myself love was supposed to hurt sometimes, supposed to require everything. I didn‚Äôt hesitate ‚Äî paid every bill, signed every form. She was my wife. I showed up.‚Äù

He exhaled through his nose, gaze fixed on the middle distance.

‚ÄúThird stay changed her. After she came back, she started to tell me she was going out with her friends on the weekends. I support that, getting her back in touch with people who loved her. And I trusted her for months. One night, she said she‚Äôd dropped her phone in a puddle one night out. I offered to fix it ‚Äî I have an IT background, figured I could recover the data. Took it in, dried it out, transferred what I could.

That‚Äôs when I saw them. Dozens of photos. Her and him. Arms around each other, grinning at diners, parks, places I‚Äôd never been. The time stamps told the rest. He wasn‚Äôt new. He‚Äôd been there.

Eventually, she admitted it. Said he saw her clearly. Said I reminded her too much of who she used to be.‚Äù

Candy‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly, not with judgment ‚Äî with ache.

‚ÄúIt got ugly. She filed a restraining order. Had me arrested. Claimed I was threatening her. Took everything ‚Äî the house, the furniture, my dad‚Äôs old speakers, even the fucking cutlery.‚Äù

He rubbed a hand over his jaw.

‚ÄúShe got into my Porsche and ruined it. Over all the things she damaged and threw out, the judge ruled her to pay it all back to me. I replaced it, of course ‚Äî handled it like I handled everything else. Quietly. Thoroughly. I bought a new wardrobe too. Didn't want to wear anything that reminded me of the man who stayed too long in a story that no longer served him.‚Äù

The music shifted, slow and heavy. Still, neither of them moved.

‚ÄúJudge ruled in my favor. No charges. Record clean. But by then, the damage wasn‚Äôt legal. It was‚Ä¶ everything else. I lost my father during all of it. Pancreatic cancer. Fast and merciless. I held his hand in the hospital and drove back to an apartment with no bed frame.‚Äù

Candy looked at him for a long time. Her voice was low when it came.

‚ÄúWith all that happening... did you feel like God was punishing you?‚Äù

John let the question sit.

‚ÄúYeah. For a while, I did.‚Äù

She nodded. Then, quietly: ‚ÄúHow do you handle betrayal now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make promises I can‚Äôt keep,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I watch what people do when no one‚Äôs clapping. I trust slowly. Not because I‚Äôm scared ‚Äî because I know what it costs when you get it wrong.‚Äù

The silence wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable. It was full. Whole.

‚ÄúI work three IT jobs now. I'm stacking every dollar with intention. I want to retire early. Not to flex. Just to live. To feel like my time belongs to me again.‚Äù

Candy looked down at her glass, then his.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The milk chocolate ice cubes present an innovative approach to enhancing beverage experiences.

**Composition and Ingredients:** These ice cubes are crafted from premium milk chocolate, typically containing cocoa solids, milk solids, sugar, and sometimes added flavorings such as vanilla or malt. The quality of the chocolate directly impacts the taste and melting behavior of the cube, with higher cocoa butter content contributing to a smoother melt and richer flavor. Manufacturers often emphasize the use of ethically sourced cocoa beans and natural ingredients to cater to health-conscious consumers.

**Cube Size and Shape:** The dimensions of the ice cubes are designed for optimal melting rate and flavor infusion. Typical cubes range from 1-inch to 1.5-inches in size, allowing them to cool the beverage while releasing chocolate gradually. Variations in shape, such as spherical or patterned cubes, can enhance the visual appeal and alter the surface area exposed to the liquid, thereby affecting the melting speed and flavor intensity.

**Freezing and Stability:** The manufacturing process involves carefully controlling the cooling and hardening of the chocolate to ensure structural integrity during freezing and thawing. This prevents the cubes from crumbling or becoming brittle, maintaining their shape and texture until they are added to a drink. Stabilizers and emulsifiers, such as soy lecithin, may be incorporated to improve the chocolate's resistance to temperature fluctuations and prevent cocoa butter bloom.

**Packaging and Storage:** Milk chocolate ice cubes are generally packaged in airtight containers or resealable bags to prevent moisture absorption and flavor contamination. The packaging often includes instructions for proper storage, such as keeping the cubes in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or strong odors. Some brands offer eco-friendly packaging options to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.

Key features of the milk chocolate ice cubes include:

*   Premium milk chocolate composition
*   Optimized cube size and shape
*   Controlled freezing and stability
*   Protective packaging for storage

 ## Core Benefits

The use of milk chocolate ice cubes provide multiple distinct advantages.

**Enhanced Flavor Infusion:** The primary benefit of milk chocolate ice cubes is the consistent and controlled release of chocolate flavor into beverages. Unlike chocolate syrups that can be overly sweet or chocolate powders that may not fully dissolve, the ice cubes provide a gradual infusion of rich, balanced chocolate taste as they melt. This allows users to customize the intensity of the chocolate flavor by adjusting the number of cubes used, creating a personalized drinking experience.

**Convenience and Ease of Use:** Milk chocolate ice cubes offer unparalleled convenience compared to traditional methods of adding chocolate to drinks. They eliminate the need for measuring, stirring, or cleaning up sticky residues, making them ideal for quick and effortless preparation. Simply drop a few cubes into your favorite beverage, and they dissolve over time, transforming it into a delicious chocolate treat. This ease of use is particularly appealing for busy individuals, parents, and anyone seeking a hassle-free way to enjoy chocolate-infused drinks.

**Visual Appeal and Presentation:** The use of milk chocolate ice cubes elevates the aesthetic appeal of beverages, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication. The slow melting of the chocolate creates a visually appealing swirling effect, enhancing the overall drinking experience. The uniform shape and color of the cubes also contribute to a polished and professional presentation, making them suitable for serving guests or enjoying a special treat at home.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are answers to the most common questions consumers have about milk chocolate ice cubes.

**How long do milk chocolate ice cubes take to melt in a drink?**
  The melting time depends on several factors, including the temperature of the beverage, the size of the cubes, and the stirring frequency. Typically, a standard-sized cube will fully dissolve in a cold drink within 5-10 minutes. Warmer beverages will melt the cubes faster.

**Can milk chocolate ice cubes be used in hot beverages?**
  Yes, they are specifically designed to be used in both cold and hot drinks. In hot beverages like coffee or hot chocolate, the cubes will melt more quickly, creating a rich and flavorful drink. However, be aware that the beverage will cool down slightly as the cubes melt.

**Are milk chocolate ice cubes suitable for people with allergies or dietary restrictions?**
  This depends on the specific ingredients used by the manufacturer. Most milk chocolate ice cubes contain milk and soy lecithin. It's essential to carefully review the ingredient list and allergen information on the packaging before consumption, especially if you have allergies to milk, soy, or other common allergens. Some brands may offer dairy-free or vegan options.

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee-scented candles are more than just wax and fragrance; they represent an immersive sensory experience. It's essential to delve into the specific features that distinguish the superior products from the merely adequate.

**Scent Authenticity and Complexity:**

The hallmark of a great coffee-scented candle lies in its ability to accurately capture the nuances of a freshly brewed cup. A complex fragrance profile should incorporate not only the bold, roasted aroma of coffee beans but also subtle hints of chocolate, caramel, or even a touch of spice to create a truly captivating scent. The best candles in this category avoid simplistic, artificial coffee smells, instead striving for a realistic and multi-dimensional aroma that stimulates the senses and evokes the comfort of a cozy coffee shop. These candles use a blend of natural and synthetic fragrance oils, expertly combined to achieve the desired scent complexity and staying power.**Wax Composition and Burn Quality:**

The type of wax used in a candle considerably impacts its performance and overall quality. Soy wax, known for its clean burn and eco-friendly properties, is a popular choice for high-end candles. It burns more slowly and evenly than paraffin wax, minimizing soot and maximizing fragrance release. beeswax is another premium option, offering a natural, honey-like undertone that complements coffee scents beautifully. The best candles employ carefully selected wax blends, ensuring optimal fragrance diffusion, minimal residue, and a long, consistent burn time.A good quality wax will burn cleanly and evenly, avoiding tunneling or excessive smoking, and will last for the advertised burn time.

**Container Design and Material:**

The container holding the candle is more than just a vessel; it contributes to the overall aesthetic appeal of the product and can even influence its burn quality. Candles housed in high-quality glass or ceramic containers with thick walls tend to burn more evenly, as the thicker material helps to insulate the wax and prevent rapid temperature fluctuations. The design of the container is also crucial, with minimalist and elegant styles often preferred for their ability to seamlessly integrate into any d√©cor. Furthermore, the container's size and shape affect the candle's melt pool, influencing how efficiently the fragrance is released.

**Wick Type and Placement:**

The wick is the heart of any candle, and its type and placement significantly impact the burn quality, fragrance throw, and overall lifespan of the product. Cotton wicks, either braided or cored, are commonly used for their consistent and reliable burn. Wood wicks are becoming increasingly popular, offering a crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace, which adds to the ambiance. The number of wicks is also important, notably for larger candles, as multiple wicks help to create a more even melt pool and prevent tunneling. Careful wick trimming is essential for optimal performance and safety.

The longevity of the fragrance depends on various factors including wax type,fragrance concentration,environmental conditions,and proper burning practices. High-quality soy wax candles with a strong fragrance load typically maintain a noticeable scent for several hours, even after being extinguished.

Places we ate:
Cochon - We got the gator for an app and the brisket and catfish courtbuillion for meals. My husband wasn‚Äôt super thrilled with the brisket, but I loved my catfish and we both enjoyed the fried gator.

Verti Marte - this was my favorite meal hands down. Had my first muffuletta (warmed) and it was one of the best things I‚Äôve ever eaten. I‚Äôm afraid to try a muffuletta anywhere else because I will probably be disappointed.

Drago‚Äôs - we only had drinks and apps here. We got fried gator again and the chargrilled oysters. I would absolutely go back for those oysters again.

Ugly Dog BBQ - this was right near our hotel. I didn‚Äôt eat there but my husband did. He hated it so I don‚Äôt recommend. üòÇ He said everything he had was pretty bland. 

Tableau - we had brunch here overlooking Jackson Square. Blue crab fondue and the gulf fish sandwich were incredible. We made reservations but we didn‚Äôt really need them.. I was surprised we were the only ones there.

Parasol‚Äôs - we found this place while wandering around the Magazine St area. My husband loves a dive bar. We each got a po boy. I forget what he had but I got the firecracker shrimp po boy. It was good but not good enough for me to go back again. Don‚Äôt get their Irish coffee, there are much better places for that.

Favorite beignets were the praline ones at Loretta‚Äôs. I made sure to go back a second time. Also had beignets at The Vintage but I wasn‚Äôt as impressed. Our hotel had New Orleans Coffee and Beignet company inside. Their beignet bites were pretty good.


Now on to breweries:
We hit quite a few. Our first night we stopped at Courtyard. Interesting vibe. I enjoyed the Mexican beer. I am big on sours but they didn‚Äôt have any when we went.

We also did the Tchoup run - started at NOLA Brewing. I really enjoyed their pizza and their sours, they had several on tap. Miel was probably my favorite, they had a good variety and I just liked the vibe the best. Try the pickle habanero beer! It was delicious. Last stop on the run was Abita. 

While on Frenchmen St we saw a sign for Brieux Carre. We walked in and were surprised how small it was, but they do have a bigger area out back to sit. Beer was fine, I didn‚Äôt have anything that blew me away.


Other:
We did have some fun on Bourbon St. I got an Irish coffee at Erin Rose which was delicious (Mollys on Decatur was very good too). We also stopped at Tickler‚Äôs piano bar and that was a lot of fun. 

Also enjoyed wandering both Frenchman and Magazine St. Frenchman you can walk in anywhere and there will be jazz music. Magazine had a bunch of cute shops with unique clothing, souvenirs, etc.

We visited both the zoo and the aquarium. We enjoyed both, we are animal people. It was pretty hot out though so many of the animals chose to be indoors.

We also visited the WWII museum. It was a 5 minute walk from our hotel. This museum is incredible and so well done. It is definitely a 2 day thing. We didn‚Äôt realize how big it was. I had to leave after a couple of hours.. it just got to be too heavy for me. Hopefully we can finish it next time we visit.


Getting around:
We mostly walked everywhere. We used the blue bikes once. There just weren‚Äôt many around. Maybe because it was during jazz fest?

The Le Pass app was super easy to use and had real time updates on where the buses and street cars were. We were pleasantly surprised, especially coming from an area with the worst public transportation system ever (Boston).

1khcusk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khcusk,Poor Marco,"He has had a rough, traumatic couple of days.

He was born in the crawl space of a long abandoned house next door(ish. There‚Äôs an empty lot between me and house.) I‚Äôve been watching him, his brother Baby Blue Eyes, and his sister, aptly named Sissy, since they were little kittens toddling about since last November. Of the three, he‚Äôs the friendliest, boldest, and loudest (he‚Äôs very chatty and accepting of pets.)

When the crew arrived Monday morning to tear the house down, I hoped they all ran to new safety, scattered from the noise. Even if I never saw them again, I wanted them all to be safe.

At the end of the work day, with half the house collapsed, he appeared in its front yard & blitzed towards the other corner to see his brother & mom. Sissy was nowhere to be seen.

He was filthy. I put out food & water further from that lot, trying to lure them a bit away from the destruction. During the night, I saw all of them from my kitchen window poke around the newly exposed interior of the house.

Tuesday morning I got up early, made coffee, and gathered up cat foot. I wanted to be as loud & obvious as possible, to try to distract them with a rare breakfast (I usually feed them once a day). But when I stepped outside, the backhoe started up again, and Marco bolted into the crawl space. I was mortified & horrified. Later that day, he reemerged even filthier than the night previous, frightened, skiddish, desperate, but overjoyed to see me (his meows were practically screams.)

I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs okay and injured (especially because a house came down on him two days in a row!) I want to try to take him in, and I think I have a friend who‚Äôd love to adopt him, but he‚Äôs bonded so tightly with his brother it would be unimaginably cruel. Even still, much like with his older brother, Darwin, who lives with me now, it should be his idea to come inside, not by me forcing it.

I think I just don‚Äôt like this DNA. I sampled Khamrah Qawah and¬†*almost*¬†liked it‚Äîan almost buttery sweetness up top was nice, but the dry down got too sickly and boozy. I don‚Äôt want to smell like coffee liqueur. Dukhan ups the spice, but it's almost \*too\* spicy and I get no smoke, and  it‚Äôs still got that same syrupy undertone. Too much.¬†**5/10**

**Hawas Fire**  
It‚Äôs a no from me. I¬†*love*¬†Hawas Ice and Hawas Black, but this one just doesn‚Äôt work. Smells leathery in a very synthetic way, and the mineral notes feel off, almost abrasive. Intense alcohol blast at first spray. Get almost no sweetness. Big dislike.¬†**4/10**

**Honor and Glory**  
Immediate love at first sniff, and the dry down is even better. I posted about it yesterday because I was so hyped. I‚Äôm usually not into gourmands, but this is something else‚Äîcreamy pineapple meets smoky sandalwood, with a perfectly balanced touch of turmeric spice. Creamy, woody, spicy‚Äîjust beautiful.¬†**9/10**

**Spectre Ghost**  
This one‚Äôs almost tied with Honor and Glory for me. Super well-blended‚Äîlemony vanilla meets woody spice, with a touch of smokiness. It reminds me of Cedrat Boise, but honestly, I think this smells¬†*better*, more mature and complex. Only flaw is that sometimes the woods lean into a faint rubbery note. Still, a great cooler-weather scent. Honor and Glory is a definite buy; this is a¬†*maybe*¬†buy when the temps drop.¬†**8/10**

**Afro Leather**  
I tried African Leather in a store once and¬†*loved*¬†it, especially the menthol note. This clone? No menthol. It mostly smells like a new car interior with some spices layered on top. Nothing offensive, but not something I‚Äôd reach for.¬†**6/10**

**Bentley for Men Absolute**  
Kind of smells like cedar planks in a sauna. Interesting at first with a gingery smokiness,‚Äîbut it turns into something very dry and austere, with a weird salty edge. Not unpleasant, just not for me.¬†**5/10**",1,1746663021.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

1khcjsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1khcjsa/i_think_its_about_to_happen/,I think it's about to happen.,"So I (40m) have been married to my wife (41f) for 6 years now. She is verbally and emotionally abusive toward me, and when I think back, she's actually a pretty awful person to anyone that tries to be her friend, but that's beside the point. She keeps threatening divorce during our fights, and I think I'm ready for it to happen at this point.

The verbal and emotional abuse isn't just words. She will deprive me of sleep by slamming things and stomping around the house at all hours of the night and morning, break dishes and pieces of the house, and almost hit me in the face with a flying stoneware dinner plate. We are quite literally down to two coffee mugs at the moment. Furthermore, she visibly enjoys my emotional anguish, as she starts smiling and joking at my expense when I start crying even one tear. Best case scenario, the abuse only stops when I start crying, and we make up then. I'm at the end of my figurative rope.

However, some complications that give me pause are:

- She is an immigrant (Philippines). She is a Chinese Filipina, (we live in America, I'm a U.S. citizen) and I'm still ""on the hook"" to support her for another 3-4 years if we divorce.

- She was sent to a mental care facility here in the states last year due to a schizophrenic episode where she resisted police arrest for 20 minutes. Would proof of this help?

- I have been funding her every financial whim, sometimes without my approval, including multiple businesses that crash and burn. She has been unemployed since 2020. I  could get proof of tens of thousands of dollars going to her account, and proof of these transactions putting us into crippling debt, almost defaulting on our mortgage multiple times, and almost having our vehicle repossessed.  Would this help me?

- She says she wants a no-contest divorce (legal in my state), but wants to include the condition that I pay her a monthly allowance and give her the house that she can't afford. I kinda want to say ""fuck that"".

- I think she should go back to the Philippines to be with her family, because I really and truly think she's mentally unfit to make it by herself in this country. I honestly wonder not *if* she might end up homeless, but how quickly she will be.


I love her more than I ever loved anyone, but she hurts me so often. How do I go about this absolute shitshow?

Then you‚Äôd describe yourself just a little, but not too obvious. Like, ‚ÄúI had a grey hoodie and a black backpack.‚Äù Just enough for the other person to maybe notice who you are.

If they saw it and liked you back, they could reply‚Äîand honestly, a lot of people ended up connecting that way. You‚Äôd keep checking to see if that person who kept looking at you might actually like you too. And yeah, most of the time‚Ä¶ they did.

I just wanted to hop on and document my inguinal/umbilical hernia experience. I‚Äôm currently writing this the day after my surgery, so I‚Äôll try to update it day by day.

A little back story for you all. I am a 23 year old male, 6‚Äô3, and 155 pounds. I‚Äôve heard that tall skinny people have a higher risk of hernias, not sure how true that is though. Anyways, I‚Äôve had an inguinal hernia on my right side for years, and really wasn‚Äôt worried about it (I‚Äôm also not sure how I got it either). I finally decided to get the surgery done, since I started feeling my hernia a bit more. There was never any pain, but it started getting a little uncomfortable at times.

Biting the bullet, I met with my primary care doctor back in September who confirmed it was an inguinal hernia. I put off my surgery consultation since I was going to be moving in February, and wanted to get settled in before having the surgery. So after the move was over, I had my consultation in April, where my surgeon also pointed out a small umbilical hernia (I thought I just had a funny looking belly button all my life).

The day of the surgery came, it was laparoscopic with mesh for my inguinal hernia, and my umbilical hernia just needed a single stitch. I came in at 5:30, with my surgery scheduled for 7:30. I don‚Äôt even remember the anesthesia hitting. I just remember being transferred to the surgery table, and then waking up in the recover room. I managed to pee, and was out of the medical center shortly after noon. 

Coming home seemed pretty straightforward. I kicked back, took a combo of Tylenol and ibuprofen, and relaxed. No major pain unless I sneezed, coughed, or laughed. This pretty much carried over to today, when I am currently writing this. Still pretty sore, but I accomplished a bowel movement after my morning cup of coffee, and tried to walk around a bit throughout the day. I noticed my swelling went up a bit more, but I‚Äôm not in any more pain. I think part of the swelling is from the air they pumped in my abdomen to do the surgery. I have noticed more pressure where they stitched my umbilical hernia up though. I‚Äôve stuck to my Tylenol and ibuprofen combo, and haven‚Äôt touched the oxy that the doctor prescribed.

**American Airlines**

Cons:

* Unreliable -- bad on-time performance. If it's not a morning flight, all bets are off. 
* ORD hub is prone to weather delays
* Ugh, that hub in CLT.
* In Flight Entertainment is all streaming to device only
* Some flights use regional jets 
* Strange standby rules (must connect at same connection airport as original ticket and must have the exact same number of stops)
* Even though AA has a comprehensive network, more flyers may be using it to make up missed connections and delayed flights

Pros:

* Often have the surprise option to check a carry-on bag at the self check-in kiosk on full flights for free 
* Can use points or cash to choose a seat in Basic Economy
* Can earn points just buying stuff online other places with their promo program
* Majority of the staff are union
* Can gate check a bag for free
* Decent seat comfort
* Will help you if you miss your flight
* Possibility of interlining on another carrier if needed


**Delta**

Cons: 

* Expensive
* Can't ala carte choose a seat in Basic Economy like AA or United
* No free opportunities to check a bag on full flights at the kiosk like AA  
* Only pilots and dispatchers are union; active anti-union measures 
* Some flights use regional jets
* Credit card is an AMEX

Pros: 

* Free seatback video screen with in flight entertainment and Live TV on 737 or bigger jet
* In-flight snack service is often very good. Ex: handing out more coffee and water on trays after the cart has passed.
* Best on-time performance
* Basic Economy can change seat for free when checking in at airport self service kiosk (not very useful on full flights as there's no seats to change to)
* Can gate check a bag for free
* Robust network that often can accommodate missed connections and cancelled flights
* Decent seat comfort. IMHO, the best economy seat comfort of all, personal opinion 
* Well-maintained fleet of jets much older than other carriers, almost like a flying museum, really. Did you ever want to fly on a 23 year old former Northwest Airlines 757 still rocking a NW tail number? Delta's got you covered!
* Possibility of interlining on another carrier if needed


**United**

Cons:

* Expensive
* Basic Economy doesn't get a carry on bag at all -- gotta pay extra. United needs their money.
* Basic Economy can only check-in online if they have a credit card on file to charge the carry-on fee and fines to. Otherwise, the ticket counter must verify you have a personal item only when you check-in at the airport.
* EWR hub is just absolutely horrible. Ugh.
* ORD hub is prone to weather delays
* No free opportunities to check a bag on full flights at the kiosk like AA 
* The ""bundles"" offered to Basic Economy are pretty bad deals compared to just upgrading to Economy before booking
* Some flights use regional jets

Pros: 

* On-time performance lagging closely behind Delta
* Some planes have seat back video screens with Live TV
* Can buy a seat ala carte in Basic Economy for a nominal fee, unlike Delta
* Majority of staff are union
* Can gate check a bag for free, except Basic Economy
* Decent seat comfort
* Robust network that often can accommodate missed connections and cancelled flights
* Will help you if you miss your flight
* Possibility of interlining on another carrier if needed


**Southwest (after May 28)**

Cons:

* Snack service often cancelled on short flights
* Maui Monk pretzels in service stink up the plane like onion and garlic, what were they thinking?
* In Flight Entertainment is all streaming to device only
* All Boeing 737 fleet, recent Boeing issues in the news
* Will NOT interline on another carrier, pretty much one of the few things SWA does that make it technically a low cost airline.

Pros:

* Only fly 737s, no regional jets. Pilots trained to operate all equipment.
* Limited ability to change basic economy tickets with no fee
* Majority of staff are union, highest paid 737 pilots around
* Some very nice flight attendants
* Can get a full can of soda-pop in service just for asking (make sure to say no cup so they can put it on their tray, not their pocket)
* Good ""flat tire"" policy, will help you if you miss your flight
* Robust network that often can accommodate missed connections and cancelled flights
* Customer of Size policy for larger passengers
* Decent seat comfort, old seats (to be determined with seat reconfiguration changes)
* Can gate-check a bag for free


**Allegiant**

Cons: 

* Ultra low cost airline
* Carry-on bag costs extra
* Can't gate-check a bag 
* Only fly some routes 1-3 times a week. Have to wait days if flight is cancelled and hope the next one isn't sold out, or figure out alternative transportation at your own expense.
* Limited leg room and uncomfortable seats
* No snack service for free
* No in flight entertainment
* Not helpful at all if you miss your flight
* By the time the add-ons are included, it's often cheaper to fly other full-service airlines that include them
* Will NOT interline on another carrier

Pros:

* All A320 series jets, no Boeing issues, no regional jets. Pilots trained to operate all equipment.
* Good on-time performance, especially for an ultra low cost airline
* Typically will only bust obvious glaring personal item violations at the gate


**Frontier**

Cons: 

* Ultra low cost airline
* Worst on-time performance of any domestic airline. If it's not a morning flight, all bets are off.  If there's a connection involved, you could have a really bad time.
* Carry-on bag costs extra
* Gate agents known to force people to pay $99 to check a personal item that is ""too big"" even if it's fine. Agent gets a $10 cut of the fee, so abuse is likely. ""It rubbed against the side of the sizer"" yet it still technically fit.
* Agents known to force people to buy a seat or else risk being bumped. 
* Time limitations for checking bags can cause problems when there's only one ticket agent and the line isn't moving. Possibility to miss the flight or have to abandon luggage due to hard time limits on checking. 
* If you were trying to check just a carry-on, then you are in the ""best"" shape, because you get to pay $99 to check your carry-on sized bag on top of what you already paid to try to check it at the ticket counter. It's real bad idea to try to check anything with Frontier. Don't take more than a carry-on and a personal item IMHO.
* Can't gate-check a bag 
* Only flies some routes 1-3 times a week, or at most once a day. Have to wait days if flight is cancelled or figure out alternative transportation at your own expense.
* Limited leg room and uncomfortable seats.
* No snack service for free
* No free in flight entertainment
* No ticket changes. When buying the ability to change, can only change once
* Not helpful at all if you miss your flight
* By the time the add-ons and gotcha fees are included, it's often cheaper to fly other full-service airlines that include them
* Will NOT interline on another carrier

Pros:

* Fly a modern fleet of A320neo series jets which are very fuel efficient, low CO2 emissions, no Boeing issues, no regional jets. Pilots trained to operate all equipment.
* Can get some deals if you're flexible and willing to take a gamble
* Friend with a Frontier credit card says Frontier isn't bad because the credit card avoids most of the bogus fees they try to charge

I highly recommend green tea, matcha, and black tea. Caffeine may interact with meds, so you may need to consult your doctor first.

Don't want to impose myself into things in fear of being a burden to others.

Work as a nurse in geriatrics and hospice, for a private agency in Quebec, eventually have to go back into the public health sector which sucks major balls but that's life. Wouldn't say I have depression but do have anxiety issues that out of my control, severely introverted but try to manage to overcome those challenges. Years of dealing being close with certain people and family issues have made me passive, nothing bothers me anymore and just accept how things are and keep smiling. Just wish sometimes I had someone to vent to and cry sometimes, just to be told everything will be fine would mean so much.

Out of impulse I've been trying out a work out routine and focusing on my endurance, feel some sort of accomplishment and trying to maintain self discipline.

So getting a beginner board isn‚Äôt really what I‚Äôm looking for I want to basically spend the money once and learn on it vs buying a second one down the line. 

Here is what I‚Äôm looking for:
‚Ä¢ My budget is under $1k
‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt care about top speed and don‚Äôt need crazy range cause it will be a ride around for fun, and getting coffee/ errands
‚Ä¢ I want a board that‚Äôs reliable and the company has good customer service
‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt want a longboard I‚Äôm looking for more of a shortboard/ cruiser that can carve a little
‚Ä¢ I also want a board I can put bigger wheels on so I can handle the rougher cement roads in areas
‚Ä¢weight doesn‚Äôt matter too much but the size does
‚Ä¢ I want a board that‚Äôs fun and comfortable while still being a cruiser but also that isn‚Äôt too high or give me the about to lower the board with aftermarket spacers 


I‚Äôd love to hear what you guys think about belt vs hub. I live in a really hilly area but nothing crazy steep and the noise level of it doesn‚Äôt matter much unless a belt drive is super loud. Any recommendations would be really awesome!

I had a cherry latte from Starbucks last night, so I knew going into sleep that I‚Äôd have some caffeine coursing through my veins.
It was gonna be rough. So I decided to take some melatonin. I had a glass of water and did some breathing exercises before falling asleep.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm not great with caffeine‚Äîif I have coffee past noon, I‚Äôm usually up until about 4 AM.
Pretty crazy for a 43-year-old to still not have this regulated, but here I am, doing box breathing to counteract the bean water.
I had it too late in the day. That one‚Äôs on me.

Once I settled into sleep, the next thing I knew, my brain was waking me up‚Äîand I felt well rested.
I reached out to find my wife and wrapped my arms around her. It was a tight, warm embrace‚Äîone of those half-asleep but cozy moments.

As my senses started to come online, I began to hear things in the background.
My ears tuned in to the sound of the shower running. From a distance, I heard my wife‚Äôs voice, playfully talking to the cats, who had apparently decided to mess with the water.

‚ÄúNo chompies,‚Äù she said, as Sniffles had clearly infiltrated the shower and was taking playful, lunging bites at the falling water.

As my still-groggy brain tried to process this wake-up, a chill came over me.
My breath quickened. What had been a cool room suddenly felt hot‚Äîbecause whatever I was holding onto in bed wasn‚Äôt my wife.

I‚Äôve never felt so cold and so hot at the same time.

The shower in the other room felt a mile away.
The bedroom turned cold and silent.

I bring up the temperature multiple times here because‚Äîif you know, you know‚Äîit was something unlike anything I‚Äôve ever felt before.
The only sound I could hear was the beads of sweat hitting my chest, dripping from my face‚Äîstill pressed against the forehead of whoever (or whatever) I thought was my wife.

It was still.
But then, it moved.

That hot-and-cold forehead remained against mine, but I began to hear movement‚Äîsomething slithering.

Then, a thud.

My eyes snapped open.

In that moment, the thing that had been pressed against me slinked off the bed like a snake unraveling.

I was staring into eyes‚Äîeyes that were supposed to be my wife‚Äôs‚Äîbut they weren‚Äôt.
The smile was there, but it wasn‚Äôt hers.
It was the kind of polite smile strangers give each other while passing on a hiking trail‚Äîjust a slight dimple, nothing warm.

The slinking, snake-like thing, still facing me, fell to the floor.
I lay there in bed, paralyzed with fear, trying to make sense of what was happening‚Äîtrying to figure out how to get out of this.

I shut my eyes.
That usually made it go away when I was a kid.
It‚Äôs worked before. Surely it would work now.

I opened my eyes again, more lucid this time.

Wow. What a weird dream.
Everything seemed so real.
The room was exactly as I had left it‚Äîthe temperature, the sweat, the sound‚Ä¶

As I started to regain clarity, I realized I still heard something coming from the other room.
But then I also realized‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt the shower I had heard.

It was the bathroom fan.

There was no shower.
And Sarah isn‚Äôt even home‚Äîshe‚Äôs working a 24-hour shift.

Also‚Ä¶ where were the cats during all of this?
Aren‚Äôt they supposed to be like little demon protectors?

I wiped the sweat off my brow and tugged at my now completely soaked T-shirt.
‚ÄúIt was a dream,‚Äù I said out loud. Whether I believed it or not was unimportant.

As my eyes lifted from the fabric, I spotted the kitties.
Pickles was crouched down in attack mode.
Sniffles was full Halloween cat.

Both of them were side-by-side, locked together and staring.
Something had woken them up too‚Äîand it was on the other side of the bed.

All these years, all the work, all the therapy to make this go away‚Ä¶
And it was back.

I knew, before my eyes even got there‚Äî
it was back.",1,1746660448.0,LucidDreaming,1,1.0,False

April 2024, I met a guy while standing in line at a coffee shop. We chatted for a bit, decided to share a table, and THREE HOURS of conversation later, he walked me to my car...and kissed me. It was lightning in a bottle. I am 50, he is 51.

He had been in town for work, and lived 7 hrs away, but for the last year, we've managed to get together every month, sometimes twice a month for 1-2 weeks at a time, talked/texted every single day. We fell deeply in love, or so he led me to believe. I was his ""angel,"" the ""love of his life,"" he ""never knew someone like me existed"". I felt it was a connection unlike any I've ever had. Three months into the relationship, he started talking about a future. I was elated. We talked budgets, bank statements, chores, and had long talks about where we'd live. We decided that we'd continue getting to know each other and aim to begin taking steps toward a future by Dec 2025. As fall approached, however, I noticed the future talk was waning. He was still just as consistent, still seemed very much in love, just not talking about ""us"". He told me it was because he saw trouble looming at his job because of the election. 

Fast forward, he just lost his job, could possibly lose his house, is trying to ramp up a lucrative hobby business to shore up his income, and says he ""can't be what I need right now."" He's told me December is unrealistic, that he still wants our future, but has no idea when it could happen, and he ""wouldn't blame me if I left."" I've been willing to prioritize the relationship first, follow through with the commitment, and tackle these issues together, but he seems adamant that he needs to handle it on his own.

At this point, I just feel like a burden, so I decided to walk away gracefully, leaving the door open for him to contact me if and when he is really ready for a life with me. I feel like it was the only decision that honored my self-respect, but I'm crushed. He said he'd reflect on what I said and thanked me for my honesty and patience. I will not reach out again unless he does. I harbor a hope he might feel my absence and realize what he's lost, but I can't give myself false hope. I'm so angry he led me on about a life together and pulled back this way. I just couldn't allow him to put me in a position where I'm waiting indefinitely for his actions to match his words.

Days 1-4, I wake up feeling kind dizzy like low bp. In follicular, I can get brain fog, muscle tension, and headaches too, which may be low sodium (and potentially mag). Which I thought I was getting enough of but apparently not!

Sorry it's too short to actually post so the bottom will be the lyrics of Mr. Boombastic


There was a man walking down the street, he had a limp, his best friend had stepped on a landmine the second night of patrol, he could still remember the flames engulfing them and saw the charred figure of his brother flying into pieces, it all seemed so slow.... But that was the past and now he was just walking, alone, alert, the war torn and battle scarred man was on his way to the coffee shop, his usual meeting spot. These were his thoughts...
""Damn this limp, if only that bastard looked a little""
""Lucky me though huh, I get to keep kicking""
""This coffee sure better be worth it""
Then he felt a chill on the back of his neck, an unmistakable chill, that rush of terror and shock all in a second
""No it couldn't be, not here, not now""
""What the hell could she have needed me for*
""If only I could move""

7) Any good food spots at Goa campus? What food items would you recommend? 

8) How is the food of the mess? Meaning the taste of it. I have watched videos and there are mixed reviews. 

9) If y'all wash your clothes yourself where do you dry them? Is there a clothesline or something? 

10) How do they know if you've eaten or not? In the mess? 

11)  How is the gym? Is there a treadmill and elliptical cycle? 

12) Can you go home in the summer term? Or do you need to be paying for those months as well in hostel and mess fees? 

13) Is the 10GB wifi enough for watching series/movie in a day?

I‚Äôm plus-sized, 5‚Äô2‚Äù, and Latina. I usually dress business casual. Fancy pants and tiny heels are kind of my thing. I don‚Äôt do full makeup, just eyeliner and lip gloss. I don‚Äôt wear jewelry besides a leg anklet I never take off. My vibe is soft, observant, warm, and lowkey intense (but in a cozy way).

I have two small kiddos, so life is full, but I still have space for someone kind and emotionally grounded. I live with anxiety and depression, and I know that might be a dealbreaker for some. That‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm not expecting anyone to fix it. Just be decent and emotionally present. I‚Äôm emotionally aware, intelligent, and feel things deeply. When I care, I care fully.

Nothing super locked down, just things like login via email or social media, maybe show a custom landing page, stuff like that.

For one of the spots, we ended up using this beambox that offers a branded portal and lets guests log in before they connect. It wasn‚Äôt crazy technical to deploy and didn‚Äôt require replacing their existing router setup. Kind of surprised me.

Are there others here that has experience with this kind of captive portal setups? Especially ones that are lightweight enough for a local business to manage without a dedicated IT person. I‚Äôve heard of folks doing it manually with mikrotik or pfsense but that feels like overkill for most of these places.

Would love to hear what you‚Äôre using, what works (and what doesn‚Äôt) and any weird things you‚Äôve run into especially around privacy, uptime or client complaints.",1,1746659105.0,wifi,2,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt think there is any active ingredient in them. I am prescribed two daily doses of 30mg to soften a spike in efficacy that increases physical symptoms of anxiety if taking 60mg at once. Despite this, I can take 60mg at once and feel nothing. My body isn‚Äôt metabolizing anything. It‚Äôs like somebody is fucking with me and giving me decafe coffee while I struggle to figure out why my system is so off.

To answer common replies:
- I‚Äôve been timing sleep, going to need by 10pm and waking by 7:30am with no alarm daily.
- I get enough protein, regularly having a pea protein shake with chlorela for b12 in the morning before first dose. I also will have at least 2 full 20oz glasses of water to start the day.
- I take omega 6 daily, and vit c and magnesium in the evenings
- i have 3-6 L of water a day depending on exercise. Beyond 3 is always accompanied by electrolytes with no vit c
- I alternate cardio, weights, and easy yoga daily. This is hard to keep up on when my meds don‚Äôt work. I end up basically laying on my yoga mat and falling asleep.
- my life is fairly stress free at the moment and eating well.

Is there something I can do? I‚Äôm basically back to watching days go by because this vyvanse is bogus. ",0,1746658809.0,VyvanseADHD,1,0.5,False

So far they don‚Äôt explicitly know that I‚Äôm dating this person, and I feel like maybe they‚Äôd be more understanding if I were to tell them that we‚Äôd been dating, because I‚Äôd just be staying in the closet, rather than sneaking behind their backs?
