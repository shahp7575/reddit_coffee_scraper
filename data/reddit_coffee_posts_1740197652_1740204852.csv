### **The Muse That Never Left**     
     
**Prologue**  
In a sleepy mid-Atlantic town where the days pass like quiet whispers and the nights hum with forgotten dreams, Alex—an unassuming writer—lived a life of routine. His small apartment overlooked an aging row of brick buildings, and every morning, the same grey skies greeted him. Yet beneath the calm veneer of suburban life, something stirred.

**Act I: The Call**  
It began on an ordinary Tuesday. As Alex sipped his coffee and scribbled in his worn journal, a strange sensation crept over him—a gentle pulse in his mind, like a distant drumbeat. At first, it was nothing more than a flicker: an idea, a phrase, a sudden image of a hero, a villain, a scene bursting with cinematic grandeur. But then the ideas multiplied, cascading through his thoughts in an overwhelming rush. 

Visions of reboots and sequels of beloved fan-favorite franchises, reimagined with razor-sharp wit and fresh twists, danced before his eyes. The Universe, it seemed, had chosen him as its vessel for creativity. Each idea was like a siren call, beckoning him to pack his bags, fly to Hollywood, and transform tired scripts into legendary epics. The voice was insistent, almost pleading: ""Alex, bring these stories to life. The world awaits your genius!""

For days, the visions intensified—an endless torrent of plot twists, character arcs, and dazzling cinematic moments. His notebook filled with intricate diagrams and cryptic sketches, the pages humming with possibility. Hollywood studios were clamoring for a fresh take, and every fiber of the Universe urged him westward.

**Act II: The Resistance**  
Yet despite the torrent of inspiration, Alex felt a pull in the opposite direction. The clamor of the city, the bright neon promises of Los Angeles, the relentless pressure to conform to blockbuster formulas—it all felt alien, oppressive. In his quiet town, far from the glitz and glare of Hollywood, he found solace in the simple, the understated, the profoundly personal.

Late at night, as the wind whispered through the narrow streets and the moon hung like a silent sentinel in the sky, Alex would retreat to his study. There, in the dim glow of a single lamp, he began to write short stories—tales that fused his hard-won wisdom with the raw, unvarnished truth of his own experience. His words were honest, sometimes melancholic, often laced with a wry humor that belied the overwhelming pressure of the ideas that had once almost swept him away.

He found that while the Universe’s call to Hollywood was grand and seductive, it was also hollow—a promise of instant fame that could strip the soul of its quiet beauty. Instead, he chose to explore the intimate, the personal, the moments that spoke not of blockbuster battles but of the quiet resilience of everyday life.

**Act III: The Aftermath**  
As weeks turned into months, the visions receded, replaced by a steady, introspective rhythm. The notebook that had once overflowed with ambitious screenplays now housed delicate, poetic short stories that captured the essence of human longing, imperfection, and redemption. Alex’s decision not to heed the siren call of Hollywood became his greatest work of art—a quiet rebellion against the forces that sought to commodify creativity.

Yet sometimes, when the night is deep and the town is hushed, Alex hears that faint pulse again—a reminder of what might have been, and of the vast, mysterious Universe that still whispers its secrets. He smiles at the memory, knowing that his choice was not one of failure, but of integrity.

**Epilogue**  
In the end, Alex’s work touched those who needed to be reminded that creativity isn’t about the spectacle of mega-productions, but about the intimate conversation between the writer’s heart and the reader’s soul. Hollywood may have its blockbusters, but in a small mid-Atlantic town, one writer’s quiet revolution lives on—one short story at a time.

1ivc53j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ivc53j/my_job_as_a_fire_lookout_went_terribly_wrong/,My job as a fire lookout went terribly wrong,"I took this job because I needed the solitude. The fire lookout tower, perched high above the endless Montana wilderness, promised exactly that. A single-room cabin atop a skeletal frame of timber, swaying slightly in the wind, offering an unmatched view of the valleys below. It was beautiful in the daylight. At night, though, it was something else entirely.

The first few days were uneventful. I settled into a routine—morning coffee on the deck, scanning the horizon for smoke, logging my observations. I read books, listened to the radio, and let the quiet sink into my bones. It was peaceful in a way I hadn’t felt in years. The isolation wasn’t just welcomed—it was necessary.

By the third night, I had grown used to the sounds of the forest—the rustling of trees, the distant hoot of an owl, the wind rattling the old frame of the tower. So when I first heard the tapping, I barely noticed it. Just the wind, I told myself. Maybe a bird pecking at the glass.

Then came the whispers.

They were faint at first, more like the suggestion of words than actual speech. I told myself it was my imagination, the wind filtering through the trees in just the right way. But as the night wore on, they grew more distinct—though I still couldn’t make out what they were saying.

On the fifth night, I finally saw it.

I was writing in my logbook when I noticed a shape outside the window. At first, it looked like a branch swaying, but then I saw the eyes—two pinpricks of reflected moonlight staring right at me. My stomach dropped. It was a face.

And it was upside down.

I froze. The lookout tower was nearly sixty feet off the ground. There was nothing to hang from, no way for anything to be up there. But there it was, peering in at me, mouth slightly open, its breath fogging the glass.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. I wanted to believe it was a trick of the light, but the thing blinked.

I scrambled back, knocking over my chair. The figure lingered, head tilting in an unnatural, jerky motion. Then, without a sound, it dropped out of sight.

The next morning, I found footprints in the dirt below the tower. They weren’t human. They weren’t even animal. They were elongated, twisted—like a person had been walking on all fours, but their limbs bent the wrong way.

I called it in, but what was I supposed to say? That I saw something impossible? The dispatcher humored me, told me to log it, and suggested I might be tired.

That night, I locked the door. I kept the lantern burning, even though it made shadows dance in the corners. Hours passed, and nothing happened. Just the wind, the creak of the old wood, my own heartbeat in my ears. I almost convinced myself I had imagined the whole thing.

Then, just past midnight, the whispers started again. Closer this time. I clenched my teeth, refusing to acknowledge them. But then came the tapping. Not on the window this time.

On the trapdoor beneath my feet.

The only way up the tower was the staircase. The trapdoor was the last barrier between me and whatever was outside. The tapping turned to scratching. A slow, deliberate scraping of nails against wood.

Then, the voice came.

Not a whisper anymore. A ragged, breathy mimicry of my own voice:

“Let me in.”

I squeezed my eyes shut, pressing my back against the far wall. The scratching stopped. Silence pressed against me like a physical weight.

Then—

A single, soft tap against the window behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

I don’t know how long I stood there, frozen. When I finally did turn, morning light was creeping over the horizon. The window was empty. The forest was still.

But I wasn’t alone.

Because outside, on the ground far below, I saw them.

Dozens of figures, standing among the trees. Staring up at me.

And every single one of them was upside down.

Then, they moved.

Not like people walking—like puppets yanked by invisible strings. Their heads lolled, arms jerked unnaturally, but they were getting closer, creeping toward the base of the tower.

Then came the sound—deep, resonant, like wood groaning under immense pressure. The tower shuddered. Something was pushing against it. I could feel it swaying as the wood seemed to crack violently at every joint.

It doesn't make sense why I did it, but I left. My feet were moving for the door while my brain screamed at me to stop them. It was as if I was stuck on auto-pilot, a helpless passenger watching the plane taking a nose dive to the ground.

I grabbed my flashlight and wrenched the trapdoor open, descending the stairs two at a time. The moment my foot hit the forest floor, the things let out the most awful blood curdling screams.

I ran.

The forest was a maze of darkness and shifting shadows. I could hear them moving—branches snapping, leaves rustling, their ragged breathing impossibly close. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. Every instinct screamed at me to just run.

Then I saw the road.

A single, narrow path cutting through the trees. I sprinted toward it, lungs burning, legs screaming in protest. The figures were right behind me, their movements erratic, inhuman.

Then—headlights.

A truck. A lone driver on an empty road. I ran straight into its path, waving my arms frantically. The vehicle screeched to a halt, and the driver—an old man with wide, startled eyes, popped open the door.

I didn’t hesitate. I dove inside, gasping, screaming at him to drive.

He didn’t ask questions. He just hit the gas, tires kicking up gravel as we sped down the road. I risked one final glance out the back window.

The figures had stopped at the edge of the road, standing motionless, watching us go.

I made it home. I locked my doors. I haven't gone back to the forest. It's been weeks.

But I know it isn’t over.

I was there earlier today and prior to ordering I was reading the menu on the counter in front of the register.


I ordered 2 drinks priced at $6.50 and $8.00 on the menu however I was charged $18.00. I asked why it was different and was because the menus hadn’t been updated to the correct pricing by the owner.

The cashier was apologetic and thanked me for bringing it to her attention. She was a young girl, very clearly not her fault. I paid the $18.00 anyway cause I didn’t think it was worth the argument but I did mention to them it was false advertising and pretty sure it’s illegal to be displaying one price and charging another. 

She picked up the menu and moved it away and as I was going to sit down I noticed she put it back on the counter in front of the register .

She’s just a kid doing her job. Shame on the owner… 💯 I would not have been the first or last to pick up on it and the kids working there probably cop it on the regular cause the owner is too tight to get updated menus.

Anyway… bit miffed over it… mostly cause of the situation it puts the employees in… rant over.

(Hunger of The Well Part 2),"You can find Part 2 [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ipue3v/i_watched_my_grandfathers_farm_while_he_was_in/)

Chester and I were pretty close growing up, but over the years, that seemed to change. I got married, graduated college, started my career. Chester just seemed to be content working in his dead end job in a warehouse. Maybe that's why we quit talking. It wasn't that I didn't love my brother, it's more that I just couldn't understand him. I kept thinking that I'd make things right at some point, but that chance never seemed to come. So when I my grandfather passed and left Chester the old farm where we grew up, I decided to use it as an excuse to visit him.

I didn't tell him or my mother that I was going to the farm. I wanted it to be a surprise. I figured if I was asked what I was doing there, I'd just say I was there to pay my respects to Grandpa Silas. I wasn't that close with my grandfather. In fact, I hadn't spoken to him since I was a kid, but it still seemed more comfortable to use that lie than to tell my brother that I simply missed him. We had never been big on sharing our feelings in my family, and the idea of having a heart to heart with Chester made me feel more than a little uncomfortable.

It was January when I told my wife I'd be going down there. She wanted to come at first, but when I told her I just wanted it to be my brother and I, she seemed to understand. That's one of the reasons I loved her. She just seemed to understand me without explanation.

It was a long drive down to the farm. When I lost the signal on my cell phone and saw concrete melt away into corn and dirt, I knew I was getting close. Fortunately, I could still make local calls, but any calls out of the city just didn't seem to work. I finally arrived at the farm around four in the evening, coming up the familiar gravel drive way that wound its way to the house. I couldn't help but mentally note how little it had changed. The house stood exactly the way I had seen it last as a child. The barn was still across from it, rows of corn stretched out to the horizon, and I could even spy the squat ring of stones that marked the old well that Grandpa had told Ches and me not to play around when we were kids. I smiled when I pulled up, feeling like the place held the entirety of my childhood safely preserved in its timeless embrace.

Chester must of heard me pull up, because he came out onto the porch as I parked. Ches was only two years older than me, but when I saw him, he looked much older. His chestnut brown hair was unkempt and the rings under his eyes were so dark, he looked a little like a skull from a distance. If I hadn't of known him, I'd of thought he was ten or fifteen years older than me in that moment. I wanted to ask him what kind of hell he was going through at the moment, but fell back to the familiar inclination to ignore it. I figured he was just sad about Grandpa dying.

Lord knows, it had been tragic. The old man survived a massive stroke and was actually recovering when he had gotten into a pretty bad car accident on the way home. He had taken a taxi service from the hospital after being released, probably because he was too old to understand ride-sharing apps. The driver of the taxi had started going through a green light when a woman in a black SUV came flying through the intersection, running a red light and smashing into the side of the car. The taxi driver had survived, but the woman didn't. She and Grandpa Silas were killed almost instantly.

I hadn't kept up contact with my grandfather, not even calling him after his stroke. I had just been too busy to find the right time to do so. Someone I had loved and admired since I was a child was dead now and I hadn't spoken to him in years. That's why I was there at the farm that day. I would be damned if the same thing happened with my brother.

I got out of the car and walked up to him, feeling out of place in my khakis and white button-down shirt. He was dressed in flannel and blue jeans, looking every bit like a young version of Grandpa Silas.

“Hey Chester,” I said, hoping to see him smile as I got near.

That hope faded as I approached and saw him look confused, if not downright dismayed, by my sudden appearance.

“Daniel, what are you doing here?” he asked, and I couldn't help but hear some barely disguised reproach in his voice.

“I heard about Grandpa Silas and wanted to come by to pay my respects. Maybe catch up a little bit.”

I must have been tired from the road, because I thought Chester looked scared for just a moment.

“Of course, he's buried back in town. I'll go with you to his grave if you want.”

“Thanks. I'm sorry I haven't really been around...” I said, trying to think of where to begin repairing the rift that had come between us.

“It's okay. Life happens.”

“I know... It doesn't mean I don't want to be around more though,” I muttered awkwardly, not knowing exactly what to say and looking away from his tired gaze.

I felt his hand on my shoulder suddenly, making me look up into his face. It was a face worn and full of worry. I could see tears dancing at the corners of his eyes, barely held back by years of ingrained instincts to repress such strong emotions. We didn't cry or talk about feelings in my family, so when he pulled me into a hug in that moment, I was shocked.

“Ches, what's wrong, man?”

“A lot, Danny. A hell of a lot.”

We went inside and sat at the old kitchen table. Chester was making coffee while I talked his ear off.

“I can't believe this place still looks exactly the same as when we were kids. I wish I would have called Grandpa Silas, but when mom said he was recovering, I figured there'd be time. How have you been holding up, Ches?”

Chester didn't answer immediately. It was probably a full ten seconds before he did. I was just about to ask again when he cut through the silence in a voice that sounded like he hadn't slept in months.

“You remember that old well out there, Danny? The one that Grandpa Silas told us not to go around when we were kids?”

“Yea, I remember it. What about it?”

“There's something in that well.”

“You mean, like, water?” I chuckled, desperate to lighten the mood and wondering if Ches had gone crazy.

“No, Danny. Something bad. Grandpa told me about it right before he died. It's why I had to watch the farm. I'm supposed to feed it.”

“What do you mean 'feed it?'” I asked, becoming more and more convinced my brother had lost his mind.

“I'll show you. God knows I didn't believe it when the old man told me. You probably think I'm nuts, but everyone around here knows about it. Our great-grandfather put it there, whatever it is, and started feeding it. Grandpa told me to keep feeding it to make sure it doesn't hurt anyone. It's why he left me the farm.”

“Chester, I don't think you're nuts,” I lied. “I just think you're tired. You've been up here all by yourself for months now. You just need a break.”

“I'll tell you what, when we get back from visiting the cemetery tomorrow, I want you to stick around. I won't even say anything, you can see for yourself.”

I smiled, happy that my brother trusted me enough to ask for help. I didn't care if he was going crazy, it was the best chance I had to fix things between us.

“Of course, Ches. I'm here for you.”

Just saying those words felt like shrugging off a weight that had been crushing down on me for a long time. It felt relieving. I just wish that relief had lasted.

The next morning, Chester drove me into town in Grandpa Silas's pickup truck. The cemetery was built on a hillside overlooking a vast forest that stretched for as far as the eye could see. I may have lived in cities for the last decade, but I never did lose my love for the country. Being back in it after all those years made me feel free, like I could really breath again.

We walked up the long and winding path to a little tombstone jutting out of the ground. The grave was covered in flowers and wreaths, a testament to how much the people of the town respected him. It was no wonder, he had lived there his whole life. I stood at the foot of his grave with my brother and crouched down to lay my own bundle of flowers down, noticing an envelope laying partially covered by the wreaths and bouquets.

“What's this?” I asked picking it up.

“I don't know, open it,” said Chester with a shrug.

I pulled out the paper inside and saw it was a symbol, a circle with two curved lines drawn through it. It kind of resembled an eye. I shrugged and showed it to Ches.

“You know what it is?” I asked.

“No idea. Maybe some kind of weird local custom?”

I put the paper back in the envelope and sat it back down by the grave, feeling like it would be disrespectful to interfere with it any further. As I stood back up, I saw something move in the distant treeline. It vanished into the woods just as my eyes settled on it, but for a moment, I could of sworn there was a hooded figure standing out there watching us. I almost mentioned it to Ches, but stopped myself. He was under enough stress as it was and he didn't need me adding to it.

We drove back to the farm and Chester offered to make us lunch. We sat there eating ham sandwiches and drinking coffee, and for the first time since I had arrived, I saw Ches smile.

“You know, this reminds me of when we were kids,” he said.

“I know what you mean. It's like when grandma would make us sandwiches when we came to visit.”

“Yea, remember when-”

He was suddenly cut off by what sounded like a loud shriek that made me think someone was being killed outside. I jumped to my feet to rush out the door, but Ches caught my shoulder and held me back. The smile had vanished from his face completely.

“It's time for me to show you the well,” he whispered.

He led me outside to the side of the house where the cellar was. We walked down there to an old freezer in the corner. I didn't know what the hell was going on, but he grabbed a hunk of beef from it and started back outside in the direction of the well. The screaming sound got louder as we approached.

“What is that, Ches?” I asked, unable to keep the fear from my voice.

“It's Grandpa Silas's dirty secret. It's the well.”

We were standing in front of it at that point, the howl beginning to die away as he tossed the hunk of meat into the gaping hole in the ground. I stared at him in confusion, opening my mouth to inquire further, but he held up his hand to silence me.

A short second later, I heard the meaty sound of bone snapping underneath flesh echoing up from the well.

“What the fuck was that?” I asked Ches, feeling the blood draining from my cheeks.

“I wish I had a good answer for that. Whatever it is, it lives in the well and I have to feed it every day.”

“Or what?”

“Or it goes hunting.”

“What the hell does that mean?”

“I have no idea, but I know I don't ever want to find out,” Ches said, turning to walk back towards the farm house.

I started to follow him, but stopped. For just a moment, out in the endless fields of corn, I thought I saw something. It was just the hint of a shape, but it looked familiar. It looked like the same hooded figure I saw at the graveyard. I turned towards Chester, but saw he was already a good distance away. Besides, I was just jumpy from the weird shit happening with the well. It was probably just a neighbor who accidentally wandered on to the property or something. I looked back to where I saw the flash of movement in the corn field, but there was nothing there now besides the sea of green being rustled by invisible waves of wind.

When we were back in the house, I was already working on a plan. As Chester started making a pot of coffee, I found a pen and a notepad to start organizing what we knew so far.

“What are you writing down?” Ches asked me as he sat down a cup of coffee next to me and took a seat across the table.

“Okay, so here's what we know so far. There's something in that well that we can assume is dangerous. It can be contained there as long as we feed it meat every day. Am I right so far?”

“Yea, but there's some parts you don't know about.”

“Like what?”

“Well, on the harvest moon, it needs a human body.”

I stopped writing in my notepad and looked up at him. He shrugged and took a sip of coffee.

“What the fuck are you talking about?” I asked, hearing my own voice trembling with shock.

“Apparently, once a year, the coroner in town would set aside a corpse to be fed to the well. I had to do it a few months back, right before I got the news about grandpa. So you can jot that down too.”

I sat stunned for a moment, then, not knowing what else to do, wrote it down in the notepad.

“Okay, so you have to feed a body to it once a year.” I said, trying to ignore how crazy it sounded. “What else do we know?”

Ches leaned back for a moment, deep in thought.

“It can throw things back up the well,” he finally said.

“What do you mean?”

“When I first got here, I lowered a lantern down the well. It chewed it up and spat it back out with enough force to send it flying into the air. Scared the hell out of me,” he muttered, chuckling a little as he finished the thought.

“Okay, so it can spit things back up. Anything else you can think of?”

“Yea, the coroner said something to me. He said that it hunted like a trapdoor spider. So we can presume that whatever it is, it's an ambush predator. It digs holes and waits for prey. Oh, and it makes the corn grow.”

“It makes the corn grow?”

“Yea, he and grandpa kept saying 'feed the well and the well feeds us.' He said it's how they survived the dust bowl back in the day.”

“Okay, so there's something down there that hunts like a trapdoor spider, feeds on flesh, demands human bodies once a year, can spit things up through the well and makes the corn grow.”

“Yep. That's about the long and the short of it,” Chester said matter-of-factly, downing the rest of his coffee.

I leaned back in my chair, digesting all the information while Chester stared at me. I found myself hoping that if he was crazy, it wasn't infectious. Then, I considered the alternative and decided being crazy would be better. I looked over the notes I had written and back up to him, finally deciding to believe this was all really happening.

“I think we need to kill this thing,” I finally said.

“I thought about that, but what if we just piss it off? I'm sure we wouldn't be the first ones to try.”

“What the hell else can we do, Ches?”

“We feed it. We feed it and hope it never gets out.”

We didn't talk much for the rest of the night. I turned in early, sleeping in one of the spare bedrooms. It took me a long time to finally drift off. I kept questioning my sanity and trying to come to a logical explanation for all this. I fell asleep without ever arriving at an answer.

The next day, I stood over the well. It was early, the sun barely peaking over the horizon to begin the day. I stared down into its depths, pushing against the futility of my attempt to discern what the hell was down there. I thought of my brother, trapped alone with this thing for months and slowly losing his mind. I thought of the people that had disappeared into the darkness of that maw. I thought of my wife, of my grandfather, my mother. Finally, I thought of how angry I was that the thing was hurting my family.

“Damn you!” I yelled into the dark pit. “Why the hell do you exist?! Why can't you just die of old age already!”

I picked up one of the loose stones from the ring bordering it and threw it down into the well with all my might. I expected to hear a dull thunk of stone hitting the bottom, but instead, I heard laughter. It was deep and full of bass, causing my chest to vibrate with each guffaw.

“Can you understand me?” I heard myself say in disbelief.

In response, the thing just laughed harder. Finally, as the laughter began to quiet, I heard a sound that took my brain a moment to realize I was hearing a single word stretched into unnatural lengths.

“Huuuuuuuuuunnnnngggggrrrryyyyyyyyy...”

That's when Chester threw me to the ground. I hadn't even heard him come up behind me. The first I knew of his presence was the two hands that had gripped my shoulders and threw me sideways.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” he whispered from above me.

I said nothing, just stared at the ground. I didn't know what to say, so I just stood up and began walking back to the house. Chester followed me without a word. I had thought he was angry with me, but when we got inside, he pulled me into a hug.

“Don't go near that thing anymore, Danny. Just don't. Just go home to your wife, to mom. Just go home.”

“I can't let it get you either, Ches. We have to stop it!” I said, feeling tears pool in my eyes. “We have to kill it!”

“... okay,” he finally whispered. “We'll kill it.”

I looked at him in relief, a smile spreading across my face despite my desperate tears.

“It's about damn time!”

Across the house was the old barn our grandfather had used to store corn and tools, as well as shelter the sheep and cows and where Chester and I had played as children. He pulled open the large doors and pointed inside. There in the gloom of that barn, with dust motes dancing in the meager rays of light penetrating the interior, was a pile of sacks near the back.

“What am I looking at Ches?”

“Fertilizer, Danny. Ammonium nitrate fertilizer. The same stuff used in the Oklahoma City bombing. And there's a shit load of it.”

“What the hell are we going to do with that?” I asked.

“We're going to feed the well.”

Over the next two days, I fed the well while Chester worked in the barn on the bomb. He started by scooping the powder into a coffee grinder, then pouring the fine dust into an old feeding trough. In the meantime, I shot one of the cows and went about the process of cleaning it. When I was done, the legless, skinless and headless body of the beast was laying on the barn floor next to him.

He was looking different than when I had first seen him. Originally, he had looked resigned. More than that, he had looked defeated. However, as he sat there in the barn and meticulously went about the work of creating our weapon, he looked determined. He looked more like the Chester I remembered.

On the second day, I went out to feed the well and stopped in my tracks. Someone had drawn that same symbol of the eye shape on the stones in black paint. I tossed the hunk of meat into the hole and went running back to Chester. I found him in the barn kneeling over the carcass of the cow we had slaughtered earlier, stuffing the body cavity with white powder. He looked up as I came in, standing as he saw the look on my face.

A short while later, we were both standing by the well and looking at the symbol.

“What the hell do you think it means?” he asked me.

“I got no idea, but it's the same thing we saw at grandpa's grave.”

“Someone is trying to send us a message,” he muttered to me, then spun around, yelling into the corn fields stretching endlessly around us. “It's too bad they don't know how to speak fucking English!”

Suddenly, my eyes widened in realization.

“Or they're trying to distract us...”

Chester looked at me with an expression of alarm before breaking into a sprint. We ran back to the barn, just in time to see a group of people in dark hoods dragging the dead cow towards a waiting pickup truck in the drive way.

“Hey! Hey stop!” I yelled, pulling ahead of Ches.

I was almost on them when I was thrown down to the ground by someone from behind.

“That's enough, you boys are done,” said the man looming over me. I could see the same symbol that had been on the well stitched in white on the front of his hooded jacket, but my eye didn't focus on it long. It was more concerned with the gun in the man's hand.

“You and your brother had one job! One fucking job! Just feed the damn well and it feeds us!” he screamed at me, cocking back the hammer of the pistol as he did so. “Do you know how much we rely on the corn produced here? You're going to ruin more than a century worth of hard work just because you two are cowards!”

I glanced over to the house as I heard feet pounding on the wood porch and saw two more of the hooded people running through the open door of our late grandfather. In that moment, I didn't think in words. I thought of my wife's face, Chester's weary eyes, my mom's hugs. I was certain I was going to die. I closed my eyes and tried to breath normally, determined to find some measure of peace in the moment before my death, and waited for the end.

I flinched as I heard the blast of a gun, but opened my eyes when I realized it had come from the house. My eyes were glued to the door as one of the hooded men came sprinting through it, only to fly forward as a second blast echoed through the sea of corn around us. The man standing over me pointed the gun at the doorway, taking aim.

I used to play football back in High School. Chester would come to all my games, even though he clearly didn't care about sports at all. He'd mostly sit in the bleachers, talking to friends and ignoring what was happening on the field. The only time he paid attention was when the special team would come out to kick the ball. That's when he'd cheer for me, always the loudest one in the crowd. Every time I heard him cheer like that for me, I'd wind up and kick that damn ball as hard as I could.

I put one foot on the ground to act as my ballast and kicked upwards with every bit of strength I had, right into the gun wielding man's groin. I felt a burst of pain erupt from my ankle as it crashed into flesh. The man immediately dropped the gun and made a strange gasping sound as Chester sprinted out onto the porch, shotgun in hand.

I spun my body on the ground, rolling over and away from the man who was now retching with the agony of having his testicles crushed, looking up again just in time to see Chester turn the man's face into a bloody mess of torn flesh and buckshot.

I laid there breathing hard as Chester walked over to me. He held out a hand and I took it, putting all my weight on my uninjured foot as I stood up. We turned and watched the pickup truck speed off down the highway. I looked over at the dead man next to me in awe.

“That might be one of the most painful deaths imaginable,” I said in shock.

I looked back up in time to see the truck disappear around the corner, our cow-bomb going with it.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

“The locals. That was the coroner there,” he said, giving the body next to us a nudge with his foot. “Pretty sure that one over there was the sheriff.”

“So... what now?” I asked.

Chester smiled and pointed at the barn.

“We go get the well's last meal ready.”

“But they took the cow...”

“Yea, a cow with hardly any ammonium nitrate in it. I'd only just started filling it. Besides, we have something better than a cow now,” he said, jerking his thumb at the coroner's dead body next to us.

It was probably one of the most disgusting things I've ever done, but we prepared the body the same way we did the cow. We did the same to the other two he killed in the farm house and started stuffing them with powder. I sacrificed my cell phone to make the detonator and crammed it into the bloody neck hole of one of the bodies. We tied the three headless torsos together with baling wire stepped back to admire our handiwork.

“Well... there's a sight I'll never be able to get out of my mind...” I murmured.

We dragged the disgusting bomb over to the foot of the well. As we approached, the symbol was still clear on the ring of stones.

“Hey, Ches, I just figured out what that symbol is.”

Chester looked up at me, confused.

“What do you mean?”

“I thought it was a circle with an eye in the middle, but it isn't. It's a mouth. It's supposed to be the well.”

He stared at it for a while.

“Do you think Grandpa Silas was part of them?”

“I don't know. I hope he wasn't. I guess it doesn't matter anymore,” I said.

We sat there in silence, listening to the wind whisper over the fields.

“Thanks for coming, Danny. I'm glad you did.”

“I am too. So, what now?”

“We do what Grandpa Silas told us to do. It's time to feed the well.”

We hefted the mass of flesh on top of the wall of stones and balanced it there. We gave each other a look and dropped it in.

We jogged back to the house, my ankle throbbing all the while, and got into my car. Chester pulled out his cell phone and handed it to me.

“Hey, can you do me a favor and call my brother? I haven't called him in a while and I can't remember his number.”

I grinned and punched it in, hitting the gas and handing the phone back to Ches as I pressed down on the pedal.

“There's the number. You should call though, I got a feeling he's been waiting to hear from you for a while.”

We got onto the road and I punched it as hard as I could. Chester hit the call button and the sky behind us erupted into an orange ball of fury. The blast shook the car so violently that I swerved, but managed to correct it. Chester shrugged and looked up at me.

“Hope that worked.”

We drove as hard and fast as we could until the sun began sinking down beneath the distant horizon. We had driven in silence for an hour. Finally, I spoke up.

“We killed three people, Ches. We butchered them too.”

“They were trying to kill us, Danny. They sacrificed God knows how many innocent people to that thing. We sacrificed three guilty people to stop it. I can live with that.”

“Yea... you're right,” I said, then suddenly broke out into a grin. “Did you see the way I kicked that guy in the balls?”

We kept each other's spirits up for the rest of the drive, letting the relief of our victory carry us along. I had to keep reminding myself that it was actually over. I still didn't quite believe it as we pulled into my driveway and went into my house. My wife looked surprised to see Chester there as we walked in.

“Hey, you brought Chester with you?”  
“Yea, I figured he'd want to stay with us for a little bit. He doesn't need to be on that farm all by himself like that. I hope that's okay.”

“Yea, of course. Did you two have a good trip?”

“Yea,” said Chester. “We had a blast.”

A few days passed and normality began to reassert itself, the happy equilibrium we all find after the danger and trauma has passed and we accept that life goes on. We started to trust it, actually believing we could move on from what he had experienced and live our lives again. That is, until we turned on the news one morning.

I walked into the living room with two cups of coffee, giving one to my brother as I took a seat on the couch and flipped on the television. We both sat stunned as we saw the familiar road leading to our grandfather's house. We sat in silence as the camera panned out to show the road ending abruptly in a steep drop. The entire town had vanished. In its place was a massive sink-hole. Barely discernible on the screen was what was sitting in the center of that hole. It was a gray spec, but we both knew what it was immediately. It was a little circle of stones with a symbol painted on it in black.",3,1740203837.0,scarystories,3,1.0,False

I hadn't kept up contact with my grandfather, not even calling him after his stroke. I had just been too busy to find the right time to do so. Someone I had loved and admired since I was a child was dead now and I hadn't spoken to him in years. That's why I was there at the farm that day. I would be damned if the same thing happened with my brother.

I got out of the car and walked up to him, feeling out of place in my khakis and white button-down shirt. He was dressed in flannel and blue jeans, looking every bit like a young version of Grandpa Silas.

“Hey Chester,” I said, hoping to see him smile as I got near.

That hope faded as I approached and saw him look confused, if not downright dismayed, by my sudden appearance.

“Daniel, what are you doing here?” he asked, and I couldn't help but hear some barely disguised reproach in his voice.

“I heard about Grandpa Silas and wanted to come by to pay my respects. Maybe catch up a little bit.”

I must have been tired from the road, because I thought Chester looked scared for just a moment.

“Of course, he's buried back in town. I'll go with you to his grave if you want.”

“Thanks. I'm sorry I haven't really been around...” I said, trying to think of where to begin repairing the rift that had come between us.

“It's okay. Life happens.”

“I know... It doesn't mean I don't want to be around more though,” I muttered awkwardly, not knowing exactly what to say and looking away from his tired gaze.

I felt his hand on my shoulder suddenly, making me look up into his face. It was a face worn and full of worry. I could see tears dancing at the corners of his eyes, barely held back by years of ingrained instincts to repress such strong emotions. We didn't cry or talk about feelings in my family, so when he pulled me into a hug in that moment, I was shocked.

“Ches, what's wrong, man?”

“A lot, Danny. A hell of a lot.”

We went inside and sat at the old kitchen table. Chester was making coffee while I talked his ear off.

“I can't believe this place still looks exactly the same as when we were kids. I wish I would have called Grandpa Silas, but when mom said he was recovering, I figured there'd be time. How have you been holding up, Ches?”

Chester didn't answer immediately. It was probably a full ten seconds before he did. I was just about to ask again when he cut through the silence in a voice that sounded like he hadn't slept in months.

“You remember that old well out there, Danny? The one that Grandpa Silas told us not to go around when we were kids?”

“Yea, I remember it. What about it?”

“There's something in that well.”

“You mean, like, water?” I chuckled, desperate to lighten the mood and wondering if Ches had gone crazy.

“No, Danny. Something bad. Grandpa told me about it right before he died. It's why I had to watch the farm. I'm supposed to feed it.”

“What do you mean 'feed it?'” I asked, becoming more and more convinced my brother had lost his mind.

“I'll show you. God knows I didn't believe it when the old man told me. You probably think I'm nuts, but everyone around here knows about it. Our great-grandfather put it there, whatever it is, and started feeding it. Grandpa told me to keep feeding it to make sure it doesn't hurt anyone. It's why he left me the farm.”

“Chester, I don't think you're nuts,” I lied. “I just think you're tired. You've been up here all by yourself for months now. You just need a break.”

“I'll tell you what, when we get back from visiting the cemetery tomorrow, I want you to stick around. I won't even say anything, you can see for yourself.”

I smiled, happy that my brother trusted me enough to ask for help. I didn't care if he was going crazy, it was the best chance I had to fix things between us.

“Of course, Ches. I'm here for you.”

Just saying those words felt like shrugging off a weight that had been crushing down on me for a long time. It felt relieving. I just wish that relief had lasted.

The next morning, Chester drove me into town in Grandpa Silas's pickup truck. The cemetery was built on a hillside overlooking a vast forest that stretched for as far as the eye could see. I may have lived in cities for the last decade, but I never did lose my love for the country. Being back in it after all those years made me feel free, like I could really breath again.

We walked up the long and winding path to a little tombstone jutting out of the ground. The grave was covered in flowers and wreaths, a testament to how much the people of the town respected him. It was no wonder, he had lived there his whole life. I stood at the foot of his grave with my brother and crouched down to lay my own bundle of flowers down, noticing an envelope laying partially covered by the wreaths and bouquets.

“What's this?” I asked picking it up.

“I don't know, open it,” said Chester with a shrug.

I pulled out the paper inside and saw it was a symbol, a circle with two curved lines drawn through it. It kind of resembled an eye. I shrugged and showed it to Ches.

“You know what it is?” I asked.

“No idea. Maybe some kind of weird local custom?”

I put the paper back in the envelope and sat it back down by the grave, feeling like it would be disrespectful to interfere with it any further. As I stood back up, I saw something move in the distant treeline. It vanished into the woods just as my eyes settled on it, but for a moment, I could of sworn there was a hooded figure standing out there watching us. I almost mentioned it to Ches, but stopped myself. He was under enough stress as it was and he didn't need me adding to it.

We drove back to the farm and Chester offered to make us lunch. We sat there eating ham sandwiches and drinking coffee, and for the first time since I had arrived, I saw Ches smile.

“You know, this reminds me of when we were kids,” he said.

“I know what you mean. It's like when grandma would make us sandwiches when we came to visit.”

“Yea, remember when-”

He was suddenly cut off by what sounded like a loud shriek that made me think someone was being killed outside. I jumped to my feet to rush out the door, but Ches caught my shoulder and held me back. The smile had vanished from his face completely.

“It's time for me to show you the well,” he whispered.

He led me outside to the side of the house where the cellar was. We walked down there to an old freezer in the corner. I didn't know what the hell was going on, but he grabbed a hunk of beef from it and started back outside in the direction of the well. The screaming sound got louder as we approached.

“What is that, Ches?” I asked, unable to keep the fear from my voice.

“It's Grandpa Silas's dirty secret. It's the well.”

We were standing in front of it at that point, the howl beginning to die away as he tossed the hunk of meat into the gaping hole in the ground. I stared at him in confusion, opening my mouth to inquire further, but he held up his hand to silence me.

A short second later, I heard the meaty sound of bone snapping underneath flesh echoing up from the well.

“What the fuck was that?” I asked Ches, feeling the blood draining from my cheeks.

“I wish I had a good answer for that. Whatever it is, it lives in the well and I have to feed it every day.”

“Or what?”

“Or it goes hunting.”

“What the hell does that mean?”

“I have no idea, but I know I don't ever want to find out,” Ches said, turning to walk back towards the farm house.

I started to follow him, but stopped. For just a moment, out in the endless fields of corn, I thought I saw something. It was just the hint of a shape, but it looked familiar. It looked like the same hooded figure I saw at the graveyard. I turned towards Chester, but saw he was already a good distance away. Besides, I was just jumpy from the weird shit happening with the well. It was probably just a neighbor who accidentally wandered on to the property or something. I looked back to where I saw the flash of movement in the corn field, but there was nothing there now besides the sea of green being rustled by invisible waves of wind.

When we were back in the house, I was already working on a plan. As Chester started making a pot of coffee, I found a pen and a notepad to start organizing what we knew so far.

“What are you writing down?” Ches asked me as he sat down a cup of coffee next to me and took a seat across the table.

“Okay, so here's what we know so far. There's something in that well that we can assume is dangerous. It can be contained there as long as we feed it meat every day. Am I right so far?”

“Yea, but there's some parts you don't know about.”

“Like what?”

“Well, on the harvest moon, it needs a human body.”

I stopped writing in my notepad and looked up at him. He shrugged and took a sip of coffee.

“What the fuck are you talking about?” I asked, hearing my own voice trembling with shock.

“Apparently, once a year, the coroner in town would set aside a corpse to be fed to the well. I had to do it a few months back, right before I got the news about grandpa. So you can jot that down too.”

I sat stunned for a moment, then, not knowing what else to do, wrote it down in the notepad.

“Okay, so you have to feed a body to it once a year.” I said, trying to ignore how crazy it sounded. “What else do we know?”

Ches leaned back for a moment, deep in thought.

“It can throw things back up the well,” he finally said.

“What do you mean?”

“When I first got here, I lowered a lantern down the well. It chewed it up and spat it back out with enough force to send it flying into the air. Scared the hell out of me,” he muttered, chuckling a little as he finished the thought.

“Okay, so it can spit things back up. Anything else you can think of?”

“Yea, the coroner said something to me. He said that it hunted like a trapdoor spider. So we can presume that whatever it is, it's an ambush predator. It digs holes and waits for prey. Oh, and it makes the corn grow.”

“It makes the corn grow?”

“Yea, he and grandpa kept saying 'feed the well and the well feeds us.' He said it's how they survived the dust bowl back in the day.”

“Okay, so there's something down there that hunts like a trapdoor spider, feeds on flesh, demands human bodies once a year, can spit things up through the well and makes the corn grow.”

“Yep. That's about the long and the short of it,” Chester said matter-of-factly, downing the rest of his coffee.

I leaned back in my chair, digesting all the information while Chester stared at me. I found myself hoping that if he was crazy, it wasn't infectious. Then, I considered the alternative and decided being crazy would be better. I looked over the notes I had written and back up to him, finally deciding to believe this was all really happening.

“I think we need to kill this thing,” I finally said.

“I thought about that, but what if we just piss it off? I'm sure we wouldn't be the first ones to try.”

“What the hell else can we do, Ches?”

“We feed it. We feed it and hope it never gets out.”

We didn't talk much for the rest of the night. I turned in early, sleeping in one of the spare bedrooms. It took me a long time to finally drift off. I kept questioning my sanity and trying to come to a logical explanation for all this. I fell asleep without ever arriving at an answer.

The next day, I stood over the well. It was early, the sun barely peaking over the horizon to begin the day. I stared down into its depths, pushing against the futility of my attempt to discern what the hell was down there. I thought of my brother, trapped alone with this thing for months and slowly losing his mind. I thought of the people that had disappeared into the darkness of that maw. I thought of my wife, of my grandfather, my mother. Finally, I thought of how angry I was that the thing was hurting my family.

“Damn you!” I yelled into the dark pit. “Why the hell do you exist?! Why can't you just die of old age already!”

I picked up one of the loose stones from the ring bordering it and threw it down into the well with all my might. I expected to hear a dull thunk of stone hitting the bottom, but instead, I heard laughter. It was deep and full of bass, causing my chest to vibrate with each guffaw.

“Can you understand me?” I heard myself say in disbelief.

In response, the thing just laughed harder. Finally, as the laughter began to quiet, I heard a sound that took my brain a moment to realize I was hearing a single word stretched into unnatural lengths.

“Huuuuuuuuuunnnnngggggrrrryyyyyyyyy...”

That's when Chester threw me to the ground. I hadn't even heard him come up behind me. The first I knew of his presence was the two hands that had gripped my shoulders and threw me sideways.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” he whispered from above me.

I said nothing, just stared at the ground. I didn't know what to say, so I just stood up and began walking back to the house. Chester followed me without a word. I had thought he was angry with me, but when we got inside, he pulled me into a hug.

“Don't go near that thing anymore, Danny. Just don't. Just go home to your wife, to mom. Just go home.”

“I can't let it get you either, Ches. We have to stop it!” I said, feeling tears pool in my eyes. “We have to kill it!”

“... okay,” he finally whispered. “We'll kill it.”

I looked at him in relief, a smile spreading across my face despite my desperate tears.

“It's about damn time!”

Across the house was the old barn our grandfather had used to store corn and tools, as well as shelter the sheep and cows and where Chester and I had played as children. He pulled open the large doors and pointed inside. There in the gloom of that barn, with dust motes dancing in the meager rays of light penetrating the interior, was a pile of sacks near the back.

“What am I looking at Ches?”

“Fertilizer, Danny. Ammonium nitrate fertilizer. The same stuff used in the Oklahoma City bombing. And there's a shit load of it.”

“What the hell are we going to do with that?” I asked.

“We're going to feed the well.”

Over the next two days, I fed the well while Chester worked in the barn on the bomb. He started by scooping the powder into a coffee grinder, then pouring the fine dust into an old feeding trough. In the meantime, I shot one of the cows and went about the process of cleaning it. When I was done, the legless, skinless and headless body of the beast was laying on the barn floor next to him.

He was looking different than when I had first seen him. Originally, he had looked resigned. More than that, he had looked defeated. However, as he sat there in the barn and meticulously went about the work of creating our weapon, he looked determined. He looked more like the Chester I remembered.

On the second day, I went out to feed the well and stopped in my tracks. Someone had drawn that same symbol of the eye shape on the stones in black paint. I tossed the hunk of meat into the hole and went running back to Chester. I found him in the barn kneeling over the carcass of the cow we had slaughtered earlier, stuffing the body cavity with white powder. He looked up as I came in, standing as he saw the look on my face.

A short while later, we were both standing by the well and looking at the symbol.

“What the hell do you think it means?” he asked me.

“I got no idea, but it's the same thing we saw at grandpa's grave.”

“Someone is trying to send us a message,” he muttered to me, then spun around, yelling into the corn fields stretching endlessly around us. “It's too bad they don't know how to speak fucking English!”

Suddenly, my eyes widened in realization.

“Or they're trying to distract us...”

Chester looked at me with an expression of alarm before breaking into a sprint. We ran back to the barn, just in time to see a group of people in dark hoods dragging the dead cow towards a waiting pickup truck in the drive way.

“Hey! Hey stop!” I yelled, pulling ahead of Ches.

I was almost on them when I was thrown down to the ground by someone from behind.

“That's enough, you boys are done,” said the man looming over me. I could see the same symbol that had been on the well stitched in white on the front of his hooded jacket, but my eye didn't focus on it long. It was more concerned with the gun in the man's hand.

“You and your brother had one job! One fucking job! Just feed the damn well and it feeds us!” he screamed at me, cocking back the hammer of the pistol as he did so. “Do you know how much we rely on the corn produced here? You're going to ruin more than a century worth of hard work just because you two are cowards!”

I glanced over to the house as I heard feet pounding on the wood porch and saw two more of the hooded people running through the open door of our late grandfather. In that moment, I didn't think in words. I thought of my wife's face, Chester's weary eyes, my mom's hugs. I was certain I was going to die. I closed my eyes and tried to breath normally, determined to find some measure of peace in the moment before my death, and waited for the end.

I flinched as I heard the blast of a gun, but opened my eyes when I realized it had come from the house. My eyes were glued to the door as one of the hooded men came sprinting through it, only to fly forward as a second blast echoed through the sea of corn around us. The man standing over me pointed the gun at the doorway, taking aim.

I used to play football back in High School. Chester would come to all my games, even though he clearly didn't care about sports at all. He'd mostly sit in the bleachers, talking to friends and ignoring what was happening on the field. The only time he paid attention was when the special team would come out to kick the ball. That's when he'd cheer for me, always the loudest one in the crowd. Every time I heard him cheer like that for me, I'd wind up and kick that damn ball as hard as I could.

I put one foot on the ground to act as my ballast and kicked upwards with every bit of strength I had, right into the gun wielding man's groin. I felt a burst of pain erupt from my ankle as it crashed into flesh. The man immediately dropped the gun and made a strange gasping sound as Chester sprinted out onto the porch, shotgun in hand.

I spun my body on the ground, rolling over and away from the man who was now retching with the agony of having his testicles crushed, looking up again just in time to see Chester turn the man's face into a bloody mess of torn flesh and buckshot.

I laid there breathing hard as Chester walked over to me. He held out a hand and I took it, putting all my weight on my uninjured foot as I stood up. We turned and watched the pickup truck speed off down the highway. I looked over at the dead man next to me in awe.

“That might be one of the most painful deaths imaginable,” I said in shock.

I looked back up in time to see the truck disappear around the corner, our cow-bomb going with it.

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.

“The locals. That was the coroner there,” he said, giving the body next to us a nudge with his foot. “Pretty sure that one over there was the sheriff.”

“So... what now?” I asked.

Chester smiled and pointed at the barn.

“We go get the well's last meal ready.”

“But they took the cow...”

“Yea, a cow with hardly any ammonium nitrate in it. I'd only just started filling it. Besides, we have something better than a cow now,” he said, jerking his thumb at the coroner's dead body next to us.

It was probably one of the most disgusting things I've ever done, but we prepared the body the same way we did the cow. We did the same to the other two he killed in the farm house and started stuffing them with powder. I sacrificed my cell phone to make the detonator and crammed it into the bloody neck hole of one of the bodies. We tied the three headless torsos together with baling wire stepped back to admire our handiwork.

“Well... there's a sight I'll never be able to get out of my mind...” I murmured.

We dragged the disgusting bomb over to the foot of the well. As we approached, the symbol was still clear on the ring of stones.

“Hey, Ches, I just figured out what that symbol is.”

Chester looked up at me, confused.

“What do you mean?”

“I thought it was a circle with an eye in the middle, but it isn't. It's a mouth. It's supposed to be the well.”

He stared at it for a while.

“Do you think Grandpa Silas was part of them?”

“I don't know. I hope he wasn't. I guess it doesn't matter anymore,” I said.

We sat there in silence, listening to the wind whisper over the fields.

“Thanks for coming, Danny. I'm glad you did.”

“I am too. So, what now?”

“We do what Grandpa Silas told us to do. It's time to feed the well.”

We hefted the mass of flesh on top of the wall of stones and balanced it there. We gave each other a look and dropped it in.

We jogged back to the house, my ankle throbbing all the while, and got into my car. Chester pulled out his cell phone and handed it to me.

“Hey, can you do me a favor and call my brother? I haven't called him in a while and I can't remember his number.”

I grinned and punched it in, hitting the gas and handing the phone back to Ches as I pressed down on the pedal.

“There's the number. You should call though, I got a feeling he's been waiting to hear from you for a while.”

We got onto the road and I punched it as hard as I could. Chester hit the call button and the sky behind us erupted into an orange ball of fury. The blast shook the car so violently that I swerved, but managed to correct it. Chester shrugged and looked up at me.

“Hope that worked.”

We drove as hard and fast as we could until the sun began sinking down beneath the distant horizon. We had driven in silence for an hour. Finally, I spoke up.

“We killed three people, Ches. We butchered them too.”

“They were trying to kill us, Danny. They sacrificed God knows how many innocent people to that thing. We sacrificed three guilty people to stop it. I can live with that.”

“Yea... you're right,” I said, then suddenly broke out into a grin. “Did you see the way I kicked that guy in the balls?”

We kept each other's spirits up for the rest of the drive, letting the relief of our victory carry us along. I had to keep reminding myself that it was actually over. I still didn't quite believe it as we pulled into my driveway and went into my house. My wife looked surprised to see Chester there as we walked in.

“Hey, you brought Chester with you?”  
“Yea, I figured he'd want to stay with us for a little bit. He doesn't need to be on that farm all by himself like that. I hope that's okay.”

“Yea, of course. Did you two have a good trip?”

“Yea,” said Chester. “We had a blast.”

A few days passed and normality began to reassert itself, the happy equilibrium we all find after the danger and trauma has passed and we accept that life goes on. We started to trust it, actually believing we could move on from what he had experienced and live our lives again. That is, until we turned on the news one morning.

I walked into the living room with two cups of coffee, giving one to my brother as I took a seat on the couch and flipped on the television. We both sat stunned as we saw the familiar road leading to our grandfather's house. We sat in silence as the camera panned out to show the road ending abruptly in a steep drop. The entire town had vanished. In its place was a massive sink-hole. Barely discernible on the screen was what was sitting in the center of that hole. It was a gray spec, but we both knew what it was immediately. It was a little circle of stones with a symbol painted on it in black.",1,1740203783.0,u_Mother-Effective-797,0,1.0,False

1ivbu1i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ivbu1i,Trying the first cake I bought from Yunnan,"Follow up to the below :

https://www.reddit.com/r/puer/s/9Rzqynj2rl

Breaking into my purchase from Yunnan and trying the brew for the first time.

Authenticity, I’m too new to this to know one way or another and to me it’s not exactly that critical. I have nothing to benchmarked it against so it’s really down to how enjoyable it is for me to want to continue drinking it. 

Just sharing my first hand opinion after experiencing the brew. 

The cake is very compact and not easy to break even with the tea pick. Maybe I’m just doing it wrong but it’s not big whole tea leaf, looks more like loose leaf to me. 

Maybe that’s why it’s not exceedingly expensive like the other LBZ out there as it’s a secondary product from the top grades big leaf LBZ.

Brew it with a tea bag as there’s a lotta crumps. Hot water gets dark really fast, less than a min. 

Smell wise, to my insensitive nose from decades of smoking. Just normal tea smell with  nothing too distinctive. 

From drinking, it’s as I remembered when I tried it at the tea shop. Very smooth, not bitter and doesn’t leave any after taste. There’s a very slight tinge of sweetness and how your mouth feels lubricated upon drinking milk. Sounds weird but that’s the best way I know how to describe it. Quench your thirst much better than water. 

You still get the same colour tea from the 2nd brew and I’m assuming it’ll good till 6-7th brew. 

Overall, it’s an enjoyable tea and hopefully it helps with curing my 2nd coffee of the day addiction.

Literally all five of these have less than ten blanks left to fill before I've completed them. Heck, in the Nolan Ranking's case, there's only one blank left.

Here's how much of each ranking OST I've figured out so far:

* Christopher Nolan Ranking OST: 92% (11/12)
* George Miller Ranking OST: 87% complete (13/15)
* Wes Anderson Ranking OST: 82% complete (9/11)
* James Cameron Ranking OST: 80% complete (8/10)
* Steven Spielberg Ranking OST: 76% complete (28/37)

And of course, as always, if you know the names of any background songs that I don't (represnted by the question marks), please tell me. I really appreciate it. Now onto the five lists.

1ivbrzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ivbrzo/the_grinning_beast_a_sisters_account/,The Grinning Beast: A Sister's Account,"

I wasn’t expecting to hear from Sarah. We hadn’t talked much in the last few months—not because we were fighting or anything, just life getting in the way. She’d moved into that house a while back, and I figured she was busy settling in. When I saw her name pop up on my missed calls list, I thought it was just one of her usual check-ins.  

But when I listened to the voicemail, something about her tone unsettled me.  

**Day 1: The First Voicemail**
*""Hey, Em! It’s me. Just wanted to call and catch up—I know it’s been a while. Anyway, something weird happened last night. I woke up around 2 AM because I heard this scratching noise on my window. When I checked, there were these claw marks on the glass! Like, actual scratches. I thought maybe it was raccoons or something, but… I don’t know. It didn’t look like anything an animal would do.""*  

*""Oh, and get this—when I looked outside, I swear I saw someone standing by the tree line. Just this tall figure, kind of hunched over? But when I turned on the porch light, they were gone. Probably just my imagination, right? Anyway, call me back when you get this. Love you!""*  

At first, I laughed a little under my breath—Sarah always had a flair for the dramatic. She could turn a creaky floorboard into a ghost story if you let her. But as I replayed the message, something about it didn’t sit right with me. She didn’t sound scared exactly, but there was an edge to her voice—a nervousness she was trying to hide.  

I called her back that evening after work but got no answer. That wasn’t unusual for Sarah; she’d always been terrible at keeping her phone nearby. Still, I made a mental note to try again the next day.


The second voicemail came late that night—around 11:30 PM. Her voice was different this time: nervous but still trying to sound rational.


**Day 2: The Second Voicemail**  
*""Hey, Em. So… remember how I told you about those claw marks? Well, it happened again last night. Same time—around 2 AM—but this time, the scratches were on my *bedroom window*. And… okay, this is going to sound crazy, but I saw that figure again. It was closer this time—standing right outside the fence. I couldn’t see its face or anything, but it was tall… like *really* tall. And its arms were way too long for its body.""*  

*""I’m probably just freaking myself out over nothing. Maybe it’s some weirdo messing with me? Anyway, just wanted to let you know in case… well, in case something happens. Call me back when you can.""*  

Her words sent a chill down my spine. What did she mean by “in case something happens”? That wasn’t like Sarah at all—she wasn’t one to jump to conclusions or let her imagination run wild.  

I called her back immediately after hearing the message but got no response again. This time, though, it bothered me more than it should have.


The next voicemail came in at 3 AM—a frantic call that jolted me awake when my phone buzzed on my nightstand.


**Day 3: The Third Voicemail**
*""Emily! Oh my God, please call me back as soon as you get this! It was outside my house tonight—*right outside*! I was in bed when I heard scratching at the front door. At first, I thought it was the wind or something, but then it started knocking. Not like a person knocking—it was slow and uneven, like claws tapping against the wood.""*  

*""I didn’t open it—I swear I didn’t—but when I looked through the peephole… it was there. Just standing there on the porch with this huge grin on its face. Its teeth were so sharp… and its eyes… oh God, its eyes were completely black. It just stood there staring at me for what felt like hours before it walked away.""*  

*""I don’t know what to do! Please call me back!""*  

Hearing her describe that thing made my stomach turn over itself. A grin? Black eyes? What kind of person—or thing—was she describing? My first instinct was to drive out to her house immediately and check on her myself… but something stopped me: fear.

What if whatever she saw was still there?

  
The next voicemail came in at 3 AM again—the same time as before—and this one chilled me to my core.


**Day 4: The Fourth Voicemail**
*""Emily! It’s inside the house! Oh God… oh God… how did it get in? I locked all the doors and windows—I swear I did—but when I woke up tonight, it was standing at the foot of my bed.""*  

*""It didn’t move—it just stood there grinning at me with that horrible smile. And then it whispered my name… in *your voice*. How does it know your voice?! It kept saying things like ‘Come with me’ and ‘You’re next.’""*  

*""I don’t know what to do anymore—I can’t sleep; I can’t eat; it’s always watching me! Please help me!""*  

Her voice cracked halfway through the message like she was barely holding herself together—and honestly? Neither was I.

How could something *inside her house* know *my voice*? Was she hallucinating? Losing her mind? Or worse—was everything she said real?


This voicemail broke me.


 **Day 5: The Fifth Voicemail**
*""Hi, Em. It’s me again… but you probably already knew that.""*  

*""I think I understand now what it wants. It’s not trying to hurt me—it’s trying to *replace me*. Every time I look in the mirror now, my reflection doesn’t match what I’m doing. Sometimes it smiles when I’m not smiling… or moves when I’m standing still.""*  

*""And my grin—it’s getting wider every day. My cheeks hurt from how much they stretch now. My teeth feel sharper too—like they’re growing into points.""*  

*""I don’t think there’s anything left of me anymore. Whatever that thing is… whatever *I’m becoming*... it’s almost finished.""*  

*""Don’t come here, Em. Stay away from me.""*

Her voice sounded hollow—like she’d already given up.


 
**Day 6: The Final Message** 
The last voicemail came early in the morning—just static at first with faint scratching sounds in the background.

Then Sarah whispered: *“It’s here.”*

There was a long pause before another voice spoke—a distorted version of Sarah’s own voice: *“I’m ready.”*

The line went dead.

It’s been weeks since I last heard Sarah’s voice. Weeks since I drove out to her house, hoping—praying—that I’d find her there, safe, and that all of this had been some kind of misunderstanding. A bad dream. A mistake.

But it wasn’t.

Her car was still in the driveway, parked neatly where she always left it. The front door was unlocked, swinging open with a faint creak when I pushed it. Inside, everything was exactly how she’d left it: her favorite blanket draped over the couch, a half-empty coffee mug on the kitchen counter, her phone sitting on the nightstand next to her bed. It was like she’d just stepped out for a moment and would be back any second.

But she wasn’t.

I searched every room, calling her name over and over again until my throat felt raw. There was no sign of her—no blood, no struggle, no footprints leading away from the house. Nothing. It was as if she had simply vanished into thin air.

Except for the mirrors.

Every single mirror in the house—bathroom, bedroom, hallway—was covered in deep scratches. Long, jagged claw marks that crisscrossed the glass in chaotic patterns. Some of them were so deep that pieces of the mirror had shattered onto the floor. But what disturbed me most was what I saw when I looked into them.

Or rather, what I didn’t see.

My reflection wasn’t… right. It was subtle at first—just a slight delay in my movements or a flicker of something in the corner of my eye. But the longer I stared, the more wrong it became. My reflection’s grin stretched wider than it should have, its teeth sharper than mine could ever be. Its eyes seemed darker too—empty pits that swallowed the light around them.

I ran out of that house as fast as I could and haven’t been back since.

But it didn’t end there.

At first, I thought I was imagining things. The faint scratching sounds at my bedroom window late at night. The feeling of being watched when I walked past darkened hallways or glanced into reflective surfaces. I told myself it was just paranoia—that my mind was playing tricks on me after everything that happened with Sarah.

But then I started seeing it.

The figure Sarah described—the tall, hunched thing with impossibly long arms and that horrible grin—it’s here now. Watching me from the shadows just like it watched her. Sometimes it stands outside my window at night, its black eyes staring straight through me as if it knows every thought in my head. Other times, I catch glimpses of it in mirrors or reflections: standing behind me when no one else is there or grinning at me from across the room when I turn away.

I’ve started hearing its voice too—soft whispers in the dead of night that sound like Sarah’s but… wrong somehow. Distorted. Twisted. It calls my name over and over again, telling me to “come closer” or “let it in.” Sometimes it laughs—a low, guttural sound that makes my skin crawl.

I’ve tried ignoring it, pretending it isn’t real—but every day, it gets harder to fight. My reflection has started moving on its own now: smiling when I’m not smiling or tilting its head at angles that make my neck ache just looking at them. And my grin… oh God… my grin is getting wider too.

It hurts to smile this much—to feel my cheeks stretch and crack like they’re being pulled apart by invisible hands. My teeth feel sharper every day; sometimes they cut into my lips without warning, leaving trails of blood that taste too sweet to be mine.

I think… I think Sarah was right. It doesn’t want to kill me—it wants to *replace* me.

This will probably be my last entry—my last chance to warn anyone who finds this before it’s too late. If you’re reading this… if you hear scratching at your window or see something grinning at you from the corner of your eye… don’t look at it. Don’t let it in.

And whatever you do… don’t smile back.

*The scratching has started again.*  

*It’s here.*

*And this time…*  

*I think I’m ready.*

That used to mean missing sunrises and drinking coffee to barely function. Now it means this: waking well before sunrise with peace, energy, and a calm heartbeat/mind. It means greeting the sunrise in the ocean. It means remembering everything and giving my full effort/attention to making memories with my aging parents. It means having patience for my mom whose dementia is worsening each visit. It means making new friends at the coffee shop. It means biking 65 miles in 3 days as if it were a walk in the park.

1ivbpok,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1ivbpok/found_out_the_girl_i_liked_outright_lied_to_me/,Found out the girl I liked outright lied to me,"So, here’s the deal. I used to have a crush on a girl in my office. She joined our team six months ago as a fresh grad, and I was her mentor. We worked together for three months, and I taught her all about the company, how to work efficiently, and how it all leads to positive outcomes. We hung out a lot during that time, and I learned all about her school and college life, her personality, and her daily routine. We became really close to each other.

On the other hand, there’s another guy in my team who’s also a grad from the same college as her. He’s 11 months senior to me and two years senior to her (we’re all the same age). I don’t have any beef with him because I know he’s a great guy, and we’ve been working together for the past year and a half. He even brings his bike to the office and makes some cool vlogs.

Now, here’s the thing. A month ago, I started noticing her coming to work late. Before 2025, she was always on time. A few weeks later, I saw her leaving the office with the guy on his bike when I had to stay back late to finish some work. I thought it was just a one-time thing, and there wouldn’t be any rickshaws or buses available, so maybe he was giving her a ride home. But guess what? This pattern kept going for a whole month! She even stopped her work when he was leaving for home so she could hang out with him.

And that’s not all! I also noticed a few other things: she was always happy to finish his lunch when he didn’t want to eat it, she helped him clean his desk during office closing hours, and I bet she even read the book he recommended. Recently, I found out that both of them started coming to the office together, way later than the reporting time. 

I would have brushed off all these coincidences until she posted an Instagram story about visiting a cafe. I asked her for the cafe’s address and asked if he was with her at that time. She totally lied, saying the location was at place A (not mentioning the actual place, as I don’t want to risk her location). But when I checked it on Google, the location was indeed at place B. When I asked her about it the next day, she still defended her answer, giving another excuse that the photo was taken a long time ago and that she had gone with her mom. But I noticed a few more details that I hadn’t mentioned to her.

The first detail was that the background of the image matched exactly that of place B, including the seats, photos, walls, and everything. But the most crucial detail was that a portion of the guy’s bike helmet was visible in the photo. It was precisely the same helmet he brings to the office.

Now, after all this, I felt betrayed. Betrayed by the fact that the girl I like could outright lie to me. To make matters worse, she was even defending her lie after being close to me for almost six months, even when I had incriminating evidence against her. This incident made me lose my trust in her, even when she might think nothing’s wrong with the both of us. 

How far can someone go to lie about something that could have been brushed off as a harmless coffee date, and why?

TLDR:- Girl adds Insta story, OP asks for location and person she was with, girl lies, OP finds out the truth, Girl defends her lie with another lie, OP feels betrayed.

Idk if these symptoms occurred because of the brain lesions OR SE's from the rads.  But I'm really kinda miserable with some of them. I heard some MAY go away on their own once the brain rests, but in the meanwhile, damn it, it's a lot.

Thick, mucusy lining in mouth, no matter how much I brush or rinse. Using a baking soda toothpaste to neutralize some of it, and it helps a TINY amount?  Would you all recommend a specific mouth wash???? Along with that area, the right side of my tongue, throat is swollen and sore.

Along with that area, I lost ALL taste about a week and a half back. ALL OF IT. I''m a foodie, coffee lover (grind my own beans, etc), and I""ve been starving because of the steroids.

We are the frozen hotdog chunks stowed away in the freezer left from some abandoned culinary endeavor undertaken by a store clerk (“give up your dreams and just flip the damn burgers”). If I squint, I can see the diner for everything it used to be, instead of what it is now. It’s an eerie spectacle. I see this in tandem with visions of the person I used to be before I became your sacrificial lamb. I see it in tandem with the version of you I created in my head, the one I had in my heart when I first met you. A part of me died when that kind, good-hearted version of you died. Or, I guess it never truly lived. It is undead, sucking the life out of me. It is a vampire. 

I’m the loudest at this club called heartbreak. I have no right to be - everyone here has been through so much. The thing we all have in common is that the grooves in our hearts run so deep we cannot patch them up or let them go. Some were put here by friends. Some by family. Some by boyfriends or girlfriends or other romantic entanglements. Everyone has a story. But I’m dramatic, and I’m crass, and I’m willing to speak. So they let me. I talk and talk and scream until my lungs are sore and all the tears are gone from my eyes. I slur your name until the early hours of the morning. I pretend I’m screaming into your black void, and I will receive no response. I know that. I keep doing it. 

I’m at home in this club called heartbreak, where we sit around in booths far too small for comfort and taste the ghost of strawberry milkshakes past which are far too sweet for our liking. Country music blares on a muffled radio - no one can figure out where it’s located. When the diner closed, no one ever thought to tell the waitress how to turn it off (she insists we just call her our waitress - no names). Waylon sings about the pain of his own life (the song may as well be called ""Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Country Music Musicians”), Willie sings about the blue eyes he left alone to cry in the rain. As Townes Van Zandt cries out about the pain of losing a friend and watching time pass, the hurt in our own hearts begins to heal. That’s what country music is for. That’s what heartbreak club is for. 

I’m never really going to leave this club called heartbreak. Once you’re in, you’re a member for life - there’s a reason the neon sign outside the diner still bids everyone welcome in that off-putting, vaguely unnatural 1950s lighting. It would be unfair of me to just blame you for putting me here, though you don’t deserve “fair” treatment. It would be disingenuous and a lie to solely blame you, though, so I will tell the truth. It's her. It’s him. It’s you. You are all still running around my head, taunting me and kicking me when I’m down. Only when I’m down. I would like to say I’ve never given any of you a second thought since those days, because God knows you haven’t given me the decency of one. But I wouldn’t be here if that were true. I wouldn’t be looking at the dead linoleum checkered floors of the diner. I wouldn’t be listening to Angela talk about how her deadbeat, good-for-nothing boyfriend showed up to her senior prom with the girl he told her not to worry about…while they were still together! I feel sorry for her. I feel the tears rushing down her face. I feel all of her frustration, her anger. It is mine. It is all of ours. 

I’m always there for the meetings of this club called heartbreak. I look at the teal and white patterned floors and the red plastic swivel chairs with holes in them from use around a drab counter. Without loyal patrons, all that’s left to see is an altar where the downtrodden go to worship. Much like the people beside me who will always curse the names of people like you who left them in the cold, there will always be a part of me that hates you. I hate myself for that. I was always taught to be the kind of girl who never lets things weigh her fragile heart down. Your heart can break, but not for long. I hate you for making me the kind of girl who can’t let go, still grasping her heart like a bloody and cracked hand around a straw. Hours, days, months, years later I still have my own blood dripping from my hands (why hasn’t it dried? I have become Lady Macbeth.). I start to hate you for making me hate myself. I stay up for long nights and think up long fights wallowing in this spiral of hate while it consumes my heart, piece by broken piece. Cliche. A broken heart? Well, it suits you - cartoon, predictable villain you are. Actually, calling you a cartoon villain is insulting to cartoon villains. At least they have cool one-liners. At least they have the possibility of a redemption arc. 

I’m a star at this club called heartbreak. People like me there - they smile when they see me walk in, the waitress frowns when I say I have to be getting home. I didn’t know people did that. I didn’t know there was a place in this world, however lead paint and out of date decor filled, that wanted me. Or, maybe I did, and you made me forget that I knew. We’re not friends there - we don’t laugh, we don’t have fun - but we understand each other. We’ve seen each other cry, and it’s hard to imagine a much deeper bond than that. It’s almost comical to think about what this place was before. At one point, it was full of reckless high school students paying twenty cents for a root beer float, people on their way to work grabbing a coffee and eggs, theater kids performing opening numbers for the staff after coming from their opening show. I almost feel like we’re doing it a disservice - what was once filled with so much love and light now has enough darkness to blanket the world. But maybe now the building can join heartbreak club. Maybe now the walls won’t have to listen because they’ve talked. 

You’re part of a club called heartbreakers - you meet on Saturdays in a crowded 80s mall. The faux modernity of the still-functioning mall speaks to the facade of love most of you have put on. Instead of the dull lights of the diner, you get flashy red and blue signs. You get synthy music about being in love. You get adoration. You get happiness. You get to shop. I’ll bet you get ice cream and soda in plastic cups with that dark blue background and the Pepsi logo on them. I’ll bet you get a plate of fries and a hotdog and you carry it in one of those stupid “thank you” take out bags. I’ll bet you chat with your fake friends with shopping bags all along your arm. I’d wish you a quick descent into madness, but heartbreak club has taught me better than that. Does heartbreakers club? I wonder what you talk about - do you talk their ears off about how you did right by me the whole time? How I was the bitch for abandoning you? I’d never know because I have never been like you one day in my life. And that is the one thing I can be proud of about myself. So I’ll take my abandoned diner, you take your 1980s mall. I’ll take my heartbreak, and I’ll let you take the fall.

While the show dealt with a number of serious issues (not always in the best way, but they *tried*), there are scenes that pop up where I just can’t help but laugh, or see a post on this sub where I’ve laughed not noticing how hilarious it really is, even if it’s something you shouldn’t be laughing about…

For me, the #1 is the infamous *“Reseda”* comment made by Felice to Ray when he’s meeting the Martins for the first time followed by…

-Steves confused & frightened behavior when he realizes he’s in a gay coffee house with Brandon

-Dylan’s response to John Sears asking what frat he’s pledging to:  “Crack House.”

-David’s inability to tie his shoes properly resulting from falling off a cliff in Hawaii and left in a ditch

- Dave Koz concert for Kelly’s 21st bday (there aren’t enough words for this one)

Ok for context there is actually two MOH  ( fake names carol and sam) call me (Tea) 
The bridesmaid stuff -planning our part in the Bachelorette, getting the dresses, shoes, and thw rest we need to get for our brides wedding and events in January. We get told it's a split Bachelorette/bachelor party 🥳  love it. Location decided in march i believe and split is like 80... well some people drops out so now it's like 120. We'll some of the bridal party dropped so now it's 180. Honestly it's fine but as we are paying for this what is required to pay for keeps changing as for the Bachelorette trip and the wedding. I ASKED for just a list of what the full expectations were for each of us to pay for - carol came across like I was being difficult even though every month is a new thing and we should be budgeting ( how do I know what to budget for if I don't know what I'm exspected to pay for) 

So now there is 3 of us going due to this and the bride.  Honestly everything seeeemed  fine, we agreed we would split cost at the end so  
We got groceries, I paid for the alcohol, sam paid for one of the events for all of us, we did a second groceries run for everyone in the house ( the guys too), split the cost of dinners for the bride and breakfast/coffee. - I'm not going to get into the issue that happened in the trip but Carol was never happy unless she was on the brides side. This is a separate story and I can get into it if request -  according to Carol 
I owed her 166
Sam = 165
And her half was 165
This was with her ""discounts"" for the alcohol I spent, her event ticket for Sam, and her other discounts to make it cheaper for us.
 The first grocery bill split is 
Sam = 33
Me = 17
Carol = 34
The total was 151
The other grocery store was a total of 230 ( carol says) so 77 each
the gas she spent on the trip ( we carpooled) total she said was like 100 so 33 each
Call me crazy but for me I get 127 not 166
Now i had also already put 20 on gas and spent 88 on Liquor not including the nessary items for the Bachelorette coctail items
Mind you sam and I keep asking for just the break down of how she's getting the amount she is. I DONT HAVE A PEOBLEM PAYING FOR MY HALF.... buttt I have a problem with blindly paying someone I don't know and had been sly all weekend. 
Ok so now we get the details finally
She's adding in an event we went to and she offered to pay for the bride 30 ( we ate now splitting it) 
The appetizers we split 12
The team shirts the bride ordered 50
And she took it apon herself to add in the food a family membered covered and said he got the tab...( this was already covered with thr family memeber) 
Ok so now we have a final offer for me to pay 135 and sam pays 151
My argument at this point is Whyyy isn't it adding up ( is it adding up to you) 
Now i hear about how she's done us a favor with this price... I ask how 
Her alcohol discounts was $14 - reason we were not splitting the full price is because I took home the rest of the bottles not used. We did drink at least 3 bottles though- $42 ( still, ok I understand)
So sam... Sam brings up that carol took home the rest of the unused food. So where is our discounts for that and the champagne bottle she took. Sam has just been on a SHOW ME THE RECIPTS  and has been so nice this whole time and this has been the first sassy thing she had said and I died... ( I got $55 groceries she took home)
Skip some things but she says she has added a discount for groceries soa $50 in discounts. I said there's no way there was discounts 
Carols new argument is it's split based on her BANK STATEMENT of 600 something
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TOTAL YOU SPEND ( or am I wrong) 
I'll let you add up just splitting 600 3 ways and  our discounts... still does not match up
 By the end of it 
I got sam at 100, Carol at 169 and me at 36
Sam sent 100 I sent 125
( also the gas she spent went up from 98 to 140 by this point)

1ivbiu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ivbiu7/anyone_beat_sibo_with_keto/,Anyone beat SIBO with keto?,"I followed a keto diet for two years, and despite my family and friends warning me about how “unhealthy” cheese and meat were, I lost 70 pounds, had an A1C of 4.9, and my white blood cell count were double compared to now.

After switching back to a regular diet, things started falling apart:

* 1 year later → Developed a gluten intolerance
* Another year later → Started having FODMAP issues
* 2024 → Now have a severe egg intolerance
* Recently, a food sensitivity test also showed acetic acid (coffee & vinegar) is a big issue

Just before Christmas, I realized I had zero energy, constant bloating, and always felt awful after eating. My doctor scheduled a gastro/colonoscopy—both came back negative. He then recommended a lactose test (negative) and a SIBO test (also negative).

However, the SIBO test did reveal excess bacteria producing too much hydrogen sulfide, which explains my symptoms:  
\-Feeling constipated & brain fog  
\-Uncomfortable fullness after meals (not including breakfast)  
\-Unformed gas that won’t pass

One of the naturopathic ways to get rid of SIBO (excess bad bacteria in the small intestine) is to avoid or limit carbs. Given how great I felt on keto before, I told my doctor that if the tests keep coming back negative, I might just go back on keto since I had zero issues for two years eating large meals.

* The majority, if not all, of the song I'm looking for was sung by a male singer.
* The musical had certain songs that were only piano, with the title being, or similar to, the names of famous compositions.
* The male sings was likely a composer or writer of some sort, mentioning mail (fan mail I believe).

These are the things I think are true, though I don't know for sure:

* The male mentions time multiple times in the song (i.e. doing something at noon,  waiting until 1 pm, etc.).
* There is a female partner(?) mentioned in the song who, at the beginning, leaves for work and is mentioned to come home toward the end (6p.m., I think). 
* I believe it was mentioned in the song that he drank more than one cup of coffee and listened to music on a record, though I am unsure. It could've also been mentioned that there was ""dust coming in an open window"".
* I vaguely remember the song being like 7 minutes long, but I could be totally wrong about that.
* The cover may have (though it is VERY unlikely) been blue or yellow mainly, or had those two colors incorporated into the cover art, and I don't remember any people being on the cover. 

Any help you can provide in getting me reunited with this song and musical is greatly appreciated, it's been driving me insane that I can't remember the song. ",3,1740201024.0,tipofmytongue,4,1.0,False
1ivb8u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1ivb8u4/tips_on_working_through_3_issues/,Tips On Working Through 3 Issues,"I'm 3 weeks into fasting and it's been going really well. Lost about 5kg (down from 104kg) in the 3 weeks. I've worked up to doing mostly 23ish hour fasts this week with dinner being my only meal. I drink only water and black coffee and some days one low-carb sugar free electrolyte drink (<1g of carbs). I also take a tablet of Magnesium Glycinate before bed. All has been going well except for 3 issues that I'm looking for any tips with.

  
1: Peeing A Lot - Particularly in the afternoons I need to pee a lot. Sometimes I can't go more than an hour without busting to go. I work in a job that it is hard to use the bathroom outside of prescribed break times. Even driving home after work ill pee before I leave and then often be busting by the time I get home (40 minutes).

  
2: Headaches - This has happened less often since I first started but yesterday I had a very bad headache for most of the day and then ended up finishing the fast a couple hours early just because I wanted to take something to relieve the headache but didn't want to do it on an empty stomach. Is this usually a sign that you are low on something?

  
3: Diarrhea - After a few days in a row of 23ish hours of fasting, when I break my fast for dinner i'll get diarrhea after. Like pure liquid. It's not so bad when you are at home but I went out for a nice dinner with my wife and having to duck out to the bathroom 3 times during the meal kinda put a dampener on it.

  
Any tips on these problems would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

But some of you are struggling to get ‘em.

If I wanted to set up a coffee date, as soon as tomorrow…

This is what I’d do:

**1. I’d look for people who are already spending money on ads.**

There are plenty of spy tools out there that will show you who's advertising in what niche but a lot of the time it’s way simpler than that.

Start searching for your ‘target’ niche on FB e.g solar UK, solar info, solar panels, solar grants, anything you can think of. The algorithm will kick in and start serving you ads from what could be ideal clients.

Also, do a google search. See who’s spending top dollar to be on the first few pages. It doesn’t matter if it’s an ‘organic’ hit or an ad, they’ll have had to invest one way or another to be so high up the rankings.

If you've already compiled a hit list of some businesses you wanna reach out to, remember to do a quick search on FB ad library first to see if they’re spending on ads.

**2. Do some recon on their ads and website**

Some basic recon on their ads will help you see what’s important to them (and their customers) right now, because they’ll be leading with their best hooks and angles.

Then I’d start jotting down what you see and what is good/bad/interesting.

Maybe you’ve noticed some interesting talking points in the comment section of their ads?

Then go to their website, to see if there’s anything cool/unique on their website that you can reference when you reach out to them.

**3. Be a Human. Not a Robot**

When it comes to striking up a conversation…

Remember, Mum’s love talking about their baby.

You’ve done some recon to find out what their baby is, so now use that as a lead in. e.g.

“Congrats on winning the Solar Provider of the Year award. It looks like you all had a great night collecting your award. Do you have the capacity to take on more jobs, or are you fully booked?”

Take your time. Personalize EVERY SINGLE outreach message.

People aren’t going to respond if you sound like a robot that’s regurgitating a templated message.

And if you’re looking to automate this process while maintaining a personal touch, [**discover how AI can help you run $100k+ campaigns effortlessly.**](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency)

**4. Do NOT go for the jugular** 

When it comes to outreach our ONLY goal should be to get the conversation started.

We should not try to sell.

We should not talk about commercials.

That feels too much like going straight for the jugular.

You can drop the offer once you’ve talked to them like a normal person and figured out if they are a good fit.

Remember this offer is so unbelievably attractive as we’re solving a bleeding neck problem for these business owners…

That they see us as the ‘prettiest girls at the prom’

We don’t have to beg to be chosen.

We get to do the choosing!

Getting on coffee dates is super easy, once you know how to approach them.

Follow my lead and these 4 simple rules…

I just recently started college. I was super nervous but excited about moving into the dorms and leaving home. My parents and brother came to help me move in and see me off. The dorm building looks amazing! It's one of the newer ones near the campus so it's a modern building and all the decor is fresh. It's really beautiful.

Moving in went fine, few tears but it was okay. I was super excited to start a new chapter in my life. The rooms are single rooms, each has an en suite shower and toilet in it too so no having to share facilities. The kitchen is shared as is a common room area with a TV and sofas. It's shared between 8 people and we found out it was 5 girls and 3 guys sharing those areas. I met everyone while moving in and everyone seemed friendly and just as nervous as me. There was one of the guys though who was very interested in me and another girl (both Asian) and began trying to impress us with the 5 words of Japanese he knows and all the anime/video game knowledge he has. I'm from the Bay Area and I'm not really all that knowledgeable about my heritage and what's going on in Japan. Even my family in Japan we don't really have any geeks for me to learn this stuff.

I brushed that off as it's not really the first time it happened, my family moved when I was in high school and I went to somewhere that didn't have many Asian students so some guys were interested in me based on my looks. So the other girl I'll call her Trish for this and we'll call the guy Chris the creep or just 'Chris' for short. I found out Trish has a boyfriend from high school and he comes to visit her and hangout since he goes to school not very far away. Chris also found this out as Trish told me he'd been talking to her in the common room and when her boyfriend visited he seemed to lose a lot of interest in her.

The other two guys I didn't talk to much but they seem nice. They told everyone in the dorm about a party on another floor that they were inviting people in the dorm to. I talked to some of the other girls and Trish and everyone gets along which is something I was worried about before coming to college and hearing roommate horror stories. But on to my horror story....Chris also came to that party and pretty much followed me around all night. We spoke a little but he mostly just seemed to be walking around anywhere I was and watching me. After I left he walked with me and another girl back to the dorm. She wasn't feeling well and I'd had enough so I said I'd walk back with her and he invited himself to help too. He pretty much ignored her and started asking me questions about boyfriends and if my parents will only let me date Asian boys. (what the fuck!?)

Anyway since the first week of moving in anytime I'm in the kitchen or common areas he's there. The only time I get a break is when he has classes but I don't think he goes to all of them and he's talking about changing one of them to one of my classes. I made some other friends and I've been eating with them a lot recently, he's even showing up in those areas we eat. You could argue it's coincidence because it's a popular spot for students to go but it feels like he's been spying on me.

My room has a lock at least so he can't come in here, not that he hasn't tried. One time I went to the kitchen to get some snacks I had in the fridge that I could heat up and eat while doing some work. He was in the kitchen doing his work and he starts talking to me. I wait for my food to cook and just kinda talk to him a bit. Then he vanishes from the kitchen by the time I turn around and I go back to my room. He's standing in there just looking around and complimenting my room. I got really angry and told him to leave and he just kinda laughs and leaves. One of the guys who also lives in the dorm saw it and asked if I'm okay. I just said it's fine and locked my door.

The most recent thing is I started finding poems slid under my door. It's obvious who it is and after I told Trish she and some other girls asked him and he denied it. After that happened I've had a new poem each day and they get progressively worse. He's also recently been telling people that he told his parents about me and his dad said we'd make a nice couple and they said he has pictures of me on his phone I don't know about. This person has no socialization skills and no concept of boundaries. Yesterday I had coffee with a guy from my classes as we were discussing some things we needed to read and where to get the books cheap. I guess Chris saw us as he was asking me who the guy was and I told him it's none of his business. This seemed to make him mad as he left the common room and went to his room. I was told later he came out and was pacing in the hallway near my room. I'm supposed to meet the same guy again soon as he invited me out and he was nice enough to help me so I said I'd buy him lunch today.

I feel uncomfortable that Chris will be watching me again and I don't feel comfortable when he's around me in the dorm. I wonder if he'll eventually get the message and go away or if this will continue and if he does keep following me around the dorm and asking me awkward questions, posting stuff under my door and so on what I should do about it.

He's technically not violated any rules by being where I am and it's also his kitchen and common area so I can't make him leave or tell him when he can be there. I don't think he should get away with this though.

tl;dr: Boy who has a thing for Asian girls in my dorm keeps hanging around in the kitchen and common room when me and another Asian girl are there. He started leaving her alone when he found out she has a boyfriend and focused on me. Is getting creepier posting poems under my door and denying it, asking questions about people I become friends with and randomly walking in my room when the door is unlocked. Not sure how to handle his creepyness since technically he has a right to hang out in the dorm when I'm there even if he bothers me by staring at me and only comes out his room when I'm around. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**0biterdicta**

>He's definitely into you. It doesn't matter that he hasn't broken any rules, he shouldn't be making you feel uncomfortable in your own dorm. You should explicitly turn him down (Chris, I am not interested in dating you) and speak to your RA/CA/whatever your college calls it. Part of their job is to manage relationships between students. A record of his behavior and of you reporting it will be useful if it continues or escalates

**OOP**

>>I think there are definitely some things here I'l need to do. I've been talking to some friends for support and I'm planning to reach out to the RA about the situation. I don't like the idea of him forcing me to move but I might request a dorm change if it comes to it. I'll also ask them if they can give me some advice on approaching him and making things clear that I'm not interested.

>>It's been hard to get that message across because he's not tried asking me out he just follows me around and posts stuff under my door. Maybe it's a problem they have dealt with before so they'll understand. I've also decided to start writing down when stuff happens so I can inform the RA of times and dates.

>>I should make some proper statement to him that nothing will happen between us and I'm not comfortable with what he's doing. He might just say I'm accusing him of stuff he's not doing though like with the poems. I really don't understand the guy. This isn't a way to get somebody to like you, it's done the opposite and make me dislike him a lot for being creepy and racist.


[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9fo569/im_18f_a_bit_creeped_out_by_a_guy_in_my_dorm18m/)  **Sept 13, 2018 (4 days later)**

There were a lot of people who offered me advice and encouragement to deal with my problem and I want to thank those people first. Since there was interest I thought I'd provide an update to the situation now a few things have happened.

So as I spoke about in the comments in my last post I'd sent an email to the RA in my dorm explaining the issue and asking to speak with her. She got back to me quite quickly and asked if I could come see her and also asked to speak to Trish the other Asian girl he'd made some comments to and hassled along with a couple of witnesses, the guy who heard me yell at Chris when he entered my room without permission and one of the people who witnessed photos of me on his phone.

She took some of their statements down and chatted with us all then with me alone for a bit. I spoke about things he's done like follow me and ask me questions about who I'm talking to and I bought some poems he slid under my door as evidence. We talked about what's been happening,how I'm feeling and about boys and college in general. She shared some of her own bad experiences with persistent guys and showed concern over things that have happened between me and Chris and felt like it needs to be stopped now before things can possibly escalate further. She especially was concerned at some quite racist things he's said and that he has pictures of me taken without permission. She said that it shouldn't ever be tolerated on campus and that she'll speak to her superior about our issues. I also talked about wanting to tell him how I don't want his attention and that he makes me uncomfortable and asked for mediation and she said she'll arrange it. She's a nice person to talk to, I'd not spoken with this RA much but seen her around.

The RD spoke with her and he decided he would bring us both in to his office to try and resolve some issues. I was nervous but the RA I spoke to before would also be there and I felt reassured at least that she's on my side. They asked me to speak first so I told him that I'm not interested in his advances and that his actions have made me feel intimidated and uncomfortable in my own home and around campus. He seemed all a bit naive and immature about the situation and acted like he couldn't understand what he was doing was wrong but he did acknowledge that entering other people's private rooms without permission was wrong and apologized.

When the subject of racism came up he said he didn't think what he said was racist. The RD explained that he can't say things like that and it's against school policy to discriminate against other races or make them uncomfortable with those kind of comments and Chris finally apologized for those comments too. When he spoke he agreed to not pursue me anymore and to stop posting notes. He was asked to remove photos from my phone and did it there in the room. He took several photos of me around the dorm and was told it was warned about respecting privacy and about student safety. He again seemed to miss the point and not really understand what he did wrong. Chris mostly just kept asking if his parents would be informed of any of this if he agreed to leave me alone. He seemed kinda angry but he couldn't really do anything with the RD in the room watching and all he could do was constantly ask that.

Anyway we concluded that he accepts I'm not interested in a relationship with him, he asked about being friends and I said I prefer we avoid each other as best we can and he eventually agreed to that too. He again apologized for making me uncomfortable and for making remarks that he shouldn't have made along with other stuff he did like pictures and being nosy. We pretty much agreed that we'll stay away from each other and that meeting ended. I didn't feel great but at least I said what I wanted to say. They also addressed what I told them about him saying he wants to do a class I'm in. They asked if he's applied to switch to that class yet and he said he hasn't. They said if he does they'll have a chat with them and make sure we are put in different classes. After the RA spoke to me again alone.

She gave me some leaflets she had and told me about a course I can take on campus to help girls with self confidence and dealing with bad situations at parties and stuff like that, and how to look after myself. Said if I'm worried about anything to call her on her number and we can talk. I felt a little better after that but still nervous about dealing with Chris who now felt wronged and probably like I told on him.

It turned out that after speaking with the RD alone he requested to move dorms. I was thinking of putting in a request but was told he'd already done so. I was not told of the reasons he gave but I'm assuming he decided he didn't want to risk getting into more trouble. I was told that the RD and him made some agreements and it's on record that he was warned about his behavior and he's agreed to various things to improve and to have regular counselling to improve his behavior.
He's agreed to not approach me or do anything that can be seen as harassment or intimidation. Things like watching me, spreading rumors or trying to contact me directly or through others and stuff like that.

He can't enter our floor of the dorm building after moving unless he's accompanied by an RA or campus security. (latter is just in case he leaves and says some of his belongings are in the dorm. He can come in with an RA and collect them and will have to leave right after. They'll be there to make sure he doesn't use it as an excuse to cause trouble.

He's not banned from the dorm building itself or visiting other people but if he's seen loitering around outside without any reason to be there they might consider it harassment or intimidation.

He also agreed to not ever do anything like follow any students around, post notes,enter private rooms or make racist comments and so on.

If he breaks any of these agreements he'll probably have some sort of discipline action taken and is being given a chance to behave himself. The RA said they'd prefer to not just punish students but work with them and hopefully he can have more positive relationships with other students.

I'm not 100% happy with him just being warned but at least he's agreed to leave the dorm and the new building he's in is about 15 minutes walk so no real reason why he'd need to come here since it's out the way. Spent one last night in the same dorm and we both stayed in our rooms and avoided speaking. The found a space for him pretty quick and helped him move the next day and that was it. He didn't come back to collect anything else and I've not seen him since he carried his stuff out the dorm yesterday. I hope he listens to the warning and sticks to what he said he'd stick to. I want to enjoy myself on campus again without worrying about what he might do. I didn't see him as dangerous but you never really know. I hope this will be the end of the issue and I can move on from this very stupid person.

tl;dr: Met with RA and RD at my dorm, gave evidence against the guy and they mediated a meeting between us so I could explain how his actions affected me and explain I'm not interested in him. He eventually apologized even if he didn't seem very genuine and also deleted photos of me. Later he requested to switch dorms and made an agreement with the RD to refrain from racist comments,leave me alone,not enter my dorm and not do anything to harass me or any other girls. Hoping that this will be the end of the situation as now he's been officially warned that any other actions will lead to more serious consequences.

Drinking black coffee before exercise can also boost fat burning.**

Black coffee is more than just a morning pick-me-up. It can play a significant role in your weight loss journey. The timing of your coffee consumption can impact its effectiveness. Drinking it in the morning kickstarts your metabolism and provides an energy boost.

Having it before a workout enhances fat burning and improves performance. Understanding the best times to drink black coffee can help you maximize its weight loss benefits. Let’s explore how you can use black coffee to support your weight loss goals effectively.

# Optimal Timing

Black coffee is a popular choice for weight loss. Drinking it at the right time can enhance its benefits. Understanding the optimal timing can help you make the most of your coffee routine.

# Morning Boost

Starting your day with black coffee can be beneficial. Drinking coffee in the morning can kickstart your metabolism. This helps burn more calories throughout the day.

Here are some reasons why a morning coffee boost is effective:

* **Increased Alertness:** The caffeine in coffee helps you feel more awake and alert. This can improve your focus and productivity.
* **Improved Metabolism:** Drinking coffee can boost your metabolic rate by up to 11%. This means you burn more calories even when resting.
* **Appetite Control:** Coffee can suppress your appetite, making you less likely to snack on unhealthy foods.

It’s best to drink your coffee at least 30 minutes before breakfast. This allows your body to absorb the caffeine without interference from food. If you experience stomach discomfort, try a small snack first.

|Time|Benefit|
|:-|:-|
|6:00 – 8:00 AM|Boosts metabolism and alertness|
|8:00 – 10:00 AM|Controls appetite and enhances focus|

# Afternoon Pick-me-up

Another good time to drink black coffee is in the afternoon. This can help combat the midday slump. Many people feel tired and less productive after lunch.

Here are the benefits of an afternoon coffee:

* **Improved Focus:** The caffeine can help you concentrate better during the second half of the day.
* **Increased Energy:** Coffee can give you a much-needed energy boost to finish your tasks.
* **Enhanced Mood:** Caffeine can improve your mood and reduce feelings of fatigue.

It’s ideal to have your afternoon coffee between 1:00 and 3:00 PM. Drinking coffee too late can interfere with your sleep. Aim to keep your caffeine intake moderate to avoid jitters or anxiety.

But some of you are struggling to get ‘em.

If I wanted to set up a coffee date, as soon as tomorrow…

This is what I’d do:

**1. I’d look for people who are already spending money on ads.**

There are plenty of spy tools out there that will show you who's advertising in what niche but a lot of the time it’s way simpler than that.

Start searching for your ‘target’ niche on FB e.g solar UK, solar info, solar panels, solar grants, anything you can think of. The algorithm will kick in and start serving you ads from what could be ideal clients.

Also, do a google search. See who’s spending top dollar to be on the first few pages. It doesn’t matter if it’s an ‘organic’ hit or an ad, they’ll have had to invest one way or another to be so high up the rankings.

If you've already compiled a hit list of some businesses you wanna reach out to, remember to do a quick search on FB ad library first to see if they’re spending on ads.

**2. Do some recon on their ads and website**

Some basic recon on their ads will help you see what’s important to them (and their customers) right now, because they’ll be leading with their best hooks and angles.

Then I’d start jotting down what you see and what is good/bad/interesting.

Maybe you’ve noticed some interesting talking points in the comment section of their ads?

Then go to their website, to see if there’s anything cool/unique on their website that you can reference when you reach out to them.

**3. Be a Human. Not a Robot**

When it comes to striking up a conversation…

Remember, Mum’s love talking about their baby.

You’ve done some recon to find out what their baby is, so now use that as a lead in. e.g.

“Congrats on winning the Solar Provider of the Year award. It looks like you all had a great night collecting your award. Do you have the capacity to take on more jobs, or are you fully booked?”

Take your time. Personalize EVERY SINGLE outreach message.

People aren’t going to respond if you sound like a robot that’s regurgitating a templated message.

**4. Do NOT go for the jugular** 

When it comes to outreach our ONLY goal should be to get the conversation started.

We should not try to sell.

We should not talk about commercials.

That feels too much like going straight for the jugular.

You can drop the offer once you’ve talked to them like a normal person and figured out if they are a good fit.

Remember this offer is so unbelievably attractive as we’re solving a bleeding neck problem for these business owners…

That they see us as the ‘prettiest girls at the prom’

We don’t have to beg to be chosen.

We get to do the choosing!

1ivb166,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1ivb166/struggling_to_get_over_someone/,Struggling to get over someone,"I (27f) met this guy (23m) about two years ago through our mutual hobby of social dancing. We built a general friendship through dancing with one another multiple times an event and chatting. After about a year of getting to know him I realized how much I liked him. I admitted the feelings to myself and started to convince myself that maybe he could feel the same way. We are very similar, he is easy to talk to and makes me laugh, we have great connection through dance, we feel very compatible in a-lot of ways. I have never met someone who makes me feel so grounded and at ease before. It’s like we have known each other our entire lives. We are so so similar. 

I finally worked up the courage three months ago to ask him on a date. He agreed and we got coffee and chatted for a few hours. It was amazing and I felt so hopeful for this new connection/development in our friendship. I seriously felt/feel a great connection with him. We brushed knees as we sat and flirted, it felt really good! At the end of the date I just said “I really like you and would like to do this again. But don’t feel any pressure because I don’t want to make our friendship weird” and he replied “oh yea definitely, I’m just really busy right now so I’ll get back to you” 

I saw him at another dance after (right before the holidays) and things seemed normal and a little deeper. But I gave him a hug after one of our dances (which is totally normal for us) but I did let my hand rest a little longer on his shoulders when we let go. But again we hug SO OFTEN after dances. But when I sat with him at the break things felt really weird, his body language was closed and just off (I think he was trying to send a quiet message that he wasn’t interested in me in that way). Long story short he never contacted me again for a date but we see eachother ALL the time. And he’s such a kind person that he hasn’t made me feel bad or awkward in our interactions. It’s like everything was before the date and my admission. 

My friends think he likes me still but I know the reality is that if he liked me, he would have asked me out again. I’m often the first person he asks to dance at events, I sometimes catch him looking at me at a distance, and we are back to normal with hugging and holding eye contact during dance. I have good days and bad days about it, but often I feel just horrific.

My sister says it was unkind of him to not give me an explanation or response. But I think it was his way to avoid hurting my feelings and our friendship. He knows I’m pretty sensitive and I think he truly does  care about me as a person. He’s a wonderful person. He just doesn’t like me romantically like I do. And he can’t help it. And I know it isn’t my fault and there’s nothing I can do. But I hate this feeling, I’ve never experienced it before. It’s worse than a break up, it’s like a break up with a possibility that will never happen. I’ll never know if we could have been a good match. 

And I’m thankful to still have his friendship. I’m so so thankful. But it’s also hard because when I see him all the feelings just come back up. Everytime we talk or touch during dance these feelings are dragged up again. The more time I spend with him the more these feelings linger. I can’t cut him out because we have so many mutual friends and it’s impossible to avoid him at social gatherings. I mean his sister takes a class I take. He didn’t do anything wrong anyways so it feels weird trying to avoid him at all costs. It’s not his fault he doesn’t like me romantically. And also I don’t want to cut him out, he is so lovely and kind and again I have never had this connection with someone before. And I know I need to shift this connection in my head to the platonic part of my brain. But it’s so hard. 

I just don’t know what to do. I know these feelings/this connection will never go away completely but I just wish I could move it all back from before I realized I liked him. When we were still just only friends. I just like him so much it makes me stomach in knots when I think that he doesn’t reciprocate. I’ll never know why and I don’t want to know why. I just want to move on. I just want these feelings to go away. I feel crazy. I think about him all the time. My hobbies include him or his sister!! So I can’t even use them to distract myself. He’s like a permanent fixture in my life right now. I wish this didn’t affect me. I have always been such an independent woman. This is just so hard.

Let’s talk about turning flat exchanges into something alive, using the same two dudes, Jeff and Mike, in the same boring parking lot encounter. We’ll start bad, get better, and maybe even stumble into *good*.  

---

**A “Good Try”**  
*Setup: Jeff spots Mike outside a gas station. They’re old friends.*  

Jeff: “Hey, Mike. Long time no see.”

Mike: “Yeah, man. How’ve you been?”

Jeff: “Good. Work’s busy. Sarah and the kids are great.”

Mike: “Cool. My job’s okay too. Linda left me, though.”

Jeff: “Oh. Sorry to hear that.”

Mike: “It’s whatever. Want to grab a coffee?”

Jeff: “Sure.”

This isn’t *awful*. It’s polite. It *moves*. But it’s a transcript, not a story. Every line dutifully passes the baton: *Your turn, my turn, your turn*. The problem? **No subtext, no friction, no voice.** Mike drops “Linda left me” like he’s mentioning the weather, and Jeff reacts like he’s reading a sympathy card. We learn facts (*Linda, kids, job*), but not who these people *are*. It’s the literary equivalent of two mannequins reciting grocery lists.  

---

**Better Version**  
*Same setup. Same guys. Different universe.*  

Jeff sees Mike leaning against a dented pickup, staring at a phone screen cracked like a spiderweb. Jeff hesitates—*shit, it’s been three years*—but walks over, hands jammed in pockets.  

Jeff: “Still driving that relic, huh?”

Mike doesn’t look up. “Still pretending you know shit about cars?”

A flicker of a grin. Jeff taps the truck’s hood. “Hey, this thing got me home from Jake’s wedding. Drunk as hell, swerving into that ditch—”

Mike: “—And I told you to call a Uber.” He finally glances at Jeff. “You look like hell.”

Jeff: “Kids’ll do that. Heard about Linda.”

Mike’s jaw tightens. He shoves his phone into his jeans. “Heard about what, exactly?”

Jeff: “Just… that she moved out.”

Mike snorts. “Yeah. ‘Moved out.’ With my boss. Real classy.”

Jeff lets out a low whistle. “Damn. That why you’re here at 7 a.m. buying…” He squints at Mike’s grocery bag. “...applesauce and whiskey?”

Mike: “Breakfast of champions. You in or what?”
 
Good dialogue isn’t about planning it out like a chess move. It’s about letting characters fail to say what they mean. Start by asking: **What’s the one thing they’d never admit out loud?** For Mike, it’s *I’m terrified I’m unlovable*. For Jeff, it’s *I’m scared you’ll spiral and I can’t fix it*. Then, let them talk about *anything else*—cars, coffee, the weather—while that fear bleeds through.  

Voice isn’t a quirk. It’s defense mechanisms. Mike uses sarcasm like armor; Jeff deflects with humor. Let their vocab reflect their damage. A guy who says “Breakfast of champions” while holding a bottle of whiskey isn’t “witty.” He’s screaming for help in a language he thinks you’ll ignore.  

Learn to *use the room*. The cracked phone? That’s Mike’s pride. The dented truck? Their friendship’s mileage. The applesauce isn’t symbolism—it’s a punchline that makes the audience think *Oh, this guy’s* ***fucked***.  

Stop trying to make characters “talk.” Let them hide. Let them snipe. Let them say “You in or what?” when what they mean is *Don’t let me do this alone*.

## Who Are These Earbuds For? Understanding ⁢the Target Audience

To truly understand which earbuds are right for you, it’s crucial to consider the specific needs and ⁢preferences of⁣ diffrent user groups. We’ll tailor the insights to the following segments:

*   ​**Tech-Savvy Consumers:** these individuals are knowledgeable⁢ about ​technology, actively research products, and value features like sound⁢ quality, **active noise⁢ cancelling earbuds**, and comfort.

## ‌Design and Comfort: A ⁤Matter of Preference

the aesthetics and comfort of earbuds are highly subjective, but some key differences exist between the **Beats Studio Buds Plus vs AirPods Pro 2**.

the⁣ AirPods Pro ‌2 retain ‍the iconic stem design, a‌ signature look that's instantly recognizable. They come with four sizes of silicone ear tips (XS, S, M, L) to ensure a secure and comfortable fit for a wider range of ear shapes. ‌The stems also house touch controls for playback,volume,and ‍call management.

The Beats Studio Buds plus, on the other hand, opt for a stemless design, which some users find more discreet and comfortable. They also include ​four sets of ear tips (XS,S,M,L) for a customized fit. The external surfaces offer physical button controls, providing tactile feedback.

For **comfort and fit**, both earbuds are designed for⁤ prolonged wear, but the stemless design of the Studio‍ Buds Plus might be preferable for those who dislike the feeling of stems protruding from their ears.⁤ Conversely, Apple ⁤Ecosystem Users might prefer AirPods pro 2 as they are​ **earbuds for⁣ iPhone**.

## Sound​ Quality: A ​Deep Dive

The most critical aspect ⁣of any earbuds is, of course, ⁤the sound quality. Let's break down the sonic performance of the **Beats Studio Buds Plus vs ‌AirPods Pro 2**.

**AirPods Pro⁤ 2:** Powered by the ⁢**H2 chip**, the AirPods Pro 2 deliver a rich, detailed, and balanced⁢ sound signature. The chip enables advanced computational audio algorithms that optimize​ the sound in real-time based on the ​shape of your ear canal and the ⁣content you're listening to⁤ using **adaptive EQ**. They provide excellent clarity across the frequency range, with a punchy bass response ⁣that doesn't ⁤overpower the mids and highs. The **apple airpods pro 2**⁤ are known for their precise imaging and wide soundstage, creating an immersive listening experience.

**Beats Studio Buds Plus:** Beats has traditionally been known for its bass-heavy sound profiles,but the Studio Buds Plus represent a more refined and balanced approach.While the bass is still present and impactful, it’s now better controlled and doesn't muddy the mids and highs. They produce a clear and detailed sound with a wide soundstage.The **beats studio buds plus vs airpods pro 2 sound quality**⁣ comparison ultimately depends on⁣ personal preference. Audio Enthusiasts who prefer a neutral and analytical sound signature might lean ⁣towards the AirPods‌ Pro‍ 2. Those who⁤ enjoy a slightly more bass-forward and energetic sound could prefer the ⁤Beats Studio Buds plus. Both are among ⁣the **best earbuds for music**‌ for different listening preferences.

## Active Noise cancellation (ANC) and Clarity Mode: Silencing the World

In a noisy world, effective ANC is a game-changer. Let's compare the noise cancellation‍ capabilities of these two contenders.

**AirPods Pro 2:** The ​AirPods pro 2 offer extraordinary ANC, effectively blocking out a wide range of ambient⁢ noises, from ⁢the rumble of a plane engine to the ​chatter in ⁣a busy coffee shop. the **H2 chip** enables advanced noise cancellation algorithms⁢ that adapt to your environment​ in real-time, further enhancing the noise-canceling performance. **Transparency ⁤mode** is equally remarkable, allowing you to hear your surroundings clearly while still enjoying your music.

**Beats Studio Buds Plus:** The Studio ‍Buds Plus⁣ have substantially improved ANC compared to their predecessor, providing a noticeable reduction in background‍ noise. While not quite as effective as the⁢ AirPods Pro 2 in extremely loud environments, the Studio Buds Plus still offer solid noise cancellation for everyday use.⁤ Their **transparency mode** also provides a clear⁢ and natural awareness of your surroundings.

The **noise cancellation comparison** reveals that the AirPods Pro 2 have a slight edge in‌ pure ANC performance. However,the Studio ​Buds Plus provide a very competent noise cancellation experience,especially for the price,giving value focused shoppers something to consider in this price comparison.

## Connectivity and Ecosystem Integration: apple vs. The World

Connectivity and ecosystem integration are crucial factors, especially ‌for users deeply embedded in specific ecosystems.

**AirPods ‌Pro⁢ 2:** The AirPods Pro‍ 2 shine when paired with Apple devices. The **apple H1 chip** enables seamless pairing, automatic device switching, and access to‍ features like **personalised spatial audio** and **find my**.⁤ They also support Audio Sharing, allowing you to⁣ share your audio with another pair of AirPods or Beats⁢ headphones. ‌While they can be ⁢used ⁤with ‌Android devices⁢ via Bluetooth, some features are limited.

**Beats Studio Buds Plus:** The Studio Buds Plus ​offer wider compatibility, ‌working seamlessly with both Apple and Android devices.‍ They​ support⁣ one-touch pairing on both platforms and offer access to features like ⁢Find My on iOS and Find My Device on Android. The Beats app provides additional customization options on both platforms.

Name: Max Cross
Age: 35
Occupation: Director of the FBI
Appearance: Tall (6’4”), lean but well-built. His once-dark hair has turned prematurely gray from years of stress and responsibility. His sharp grey eyes hold the weight of secrets most people will never know. His arms, back, and chest are covered in intricate tattoos—some personal, some earned, some mistakes he chooses to carry.

Background:
Max Cross was a prodigy, joining the FBI at 21 after earning dual degrees in criminology and cybersecurity. He climbed the ranks at an unprecedented pace, solving high-profile cases, dismantling international crime syndicates, and uncovering corruption within his own agency. His rapid rise made him both respected and resented. At 26, after the sudden resignation of his predecessor, he was appointed Director—the youngest in history.

Personality:
Ruthless when necessary, but fiercely loyal to those he trusts. He operates in shades of gray, knowing that the world isn’t black and white. His mind is always three steps ahead, calculating risks, making moves before anyone else sees the game. Despite his hardened exterior, those who truly know him understand that he carries a deep, unspoken burden.

Habits & Traits:
    •    Runs on black coffee and little sleep.
    •    Smokes when he’s alone, a habit he picked up during undercover work.
    •    Has a habit of rolling a coin between his fingers when thinking.
    •    Keeps a gun on him at all times, even in the safest of places.
    •    Despite his power, he often feels like he’s still fighting a war he can’t win.

Reputation:
To the public, he’s the face of law and order. To his enemies, he’s a ghost, an unstoppable force that always finds a way. Inside the Bureau, he’s a legend—but legends burn bright, and some don’t last long.

Max Cross didn’t have the kind of childhood that led to an easy life. Born into a broken home, he learned early that the world was cruel, and survival meant being smarter, faster, and tougher than the people who wanted to break you. His father was a violent man, his mother a ghost of the person she used to be. By the time he was ten, he had already seen enough to know that justice wasn’t something given—it was something you took.

Foster care, the streets, the system—he moved through them all, never staying in one place long enough to call it home. He fought, he ran, he learned. By the time he was a teenager, he had already built an iron will, a mind that never stopped calculating. But instead of letting the world break him, he turned his rage into something sharper, something unstoppable.

Now, as Director of the FBI, Max speaks with a calm, steady voice, never raising it, never showing his hand. His words are deliberate, measured, almost kind. But behind them, there is a quiet, unrelenting fury—a rage that never died, only learned to be patient. Those who know him best understand that it’s not a matter of if he’ll strike back, but when. And when he does, it’s absolute.",1,1740199012.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

Then we had kids and we just choked down the black stuff to keep the grind going. 

We don’t buy each other gifts, generally. So, this Christmas we decided to listen to our wealthy friends who all have these, and we got one for each other.

1ivam3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1ivam3w/everything_is_a_trigger_and_im_tired_of_it/,Everything is a trigger and I’m tired of it,"I’ve had this acid reflux for well over a year now. It started after a very bad green out on an edible and shortly after that I got acute gastritis, a cold/flu, my period, AND acid reflux all at the same time. (This happened in January 20th. The green out was the 5th)
Ever since then I have been struggling with food and drinks. I never smoke or drink alcohol, and I manage my anxiety and stress pretty well. I got put on Pantoprozol (20mg) and that caused me MAJOR mental distress so I had to quickly change to Rabeprozol (20mg) 1/day. While the medication helped my gastritis to go away, the burning in my throat persisted, and was HORRENDOUSLY BAD. I lived on buttered toast, raisin bran cereal, oat milk, water, and rice for 6-7months. I lost insane amounts of weight; went from 137 lbs to 108 lbs in the span of 1-3 months. It was awful.
No doctors back in Canada would help me; my own family doctor told me to “it sounds like acid reflux from stress. manage your stress the best way you can. Have a good one”, and completely ignored my complaints and symptoms. Never even bothered to look at my throat for the bare minimum. I got tested for H.Pylori via blood test and stool and it was negative, and was denied for a endoscopy/colonoscopy because I’m “young”. (Turning 30 this year)

Jump to recent months, I was able to eat and drink more things when I moved to Australia to be with my husband. I could drink coffee again, eat more food, have even mc Donald’s on occasion and everything it was wonderful. But the 100% guarantee triggers were anything with sucralose, spicy food, and sour candy. No problem, I’ll avoid those right? WRONG. 

Cut to present day and I’m now back to square one and worse. I no longer can drink water, milk, dairy free breakfast drinks,tea, anything without my throat lighting on fire. ESPECIALLY if I don’t have food to eat with it. If I eat and drink, it’s no problem.
Food? Everything is becoming a trigger. It’s now at the point where I give up on food and am starving myself because there’s just no point to life if I can’t enjoy snacks and meals or anything. I’m now trying to battle dehydration, critically low phosphate, and burning throat that’s so bad it feels like someone lit a match and shoved it down my throat. The only thing that gives me relief is when go to bed at night and sleep. I wake up the next day like nothing happened and it’s frustrating.
I don’t have permanent residency here in Australia so finding a doctor is going to be hard and costly and I’m at a complete loss… I’d rather die than keep having this burning throat haunting me. 

TL;DR: I have extremely bad burning throat from acid reflux with no other symptoms, everything is a trigger and I don’t know what to do anymore.",2,1740198807.0,acidreflux,5,0.75,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

""Help, I'm Bad at Math!"" Apps (aka Measurement & Calculations):

-Construction Master Pro Calculator (free version) - For when you need to figure out crazy angles and your brain's already done for the day. Perfect for stairs that actually meet code! (Revolutionary, I know)

-iHandy Level - Because somehow your phone is now better at finding level than that beat-up bubble level you've had since '95. Plus, it never needs recalibrating after falling off a ladder!

-Photo Measures - Take pics and scribble measurements right on them. No more cryptic notes like ""37 1/4... or was it 27 1/4?"" on random scraps of paper

-Smart Tools - It's like having Batman's utility belt, but for measuring stuff. Ruler, protractor, the works!

""Make It Pretty"" Planning Squad:

-Magicplan - Point your phone at a room and BOOM - instant floor plan. It's like magic, hence the name (I'm guessing their marketing team worked overtime on that one)

-Planner 5D (free tier) - Show clients their dream space in 3D before you build it. Way better than my usual ""imagine this, but nice"" approach

-Home Design 3D (free version) - Like Planner 5D's cousin who went to fancy design school. Great for when clients need to ""see it to believe it""

""Never Guess Again"" Reference Heroes:

-ColorSnap - For matching paint colors exactly, because ""eh, close enough"" doesn't fly with Mrs. Johnson's accent wall

-Lumber Calculator - Finally figure out board feet without looking like you're doing rocket science in the lumber aisle

-Electrical Calc Elite (free version) - Because guessing wire sizes is... let's just say not recommended 😅

""Get Your Life Together"" Job Management:

-Trello (free) - Like having a super-organized assistant who never calls in sick. Keep track of jobs without sticky notes everywhere

-CamScanner (free) - Turn receipts and invoices into PDFs before they become pocket-lint. Your accountant will actually smile at tax time!

-Google Keep - For those ""I'll remember that"" moments (narrator: ""He did not remember that"")

""Find That Thing You Need"" Parts Detective:

-Fastener Finder - When you're standing in the fastener aisle looking lost (we've all been there)

-McMaster-Carr app - It's like Google but for parts. Every. Single. Part. Ever.

-Home Depot/Lowe's apps - Check if they have what you need before making your third trip of the day. We both know you're going anyway, but still...

Listen y'all, I used to be that guy who'd roll his eyes at anyone pulling out a phone on the job site (unless it was for pizza orders, obviously). My trusty tape measure and I had a beautiful relationship - until it started lying to me about measurements. We're now seeing other people. 😂

Real talk though: These apps have saved my bacon more times than I can count. No more doing math in my head while a client watches me sweat, or pretending I totally meant to make three trips to Home Depot in one day. My phone's gone from being my pool billiards pro machine to actually helping put money in my pocket.

And let's be honest - nothing beats the look on a client's face when you whip out a professional 3D model of their project while the other guy is still drawing stick figures on a napkin. 

For my fellow ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" crew: I get it. But trust your grumpy uncle here - start with just one app. Play with it during your lunch break. Before you know it, you'll be the one posting ""mind-blown"" GIFs in the handyman subreddit.

Your phone can now do everything except hold your coffee and tell your client's dog to stop eating your tools. We're living in the future, might as well embrace it! 

Ok, now it's your turn. Which ones do you use, that I don't know about yet? They better be free!

P.S. Just in case you're wondering... Yes, I still use physical tools - haven't figured out how to hammer a nail with my phone yet.",1,1740198499.0,HandymanBusiness,0,1.0,False
1ivaigk,https://www.reddit.com/r/1500isplenty/comments/1ivaigk/advice_needed_on_calorie_deficit_meals/,Advice needed on calorie deficit meals,"Hi there! I wanted to get some feedback on my meal choices throughout the week. I am seeing progress but I feel like I could make more mindful choices + up my protein (want to aim for over 100g but its hard)

meal plan examples  below: 1500 cals per day

Breakfast-  either skip or zero carb wrap, egg white + low cal cheese, fruit bowl + coffee / protein smoothie

lunch- big salad or low cal turkey/tuna sandwich/BLT/ chicken wrap

dinner- low calorie pasta + salad or chicken meatballs, or salmon with rice / burger salad bowl / chicken and veggies / potatoes

dessert - kind frozen bar, trufru, yasso or fruit with chocolate

are my meals too carb based? it all fits into my calories at the end of the day but I feel like if I have a wrap for breakfast, sandwich for lunch and pasta for dinner it may not doing me any favors. I know with weight loss we can eat whatever we want as long as our portions are approbate and within our calorie range but I can't help but think I am doing something wrong and I shouldn't have a wrap for breakfast and a sandwich for lunch, and rice/potatoes for dinner? all in the same day.  I feel like I need more BALANCE? hope this makes sense.

TL;DR: lots of carb based meals, looking for balance 

open to feedback,  suggestions + advice!

We caught each others eye once, and she smiled back at me. She spent the year, by my locker trying to talk to me, lightly tapping me or poking me, saying my name. But I always ignored her. High school came, I continued to ignore her. She asked me about going to junior prom but I panicked and said no. She went with someone else because “he told me he had a crush on me, so I gave him a shot”.

I finally had coffee with her a couple weeks ago. She was still so beautiful. I bought her coffee, we chatted, and then she asked me “How do you remember us? What’s our connection to each other?” Which I thought was a weird thing to ask someone you haven’t seen in two decades. I told her stories, she said she didn’t remember a thing or two, and then I told her about prom and she told me about this other guy she went with and how he told her about his feelings. 

That was probably a hint for me to finally drop my feelings for her right there. But hey, I’m true to my brand, and my brand is being a scared MORON that fumbles his chance. 

She said she’d like to see me again before I left… but now she’s leaving me on read. 

I’m guessing I blew the universes one chance to at least tell her how special she is to me. How her freckles remind me of constellations in a night sky, or how her eyes are like two wells so deep you could see the moon reflecting in them, even during the day. She has the most radiant smile that lights up any darkness, and her voice is the sweetest and most precious sound in the world. God it hurts so much. The human heart is not meant to endure this much pain. 

I had a chance once, you guys. And I chose to do nothing with it. Don’t be like me. Take your shot. Tell them how you feel.

While they were coming straight from their econ majors and poli-sci honors programs, I had something more valuable: real-world experience.

I wasn’t like these kids who had spent their whole lives in textbooks. No, I had felt the cold injustice of the system firsthand when I was arrested at a Phish concert for smoking a joint in 2011. The charges were eventually dropped when my home state legalized cannabis (a decision I like to think I played some small part in influencing), but that experience stayed with me. I knew then that I had a calling to fight the system from the inside.

But first, I had to finish my degree.

I had taken a few… let’s call them intentional breaks from undergrad. College wasn’t really my focus back then. I was broadening my mind, exploring alternative modes of living, and following Phish on tour through the Southwest. Eventually, I returned to finish my degree in what I describe as a multi-disciplinary approach to law, ethics, and society (some call it ‘Liberal Studies,’ but I find that term limiting).

Law school, of course, was a rude awakening. Professor Kingsfield, a man whose only courtroom experience was watching ""Law & Order"" reruns, cold-called me on Pennoyer v. Neff during my very first class. I stammered, trying to recall the facts, but all I could think about was the legendary 38-minute Tweezer from the Nassau ‘98 show. Kingsfield sighed. ""Mr. Worthington III, Esq., are you familiar with the concept of personal jurisdiction?"" ""Uh, yeah,"" I mumbled. ""It's like when you're on lot before a Phish show and the guy selling veggie burritos insists he's 'sovereign,' but really he's subject to local vending laws."" The class erupted in nervous laughter. Kingsfield just shook his head. ""Clearly,"" he said, ""you need to recalibrate your mind.""

Law school continued in this vein. The professors were frauds, mere academics who had never even seen the inside of a courtroom. The students were even worse. One kid told me he was ‘interested in securities law.’ Securities law. I told him that was just capitalism’s way of keeping people docile and he should focus on the real legal battles. He nodded, then walked away and never spoke to me again.

Despite the systemic roadblocks put in place, rigid attendance policies, an insistence on ‘citing sources,’ mandatory team-building exercises that involved trust falls, I thrived. I graduated near the top of my class, thanks to my ability to think outside the casebook and a near-mastery of cold-calling tactics that left my professors speechless (some called it ‘interrupting,’ I call it passionate debate).

I had originally planned to go into criminal defense, give back to the people who really needed legal protection. But then I saw an offer from Kensington & Parr LLP, a firm specializing in corporate litigation, and I thought, who better to dismantle the system than someone working within it? So, yes, I now work in regulatory compliance for a pharmaceutical company, where my primary role is ensuring our sugar pills meet the minimum threshold of legality while being marketed as holistic cancer cures. The six-figure salary and firm-branded Patagonia vest are merely tools to finance my eventual rebellion.

I still keep a Phish bumper sticker on my company-leased SUV. Not out of nostalgia, but as a reminder of where I came from. Sometimes, when I sit in my corner office reviewing contracts that help multinational corporations circumvent environmental regulations, I take a deep breath and think, I’ve really made a difference. (Mostly by maxing out my 401k and finally being able to afford those limited-edition vinyl pressings.)

And if any of my young colleagues ever want to learn a thing or two about real lawyering, I’m always available for a mentor coffee. Just don’t ask me what my undergraduate degree was in. Or how many hours I billed last quarter. (It was a lot.)",0,1740198170.0,LawSchool,1,0.33,False
1ivaf4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1ivaf4d/four_options_confused_on_which_path_to_take/,Four options. Confused on which path to take.,"I am in need of some advice.  I know this is a long post.  At the very least, I hope you find it entertaining.  Here is my story...


The Ex:

About a year ago, I got out of a five year long relationship with the person I thought I was going to marry.  I loved her very much, but she got a new job in sales working 50 hours per week and when she would come home, she would just eat and go to sleep.  On weekends, she would spend time getting ahead of her workload for the week and didn't have time for cuddling, fun activities, or any kind of quality time.  She was not spending time with friends either, but just working and sleeping.  

For the last year of our relationship, the sex became very infrequent.  We'd do it once month at most.  When we did have sex, the passion had gone and it seemed like it was a chore for her.  I talked to her about it and she said I was great in bed, but she was too tired to be into it from working all the time.  I had multiple discussions about my unhappiness since she started the new job, as my needs in the relationship were no longer being met.  Though I suggested many solutions, she refused to make any compromise and we decided to part ways.  I was heartbroken.  I loved this woman, but we slowly drifted apart.  How could I be in a relationship with someone I barely spent time with?


The Colleague:

Now, one year after the breakup, my friends suggested I start dating again.  I work in public relations for a really good company.  At my job, there was this woman who always thought I was great and wanted to go out with me, but I didn't do it because I wasn't over my ex yet and I thought it would be strange to date a colleague.  She was persistent.

Finally, I agreed.  We went on three super amazing dates.  Our understanding of each other bordered on telepathy.  We had a crazy strong connection and she was gorgeous.  She then sent me over 100 rapid fire texts throughout the week, some of which were very flirtatious and sexual.  I didn't mind, as I really liked her, but I thought it maybe was a red flag.  I'd reply as often as I could, but out of nowhere, the messages stopped.  When I tried contacting her, I received no reply.  It was all very sudden.  She went from full-on obsession to ghost mode.  A week later, she told me she doesn't feel comfortable being in a relationship and would rather be friends.  I was confused, but respected her wishes and agreed to just be friends.  Unfortunately, I still think she is awesome, but I suspect she has a disorganized attachment style, which is very difficult to handle.  If not for that, I'd still be trying for a real relationship with her.  For a minute, it felt almost too perfect.  Very twin-flame.  She still flirts with me occasionally at work, but we always go our separate ways.


The Brain:

A few weeks after, I began dating a lovely woman I met in a coffee shop.  She works for another company in IT.  She is fun, nerdy, and intelligent.  We share stories of world history, science, and comic books (I'm into these things as well).  We've been together for four months now, seeing each other about three times per week.  

We had an awesome Valentine's Day.  I took her to the symphony and we went for a romantic dinner at an aquarium in an underwater tunnel.  The tropical fish swam around us while we dined and had great conversations.  There is one problem.  She just recently told me she is very religious and doesn't want to have sex until marriage.  Keep in mind that I'm 38yrs old and she is 33yrs.  At this point in my life, I want a healthy sex life.  We talked about it, but I don't think she will change her mind.  I have to respect that.  We are still dating, but here is where things get really interesting...


The Wild Card:

Out of nowhere, my original ex that works 50 hours a week calls me and tells me she wants me back!  She says she still loves me and misses me.  I told her I'm dating someone else and I don't cheat, so that won't be happening while I'm in another relationship.  Furthermore, she got promoted and now works even more.  I don't see it working out when she still won't have time to spend with me.  It still hurts my heart because part of me still loves her.


TL;DR:  I need some advice.  Here are my options as far as I can see it:

Option 1:  Stay with The Brain and enjoy her time and personality, but have no sex life.  She is otherwise fantastic, but I'll probably get sexually frustrated.

Option 2:  Go back to The Ex and have an intermittent sex life, but hardly get to spend time with her.  I'll probably still have a tough time with her workaholic lifestyle.

Option 3:  Pursue a relationship with The Colleague, probably have a great sex life, enjoy the twin-flame, but risk that it could go really bad since she has a disorganized attachment style and I have to work with her.

Option 4:  Return to the dating pool and keep searching for love.

Please help me decide!

1ivad7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1ivad7t/ace_attorney_3_trials_and_tribulations/,Ace Attorney 3 (Trials and Tribulations) – Spoiler-free review,"I played the first 2 games a long while back and I remembered enjoying it. Ace Attorney 3 largely follows the same formula as the previous games. Read my full review [here](https://tokkidokkie.wordpress.com/2025/02/21/ace-attorney-3-trials-and-tribulations-visual-novel/).

Characters:  
Most of the main cast of characters from the first two games are carried over, with Phoenix, Maya and Pearl etc. The notable new character in this game would be Godot, being the new prosecutor. He’s an okay character, being the type to give sarcastic jokes and quips. The running gag with him is that he absolutely loves drinking coffee, it can feel overplayed at times, but I personally didn’t mind it. The dynamics between Phoenix, Maya and Pearl is always nice to see and quite cute. The judge and Gumshoe are basically the whipping boys and for comedic relief, similar to the first two games. Overall, not much complaints.

Plot:  
I’ll go over this episode by episode.

Episode 1-Not very tense or high stakes, but does provide some interesting backstory to Phoenix and Mia’s past. It’s an okay case in that we got to see another side of Phoenix and also get to know some backstory.

Episode 2-Probably the worst in this game, and in general not a very good episode. The plot twists were all meh, the stakes and tension wasn’t high and I think the killer is the characters weren’t funny, and their jokes didn’t land for me. Slightly bad and boring.

Episode 3-Followed largely the same formula, stakes and tension still wasn’t high enough, but the case felt better overall because the characters and witnesses in this case were funny. I enjoyed this one.

Episode 4-Quite an interesting case as we got to see Mia and Edgeworth first case as attorney and prosecutor respectively. Characters in this case weren’t funny, but they weren’t trying to be. The context behind this case is quite interesting, and it also serves to build up for the final case. It’s okay.

Episode 5-The absolute high point of the game. It has everything, good plot twists, high stakes and tension, funny characters and a great ending to boot. This case also ties up a lot of loose ends relating to this Ace Attorney trilogy, so in my opinion, I thought it was the perfect ending to the trilogy. I would compare this with Danganronpa cases, I’m of the view that Danganronpa cases are just better than Ace Attorney, but this case can definitely rival the Danganronpa ones.

Worldbuilding:  
Almost non-existent, very character-focused game. If I had to say something, it is that they expanded on Mia Fey and the Fey clan.

Art:  
It’s decent and charming, but nothing to write home about when compared to others. Not your typical anime art style, but still visually pleasing. The sprites are cute and one good thing is that they have a lot of expressions. Soundtrack is nothing special, just background music.

Gameplay:  
Point-and-click style, like Danganronpa or Paranormasight. Personally not a big fan of the investigating portion, it feels like you have to click everything. I like the trial portion more, even though you have to press on every statement too, but I thought it fitted the game very well.

I occasionally used a guide when I’m lost on what evidence to present, but they all make sense and most of the time if you think carefully, you will arrive at the answer. They give clues sometimes too. If you are a megamind, you probably don’t need a guide.

Also minor gripe, but I thought it was too easy to lose health, and made me over-reliant on saving. It would be nice if you could regenerate some health during recess.

Game does not have a backlog, I’ve checked and I think all the original trilogy games on all consoles don’t have a backlog, which is pretty jarring for a text-heavy game (since VNDB doesn’t consider it a VN lol).

Conclusion:  
Would rate it a high 7/10. 7+. 2nd episode was kinda bad, but the rest were okay, with the final case being spectacular. Great ending. The characters and their humour for the most part lands for me. I find humour to be a very important aspect in the Ace Attorney series. I would say Danganronpa is better, but you definitely wouldn’t regret playing this.

1ivad0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginedragons/comments/1ivad0s/reflections_is_not_all_sm_demos_proof/,Reflections is NOT all S+M demos + Proof,"Hello! Macy here, you know me as the cool person that made the discog doc and made the art for The Itch. There has been a lot of discourse about what songs are from what eras. Many people believe the band's promotion that the songs are all from the Smoke + Mirrors, while others believe that the songs are from eras all over the place. I hope this post puts all those theories and arguments to rest.

  
Earlier today, the band did an IG live, where they discussed the recent release, stating that ""Reflections is out, which is a collection of songs that were made during the Smoke and Mirrors era, and worked on throughout the years. Some of them earlier, some of them we worked on post-Smoke and Mirrors."" - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkAiG\_Js-bo&t=47s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkAiG_Js-bo&t=47s)

This brings us to the rest of the songs. Using our knowledge of the confirmed S+M songs, we can hear that not many songs sound like that. Truthfully, I Get Carried Away is the only one that sounds like that era, featuring the heavy EDM/Dubstep sound found within The Ghost Intervention. 

Songs like Woke, A-OK, Playin' Me, My Car, Monica, and Cowboy all have a similar quality when it comes to lyrics, vocals, and instrumentals. The lyrics SCREAM Mercury, with the simplistic and upfront meanings, compared to the often poetic lyrics from the S+M days. Along with this, the vocal quality is completely different to the confirmed demos like Easy, Black, and Destroyed. 

One last point, we can infer that the songs seen within The Itch compilation were meant to be considered for Reflections. These songs are all from incredibly different eras, with songs like Coffee (Mercury sounding) and Stars (2009-10). This just goes to show that not every song is from S+M era.

All of this to say, No, Reflections is not *only* S+M.",19,1740197943.0,imaginedragons,2,1.0,False

As an introverted person I wish I could go out by myself in the evenings without being closed off or bored. I can do a coffee shop, book store, thrift store, museums by myself in the daytime. But going to sit down at a bar or something other night time activity? No, i feel like an imposter, like what am i doing there?

My BF on the other hand, likes to go out by himself. He talks to everyone including the bartenders and can have a conference on all sorts of subjects. He goes to bars just to watch basketball games or whatever sports are on TV. 

Tonight (it’s rough 11pm) he called me while he is sitting at a bar & I expressed how i wish i can  go out and he said “well no one is stopping you, go out”
I replied “i have no friends to go out with” — my friends constantly bail or are never available 
he says “go out with yourself, i don’t wait on friends to go out, i’m bored”
Me: well i am a woman, so it’s a little different

We’re 40 min away from each other so it’s not like going out is convenient unless we make the arrangements. 

In my early 20s i went out to EDM events alone but I was always photographing so it was easy. The camera was my “anxiety relief” in social settings. After covid I became completely more introverted, more anxious about going out without someone, the camera is no longer an anxiety relief— i feel silly with my camera sometimes. 

I would like to go out and make new friends in organic environments. I have no kids, I graduated college, I have far too much free time on my hands now. ",1,1740197887.0,self,1,1.0,False

Sounds silly given the concept. I have a young boy and we both really like the game, but we like variants in general and he wants to construct a versus scenario. I'm all for a creative challenge, though. How could this work if both pilots must work together?

He brought up the concept of being 'better' or 'more helpful' so maybe a system of demerits for things like no enhancements or needing to use coffee. If I am copilot I get a minus point every time I miss activating flaps. Stuff like that. Almost like you are getting graded in a flight simulator.

My own brainstorm was to construct some kind of trainer role for one pilot. Their job is to make landing a bit more challenging but without utterly sabotaging the game. For example, they would always be first to place for axis and engines and the other needs to adjust. They would announce what they are willing and not willing to do per round, be a contrarian taskmaster. That requires some articulated and maybe even written forethought.

I'd love to see your brainstorms. We love the game as is and we don't really need to 'appreciate it for what it is.' If we can't come up with a variant, no big whoop.",1,1740197837.0,boardgames,3,0.67,False

Incredibly cool setting, interesting combat mechanics (having to time your crits), refreshing encounter system (where you can physically evade enemies), nice variety of items and features... there's even a bank with actual intrest rates! I loved how each of my characters occupied a different niche and had a different playthrough experience - even though I missed most of the guns since I couldn't equip rifles, shotguns or big guns (might have to do another playthrough down the line!).

Oh, can't also forget the catchy tunes and the amazingly detailed sprites! 

As someone who grew up on older Final Fantasy titles, Grimstone was a trip down memory lane. The feeling of figuring out all the systems with minimal handholding was refreshing. Difficulty was punishing just the right amount - you had to really understand the game systems. I actually beat the final boss without even getting hit with Anne and Umbra lol. It's one of those games that reward knowledgeable players. 

Is it grindy? Yeah, absolutely. But to me it was a cozy grinding experience. I knew I was progressing a little every time I played. Some days I'd log in just to grind some Coffee and get up a level for the following area. Early game was especially punishing with my party setup and not having access to many skills.

No matter your opinion on Grindstone, I think we can all agree how incredible it's only ONE game out of 50 in the UFO collection.
