I am a 24 yr old fresh IT graduate. I’ve been part-time working sa isang coffee shop for 2 yrs since I was in 3rd yr college to support myself due to family and financial problems.

Everyday I get nagged by my mom to apply other jobs that are tech related so I can use my degree. But my crippling anxiety is making it even harder for me to apply new jobs, thinking I need to be perfect for the role first before engaging to war(working industry). When in the end, I don’t accomplish anything at all.

Even though I graduated with Latin honors, I don’t feel confident with my tech skills anymore because of my current field of work which requires more of physical labor and skills. I couldn’t enhance my tech skills anymore, even if I want to, I’d rather rest due to physical exhaustion. I also have an auto-immune disease that’s why I can’t see myself working in longer term in the coffee shop due to physical breakdown. And I’ve been clinically diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety since high school.

I can’t explain how scared or anxious I am in this moment of life… in every moment of my life actually, where every choice will affect my future, but of course I’m also aware of that ever since. But right now, I feel like there’s a heavier burden (LIKE WDYM MY FUTURE IS MY HANDS?!)

Just recently I tried applying multiple times, but all of them got rejected. I am trying to muster up my fears, but why do I feel like I’ll just keep sinking below?

Idk why I felt like posting here maybe looking for advice, since the adults I know are just forcing me, but not listening to me. Thank you for reading.",1,1746742136.0,MentalHealthPH,1,1.0,False

*A Short Sequel to Stephen King’s* *The Long Walk*

It was two years before Ray Garraty stopped waking up in the middle of the night with the sound of footsteps in his ears.

Not his own. Not anymore.

These belonged to the others. Boys who had walked beside him. Who had laughed and cried and moaned and bled and dropped. Boys with names and boys without. Names he knew. Names he tried to forget.

Barkovitch. Collie Parker. Abraham. Olson. McVries. Scramm.

Sometimes he heard the rifles too, but not always.

By the time he turned nineteen, Ray and Jan were living together in a small cedar-sided house about fifteen minutes outside of town. It had a porch that caught the evening light and a crooked wooden mailbox that refused to stand straight, no matter how many times his stepfather came by to fix it.

His mom visited once a week. Sometimes she brought pies. Sometimes she brought silence. But she *came*. That mattered.

They didn’t talk about the Walk. But they all knew it was there. Like a shadow hanging behind the coat rack in the hall. Ray had learned not to flinch every time it moved.

Jan never pushed. She was different now too—quieter, older in the eyes. But when Ray looked at her, when she reached out and touched the inside of his wrist the way she always had, he remembered what it felt like to walk toward something instead of away.

Ray hadn’t kept the full Prize.

Most of it—nearly all of it—he’d redirected. He used the Major’s own signature against him in the paperwork, tying the bureaucracy in knots until they had no choice but to honor his request. Scramm’s widow received a house and a fully-funded trust for the baby Scramm never got to meet. Medical debt wiped clean. A future, however small.

Ray never met her. He just sent the letter, and the money, and told himself it was enough.

But Jan had made him keep *something*. Not out of greed. Just decency.

“You walked for it,” she’d said. “So walk *into* something with it.”

So they bought their house outright, modest and bright. Paid off his mother’s mortgage. Put a down payment on a reliable car. The kind that started even when the frost hit hard in October.

They didn’t live rich. But they lived *real*.

That spring, Ray received a letter.

>

Ray stared at the letter for a long time. Then he folded it carefully and placed it beside a small box of dog tags—McVries’—found in the mud, long after the Walk was over.

That night, he didn’t sleep.

He got up early the next morning and walked to the edge of their property. Jan followed him barefoot, coffee in one hand, a quiet question in her eyes.

“You okay?” she asked.

“I don’t know,” he said. Then: “I think I need to write back.”

He did.

>

That year, something happened.

At mile forty-two, Hugh Lancer slowed.

Not much. Just a breath. A moment of hesitation.

And then—without a word—he stopped.

Not out of protest. Not defiance.

Just… stopped.

And then the boy behind him did the same. And the next. And the next.

Eight of them left.

All eight sat down together in the middle of the road.

The crowd surged forward, shouting, shrieking. Some cheering, some confused. The Major appeared in his dress uniform, storming down the asphalt like a tank ready to fire.

The guns didn’t come.

For the first time in the history of the Long Walk, they stayed silent.

Security fumbled. Officials whispered. Cameras cut away.

And by sunset, the announcement came:

>

But behind the official language, something had broken.

Something that wasn’t meant to bend.

Ray didn’t watch it on TV. He was in the garden with Jan, pulling weeds and humming a tune he couldn’t quite place.

That night, they had dinner with his mom and stepfather. Over roast chicken and mashed potatoes, no one mentioned the news. But his mother looked at him a little longer than usual. His stepfather slapped his back and asked about the Red Sox. And Jan held his hand under the table.

Later, when the dishes were done and the house had gone still, Ray stepped onto the porch and looked at the stars.

Clear and distant. Peaceful.

For the first time since he’d taken his last step in the Walk, Ray Garraty felt something close to rest.

Not perfect. Not painless.

But peace, all the same.",1,1746741833.0,stephenking,0,1.0,False

We live in Denmark, where a latte costs about $7, so with around 20 per month, that adds up to roughly $140 just on coffee.

I have a Nespresso OL machine, which makes okay coffee, but it doesn’t compare to a real espresso. He’s looking for something that can make lattes similar to what you’d get at a café. We understand that flavor depends on factors like the beans and milk, but equipment matters too.

Now, he’s thinking about buying an espresso machine that can replicate that café-quality taste as closely as possible—within a student budget. We know we won’t get the same results as a high-end café machine, but we’re hoping to find something affordable that still produces great coffee.

We’re not sure about the budget yet, since we don’t really know the price range or features of espresso machines. We’ve watched plenty of videos, so we’re confident we can learn to use it.

I admire the graceful social contract of coffee shops, where everyone politely pretends they don't notice me aggressively whispering ""REPRESENTATIVE"" to an automated phone menu as if I'm trying to summon a customer service spirit without disturbing the ambiance.  
  
I find it absolutely delightful that I can recite my coffee order with scientific precision—""half-sweet, triple-shot, extra-hot, oat milk cappuccino with exactly 4.2 grams of cinnamon and a clockwise stir""—yet when the barista asks for my debit PIN, my brain suddenly operates at the computational power of a concussed goldfish.

Now, it all seems like a chore. I loved the smell of fresh baked bread and knowing it had no preservatives or HFCS, having muffins with coffee, bringing scones to friends. And I just…don’t care. 

It ain’t the first time and I know it’s just par for the course…maybe I’ll pick it back up casually and happy to have the knowledge but…Really thought this one would stick - it’s food after all - and brought me and others so much joy!

so the whole massage thing ended up happening for about 5 hours straight and that entire time we were talking and we ended up falling asleep in the same little spoon big spoon with his hand over me and after that we got closer. at other sleepovers we were once again really close and there was clearly some tension but the others erre awake so nothing happened. we then all went out one morning and played football and the entire time he was either tryharding or fucking with me and at the end we were just laying on the grass and just talking and we were still teasing eachother.

after that we went out during the morning just the 2 of us and we had a really nice time we went to go get coffee, eat and then we went to a shop that has everything from toys to house supplies to clothes and we ended up being there for awhile and the entire time we were running around hitting eachother throwing stuff at rachother and at his house the same thing we were pillow fighting, putting music on and dancing and singing and we had a deep conversation at some point aswell.

we have went out 2 more times alone during the morning and he has still not made a single move and we have been really close for the past 2 months. idk what to do bc this whole thing i’m guessing clearly isn’t just a fried thing to him but the problem is i dont know the reason why he hasn’t made a move and i’m not sure wether he isn’t making a kove because he really likes me and wants to go slow or because he wants to know me better or if he is just fucking with me bc he is bored.

i’ve also seen his texts in the only girl he’s talking with and even tho i can make a move i don’t want to because i want to see the move from HIM so i know what’s really going on. also today we went out and even tho we usually always talk from messages after he hasn’t texted me but he has sent me tiktoks and responded to those i’ve sent to him.

what can i do? why has it been 2 months and he hasn’t made a single move? all the things that are happening are showing that he is into me but isn’t 2 months abit too much? i need ur opinions please

we have been talking all day and whenever we’re out because we usually hang out at homes we’re really touchy and very close and at sleepovers we always sleep at the same place we always tease eachother he is always looking at me and a few days ago my mom met all of them and she was telling me how she’s 99% sure V likes me because he was looking at me all the time. V has also said he likes punching me for no reason it’s just fun (he doesn’t actually hurt me it’s the playful fighting) and pretty much it’s pretty obvious there’s something there, and he even KNOWS i like him because one of our other friends that isn’t in the group anymore, has told him. so he knows, i know and all the group knows. 

at sleepovers we’re always the last awake and although we’re talking and everything he hasn’t made a move and although i really want to i’m scared. at a specific sleepover we were talking and out of nowhere the subject of massages comes up so he tells me if i can do him a massage. so i start doing him a back massage nothing really special he was just laying down on the couch and i was sitting and then he did it to me and as time went on we got abit more close. so after awhile we were just being little spoon big spoon and playing with eachothers hair and doing that nail scratch thing on the arms yk. and after awhile he says if i can do him a massage under his shirt so i say ok and i start doing it and after i tell him to do the same and he asks under or over ur shirt? and i say idk whatever u want and he says no u choose so i say under and to make it abit more comfortable i unzipped my bra and afterwards he helped me zip it back up without me asking him to. 

so the whole massage thing ended up happening for about 5 hours straight and that entire time we were talking and we ended up falling asleep in the same little spoon big spoon with his hand over me and after that we got closer. at other sleepovers we were once again really close and there was clearly some tension but the others erre awake so nothing happened. we then all went out one morning and played football and the entire time he was either tryharding or fucking with me and at the end we were just laying on the grass and just talking and we were still teasing eachother. 

after that we went out during the morning just the 2 of us and we had a really nice time we went to go get coffee, eat and then we went to a shop that has everything from toys to house supplies to clothes and we ended up being there for awhile and the entire time we were running around hitting eachother throwing stuff at rachother and at his house the same thing we were pillow fighting, putting music on and dancing and singing and we had a deep conversation at some point aswell. 

we have went out 2 more times alone during the morning and he has still not made a single move and we have been really close for the past 2 months. idk what to do bc this whole thing i’m guessing clearly isn’t just a fried thing to him but the problem is i dont know the reason why he hasn’t made a move and i’m not sure wether he isn’t making a kove because he really likes me and wants to go slow or because he wants to know me better or if he is just fucking with me bc he is bored. 

i’ve also seen his texts in the only girl he’s talking with and even tho i can make a move i don’t want to because i want to see the move from HIM so i know what’s really going on. also today we went out and even tho we usually always talk from messages after he hasn’t texted me but he has sent me tiktoks and responded to those i’ve sent to him.

what can i do? why has it been 2 months and he hasn’t made a single move? all the things that are happening are showing that he is into me but isn’t 2 months abit too much? i need ur opinions please",1,1746740608.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

1ki23zh,https://i.redd.it/20s410j4omze1.png,I started mailing ridiculous poems to strangers. Now I'm doing a live show. Keep going.,"In January, I launched a small, quiet art project where I mail handwritten poems to strangers for just the cost of the paper and the stamps.  
  
I’m a marketer by trade, but I wanted to focus on the passion, not the profit - so I ditched all my business instincts, kept it as bare-bones as possible, and grew it mostly from word-of-mouth or flyers at the local coffee shop.   
  
No target personas or customer journeys. No nurture campaigns or viral short-form videos. No real strategies for profit. Just sending ridiculous poems about emails, corporate culture, and the absurdity of normal life to a bunch of brave mailboxes.  
  
Honestly, I didn’t think it would go anywhere. It was pretty slow. Pretty quiet. But I was content with that. I just wanted to write poetry.  
  
Then, recently, a pianist at a local university reached out. They had signed up for my project and felt inspired by it, asking if they could help bring it to the stage - to turn my poems into a musical performance for the community, with funding and backing already prepared. There are plans to perform in several other cities around the state, too.  
  
Listen, it's not like I just sold a start-up for millions of dollars or an app to Apple. And I know a profitless poetry project is very different than a lot of the amazing stuff you guys are making here. But I think it still says something about pursuing a passion.  
  
If you’re building something weird, slow, or quiet: keep going.  
  
Focus on making something you're excited about. You truly never know who it might reach - or what it might grow into.

They are not sentient.
They are not alive.
They are fucking corporate NPCs made out of decaf coffee, LinkedIn buzzwords, and the crusty remnants of expired dignity.
They are the human equivalent of autoplay ads. They exist only to waste your time, drain your soul, and look surprised when you don’t want to write a fucking cover letter for a job that pays less than a Taco Bell night shift.

They sit behind their desks—scraping job boards, drooling on keywords, ghosting candidates like emotionally stunted exes with WiFi—and dare to call it a profession. A “career.” Bitch, you’re not a talent scout. You’re a corporate cockroach with a WiFi connection and the same six behavioral questions copy-pasted into a Word doc since 2003.

“Tell us about a time you had to deal with a difficult coworker.”
Yeah, how about right fucking now? I’m dealing with YOU, you glorified Outlook calendar in a blazer. That count?

You click “Apply.” You upload your resume. You retype the resume into 27 boxes because their shit-bucket-ass portal was designed by a blind raccoon with a head injury. You attach a cover letter that makes you want to staple your eyelids shut. And what do you get?

FUCKING. NOTHING.

Not a reply. Not a confirmation. Not a “Hey we’re going with someone else.”
Just pure, malicious silence—like they’ve entered the Shadow Realm with your dreams, your time, and your willingness to ever apply for another fucking job.

And the interviews? If you make it to that stage? Jesus fuck.

Three rounds. Then five. Then a “culture fit” panel with four vacant-eyed chimps in fleece vests asking what kind of office fruit best represents your work style. Banana, motherfucker. Because this entire process is BANANAS.
You jump through flaming hoops for a job that requires 3 years of experience and offers $17/hour and a ping pong table. And then?
Ghosted. Again.
No closure. No feedback. Just digital tumbleweed and a deep, echoing FUCK YOU from the void.

And you dare to call yourself “human resources”?
Human fucking garbage.
You’re not resources. You’re roadblocks with wifi.
You don’t hire. You don’t help. You don’t build shit. You exist to cover corporate asses and collect paychecks for doing absolutely fuck-all. You are the rusted gears in the machine. The used condom in the org chart. The wet sock of professional interaction.

And let’s talk about these internships that require 2–3 years of experience.
What in the fetal fuck are you smoking? That’s not an internship, that’s a low-key indentured servitude scam with an NDA. You want college students to have portfolios, projects, and a decade of unpaid labor before you even look at them—and pay them in exposure and a water bottle with the company logo on it?
Fuck off.
Actually no—fuck off, step on a rake, and fall into a pit of boiling LinkedIn endorsements.

You’re not hiring.
You’re LARPing as job creators while you swim through the resumes of desperate humans trying to survive and then toss them out like yesterday’s fucking sandwich crusts.

Every HR person I’ve ever met has had the warmth of a dead shark and the depth of a Pinterest quote. They smile like they practice in the mirror. They write rejection emails with all the human connection of a fax machine having a seizure.

So, in conclusion:

HR reps, recruiters, fake jobs, unpaid internships, and your “people-first culture” can all get aggressively, repeatedly, and unapologetically fucked.
You are a scam.
You are a disease.
You are the reason people fantasize about unplugging their routers and moving into the woods with a hatchet.

Get fucked.
Stay fucked.
Choke on your mission statement.

Lately, shit has hit the fan at my school, and a group of people in my theatre class are in big shit. They’ve done quite a bit and the school is looking into everything. Already wasn’t the biggest fan of them due to their cockiness and thinking they’re all that (they are not good actors by any means, decent at best), but they also said horrible things about our director which led to her resignation. She specifically told me that it wasn’t looking good for our director after they wrote stuff about her to the Ap. We’re now stressed out like crazy for our next season as it’s many of our senior years, but we may not even have a director. The girl (17f) that is apart this group recently logged into another students messages on a school computer and went through all of them with her friends, sharing the messages and so forth. She is probably in some very deep shit and I personally think that she might deserve it. By no means am I a perfect person myself, I’ve done my own fair share of bad things and I understand that. While I was at this coffee shop, the girl and some of her friends were there ordering and chatting. I sat on the sofa and was talking to my mom while on my phone just waiting for them to hurry up so I could go on with my day, no plans of saying anything to them and just minding my own business. Then her and her friends started whispering, and kept glancing back at me while giggling and laughing, so I kinda assume they were talking about me and/or my mom. They sat down after they got their order and I went and grabbed my coffee.

The drive back gave me plenty to commiserate on. Mainly, my own situation and how awful things have gone.

Even if the lingering strangeness was expressed by a simple seismograph that was on the fritz or a simple error that could be fixed? The fact remained that the land I had been graciously gifted was now sitting on some kind of fault line. Even if I got everything put together to sell it, who would I sell it to? Who would want land on what is a place now in danger of being crushed under a rock slide? I guess you could build it out but even then, the situation was dreadful.

I soon discovered someone was having an even worse day than I.

The town I was near was small enough, as said. It saw a decent amount of visitors who were passing off the major highway nearby to get gas or sleep for the night but this place was hardly big enough to support a large population. This fact is important as when I spied the exit to the town, I saw a lot more lights and cars then I'm used to. Helicopters flew overhead with all manner of numbers of them. Five, Seven, Nine. Eleven. All news channels. All covering something that I had missed.

I drove down the road, passing by the local diner. The place, a nice little hovel called Tammy's, had become the makeshift headquarters. Tammy's served the sixth best coffee in the state by diner standards and they didn't seem to pass up the chance to deepen their pockets. Curious and considering work wouldn't need me for another two weeks, I ventured in to see what was happening.

The diner was packed though I was lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar counter. There'd be no quick service but it did give me the chance to speak to the man sitting next to me. Balding, a tough exterior and a tired expression, bags under his eyes as he rubbed his face. Seemed coffee couldn't get to him fast enough. ""Hey, excuse me; Sorry to bother but what's going on?""

""Hell you mean what's going on? You didn't feel it?"" the man asked, calloused fingers rubbing over his face as he did his best to shake the sleep off his tanned face.

""Feel...what?""

Mumbling to himself, the man continued to explain. ""Fuckin' crazy shit. There I was, driving my eighteen-wheeler, trying to make it to the fuckin' depot before noon so I can get my ass some sleep before my next haul. Whole fuckin' ground shakes. In the middle of fuckin' America. We ain't California.""

""Wait, the ground was shaking?"" In my entire drive here, I hadn't felt a single thing. Much less a supposed earthquake.

He hadn't seemed surprised by confusion. ""Yep, get this shit; was localized or some science nonsense. Earthquakes supposed to be felt for miles but this? Didn't go much further than town. Still fucked me over though, broke the axle on my damn semi. Course, who am I to bitch, some got it worse...""

Our conversation was briefly interrupted by the waitress looking haggered. I paid for the man's coffee while I got some myself. It was the least I could do for the information that was looking a bit too relevant for my tastes. As she shuffled off, I turned back to him. ""Worse?""

A languid sigh. ""Yeah, poor bastard. Guy lived on the lake. Part of the fuckin' mountain slid down, destroyed his house. Was inside it. Think it was instant. HOPE it was instant.""

My stomach dropped. ""Was his name Jeff?""

""Yeah, yeah. Jeff somethin'. Jeff Killian? Jeff Killan? I'unno."" The man got his coffee, the most important ambrosia in the world to him as the waitress dropped two menus in front of us in slapdash fashion. ""Here I am bitchin' about getting chewed out and that guy's dead. Probably why the news is here, eh? First earthquake death in the state's history.""

God damn it.

I finished my orange juice and thanked the man. His name was Vince. Good guy. I hope he made his delivery on time. I moved out of the packed diner as quickly as I could. I had taken most of my things out of the house but right now, I was more curious if the house was still there. Traffic was packed to the brim as well, the two-lane roads not built for the traffic of the news event of the month.

After about an hour trying to drive a mile and a half out of town, I found my way to the dirt road to my gifted home...only to see it blocked off. Cop cars here and there, along with emergency response teams. Nothing seemed dangerous but they were probably there to facilitate evacuations should they find anyone or have to rescue anyone. That's not even counting the various news teams acquiring B-roll footage for the nightly broadcast.

My house was another five minute drive away but there was no way I was going to get my car past there. Hopes were resting on any sort of altruistic cop who may be willing to escort me home. If there was a home left to go to. A small tent had been set up nearby, flood lights being set up for the long night. I parked my car nearby and headed over.

I didn't make it far before one of those non-altruistic cops stopped me. ""Hey, buddy, you can't be here. Search and rescue or law enforcement only.""

""No, I get that. Sorry, listen; my house is right next to the..."" What was it? Accident? Crime scene? Disaster spot? Wreckage? ""...the place that got crushed by the mudslide.""

The cop exhaled. ""Are you family to the deceased?""

""No sir."" I could have lied but my curiosity wasn't so deep that a jail sentence was worth taking a look.

""Alright, look; I can't—"" The man began before another walked over. Compared to the local cop, this man was far more well-put together. A white collared shirt and bright blue tie, along with black business pants. Instantly the other cop seemed annoyed. ""I got it, Duyos, you don't need to worry about this guy.""

""On the contrary, officer, this fortunately saves me a phone call or two."" Duyos stepped over to me, offering a hand. ""Alexander Duyos. I'm with the state disaster response. Overheard the discussion; the house that's by the lake is yours, right?""

I took the hand in a firm shake, Alex smiling at me with pristine white teeth. ""Yeah. Family offering.""

His expression shifted from warm greeting to dire, the kind of face one would expect when the doctor told you something was inoperable or lethal. ""Mmm, that's a lot of misfortune. I hope you're not planning on going home and getting into bed, are you?""

""Nothing of the sort. Actually I found things shifting about a day or so ago and—""

""A day ago? Hm. Might have been the prelude. Hell, maybe god's watching over you if you got out. Your house is still there but we can't let you stay there, of course."" I hadn't expected to. ""Though I'll tell you what; how about I go with you and we can take a look from afar. Kind of my job to know how safe a domicile is. If all's well, we can get your things out. Deal?""

""Deal."" I had no desire to fight on this and maybe an extra set of hands might help me here.

""Good to hear. What's your name?"" he asked, beckoning me over to a black, heavy-duty truck. The behemoth of a Ford seemed more befitting for assaulting a compound than getting up the mountain.

We both slipped into the car, buckling my seatbelt. ""Henry. Henry Alberto.""

""Oh, Italian! Maybe Spanish? Ha, either way, good to meet you, Henry."" The truck roared to life as we made our way down the short drive to my home. ""So you're telling me you felt tremors the day before? Were they...how can I put it? Any time apart? Were they like contractions?""

""No, nothing of the sort,"" I responded. ""Actually, I only noticed when some of my property shifted a bit. Fence was the start of it.""

""Huh. Only the fence...little movement? That's pretty strange, don't you think?"" Alex offered, spinning the steering wheel. ""I will say that it IS your lucky day all things nonwithstanding. See, the state's not going to be able to let you live here in an active danger zone. Shocking, I know.""

I leaned my head to the side at a curve, seeing if I could get a glimpse of the changes or damages. Nothing so far. ""Is the good news staying at a hotel? Because I already got a room for a bit.""

""No, I mean an actually lucky break Mister Alberto. The government isn't going to leave you out to dry. In fact, we're willing to buy your property at a premium and a half. So many zeros your head'll spin!"" Alex laughed, turning down the radio a little. The radio was set to some local news station, already spouting off about the earthquake. ""It'll take a while for the paperwork but you can bet you're going to get an offer with a lot more meat than you'd expect.""

That was indeed a lucky break. With enough, I may be able to even quit working all together. Maybe buy a nice house elsewhere. Despite the luck of the break, something felt...off. I couldn't put my finger on it, probably due to the strangeness of the ""earthquake"" here. Still, being offered what sounded like a blank check for my property from the government seemed a bit sketchy. Though compared to how the government is portrayed in stories, Alex seemed a bit more cordial than holding me at gunpoint.

""I'll have to think about it, if that's ok,"" I responded.

""Suit yourself, but I don't think you'll get a better offer. I'll give you my card after we look at your place so you can contact me if you change your mind."" The conversation ended at quite the opportune time as we parked in front of my house, cops and workers swarming more around the house a few yards away than my own. ""Though I can see why you wouldn't want to give it up. Prime real estate right here, hell...""

I spared a glance over to Jeff's house. I kind of wish I hadn't. Caution tape was strung up haphazardly around the trees in an effort to cordon off the wreckage, the workers there being exceedingly cautious about moving or touching anything. One would have expected the house to land in the lake or be little more than a pile of wood. The actual result was that the house seemed to have ""folded"" in on itself and slid down, crumpling like a car wreck. From the corner of my eye, I saw some wood stained a slightly darker shade that made my skin crawl.

The hand on my shoulder brought me out of the stupor, Alex giving a grim look. ""Shit way to go, really. Poor guy. I need to get in touch with his family, see about getting their land too."" It was a heartless way to talk about a man who had just died but he was right; coming here to rebuild in defiance of nature was only going to result in more funerals. ""I'll leave you to getting your stuff. Let me know if you need extra hands or anything of the sort, alright? Don't wait too long, no idea if there'll be...I don't know. Another aftershock?""

He was right on that as well. I couldn't linger too long. I went into my house to grab some more clothes. The inside was a mess, considering there had been something akin to an earthquake here. My furniture was knocked over, a few glass shards from a glss I had left out on the counter and some of my things overturned. Perhaps that's where this would have ended if I only picked up my clothes and left. Perhaps in another life I got my things, sold my land and lived comfortably in an expansive mansion on the beach.

Instead, I saw the tree.

While working to gather my things, I paid one longing look to my backyard. What a disaster. The fence I spent hours putting up was in shambles and most of my backyard had been torn up by the movement. It sucked, to be sure, but what really drew my attention was the ancient tree. Fortune had saved my house from being crushed by both the earthquake and the tree.

But what really drew my eyes were the roots. The tree had been a timeless thing with roots that dug deep into the ground. Roots that were now torn up and on display for the world to see. Roots that had entertwined around...something. I looked behind me, making sure Alex couldn't see me. Last thing I wanted was to get howled at for putting myself in danger. I quietly opened the backdoor and slipped my way to the overturned tree.

What had caught my eye was something deeply entangled in the oldest roots, roots that were more akin to rock and stone than any sort of organic structure. It seemed that when the earthquake had happened, whatever it had been wrapped around those roots was torn up with it. A weird, red-and-blue lump the size of a watermelon. It took a bit of elbow grease to tear it from the roots but once I did, the thing landing in my hands.

And it was wet.

I grimaced, feeling it over. Wet and sticky. No ore that I knew of was like this to be sure. Worse yet, it didn't even remind me of ore. The blue layer on the top with the sticky light-red beneath it reminded me less of a rock and more of a piece of meat.

Again, paranoia and madness would have driven me to saying that I had discovered tree meat. But I didn't want to jump to that conclusion yet. Maybe Ursula would have a better idea of what this was? I stuffed the gross lump into my belongings bag after wrapping it in a work shirt I was sure I wasn't going to ever wear again.

I snuck back inside only to be greeted by Alex, giving a friendly way despite him clearly snooping on me. ""Hey, I was looking for you. Wanted to take a peek before we left."" He ran a hand along my countertop as if he was testing the stability. ""Damn shame about the house, were you working on it yourself?""

""Yeah, docks too,"" I conversed, adjusting my bag. Something about him chasing after me rubbed me the wrong way but I had a bit too many questions on my mind to linger on ""why is a government employee looking for me"". That one at least had more plausible explanations.

""Shame. Lovely lake."" The two of us began walking back to his truck where I carefully stowed the strange-rock-thing without his knowledge. As I got in the car, he'd hum to himself. ""Say, Henry, you know this lake used to belong to some indians? Sorry, Indiginous people. Old man, old habits you know?""

""It's alright,"" I offered, eager to distract. ""But yeah, I did know that. Why?""

The truck bumped and bounced as it moved down the road, dominating underbrush and dirt as it went. ""Cool legend about the lake, you know. Those people really believed the land was part of the spirit world! To them, it was like a god. Sort of. Anyways, the lake? It was said that the lake was the eye of god, beautiful and blue. Pretty neat, huh?""

""Huh, yeah, I guess."" It was an interesting tidbit of trivia. A bit of trivia that didn't seem to warrant the way he looked at me. It was the look of someone who kept turning to you while you watched their favorite movie. A look of ""Did you see that?"" or ""Wasn't that cool?"". Your reaction more interesting to them than the movie itself. ""...Why?""

""Bah, small talk,"" he offered. ""If it was true, guess when we're out on the lake we're kind of like those little squiggles in your eye. Except the person who has the eye is god. But I guess nobodys ever been smitten...smote...smited? Nobody ever suffered the wrath of god fishing. Unless you're one of those Alaskan crab fishers, eh? That'd be Poseidon, actually.""

The small talk was unbearable.

Once we made it to my car, I gave a quick wave before heading back to my motel, eager to escape the poor attempts at small talk and comedy as I drove. I parked in the lot but wasn't quite sure if I should go inside yet. I considered what to do. Sit and wait? Ursula would call me back but her work was probably abuzz now. Maybe go back and see her? See if she knew what kind of rock this was? I wasn't sure just yet.

There was a noise from my bag. A noise I didn't exactly recognize. Not the shifting of materials or a simple shift. No, this was more...wet. Like the squelching noise of a wet item slapping against something. I grimaced, thinking that maybe a water bottle had broken. It would just be my luck.

I stepped out of my car and opened my trunk, going through my bag. The contents of my stored items were now a bit more soggy but taht part didn't bother me. What did bother me was the stench. Bile and gore, like I had a slaughtered cow in my backpack. I wretched, almost closing it before I saw the bundled up tree-thing.

There, sticking out of the bundle, was a long red tube. I watched it for a second before I saw it grow, moving outward in no specific direction. My innards twisted as I saw this ropelike thing reach out. Meat. It had to be meat. My mind was made up. I got in my car and left the motel, immediately driving to a nearby gas station. I bought a cheap plastic cooler and jammed my whole bag in it, slamming it shut and taping it for good measure.

It took another half hour to get out of town due to the traffic but I was already on the highway back to the geology center. I didn't know where else to go really.

Whatever was in that cooler was still moving and all I knew is that someone else had to have answers.",1,1746740303.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

we have went out 2 more times alone during the morning and he has still not made a single move and we have been really close for the past 2 months. idk what to do bc this whole thing i’m guessing clearly isn’t just a fried thing to him but the problem is i dont know the reason why he hasn’t made a move and i’m not sure wether he isn’t making a kove because he really likes me and wants to go slow or because he wants to know me better or if he is just fucking with me bc he is bored.

i’ve also seen his texts in the only girl he’s talking with and even tho i can make a move i don’t want to because i want to see the move from HIM so i know what’s really going on. also today we went out and even tho we usually always talk from messages after he hasn’t texted me but he has sent me tiktoks and responded to those i’ve sent to him.

what can i do? why has it been 2 months and he hasn’t made a single move? all the things that are happening are showing that he is into me but isn’t 2 months abit too much? i need ur opinions please

## Key Features Analysis

The modern electric kettle with temperature control offers sophisticated features to optimize the user experience.

**Precise Temperature Control:** Detailed temperature settings are the cornerstone of these kettles, with many models offering incremental adjustments, typically in 1-degree Celsius or 5-degree Fahrenheit increments. This allows for selecting the ideal water temperature for specific types of tea (e.g.,green tea at 80°C,black tea at 95°C) and coffee brewing methods (e.g., pour-over at 93°C).

Modern electric kettles utilize advanced thermistors, which are highly sensitive thermal resistors that accurately measure the water temperature. These thermistors are connected to a digital control panel, which allows the user to set the desired temperature. A microprocessor within the kettle monitors the thermistor readings and adjusts the heating element accordingly to maintain the set temperature. This precise control is far superior to the guesswork involved with traditional stovetop kettles or basic electric kettles lacking temperature adjustment features.

**Keep-Warm Function:** Many models include a keep-warm function that maintains the selected temperature for a set duration, usually 30 to 60 minutes.This prevents the need to reheat the water repeatedly, conserving energy and saving time.The keep-warm function operates by cycling the heating element on and off to compensate for heat loss to the habitat. the microprocessor monitors the water temperature via the thermistor and activates the heating element briefly when the temperature drops below a predefined threshold (e.g., 2-3 degrees Celsius below the set point). This cycle maintains the water at or near the target temperature without boiling it further, which could alter the taste or evaporate the water.

**material Quality and Construction:** Electric kettles with temperature control are often constructed from high-quality materials such as stainless steel, borosilicate glass, or BPA-free plastic. Stainless steel interiors are favored for their durability, resistance to corrosion, and lack of flavor transfer to the water.Borosilicate glass offers a visually appealing design and allows users to monitor the water level, while BPA-free plastic ensures safety and prevents harmful chemicals from leaching into the water.

These kettles are engineered with robust construction to withstand repeated heating and cooling cycles. Stainless steel kettles are typically constructed from 304 or 316 grade stainless steel. Borosilicate glass kettles are made from heat-resistant glass which can withstand rapid temperature changes without cracking. BPA-free plastic components are carefully selected for their thermal stability and chemical inertness.

**Safety features:** Safety is paramount in electric kettle design. Features such as automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and stay-cool handles or exteriors are standard.Automatic shut-off turns the kettle off when the water reaches the set temperature or if the kettle is lifted from its base during operation. Boil-dry protection prevents the kettle from overheating and potentially damaging the heating element if it is indeed accidentally turned on without water.

These safety mechanisms are implemented using various sensors and circuits. Automatic shut-off is typically triggered by a steam sensor located near the kettle's lid. When steam is detected after the water boils, the sensor activates a switch that cuts off the power to the heating element. Boil-dry protection relies on a thermal cutoff switch that monitors the temperature of the heating element. If the element gets to hot due to lack of water, the switch automatically shuts off the kettle.

**programmable Presets:** For added convenience, some kettles offer programmable presets for specific beverages or purposes. Common presets include green tea, black tea, oolong tea, coffee, and boiling. These presets automatically set the ideal temperature for each request, eliminating the need for manual adjustment.

Programmable presets simplify the process of brewing different types of beverages by storing predefined temperature settings in the kettle's memory. The user simply selects the appropriate preset, and the kettle automatically heats the water to the associated temperature. The underlying technology involves a microcontroller that stores the preset temperatures and controls the heating element accordingly.

Key features of electric kettles with temperature control include:

*   Precise Temperature Settings
*   Keep-Warm Function
*   Material Quality and Construction
*   Safety features

## Core Benefits

Electric kettles with temperature control offer significant advantages and enhance the user experience.

**Optimized Beverage Flavor:** Precise temperature control eliminates burning or scalding ingredients, resulting in improved flavor profiles. Different types of tea and coffee require specific water temperatures to release optimal flavors and aromas. Using the correct temperature prevents bitterness in green tea, ensures proper extraction of coffee grounds, and enhances the overall taste experience.

Brewing green tea using boiling water can result in a bitter and astringent taste because the high temperature releases tannins. By using a kettle with temperature control to heat the water to around 80°C (176°F), the tea's delicate flavors are preserved, leading to a smoother and more enjoyable cup. Similarly, using water that is too hot for coffee brewing can cause over-extraction, resulting in a bitter and harsh taste.

**Enhanced convenience and Time Savings:** Electric kettles with temperature control boil water much faster than stovetop kettles and offer convenient features like automatic shut-off and keep-warm functions. Heating water on a stovetop can take significantly longer, especially for larger volumes of water. Electric kettles, particularly those with high wattage heating elements, can boil the same amount of water in a fraction of the time. The automatic shut-off and keep-warm features further enhance convenience by eliminating the need to monitor the kettle and reheat the water repeatedly.A typical electric kettle with a 1500-watt heating element can boil one liter of water in approximately 3-4 minutes.Compared to heating the same amount of water on a stovetop, the electric kettle saves considerable time and requires less supervision. The user can set the desired temperature, turn on the kettle, and attend to other tasks while the water heats up automatically.

**Energy Efficiency:** Electric kettles with temperature control are designed for energy efficiency, minimizing wasted energy and reducing electricity consumption. They only heat the water needed,unlike stovetop kettles where excess water may be heated.The keep-warm function, while consuming some energy, is more efficient than repeatedly boiling water from cold.

Modern electric kettles are designed with insulated walls and bottoms to minimize heat loss to the environment. This insulation reduces the amount of energy required to maintain the water temperature. Additionally, certain kettles feature sensors that detect the water level and adjust the heating element's power output accordingly, further optimizing energy usage.

## FAQs Section

**Is the Breville BKE820XL Electric Kettle compatible with different voltages?**
The Breville BKE820XL is designed for use with standard North American voltage (110-120V).Using it with different voltages without a proper voltage converter can damage the kettle and void the warranty. Always check the voltage requirements before using the kettle in a different region.

Attempting to plug the Breville BKE820XL,which is rated for 120V,into a 220V outlet (common in Europe) will result in excessive current flow through the heating element. This can rapidly overheat and burn out the element, rendering the kettle unusable. It could also potentially pose a fire hazard.

**How easy is it to clean a stainless steel electric kettle with temperature control?**
Cleaning a stainless steel electric kettle typically involves descaling to remove mineral deposits that accumulate over time. This can be done using vinegar or a commercially available descaling solution. Simply fill the kettle with a mixture of equal parts vinegar and water, boil it, and let it sit for about 30 minutes before rinsing thoroughly. For minor stains, a soft cloth and mild soap can be used to wipe the exterior.

the buildup of mineral deposits, such as calcium and magnesium, is a natural consequence of boiling water, especially hard water. Descaling is crucial to maintaining the kettle's performance and preventing mineral deposits from affecting the taste of the water. Regular descaling, typically every 1-3 months depending on water hardness, is recommended.

**What are the safety features of the Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp Cordless Electric Kettle?**
the Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp Cordless Electric Kettle includes several safety features, such as automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and a stay-cool handle.the automatic shut-off feature turns the kettle off once the set temperature is reached or if the kettle is lifted from the base during operation. The boil-dry protection prevents the kettle from overheating if there is no water in the kettle. The stay-cool handle helps prevent burns from the hot kettle surface.

The cuisinart CPK-17 employs a bimetallic strip thermostat that triggers the automatic shut-off mechanism. When the water reaches the selected temperature, the bimetallic strip bends due to the heat, activating a switch that cuts off the power supply to the heating element. The boil-dry protection utilizes a thermal cutoff switch located near the heating element. If the element's temperature exceeds a predetermined threshold (indicating a lack of water to dissipate the heat), the switch automatically cuts off the power.

*There before the grace of God; no, we are not*. -Me

  
Well, we're changing it up for a one-time event! **Saturday, May 17th, 10am - 3pm**, we're going to be open and doing a combination business/employee garage-style sale! All of the things we no longer do are going to be displayed for your perusal. What can you expect to find? 

... Good question. I have no idea. We've got tons of faucets that are discontinued that are being sold off, hundreds of toilets with the same reason. We'll also have all the old-Saffron materials up for grabs, ranging from random hand tools and accessories to weird items like smudge pots we found in a basement and have no idea where they came from. Also some backpack sprayers, vehicle jacks, light bulbs, air filters, Christmas lights (I'm not joking), and I found one rusted cooking pan that everyone is confused by.

We'll also have some employees and family members bringing whatever they want to sell. Because organizing a garage sale is an absolute nightmare, we're helping employees out by letting them sell their stuff at this event without the hassle of trying to do it themselves. Clothing, furniture, NOT a copy of the movie Serenity on DVD in widescreen (I called dibs on that, *you can't take the sky from me*), and whatever else they dream up.

  
Nothing's off limits! We're making space as we grow and get better at what we do with all things water. We're also hoping to have our coffee shop friends, Coffee Near Me, open and running as well. They'll be slinging the best coffee in the entire universe (so I'm told, I just drink green tea, but they've assured me it's very good) to fuel that impulsive shopping spree.

We're looking forward to seeing you there! Also, all employees on site are going to be there as a volunteer basis (they're getting comped a day off in the future), so if one of our prestigious Saffron representatives is sleeping in a corner somewhere; let em rest. 



Thank you, Salem!

But instead, I just got curious. Asked myself why this tiny thing felt so huge. Turns out that spilled coffee was just the last straw after weeks of feeling overlooked at work. Not about the coffee at all.

1ki1jy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1ki1jy8/best_technologies_that_produce_artificial_bright/,Best technologies that produce artificial bright light like the sun without the disadvantages to improve circadian rhythm as soon as you wake up.,"Waking up to bright light that feels like sunlight is one of the most powerful ways to tell your body it’s time to be alive, alert, and full of energy. But not all light is created equal—some indoor lights can actually confuse your brain, mess with your sleep, and dull your mood. Luckily, there are amazing technologies now that bring the feeling of real sunlight indoors, giving you that natural boost first thing in the morning without any of the damage or circadian disruption. These lights don’t just shine—they work with your biology, waking up your body the way nature intended.

Full-spectrum human-centric lighting is at the top. These lights mimic sunlight from dawn to dusk, including parts of the spectrum we don’t even see like near-UV and infrared. They change color and brightness as the day goes on, starting cool and bright to lift your morning energy, then slowly warming into the evening to help your brain wind down. Companies like Signify (Philips) and BIOS Lighting, which is inspired by NASA tech, are leading the way. These systems are designed not just to light up a room, but to align your internal clock and improve your mood, focus, and sleep.

Even more accessible are tunable white LED lights that you can adjust yourself. You can start your morning with a bright, cool 6500K light that mimics the noonday sun and really kicks your system into gear. As the day winds down, you just dial it down to a warmer, softer glow around 2700K to avoid suppressing melatonin, the hormone that helps you sleep. Smart lighting brands like LIFX, Philips Hue, and BIOS SkyBlue even sync with your daily rhythms automatically.

For people struggling with winter blues or sluggish mornings, special bright light therapy lamps (also called SAD lamps) can work wonders. They give off 10,000 lux of light—like a blast of morning sun right into your biology—and they’re best used early in the day. Some brands like Carex or Verilux make it easy to add this little ritual to your morning routine, giving you more energy and improving mood within days. And for next-level biohackers or researchers, solar simulators and near-infrared panels can even simulate full sunlight including healing infrared, helping your cells recharge and recover like you’ve been outside.

Imagine waking up and your room slowly glows like a rising sun, your body naturally waking up, your brain feeling clear, your mood already lifted before coffee. That’s the power of proper indoor lighting that respects your biology. With the right mix of full-spectrum, adjustable LEDs, and a smart schedule, you can turn any home into a sunlight sanctuary. It’s not just about seeing better—it’s about living better, every single day.",1,1746739123.0,immortalists,1,1.0,False
1ki1jgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/YauponHollyTea/comments/1ki1jgh/yaupons_buzz_hits_different_for_me_what_about_you/,Yaupon’s buzz hits different for me — what about you?,"I’ve been drinking yaupon pretty regularly for a few years now, and I still find the way it makes me feel pretty unique compared to coffee or traditional tea.

There’s definitely caffeine in it — you can feel the mental lift — but what stands out to me is how smooth and sustained the energy is. I’ve read that yaupon also contains theobromine (like in chocolate) and theacrine, which might explain the calmer, longer-lasting effect. For me, it’s this weirdly ideal combo: focused and alert, but without the jittery edge or sudden crash.

I usually brew it like a loose-leaf tea, sometimes hot, sometimes iced, and it’s become my default when I want to be productive without overdoing it.

Just wondering if others here drink yaupon and notice the same kind of buzz? Or does it hit everyone a little differently? Curious how others brew it or if anyone mixes it with other herbs.

With its sleek black design, programmable features, and a promise to eliminate the need for a carafe, I was both excited and skeptical to try this product. Testing it during the early hours of my frantic mornings and lazy weekends revealed its quirks, charms, and moments that left me scratching my head.

**Design and Functionality**  
One of the immediate attractions to this coffee maker is its modern aesthetic. It looks great in any kitchen, and the stainless-steel accents give it a slightly premium feel. Beyond the visual appeal, the layout is intuitive. The control panel has an easy-to-read LCD screen displaying time and brewing settings, which saves me from squinting at it pre-coffee. The removable water reservoir, alongside the drip tray and coffee reservoir, is incredibly convenient for cleaning and usage. These small design choices make a noticeable difference when you’re rushing to refill or clean up after a busy morning.  

**Key Benefits**
- Fully programmable functions, allowing advanced brew start.
- One-cup dispensing makes it ideal for single-use without waste.
- Charcoal water filter significantly improves taste by eliminating chlorine and other impurities.  

**Performance**  
Performance-wise, this machine wins some points for consistency. I’ve used it to brew smaller amounts of coffee using the 1–4 cup setting, and it consistently delivers a rich and flavorful brew. The double-wall reservoir keeps the coffee hot for hours; this has been super useful when I have a chaotic work schedule that doesn’t adhere to coffee breaks. However, the ""coffee gauge"" feature is my personal favorite – knowing exactly how much coffee is left in the tank without opening it? That’s a touch of genius, especially for someone like me who hates finding an empty machine when I'm craving coffee.

[Check Cuisinart DCC-3000P1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b005ir4w7w/)

**User Experience**  
The dispenser lever is straightforward to use and prevents spills, which is especially appreciated when my kids or groggy relatives are trying to fix themselves a cup. Its illuminated pour area is a nice touch, particularly when sneaking a cup in the dim glow of early mornings. Everyone in my household has adjusted to the machine quite seamlessly. The audible tone notifying the end of a brew cycle is loud enough but not obnoxious.  

With that said, I have encountered some quirks. Coffee grounds tend to accumulate around the exit valve of the coffee reservoir over time – requiring me to rinse it with some effort. It’s not a huge issue, but on lazy days, the maintenance aspect can feel a little tedious.

**Downsides**
- Coffee grounds occasionally build up near the valve, making cleanup necessary.
- While BPA-free, the plastic elements don't feel as durable compared to the metal accents.
  
**Alternative Offerings**  
In comparison to other drip coffee machines such as the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew or Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Maker, the coffee maker stands out for ditching the carafe entirely and introducing features like the coffee gauge and advanced programmability. However, if you’re looking for something even simpler or with fewer moving parts, one of those options might appeal. The Hamilton Beach model, for instance, excels in versatility as it brews K-Cups and full pots. While the Cuisinart DCC-3000P1 isn’t as versatile, it nails flavor consistency and offers a carafe-less experience that competitors often lack.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For its price range, I’d say it offers pretty solid value. Between its programmable features, stylish design, and clever storage solutions, the investment feels worthwhile for casual drinkers and coffee enthusiasts alike. While cheaper models exist, the additional perks and a better taste profile thanks to the built-in charcoal water filter justify a slightly higher commitment. Still, it may not be the best fit for someone on a tight budget looking for absolute simplicity.

1ki1gdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ki1gdf/i_dont_think_im_me/,I don’t think I’m me.,"I know that sounds strange—and yeah, if I heard someone else say it, I’d probably tell them to see a psychiatrist. But it’s true. I would never wear a striped sweater. And definitely not on a random day in July. I don’t even own striped sweaters.

Yet there I was, in a photo inside a photo album my best friend’s mom was showing me—grinning in a red-and-blue striped knit like it belonged on me. And that wasn’t the only strange thing.

Earlier this week, I came home from a month-long work trip. I was exhausted, dragging my suitcase through the door when my girlfriend greeted me.

“Hey, baby—I made your favorite meal. Eat it before it gets cold. I’m gonna go run a bath for us,” Amy called over her shoulder.

Chicken Parmesan.

I didn’t think much of it at the time. I was tired, hungry, and honestly touched by the gesture. I sat down and inhaled the food without hesitation. It was good—really good.

Too good.

Halfway through rinsing my plate, it hit me: I don’t even like chicken.
I never have. I haven’t eaten it since I was a kid. The texture makes my skin crawl.

So why the hell did I eat an entire plate of it without even noticing?

I shook it off. Jet lag, maybe. Or maybe I was just being dramatic. I got in the shower with Amy, didn’t say anything, and we went to bed.

The next morning, I was getting ready for work when Amy tossed me my keys and kissed me goodbye. I caught them midair and headed downstairs. Halfway I felt them in my hand, something was off. The grooves, the weight. They weren’t mine.

I looked down.
Honda keys.

I rushed back up the stairs.

“Whose keys are these?” I asked, trying not to sound as shaken as I felt.

Amy looked up from her coffee, brow furrowing. “What?”

“These keys, Amy. They’re not mine. I drive a Toyota—so whose are these? Don’t play dumb.”

She blinked. “Honey, are you feeling okay? Those are your keys, stupid,” she said with a soft laugh.

“No, they’re not.” My voice dropped cold.

Without saying a word, Amy disappeared into the hallway, then returned holding a framed picture.

“That’s you,” she said, handing it to me.

In the photo, I was standing next to a shiny new Honda Civic at a dealership. Huge smile. Handshake with the salesman. Wearing—of course—a striped sweater.

“That was six months ago, babe. When I surprised you with the car. Do you seriously not remember?”

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. That was me. My face, my grin, my stance. But it felt like I was looking at a stranger with my skin.

I hurried into the bedroom, pulled open the closet—and froze.

Dozens of sweaters. Striped, patterned, holiday-themed. My entire wardrobe looked like an ugly sweater convention.

Amy followed me in, concern all over her face.
“Jamie, are you okay? You’re starting to worry me.”

“I’m fine,” I lied. “Just didn’t sleep well.” I said
Even though I slept like a baby. 

I kissed her on the cheek and left for work. Outside, the Civic sat gleaming in the driveway. It looked familiar now. I got in—it smelled like me. Air fresheners, black tree scent. LED lights under the dash. Everything clean and organized. Exactly as I would have it. 

But it still felt wrong. Like I was stepping into someone else’s life who just happened to be me.

I arrived at the office late, feeling hazy. As I settled into my usual desk, a voice interrupted me.

“Jamie, you’re at my desk,” said Andrew, my annoying coworker.

I looked up. “What? No, I’ve always sat here. Just because I’ve been gone for a while doesn’t mean you can steal my desk, Mountain Drew.”

“Mountain Drew? Seriously?” he muttered, pushing up his glasses.

We had a bit of a back and forth and Ten minutes later, I was in HR.

“Do you know what your position is here?” the woman behind the desk asked.

“Of course,” I said. “I’m in charge of the Orbus Project.”

“And what does that entail?” she asked, typing something.

I opened my mouth. Closed it. Then opened it again.

“I…attend meetings, organize…wait.”
I blinked.

“What is the relevance of this question?” I deflected.

“Well,” she said, swiveling her monitor slightly, “you’re in the wrong department. Wrong floor, actually. And according to your file, you haven’t been assigned to the Orbus Project. That doesn’t launch for another two months. You were moved to Data Processing last month after your last incident.”

My stomach dropped.

“What incident?”

She scrolled through my record with a practiced sigh. “The one where you were caught dumping unmarked liquid into coworkers’ lunches in the break room. Honestly, you’re lucky you weren’t fired.”

I sat frozen in the chair, every nerve in my body screaming.

“What the hell is happening to me?” 
The words slipped out before I could stop myself. 

“Excuse me?” She asked

My face turned slightly red , “I’m sorry, I’m just having a hard time readjusting after the work trip. “ 

“Okay Mr Jamie, why don’t you just go on ahead back to your proper work area. And try to stay out of trouble please, the paperwork isn’t easy on these old fingers you know. “ 

“Yes of course, thank you.” I said as I quickly and quietly whisked away back into the building. After asking around a bit I finally made it to my actual desk. Everyone on that floor acted as if I belonged there. I got a quick run-down of my tasks and got right to it. Trying to not think about all the bizarre things that happened, I decided to put it out of mind and focus solely on work. 

About 30 minutes before I had to clock out I decided to go through my emails. I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. I checked my drafts and saw my last draft dated on the day I went on to the work trip. 

“ subject : Orbus

: sweet Red. It’s not me. 
Take the call. “ 

It made no sense. But I didn’t know what to make of it. So I just went back to work.  


Besides that first day back , everything else seemed to be running smoothly. I got through the week without any more hiccups. I didn’t mention my apprehension to Amy because she is such a worrywart. 
That was until today. 

I had planned to visit my best friends family for a weekend BBQ-kind of an unofficial celebration for his nieces upcoming graduation. I got there relatively early. Honestly I was looking forward to it. I needed something familiar. But if I thought that today would bring me peace I was wrong. 

The grill was already going when I got there. The scent of charcoal and barbecue sauce hit me before I even stepped out of the car. Kids were running around the yard with water guns, and someone had queued up an early 2000s playlist on a Bluetooth speaker. It felt…right.

I needed this. Familiar faces.  I spotted Marcus—my best friend since middle school—near the back porch, beer in hand, laughing with his cousin. He lit up when he saw me.

“Jamie! Look who finally decided to show up,” he said, pulling me into a quick hug.

“Hey, man. Sorry I’m early—didn’t want to miss the ribs this time.”

“Smart move,” he chuckled. “You’re not still vegetarian, are you?”

That made me pause. “I was never vegetarian,” I said, half-laughing.

He blinked, then shrugged. “Oh right, yeah.” 

The moment passed, but something about it lingered.

I grabbed a plate, made small talk, accepted a drink. For the first time all week, I felt like myself again—until I wandered inside to use the bathroom.

On the hallway wall, right before the guest bathroom, was a photo collage I’d seen a dozen times before. I’d even helped Marcus’s mom hang it last year. But this time, something was off.

At the center of the collage, surrounded by prom photos and school portraits, was a framed picture of me and Marcus at the lake house. I remember that trip—or at least I thought I did.

But in the photo, I was wearing a striped sweater again.
The same red-and-blue one from the dealership photo.

I stared at it for a long time. My arm was around Marcus’s shoulder. We were grinning, beers in hand. But there was something wrong with my face—too wide a smile. Almost…posed. Unnatural.
Why would I even wear a sweater in the sweaty July weather at a Lake anyway? 

“You okay?” a voice said behind me. I jumped.

It was Marcus’s mom, holding a bowl of potato salad. She smiled warmly. “Bathroom’s just there, hon.”

I nodded. “Yeah, thanks. I just—I don’t remember this picture being here.”

She looked at it. “Oh, you two had so much fun that weekend! You don’t remember? We printed that out the same night you all came back. You helped me pick the frame, Jamie.”

“Oh yeah, I must still be tired,” I said quickly, slipping past her into the bathroom and locking the door behind me.

I turned on the sink and stared at myself in the mirror.

Same face. Same eyes.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was looking at someone else.

I washed my face. 

Suddenly, my phone buzzed.
Unknown Number.
The area code was wrong. Too many digits.

I answered without thinking.

“Jamie!” a panicked voice cut through the speaker, echoing in the small bathroom.

“Who is this?” I snapped.

“It’s me—you. I’m you.”

“What? Is this some kind of joke? Marcus, if this is you—”

“No! Please, just listen to me. Don’t hang up. This is important.”

“I need your help. I need to get back. Back to my home.”

“What the hell are you talking about?” I asked

“The Orbus Project—it worked. We opened a gateway. A dimensional gate. But something went wrong. We didn’t know it would swap us. I don’t belong here, and you don’t belong there.”

“No. No, this isn’t real. You’re lying.”

“I swear to you—we don’t have much time. The longer we stay out of sync, the harder it’ll be to return. We’ll be lost, Jamie.”

My head was spinning. “How is this even possible? What went wrong?”

“I don’t know exactly. There were… variables we didn’t account for. But I’ve been working on a fix. I think there’s a way back.”

“How do I know you’re telling the truth?”

“Have you noticed anything strange? People acting like you said or did things you don’t remember? Preferences that don’t feel like yours?”

I hesitated. “…Yeah. I don’t like chicken.”

“I do.”

I swallowed. “This is your world? You’re the one who drives the Honda Civic?”

“Yeah. Amy bought it for me.”

“And the sweaters? What’s with all the striped sweaters?”

“…Sweaters?”

“Your closet’s full of them. And you’re wearing one in every photo. Even at the lake trip last July.”

He paused. Then said;

I am thinking of reaching out to an ex-situationship for an amicable coffee while I visit the city where she lives. 

Breaking up with her was very painful to me. It took me almost 1.5 years to start thinking of her every single day (I know this is too much). By now, I have dealt with most of my attachment issues and am ready to move on emotionally into a relationship with someone else. However, I suddenly, since a few weeks ago I started thinking about this person more and more. On one hand I reflected on how important the trauma was, to trigger personal and spiritual growth on my side. On the other hand, I feel curious to see how she is doing, as well as the traits that made me so attracted or attached to the person.

I am thinking of asking her out for a coffee, and check up how her life is doing and what not. She is generally and interesting person and I would be interested to hear what has been going on. Additionally, I also believe it will help me build a new image of her, that is not the current idealization that exists in my mind.

Most of the tea sold in the U.S. comes from abroad, so this isn’t just a policy story — it’s a real shift that could hit prices and availability for everyday tea drinkers. Just earlier we came across a reddit post that showed just real the impact is and thought it would be worth discussing here (see: r/tea[ The tariff.

We’re wondering: in this kind of trade environment, will more consumers start looking for domestic alternatives like yaupon? Or will most folks stick to their favorites and just absorb the higher costs?

Genuinely curious what people in the tea community think — especially those who’ve seen past disruptions in coffee, tea, or similar categories.

Around 13 years ago, I met G\* on a less than salubrious corner of the internet. I was in my early twenties and he was in his mid-forties. Quickly after we started messaging and sending each other emails, we decided to meet in a bar in the big city that lay between our respective towns at the time, some time around July 2012. After that, we moved on to texts. And when even his texts were grammatically correct and punctuated, I was smitten.

I actually met him for the first time on the metro on the way to the bar we'd chosen. He sat across from me and looked at me like I was treasure. At such a formative age, isn't that the way every young woman wants to be looked at? It really was a ""you had me at hello"" situation. We spent that evening talking and flirting. He was the first man who ever just out and out told me I was pretty. He was the first man who ever made me feel like a woman. 

And when he kissed me in the train station as we made our way to our respective homes, in front of all of those people, my life turned upside down. It was never really the same again and there has never been a day since when I haven't thought about him.

An older and wiser woman would have tired of his bullshit pretty quickly. Over the ensuing weeks, any time we tried to arrange to meet, something would happen on his part. I began to suspect everything wasn't as it seemed. We met once more for coffee. I gave up trying. In the intervening period, my much loved grandmother died. And I'll give him credit where it's due, he was there on the other end of a text whenever I needed him. Not long afterwards, he magically had time on his hands again. I remember it was a Tuesday in the early spring. He picked me up from university in his mid-life crisis sports car. He took me to a cafe for lunch that I'd never be able to afford otherwise. And then he took me to my house in the middle of the day and we made love for the first time on the couch, not able to make it as far as my bedroom, so consumed with lust and desire for each other.

That spring, I turned 21 and told him how funny it would be if he turned up to the bar where I was having my party. I spent the whole night willing him to come. I thought it was supposed to be fun, turning 21. He was never going to show up anyway, but a tiny part of me longed for it. Even though it was the most ridiculous thing anyone's ever heard. 

Our fling went on, our physical connection deepened and he tested my limits. We fucked wherever we could. His flat, my parents house, my student flat that would be just about empty for the summer, hotels and his office. 

And then I met a boy. 

It was bound to happen at some point. This boy was a very nice boy, more suitable in age. I had to tell him off the bat about the clandestine affair I'd been having with a man who was much too old for me. That still didn't put him off. I told G I'd met someone and for most normal people, that would be the end of it, but reader that was never the end. 

I still spoke to G and I hid it. Every time a message from him popped up on my phone, I'd hide it and replied in secret. One night, I went to G's and actually stayed over, which had never actually happened before. 

Inevitably, J found out. But instead of ending our relationship, he was strangely intrigued. What was it about this man that had me in such a chokehold? Well, J, it's something I spent the next 12 years trying to work out.

My romantic relationship with J came to an end but the friendship remained, which I'm entirely grateful for. 

After that, I had a few ill-advised flings, never lasting very long, and still messed around with G and kept in sporadic contact. I still thought about him every day. 

And then, I found myself getting into another serious relationship later that year (this would be 2014). This was the real deal. Cupid's bow hit me. I told myself ""this man is probably the one"". He was normal. Our relationship was stable and healthy for at least the first year. And then the tables turned. It's always the new friend from work, isn't it? The one who's ""just a friend"" but messages him in the middle of the night when she can't sleep. Suddenly, I was the victim. And I once again turned to G for comfort. 

The relationship inevitably blew up when it crossed the line from emotional to physical. They're still together and I'm glad he found more happiness than he ever had with me. 

And so, 2017, I'm sat in G's car. I've been signed off work sick because my life was in freefall. I had to move back into my parents house. 

You'd think I'd stay single and try to work on myself. Ha. 

Instead, I just get myself into another toxic-ass relationship with a control freak who liked to wear women's clothes. Lets call him...Greg. Greg was...a lot. He was a decade older than me and made me feel wanted at a time in my life when on paper, I really wasn't much of a catch. I couldn't even get a credit card. It was the only time in my life I didn't actually feel the need to see or hear from G - because I was addicted to yet another toxic substance that was bad for me. Greg had a temper. Greg had anger issues. Greg would stonewall me and gaslight me. Greg threw things at me when he was annoyed. It took me like... 18 months to end the relationship and when I did, I've never felt relief like it.  
  
And not only did I leave Greg, but I made the decision to leave a career I thought was my dream because it was making me ill. 2019 was in some ways the best and worst year of my life. That summer, I had one of the healthiest relationships I ever had, though it was shortlived, it paved the way for what I knew I needed and deserved. 

G was starting to become something of a distant memory. But when I walked away from my career - he was there again - and we started talking. I went to his house for the first time in about six years. Nothing happened. But I had a rush of dopamine. By this stage, it had been about four years since we'd actually been physical with each other and I was coming to the view that it was now just some kind of weird friendship. 

Covid was a weird one, I started a new exciting career. I met my future husband. I was getting on in life. G and I were in sporadic contact with updates about life. Things were ticking along nicely. I didn't really think about him as often as I had. We'd go months without hearing from each other quite comfortably.

Then, last year, for the first time in nearly five years, I invented a reason to see him because we'd been talking more recently. He looked older. But not any less attractive to me anyway. Nothing happened. But I wanted it to happen.

He wanted to rekindle things, but I was resistant due to impending aforementioned marriage.  
  
And then, in 2025. I relapsed. At the start of the year, I met him for a proper sit down coffee and he told me, plainly, that he wanted me. He'd not had sex with his partner, who he's been with for around a decade, for ""quite some time"". And I was sorely tempted. But then the wheels started turning in my head. Why should I put my life at risk of being upended because his wife isn't fucking him anymore?   
  
I tried to put it out of my mind, I turned it over. Our texts grew more intense. By this stage, it had been a decade since we'd last been physical.  


A month ago, I had some time off work. So did he. It was a stunning Spring day with not a cloud in the sky. He picked me up from the train station in his middle-aged man car and we went for coffee. I got the sense nothing was likely to happen, even though I wanted it to. Very much. And I knew he wanted it to because he told me. After coffee, he drove me to his office. We sat down. He made conversation with me. He padded over to me and held my face in his hands like it was precious metal and he kissed me. And it was the best kiss I've probably ever had in my life. I kissed him back. And in the kiss I wanted him to feel how much I'd wanted this. Other things happened that day too. But this isn't the place for that.   
  
It was my birthday a few days later and he wished me ""happy birthday, young lady"" and oh, how I gushed over it.   
  
But then the breadcrumbing began, and fizzled out.   
  
Most people reading this would have run out of patience after a few months. But here I am all these years later. I've spent time taking stock of my ""relationship"" with G and I know now that without a doubt, I am addicted to this man. Now I have the benefit of having a fully formed frontal lobe, I know that this man took advantage of my youth and naivety. He thinks he still can. But I'm approaching my mid-thirties now. I've been around the block and I know what life's about.

I want out. I feel like I've been imprisoned by my thoughts of him over the last 13 years, even though I know that we will never have a serious or meaningful relationship. I've been unable to fully enjoy any of my subsequent romantic relationships without being haunted by him. We are addicted to the rush that we give each other. I also know that addictions are bad. And unless we abstain from our addictions, we succumb to them in the end. 

When I came to the realisation that I had to get out of this arrangement because of how unhealthy it was, I thought I had to have some kind of reckoning with him to tell him this was over. But I know now, after a conversation with J\* this weekend (my ex-boyfriend and now good friend and the only one who knows about this bullshit from beginning to hopefully the end) as well as some searching online, I don't owe G\* shit. He doesn't need an explanation of my sudden no contact. He's intelligent enough to join the dots. 

Tonight I deleted our chat history from my phone. I blocked his number. And I deleted it. I'm done. I quit for good this time. And it's going to be so \_fucking\_ hard because this guy has literally been present in the majority of my adult life so far. But it needs to happen so I can start to heal and move on with my life. 

I hope this offers some hope to others who are in a kind of similar situation.

1ki1568,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ki1568/explore_the_delonghi_magnifica_start_espresso/,Explore the De'Longhi Magnifica Start espresso machine review is it worth it,"The De'Longhi ECAM22080B Magnifica Start Fully Automatic Espresso Machine, Black, is more than just an appliance. It takes over your kitchen with its sleek design, promising to revolutionize your coffee rituals. Having used it daily for several weeks, there are plenty of highlights to share, as well as a few shortcomings that made me raise an eyebrow. This machine is an intriguing mix of sophistication and user-centric features aimed at beginners and coffee aficionados alike.

**Design That Steals the Show**

Right out of the box, this espresso machine impresses with its contemporary black plastic exterior finish. The compact size—at just 17” in depth, 9.25” wide, and 14” tall—slots effortlessly onto my kitchen counter. Its space-saving design is something I truly appreciate in my otherwise crowded space. However, the plastic finish does feel slightly less premium compared to steel competitors. The adjustable cup height feature is also a lifesaver, accommodating mugs and glasses of different sizes without making a mess.

**Ease of Use and Intuitive Interface**

The touchscreen interface on this machine makes operation seamless. It offers five one-touch options that cater to basic and advanced preferences, such as latte macchiato, cappuccino, espresso, coffee, and even hot water. My mornings are now simpler—just a few touches to brew a perfect espresso shot. The inclusion of adjustable strength and temperature settings has been a game-changer for customizing drinks.

**Highlights**

- Built-in 13-setting conical burr grinder ensures a fresh grind with superb aroma.  
- The LatteCrema™ Hot System effortlessly creates a dense, silky foam, whether you use dairy milk or alternatives like almond or oat milk.  
- Most parts, including the water tank and milk carafe, are removable and dishwasher-safe for effortless cleanup.

**The Coffee It Brews**

This machine delivers a spotless cup of coffee every time. Whether it's a cappuccino topped with a velvety froth or a strong espresso packed with crema, it excels in creating coffeehouse-quality drinks. Even my husband, who swore by his manual drip machine, couldn’t deny this espresso maker’s superiority. Still, there’s a slight learning curve if you're not familiar with grinding bean types or frothing milk.

**Weaknesses**

- Requires frequent refills due to a modest water tank size.  
- Beans need to be completely used up before swapping types in the grinder.  
- Can be slightly noisy during operation.  

**Functionality and Features**

The auto-clean functionality is an absolute win. After brewing lattes, I simply press the dedicated cleaning button to flush out any residue milk from the system. I’ve also noticed how well the grind settings work—the coarseness significantly affects the flavor, which is a bonus. My only gripe here is the absence of a bean-empty indicator, leading to a few accidental “water-only” cups early on.

**Competitive Options**

Comparatively, the Magnifica Start stands toe-to-toe with other super-automatic espresso machines in the market. For instance, Breville's Barista Pro has a steel build and a more premium look, but it also comes with a heftier price tag. Another alternative is the Philips 3200 Series, which features similar one-touch brewing but lacks the depth and quality of milk frothing seen here. Ultimately, the Magnifica Start balances functionality with affordability better than its peers.

**Value Proposition**

For its features, the product feels like excellent value for money. It grants the ease of a café-quality brew in less time than a morning commute. Even factoring in its minor flaws, it feels like an investment for daily use. A product in this price range with a conical burr grinder and the LatteCrema™ Hot System is a standout find in the sea of coffee machines.

How come I have low acid when omeprazole reduces acid and I feel better? I should feel worse if the low acid theory is correct right?

But be careful. Omeprazol reduces your iron and makes you sick. I survived almost a year without omeprazole being miserable every day but got my iron levels normal again.

It was so much pain...

To be honest, I think reflux has no cure at this point. But can be properly managed going for the lowest effective dose and tapering off, and coming back again time to time.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/qTOZIaO)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

Had endoscopic surgery about two weeks ago for severe carpal tunnel in my dominant hand. They used twilight sedation, which honestly was perfect. I woke up feeling like I had a great nap, not nauseas, not in pain (nerve blockers in my arm), went home and got another good nap.  Symptom relief was instant, no tingling or numbness in my fingers, no pain in my palm or wrist, I could wake up and still feel my arm. 

Swelling went down by the fourth day, but didn't completely go away until the seventh day, ice on and off helped a lot.  I had ibuprofen and Tylenol as my main pain medications, and she had given me 5 oxy, of which I needed 3 and only at night when I was an idiot and kept rolling on my arm in my sleep. I found out quickly that if I put a big body pillow and slept on my side with my arm propped on it I could sleep easy and comfy.  Showering was the worst bit, had to wash without my dominant hand and keep it dry, my wife had to help me with my hair a few times but it turned out fine. 

Took off work fully until today when the stitches were taken out, and she told me to limit my typing to 1-2 hours a day for another week or so, then go up as I feel comfortable. I write for a living and usually type up to 8 hours a day so this is the most frustrating part. There is still some pain in my wrist and bottom of my palm, but it's minimal and really only when I use it/try to lift anything bigger than a coffee mug. A gallon of milk is still an absolute no go. 

I won't need PT other than basic movements at home, and I'm on instructions to massage the scar and palm twice a day to help with scar tissue and the numbness. The scarring is super minimal, barely looks like a cat scratch. 

My next surgery on my right wrist is scheduled for next week with the same surgeon, very excited to get rid of the numbness, tingling and pain in that hand as well. I didn't get both done at the same time because I wasn't sure if I wanted to do the right just yet, but I began feeling more tingling when I woke up, so we decided it was best to just move forward.

1ki0uf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ki0uf0/testimony_of_coffee/,Testimony of coffee,"I’m so grateful to be able to stand and share my testimony today. 

My whole life I’ve suffered with digestive issues. Lucky for me they have been mild but I’ve basically gone through life nauseous and at different times I have visited doctors and done testing to try and figure it out.  Over the years doctors have tried different medications but also recommended exploring herbal remedies or coffee. I tried some herbal remedies but never coffee. 

…cue faith crisis (that’s another story)

But when I asked another doctor about it post faith crisis… the answer was actually very predictable. She was shocked that I didn’t drink coffee but was open to drinking it. She went on to explain so many benefits and convinced me to try it. I asked why she didn’t lead out with this information and she said if she recommended to Mormons to drink coffee, she’d be out of business in a flash. 

She explained the healthiest way to consume and gave me some guidelines on quantity. Told me to do it when I had access to a restroom for a few days because it may take a little time for my body to regulate. 

After a couple days, I felt better. I haven’t been nauseous since (3 years). I can’t even explain what it’s like to be sick for 2-3 decades and then feel completely better. It has changed me so much I probably can’t even list all the benefits. 

I share this experience In the name of Mormon Jesus. Amen

Now… this post has an ulterior motive. 

I have someone I love very much who has a chronic liver disease. I’ve done hours and hours of research on coffee and I believe coffee could really help her but she’s not interested in the studies. 

She may be interested in hearing others experience. I know she’s seen the benefits with my health but I have different issues than her. 

If you are willing to share experiences with coffee improving your health, I’d love to hear them. I understand health issues are extremely personal and I think even if you are a little vague or unspecific it could be helpful. 

Her doctor is LDS and when she asked him about it he gave an answer that was obviously practiced and tweaked over time and sounded like it was straight out of a testimony meeting.  Basically there was a lot of data supporting possible health benefits but you don’t need to consume to navigate this illness (duh). 

Over the last few years, I’ve read quite a few similar experiences on this thread from other people and I was hoping to be able to gather a few together…

I’m in the market for a new grinder (or possibly two), and could really use your input.

I currently have a Mazzer Super Jolly, but I’m no longer happy with it. It’s bulky, not great for frequent grind size switching, and has too much retention. I drink both espresso and filter (Moccamaster + pour over), so ideally I’m looking for a setup that supports both with ease and quality.

I’m torn between:

1.	⁠Mazzer Philos – looks promising as a good single-dosing grinder for both espresso and filter. Low retention, stepless adjustment, and very solid build. But: how well does it really handle switching between brew methods?
2.	⁠Two grinder setup:

•	⁠Fellow Ode Gen 2 for filter
•	⁠Profitec Twist SD54 or DF64 Gen 2 for espresso

This would let me dial each grinder in and leave them there. Simpler, a little bit less expensive and but a bit more counter space.

What would you recommend for someone who values:

•	⁠Excellent grind quality for both brew methods
•	⁠Low retention
•	⁠Ease of use when switching grind size (or not needing to)

PS: we drink mostly medium roast, full body coffee. Not many light roast.

Imagine a world where governments didn’t print money like it was going out of style. Imagine a world where you kept what you earned. Imagine a world where trust wasn’t stored in the suits of central bankers, but in math, code, and freedom.

Yep—*we could’ve had heaven on earth*.

But don’t despair just yet. While the fiat world’s been busy inflating away your savings and calling it “policy,” some of us have been quietly building. In the ashes of failed systems, one thing shines like a digital phoenix: **Bitcoin**. And right next to it, helping everyday humans tap into the future of money without breaking a sweat, is our handy little tool: [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

Grab a coffee, lean back, and let’s talk about how we *almost* had paradise—and how Bitcoin (plus a smart little QR code app) might still get us there.

# Chapter One: The Paradise That Never Was

Let’s rewind.

Humanity had everything. Infinite imagination. Technological genius. Enough food to feed the world. And the internet. We were *this* close to a decentralized utopia. But what did we do instead?

We created central banks.  
We allowed money printers to go **brrr**.  
We said, “Hey, let’s trust a few people in glass towers to run everything.”

Spoiler: They didn’t do a great job.

In a world where money is debt, and your savings melt like an ice cube in July, building “heaven on earth” is like trying to pitch a tent during a hurricane. We were lied to, taxed into oblivion, and gaslit into thinking 2% inflation was ""healthy.""

It wasn’t.

But something strange happened along the way...

# Enter Bitcoin: The Orange Pill of Hope

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto whispered into the void with a whitepaper and a vision:  
**A decentralized, peer-to-peer currency that couldn’t be printed, manipulated, or censored.**

Bitcoin was born. A mathematical protest. A lifeboat. An act of rebellion dressed as a protocol.

Suddenly, there was a glimmer of hope. Maybe we *could* still build our own slice of paradise—one block at a time. But here’s the thing: for Bitcoin to change the world, it had to be usable. Everyday people needed tools. Interfaces. Simplicity.

That's where we come in.

# Why QR Codes Are the Quiet Heroes of the Bitcoin Revolution

Let’s talk about friction.

You’ve got your Bitcoin wallet. You want someone to send you sats. But then you look at your wallet address. It’s 42 characters of upper-lower-number-soup that might as well be Klingon. One typo and your funds are gone to the void forever. Yikes.

Enter [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)—a free tool that turns your ugly, untrustworthy address into a clean, scannable QR code. No typos. No tears. Just scan and send.

Need a donation page?  
Selling merch at a crypto event?  
Accepting Bitcoin for your side hustle?

Use our QR code generator and instantly turn chaos into order. It’s like printing your own little piece of Bitcoin heaven—one square at a time.

# Heaven on Earth, But Make It Peer-to-Peer

Imagine this:

You’re a street artist. No bank. No POS system. Just your spray cans and a cardboard sign that reads “Tips in Bitcoin.” Next to it? A laminated QR code from [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

Tourists pass by. They scan. They send. You receive.

No fees. No middlemen. No red tape. Just peer-to-peer value exchange like Satoshi dreamed.

Or maybe you’re a café owner tired of paying 3% to the credit card cartel. So you set up a Bitcoin payment QR by the register. Customers scan, sip, and smile. Paradise.

It’s not hypothetical—it’s happening. Across the world, everyday people are using QR codes to bypass borders, banks, and bureaucracy. And guess what? It’s working.

# Bitcoin Is a Tool. QR Codes Are the On-Ramp.

Some folks say Bitcoin is too complicated. Too techy. Too far ahead. But the truth is, with the right tools, anyone can be part of the Bitcoin economy.

[**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](http://BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com) was built for exactly that reason—to make adoption dead simple. No logins. No fluff. Just input your address, add an amount if you want, and *poof*—you’ve got a shareable, printable, scannable payment link or image.

You can:

* Print it and frame it.
* Add it to your website.
* Put it on business cards.
* Stick it to your laptop like a badge of honor.

The future of money needs more than just miners and memes—it needs usability. That’s what we do.

# Okay But… Why Heaven on Earth?

Because that’s what Bitcoin represents. Not just money. Not just tech. But *freedom*. Real freedom.

* Freedom from devaluation.
* Freedom from censorship.
* Freedom to transact with anyone, anywhere, without asking permission.

Bitcoin puts power back in your hands. And tools like QR codes make that power accessible. A real monetary revolution doesn’t just need ideology—it needs action. It needs code. It needs things that work.

Imagine a future where:

* Farmers accept BTC for produce.
* Teachers get tipped in sats.
* Artists sell their work without middlemen.
* Donations go directly to causes without being frozen or delayed.

That's not sci-fi. That’s *heaven on earth*. And it starts with a QR code.

# The Final Word

Look, we messed up. Humanity had the ingredients for paradise and somehow cooked up economic chaos instead. But all is not lost.

Bitcoin is still here. Still running. Still uncensorable. And tools like [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) make it easier than ever to tap into the promise of a better financial system.

It might not be full-on heaven just yet. But every QR code printed, every sat sent peer-to-peer, and every merchant who says ""we accept Bitcoin"" moves us closer.

So go ahead—scan your way to freedom.  
Print that code. Accept that tip. Live that orange-pill life.

We could’ve had heaven. Maybe we still can.

Not that I haven’t tried, just unable to connect with others. Like today for example, my elderly neighbour was outside and started small talk. He mentioned a new guitar he has but doesn’t know how to play. That caught my attention because I’ve been playing for 20 years now. I offered to tune it, maybe show him some chords to get started. He says “maybe in the winter when I’m not busy”. I take that as we’re just neighbours, don’t want to be friends. This is a repeat with everyone I meet or try to get to know. People are simply not interested in me and I can’t understand why. I’ve had acquaintances and coworkers who would invite me for coffee, or a beer after work. But I just had the feeling they took pity on me, I was never part of the group. I used to see a psychiatrist. a few times she made me approach a complete stranger and try to begin a conversation. It was forced, but not unbearable. She never diagnosed me or said there’s anything wrong. So I don’t know, how do you find out if you have Aspergers?

1ki0bgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ki0bgi/cramps_too_muchtoo_fast_water/,Cramps - too much/too fast water???,"I can not just stop these leg cramps. 

Ive been taking 550mg magnesium supplement, then like 1/2 tsp lite salt in water + around a cup of spinach and an avocado every day...then Im also eating meats that have a decent amount of potassium like turkey.

 I think I do see its less likely to get them if using a lite salt/mio drink vs bodyarmor or this Keppi electrolyte drink mix I got. The Keppi stuff has made me skeptical how legit their stuff is, but Im no scientist so dont want to trash the brand. 

The one thing I read is maybe Im drinking too much water or too fast and flushing electrolytes. I have been urinating a TON. I drink around 70 oz of water plus like 2 - 3 cups of coffee in am. Sometimes unsweetened tea with dinner. My water consumption isually isnt just slow sipping. I will often not drink and then pound like 16 oz, repeat. 

I often wake up middle of night with severe leg cramps. Both thighs, hammys, and calfs, sometimes shins. Last 2 times I had sex, my leg cramped afterward. 1st time when attempting round 2 sex and last time just while we were lying there...and Id especially so anything not to cramp up while having sex or trying to just lay in bed naked with this out if my league, gorgeous woman. ANYTHING. 

Keto to lose weight for around 2 months. Down 30 Lbs. Its been really hard to eat more than like 1200 - 1400 calories, let alone hit protein targets too if that matters.

I have been trying to reach out to people I already know, to foster and grow friendships, with no promising results. I have also been putting a lot of work into my life to try and be 'more appealing' to others, but I seem to be struggling making a connection. I am possibly on the spectrum so it's more difficult for me. I tend to be blunt and call out things that do not make sense to me. It's nothing personal nor meant to be rude, but I do have high standards for those I let into my life.

I really only had one person in my life who 'got me' and she passed away before we could get married. The person I did end up marrying was someone I loved, but she fell out of love with me, probably a lot earlier in the marriage than I would have liked and I didn't have the fortitude to back out earlier when I should have. She also inadvertently helped me fine-tune my BS meter because she engaged (and still does) in inconsistent behavior, usually to my detriment as she would often neglect me.

I'm also tired of being the pursuer. I've always had to take that role in life and considering the amount of people who have purposefully left me, it would seem my choices for a possible partner or companion have not been the best. I did a lot of settling and I don't want to do that anymore. To be fair, I have had a few people pursue me but they also ended up lacking integrity and were VERY low on the honesty scale. Also, I'm picky and it can be difficult to get to know me. I'm starting to get to a point where I'm ready to give up on anything romantic. I might be happier that way but that would be future tense and it doesn't resolve my loneliness. It would be nice to have someone take a genuine interest in me and want to get to know me better. I know my worth, and it would be nice to have someone whose view of me matches my own self-view.

As much as people may be OK with talking online for a while, I often find these conversations lack actual substance and tend to slowly drift away. I'd prefer to not spend a LOT of time chatting online and actually schedule some offline time, someplace neutral and in public, so we can talk and have a conversation.

So now that I've laid out what sounds like a 'woe is me' story (it isn't, it's just facts), what am I looking for? An authentic and genuine connection, someone who gets me and vice/versa, and it doesn't feel like heavy labor to connect with each other. I'm more attracted to people who are artistic, intelligent, have integrity and understand what honesty really is.

I work in IT support, but my true love is music. I have a degree in piano performance and I am currently a part-time professional musician. I also am a talented singer and have been putting in a lot of work to improve. Another goal of mine is to get into voice-over acting. I feel I could make a living doing this and have been doing research on how to break into it as a career.

There's a lot to more to who I am, but let's start simple and see about meeting up for a conversation over a cup of coffee, drinks, someplace where it's not too loud with chaos. I prefer low-drama and low-pressure as I can get over-stimulated.

If this interests you, please send me a message. While I had to choose a tag, I am sex-positive, but I prefer to not let that be a part of the conversation right off the bat.

P.S. No men. I don't say this to be rude, but if I want a friendship that evolves into something more, I'm NOT looking for that in a man.",0,1746735956.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I threw a bag of shredded cheese into the freezer. I filled the coffee pot with water to fill the machine but I put the water filled pot back under instead. No coffee. Big sad. I left my keys in the front door. I put a jar of Nutella in the fridge.

I know the post is heavy on kitchen examples but right now I’m home way too much.

So has anyone else had brain fog issues or an increase of brain fog issues with methotrexate?

Whenever I've had shit thrown at me, I've been able to do what it takes to overcome it. This time though, things are outside of my control.

My mum, 3 weeks ago started displaying signs of capgras syndrome (as yet undiagnosed and untreated thanks to our shitty NHS) and thinks my father is an imposter after 49 years of marriage. 

She has started showing signs of cognitive decline but we're not sure if it's bipolar or signs of lewy body dementia, but her brain scan showed no signs of dementia. It's been horrible and very distressing for all my family, especially for my father. He had to call the police on Saturday as she became violent, for the first time in their marriage. 

Whilst there are people I can talk to, it's hard at night. Sometimes I just want to be held whilst the tears flow. I want someone to bring me cups of coffee and chocolate and stroke my hair. Just feeling all sad and pathetic. I'm doing what I can in the way of self care, and also for my parents, but I'm trying to emotionally catch up with the fact that my relationship with my mum will never be the same. It's heartbreaking. ",40,1746735813.0,LivingAlone,17,0.94,False

School isn't an easy time for anyone. Especially us. Everyone always seemed to have something going on. Me? It was constant.

And it wasn't fair to you.

Sure, I was a kid. But kids can be bad people too. Manipulative, two-faced, aggressive people. To some of you, I was your bully when I should have been your friend. I put you down to make myself feel better, to your face and behind your back. I made your therapists tell you to cut ties with me. I gave you insecurities that probably still last to this day. And still, in my world, you were the bad guy. It keeps me up at night sometimes, knowing you put trust and care in me only for me to squander it, and deeply hurt you in the process. I only hope you're doing better now.

To others, in a desperate attempt for attention and love, I burdened you with my traumas, and made my instability your obligation. I would test your loyalty in ways I didn't even realize, dangling suicide and self-harm over your heads, self-sabotaging and begging you to stay, making you feel like a babysitter who needed to keep me in check. It was never your responsibility. I was less of a friend and more of a patient. You deserved better.

I was opinionated, discrediting the experiences of people who told them to me in faith. You deserved acceptance. I was obnoxious, and caused scenes in public. You deserved someone more level-headed. I was apathetic in times you needed me, or chose sides without understanding. You deserved someone who listened.

I could apologize for a lifetime and it wouldn't be enough. I don't blame you if you hate me, I don't blame you if you'll never forgive me. In some cases, frankly I don't deserve it. I think about you almost daily, about good times, about bad, I find myself getting lost in what you could be like today. If we ever had a conversation over a coffee, how would it go?

I wonder if you think of me, too. If you ever think that maybe we'll cross paths again. We've grown up so much now, it's mind-blowing seeing some of you start careers and families. Feels like we were giggling in the back of English only weeks ago. I'm proud of you.

I hope you've all moved on okay. I hope I didn't hinder you too much. Please take care. <3",0,1746735806.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.5,False

However, we've had a new couple move in next door to us and I can hear the girl screaming every word. I have no clue what their names are but I know they are from VA, he's in love with some blonde girl (Miranda), and they have a dog that barks for 40+ minutes every single time they leave. She screams about how much she fucking hates him, and they often leave their windows out to our building courtyard wide open so their screaming echos through everyone's home if you have any of your doors or windows open. 

I haven't gone to my leasing management because I think I just lucked out on the worst possible neighbors from every side. Downstairs has subwoofers and when they play there music the mirrors on my walls shake and the glass in my coffee table rattles (we have their number tho and they are chill when we text them). We had a new set of neighbors move in above us and they're great too. The people before them never sat down and there was constant dropping of furniture and slapping of feet across the floor from 6:30pm every night to 12:30-1:00am. Since our leasing office is closed during those hours they always came to listen when no one was home and told us they don't see an issue with the people above...like no shit they aren't home! 

I've called the police 2x on my next door neighbors though. The first time she was screaming absolutely wasted running up and down the hallway at 2:30am  and begging her baby daddy not to leave her. Our building security refused to come out for a noise complaint and told me to call the police because when I called them they could hear the screaming from down the hallway. The next was last night after she answered the door saying, ""What they fuck do you want now"" ""leave it alone, get a life, I'm in a relationship that is going in circles, and Im pregnant"" then I told her I know cause I can hear it all and she called me a ""fat bitch"" to which I responded ""look at you"" this is when things took a turn and she lunged out her front door with a fist cocked up in the air. 

I did not engage further and she proceeded to film me and tell me I called her fat because she is pregnant. ""Fat"" never came out of my mouth and I have this whole incident on video. Once the police arrived they told me it was my fault because I ""popped off to her, and how would I react if it was the other way around"" ummmm idk I wouldn't be cocking my fist up in the air lunging toward a neighbor during my second face to face encounter. What do I do? Am I wrong!? I don't want to complain but I pay a lot of money and expect my neighbors to remain respectful.

It was empty.   It was always empty.   I thought back to when I was a kid and when I'd have to push aside the small golden tin ashtrays to the edge of the table and the place was always bustling, with styrofoam cups this time and with brown floors, and how old men in gray sweaters with holes in the sleeves and gray whiskers and WWII veteran caps would lounge about for hours, scraps of paper beside them and maybe a Bible, chatting with each other.  How mom would bring in two toddlers and a baby in a stroller and they'd get Happy Meals and the toddlers would race the cartoonish cars along the tabletops.  How it was a social place to be present.  Now, I sat alone for an hour, with my cup of coffee, sipping, reading, occasionally looking at the old man on his 6:30 am routine of mopping the now-pristine floors of the soulless postmodern remodel, how occasionally the door would open and close as someone would pop in to pick up a meal, how there was no longer any ring of a cash register, and no longer even a human being to take your order, just large glowing panels you'd silently watch and touch and touch and watch.

I’ve been procrastinating on/off so much the past couple months and this health issue completely came out of left field. I can’t drink coffee because of it (I’ve been using that to keep myself up and focused some days) and I’m assuming my meds are also off-limits since they’re similar in terms of category of drug/effect. 

I think the meds I’m taking for the discomfort are also making me drowsy? I can’t focus on anything. I only have about 5 days now to get 3 written assignments done and study for a final. And I have a feeling this issue won’t go away in that time…

My family used to make fun of me for drinking celery juice. My acne is now healed, for 3 years I haven't had a single pimple. They obviously see the results that following MM has brought me. Healed scalp psoriasis, nail psoriasis and cellulite. My psoriasis on my legs are still pretty bad, but it has gotten lighter and lighter and I trust the process very much.  My dad said ""Don't over do it with your celery everyday"" whilst drinking 3 or more cups of coffee daily . So I asked him ""How many cups of coffee do you drink daily?"" and he got the point and stopped mentioning anything about celery.

That said, I still have many things I need to heal. As I mentioned, my psoriasis is still pretty prominent. I also have rosacea too, however, I have a lot of faith in MM, I wish others would have it too. Especially my close family. It's hard feeling like you always have to fight to be heard.

Hopefully one day I can prove to them how useful this information really is. It's also great that a lot of things that Anthony has been saying are being proven now. No one knew about heavy metals a couple of years ago, and when I would mention it, people would straight up laugh at me. Now it's become more known and researched.
