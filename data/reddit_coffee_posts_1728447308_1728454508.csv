Working out has only aggravated my hirsutism, so you can imagine the frustration. I honestly wasn‚Äôt up for trying anymore.

I can‚Äôt even explain the joy of brewing that coffee, and I‚Äôm not one to deny myself life‚Äôs little pleasures. Excitement, and yes, a little shimmy, were in the building!

1fzkukt,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1fzkukt/im_wondering_to_pick_a_few_brains/,I'm wondering to pick a few brains.,"CPTSD question.

Sorry for lengthy post, trigger warnings about self harm and ending it. But Im curios about my self 

It's something I want to bring up with my therapist. But it's definitely effecting my married life and my wife may be bi-polar(or something like that, it's the shred of hope I have that I didn't marry a narcissist). But as some would know I'm definitely in rather vast states of emotions when I post, and tonight I feel depressed yes, but I feel the most like my old self in this moment and my inquisitive side is looking at questions. 

So around 17 years ago when deciding and working hard to be the me I wanted to be I thought and believed I had worked through everything. Giving it all slight ""Oh it was just verbal, and the physical from school and what not was kids being kids"" blah blah I realize now was horseshit hiding from my issues. 

But could CPTSD have been something, and maybe I'm reading to far into it... but I have since my first attempt essentially until my breakdown I'd have yearly crumpled on the floor crying from the build up. But very intense emotions to commit suicide, that I've always pushed through admonishing myself and the promise I made to my mom at 13 that have kept me fully safe to the point this last time I couldn't call my mom and called a friend who I essentially call daily to help keep me safe...which shows how good of a friend or really a brother he is.   My intestines have always been messed up, though in part I'm sure it was health. At 22 I wrecked my car and spent 21 to 25 drinking a 12 to 18 pack of beer nightly from 8-9 through 11pm go to sleep and work 12 to 14 hours. I cut way way back, to 1 to 3 at night to help sleep, and finally right now with marital problems I stopped cold turkey with no deep cravings, now two months almost... but I never worried about my drinking because after 25 I started getting hangovers and the first time it made work hard I stopped getting drunk. 

I've always had very poor opinions of myself, essentially turning to emotional abuse of myself. No physical self harm, unless you count getting frustrated while working which leads to a small work injury, like not thinking of safety first in summer heat and using a wire wheel on metal without wearing a sweatshirt as a sacrifice incase it pops back. Which led to cutting my stomach open, or when I almost broke my back. Anyway, having binge eating, addiction to energy drinks to function. Like 4 to six 20oz redbulls a day, two bottles dr.pepper, a thermos of coffee, and five hour energy, everyday while working but while also getting enough sleep. (I'm down to one a day now) 

I'm self susufficient but in my relationship I've come to rely on my wife, to help me emotionally and when she disconnected when our child was born and she started spiraling she essentially turned away and I spent about a year lying to myself that everything was fine until I finally broke and here I am. 


So I'm wondering could a lot of this all be related and it could be CPTSD? The straw that broke the camels back that really helped this was me and my wife's situation with the help of my MIL and her games of amusement. But I'm really wondering, and I will be talking to my therapist about this, hell I might just screenshot this post and blackout my reddit name and all other details but then I wouldn't have to figure out how to get this all out in an hour.",1,1728454148.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1fzkqy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fzkqy3/will_my_grinder_work_for_espresso_and_other/,Will my grinder work for espresso? and other questions [Baratza Forte BG],"I have recently bought a Baratza Forte BG, from my job for really cheap in hopes to it being the universal solution for espresso to pourovers. I am currently running a slightly more than moderately used Rancilio Silvia, with what I'm assuming is a 16g basket. As a current university student, I just recently had the time after moving to a new unit to set up my machine after summer break. I pulled 6 shots to try to dial in my grinder starting from A1 on the Forte BG, the most fine setting on the machine to Q2. Only from searching up recommendations online for grinding adjustments. All my measured 16g shots pulled in around 10-15 seconds with some being 16.5g of coffee in. I pulled one ""decent"" shot which didn't have much sour taste but that pulling on the higher end of 15 seconds and 16.5g of coffee in. My beans are also pretty old as they are from the end of summer break to 7 weeks into the semester. They were both roasted Aug 18th, to which is now Oct 9th. I know freshness is an important factor but not having bought new beans recently alludes to my concern. My questions being,

1. Is my grinder not grinding fine enough? (Multiple sources online have said yes and no to the Baratza Forte being able to reach espresso grind.)

2. Are my beans too old to produce viable results? (Aug 18th - Oct 9th)

3. Should I sell my Baratza Forte instead to purchase another grinder more capable of the higher and lower ends of grind size?

4. Should I purchase the grinder tools (burr remover/ adjustment screw) in attempt of making it slightly more fine? (30$)

5. Could my machine be damaged or operating incorrectly? (ie. channeling or incorrect pressure)

I also want to mention I deep cleaned the grinder using my store's grinder tablets and this grinder was bought for commercial use but was basically, unused. (Was shelved upstairs for over 2 years). I also did deep clean my espresso machine, using cafiza on all parts and cleaning the grouphead thoroughly. 

I've used the grinder for v60's throughout the time my espresso machine wasn't used and it provided great results on coarser settings.

The Silvia has given me great results before when I manually hand grind (torture) for all of my shots.

Any recommendations or thoughts will be greatly appreciated and if theres any specific questions that aid in figuring out my issue I will answer to my best ability.",1,1728453696.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I tried a lot of instant coffee types and finally found nescafe's ice roast to make decent iced cappuccino like coffee at home by putting the instant coffee in cold milk and adding ice. 

I was also drinking a lot of sleepy owl cold brews. I tried a lot of other cold brews from other brands. I got a 50pc offer from this sub on Blue Tokai cold brew. One of the sub members figured out how to generate codes. It was the worst money I spent on any type of coffee. The cold brew was horrible.

I am looking for homemade cappuccino that could resemble coffee from a coffee shop. I've watched tons of videos to understand what you really need to get espresso at home. I was eyeing the DeLonghi Dedica EC685 as I don't want to spend too much. 

I was reminded of this particular Murphy Richards
Cafe Rico Espresso machine that somebody had gifted about 12 years ago. I vaguely remembered that it gave watery coffee and that's why it was packed and put in a closet for the past so many years. To be honest, I didn't have the taste for coffee back then. 

Had I not been looking for cappuccino, this could be a perfect machine for drinking black coffee. 

I cleaned this machine and it seemed to work. I was quite impressed. I use the grind for drip coffee. And I got a drip style coffee. 

Do you think this machine would be capable of giving an espresso shot with crema? It does have a boilerplate for heating milk. And a normal frother. Somehow this machine seems like a glorified version of a drip coffee machine. And not an espresso machine. A proper espresso machine would have a steamer. 

Has anyone seen this machine online? What type of machine is this? How many bars of pressure can it create? I couldn't find a single manual for the product. It seems like it just has a boiler. Takes about 2 minutes for the coffee to come out. 

I don't understand using an espresso blend. Will it yield better results? Technically speaking it should. 

Can I justify buying the DeLonghi? I terrible reviews of their after sale service. Orient guys have no clue about the machine. The dedica is retailing for about 19k right now. ",1,1728452312.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

Hundreds of years before the start of the series, before the existence of a transnational communications system, when Kingdoms as we know them today were only starting to be established, Remnant was a more dangerous place for mankind in many ways. Back in the day, brute strength was required to survive, and many weaker men would be plucked out of the gene pool, allowing mankind to grow ever stronger and recently, more intelligent. 300 years before present, it wasn't unusual to see Huntsmen who were absolutely huge, up to 8 feet tall in many cases, and bearing such gigantic, carved muscles that many of them would make Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Jerry Lewis. Their bodies were adapted to build muscle mass very easily and maintain their inflated mass with minimal effort. These men quite literally resembled Greek Gods. Legends persist of how they would take down gargantuan (for the time) Grimm by themselves, and there are rumors that some would use their bare hands to dispatch them. Individual Huntsmen are remembered through public art, statues and frescoes, adorning the Kingdoms and smaller towns they singlehandedly protected in the infancy of these settlements, and the Huntsmen Academies of today often have dedicated monuments, and name their accolades as tribute to a few of the greatest heroes to inhabit their kingdoms.

Today, people of such might are much more scarce, thanks to Remnant becoming a more technologically advanced and overall safer place to live, which allows for the meek to survive and reproduce. More importantly, weapon technology has improved and the nature of aura has been better understood by the academies. Since getting a huntsman license in the modern age doesn't require you to reach such an enormous size and strength, this has allowed far more men, and a large number of women brave enough to take the challenge, to enroll themselves as defenders of mankind. However, this does come at a cost. Individual huntsmen and huntresses would probably be significantly weaker compared to the ones of bygone days, especially as new forms of Grimm appear, each new variety posing an escalating danger to mankind. This is why huntsmen are now commonly organised in teams in order to counter the threat. Today, you may occasionally find very tall men and women in Remnant, these individuals who are also very robustly built and muscular in addition to their heights, yes, even the women, are descendants of these mighty men who once guarded Humanity from extinction.



2. Fauna of Remnant



Compared to Earth, the environment of Remnant has been developed far less by human activity, thanks to the threat of Grimm. Therefore, there is a far greater degree of biodiversity in the more pristine landscapes of Remnant, and this means more animals, many of which are weirder than what you can imagine living on Earth today, such as horned Giraffe/Moose lookalikes, four tusked Elephants, Antelopes with trunks, Turtles with giant horns, polar Rhinoceros and Camel species, giant Ducks etc. somewhat reminiscent of Ice Age Earth. Because of this, mankind doesn't just have Grimm to watch out for when walking through the forest, they also have to be wary of whatever undiscovered predators might be lurking around. In addition, the wildlife doesn't have a great fear of mankind as you would see on Earth, as Humans haven't been able to pose any substantial threat to many of these species, therefore, a lot of them have a far more docile and tame behavior, especially if their habitats have no natural predators, such as in islands or isolated mountains.

I must mention, a lot of this does depend on how large the land area of Remnant is, as this would naturally give rise to a greater variety in animals.



3. High Society of Atlas

  
Atlas, the most technologically advanced city in Remnant, has developed it's own unique culture distinct from the rest of Remnant, thanks to it's bloody beginnings and modern affluence. Human colonization of Solitas was completed through 3 waves of migration, the first two barely survived the sub-zero temperatures and the lack of available food, but the hardened survivors were crucial to the success of the third wave in establishing the first permanent settlement, known as Mantle, their descendants still inhabit the historic old town on the floating city. Despite the first couple of decades being characterized by mass die-offs, the settlement quickly became the epicenter of pioneering technology and innovation while developing a very militaristic culture, seeking to colonize other parts of Remnant, all of these factors ensured that the kingdom emerged from the Great War as the world superpower. Coupled with the energy boom through mining dust and technology associated, the Atlesians have managed to make themselves incredibly wealthy, having built a near perfect, high trust society for themselves above the industrial sprawl of Mantle.

In contrast to their ancestors, the average Atlesian elite is rather slightly built, usually with not much in terms of muscle mass as they've eliminated the use for it. Most Atlesian men are very well educated, showcasing their great intellect (the most prized virtue in the modern kingdom) in their manner of speech, and they have a talent when it comes to charisma and friendliness. It's very easy for these young men to get themselves high paying jobs, even easier if your father owns the company you're trying to break into or runs a dust quarry, these jobs demand little in terms of labor and allow them to enjoy their free time at high-end restaurants, cocktail bars and parties with their co-workers. The women also have an easy time in life compared to those in other parts of Remnant, without the need to do menial work, they are allowed to pursue their creative hobbies, art, music, entertainment etc. and capitalize on them, groups of these socialites are a very common sight in the streets, department stores and cafes of the grand city and they also have a culture where they are expected to be exceedingly friendly, kind and generous to those around them. The wealthy, comfortable, stress-free lifestyle of young Atlesian elites has also made them rather eccentric, and somewhat child-like in their idealism, in contrast to the more pessimistic and jaded attitudes of some of the inhabitants in other parts of Remnant. They usually marry and start families young, which is easy when everybody in Atlas is a family friend of each other, and they tend to age very well, a mix of their natural beauty, healthy diets and care for their bodies, this is why you see a lot of girls travel to Atlas in search for some cute, rich boys. 

Atlas is not only the center of defense technology and finance, it also has a vibrant theatrical scene, producing popular and acclaimed musicals and launching the careers of aspiring stars worldwide. It's also well known for the grandiose architecture that comes out of the city, often considered the most beautiful in Remnant (with Mistral not far behind) along with the Atlesians themselves. And finally, since Atlas is a highly intellectual society, there is a vibrant philosophical movement in the city, residents would often flock to coffee houses and libraries to hear the debates between the great minds about human behavior, the best economic and social models to follow and more.

My JNSIL (DH‚Äôs only ((older)) sister) is engaged again. For the second time in 2 years. 

Extra long backstory, JNSIL was a friend of mine in collage and introduced me to DH. We were friends (she says ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù; I never thought of her like that) up until the minute me and DH got engaged (4 years ago). Through our entire engagement she was nasty, dramatic, and took every opportunity to make things about her. She was the embodiment of jealousy. Also during our engagement period my dad got diagnosed with cancer and passed shortly after. She did not send one message, say one sorry, make one single call through-out that 9 month period. My dad passed a week before her birthday and she made sure to insist that ‚Äúher brother‚Äù was there on her birthday (she lived 18 hours away) and the whole family (minus myself) flew out there for her 24th. The family dynamic is this: JNSIL does whatever she wants, says whatever she wants and gets whatever she wants and JNFIL and JNMIL enable and support her every move. JNSIL is also not quite right mentally; she‚Äôs 28 now, but her thinking, processing, and reactions are of a 10-11 year old. She‚Äôs very gullible and not very bright. She has little to no common sense of critical thinking skills and very little executive function. JNILS refuse to get her help or take her to a doctor. Complete denial. So one half of me empathises that she‚Äôs kind of a big kid, but the other half sees how intentionally manipulative, conniving, and hateful she is.

Come my wedding week, JNSIL FaceTimes a guy who tried to slide into my DMs the minute I got engaged to ‚Äúruffle feathers‚Äù, cry‚Äôs and insists on doing a first look with ‚Äúher brother‚Äù, gives me granny panties for a bachelorette gift because it‚Äôs ‚Äúher baby brother‚Äù, flirts and tried to get in bed with 2-3 of the groomsmen while drunk, divulges to the entire bridal party that she cheated on her long term bf with another guy and is now with him and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt feel sorry, because he deserved it! (He didn‚Äôt‚Äù), and pouts and makes a fuss when we talk about our honeymoon plans because ‚Äútravel is her thing!‚Äù. 

Fast forward to 5 months later, she‚Äôs now engaged to that BF, yes the one she cheated with. And low and behold she‚Äôs out of a job again (3rd time that year) and so is her stoner fianc√©, but they want to get married in only 8 weeks. And they live across the country with little to no support where there. And yet they demand everyone comes to them (18 hours) for a ‚Äúwedding‚Äù. And to add insult to injury they both were loosing housing (because they both got fired from their resort jobs that gave them the ability to live on resort). So yes, you got that right, a 26 year old and a 27 year old who have no jobs, no place to live, have only known each other for a year and who have completely different beliefs want to get married in 8 weeks, 18 hours from any friends or family. 

My JNILS, DH and I visited them 6 weeks from their wedding to figure things out. Both JNSIL and her fianc√© were spending money like it grew on trees, making no effort to actually plan the wedding, taking advantage of an elderly women by living in her basement and not paying her rent‚Ä¶ and fighting, every. single. second. They had absolutely nothing in common other than living like each day was literally their last, different religions, different tastes, different hobbies, different future goals‚Ä¶ little to no common ground. But it was all very passive aggressive considering, JNSIL was doing her best to abide by the new personality she had curated for this guy‚Ä¶


JNFIL and JNMIL have only wanted one thing for JNSIL, for her to be gone and married so they don‚Äôt have responsibility of her. So in response to all of this they say ‚Äúoh well! As long as she‚Äôs happy‚Äù. JNSIL has only wanted one thing her entire life ‚Äî to be married: for someone to assume responsibility of her life. She sees marriage as a benefit to her, and her alone. From the dozens of conversations I‚Äôve had with her she believes the minute you get married life is fulfilled ‚Äî she won‚Äôt have to work, she won‚Äôt have to ‚Äústay thin‚Äù, she‚Äôll be able to shop all day, she‚Äôll live in a mansion, she won‚Äôt have any duty or responsibility‚Ä¶ yeah. 


JNSIL has tried to marry almost every single guy she‚Äôs dated ‚Äî which has been about 10 ‚Äúvery serious‚Äù boyfriends. She meets them (normally when she‚Äôs already in a relationship), falls head over heals, absorbs them and becomes whatever they want in a women and centres her life completely around spending time with them and making them (and their families) love her. She‚Äôll change her personal style, hobbies, music taste, opinions, you name it, to mirror the man she is trying to lock down. Marriage is always brought up within 1-2 months of knowing this person, they date for 10 more months and it then ends in a fiery explosion, where of course, she is always the victim of a mean, mean man. Normally it‚Äôs just the result of her faux personality wearing off and the guy realising he has no idea who this person really is. 


So thus, the trio is dead set on getting her married and was content on ignoring the dozens of red flags in order to make. it. happen. 

I object! No really, I did. I told my husband I would not go to a wedding of two people who obviously would be divorced within the year, especially since it was over $3,500 (flights and stay) to attend this ‚Äúwedding‚Äù (which hadn‚Äôt been planned at all, but no one seemed to care about that). 

The whole family was in uproar, but my DH a stood his ground. We were guilted, shamed, yelled at, bribed, to go to this wedding for ‚Äúhis one and only sister‚Äù. But in the end (after 5 weeks of fighting) JNSIL was ‚Äúbrought home‚Äù by JNILS and after 2 more weeks ended her engagement (not her relationship, it still went on for another 2 months before she let him go). 

It was an awful time, I was still going through a lot of grief (a little over a year of loosing my dad) and I had my entire JNILS treating me terribly, for simple denying to attend an event.

After a few more months they finally ‚Äúadmitted‚Äù to my husband that *he* was right (he was the one who told them we  weren‚Äôt going to the wedding, and why), still to this day none of them have ever credited me for unintentionally saving her of that terrible marriage, but they tell him, often. 

She moved home, JNILS got her a job as a sales associate and bummed around for 6 months, constantly complaining and obsessing about getting married. She never really cared for her fianc√©, she just wanted that wedding, that freedom from adult responsibility. At 8 months her boss threatened that if she didn‚Äôt actually work they would fire her (the manager is such a bitch! - her words not mine). She was fired a year ago this week and has been unemployed since. 

After she was fired my husband and I (quite literally) begged her to come visit. She was depressed and we were concerned. After several ‚Äúreconciliation‚Äú attempts with JNSILS, we wanted to do what we could to bridge the gap that had been caused by her dreadful engagement. I know now that you can‚Äôt fix what you didn‚Äôt break‚Ä¶

She came, visited and graced us with her, entitled, ungrateful, lazy attitude. Did I mention she was illiterate? Yes, she cannot read because she ‚Äúhas dyslexia‚Äù, so she never has tried to learn, nor should she because everyone else must make accommodations for a 28 year old college ‚Äúeducated‚Äù white upper-class woman‚Ä¶ sorry this really grates me. She can learn Italian for a 2 month fling but she can‚Äôt read English, explain to me that. 

Anyways.. the visit was bad. We took her out to dinner, coffee, shopping. She turned her nose up to everything. She was just too refined and sophisticated for our city‚Ä¶ our 2,500 square foot home was ‚Äúso small, so cute DH!‚Äù.

What‚Äôs your goal JNSIL? A job? To move out from JNILS home? No! How dare you question her majesty! She has a blind date, and her only goal is to find a BF. Not a job, not an apartment, not real friends, or community. We asked these things very kindly and her response was literally the above. 


Fast forward a week, she meets this very boring, strange guy on that blind date. They have nothing in common, but not to worry JNSIL is on the case! New style, new hobbies, new music taste, everything tailor made for him.

Over the past year, since that visit, miss JNSIL has disappeared from our lives. She used to call every 2ish weeks just to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù, which actually wasn‚Äôt always awful, especially because she used to be my friend. They were surface level conversions, intentionally. But since last October she has only made one call ‚Äî to ask me to help her with something. She only texts and calls DH now and almost pretends as if I don‚Äôt exist. 

I have made 3 attempts to apologise (if our concern for her being a major entitled brat) came off wrong (it was sincere). I took her to coffee in August and told her I was sorry if I had been harsh with her considering her ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù. She said ‚ÄúI just want to be friend again, after last October, and taking to JNSILS I wanted to distance myself from you both.‚Äù Basically, ‚ÄúBecause you dared question why I was an unemployed, entitled, 28 year old brat living with my parents for free and spending their money on whatever I want, and dedicating my life to finding a husband, I decided it was best to distance you from ME.‚Äù Be so forreal. 

So here we are today: my JNSIL has been unemployed for a year ‚Äúfiguring things out!‚Äù, and has done literally nothing but attach herself to her boyfriend and become his ideal woman; poor guy. 

They began dating last December and wow would you look at that they are engaged! Today! Yes! That‚Äôs two engagements, (2 flings in between) in 2 years. She Facetimed DH while we were at the gym. He sent her to voicemail and said he was busy for the next hour or so‚Ä¶she didn‚Äôt call me. Which, I‚Äôm thinking back to the last engagement, she FaceTimed him (he sent her to voicemail lol)  and she FaceTimed me‚Ä¶ and considering she hasn‚Äôt answered my last text which was just a ‚ÄúWhat have you been up to?‚Äù And doesn‚Äôt call me literally for anything anymore ‚Äî she‚Äôll text or call my husband ‚Äútell your wife I said ___‚Äù. I believe that was intentional. Make it known to me that she is *so* happy, but I‚Äôll only hear that through DH. He can‚Äôt stand her.

DH called her back and there she was, the same as she was 2 years ago, grinning ear to ear as if she had actually accomplished something. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll have to plan a wedding!‚Äù She fussed, as if she doesn‚Äôt know, that we know, that she‚Äôs already planning to have their wedding at our wedding venue (yes, that is true) and requested to have the same ring as I (she told me that in person!). No, it‚Äôs not exactly the same, her‚Äôs looks like a knock-off.

I know, I should be relieved that she doesn‚Äôt call me or text me, or want me in her life. It just angers me that *she* thinks that she‚Äôs the victim, that *we*, that *I*, am the bad guy. She has only apologised to me once, and it was after I called her and explained to her for 2 hours that she had been acting inappropriately before my wedding. I should be the one to cut her off, I should be the one not calling her. 

If her or JNILS think I‚Äôm going to be jumping for joy at these nuptials, they‚Äôre all going to be very disappointed. 

If you‚Äôve read all of this, you‚Äôre a Saint. Any advice or explanation of my conflicting feelings is appreciated.

I‚Äôve been feeling pretty numb and emotionally drained. Yet I didn‚Äôt give in. 
All of this happened around my 3 week mark of sobriety. Today is 30 days which was my personal goal. Now I know if I got through all of the above without a drink, I can continue. In the past year I have inly been 2-3 days clean and a few 7-8 days scattered about.
 In a weird way, all of the chaos and shock helped me stay sober . I felt I needed to be present and capable for everyone involved which gave me purpose and motivation to continuing not drinking. I hope I don‚Äôt sound like a insensitive self absorbed person. It‚Äôs just that normally I would use any affliction to affirm my choice to cope with alcohol. 
No one really knows that I was struggling with drinking again and it feels weird to celebrate or spotlight myself amongst all the sadness. Plus I don‚Äôt really know how to celebrate without a beer so today I bought myself a coffee and a plant. I think I‚Äôll get a massage this weekend even.

I've just had a talk with someone who used to be my brother after 10 years of no contact. And my wife thinks I should give them another chance. I categorically said no.

I grew up with second child syndrome constantly being neglected by my parents or beaten.  By my late 20's I'd been disowned by my family about 3 times for daring to speak out about how I felt or the fact they were now ignoring my daughter.

During this 3rd time being disowned my wife coaxed me to give them another chance. I told her okay but when we have a child (the eldest girl isn't hers) and my parents neglect her I will not be saying anything about it. I will not be saying anything again. 
Fast forward a few years and we have a girl, it's now killing my wife they are neglecting her daughter. I told her I understand but I'm not doing this again.


My wife confronts my parents about what they have done to me over the years and my daughters. It gets so bad I have to go in and have a talk with my parents to explain to them how I felt growing up. I told them I don't blame them it just happened. Well they disowned me again.

3 months later I'm involved in a serious car crash. I suffer a brain injury,  PTSD,  right arm reattached and have severe depression. My parents come to see me, I tell them as far as I'm concerned I died that night and can we start again. This was in 2010.

For a few years I'm really bad and at a few stages I was close to being admitted to the mental ward. My wife is busy coping trying to hold everything together and begs my family for any type of support. I got absolutely none. My wife goes to them and breaks down again begging for help with me (I'm not doing anything bad, extremely suicidal).

Again I get no support, I phone my father and tell him we need to talk. I wanted to work this out, I needed him to be a father to me for the first time in his life. Just call out and take me for a walk 

Later that night about 11 a letter pops through the letterbox. From my parents, you guessed it. They disowned me, they had seen my medical reports, they knew I was suicidal. They knew my 7 year old daughter had taken to cuting herself because she couldn't cope with what had happened to her father and was seeing a counsellor. At this stage I now had 4 kids and couldn't work. 

The hurt and anger I felt was beyond anything I'd ever experienced. Slowly over the next few weeks my brothers and sisters walked away from me.

This was in 2014, I was seeing the brain injury team along with a psychologist, family counsellors and taking antidepressants. Along with a list of pain killers as I was in chronic pain with my arm.

Last year I happened to see my father out, I went over to his car and said to him. I will never understand how yous did what yous did but I forgive yous. I wish you no harm and wish you well but you will never be my father again. (I did this for him, I can't forgive them but at least they can have some peace).

Bar seeing my father that day,  nobody has come near me in 10 years. They have never tried to contact any of my children.  A few days ago my wife was in work and I accidentally put my phone on do not disturb. My wife phones  me constantly throughout the day as no matter what treatment I've received I still feel suicidal all the time. She couldn't get through and thought I had done something. 

I was awoken by the police, then the ambulance then in the midst of this the door knocks again. I open the door to my mother, I couldn't deal with this and said nope not today and closed the door.

Apparently my mother then sent me a text along with one of my brothers. I have long since changed my number. I know this because they contacted my eldest daughter. I did not want them coming near my door so I asked my daughter to get my brothers number. I wanted to tell him, I'm nothing to do with them anymore 

Today I was asleep when my brother called (I still need to sleep twice during the day).
My wife had brought him in against me saying under no circumstances are any of my family ever to be let into my house.

I did not ever want to speak to any of them ever again, I cannot and will not accept what they have done to me. I told him, I'm not your brother anymore and I will never be again. The anger in me was palpable, I have never gotten over this hurt. 

When he finally left he said your still my brother and asked for a hug. I told him to tell himself whatever he'd needs to so he can get through the day but don't go saying it to me. I said what was left of your brother after the crash you abandoned. He wanted to leave his number and I refused and told him never to come near my door again, him or any of his family.

I said if you see me out and want to wave or nod, I'll do likewise but do not try speaking to me. 

My wife who witnessed me go through all this tried to make me hug him, then tried to make me shake his hand, i refused. She wants me to give them another chance.

As I write this my head is messed up, I can't seem to explain to my wife. I had to let them go, I couldn't live the rest of my life waiting for them to finally do the right thing. Somewhere between 2014 and 2018 I moved on and accepted they weren't my family anymore. 

My wife's parents said to me at the time of the letter, it's okay you can be our son. Between her parents and her brothers and sisters they took me to all my medical appointments and there were tons. They put food on my table and clothes on my children's backs. They lent me thousands, they help me with my kids.

My neighbours called in every day to help me, see I was okay they still do.

I wish them no ill will but I cannot forgive them for abandoned me in that state. I can't believe my wife put me through that, she knows I no longer want them. She hated them for what they did to me and for abandoned her kids. 

However she wants me to forgive them for my mental state, she hopes it may help me somewhat just to be taken for a coffee or a walk.

I honestly can't, at the lowest point in my life my parents could have actually helped me for once. They walked away, I can't and won't ever give them another chance to hurt me again.

I know with my brain injury I don't always see things clearly, but I fail to see how I'm wrong in saying what I'm saying. I can't do it anymore, they left me, I get to decide if I want them back. And I don't.",2,1728450599.0,family,2,1.0,False

This fanfic follows the anime timeline I believe so it happens after  they destroy that giant ass ship in the anime.

Ah an oldy but a goldy just like I am Nagato this fanfic follows a more underrated Kansen in Azur lane. This fanfic will always hold a special place in my heart as I remember reading this to get through some boring classes in High school. Also was nice that the author interacted with his/her community and you can even see that in the beginning of the chapters if you check it out. Basically follows Portland through the pacific campaign but the plot kinda fly‚Äôs off the rails half way through. If you want a humor fic that is also serious this one is for you.

1fzjtyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fzjtyf/acne_quitting_caffeine_finally_cleared_up_my/,[Acne] Quitting caffeine FINALLY cleared up my face/body acne!!!,"I've had body acne for over 10 years but when I got off the pill 4 years ago my back acne and chest acne EXPLODED. I've tried everything: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, witch hazel, dandruff shampoo, salt water, alcohol, antibacterial soap, spearmint tea, no gluten, no dairy, no sugar... Nothing worked. I had angry cysts and little pustules all over my entire back and it has been so embarrassing.

Recently I read somewhere that caffeine can cause acne because it raises your stress hormones and that causes your skin to produce way more oil, leading to breakouts. I drank caffeine every single day, so I decided to try it out. It's been about 1 month of only ONE half-caffeine black coffee per week (as a treat on the weekend) and herbal teas every day as a substitute and omfg.

**My back is almost 100% clear for the first time in years.**¬†I just need to heal some scabs and dark spots, but I have no active acne. I think if I were to cut caffeine out completely it might be even better but I'm going to see if I can get clear with one caffeinated drink per week because I really love coffee. Also, I tried switching to decaf (which has a little caffeine) and green tea, but my bacne did not improve. It has to be 100% caffeine-free for me.

As a bonus, my facial skin is way less oily, and the breakouts around my jaw went away. I don't get jittery/anxious anymore either.

I just needed to share this because this is the only thing that has ever worked for me. I haven't changed anything else and the difference is DRAMATIC. I will take a photo of my back and post an update if people want to see. I don't know if I have a photo of it before but I will look.

PLEASE try it for a month 100% caffeine-free if you're struggling with persistent face/body acne!!! It took about 2 weeks for a noticeable difference in inflammation and a decrease in new breakouts.

1fzjr3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fzjr3k/aita_for_being_upsethurt_that_my_bf_27m_continues/,AITA for being upset/hurt that my bf (27M) continues to hang out with his ex (26F) and not tell me? ,"My boyfriend spends the summers back home with his family. This past summer his ex reached back out to him after 6 years of no contact. She had blocked my bf after she got into a relationship with a shitty guy who told her to.

Anyway, she reconnects with him via text saying that she just got out of a shitty relationship and she's sorry for blocking him and not talking to him for 6 yrs. She goes on to suggest that they should catch up and hang out sometime. He accepts her apology, agrees, and doesn't think anything of it (other than ""wow her ex sucks"").

They end up meeting for coffee and my bf's sister (26F) joins them. According to my bf, it was ""really weird"" to see her for so long and it seemed like ""she hadn't changed at all"" in the 6 years they didn't speak. He said that she spent almost the entire time talking about the ins and outs of her shitty relationship she just got out of (getting into very explicit detail about their sex problems). My bf's sister also said there was a weird vibe and felt uncomfortable being there.

He tells me about everything I've said thus far after it's already happened. Which is out of character for him since he tells me almost every time he goes somewhere (not bc l demand that of him, I don't and never will). I let him know that the hangout definitely seemed odd, how she just word vomitted such intimate stuff after not speaking for 6 years, to which he agreed.

I asked him if he thought that she still had feelings for him, as it's interesting that her ex was one of the first people she reached out to after the breakup. He said that he didn't find it too odd because apparently they had been friends before he got blocked. I said something along the lines of ""ok fair enough. still rubs me the wrong way though"". Then I asked if she still texts him or wanted to hang out again. He said that they were still texting, but he ""thought it would be weird"" if they hung out again. The way he was talking made it seem like he was uninterested in meeting up with her again.

However, he ends up telling me in passing that he left his favorite sweatshirt at his ex's house. I was confused by this because the last time I was aware they hung out was at the coffee shop, not at her place. I said that to him and he said ""oooh yeah I did end up hanging out with her again, it was weird"" then shifted the conversation to how much he was dreading going back there to pick up his sweatshirt. He said that he was going to ask his sister to go by and pick it up so he didn't have to and that was the end of it.

Again I'm thinking to myself, SURELY he's not going to hang out with her again because he keeps saying how ""weird"" she is and how ""she's still stuck in the past"", implying that being around her is awkward and uncomfy.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I come to his hometown to visit him (he's recovering from surgery). Me, him, and his sister are in the car and he gets a text from his ex. His sister exclaims ""omg! is that [ex's namel, what is she saying??"". He says that she just sent him an old picture of them together as a couple. His sister says ""that's weird, she didn't type anything?"", my bf says no. Then his sister goes on to say ""wait [my name], what did you think about the last time they hung out?"". I share the brief into my bf told me last time, saying that it was unfortunate he had to go back at some point to grab his sweatshirt.

She looks at my bf and then at me through the rear mirror, then says ""[bf name] you didn't tell her about the last time you hung out with [ex's name]?"". He gets all quiet and says something like ""oh no i didn't think to mention it"". His sister then told me about how he went over (again @) to his ex's house alone to hang out. This time, it was at night and she answered the door clearly drunk. She spent the entire evening airplaying old photos of the two of them as a couple and more recent selfies of her on the TV in the dark. She continued to drink the duration of his stay (he's sober btw, which she knows). Then she says to him ""I'm really sorry about the way things ended between us. I keep thinking about it and you really deserve another chance"". He claims that he shut her down after she said that and said that he just wants to be friends and nothing more. He then stayed for a while longer before leaving.

Again, this is all coming from his sister. I honestly don't know if he would've told me any of this had his sister not happened to bring it up. He's one of the most transparent people I know, one of the reasons I love him so much. So it was super odd that he didn't tell me about this - especially when she admitted to repeatedly thinking about getting back together and then essentially proposed the idea to him.

I'm asking if you think that ITA here for feeling so hurt by the lack of transparency and bc he keeps choosing to hang out with her, despite allegedly feeling ""weird"" about it? Am I being too sensitive or is this hurt valid? Please let me know any and all thoughts !!! I feel so conflicted and am too embarrassed to ask friends/fam about it. Also, I do plan on having a conversation with him about it soon! ",4,1728449600.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

My medical tests showed nothing wrong. My husband had a sperm count just slightly below normal, but the doctors said it shouldn't stop us from conceiving.

My ex came back to spend some time with his parents. I ran into him one day while my husband was away on business, and we had some coffee, then we drove around town together. Before I knew it, we were out in his parent's guest house going at it like rabbits, no condom, no nothing. This was the day I was supposed to be sure and have sex with my husband according to all our fertility monitors and charts, but he was snowed in at an airport and didn't make it back home till days later. I can't pretend I didn't think about the possibility that I'd conceive by my ex boyfriend while we were having sex.

1fzjpmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1fzjpmy/anyone_have_experience_using_a_regular_job_in/,"Anyone have experience using a regular job in lieu of an internship, for a required college credit..?","TLDR, I'm getting a second Bachelor's in Accounting, and my program requires a ""Professional Experience"" course towards the end, which is definitely *intended* to be an internship. The course description, however, *does* read as ""employment, internship, or comparable experience"". 

Traditional internships (like, those structured, ""come in and work for 10 weeks"" experiences seem like they take a very long time to line up unless you're great at networking, which I am not. I'm seeing postings now, (in October), for programs in Summer and Winter 2025.

Frankly, tho, at 36 years old, and quickly running out of energy to continue being in school, the immediacy of, like, seeking a regular job (who are probably looking to hire either immediately, or in the next couple of months) is appealing to me, tho it's unclear if the University will accept it for the Professional Experience course.   I'd really, **really** like to complete this requirement in Spring 2025.

""You waited until the semester right beforehand, to start looking?""

No - I actually work at a place full-time now (job title was ""Accounting Intern""), and the plan was to just use this experience, for the course. Inconveniently, I've only JUST become eligible to register for the actual course, but I am **10,000% certain** I will not survive another busy season, if I remain at this firm during the spring.  THIS year (my third) was me thugging it out, to see if my ability to handle tax season would improve. It ... ... hasn't. 

  
""Ask your department.""

I have..! Basically asked ""if I wanted to use regular employment for this course requirement, what should I be looking for, really?"", and the response was kinda just ""well, it's not unheard of. We'll cross that bridge when we get there"". Very vague.

The only real requirement for the Internship you submit is that ""The amount of clerical/administrative work should be limited to 10% of the amount of time in the experience."", but I'm not sure what ... *counts* as that, as silly as that may sound. I mean, it's obvious they don't want you, like, answering phones and getting people coffee like in a 90s movie, but doing a small restaurants bookkeeping / bank recs / sales tax, for instance, feels kinda clerical. 

**""Bruh what are you asking us""**

**If anyone has used regular employment to fulfill a colleges Internship requirement, in order to attain your degree, what was your experience doing so?** What job did you use? What was the timing like? Did the school give you a hard time that it wasn't a regular internship? What is the ""evaluation"" part like, that the employer provides to the school? How do you tactfully bring up, in an Interview, ""oh btw I know this is a regular ass job, but I'm also using this as part of a class requirement, so if a manager could fill out this performance survey thingy down the line, I'd really appreciate that""? 

Sorry if this is the wrong place to be asking such a thing, and for the length.

You broke so many promises/maybe those were flyby words?? You said you would call on the way to the airport. My phone never rang. 
We‚Äôd go dancing. That time never came. Coffee‚Ä¶ not a chance.

I have wrapped myself up in a warm blanket of satisfactory acknowledgements. Crumbs of what I know you are capable of. But, you owe me nothing! Never have. You were just a nice guy.

I feel so foolish trying to make you jealous that night. I made things weird, but I am glad I did.

We became best friends and I eventually fell in love with her. We started talking constantly. Texting and FaceTime about work and then some. We go out to dinner, coffee, all in the excuse of ‚Äúfinishing work‚Äù. She sometimes sleeps at my house just to hang out. Cuddling, I kiss her on the cheeks sometimes. I kept flirting with her and was dropping bombs here and there. I was spitting game. Eventually, I mustered up the courage to confess my feelings. She was so shocked, confused and in disbelief because she thought she wasn‚Äôt my type and figured she was ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. And then she dropped the ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend‚Äù. I was heartbroken because i honestly didn‚Äôt know. The office didn‚Äôt, it wasn‚Äôt known, there were no signs, and I ASKED HER!! She said they were long-term, on-and-off, and haven‚Äôt been talking for awhile but recently the dude‚Äôs been coming back. Anyway, I apologized so hard and fucked off because I didn‚Äôt want to become a cheater. I know I‚Äôm a piece of shit but I haven‚Äôt crossed that line yet. Plus I got cheated on my last relationship. So I‚Äôm wondering how tf am I attracting the same women? 

They eventually broke up and I came back to her life to pick things up where we left off. We‚Äôve been in a relationship ever since. We‚Äôre living together now.  She‚Äôs a genuinely good person, takes care of people, she just made a mistake. One problem is I just don‚Äôt trust her. I keep thinking ‚Äúif she did it to him, she can do it to me‚Äù. I know what I did was bad. If she does cheat on me, I know I deserve it, and it‚Äôs karma. But how do I get these thoughts out of my head? I love her deeply and want to marry her.

The only downside is that at some point, some knucklehead covered it in blue paint.

The good news is that the paint is just a thin little layer - it is already peeling off and I can chip away at it with a fingernail. What's the best way to go about getting it off in one go? I don't want to harm or tarnish the material underneath. I am not sure whether it is brass or some other metal.

Is it wise to do this before seeing a sleep doctor and getting a sleep study? I won't be able to compare the before and after results.

I also sometimes just get too energized before bedtime sometimes despite being also tired. For many years I was sleeping during the day and awake at night so I think it permanently prevented me from having a normal sleep schedule which I HAVE to get back to for work. I think ultimately I'll need to be on some kind of sleep medicine like Lunesta to get me to sleep and to stay asleep but then I'm worried about my bladder bursting if I drink too much water right before bed. But then I'm worried about those drugs and feeling tired when I wake up from their side effects despite getting a full sleep.

Sometimes I'll have just a small coffee during the day but I feel like even just that will last all the way to night and keep me awake sometimes but if I don't drink it then I won't have enough energy throughout the day on days where I didn't get good sleep.

Can be something totally optional too as long as you can repeat it throughout the whole game. It can be essential to the game, it can be something that only \*you\* find to be a crucial component to the ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù game experience/full enjoyment/immersion in the game. I was recently thinking bout this and these couple stand out in my gaming life the most right now

* Cooking food/brewing coffee after hunting/ washing, dressing up, going to town in RDR2 ‚Äî I was really happy to see that the RDR2 community - at least on the main sub - heavily appreciates this aspect of the game. Just chilling, fishing, hunting, doing mundane stuff and breathing in the whole Wild West spirit, actually feeling you‚Äôre in the world. Like 80% of the game is actually cozy imho
* Turn of the Seasons in Stardew ‚Äî It‚Äôs a loved game so I‚Äôm not gonna go deep into it but the seasons changing is not only so important for the gameplay, but it combines with the atmosphere to really make it feel like the full cozy farming experience with each season having its own flair and events and stuff to do, and resources to gather etc.
* Paper folding puzzling in Paper Trail ‚Äî Also a core mechanic since it‚Äôs basically how your play the game, folding and refolding the UI to progress, find NPCs, and solving puzzles. Weirdly one of the most satisfying mechanic + vibe combos, and in such a simple game. Goes great with the story its trying to tell too, with a minimalistic kind of charm to it
* Lighting the bonfires in Dark Souls ‚Äî Decidedly a \*non-cozy\* series all in all, but just the way the music changes, the way the bones crackle when you light them and the way you can feel your sad knight resting is just such a cozy moment that it sticks out to me every time I get back to these games (DS1 in particular)

I know half of these are not from cozy games per se, but I think that‚Äôs part of the reason why they stood out so much as these bastions of comfort in otherwise (DS leagues above the others) stress inducing games.",6,1728448047.0,cozygames,1,1.0,False

The woman drunkly confessed her feelings to Fiona, and they admitted that they ghost the other woman. Then, I told Fiona they can come to some sapphic bars with my friend and I. Fiona basically declined, and they said they‚Äôve slept with so many woman, so they‚Äôll run into one of their flings. Fiona said they‚Äôve ghosted some of the woman, and it would be awkward because they‚Äôre scared these other women will confront Fiona at the bars. I thought this was a little weird because we live in a pretty big queer city. So, this is situation. Fiona see this as more casual, but I really like them. Am I overthinking things? Should I also see other people? Any advice is helpful. Please be kind. ",2,1728447567.0,LesbianActually,3,0.75,False
1fzj7q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fzj7q1/not_sure_how_to_handle_my_lunches_anymore/,Not sure how to handle my lunches anymore.,"TW/CW: potential ED, dysmorphia, lots of food talk, puking, nausea

I didn't know where else to go for this besides a dietician or psychiatrist, but I am a very broke 21-year-old. Who can afford that right now? Definitely not this guy. Not really searching for a professional opinion at the moment anyway. I'm curious if anyone else has dealt with something similar and how they've dealt with it.

I've struggled with my body image for as long as I can remember. I could spill the beans on where I think the insecurity stems from, but that's not really why I'm here. To be honest, I'm not even sure my insecurity is what's driving my current issue. At least, not consciously.

For the past several months, I have had the WORST time puzzling out my meals. It wasn't the biggest issue when I was living with my parents because they always had enough food for me to play around with. Don't get me wrong, I still struggled with my meal planning. I tried food prep, thinking it was an issue with my executive functioning. It could very well be, even now. But, eventually, I stopped prepping. The repetition of taste and texture ended up being my downfall, which I found odd considering I've always been a fan of routine. It was around this time I began questioning if I was on the spectrum.

My next solution was to buy pre-made or frozen meals and alternate between them. And then the pre-packaged stuff got boring, and then the frozen stuff made me nauseous just to think about. Ever since, strong, flavorful smells have started to make me queasy. My best friend (who eats lunch with me at work) often eats pizza hot pockets. The garlic pastry, when it's warmed up, SHOULD smell amazing, but instead, it makes me clutch my stomach and want to find the nearest trash can or bathroom to retch in.

That brings me to my most recent solution: meal replacement shakes. The ones I purchased have an... interesting smell. My best friend says it smells like coffee, but it smells to me‚Äîin the least graphic way I can manage‚Äîlike when my cat uses her litterbox. And, oddly, it doesn't deter me. I've been drinking these shakes for my lunches (with some other small snacks) for almost a week now. It would work perfectly fine, but of course, I can't seem to catch a break.

My hunger will be sated for the promised 4 hours it says on the bottle. But, almost like clockwork, as soon as those 4 hours are up, my stomach starts bubbling and churning, and I have to race to the restroom. I suspect this has something to do with the dairy content of the shakes, as I am sensitive to lactose. Obviously, the smart thing to do would be to stop drinking them. But then I am quite literally left to starve for most of my day. I eat a small frozen breakfast sandwich in the mornings, or sometimes a mini bagel with cream cheese. And I'll eat whatever my sister-in-law makes for dinner if there's any left by the time I get home. Otherwise, I'll heat up some top ramen and call it a night. I've never had an issue with those. Lunch just seems to evade me. I could try simply skipping lunch and relying on snacks, but knowing me, I'll fall back on some really unhealthy choices. Not to mention, once again, I am very broke. Snacking is not exactly the best way for me to navigate our messy economy at the moment.

Anyways... any general advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Additional Notes:
- I am not diagnosed with ASD, nor any EDs. I only speculate based on what I know and how I feel. I am uncomfortable self-diagnosing myself with any real confidence. I don't mind, however, other people speculating about me, especially to offer insight or perspective I may have overlooked and may need to look into.
- I am AFAB. Feels like important info when it comes to mental/emotional things, given the lack of research done for AFAB people.",1,1728447547.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

About me: 
- 28 years old
- 6 ft tall
- halfie üá∫üá∏ üáµüá≠ 
- average-to-fit body type (SFW/wholesome pics on my profile!)
- big fan of good coffee shops, fantasy books, live music, and silly questions like this

Anyway! I know that consensus is that performance generally matters more than size. But when people do talk about size, it seems like they're usually asking about length. Despite that, I have also heard people say that the girth is important, too!  

So I'm just wondering if there is any agreement on this. In your opinion, which is more important in bed? Is length better than girth, or does girth matter more than length? And why?  

I think it would be interesting to learn what different people think about this! So if you want to share your opinion, feel free to message on here :)

1fzj5ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fzj5ig/how_do_i_trust_my_girlfriend/,How do I trust my girlfriend ,"I met my GF last year and we started as co-workers. We‚Äôre on our late 20s. I‚Äôm a total introvert, quiet, tatted, and I look like I bullied you in high school. She‚Äôs the opposite. People gravitates towards her and they tend to love her. She‚Äôs also attractive. Everything was innocent. She was my supervisor so immediately I hated her. I just go in everyday and do my work. I keep to myself, I don‚Äôt talk to anyone I don‚Äôt give a fuck about, finish my work, and then I fuck off. Since I was directly under her supervision, we started spending a lot of time together. We talked online about work and then some. Constantly texting and Facetime. Naturally, I fell for her. My last relationship was pre-pandemic and I got cheated on so my morale was low. I was a vegetable at that point and was desperate for some motion. Maybe it was the lack of self-respect and desperation that made me think I can get her. (I was really batting out of my league here, guys. She was hot)

It became two months of constant communication, in and out of work. We would go to dinner, coffee - all in the excuse of ‚Äúfinishing work‚Äù. Sometimes, sleepovers. I had a good sense that she was maybe falling for me as well. I was flirting with her HEAVY. I was dropping bombs here and there. I was spitting game. Also, the office was starting to talk. The sexual tension was palpable. For some work event, we‚Äôre at a resort just chilling at our room alone. She said she was cold so, naturally, I cuddled her for some body heat. Self-preservation. This wasn‚Äôt the first time I cuddled with her so I knew she would respond well. We were horizontal in bed talking so I gathered the courage and just confessed my feelings. She was shocked, confused, and in disbelief because she assumed I only saw her as a best friend. She also thought i had a different ‚Äútype‚Äù so she figured she was ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. And then, she dropped the biggest surprise of all. She has a boyfriend. I was shocked. I honestly didn‚Äôt know. There were no signs, it wasn‚Äôt known, and she hid it from everyone. Also, I ASKED HER, she said she didn‚Äôt have one (I asked her few months ago, she said they were broken up that time). 

She was in a long-term relationship, no talks of marriage, on-and-off, and they weren‚Äôt speaking for months already. But recently they were. The guy was starting to come back. Dude was even updated on her current location and who she‚Äôs with -including me. They‚Äôve talked about me, saw our photos and decided I was not a threat (which is dumb because I look like an asshole). I was heartbroken, angry, and just shocked. Because WHY do I keep attracting women who cheat? It‚Äôs the 2nd time in a row now. Anyway, the night went on. We continued talking to figure things out. I apologized for all the things I did. I admit all the hopes of sex were gone. I didn‚Äôt even make a move because I didn‚Äôt want her to cross that line. I didn‚Äôt want to become a cheater. We fell asleep together, still cuddling. We went on the next day and separated ways. 

I told her that I would back off completely. I apologized many times and told her I didn‚Äôt want to be part of her mess.  She said she was going to figure things out and assured me that we could still be friends. But I was honestly so deep in love with her already that I didn‚Äôt stop want to stop talking to her. Nothing flirty, just work and casual conversations only. 

Things went pretty fast. It only took a month for them to figure their shit out. I guess they were really on the brink of death. They broke up and the guy got back up pretty quick with his new girl. What‚Äôs crazy was they never blamed me for what I did. They said I didn‚Äôt cause the breakup, I was just the catalyst. I came back to her life and picked up where we left off. Things went smoothly and we‚Äôre  official in just a month. We were really compatible on all areas. She even told her dad I was her soulmate. Honeymoon stage? Of course, it is. 

We‚Äôve been in a relationship for almost a year now. We‚Äôre already living in together. It‚Äôs been going great. My only problem is I don‚Äôt fully trust her. I always think to myself ‚Äúif she did it to him, she can do it to me‚Äù. Granted she came from an absent boyfriend but it doesn‚Äôt change the mistake that we did. Although, she‚Äôs proven her loyalty to me anytime some guy comes sniffing her way. There‚Äôs always some guy who wants her. I always wonder if I let off the gas a little bit that she might go looking for it somewhere. But hey you can‚Äôt drive a Lamborghini and be mad that people want to look at it, right? You‚Äôre the one who decided to drive a Lamborghini. 

I know what I did was wrong and if she decides to cheat on me, I know it‚Äôs karma and I deserve it. I firmly believe that my girl is a good person. She just made a mistake. She takes care of people while I‚Äôm a dirtbag who only looks out for himself. 

BUT I JUST CAN‚ÄôT TRUST HER.  
I‚Äôm sorry for the long story. I really need advice.",1,1728447320.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
