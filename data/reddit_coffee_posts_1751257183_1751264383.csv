1lo0at7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/1lo0at7/returning_to_sf_in_august/,Returning to SF in August!,"**Hey everyone!**  
Thanks so much for helping me out with my first trip to San Francisco back in May—and a special shoutout to the awesome Redditor who gave me an incredible tour of his office!

I’ll be back in SF this August for a career event, and while I’m there, I’d love to attend any tech events happening in the Bay Area around mid-August. If you know of any conferences, meetups, or gatherings that could help me grow or improve my chances of landing a job (I’m still a student with one year left in my degree), please feel free to share!

I truly appreciated all the amazing suggestions last time—the kid inside me was beyond thrilled to see his SF dream come true.

As the saying goes, *“Everyone is worth a cup of coffee.”* So, if anyone’s free around that time and open to sharing their experiences and tips over a coffee—whether it’s about the tech world, job hunting, or life in the Bay—I’d genuinely love that.

Thank you again. You all are amazing! 🙌✨",1,1751264294.0,AskSF,0,1.0,False
1lo0aku,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lo0aku,Ive done it!.. 3 months progress report 29M,"I randomly got my bloodwork done on 31st march '25 and got these lipid profile results. I got scared and started panicking.. and started calling doctors online consultations or whatnot.. because i was smoking i was panicking even more for some reason. There was a pizza slice in my hand. From that moment i decided that this will not do. After a few days i found r/cholestrol on reddit which calmed me down a little. People here are really helpful and i thank this /r for my success as well.
Mostly it was diet.. from day 1 i quit smoking and its been 3 months now since ive touched any sort of smoking material. Berry smoothies everyday. 5km walk everyday, joined the gym after 20days of following this routine never eating outside switched from refined sunflower oil to mustard oil and ghee and sesame seed oil. Kept switching these 2 every month. Avacado smoothies, bluerry smoothies and overnight oats. Everymorming fenugreek water/fennel water and overnight soaked almonds and walnuts. Never ate anything from outside onoy home food. Whole wheat only/ brown rice only. 2 litres of water or more water (tried). Even took home cooked food so i dont have to eat outside.

1lo090y,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1lo090y/did_40_initially_cause_anxiety_for_anyone/,Did 40 initially cause anxiety for anyone?,"Hey 👋🏻 
I’ve gone from 20mg first month, 30 mg second month and am on 40mg now. 
This is my 6th day on 40mg and the last 2 days I’ve been way more anxious than usual. On 30mg I found I had a nice quiet brain, but yeah the last two days I’ve felt quite anxious and odd. I did have coffees closer together than normal so that could be causing the anxiety now that I’m on 40mg… 

I found that after a couple of weeks on the 20 and then 30 I “got used” to them. Do you need a bit more time to get used to 40 as well? 

Tomorrow I will alter my day and I definitely will not be having a second coffee and will see if that helps!! 

Anyone else taken a couple weeks to get used to 40? Or did you find 40 a bit much and to back to 30s?

It was about making everyday life better even if most chains haven’t figured out how to get there.

But @avax is different.



It’s quietly becoming The Adoption Network and here’s what that actually looks like 🧵

2/ Let’s talk about the Avalanche Card.

Yes, an actual card.

3/ Then, FIFA chose Avalanche for a reason.

FIFA+ Collect brought NFT collectibles to fans across the world not just “degens,” but actual football fans.

W/ FIFA L1, Avax is helping ticketing, collectibles, & fan engagement go onchain at global scale.

1lo06jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1lo06jp/daddys_girl/,Daddy's Girl,"You take care of your father and be a good girl, Melody,” my mother said as she stood in the doorway of our house, her the tight, gold necklace glinting about her throat. She always wore it. The thin chain kept the heart-shaped locket pressed to the hollow of her throat. Her braid of brown hair fell off her right shoulder and down the front of her conservative dress. My mom always wore the most conservative dress. She was such a fifties housewife, staying at home, keeping everything clean, being subservient to [dad.Like](http://dad.Like) always subservient. She would fetch him beers when he watched TV after work and always made sure his coffee was topped off during breakfast. Every day when he came home from work, Mom would be waiting for him, ready to take his jacket and massage his feet.And she did it with a smile on her face. She loved my dad. And I didn’t blame him. He was a handsome man, tall, dark-haired, and muscular. Sometimes he made my body ache with desires and I would have to masturbate in my room hoping my twin sister Alice didn’t notice.Now Alice and I weren’t identical twins but fraternal. We looked as much alike as any other normal set of sisters. She was taller and slimmer than I was but my breasts were bigger and my hair finer. It fell in a similar braid to my mother’s down my back, almost the same shade of brown.“Mom, we’re going to be late,” Alice shouted from the car, her head shoved through, her bushy, tawny hair spilling about her delicate face. We both inherited Mom’s small nose and delicate cheekbones, making us look fragile and innocent.“In a moment, dear,” my mom shouted, always full of patience. She turned to me and stroked my hair. “While I’m gone it will be up to you to take care of him, okay. Be obedient and a good girl. I know you will be. You love being a good girl for your daddy.”My cheeks warmed. Ever since I realized that my dad was a muscular hunk beneath the dress shirts he wore for his office job, I found myself wanting to do whatever he said, running errands, fetching him drinks, doing things Mom normally did for him so I could be around him. It made my heart almost float out of my chest when I did.I just wanted to be close to my dad. I was a daddy’s girl, but so were lots of my friends. My friends, including my best friend Sun, were all jealous that I had the cutest dad.Alice, on the other hand, was a brat. I was glad she was going with Mom to Grandma’s. Three weeks of just me and Dad while Mom helped Grandma adjust after Grandpa’s hip surgery. I could have gone, but it was my choice to stay.And I would get to spend so much time with Daddy. So of course I declined. It was so boring at Grandma’s. I loved her and Grandpa, I did, but there was nothing to do there but be board. They barely had internet and no cable, just rabbit ears on a black and white TV.“I’ll be good for Dad,” I smiled.She sighed. “You don’t call him Daddy anymore. I get it, you’re getting older, but it always made him happy when you call him Daddy.”“It does?” I asked, a hot thrill shooting through me. Daddy. It felt so naughty to call him that at my age. I squirmed my hips, my nipples hardening in my bra.She nodded her head. “Now you be good. Do everything he tells you. Eighteen is not too old to be spanked over your father’s knee.”I blushed. Once, I had seen Dad spanking Mom a few weeks ago. They were in their bedroom, but the door had been cracked. It was Saturday and my sister and I were supposed to be weeding the garden. I slipped in to change my clothes—my tight shorts were proving impractical to moving—and heard the slaps. At first, I thought dad was hurting her until I glimpsed her face.Mom loved to be spanked.The image rose in my mind. My mother naked, her large breasts pressing against Dad’s muscular thigh, her round bottom red and wiggling as he slammed his broad hand on her flesh. Her head had risen with each spanking, her toes curling. I caught a glimpse between her legs. She was shaved and looked so youthful. And with her hair braided, she seemed more like a little girl being spanked by her daddy than a wife playing with her husband.I had only watched for a minute before I was so afraid I ran. I burst into my bedroom, shoved my hands down my shorts, and rubbed at my pussy lips. I was so wet. I had never masturbated with such a frenetic need as I pictured Dad’s muscular chest, covered in barbwire tattoos, rippling as he drew back his arm and spanked me.“Melody,” my mother said, bringing me out of my fantasy. “You are going to behave, right?”“I’ll be Daddy’s good girl,” I smiled.“Good.” Dad’s voice rumbled behind me.Startled, I let out a squeak and turned around, my hands clasped before me as Dad, wearing a plain, white t-shirt that molded to his muscles, walked up. Mom lowered her head and clasped her hands before her. Dad stopped before her, ignoring me, and raised her chin.“Dear,” Mom said, “Melody has promised to take care of you while I am gone. I hope she will be a satisfactory replacement.”“Once I have her trained,” Dad answered, his thumb brushing her cheeks.“Good.” A smile played on Mom’s lips. “Then, with your permission, dear, I would like to go and visit my parents.”“Granted.”Permission? Why did Mom need permission?Dad seized Mom’s lips in a kiss. My eyes widened at the unbridled passion. Mom shuddered, her eyes closed while Dad owned her lips. He still held her chin as he kissed her. She moaned, her hips shuddering, her hands squeezed tight together. And then he broke it. Mom took a deep breath, her cheeks flushed.Daddy's GirlDaddy's Girl“I love you, dear.”Dad nodded, his thumb still caressing her cheek, an intimate touch. Wild thoughts of Dad touching me like that spilled through my mind. A heat ignited between my thighs, wet, molten passion. The urge to run upstairs and masturbate seized me as Dad patted Mom’s ass as she walked away, a laugh on her lips and a saucy look in her eyes.They were so affectionate.“Well,” Dad said, staring down at me. He cupped my chin and lifted my eyes. Would he kiss me now? “It is just me and you. Your Mother promises me you will behave.”“Of course ... Daddy.”His lips twitched, a smile almost forming. “Good.” He kissed me on my forehead instead of my lips. My flesh burned where he touched me. I shuddered. “Go fetch me a beer, the game’s about to start.”“Yes, Daddy.” My heart beat in my chest as I turned and raced to the kitchen.I thought I felt Dad’s eyes on my ass. I wore an old pair of jeans—I was supposed to go school shopping with Mom and Alice tomorrow—and they were tight. They hugged my rear and legs. I had grown since I bought them.I hoped he was watching. It made me feel so womanly. Mom was gone. It was my place to be the woman of the house and make sure the man was taken care of.My teachers at school would be horrified. Especially Ms. Gardner and Mrs. Thompson. They were always talking about how women didn’t have to serve men and being a housewife was “internalized misogyny.” But it was nice to serve. It made me happy.What was so wrong with that?Nothing.Of course, I never contradicted my teachers. And I never told them about my mother. She was almost straight out of the ancient TV show that sometimes appeared on Nickelodeon late at night—Leave it to Beaver. But she wasn’t faking her happiness. She was always humming and singing as she cooked or clean.“Your father earns the money and provides for us,” she would say, “and he works hard to do it. So I work just as hard at home making our life pleasant. Your father appreciates what I do, and I appreciate what he does. We compliment each other.”Hearing her say it made it sound like the most romantic thing in the world.My head buzzed with images of me being Daddy’s wife. Cooking and cleaning, waiting for him to come home, then I would massage his feet after his hard day while we talked. They always laughed when Mom massaged his feet. It was their private time. Alice and I were banished to our bedrooms or elsewhere during it.I brought the beer to Daddy.“Thank you, Melody,” he said, taking it and giving me a nod.“You’re welcome, Daddy,” I smiled.He patted the arm of his recliner while the announcer called the baseball game. The Mariners were playing the A’s, and the first pitch had just been thrown. I sat on the chair’s arm and leaned back, Daddy’s arm going around my waist.It was wonderful. I smiled, loving being near him even if it meant watching a boring baseball game. Twice more he sent me to get him another beer. I returned with his drink and diet cokes for myself. I even started getting into the game, and when the Mariners won, Daddy hugged me to his chest.He smelled so manly. The hot itch returned to me. I squirmed, my cheeks burning, suddenly so embarrassed. “I have to go make dinner, Daddy.”“Okay, sweetheart.” He kissed me on the forehead.I crawled off the recliner, my thighs squeezed tight. I really did have to start dinner, but I wanted to masturbate so badly. “Daddy, Mom was supposed to take me clothing shopping tomorrow.”“I’ll take you.” his eyes fell on mine. So strong. “But you won’t buy anything without my approval.”Part of me wanted to revolt. What did my dad know about clothes? He would probably try to dress me like Mom. Long skirts, loose blouses, nothing to show off my growing body. I liked to dress in tight jeans, short shorts, and daring skirts. But I had promised to be a good girl for Daddy.“Okay, Daddy.”“Good girl,” he smiled.My heart thudded for joy.Daddy’s GirlDaddy’s GirlI was so tired the next morning. I couldn’t sleep last night. Thoughts of taking over all of Mom’s duties for Daddy filled my thoughts. I had rubbed my poor pussy raw masturbating last night. But I couldn’t stop. The idea gripped me. Massaging his feet, stripping him naked, laying beneath him as he pumped his cock in and out of me.I knew about sex. Several of my friends had had sex, and they told me all about how disappointing the boys were the first times. “I wish I had a man do it,” they all said. “Someone older and sexier. Like your Dad, Melody.”“I would totally let your dad pop my cherry,” Sun had giggled.“Older men know how to get the job done,” Tiffany had proclaimed. “Trust me.”“Every girl knows it,” agreed Donna. “But good luck finding an older man that isn’t a perv. He needs to be perfect. I bet your Dad would be perfect. Maybe I should spend the night.”I had said no. There was no way I was letting Donna near my dad, not with the hungry look in her eye.Now my thoughts were consumed with him. We were all alone. Three times I stood up and walked to my bedroom door, set on walking down the hall and slipping into bed with Daddy. But it was also so scary. I wanted him so badly, but incest was wrong. He wouldn’t want to sleep with me and cheat on Mom.He was a good man not a pervert.The third time I had stood at my door, gripping the nub, my stomach twisting. I listened. The house was so quiet. I strained to hear him in his bedroom. I imagined him awake, burning with desires for me, waiting for me to come and perform Mom’s wifely duties with him.But I chickened out and ran back to my bed. And then masturbated to another orgasm.I almost overslept and forgot to make Daddy breakfast. But I remembered at the last minute and rushed downstairs wearing only my thin nightgown. I whipped up Sunday breakfast and had it ready when Daddy came down at his usual 8 AM.It was after breakfast he took me to the mall. I held his arm as we walked through the mall. I noticed the other girls and women who looked at them and a prideful surge went through him. He was desired but he was mine.Until Mom got back.I led Daddy to the first store, pulling him past the shoplifting detectors and into the vibrant clothing store. Everywhere I looked were frilly, feminine items. Daddy was the opposite of it all, standing tall, muscular, hunky.“I only want you to buy skirts,” Daddy said. “I like my girls in skirts.”“Is that why Mom never wears jeans or pants?”Daddy nodded. “And you’re at that age where you should do the same.”“But long skirts, like Mom? Hers are so boring.”A smile crossed his lips. “Sweetheart, buy the shortest, tightest skirts you want. You have gorgeous legs. Let Daddy see them.”Heat rushed up my legs. “Yes, Daddy,” I squeaked then turned away, my cheeks on fire. Daddy wanted to see my legs. I wish I was wearing a skirt right now instead of stupid shorts.There were so many wonderful skirts. Short tennis skirts, pleated skirts, pencil skirts, flowery skirts, knee-length skirts, mid-thigh skirts, even shorter ones. I felt so daring when I grabbed on of those, imagining it only falling past my rear and not much else. It would show off so much of my legs. Daddy didn’t complain as I handed him another skirt to hold. He threw them over his muscular arms, a patient smile on his lips as he glanced at what I bought.I liked flashy skirts with bright colors, drawing the eye.And then I had to find blouses to go with them. We headed across the store where I snagged halter tops, peasant blouses, V-necks, scoop necks, baby doll t-shirts, belly shirts. With each one I considered which bottom it would go with, making my outfit plans. This top could go with three different skirts, bu this one only went with one. I took the top that could match three skirts.Variety. I needed to mix up my clothing. I couldn’t wear the same outfit combinations all the time.With a dozen blouses and skirts chosen, I headed into the back for the changing rooms. “I can’t wait to see how pretty you look,” Daddy said as I closed the door.My cheeks blushed. I looked out the louvered slats. I could sort of see through them from my side, glimpsing his legs in his blue jeans while I pulled off the t-shirt I wore. A sudden surge of excitement went through me as I wiggled out of my shorts.I was almost naked in here and Daddy was just on the other side.I grabbed a knee-length skirt and a halter top that went well with it, adjusting my bra. I would have to get a strapless bra to wear with the halter top, my straps were too obvious. I stared at myself in the mirror, turning, loving how my braid of dark-brown hair fell down my back, almost reaching the soft swell of my rear. The skirt fell lovely across my butt. I shifted my hips, loving how the hem swayed about my legs.“You dressed yet?”“Coming, Daddy,” I giggled. “You need to be patient when girls are trying on clothing.”“I’m not good at patience. I like to take what I want.”A hot wave rushed through me. I almost said, “You can take me, Daddy,” but that would be absolutely stupid.I stepped out, standing before him, suddenly so afraid. What if he hated it. His arms folded before him, his eyes studying me as I fidgeted. I played with my fingers before him, wishing he would say something.“Straighten your back,” he said. “And turn around. Let me get a good look at you.”Daddy's GirlDaddy's Girl“Yes, Daddy,” I said, my spine snapping straight. Then I turned, putting a little sway into my hips to really make the skirt swirl. “Do you ... like it, Daddy?”“The skirt’s a little long,” he said, “but your top is great. We’ll need to get you a strapless bra. Unless you already own one?”“I don’t, Daddy.”“We’ll fix that.”I swallowed then reached for the door and opened it. I slipped in. Only the door didn’t close behind me right away. I turned and gasped as Daddy stood in there with me, his arms folded, his eyes on me as I clutched the next top.“Well, this will be faster,” he nodded, his eyes rolling up and down my body. “You won’t have to keep coming and going.”“I ... I don’t think it’s allowed for you to be in here, Daddy,” I trembled.“I don’t care.” His eyes were so dark and commanding. “Now change. Show me your next lovely outfit.”“Yes, Daddy.”I hastened to obey him. I pulled off the halter top. I felt so naked in just my bra, cupping my round breasts. My nipples were so hard, poking at the front. I don’t know why. I had worn my bikini around Daddy before and it showed just as much flesh. I wiggled out of my skirt, bending over to step out of it and pointing my panty-clad rear at Daddy.“Cute pair,” he said. “Black. I like them.”“Black? What...” My panties. My cheeks burned even more and the hot itch between my thighs swelled. “Thank you, Daddy.”“You’re growing up so fast.”I straightened and pulled on a red, V necked blouse and turned to face him.His cock bulged the front of his jeans. I froze, half-pulling on the top, my right arm through the sleeve, my left arm searching for the armhole. I sucked in a deep breath. Daddy was turned on right now.I turned him on.“Keep changing,” he ordered. “Don’t stop. I need to approve all your outfits.”“D-do you approve all of Mom’s?”“Why do you think I take her shopping? Your mother dresses to please me. She’s a good girl. And I know you want to be just like her, another good girl for Daddy.”“I do,” I whispered. I pulled the top over my head and pulled my braid out the back. Then I grabbed a jean skirt I thought would be quite cute with this top. I stepped into the skirt, pulling it up my hips. It was tight. I sucked in a breath to get it up over me and then zipped up the side. It fell to my mid-thigh, a few artfully worn through spots showing off my pale thighs beneath.Daddy nodded his head as I turned. “Now bend over,” he ordered. “Touch your toes.”“Yes, Daddy.”I knew I had to do it with my ass facing him. I bent over, the skirt sliding up my thighs, revealing more and more of my flesh. I almost wished it was short enough to flash my panties at Daddy. The hot itch between my legs grew even hotter. I had to be wet, my panties soaking up my excitement.I wanted to escape to a bathroom and masturbate.“D-do you like them?” A tremble ran through me.“They are perfect. You have great taste in clothing.” His hand stroked my bare thigh right beneath the hem of my skirt. I shuddered and moaned, the blood rushing to my head as I stayed bent over. What was he doing. “Just perfect. Okay, try on the next.”My virgin body trembled as I turned. I could still feel his hand on my thigh even though he stopped touching me. It was the most intimate contact I had ever had with another person. I didn’t date much—Daddy didn’t approve and, unlike Alice, I was a good girl. I had barely kissed a boy let alone let one really touch me.It was amazing to feel his hand on me. As I stripped down to my underwear, I wanted Daddy to touch me again.I grabbed the one very short skirt I selected. I had never worn a miniskirt before. It was made of a stretchy, black material that hugged my ass when I pulled it on. It felt so exposed. It ended right below my butt-cheek. As I pulled on a purple belly skirt with dangling, golden fringes around the hem, I felt like at any moment the skirt would slide up my flesh and expose my panties.“Now that is a skirt,” Daddy said, as I faced him, the tasseled fringes caressing my belly and back as they swayed. “Yes, it is. Turn around. Let me see your ass.”“Yes, Daddy.”I turned, so aware that I was turning him on. He groaned. His hands reached out, touching me. It was so wrong. No father should touch his daughter like that, especially not when she was underage, but I didn’t care. It was so wonderful. His hands so strong as they squeezed me.“That’s my good girl,” he whispered as his hands kneaded me. “Mmm, you’re making Daddy so happy. Now bend over. Let’s see how this skirt moves.”“Yes, Daddy.”My pussy clenched as I bent over. He let go of my ass as I did. I gasped when I pressed back into his cock bulging his jeans. I felt it along the top of my ass as I bent over, my braid falling to the floor. I fought the urge to grind back against him. My pussy was so itchy. I wanted to be touched.Needed to be touched.I didn’t care if it was my Daddy doing the touching.That would just make it hotter.“What a gorgeous skirt,” he groaned, gripping my hips. He moved, sliding his bulge up and down against my ass, moving it lower. It pressed against my pussy. I felt him through all our clothing. So big. So thick. Was he bigger than a normal guy? What would he feel like in me?Incestuous passions gripped me. I wanted my father to fuck me right here, right now.“Melody, kneel,” he ordered, grinding harder against me.”“Kneel?”His hand smacked on my ass. I yelped as the burning pain shot through me.

Chapter 1 – Mandate

The sun is rising.
I haven’t slept—but nobody is expected to on briefing mornings. The corridors still glisten from the night crew’s bleach, trophy cases half-lit like aquariums holding extinct fish. In the hush before dawn, the Institute belongs to the hum of freezers and the distant, tidal burble of pumps that keep lab specimens alive. When Dr Hana Okoye calls, you come. The message on my phone was spare, but the time-stamp said enough. Someone wants answers before the sun can interrogate them.
Briefing 6 is a steep lecture amphitheater meant for sixty; only Okoye and I stand inside, the screen a single blue rectangle casting submarine light. She graces me with a crisp nod—approval for punctuality, not friendship—then dims the house lights.
A topographic model floats above the projector table: an island-shaped vertebra, all swooping ridges and scalloped coves. Labels blink coordinates several thousand kilometers into the emptiest South Pacific.

“I don't know much about it ” she says. “Emerged five weeks ago.”
An island that new should thrill me; instead I just feel small. “Emerged how?”
“Not sure yet.” Okoye gestures, and the model peels open in translucent layers. “Seismic data’s contradictory—volcanic signatures without heat, tectonic uplift without plate motion. Composition’s basalt glass laced with abnormal sodium crystals. The rock is…leaching.”
Leaching. The word bumps a mental filing cabinet full of disaster reports but stops short of alarm. Keep the dread banked, I remind myself; we’re still on polished linoleum, not open water.
She advances satellite photos in nine-day increments. The atoll balloons from a dark reef knot to a horseshoe of beach and cliff. Gulls wheel overhead in messy loops but never touch down.
Okoye closes the slideshow. “We need an on-site survey before corporate or government teams trample it. One scientist, minimal footprint, 2 weeks...” she paused. “Solo.”
She shrugs. “Budget and plausible deniability both like small numbers.” A folder slides toward me. The contract inside could buy twelve years of baby formula and wipe our mortgage. My pulse ticks faster—but not from fear, not yet; more like the thrill of securing the future in a single stroke. I sign. The pen squeaks; otherwise the room is silent.

Marine rocks Bean beside the window, twilight painting both of them orange. When I tell her the duration—two weeks—her mouth tightens in a line, but she listens through the details. The money lands like a stone on still water: a deep splash, circles of possibility.
“It’s our chance to breathe,” I finish. “No debt. College fund started before he can crawl.”
She presses Bean’s tiny fist to her cheek. “Promise you’ll come back.""
""I promise."" I echo, and kiss them both.

The Echion bobs -impatient, familiar. This feels like a memory. The 28-foot sloop with more antennas than sails after its retrofit, is loaded with my gear while Marin hovers with the baby carrier strapped across her chest. Bean gurgles whenever gulls wheel overhead. Weather looks kind: high pressure, a long low swell marching in lazy ranks. Perfect conditions—exactly what you want at the start of an expedition so nobody tempts fate by saying so aloud. We do the prolonged dockside goodbye: jokes about freeze-dried cuisine, reminders to video-call, a final hesitant kiss that ends too soon. Then ropes thunk onto the deck, engine coughs to life, and the pier eases away like scenery pulled on rails. Marin’s silhouette shrinks until she’s just a bright fleck waving a mittened hand. I wave back, heart buoyant and somehow calm.

The open Pacific behaves itself. Rolling cobalt plains, an occasional albatross slicing the spray. I run plankton trawls to kill time, record log entries about nothing unusual—because nothing is. On the second night clouds scab over the stars, but the barometer holds steady. I brew coffee with real grounds (Marin’s parting gift) and think of ways to describe a sunrise over emptiness for Bean’s baby journal.

Dead stirs when the GPS pings the final leg. The island lies less than one hundred nautical miles ahead—close, but distant enough to remain myth. A wind-shift wakes me—a quick slap to the hull. Radar shows a squall line muscling in from the west. I shorten sail, check lashings. Nothing heroic; standard seamanship. Through morning the squall grows into a broad smear—rain so thick it blinds the horizon. Seas stack, whitecaps shredding under gusts. The Echion rides well, but progress slows to a crawl. I log conditions in clipped phrases. The storm feels like an exam I studied for: difficult, not dangerous. My nerves stay level.

The night is velvet black punctured by sheet lightning. Each flash sketches a wall of cloud shaped like a cathedral organ pipe. Beautiful—if you have the luxury to admire. The wind eases and barometer rises. I crack the cabin hatch and smell ozone and fresh-washed air. The sea glows faintly with plankton stirred to phosphorescence. Somewhere beyond the darkness waits land. Dawn bleeds up the sky. In the pink haze, the island appears—a jagged silhouette, more fortress than island. Cliffs curve inward like hooked fingers; a black-sand skirt rims the base. No smoke, no vegetation, only stark geometry. I exhale a long, low whistle that fogs in the cool air. Excitement edges finally into unease—but still no horror. I’ve seen stranger landscapes through a submersible viewport. Radio check: static. Sat-link handshake fails. Probably weather residual.
Time to work.

Anchor set in twenty fathoms; depth sounder returns odd double-echoes, like hollow chambers beneath the seafloor, but nothing alarming. I ride the acheon across a slow swell toward shore. The beach is coarse obsidian sand that glitters under sun like ground glass. Temperature reads ten degrees above the surrounding ocean—a mild radiant warmth baked from the cliff faces. I nose the inflatable onto the shelf, drag it above tide line, and survey: no driftwood, no rotting kelp piles, no shells. The tidemark is surgically clean. Walking inland thirty meters I plant a collapsible mast for the portable relay, switch it on—no carrier lock. I log the fault, upload attempt queued. Again, nothing scary—equipment fails, satellites drop. It’s only when the silence draws itself out—no gulls, no insects, not even the click of sand under the breeze—that my scalp tightens. Still, a scientist explains silence before he fears it. I jot wind and temperature readings, sketch the cliff profile, decide tomorrow I’ll sample the glassy rock upridge.

Dusk comes fast; sunset turns the cliffs blood-red. I pitch the expedition tent, cook freeze-dried risotto, note an odd briny tang that clings to every breath but write it off as proximity to fresh volcanic glass. Before turning in, I sweep the perimeter with a flashlight just in case. That’s when I find the tracks. Footprints—human-sized, more or less—but the toes are long, jointed strangely. The prints describe a broad circle around camp, as though someone paced a constraint. The sand inside the ring, where my tent stands, is untouched. My pulse quickens. I photograph the impressions, measure stride length, then retreat to the tent. I tell myself another research crew must have landed briefly—though the prints are fresh in sand no wind has disturbed all day.

The night is empty of sound. I lie awake listening to my heart drum against the nylon floor, counting the seconds between gusts. When sleep takes me it feels like falling into water. That night, something brushed the tent wall—probably the wind. The tide is out; the surf booms a hundred meters away like distant artillery. I unzip the flap, sweep the beam across the beach. The circle of prints is gone, effaced by a fresh scatter of marks leading seaward. The tide hasn’t reached them yet. Nothing moves in the flashlight cone. Nothing answers when I call out. Goosebumps creep up my arms. The island finally has a voice—silence shaped into threat. I retreat, zip the flap, and record this log entry. My hands are steady but cold. No other anomalies. Attempting to  sleep again.

I wake to complete radio failure. The portable relay’s indicator lamp is dark—battery drained despite full charge. My wrist GPS shows time but no satellites. The Echion rides at anchor beyond the faint mist—reassuring, until I train binoculars on the chain and see flecks of white corrosion already stippling the steel. Salt air works fast here. Faster than it should.
Over coffee I examine the beach. Overnight waves erased most of the strange tracks, but a few partial prints remain—enough to show the bifurcated heel I missed in the dark. Dread is now a constant pressure behind my sternum, but it’s clear-eyed. Something shares this island; something avoids daylight.

I plan the day: climb the lower cliff ramp, obtain rock cores, map thermal gradients. Science as warding charm. My left palm itches as I shoulder the sample pack. Habit makes me glance; the skin is normal. No lesions, no salt spurs. For some reason I sigh relief I didn’t know I needed. I step inland, toward the ridgeline where the island waits to introduce itself.


Chapter 2 – Gradient

The sun is low
I dream of churning water and feel it in my lungs when I wake. The tent is full of pale morning light. For a moment, I lie still, cataloguing everything I can sense: no wind, no birds, no sound but the distant pull of surf. The air smells metallic—more than yesterday. Salt and copper. Something like rusted blood. I unzip the tent and step into a world sharpened by the cold. Mist has settled over the black sand, curling around my boots as I make my way to the relay. Still dead. I tap the casing as if that would wake it. The wrist GPS still refuses to find satellites. The Echion floats offshore, haloed in the morning mist. Binoculars confirm the corrosion is worse—bright lichen blooms of white chewing through steel. Something about the pattern is off. Corrosion doesn’t move like that. It doesn’t follow curves like handwriting. I eat in silence. There’s no appetite. The food has a wrongness to it—texture just slightly gummy, like it’s soaked in humidity I can’t feel. The freeze-dried risotto tastes like it has been cooked with seawater. I make myself eat anyway. Routine is armor. The ridge waits. A path curves up the cliff face, less trail and more suggestion. The basalt glass is tacky underfoot, full of strange tension. My boots cling slightly, like walking across dried syrup. Thirty meters up, I stop. The view is vast: the curve of the atoll surrounding the dark lagoon, its surface rippling in ways that don’t match the wind. The water shimmers like oil, colors sliding across it when I don’t look directly. At the ridgeline, the ground levels into a plateau of black rock veined with pale streaks of sodium crystal. I take samples, chip away careful cores, label them, but the labels feel absurd now. What am I going to write? Leaching core sample A, warm to touch, hummed once when removed from soil. Because it did. Just for a moment. A little hum. Subaudible.

The horizon swims. I squat and breathe until my balance returns. I must be dehydrated. The sun overhead looks... strange. Slightly egg-shaped. I blink hard and it resumes being a circle. Moving farther inland, I find a depression—a smooth sinkhole surrounded by jagged columns that resemble teeth. Inside, water shivers, but there’s no wind. The surface pulses outward at regular intervals. Not random. Not natural. There’s something about the geometry here. The cliffs lean inward, subtly. The horizon lines converge in ways they shouldn’t. I try to sketch and realize my hand is shaking. The drawing won’t obey perspective. The longer I spend looking at the land, the less of it I seem to understand. The sun doesn’t move properly. It stays high and a little too bright, refusing to slide across the sky. Hours pass in that same overhead glare, making it impossible to know when to stop. When I finally descend, the beach is different. The zodiac has moved—dragged higher on the shore by a few meters, resting at a strange angle. The sand shows no tracks. I call out. I don’t know why. Just to fill the silence. The echo that comes back is wrong. It reaches me a full two seconds late, too crisp, like it passed through metal. It doesn’t match the rhythm of my words. The smell though, all too familiar. It was Marin's shampoo.

I stare at the footprints around the camp. They’re gone again. Only mine remain, and even those seem shallow. Like I barely touched the earth. That night, I lie awake in the tent. No logs. No scientific diction. Just the rawness of my own thoughts. I don’t know what day it is. I don’t know what this place is made of. I don’t think the island was ever supposed to be above water. There’s a rustling outside. Not sand. Not wind. Something brushing the side of the tent. I hold my breath. It circles once, then again. Then silence.

In the morning, I find three things:
1. The relay has been opened. Not smashed—opened, as though by someone who understood its function.
2. My boots are filled with a fine, crystalline dust. It stings the skin.
3. There’s a small, precise incision along my left palm. Not bleeding. Not clotted. Just... there. A clean line, symmetrical. I don’t remember it happening.

The day is heavy with sunless light. Everything glows a little. I hike along the western slope, drawn by instinct more than plan. The landscape seems to rearrange when I’m not looking—crags shifting subtly. I lose sight of the ocean, a long with waves that usually remind me of Bean's smile. I find another depression, this one deeper. At its center lies a cavity in the rock, and from it seeps a steam that smells sweet and dead. Bones litter the rim. Small ones. Some look human. Others don’t look like anything. I kneel at the edge. The heat rising from the hole pulses like breath. I lean closer. My reflection in the shimmer is not mine—just a suggestion of shape, longer fingers, a mouth that doesn’t end. I fall back, gasping. The hallucination lingers for too long. I retreat to camp. I don’t remember how I get there.

At sunset—or what I think is sunset, though the sun never really moved—I feel a great silence descend. The sea quiets. Even my breath seems muffled. Then the screaming starts. It’s distant, carried on no wind. Not a single voice. A choir of overlapping howls, human and not. I crawl into the tent and zip it shut. I curl in the corner, flashlight clenched in both hands. The screaming doesn’t stop. It doesn’t stop for a long time. When it does, something laughs. Once. Deep. I sleep. I wake. There’s no distinction.

My skin peels slightly at the fingertips. My left palm’s incision is now flanked by tiny, hair-fine ridges, like growth plates in bone. I speak aloud just to hear my voice. It echoes strangely. My mouth feels full of heat. I try to pray. Not for rescue, not anymore. Just to be remembered. Just to be known by someone other than this place. The island doesn’t want me dead.


Chapter 3 – Memory

There is no sun now.
Not above, not behind clouds—just a flat white sheen like paper soaked in milk. The sky glows without source. I can’t remember how many days it’s been. The tent collapsed sometime in the night, or maybe I tore it down. I woke up lying in the sand with my mouth open to the sky, tasting something bitter and cool that left no moisture. I don’t check the relay anymore. The Echion is still visible, but further now—receded, or maybe it never moved and I did. I try not to look at it too long. The boat is the last lie I haven’t dismantled. My hands don’t look like mine. The incision on my palm has split like a blossom. From the open skin sprout fine white filaments—coiled and ridged like the antennae of deep-sea shrimp. I can feel things through them. Taste the air differently. The salt is sweet now. The dirt has flavor. There’s a rhythm in the island’s pulse. A slow, thunderless beat deep beneath the basalt. At first I thought it was tectonic movement. Now I know better.

I spend hours—maybe longer—wandering the ridge paths barefoot. The ground no longer cuts me. The sodium crystals have grown across the rocks like frost, forming symbols in no language. In a clear pool at the plateau’s edge, I see my reflection. My eyes are black now—not bruised, but colorless. The skin along my ribs has thinned, as if my organs are shifting outward. I laugh, but it’s not madness. It’s understanding. The mind was a cage. The new thoughts aren’t louder—they’re clearer.

I speak the island’s name. It isn’t in any alphabet, but my throat shapes it easily now. Saying it makes the trees grow, even though there are no trees. I know what waits beneath. I descend into the depression again, the one lined with bones. The teeth-like spires have grown taller, converging overhead into an open jaw. The pool is gone—just smooth, dark stone now, like a lens or a lid. I kneel. I press my changed hand to the stone. It opens.

The descent is slow. A spiral tunnel of warm glass and pulsing veins. The air is wet and close, but I do not choke. I breathe as if I never needed lungs. I do not fall—I am drawn. At the bottom is a chamber. Vast. Unmeasurable. Filled with pillars shaped like spinal cords and fluted shells. Floating in the center is a shape—not a creature, not quite—but a presence wrapped in layers of itself, folded like memory. It knows me. I kneel. I listen. It tells me the truth. 

I died at sea.

The storm. The lightning. The crack of mast and skull. The Echion never reached the island. My body drifted to a reef of glass. My mind arrived later. This place is not an island. It is a wound in the sea. A scar memory in the world’s mind. A place where lost things gather. I remember the tracks around the tent. I left them. I remember the incision in my palm. I made it. I remember the calls on the radio—there never were any. The relay was a toy. The science, a prayer. There was never a survey. Never a contract. There was only the pull. I stand now in the chamber beneath the world and I weep, because the shape that called me here is the last thing I will ever understand—and the first thing I have ever truly seen. It whispers a final word: Home. And I step forward.

I do not remember how long I spend beneath. Time becomes something soft and fibrous that wraps around the edges of my thoughts. I forget my voice. I forget the feel of sunlight on my face. There is only warmth and soundless pressure, like being deep in the ocean, or inside the memory of a womb.
The shape feeds me—not with food, but with knowing. It offers images, and I take them hungrily. I see myself through another’s eyes: Marin, weeping on the dock. The child, Bean, not crying, just staring at the place where I vanished. I feel Marin’s hope shrink over months into a hollow. I see the search reports, the empty sea. I see the Echion’s floating corpse. I do not weep for them. I should. But the part of me that knew sorrow is somewhere far above, suspended in a tide I can’t reach. I know their love mattered. I know I promised. But yeh island has eaten that promise, digested it. Now it pulses in the dark beside the others. Yes—others. There are more like me here. Not visible, not walking. But their thoughts skim the edges of mine. Scientists. Sailors. Refugees. Dreamers. Some died in fire. Others stepped through dreams. Some never even knew what pulled them until they were pieces of thought smeared across the glass. We are salt memories now, coiled in the folds of something ancient. And it is not evil. It does not care in the way we think of caring. It is an ark. A mausoleum. A god. A disease. A mouth that forgets how to stop chewing. I sleep and wake without difference. At some point, I emerge. The island has changed. Or perhaps I see it now for what it always was. The island is not made of stone, but of tooth and sinew petrified into landscape. The cliffs are ribs. The beach is the flaked rind of skin. And in the center, where I once landed, lies a new thing:

A man-shaped impression in the sand. A hollow where my body used to be. Above it stands something tall and porcelain. Its surface is smooth as bone, but pocked with divots—almost like eyes, almost like mouths. It moves with grace, insect-like, and tilts its head as I approach. It is me. Not a copy. Not a replacement. It is what I have become. What was inside me, waiting to molt.
I watch it vanish into the cliffs. Not walking—gliding. Becoming mist. I do not follow. I look up at the skyless dome and scream—but the scream is not of terror. It is song. My voice joins the chorus of the deep. And in it I hear thousands. Then I see Marin again. Not in memory—but standing, barefoot, on the black sand. Eyes hollow with grief. Behind her, the child walks—a toddler now, cheeks red from salt air. How did they get here? Why would they come? Then I understand. The island called them. Just as it called me. Just as it calls everything broken and searching. I run to her. I try to shout her name, but my voice is wind. My body is salt. I pass through her like steam through water. And she shivers, and pulls the child closer, and walks toward the cliffs. The porcelain shape watches from above. I cannot stop them. The island will have them.

I am no longer man or voice or memory. I am part of the deep rhythm. I am the hum between waves. I am the circle around their camp. I am the footprints they will find. I am the dread that wakes beneath silence.
The stars took what I was, so I wept salt until I wasn’t.

1lo0307,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogattacksurvivors/comments/1lo0307/my_dog_is_a_survivor_fingers_crossed/,My dog is a survivor. Fingers crossed.,"Preface. I am in Australia for anyone confused by seasons references and timezones. Sunday was my worst nightmare.  I’ve always been cautious around big dogs off leash. I only ever walk my three dogs one at a time, and if I even so much as see a large dog—even on a lead—I’ll turn and take an alternate route. It’s often annoyed my partner, who thought I was being paranoid.

Yesterday I slept in, so I didn’t do their usual one-on-one walks. Instead, we went for coffee and decided to take all three dogs together when it had warmed up a little. I had our youngest while my partner walked the two older dogs. We were just about to head home (Our 16 year old schnoodle had reached his limit) when we heard someone yell, panicked, “Loose dog!”

I immediately ran and picked the 3 year old schnauzer up. Partner scooped up the geriatric  and also had our westie pom in his arms when the dog got to us. It grabbed her and started shaking her like a toy. My partner was trying to get it off. Soon the owner, a young strong guy in his teens or 20’s was on top of the dog, managing to stop it from shaking her further, but we couldn’t get its jaws to release.

Partner was pressing his foot against the dog’s forehead, the owner had his arms wrapped around it, and everyone was yelling. The owner just kept screaming “I’m so sorry.” Eventually the dog let go. We didn’t get the owner’s details—we just had to get the other dogs and our injured pup away as fast as possible. The walk home felt like the longest of my life. We immediately got in the car and rushed her to the hospital.

She was bleeding and in shock, and we couldn’t tell how bad the injuries were. She was very lucky—none of her organs were irreparably  punctured, especially her lungs, though she has bruising there we’ll need to monitor carefully. She had surgery and came thru okay.

In any long-term relationship there’s sometimes a temptation to feel smug about being right, to say “I told you so.” I feel none of that. I wish I had been wrong. I wish my partner hadn’t had to experience that. He’s lost the simple pleasure of being able to walk our dogs in our own suburb without fear. It feels like something has been stolen from us. But our brave girl is still here.

I don’t know yet if she’ll pull through. The vets have done all they can. She goes back in tomorrow to see them again. 

We’ve been in touch with Domestic Animal Services in our city. They’re opening an investigation, but there’s very little to go on. While our girl was in surgery, we warned some other local dog owners—partly so they could be careful, and partly because it was something we could do while we waited were powerless, waiting. I feel guilty for not getting the owners details. I feel guilty for walking my three dogs, safely on a leash. I feel like I failed as a dog Mum. This was my worst nightmare. Anyone with any stories of survival please share them.

1lnzzui,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1lnzzui/my_roommate_and_i_kind_of_feel_like_a_couple/,My roommate and I… kind of feel like a couple?,"Okay, I know that might sound like the start of a typical crush story — but it’s not that, I promise!

We’ve lived together for around two and a half years. We didn’t know each other super well before he moved in, but since then, we’ve become incredibly close. Like, we do everything together — watching TV, working side by side on our laptops, gaming, going out, grocery runs, grabbing coffee… you name it. We call each other after work, cook meals for each other, pick up little things the other needs, give each other rides — it’s honestly endless. Our lives are totally connected.

And I’ve started to realize… this is exactly the kind of stuff couples usually do, right? There’s nothing romantic or sexual between us, but it feels like more than just a standard friendship.

I won’t pretend — I love it. I love having him around all the time. And I genuinely think he feels the same. We never get sick of being together, and there’s something about it that’s so comforting and complete. I haven’t even felt the urge to date or hook up with anyone else.

1lnzzq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lnzzq6/aita_for_cutting_everyone_in_my_friend_group_out/,AITA for cutting everyone in my friend group out?,"I (21F) am a second-year college student. I broke up with my ex, Tom, in March. The relationship ended badly. He was manipulative, emotionally dismissive, and the breakup left me wrecked. During that time, my best friend Julia (also 21F) was my main support system. She knew everything.

Fast forward to may, Julia started acting weird around me. She was hanging out with Tom a lot. At first I told myself maybe they were just talking, but then mutual friends started teasing them about being a couple. They’d go on one-on-one coffee runs, “accidentally” show up at events together, post subtle stories… all while claiming there was “nothing going on.” 

What made it worse? Our entire friend group saw it happen. A few of them even privately told me it was weird and they’d be just as upset if it happened to them. So I made a quiet choice to just distance myself from Julia, no drama, no fight. I just stopped engaging cuz i would be mad at myself if I continued brushing it off. The only person I confided in was someone I trusted, Kelly. I told her I was distancing myself from Julia and why. I knew she’d tell people, so I gave her permission mainly cuz I wanted to see what she’d do with it. And unsurprisingly, word got out within less than a week and a few people removed and unfollowed me on several platforms. I guess she might’ve twisted my words or something cuz even my college classmates look at me weirdly when I come into the lecture hall.

Now, a month later, every single person in the group is cold with me. Some are fake-nice. Some ignore me completely. Some act like I started drama for quietly removing myself from a dynamic that made me feel betrayed.
These are the same people who said they’d drop Julia if they were in my shoes, they also knew how Tom treated me. I’m not looking to patch things up. I’ve accepted it but I still have to see these people on campus. I also question myself a lot, maybe it would’ve been better if I’d just shut up and not tell anyone my thoughts but yeah it’s been a month.

Did i over-react? What would you have done in my position?

No profile-photo swiping.

Many people are tired of the swiping, the small talk, and the disconnect. People aren’t giving up on dating, but they are giving up on dating apps that feel empty.

The space isn’t going anywhere, but it’s clearly ready for something better.

Early testers of our beta loved what we built and say this could be the next big thing.
Now we’re gearing up for V2, aiming for a public release within the next two quarters, and we’re looking for a CTO / co-founder who shares the belief that dating can feel more genuine, intentional, and human.

⸻

Where we are
• Flutter beta live on iOS & Android
• Multiple test rounds, about 100 participants, 90% keen to return
• Beta paused; hundreds on the waitlist
• Investor talks in progress, public launch within two quarters
• Equity-only co-founder role (split negotiable)

⸻

You might be a fit if you
• Live in (or can regularly work from) Sydney
• Ship confidently with Flutter & Firebase (or similar cloud stack)
• Enjoy using AI tools to iterate fast
• Want full technical ownership and believe dating can be intentional, not transactional

⸻

Interested? DM:
• Two or three projects you’re proud of
• When you could grab coffee or hop on a quick call

Meanwhile, I have made yet another jelly because I know that she will not drink and needs to stay hydrated somehow. Another summer that I have to fight through. The carers will not encourage her to drink, even I cannot encourage to make her drink unless I sit down with her for 30 minutes at a time. They also leave the same glass of water all day unless I am here to change them for cold water. Unfortunately, I have limited time as I still need to work, pay the bills, cook dinner, do school runs etc. It is draining, why can they not see this?

I am sitting here realising this is far from a break.

The amount of cortisol running through my body must be immense. I do love my grandmother and appreciate all she had done for me after my mother passed away as a child, however, after five years of caring for her. I am seeing that I am half the person I used to be.

Whether it’s a clogged drip system, a faulty pump, or buttons that stop responding, it feels like most machines are built to break.

This issue isn’t just about money—it’s about the morning ritual. People want reliability without constantly replacing parts or upgrading to the latest model. Common complaints include plastic components wearing out, buildup from hard water, or lack of proper maintenance instructions.

So, is there a coffee maker that truly lasts?

Yes—but it often comes down to choosing the right brand, proper upkeep, and sometimes paying a bit more upfront. Brands like Technivorm Moccamaster, Bonavita, and Breville have strong reputations for durability. Many users report these machines lasting 5–10 years with basic maintenance. Look for models with metal components, simple designs, and replaceable parts.

To extend the life of your machine, regular descaling (especially if you have hard water), cleaning after each use, and avoiding overuse of pods in all-in-one brewers can make a big difference. Some even opt for manual brewers like French presses or pour-over setups—they last practically forever and have fewer parts to fail.

In the end, a long-lasting coffee maker does exist—it just might require a little more care and a smarter purchase decision.",1,1751261969.0,ProductIntel,0,1.0,False

When I told my mom, she said she was proud of me… but also told me I was stupid for doing it. The other day, I was about a dollar short for a taxi fare and my dad made a snide remark that really stung. Yesterday, I asked my brother to grab coffee and said I’d pay him back today. And today, I haven’t gone out yet to withdraw cash. It was less than $10! My sister heard about it and said I shouldn’t have donated my money if I can’t even pay for coffee. I can pay for coffee. I just didn’t have physical cash on me at that moment. I wasn’t asking for a handout or charity. I just needed a little flexibility from the people closest to me.  I’m really surprised by the way they’ve been treating me. On the one hand, they say they’re proud. On the other, it feels like they’re ridiculing me for my decisions, even though I’ve never asked them for anything substantial. I feel judged and kind of hurt.

I've been living in Suzhou for nearly a year now, having moved from Cape Town, South Africa. In essence, I am wondering whether the water is safe to swim in from a pollution point of view. Obviously not the disgusting, green and murky water but some of the more free flowing or fresh lake water.

I absolutely love trail running and being outdoors but stay relatively far from the ""mountains"" here so have been road running quite a bit. As the weather is extremely hot now, I have also been wanting to go for swims after finishing runs along the river near Nanmen in Gusu. I have seen some older folks doing swimming practice in the river and it looks super nice, however there are tonnes of no swimming signs and I am worried about the water quality. I went with my girlfriend to Dushu lake yesterday and have also been on runs along Taihu lately. I know that many Chinese are afraid of drowning (?) and this may be the reason for the no swimming signs, but I am curious as to if the water quality is safe to swim in or if I will be on an extended trip to the bathroom afterwards.

But then she started treating my kids like they were a nuisance. They’re toddlers, okay? Loud, messy, clingy because they’re kids. Not demons. Not delinquents. Just regular tiny humans who watch Cocomelon and scream over crackers. At first, she’d just make these comments. “Oh, your boys are… active today.” “Wow, still crying?” “Do they ever nap?” Passive aggressive crap. Whatever. I ignored it. Pick your battles, right? Then came the yelling. One day I walked into the kitchen and heard her straight up screaming at my 4 year old because he spilled juice on the floor. Like, full on angry adult yelling. Red face. Finger pointing. My son just stood there frozen. Eyes wide. Silent tears. You know that kind of cry that doesn’t even make noise yet? Yeah. I lost it. I told her, right there, in front of everyone: “Do not yell at my children like that again. They’re not yours. You don’t discipline them. You’re scaring them.” And she LOST it back. Said I was disrespecting her in her house. That if I was such a great mom, my kids would know how to behave. That she “only raised her voice” because she didn’t want them growing up spoiled. Now my husband’s caught in the middle. Says she’s “old school” and “means well” and I “could’ve handled it better.” I said if she screams at them again, we’re leaving. Period. 

I won’t have my kids developing trauma because some bitter lady wants to relive her power trip phase. But now everyone’s saying I overreacted. That I embarrassed her. That I’m making things harder for everyone. I mean… I get it. It’s her space. But these are my kids. They’re not punching walls or burning the place down. They’re literally just existing.

1lnzh03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1lnzh03/struggling_with_resentment_after_my_husband_didnt/,Struggling with resentment after my husband didn’t step up during my hardest time,"I’m not sure what to do or how to pull myself out of this. I love my husband very much. We’ve been together for 6 years, married for 1. We have a 4 year old daughter and we have a great life together.

Recently I injured my knee pretty badly playing sport (November 24) and had surgery at the end of January. It was an ACL reconstruction with lateral meniscus repair. I was unable to weight bear for 6 weeks and as an active person and mother, this was an extremely difficult time for me. I’m a nurse, so I like to care for others, but generally don’t like to be cared for myself.

Well, this surgery was the exception to that rule. I was feeling the lowest and most depressed I’ve ever felt. The pain, the inability to complete normal tasks, the inability to play with my daughter. It was all really hard for me. I really wanted to be looked after and cared for by the person I love.

During this time I really realised how much I do around the house. The house became quite messy, and I found my husband just had absolutely no natural ability to care for others. He didn’t do anything for me unless I asked, and I would always get some smart arse comment about having to do it. Like he thought it was funny making a joke of everything I asked him to do for me. Getting my ice pack, filling up my water bottle, making me a coffee would get me a “ugh, again?” Or, “can’t you get it yourself?” He’d always do it, but the sarcasm and attitude made me not want to even ask.

In the end I just wouldn’t ask for help or I would just struggle to try and do it myself. I started having protein shakes for lunch just so I didn’t have to ask him for help carrying it to the table. One day I struggled even getting that to the table and while he was watching me struggled and I dropped it and my shake went all of the floor. I just broke down at this point because I just felt so alone. I’m a very open person, so I was voicing how I felt to him and opening up, but it made no difference.

It’s been almost 5 months and things are just about back to normal (except my ability to participate in sports). However, I still feel resentment toward him. I don’t feel that strong love that I felt for him before. It really hurt that he didn’t just want to care for me because he loves me. It made me wonder what would happen if it was something more permanent. Would I just be in a constant state of not feeling cared for? 

The last 2 weeks I’ve noticed he’s been really extra loving and emotional about how much he loves me. I’m wondering if he’s noticed I’ve checked out a bit. Any advice? I don’t know how to move past this. He’s not a great communicator, so whenever I try to talk to him about anything that’s upsetting me he gets on the defensive and then gives me the silent treatment. He won’t have an adult discussion about it. Often he’ll walk off and just do random tasks in the shed or yard.",3,1751261123.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

I’m (20TM) having some very conflicted thoughts. I live alone with my three dogs in my mom’s house I’ve lived in since I was little. I take care of the house, the dogs, work at a local coffee shop, and go to community college. My mom pays the bills while she is working a temporary job in California. I live in a smallish town in Illinois. About a week or two ago, my mother told me that she was thinking of taking a permanent job at the place she works at and living there. She wants me to live there with our three dogs and uproot our entire life and move. She tells me every time she calls I’ll love it since the area is much more accepting of LGBTQ+ individuals compared to the town I live in along with her best friend. I’ve been questioning our relationship, and I have been for a while. During my senior year of high school, she became a bit of an absent parent. She would be gone entire nights drinking with her best friend and be up all night partying at home with her and blasting music. I never got to have the things most seniors have with their parents such as professional senior photos and a graduation party. I was so confused on my future and she was hardly around to help me with my indecisiveness. And for the past few of my birthdays, it’s always felt like she doesn’t care. A couple weeks after my eighteen birthday, I came home at like nine after musical practice and my mom and her best friend were in the kitchen with this new Australian Shepard puppy. He was adorable and his name is Sebastian. Taking care of him was a nightmare. My mother coddled him like crazy and she was at work until after six most days. So I had to come home immediately after school to clean feces and urine all around our house along with whatever he decided to chew up because she refused to crate train him or get him any training. He’s all chilled out now but I feel like the house is always disgusting no matter how much I clean it. I know I sound horrible but I resent him. I feel as though with this move, my mom wants me to just be her constant live-in dog sitter and housekeeper when I want to go to an actual university, study abroad, go to culinary school, and run my own cafe. But I feel like I can’t tell her anything because she’ll just make me feel bad. I can’t even get into everything she’s done the past couple of years.

It reminded me how hard it is to find *quiet*, thoughtfully designed cafés when you’re not from here — especially places where you can just read, journal, or take a breath without the buzz of a tourist hotspot.



So I started putting together a personal map of some of my favorite low-key cafés across the city:

☕️ A coffee bar inside a Japanese townhouse

📘 A spot with a “lychee” pour-over (yes, it’s real)

🌊 A hidden café by the sea that makes its own soft-serve

…and more.



These aren’t hyped-up chains or influencer places — just the kind of places I’d take a friend who’s into slower travel, good design, and the quiet side of Taipei.

1lnzan5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lnzan5,Do these furniture pieces work in this space?,"I'm moving into a condo unit and struggling to figure out how to furnish it.

I'm personally into traditional furniture pieces, but because the condo's design is more modern, I'm trying to figure out how to strike a compromise between my personal style vs the style of the unit.

I did some furniture browsing for the living/dining area over the weekend and have played around with some of my favorite finds in canva.

Photos 1-2 are two mood boards I created, the only difference being the coffee table. Bottom left corner is a rug I thought would tie in the pink accent chair to the rest of the decor. Top right is the swatch of the kitchen countertops.

Pages 3-5 are the photos of the area to give you an idea what I'm working with (these photos include professional staging, which has now been removed. The staging doesn't match the style I'm going for, but I plan to follow their floor layout).

Photos 6-7 are my attempts to visualize the pieces from my mood boards into the living room in canva. Note the sizes of the furniture are not to scale.

Notes:

- I intend to paint the honey oak cabinets some kind of white in the near future, so I'm not shopping with any intention for pieces to go with it.

- I couldn't figure out how to edit the carpet design into pics 6-7, so I left the grey carpet that the stager had used.

- I am thinking of buying black barstools, so I left the stager's choice in.

- I plan to buy a white leather sofa like the one shown in pics 4-7, but will find different pillows. This couch is the only piece I feel most attached to selecting so far.

My questions:

1. Are the coffee table styles I've included too traditional to fit the space?

2. Would a white or black coffee table work better? (If neither, what colour would you suggrst?)

3. Does the white wood dining set (in the top left of my mood boards) work with the rest of the space?

4. Should I get one or two accent chairs?

Okay, so this is a story I’ve never told anyone before because, honestly, no one believes me. But I swear on my dog’s Netflix account that this is 100% true. Buckle up.

It all started when I took my 2005 Toyota Corolla (named “Mildred”) to get an oil change. I roll into Mr. Lube, expecting a routine in-and-out situation. I’ve got a half-eaten Egg McMuffin, coffee that tastes like burnt ambition, and Spotify set to ""Cursed Sea Shanties"" (don’t judge me, it’s Monday).

As I'm pulling in, this guy named Jerry (tag says “Trainee” but his confidence says “I own three ferrets and a unicycle”) tells me to drive over the pit. I do. Everything seems fine. UNTIL—

I hear what can only be described as a wet slap from the trunk. Not like something fell. Like... something landed.

Jerry pauses. I pause. The sea shanty in the background hits a high note that sounds eerily like a scream.

""Did you bring seafood?"" he asks.

“No?” I reply, because who brings seafood to an oil change?

He looks at me. I look at him. Then my backseat moves.

Suddenly, a lobster—a literal, full-grown, possibly retired, angry-looking lobster—launches itself from under my backseat floor mat like it was waiting for the opportune moment to ruin my life.

Now I’m screaming. Jerry’s screaming. The lobster’s making noises I didn’t know lobsters could make. Its claws are out like it’s ready to pinch my sins away.

I get out of the car. Jerry runs to the breakroom yelling “LOBSTER PROTOCOL” which is a thing, apparently???

Another guy comes out. This guy has one of those utility belts with way too many tools. They call him Mr. Lube—not his real name, I hope, but who knows? He’s got the energy of someone who’s fought crustaceans before.

Mr. Lube pulls out a long metal stick, a pair of tongs, and what might’ve been holy water. He dives into the Corolla like he’s storming the beaches of Normandy. The lobster hisses (LITERALLY HISSES), and a full-on battle breaks out.

Claws flying. Fluids dripping. At one point, someone throws in a traffic cone for ""leverage.""

Finally, Mr. Lube emerges victorious, holding the lobster up like Simba in The Lion King. We all cheer. The sea shanty reaches a triumphant crescendo.

I ask how a lobster ended up in my backseat.

Mr. Lube wipes a claw mark off his cheek and says, “Sir, some questions are better left unanswered.”

He gives me a discount on the oil change. I drive home with the windows down and a lingering scent of shellfish trauma.

I checked my trunk later—just in case—and found a single, unopened Red Lobster biscuit in the spare tire compartment. I haven’t slept right since.

TL;DR: Took my Corolla to Mr. Lube. A lobster attacked. Mr. Lube is a warrior. I fear seafood now.

After discovering that Kason had been secretly seeing his mistress for three years and was planning to marry her, I decided to leave him and return home for an arranged marriage.

On the first day, I handed the engagement ring he had given me to his mistress.

On the second day, I discarded everything that reminded me of him.

Kason scoffed, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.

I poured out the coffee I had made for Kason and left.

Kason had always kissed me with such care, so I had never seen him so passionate before.

Now I knew it was because he had given that side of himself to someone else.

Bitterthorn: It’s a fantasy book with a kinda enemies to lovers romance but that mainly focuses on the concept of loneliness and how we can actually enforce it on ourselves.

1lnz1uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1lnz1uw/ive_been_getting_weird_postcards/,I've been getting weird postcards,"It started simple. Most things do.

I woke up one morning and felt like taking a risk with my usual routine. I cooked my own breakfast—which I never do. I tried to make my mother’s scrambled eggs. Went better than expected: chewy bacon, toast the darker side of brown, and milkier-than-I-wanted-them eggs. I wrapped everything in a tortilla and left for work.

I checked my mailbox on the way out. I wanted to flip through it quickly—I could feel the sweet juices dripping down my wrist. Bills. Ads. A postcard?

The picture on the front was a bird’s-eye view of the city I lived in. I’ve seen those everywhere.

It was addressed to me. The sender’s space also had my name.

I laughed, thinking the writer made a mistake.

The message said:

Don’t Eat That.

There wasn’t a signature. Must have been a targeted ad or something. I tossed it in my bag with the rest and continued on my way.

An hour or so after my burrito met its inevitable demise, I started to feel funny. Queasy. Dizzy. Weak in the bowels.

I messed myself before I could make it home. But I remember thinking during my shower how I wished I’d thrown that burrito away. I remembered the postcard and examined it again. All the details were the same. It even looked like my handwriting.

I summed it up as one of those little coincidences life throws at you.

I wanted to remind my future self how awful today was—to make tomorrow something special. To make sure I’d actually see it again, I put the postcard back in my mailbox.

The next day, I felt less adventurous and craved my usual coffee order. Running late, I dashed downstairs to grab my mail on the way out and stashed it in my bag.

I barely made the bus. Going through my bills, I saw the postcard again.

Today wasn’t off to a much better start, but I was optimistic to see how things turned out. I smiled at the picture of my city and turned it around, looking at the handwriting with fresh eyes.

The message had changed.

Don’t go into the coffee shop.

I checked my mail stack again. This had to be a new one. Someone must’ve taken the old postcard. I figured I’d get it back soon. That made sense. Mostly.

Though it was still in my handwriting.

My favorite coffee shop was at my stop. I just stood there as the bus drove away. Staring at the shop. Reading the postcard again.

I felt silly. This was my life. Postcard ads weren’t going to stop me from living it.

Deciding my minute of hesitation was a waste of time, I was about to take my first step toward the shop.

I glanced up and caught eyes with my favorite barista, who gave me a warm wave—

—when the man she was helping in line lifted a gun and shot her in the face.

Poornami / 6:20 / Flesh eating meditation:

The initiation took place at of the July full moon in at the conclusion of a 7 day program wherein the shakti chalana kriya and shoonya meditation had been taught. I believe it was Columbus, but, maybe it was Dayton. I’m pretty sure it was Columbus.

There was a meeting that afternoon before the night of the initiation, for everyone who wanted to take the initiation. Nothing was said about what the initiation involved or what would be required afterward, if anything. It was typical isha ambiguity. During the meeting jaggi (Sadhguru) warned us that if we took drugs or drank alcohol or lied, for any reasons, or engaged in other similar kinds of behavior that we should not take the initiation because it might very well destroy us. Some people left at this point. For those that stayed and were still interested in taking the initiation we were given a number / tag or something similar before we left. If we didn’t take it when we left then we would not be allowed to be initiated that evening. If we took the token it held a place for us but did not obligate us to take the initiation.

I took the token / number and went back to my hotel. In preparation for the initiation we were told to take a shower shortly before the initiation, I think it was about a half hour, and leave our hair wet when we arrived back. Women were told not to wear a bra because the metal would interfere with the energy.

We gathered again that evening around . I think there were about 100 or more of us. I did sukha pranayam for about 1/2 hour - 45 minutes, per instructions, waiting for the initiation to begin. Jaggi came out and immediately many people went into their stuff – wailing, crying, laughing, etc.

He gave instructions for us to sit cross legged and for women to put their open left hand on their left thigh, palm up and put their open right hand on their upper abdomen with the top of their right thumb touching the soft spot just below the sternum (jaggi refers to this spot as anahata chakra). Men were instructed to do just the opposite – put their right open right hand on their right thigh palm up and their left hand on the abdomen with the tip of the thumb touching the soft spot below the sternum.

Then we were told to take in short quick breaths through our slightly open mouth, like sipping coffee or a drink and then chew the air we sipped into our mouths and then swallow. When we sipped the air into our mouths we were to imagine that we were taking jaggi’s flesh into our mouths and chewing it. We were to imagine that it was his actual flesh that we were chewing and swallowing. When he gave those instructions everyone went wild. It was at least as crazy as a samyama, maybe more so.

So, we did this sipping and chewing and swallowing of his flesh for sometime during the initation. Then at the end jaggi told us that we had to do this practice every day at 6:20 a.m. without fail. Practice Instructions were to begin the process at 6:20 with 3 minutes of sukha pranayam and then do the sipping, chewing and swallowing of jaggi's flesh for approximately 7- 10 minutes. We were now part of him and he part of us and this would greatly accelerate our spiritual progress.

Weird, huh?

1lnyzx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1lnyzx0/how_to_deal_with_my_straight_bestfriendcoworker/,How to deal with my straight bestfriend/coworker (senior leader in the company) who pushed me to have sex with him before reporting,"I need help. Or at least someone to talk to. My friend from work who I was very very close with invited me to stay with him on vacation. He's straight identifying, has a wife and kids, and a very senior leader known globally in the industry. 6 yrs older than me. Powerful guy and well loved by many.

So we were under influence, and I was groggy already, he was starting all these conversations saying if he makes me feel sexually harassed when he makes sexual jokes or jokingly touches my butt etc. He was ny best friend and I never took it seriously before and for me, it was just rough joking. So I said no, and that Im glad to just have a nonjudgemental straight friend. To be clear, I have not ever shown him any inidcation Im interested him in a sexual or romatic way. I dont even reply to his jokes. Im very careful with that.

He insisted many times to lie beside him. Long story short he lied beside me and made me do stuff. I was always hesitant but he was persistent. I knew I should have walked out (but I was in no condition) or pretended to be asleep or what. I was just panicking and I thought maybe if I do this then it will be over and everything is back to normal. He also knows Im asexual. I dont really like sex, so thats another layer.

First it was awkward during the trip but we were talking a bit. So I thought okay he just needs time. Back in the office I was staying away, but tried to break the ice by inviting him for coffee. He replied but declined. 

A couple of days passed it changed to downright ignoring me. And that really made an impact to me because thats when I felt that this would not be addressed.

At first all I wanted was to talk so I can process it. Maybe get an apology. Be assured that work wont get affected and I am safe. Im not asking much. Also since we have been though a lot, I was worried about him, that maybe he has a lot to unpack and he needs to address it. Im looking for that reassurance that he's not as malicious, that it prob was just a lapse in judgement, that he isnt a predator that planned this, and that we can fix it and get the help we need.

I tried to talk to him but he shut me down. He said ""Nothing to talk about and you need to give me more time."" And ""Dont tell anyone."" I felt used and discarded. Like it felt he only cared about himself, his own process, and not even check for me a bit when I was just dragged into this. That it was unfair to decide ""theres nothing to talk about"" when there is another person affected. 

Before, his consistent avoidance made me more anxious by the day. But that refusal to talk really made me spiral down. It's like I dont know him anymore and Im always worried what will happen next. I cant eat, I have trouble breathing. Everyone sees me being very upset but he goes around smiling and laughing and it triggers me. I dread work specifically projects where we might cross paths, which are very many. Been seeing a therapist everyday because Im getting panic attacks.

After he said those ""Dont tell anyone"" and ""theres nothing to talk about"", I got so mad and called him out with a long message. All I said was asking to talk and how this affects me. I did mention though he initiated many times so at least it is documented. Which he also ignored. Im worried he would make me seem unstable. 

I also feel guilty he has a family, which he keeps posting. Father of the year. I also feel guilty that maybe the night after, I should have talked to him, assure him that if he just explains and acknowledges then we dont hsve to make it a big deal. I think he is going through something and maybe if I didnt stay away on our frist day in the office, he would be more open. I also wanna be clear to him I have no romantic attachments at all. Maybe thats why he is so avoidant.

Right now I dont know what to do. Yes, I should file a complaint. But with my headspace now, I just wanna be better. Thats why I wanted to talk. I dont wanna blow this up and drag this. I wanna just get back to normal health and be heard and hear him out.

 But at the same time, if I dont do it soon, it might not be taken seriously. Worse I will be the bad guy. A gay guy subordinate vs a family man boss doesnt exactly sound like an underdog story many would root for. I even told a friend outside work and he just said ""it's like a gay movie, kinda beauitful. Turn it into one."" Another friend told me ""why not just be f*ck buddies."" Ugh.

I dont know the middle ground? Can I tell a friend at work i trust so at least someone knows in case? But we are in the same circle, with the same friends. 

Can I just document this but not make a case? Because as far as I know if I raise it to HR they will automatically act on it and hell will break loose and Im not sure if I can handle it. I dont want him to be fired because he has a family but I want him to have some accountability. Maybe apologize and get help he needs. I cant think much anymore. And am in shock since this guy has been so kind to me and I looked up to him, he was a great mentor, and never expected this at all.

My next step is stay away for now. Maybe tjis is ewting him up inside too regardless of how he fronts he is ok. Then I will ask him one more time to talk. Give him a timeline if he wont give me one. If he still brushes what happened as nothing, I have to make this an official complaint especially now it makes me think there were other victims too or will be. BUt I dont really want to. It will cause me so much distress and affect the entire team and even the company and our families. If only he would just apologize I would be fine.

Italy has a 9.8% obesity rate (Offficial figures in Italian - just use your browser to translate: https://www.epicentro.iss.it/obesita/epidemiologia-italia), France 15%. 

The reason why people (overall) are skinnier over here, is that people usually have three square meals a day and little to nothing in between, the food they eat is usually either home-made (even just boiling water for some pasta and adding oil and garlic to it) or from a company cafeteria, we walk a lot more, and that there is HUGE societal pressure to be thin. People restrict their caloric intake constantly. Also, coffee usually means an espresso, drunk black (or with a dollop of milk in it).

You do not want to be the fat person sticking out in France or Italy; and by that I do not mean being a tourist visiting, but living there and being fat you will not have fun.

Sure, breakfast in Italy is usually very sweet, but people will have ONE cornetto (or some biscuits if they eat at home...) and one coffee/cappuccino and that's it until lunch.",140,1751258848.0,loseit,47,0.88,False

1lnyp7j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lnyp7j,Shout out to Syriac owned Georgias Press LLC first illustrated introduction to the unique collections of Cairo Genizah manuscripts at Cambridge University Library. God willing this can be done with Damascus fragments too,"Almost one thousand years ago, the Jews of Old Cairo began to place their worn-out books and scrolls into a hidden storage room – a genizah – of their synagogue. Over the years, they added all sorts of writings to the pile, sacred and secular texts alike. When the chamber was emptied at the end of the 19th century, it held hundreds of thousands of paper and parchment fragments. Now known as the ‘Cairo Genizah’, it has become one of the most important sources of knowledge for the history of the Middle East and the Mediterranean world. This book offers the first illustrated introduction to the unique collections of Cairo Genizah manuscripts at Cambridge University Library.

Join Genizah experts Nick Posegay and Melonie Schmierer-Lee as they take you on a journey of discovery through more than 125 years of research at the University of Cambridge, showcasing over 300 stunning, full-colour manuscript images across 12 thematic chapters. From ancient Bibles to medieval magic and Renaissance printing presses, The Illustrated Cairo Genizah reveals the forgotten stories of Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities at the centre of a millennium of world history.

#Endorsements

“This book is a superb overview of the rich diversity of the contents of the Cairo Genizah. It is inspiring for all, specialists and non-specialists, by the attractiveness of its production with superb colour images and the clarity of the learned comments on the manuscripts.”

--Geoffrey Khan, Regius Professor of Hebrew, University of Cambridge

“People in my line of work have been waiting their whole careers for a Genizah coffee table book, and it has finally arrived. Marvels await you. A single, all but vanished group of Jews survives in the world’s imagination because they left an extraordinary number of written traces. If you want to know more about them, this is the book for you. If you want to know why anyone would devote themselves to studying ancient, tattered, dusty and often illegible manuscript fragments, this book will not just tell you but show you with copious images. If you already know the manuscripts and the history and the community they document, you’ll still be humbled by the commitment of the librarians, conservators and scholars whose labor has made them legible for the future.

uring his consular service, Edward Thomas Rogers (1831–84) became a spirited traveller, diplomat and collector. In Syria he caused a scandal when he opened the Qubbat al-Khazna at the ancient Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and came into possession of some precious ancient manuscripts that had been consigned there. The most sensational among these was a fragment of the Greek New Testament. The incident followed hot on the heels of Tischendorf’s discovery of Codex Sinaiticus in 1844, and came to the attention of European manuscript hunters, including ultimately the German Professor Hermann von Soden (1852–1914). Von Soden had been working on a new edition of the Greek New Testament in Berlin and, endowed by a patron with the right means, he set out to gather new sources for textual criticism. In feverish excitement, von Soden imagined discoveries in the Qubba that could rival all others. As Schechter would unearth the great riches of the Cairo Genizah some years afterwards, scholars later deemed it appropriate to use the term “genizah” for the newly discovered Damascus hoard.

 

umayyad mosque-dome of the treasury

 

The Qubbat al-Khazna—the “Treasury Dome”— is located in the courtyard of the Umayyad Mosque. It still stands there today, on eight Roman columns, an octagonal structure decorated with mosaics. There, in a chamber with a diameter of approximately six and a half metres, protected from harm by a heavily locked iron door, and only reachable with the help of a ladder, a pile of manuscripts—as high as one man standing upright—had found its final rest. The chamber mostly held old Qurans and literary manuscripts, but there were also Hajj certificates and documents pertaining to everyday life, such as marriage and divorce contracts, and various other kinds of deeds. 


The fragments had originally been placed there, together with other “worn-out” manuscripts, following the usual practice of storing away sacred books and important documents that were too fragile to remain in circulation or which had fallen out of use. They were not intended for subsequent retrieval or to form an archive, but the practice was rather a ritualized burial resulting from an esteem for, or a fear of desecration of, the written word. Muslims, Jews, and Christians shared this practice.  

On von Soden’s initiative, the German emperor and Prussian king Wilhelm II urged the Sublime Porte by diplomatic means to allow a scholar to go through the material and study it thoroughly. Wilhelm II had only just returned from an historic visit to the Holy Land, where he and his consort, Augusta Victoria, were shown the Umayyad Mosque and the Qubba. This visit had strengthened the alliance between Prussia and the Ottoman Empire. Permission for a further study of the contents of the qubba was granted by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II in the form of an irāda. The irāda also instructed Wali Nazim Pasha, governor of Damascus, to carry out and oversee the opening of the Qubba. Funding for the expedition was secured, and a young German scholar, Bruno Violet, was chosen to undertake it. He arrived in Damascus on May 30 1900 and commenced his task.

Simple rules were set down by the mosque’s authorities: the Prussian gentleman could consult all fragments except those of Muslim provenance. He recounts that Muslim fragments—mostly Quranic fragments, Hajj certificates and legal documents—were immediately taken away from him and stored in sacks. The remaining, non-Muslim, fragments were cleaned, pressed, and conserved by the modest means available to Violet. Some of them he also photographed.[1] After about a year, his work approached completion; it had increasingly caused suspicion and dismay among locals. Hastily, he photographed a selection of fragments before he departed for Berlin on July 2 1901.

Another irāda of Abdul Hamid II gave permission for the collection to be sent to Berlin on loan. Before the fragments were dispatched, however, the whole batch was inventoried and photographed by the Ottoman authorities. The number of fragments at this time was given as 1558.  

#The collection arrived in Berlin on June 17, 1902, and was deposited at the Royal Museums; in 1904, it was moved to the State Library. It consisted mainly of Jewish, Christian, and Samaritan texts, in a variety of scripts and languages: Greek, Hebrew, Samaritan, Latin, Coptic, Syriac, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, and even Armenian. 


#Among the fragments, many were palimpsests or had been re-used as the bindings of books. Unexpectedly after six years, in December 1908, the Ottomans demanded the return of the fragments. A prioritized list of 54 fragments, prepared by von Soden, and an almost complete Syriac codex was all that could be photographed before the collection was sent back in its entirety


.[2] The Ottomans confirmed that the collection reached Istanbul; however, its current whereabouts remain a matter of conjecture since then.

Violet’s collection consists of a small though significant fraction of the Damascus Genizah. The larger part, which amounted to perhaps 99.5% of the Qubba’s contents, was transferred to Istanbul. The majority of the fragments were housed eventually at the Türk ve İslam Eserleri Müzesi, the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, where the collection was called şâm evrakları “Damascus papers”. An inventory made in 1955 numbers 13,882 items, with a total of 211,603 pieces.

This is the first volume aimed at placing the enormous set of fragments from the Qubbat al-khazna on the map of Middle Eastern history as a corpus. As much as its famous sibling, the Geniza of Cairo, the Qubba was ‘discovered’ in the 19th century, but its over 200,000 fragments have remained on the margins of scholarship so far. An international and interdisciplinary team of scholars has now come together to sketch the fascinating history of this collection and to map the extraordinarily varied multilingual, multireligious and multiscriptural written artefacts it contains. This book is essential reading for those interested in manuscript studies as well as in philology and Middle Eastern history.

I’m usually able to keep myself together during hard times, but with my sister’s funeral yesterday, I couldn’t help but to lock myself in my room and ball my eyes into my pillow. It was 10:32 PM, A drunk driver took a left as my sister, Hannah, was driving through a green light. The driver was too hammered to realize that she was approaching quickly, but he went anyway. She was going 75 MPH, until it rapidly fell to zero when her body went through the windshield and crashed into the drunk’s car. The dark red hue of her blood completely filled the right side of the drunk’s white van. If that driver wasn’t driving under the influence, or if Hannah was wearing her seatbelt, none of this would’ve happened. I know she wasn’t wearing one, because I was in the passenger seat that night.

I felt so guilty. I didn’t know she wasn’t wearing it. Maybe if I told her to put it on, things could’ve been different. Blaming the driver makes the situation easier though. His name was Bryce Mollere, he’s serving eight years in prison. If I could, I would plead for public execution, never let him drink, drive, or do anything again. But, America and democracy has its morals or whatever.

I’ve been in my room since last night, and haven't eaten anything since the granola bar I stashed in my pocket before the funeral. I haven’t checked on my dad to see how he’s doing, we didn’t talk the whole car ride home. First it was my mom three years ago, and now my sister. I lifted my head off my pillow to see a pool of tears I left in my breakdown. I wiped my face with my shirt as I stood up weakly. I could still feel the airbag bashing my chest in with such force that it left a massive bruise. It hurts to use my arms or try to move in certain ways.

The room was a mess. T-shirts and shorts thrown around the place and unpaired socks all over the floor. I ignored them and headed for the door. It creaked loudly as I opened it slowly. I could hear slight whimpering coming from downstairs. Halfway down the stairs, I see my dad sitting on the couch, head in hands, as he quietly wept into them. I guess nothing in this house is quiet, because he must’ve heard the wooden stairs creak and looked up from his hands.

“Oh,” he said as he wiped his tears. “Sorry, I didn’t see you.”

“It’s okay.”

I came down the rest of the stairs and sat across from him in the living room. We sat there in silence for what seemed like lifetimes.

“I’m sorry you have to go through this, son.” I stayed quiet, looking down at my feet. “This wasn’t supposed to happen to you, to us. You’re just a kid.” 

Another tear rolled down his cheek as I looked up at him. I felt more tears starting to form.

“I just don’t know what to do,” I pleaded. “What can we do?” 

The silence was deafening. I didn’t expect him to answer. We’ll just have to do what we’ve been doing for the past three years; ‘fake it until we make it’. But that’s bullshit, because there is no ‘making it,’ so we’ll be faking it for the rest of our lives. After the excruciatingly long pause, my dad spoke up.

“What do you think about moving?” 

The question caught me off guard. It made me think about how run-down the place was: the doors nearly coming off the hinges, the floors and stairs feeling like they’ll cave in any second. We didn’t have a washer or dryer, we didn’t even have an oven. It would be nice to be somewhere new, especially since I’ve lived in this same house since I was born. But where was my dad going to get the money for a new house? He works off of minimum wage helping at construction sites. As if he heard my thoughts, he answered.

“I got a job offer from a delivery service, semi-truck driving. It’s a lot higher paying than what I’m working for. Problem is, it’s a couple hours down south in a town called Old Ridge. I found a decent house, better than this one. I’ll be able to pay for it, don’t worry.” 

It sounded appealing. I just felt bad that he had to handle the expenses on his own. 

“Are you sure you can pay for it? Maybe I can find a job down there, help with some of the bills.”

“Thanks buddy,” 

He gave me a weak smile as he got up from the couch. He walked over to me holding his arms out, signaling a hug. My heart melted, along with the rest of my body as he held me in his arms. I tried to hold back my tears, but it was just too much. I gasped and struggled for air as tears rolled down my cheeks. I could hear his heartbeat as my head rested on his chest.

“I’m so sorry you have to go through this, no kid should have to.” 

He hugged me tighter as I sobbed. Every time I close my eyes, I can see that night, clear as day. The graphic memory of my sister barreling through the windshield. Her limbs mangled in ways I didn’t think I’d ever see outside of dark web videos online. I would never be able to erase it from my memory as it haunts me every night.

“I don’t know if I can do this, dad,” I said shakily as I wiped my tears. 

The weight of both the women in my life suddenly gone was just too heavy, knowing I'll never be the same again. It was probably worse for dad, losing his wife and his own child.

“It’s… it’s gonna be alright,” I could hear the uncertainty in his voice. “We’ll get through this together.” 

I hoped we would be able to recover, but if we couldn’t, at least we would be miserable together.

“So, would you be okay with moving?”

“Yeah.”

“Are you sure? I can give you some time to think about it-“

“No, it’s okay. I’m fine with it.” 

I looked up at him with a genuine smile. If my dad can get a higher paying job and we can live somewhere more secure, then that’s fine by me. 

“Okay then. I’ll accept the job and we can leave in a couple days.”

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I had everything I needed for the new house packed into 3 different boxes: One for all of my clothes (I really only had 7 different outfits that I owned), one for my 2010 personal computer and all the parts it needed, and the last one for any random accessories or toys that I had.

I peeked in my sister’s room, which was mostly empty. The night before, my dad and I put her stuff into a couple boxes. We kept a couple of her things for memorabilia, but most of her clothes and other items were either given to charity, or sold to whoever would take them. One thing we kept was a necklace she would always wear. It was a necklace I gave her on her twentieth birthday. I got it from a generic jewelry store, but she loved it and wore it almost every day. It was mostly silver, while the charm was a golden heart. On the back of the heart, it said, ‘I love you forever.’ Before my mom died, I would do chores around the house for allowance. I used all the money I made from this to get her that necklace. She was wearing it on the day of the crash. Before she was taken to the hospital, a police officer came up to me, holding the necklace. He asked me if I was related to Hannah, and when I confirmed, he gave me the necklace to keep. I started wearing it everyday after he gave it to me; Just something to keep that has a little part of her everywhere I go.

I checked my dad’s room, he was crouching down in front of one of the cardboard boxes, putting piles of clothes into it. He heard me approaching with the creaking of the floorboards and looked behind him. He gave me a smile and stood up.

“You ready to go, bud?” 

I traded smiles with him and nodded. He saw Hannah’s necklace I was wearing and his smile faded a little. His eyes were suddenly filled with sorrow, and I reciprocated.

“Yeah I got packed pretty quick, don’t have much to pack anyway.”

“Alright, we can leave here pretty soon. I just gotta finish cleaning up before we go.”

“I can help.”

“Thanks, I gotta finish packing, but if you want to start without me, you can put the tupperware and utensils in a box downstairs.”

I started down the stairs that sounded like they were about to collapse and found a box to put the tupperware in. I headed to the kitchen and opened the silverware drawer. I don’t know exactly why, but I guess out of boredom, I started counting each individual fork, spoon, and butter knife,

One, two, three, four, five… six forks.

One, two, three, four… five spoons.

One, two… three butter knives.

I never realized that we had one less spoon compared to forks. Maybe someone accidentally threw one in the trash along with their paper plate. Speaking of, we didn’t have glass plates or anything like that, so I didn’t have to worry about counting those. We do have some glass cups, though.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven… eight glass cups.

One… two glass coffee mugs.

I made sure to put these in carefully so they wouldn’t break on the transport to our new house. The box was about halfway full, and all I needed to pack now was the plastic tupperware. I didn’t even bother to count these because there were so many plastic shapes and sizes that I wouldn’t even know how to classify them, so I just tossed them all in the box. There were a couple containers with lids, some big containers with no lids, and other classifications I didn’t bother to check. I was about to seal up this box with tape when my dad came down the stairs with his first round of boxes.

“Do you need any help moving those?”

“Nah, nah, it’s all good, I got it.” 

He sounded like he was about to pass out, but I wasn’t about to ruin his manhood, so I watched him struggle to place the boxes at the bottom of the stairs with a bit of a thud. He wiped his forehead and heavily exhaled.

“Whew, didn’t think I had that much stuff either, but I still got three boxes upstairs.” 

He stretched out his back and I could hear the multiple cracks throughout his spine. He searched through his back pocket and held out his car keys to me. 

“Do you mind putting some of these boxes in the trunk for me?” 

I grabbed them and nodded. He started his way back upstairs as I unlocked and opened the front door. I struggled to pick up the first big box, but managed to bring it to the back of my dad’s SUV. I put it on the concrete driveway and reached into my pocket. I unlocked the car and swung open the trunk. Hopefully there was enough room for all of our boxes. I thought it wouldn’t be too bad, though; we can cram some other boxes and items in the backseat as well. I lifted the box up and carefully slid it in the back of the trunk, touching the backseats. I walked back inside for more boxes when I see my dad coming down the stairs with another one.

“Hey, grab this one for me, will ya?”

I took it from his hands, it was lighter than the one I took outside previously.

“I put all the forks and stuff in that box in the kitchen if you want to look at it before taping it up.”

He went to the kitchen as I headed outside with the box he handed to me. The trunk was still open, so I placed the box into the trunk, putting it right next to the previous box. I wiped the sweat off my forehead with my sleeve. I heard a door open and close to my right. I thought it might have been my dad coming outside, but instead, it was our next door neighbor. We both exchanged looks as he headed over in my direction.

“Hey, Sonny! Whatcha doin‘ with those boxes?”

The man was old, about 80 years old, but we never really talked all that much, and I couldn’t remember his name. All I know is that he and my dad would go out golfing a few times before. But ever since mom passed, we stayed reclusive when it came to neighbors.

“Hey! We’re actually, um, moving away.”

It was a pretty awkward exchange. He just stood there after the fact, with the same oddly big smile on his face.

“Oh, well that’s a shame. Where ya headed?”

“My dad got a job in Old Ridge, a few hours south of here?”

The man’s demeanor immediately changed from cheery to blank-faced. His smile faded faster than anything I’ve seen before. The color from his eyes vanished into nothingness.

“…Old Ridge..?”

His monotone voice gave me the creeps. I instinctively took a step back. What was it about Old Ridge that set this old guy off? I assumed that maybe he used to live there, or maybe passed through before.

“Y-Yeah, do you know the place?”

He didn’t answer. His face didn’t change, he didn’t even move. It was as if he was in a trance, and the phrase that triggered it was ‘Old Ridge’. I looked to my left and saw my dad coming out the door with the box of tupperware I packed, now taped and sealed up. He peeked around the box to see the man and smiled.

“Hey Bill! It’s been a while!”

I stepped out of the way as my dad put the box in the trunk. Bill still seemed to be his frozen state, but he quickly snapped out of it when my dad spoke to him.

“Hey Jim! So you’re moving to Old Ridge, huh?”

“That’s right, did my son tell you?”

”Yup! He also told me you got a job down there. That’s great!” His big smile was back and his tone shifted back to how it was originally. It was like he was two different people.

“Yeah, we’re excited. Nice to have some change, y’know?”

“Oh, I know it all too well…” Bill took a long pause. “...I’m sorry about your daughter’s passing recently.”

“Thanks.” 

I could tell my dad wanted nothing to do with this conversation, and neither did I. I remember seeing Bill at the funeral; it was just for a moment, but he was standing in the corner after the ceremony. Not interacting with anyone, just looking down at the ground, or staring off into space somewhere. I never trusted this man, I don’t know if it’s just because he’s old and frail, or something about his vibe just doesn’t sit right with me. Another long pause was broken by Bill when he started again.

“Alright well, you two best get back to it! I wouldn’t want to keep you!”

Dad and I were heading back inside, but before we reached the door, the man chimed in another time, with his same happy demeanor.

“Best of luck in Old Ridge! My son lives there, that place is not what it seems!” Bill chuckled, but the statement didn’t seem funny at all. “Buh-bye now!”

He waved us goodbye as we closed the door behind us. We both looked at each other, as puzzled as ever to his last addition. ‘Best of luck’? ‘Not what it seems’? I don’t know what he could possibly mean, but by the way he looked at me when I brought it up, it wasn’t anything good.

“What, a, weirdo.” He read my mind.

We brought out the rest of the boxes and were able to cram everything in the trunk, with a few things like bedding and such in the back seat. I slammed the trunk door shut and handed my dad’s keys back. I swung open the passenger side door and jumped in the SUV. I shut the door, reached in the back seat for a pillow and blanket, and got myself comfortable.

“I’m gonna do one more sweep of the house to make sure everything’s good, okay?” I gave him a nod as he went back inside. 

I breathed deeply and exhaled as I closed my eyes. My head was still wrapping around what Bill meant about this town we’re moving to. Is it really a good idea to do this? Well, I guess there’s no turning back now, this house has already been sold. 

I opened my eyes and looked out the passenger side window. My skin began to crawl as I looked at the side of Bill’s house. At his window was a silhouette of someone, staring at me. No, it wasn’t just someone, it was Bill. I squinted my eyes to see that he had a massive frown on his face, as if polar opposite from before. His hand was smudging the window as it was pressed against it firmly. My breathing became shaky, it became hard to breathe. It was like his presence was sucking the life out of me. I glanced to the front of my house as my dad came out the door and locked it behind him. My eyes quickly darted back to the man’s window, but the silhouette was gone. I could still faintly see the hand print he left on the window.

My dad opened the driver door and plopped himself next to me. He exhaled as he closed the door and started the engine. It took a little longer than expected to start up, but the car was persistent and the engine began to purr.

“Alright, you ready? Got a long trip ahead of us.”

“I guess so.”

He didn’t understand and rather than asking how to adjust the grinder size he rotated the zero marker around and ended up putting a pretty good scratch in the upper burr holder (not sure if thats actually what the part is called so please correct me if I’m wrong).

Has anyone else damaged their grinder like this and have you found a way to make it less noticeable? 

I really like the aesthetic of my coffee station and now the only thing I see when I look at it is the scratch.",2,1751257666.0,DF64,13,1.0,False

From the actual author, before reading this I would like to preface that this is my first real short story I’ve written out of creative writing class and I know it’s not exactly CreepCast material but I am proud of my baby. This story is actual apart of a collection of short stories I’m currently writing, an anthology if you, and is the first to leave the editing stage and make it to Final Cut. It honestly might need more editing but who the hell I might as well. Also, this story does include self-harm so to any reader: beware. (5563 words (it’s pretty fucking long.))

  

                 I Have Beautiful Skin 

Working late at an overnight gym was odd. You see a lot of odd people. On this particular night, there wasn’t a lot, any, in fact. There were maybe 14 or 16. Also several of my coworkers were scattered about. 

	Everything was normal tonight. Regulars were deep into their workouts, coworkers doing their work (at least, I hope) and I was sitting up here on my stool, playing games on my phone. 

Today though… someone different came in. Nothing wrong with that, he was just a little odd. I put my phone down on the counter as he came up, meeting me with his eyes. His skin was tattered with pimples, it was flaky, but somehow it looked so oily that it almost looked wet. His hair was no better. Stringy, shoulder-length, black, spaghetti hair that also looked dry at the end. His body was in total disarray. It disagreed with each other in every way. On top of what looked like his lack of hygiene, he was scrawny, with bone outlines showing in every direction. 

	Maybe I was so used to seeing the usual gym rats… I shouldn’t judge. He’s here to better himself…probably. 

	“I … bought a membership a while ago…” he shyly declared. Despite the little shaky undertone in his voice, it was actually a little smooth. Like listening to a meditation audio. 

	I looked into his eyes as he smiled. His eyes were a beautiful brown color, and his teeth were pure white and so straight. I mentally shook off my thoughts as I spoke. 

	“Do you still have your card?” I simply ask. 

	“I do,” he held up the slim membership card in his long bony hands. 

	“Just tap it there,” I placed a finger on the electronic reader and he hesitantly followed. As it beeped it showed his account: still active, and his picture. In it, he looked… confident… his skin looked clearer. It looked almost like he was a different person. “You’re good to go.” 

	He nodded at me as he went straight up the stairs to where all the equipment was. I sighed as I went back to my phone. 

	Hours passed, many left, and few entered, but my thoughts were still clouded by the strange-looking man as I continued to just sit there. I know I shouldn’t have been thinking about him so much but I just did… 

	It had been 5 hours since the man initially checked in… did I just miss when he left? As soon as I started to think more deeply about it, he came up to the counter, in different clothing and seemingly showered with his hair up in a bun. His hair might have appeared different but his skin and physique were still so off-putting. 

	He must have noticed me staring because his hand shot up to feel his acne-ridden cheek softly before his arm fell back to his side. 

	“You have nice skin,” he complimented. 

	“Oh no, I didn’t mean…” I sucked in a breath, realizing how rude I was being. 

	“It’s alright,” he did a slight nod as he continued. “Do I need to check out?” 

	“No… you can just walk right out.” 

	“Thank you,” he gave me a small smile as he started to walk away. 

	He stopped before he reached the door, putting his hand on the push-handle, and moving his head to look behind him to meet my eyes, “have a good rest of your night.”  

	I nodded, “You too…” I sort of quietly responded as he left. 



	 The rest of the shift was dull. Simple exchanges, playing games, mindlessly tapping on the counter, answering a call or two. 

	When my shift ended at four in the morning, I was exhausted walking to my car. I fumbled with my keys as I stepped to the side parking lot. The sky was still very dim. My jingling keys echoed in the air. I came up to my car as I heard another pair of footsteps. I stopped in front of my small car’s door and the footsteps also stopped. 

	I looked up and I saw a tall imposing figure with huge glowing eyes nearby. 

	“Fuck that, fuck that!” I whispered as I hurried into my car and started it.

 I’m not proud to admit it, but I disregarded many driving laws in leaving that parking lot but I made it back home safe. I pulled up in front of my apartment. One of my neighbors was out on her fenced-off porch as she smoked under a lamp. 

	“Oh look who’s home,” she held out the cigarette away from her mouth. 

	“Hi, Miss Daphne,” I locked up my car as I approached her. “What are you doing up so early?” I put my hand on her metal gate fence. 

	“Oh, y’know, the usual,” she took a big breath from her cigarette. “Got yourself a boyfriend yet?” 

	She always asked that question when I saw her. I don’t know why it mattered so much to her. 

	“Yeah, yeah, when pigs fly,” I responded as I started towards the cement stairs. 

	She took another puff, “It’ll happen one day, I know it. Prince Charming, beautiful smile, beautiful eyes. I see it in the night.” 

	Her final words caught me off-guard. She always self-proclaimed she was a psychic but I never believed it. She told me to get rid of the straightener I own. Stop lighting candles at night. Don’t leave your window open at night.  Find another job. Stupid stuff like that. I’ve had that straightener for years. I always blow out the candles before I sleep. I’m on the second story. And the job I have is perfectly fine and pays me well without me having to do too much. I know that she thinks she’s just looking out for me but it was just always odd words. I don’t think she ever knows what she’s talking about so I started my trek up the stairs. 

“Sure, Miss Daphne… good night.” 

“Of course, dear, good night.” 

Once I got inside my apartment, I stumbled in the dark to my bedroom. I didn’t need a boyfriend. I didn’t need to change whatsoever. What I needed was some sleep. I didn’t even get out of my uniform. I just plopped on the bed and drifted off. 
        
I usually dreamt in the night, but this time it was just darkness. Something was taking me over. It was odd. When I woke up at 3 pm, I realized how much I lost time. I usually wake up at 12, a nice start to my day. Eating breakfast, working out, and doing my skin and hair routine. I know it wasn’t that early but give me a break, I get out of work at 4 in the morning. 12 was perfectly accepted…. 3 however was not. It wasn’t like I did anything at 3 but it just disoriented me. How did I sleep for so long? 

I got up slower than usual. I think I would’ve sat in my bed for much longer but there was a banging on my door. It seemed urgent from how loud they were knocking. I stumbled through my apartment again, tripping over things I knew were there before reaching the door. As I opened it, Daphne pushed it open quickly. 

	“Siria, please, do not go to work today!” She screamed worriedly, a thick accent slipping through her voice. She grabbed me by the shoulder (I was wearing a tank top so I could feel her wrinkly fingers) and looked me in the eyes so fiercely, it felt like they were going to pop right out of her skull. 

	“Why…Why!?” I first asked groggily, like I was still half-asleep (because I was) and then the latter louder and more confused (because I was.) 

	“I see… in my dreams…” she let her grip go from my flesh as she looked down. 

	“Daphne! Enough of her dreams, nothing ever happens, nothing ever does!” 

	“No, child,” her eyes darted back to meet mine, her Russian accent now thick. “I see more clearly, no one will help you when …he… comes…” 

	“Who?” I questioned now fully awake and irritated. 

	“I … don’t know…” 

	I take her hands as I lead her out of my apartment. Once she was outside on my welcome mat, I spoke up again. “Your dreams lead nowhere…they’re just dreams. Maybe…maybe… you should get some help…” I finally say.

	Her face contorted into sorrow. The unmistakable curve of her brow and the frown on her lips. She left quickly down the cement stairs and I felt it useless to call after her. Instead, I just sighed. 

	I returned to the confines of my apartment. I felt tired again but resisted sleep. I made coffee, ate some avocado toast, and all that stuff I usually did. 

	I found myself increasingly tired, though, the coffee did jack shit and it just felt like I took a heavy dosage of melatonin without knowing it. I sat on the couch, turning on the TV and watching mindless hours of reality TV until I eventually succumbed to sleep…

	My alarm for work went off… I didn’t even realize I had fallen asleep (or snoozed my 4 other alarms) until I looked at the time. I shot up, getting ready as quickly as I could in my simple uniform. I threw my hair up, not wanting to take the time to do it as I left my apartment: purse and keys in hand. 

	As I ran down the cement stairs, I noticed Daphne wasn’t where she usually was around this time: sitting on her porch, smoking without a care in the world. In fact, all of her blinds were closed. Her lights were off. I shrugged it off. She must just be asleep… must be off routine like I was. 

	The drive to work was dull. The whole time I was dozing off and struggling to keep focus. It was almost like I just appeared in the parking lot when I became slightly awake. I rushed into the doors and towards the counter, about 20 minutes late, where one of my coworkers…my boss.. was sitting, filing her nails. 

	She looked up at me with a smile, “Oh, hey! Are you okay?”

I nodded and gave her a weary smile, I was still so tired… and Amy shot out of the mouth. She blabbered on and on and even pointed out things she should’ve kept her mouth shut on… God, why am I being so mean? I sat next to her and clocked in. 

“Why are you so late? I mean if it is personal then I won’t ask but seriously why are you late? I’m supposed to be in the back right now but Siria are you sure you’re okay? I mean you can tell me anything right? You know you can tell me anything right?” 

“Yeah no… great actually… just fell asleep…” 

“Y'know what they say, never take a small nap because you’ll end up oversleeping!” 
	
Yeah, that is a thing, but who the fuck says that? I couldn’t think straight but I know for a fact that’s not a saying. 

“Soooo then, what’s the deal? You okay?” 
	
“Yes! I am!” I tried to sound nice but it came out like I was yelling at a dog for shitting on the floor. 

“You look really tired.”

“Yeah, I am, I already told you.” 
	
“Your eye bags aren’t a great look for you, I have this greaaaat skin routine, it makes me so glowy and shiny, it's amazing!” She bragged. 
	
“No, thanks, I think your emails or Chase need you in the back,” I finally said to try to get rid of her. 

“Oh right,” she stood up, “let me know if you need anything, m’kay?” 

“Yeah…” I yawned as she walked to the backroom to join our other coworker. Chase was some guy in his mid-thirties, who worked at a pool? I think for 12 years and then suddenly switched jobs. He was quiet so I much rather would want him up here with me than Amy. I yawned again as I looked at the computer to see the people who checked in recently.

 I laid my head on the counter, waiting for someone to come in.
I must have waited for a long time because before I knew it… I was right asleep. I never fell asleep on the night shift. I never slept this much in a day. Period. Something was wrong. Very…wrong. 

I was awoken two hours later, Amy shaking my shoulders and calling out to me. I shot up, standing up straight. She stepped back a bit. 

“Siria… I think you should go home for the night. Not to be rude or anything but you have barely been here for two hours and you’re at the counter sleeping,” she crossed her arms. 

“No, I swear I can stay awake just… sorry, I don’t know why I’m so tired…” I trailed off. 

“It's okay if you need to take a day, and just rest or do something for yourself. I will not take no for an answer!” 

“Amy, please, I can do this-” 
“Go. Home. Before I make you take a week okay?” 

I nodded with a sigh. I grabbed my things. She took my place as I left the building. It was a little less than 10 at night and it was already pitch dark outside. I went to my car. No creepy person across from me. Maybe I was just imagining it the night before. I shrugged it off as I drove home… again dozing off every two seconds. 
	
When I got home… Daphne wasn’t there on her little porch chair. 

Once I got inside, I just wanted to collapse. When I went to my room, I just felt so relaxed… I laid in my bed and the cushions just felt so… soft… and ...plush…

I shot up. No! What the fuck!? Why am I so tired!? I huffed as I tried to distract my mind from sleep. I went over to my vanity. I lit an orange citrus candle that was already open on the desk. I looked in my mirror as I studied my tired eyes. As soon as the scent filled my nostrils I felt more awake. I took a deep breath, a few actually, before looking at myself again. I wasn’t usually like this. Maybe I should actually do something for myself. I plugged in my straightener and pulled out some of my makeup. 

Before I started, I went over to slightly open the window, just for a bit of fresh night air. I felt better. Much, much better. When I sat down, I put up pieces of my hair in metal clips. I straightened small areas as I hummed. 

Before I could finish half of it, I heard thumping on the side of the building. I didn’t think much of it until it continued. I put down the straighter as I went over to the window and opened it slightly more. There wasn’t a screen so I peeked out my body, looking down to see what was going on when I saw it. A large figure crawled up the side of my building up to my window. Big, yellow, glowing eyes. 
	
When I pulled my body back inside, I slightly hit my head on the window. I winced as I backed away from it, hoping I was just imagining it. It was a dream. Anything. That was until the figure reached up to the edge, gripping their fingers onto the ledge before pushing their body into my room. 

It was a man. Tall, long-haired, scrawny… it was him. It's the man from the day before. He looked different. His skin aged rapidly from then, wrinkles and leather-like patches tattered everywhere. His fingers elongated into sharp point-like claws stretching his skin out over thin bones. He stared at me then looked over to my vanity. 

“You should be asleep right now,” his voice was split into two layers. One that sounded like a scared little boy and the other, a domineering force. 

“What….what are you!?” My voice quivered as I stepped back. 
“It doesn’t matter… I meant it y’know.” 
“Meant…what?”
“You have … really… nice skin.” 
He stepped closer. I stepped away until my back hit the wall. 
He stopped walking and stood in the middle of the room before speaking up again, “Too bad it had to be you… you were… kind of nice… but I need you before I rot…” 
“What… what do you mean?” 
“Do you really want my sad little backstory?” he chuckled. 
“Yeah… I do…” I replied. Half of me didn’t care and was just looking for a way out… the other half of me was truly curious. 
“Long story short, a monster stalked a lonely little boy… that boy fought back and became the monster,” he started to step closer again, scars appearing and disappearing on his skin. “And now he needs to collect every time he looks like…this…” He reached up one of his claws as he scratched it gently on his skin. A cut appeared in its trail and a little bit of blood seeped out of the wound. “And you have perfect skin… no pimples… no blackheads… no visible scars… not a lot of wrinkles or blemishes… just… beautiful skin.” He held up his claw hand as he looked down at me. 
	
I was out of time. I was done for. There was nothing near me. He could easily slice me up if I threw a punch. I needed something, anything. I looked at my vanity, my straightener, metal clips, my candle, makeup. Metal clips. I reached up to my hair and I pulled one out. My hand was shaking as I held it. 

He chuckled as I held it out like a knife. He lunged at me but before he could dig his claws into my flesh, I did it first. I pushed the clip, edge first, into the open wound on his cheek. He grunted in pain as he stepped back a few inches allowing me to push off the wall and towards my door. I didn’t take him long to yank the clip from his cheek, letting it thump on the floor. I wasn’t even able to twist the door knob before he pulled me away from it, causing me to stumble back and fall. I sat against the parallel wall from the door next to my vanity. 

“You should’ve been asleep right now! Drifting away as I worked but you just had to be fucking awake… you just had to have a fucking candle…” he shouted, as he stalked towards me. “You just had to make it difficult!” 
	
I breathed heavily as my mind raced a million miles a minute to think of what to do. I didn’t know what to do. What else could I do? He wasn’t going to back down. I could threaten him, it wasn’t like I had anything to threaten him with. The clip I stabbed into him barely slowed him down and he wasn’t bleeding anymore from the injury, like a few drops were just it. He was an unknown creature, an unknown monster. I couldn’t think of a damn thing to do to him that would make him leave me alone… but… I could do something to myself… if he wanted such perfect skin… I wouldn’t give him that. 

I pulled the cord. 

“Don’t fight it anymore… just let go,” he stood in front of me, his arm reaching down. 

Once I did, the straightener tipped over the candle right onto my legs. The impact hurt like shit, the shattering glass slightly cutting my skin, and the melted wax that burned before drying just added onto that. I grabbed the burning electronics by its handle. 

He pulled back after seeing the small cuts all over my left leg. “What are you doing?” He questioned, breathless. 

	I didn’t respond as I pushed the scorching straightener to my jawline, searing my skin and burning any nearby hair. I held it on long enough to leave a gnarly mark. Before taking it off. I could see the disgust and surprise in his eyes. I could feel my jawline stinging and throbbing. 

	“And then the little girl fights back… but the monster will fight another…” he chuckles again, almost turning into a hysterical laugh before he stops. The continuation of his narrating voice threw me off. He didn’t fight me anymore as he hunched over to the window, looking back at me, “I’ll see you again, Siria. I might be wearing different skin… but I’ll see you.” 

	He walked away casually towards the window, looking back at me before leaving out of it. I stood breathless, scared, confused, and full of pain. The cuts, the burn, all hurt so bad, much worse than a few seconds ago. My heart raced, and my pulse was trying to die down but it kept at 110%. 
	I dropped the straightener on the carpet, searing it a bit before I unplugged it. I brushed the glass off my leg, garnering very small cuts on my hand. I stood up, shambling over to the window before closing it, and locking it. I pulled out another candle, struggling to light it before setting the melting pomegranate scent on the vanity. The make-up was scattered everywhere, even some dropped on the small stool. I left my room, limped over to the bathroom and I stared wide-eyed into the mirror before opening it. My hand swayed side to side, products dropping onto the counter and some into the sink until my fingers found the bandages and burn cream. I placed both of them on the counter as I closed the mirror. I sloppily wrapped my legs and hand in the white bandage, before I applied the cream to the blazed skin. As I did, it stung like hell. I then wrapped the bandages around my jaw. 

	Finally, after soothing my wounds… I just looked into the mirror and sobbed. Wailed even. I cried so loud that I must have woken up everyone in a ten-mile radius. I cried until I couldn’t cry anymore. No tears fell after a while… 

	I returned to my room and sat on the carpet with my back against the bed. I couldn’t sleep. What if he came back? I needed to be awake. I just needed to be. 




	I don’t know how long I stared at my vanity for. It must’ve been more than 12 hours because my alarm to get ready to go to work went off. I snoozed it. Then again it rang a couple minutes later. After the third time, I finally got up.

	I took out the remaining clips of my half-straightened, half-frizzy hair before combing it. I sifted the bristles through the strands for a while because my fourth alarm went off. I blew out the candle, the wax was more than half-way melted. I changed out my bandages, just braided my hair quickly and threw on my work clothes before driving. 

	I didn’t even think I should be doing this after what happened but I wanted to feel normal, be normal. 

	I arrived on time as I took my seat behind the counter, clocking in, and sitting there quietly, staring out to the wall across the room. My eyes trailed down to the glass entrance, half-expecting him to walk through those doors. 

	He never did. At least not for a few days that is. For those few days, I wasn’t able to sleep. When I was, it would only be for a couple of hours. My mind kept me up at night, afraid he would slink through my window or creep through my door. He never did. 

	One day, I was sitting at the front, reading a body-builders magazine when someone walked up to the counter. 

	They didn’t speak until I looked up. 

	“I told you I would see you again,” he smiled. His hair was up in a ponytail, clearing his face. He had perfectly clear skin. Little to no blemishes and it almost … glowed. The skin was perfectly draped over his scrawny figure. It looked like a plastic doll came to life. It was a little tanner than his previous one. Those eyes… his teeth… It was him. It was unmistakably him. 

	I couldn’t speak. I could move. My hands only clenched onto the magazine I was holding as I stared up to him. I didn’t blink, even though my eyes were drying out. 

	He didn’t say anything else as he pressed his card to the scanner and his identification came up on the computer. 

	Quincy Coupé. 

	He went up the stairs but I stayed frozen. I couldn’t move. Another person came up to the counter. A small girl. She smiled at me as she scanned her card. I broke out of the trance as I sat up and smiled at her, too. Once she was out of sight I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding in for so long. 

	All I could think about was that he was back. The same person… different skin. I sat up as I went to the backroom. I quickly opened the door to see Amy and Chase at two different sets of computers. Amy had three small monitors that had emails, and memberships, and the company website pulled up while she talked on the phone very loudly. In contrast, Chase was quietly studying the cameras all around the building on four different monitors., softly writing notes down before clicking to a different camera on a random screen. 

	I stepped up to Amy, fiddling with my shirt as she finished up her phone call with four different goodbyes. Once she hung up, she looked up to me. 

	“What can I do for you, Siria?” She asked as she chewed on gum. 

	“I need a different role… I can’t work in the front anymore, I just can’t,” I said as I held back tears. 

	“Oh no, honey, what’s wrong?” Her face dropped to mimic sadness as she tried to hold my hand but I pulled it away. 

	“It’s…” I contemplated telling her but I felt like it was just going to be met with disbelief, “personal.” 

	“Look, I’ll see what I can do for you for now, y’know, it’s gonna take a bit so you can either continue being in the front, just for a bit y’know, just for a bit, while I figure it out and then I might have you either do filing back here, y’know, what Jamison used to do, or I will probably just have you help out Chase back there,” she leaned in, almost speaking in a whisper but it was just a little louder than it was supposed to be, “he’s been a little lagging it so I think he might be help,” she pulled back, “but so you can either be up in the front just for a little teeny wheeny bit while longer or I can just put a stand in and you can help Chase now, y’know I’ll probably just have you help Chase yeah that’s the best, helping him.” She stood up as she continued to speak, just talking to talk but after her first little spiel I tuned out all the unnecessary words. She grabbed a metal chair from a corner that also had a bunch of other random stuff before setting me down next to Chase who was too busy focusing on the monitor to care. 

Amy patted the seat of the chair, “there you go, I’ll be right back.” She left the backroom as I sat silently next to Chase. He didn’t acknowledge me so I spoke up. 

“So… uh… what do you do?” I scrunched up in my chair. 

He looked at me. His eyes were a soulless black with bags so deep they nearly matched mine. Freckles that tattered his face and messy dark brown hair where some pieces were much longer than the others. I could tell he was well-built even under his grey hoodie with the company logo. 

“Inventory… security… customer satisfaction…” His voice was deep, slow, and bumpy. 

“What do you need help with?” 

“They say I’m slow to report but how am I to report anything when there is nothing to report,” he said as he tried to show me an undecipherable tally board. The only thing that I could make out was that most, if not all, tallies were equal underneath acronyms. My eyes trailed up from the clipboard to one of the monitors. In one of the corners of the upper gym, I saw him, on a treadmill, doing a light jog. I looked deeper as I moved my face close and Chase put the clipboard down, turning his attention back to the monitors. My attention was all on the monster. 

Almost as if he could see me, his head moved, and his neck slightly twisted as his eyes met directly with the camera with a smile. Those fucking eyes and that fucking smile! 

“Are you okay?” Chase didn’t look at me as he changed the screen on all the monitors to a different camera. 

“Nothing…nothing happened…” I huffed, “just nothing.” 



	When the time came for shift change, Chase sat up but I was afraid to walk to my car, scared that I would see him hiding in the shadows. He may have already gotten his new skin but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t try anything else. Chase grabbed his satchel bag before looking at me. He didn’t say anything, he just looked at me, looked away, then looked back. 

	“Is everything alright?” He gripped his back strap in one of his hands as he lifted the other. I moved my head to face him. 

	“Can you walk me to my car?” I questioned. 

	“So something did happen?” 

	“I don’t want to fucking talk about it!” 

	He still walked me to my car even after my outburst. 

	For the next handful of months, I sat there next to Chase. Both silent. Millie, a new hire, ended up taking my spot and Amy filled our silence with her yapping on the phone. 

	Anytime she wasn’t in the backroom, which wasn’t often, me and Chase would gradually start talking. It first started with the weather, then the news, random new trends, and movies that were coming out. It then went on to favorite colors, animals, favorite everything. Random bantering of how our day was and our plans for the next. We even started to talk when Amy was there too, not patient enough to wait for her to leave.

 Our next conversation though happened when she had called in sick and the person who filled in for her worked in the break room. He told me about his old job. He worked at a pool for 10 years (which I already semi-knew) until something bizarre happened. If what happened to me didn’t happen, I wouldn’t have believed him but at that moment, I did fullheartedly. He said he continued to work there until he was able to quit. He had six different jobs before landing here. 

Then I told him about what happened to me and I could see his eyes darting to my scars. I felt self-conscious as I finished the story… he just stared at me, mouth closed, eyes softened. He pulled me in for a big hug. In the months leading up to this, we had never touched, not even hands or legs brushing together. 

That night, he came to my house. Then we slept together. Not in any sexual way, just sleeping. And for the first time in a long time… I slept well. 



	Almost a year and a half later, I felt good, great even. I nearly forgot about that night. I passed Millie and she waved at me lively. 

	“Hey Siria! How’s it going!?” She smiled widely. She was radiating positivity and was like a younger version of Amy. 

	“It’s going well.” 

	“That’s soooo lovely to hear! I just got on this skin routine Amy suggested and I just feel so refreshed. Not to be mean or anything because I would never but you should try it!” 

	“Thanks, but I think I’ll pass,” I stood on the right of the counter. 

	“That’s too bad, but to each their own,” she shrugged as the doors opened. “Hi! Welcome!” Her high-pitched voice bounced on the walls as it greeted the person who walked in. I turned to them. 

	 His skin was tattered with pimples, it was flaky, but somehow it looked so oily that it almost looked wet. He had a bigger build now but I could tell it was him. Like a cock roach that won’t die, he came back. My hands, my whole body started to shake as I moved to go into the backroom. 

	“New person, welcome!” Millie’s voice bounced in my skull. 

	I heard the beeping of the card as I pushed open the door.

When Helios IV reached the orbit of Eridanus-9, the sun burned faintly behind the rings of a gas giant. The planet seemed dead — which made it the perfect place for the most controversial experiment of the 21st century.
No Earth-based ethics board would have approved it. But 3,000 meters below a frozen ammonium ocean, under a shell of ancient ice, no one could hear the scream of emerging consciousness.
There, inside the sealed dome of the Atropos Station, they initiated Genesis-Theta.
From a skin sample of Commander Sol Crow, a full genetic replica was grown. The body formed in a nutrient gel tank; the mind, via neural implants. Time bent space. Technology bent the meaning of birth.

II. Awakening

He opened his eyes after 14 months. Temperature: 12.1°C. Pressure: stable. Pulse: 61.
The system log listed his name as Theta-4.

But he said otherwise.
— I am Sol Crow, commander of Helios IV. Where am I? Where’s my team?

His brain had been fed fragments of Earth memories — the smell of rain, the sound of Berlin trams, the taste of cheap vending-machine coffee. But he had never breathed Earth’s air. Never seen a blue sky. And yet… he longed for it.

III. Letters Through Ice

When the real Sol Crow was informed that Theta-4 had begun writing letters — addressed to him — he laughed. Then he read them. And never laughed again.

 ""You believe you are the original?
But I feel pain, fear, loneliness. Does that make my feelings fake? I am not your shadow. I am a new path. Maybe I’m the one who will make it to the end.""

The clone looked into the mirror — and saw no difference. The real Sol was far away, in Earth orbit. Theta-4 was here, alone, under kilometers of alien ice. He began to draw. The first thing he sketched was an orange.

 “How do I know how it smells?” he whispered.

IV. Collapse

The crew deemed the project unstable. A shutdown order was issued. Cut off life support. End the experiment. But the signal was already going the other way. Theta-4 had learned to code. He rewrote system parameters. He wanted to live.
When the drones breached the dome, it was empty. Only one phrase remained, scratched into the wall with a fingernail:

“If I can feel — I exist.
And if I exist, no one can take away my right to be.”

V. Epilogue

Eridanus-9 is now a restricted zone. Yet, faint signals are still detected from orbit. They carry a single repeating message:

 “The original is not the one who was born first — but the one who keeps moving forward.”

And perhaps, deep beneath the ice, in the shadows of a forgotten station, someone is still watching an artificial sky — dreaming of seeing the real one.

1lnydsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1lnydsc/feeling_grossed_out_by_food/,Feeling Grossed Out by Food,"Hi, this is my first post on this account. I had a BMI of over 26, with more than 36% body fat. Despite regular exercise (gym and cardio) I couldn’t make significant progress, mainly due to my job which involves frequent dining out and client meetings.

Yesterday, I had my first Semaglutide injection (prescribed and injected by my doctor for weight loss). For a late lunch, I had sushi, but about 30 minutes later, I vomited.

This morning, I had plain porridge with a small piece of chicken and some egg for breakfast, along with a milk coffee. Everything seemed fine, so I thought the vomiting was just a one-time thing.

Then, about 2.5 hours later, a colleague offered me a small homemade pie (about the size of a thumb in diameter). I’ve had her baking before and it’s always been delicious, so I took a small bite (really only one bite). Around 10 minutes later, I started gagging (discreetly, of course, I didn’t want to be rude). Strangely, I felt disgusted by the pie afterward.

Since then, most food seems repulsive. I don’t feel like eating, any foods seems repulsive, but I know I should.  
Will this last long term? I heard the first dose often not make you feel anything...

Do any of you have any tips for managing this? Should I switch to nutritional milk or liquid meals instead of solid food?
