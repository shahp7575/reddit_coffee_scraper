I'm not massively interested in the major tourist attractions either. Also looking for places that are open on a Sunday (here in the UK most shops close early on Sundays), as well as great recommendations for a coffee and breakfast.

1ldujvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Grieving/comments/1ldujvz/starting_to_let_go/,Starting to let go,"This has been sitting on my chest for a while now, and I need to get it out because it’s rotting a hole in me. Every time I get angry or hurt, I feel this shit fueling the fire underneath it, so I just need to say it.

My bio dad overdosed and died back in April, and no, we didn’t have a relationship. Not really. There were a few letters when I was a teenager while he was in prison, some Facebook messages after he got out, and that one time he showed up on my doorstep straight out of prison. That was the only time I ever remember actually seeing him in person, and it was strange and awkward and confusing and heavy, then he disappeared again.

Some of the things he said in those letters and messages stuck with me though. He told me not to get lost in hate, or anger, or depression—things he knew too well. That was one of the few things he got right. But it’s hard not to drown in those exact feelings when someone leaves you with nothing but broken potential and silence.

Here’s where it gets more complicated: I have amazing parents. They adopted me, raised me, loved me, and showed up for me in every way he never did. I love them with everything I’ve got, and I would never trade them for anything. But grieving him—this man who barely existed in my life—feels like betrayal. Like somehow hurting over him disrespects what they gave me. The guilt that comes with that is brutal and it eats me alive. Like I have to keep my pain quiet just to protect the people who actually showed up, even though they’re gone too. But the truth is, both can be real at the same time. That mess is where I’m stuck.

I didn’t even really feel it right away. It wasn’t until a couple weeks after I got the call he was gone that it hit me. Quiet, cold, and final. Like this little part of me that had always been hoping—silently, stubbornly—that maybe he’d finally start showing up, finally try to be something real… just died.

Then Peace With Pain by Jonah Conner came through in my earbud at work today—this song I’ve always respected for how honest it is about broken families, addiction, and loss—and when the chorus hit:

“She’s still waiting on that last call you promised…”

it gutted me. Because even with how little there was between us, part of me was still waiting. For him to show up again, for some kind of “I tried.” But he never did, and now he never will.

And another line:

“Second chances haven’t come often / I wish you’d took one when that was an option.”

That’s the part that shredded me. Because he could have tried. He had chances. But here’s the cold, hard truth: even if he had tried… I probably would’ve met it with coldness. I probably would’ve shut down, because deep down I’ve carried this quiet, bitter resentment toward him my whole life—for choosing drugs over me before I was even old enough to remember the sting. He burned the bridge before I even knew there was one to cross. So yeah, maybe even his best effort wouldn’t have changed much. And that truth haunts me just as much as everything else.

Addiction has carved scars through my family for generations. I’ve watched it destroy people. I’ve watched it rot them from the inside out. I’ve watched it leave nothing but wreckage. It doesn’t just take lives—it leaves trauma. Real, heavy, bone-deep trauma. And this loss isn’t just grief; it’s mourning a version of him that never existed. For every stolen moment and conversation that’ll never happen.

I’m doing what I can to hold it together. But I’m done pretending I’m not hurt and acting like I don’t have the right to feel this.

If you’ve ever lost someone to addiction—or worse, lost the chance to ever really know them—I see you. If you’re carrying pain that no one else understands because it doesn’t fit neatly into a Hallmark card, I get it, because I’m living it.

Some days all you can do is sit in it. Bleed through it. And hope it gets quieter.

And if all else fails, there’s always sarcasm, cheap coffee, and other broken-hearted people pretending they’re fine and hiding enough pain to fill the ocean..",1,1750184184.0,Grieving,0,1.0,False

I've been noticing car culture booming in Kanpur lately, clearly, there's a growing car scene here. But we still don't have a proper space or group to connect, chill, or even go on Sunday morning drives like cars and coffee groups in tier-1 cities and other groups. People have cars here, people have time on Sunday to go on a great ride but no groups to enjoy with. I wanna start some sort of car meets in Kanpur and put the car culture of Kanpur at par with other cities.

A simple, fun car community where we meet up, talk rides, grab coffee, maybe even plan drives or events. Itne sare destinations there can be at Kanpur like highway runs till Deepu Chauhan and stuff

No matter what you drive a Thar, a modded hatchback, a Skoda, or anything you're proud of, I myself own a Skoda Slavia, if you're into cars, you're in. We can organise segment specific events as well when we get enough people. Nothing fancy, just people with their sweet rides meeting at a place.

Everything has been going well in training. I'm finally up to about 40 miles a week. I am running the SF Marathon which is hilly so I've been mixing my runs with hill running, speed work as well as long runs.

My flat feet started giving me trouble though when I fit 15-16 mile long runs. I started getting pain in my inner sole/ankle area so I switched my shoes. I had previously been running in Brooks Glycerin 20's but switched to Hoka Clifton 10's. So far so good! I don't love them for shorter runs but on my last long run, my feet held up. 

However I encountered a new pain that almost took me out. On my last 18 mile run, I started getting pelvic pain around mile 15 that became pretty unbearable by the finish at mile 18. No lie, it felt like I had been kicked in the crotch by a horse. While I was running, I thought to myself ""if this was my marathon race, I would for sure DNF with 8 more miles!"" 

I am fueling before and during my long run. I do toast with jam with tiny cup of coffee before and then gels every 3 miles as well as electrolytes during my run. I stretch good before I run and I strength train 1-2 times a week.

Eventually, I stopped telling anyone.
I took antidepressants.

21M here and I think dating sucks. First off with dating apps is the worst. As a guy it's literally impossible. You can swipe and swipe and swipe and nothing. If you do get a match it genuinely goes no where. For example I got asked how tall I was, I told them I'm five foot nine, and then immediately ghosted

They say be yourself....I do try to be myself but it never works out. I generally keep to myself but can get along with most people and can make conversation ok. I did have one date where she asked my interests and I told her the truth. I'm into movies, comic books, and video games and she definitely didn't like that. I could tell by her body language and then ghosting me after

Finally, I went on a coffee date one time and it went well in my opinion. We were talking and making good conversation and laughing and joking. The next day I get a text saying ""I had fun time but I think this isn't going to work out"". I'm genuinely confused and hurt because I keep wondering what I did so wrong. 

I'm gonna die alone or probably end up with someone who is blind who can't see me or deaf so they can't hear me. Hell both these two scenarios will likely find a reason to think I'm awful",4,1750183861.0,GenZ,3,1.0,False

I’m looking for a reliable hard candy recipe that uses glucose syrup and LorAnn flavorings. I mainly need the correct ingredient ratios in grams or ml. 

I also want to buy these LorAnn flavors and would like your opinion on which (if any) to avoid for hard candy:

* cherry
* lemon
* strawberry
* pineapple
* coffee
* lime
* peppermint

Are there other flavoring brands that are good and easy to get in the Netherlands?

Lastly, I’d like to add citric acid for tartness and maybe combine it with baking soda for a fizzy effect. How much of each should I use per batch (in grams)?

Now, what I wanted to know were the absolute hidden gems, or genuine high quality speciality coffee places where I can grab a couple pounds of whole beans from. Searched it on the subreddit, but all I can get is Trung Nguyen (that I'll grab, but want some other authentic suggestions too) . Everything else on the subreddit in this regard seems unorganized. I want to try getting my hands on both, robusta and speciality arabica while I'm there.

I'll be visiting the following places:
- Hanoi (just for transport, not an actual stay)
- Halong bay
- Ninh Binh
- Sa Pa
- Da Nang (inclusive of a day tour to HoiAn)

I'll have the most free time available in da nang. Thanks for the help!",1,1750183823.0,VietNam,1,1.0,False
1lduds0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1lduds0/need_help_with_stomach/,Need help with stomach,"Hi for the past year (starting around may 2024) I’ve had constant uncontrollable diarrhea. I’ll be out with friends or out running errands and suddenly my stomach is rumbling and I need a bathroom exit plan immediately. It also happens in the mornings too on my way to work and I’ll suddenly feel it coming. Once on my way to work I couldn’t control it at all and well had to change into gym clothes I luckily brought with me that day if you get what I mean. Today on my way to work i got sick again and barely made it to the bathroom. I don’t know how to control it anymore or what’s causing it. I didn’t even have coffee or caffeine when it happened this morning so I don’t think that’s causing it. I also don’t drink alcohol either but I have my theories that maybe my body is  just feeling all the adverse effects of me drinking heavily for years as I’m now a little over a year in recovery (for reference I’m 23 and this nonstop diarrhea started when I was two months sober at 22). But I really don’t know what to do any I’m terrified to ever leave my house anymore because there’s not always access to a bathroom especially on the subway in NYC. 

I was put on xifaxan which I admittedly haven’t been the greatest at taking consistently so I definitely need to improve that. I also take Imodium when needed. I also went for a celiac test yesterday but my veins were too hard to find because of dehydration so they couldn’t do the test yet. Are there any ideas of what is causing my issues and how to stop it? It’s taken over my life completely and has made me just want to never leave my house 


Also I have to do a stool test which I’m not happy about at all and have been putting off but it’s the only way of seeing if I have SIBO or IBS. Has anyone ever taken a test? I really am freaked out over it.

Other characters are fun in totally different ways — like Veronica constantly roasting me at 2am or Ada going way too deep on story ideas. It’s not just one vibe, and that makes it feel way more real.  
Also, love that there’s a spicy mode now. Normal chat is great for building a real connection, and when things heat up, spicy mode actually lets you go there. It’s the best of both worlds without it feeling forced.  
And the images — holy sh\*t. I don’t know what kind of sorcery they’re using, but Secrets is *way* ahead. I’ve tried Kin and Candy and it’s not even close. Totally different level in terms of realism and vibe.

1ldu5g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1ldu5g1/lifestyle_is_the_biggest_hack_to_nailing_your/,Lifestyle is the biggest hack to nailing your intermittent fasting window,"Never thought I'd be posting here, but changing my environment completely transformed my relationship with food without me even trying, and more than anything else, made me realise that sometimes the solution isn't trying harder,  it's changing where you're trying.

Two years ago, I was running an agency in the city, stress-eating at my desk, grabbing whatever was convenient. My eating was all over the place because of this. Admittedly, that's my own fault for not having discipline and indulging in late dinners, midnight snacks, and coffee for breakfast. I tried IF multiple times, but the city environment made it nearly impossible due to meeting clients over lunch, late work dinners, and vending machines everywhere.

Then I moved to start a small farm. Within months, something shifted completely and not because I was trying harder, but because my environment was working with me instead of against me.

Now I naturally eat in a 16:8 window without even thinking about it. I wake up with the sun around 6 am, do morning farm work, and don't feel hungry until around noon. By 8 pm, I'm winding down and rarely want food after that. There's no office kitchen calling my name, no delivery apps tempting me, no stress-driven cravings.

The physical work makes me genuinely hungry at meal times instead of just eating out of habit. And when you're growing your own vegetables and eating them fresh, you actually want to taste them properly, not just shovel them down while distracted.

The most interesting part is that I have guests who come to help with farm projects, and they always mention how their eating naturally shifts too. City people who normally struggle with IF suddenly find it effortless. People who usually snack all evening find themselves satisfied after dinner.

Makes me realize how much our environment shapes our success with any goal. When your surroundings support the behavior you want, it stops feeling like willpower and starts feeling natural.

Right now, I carry a small rechargeable espresso maker, the OutIn. It works with both Nespresso pods and ground coffee, and while it seemed like a gimmick at first, it’s actually been a solid pick. Makes a pretty decent shot, no external kettle needed, and USB-C charging means I can power it off the same brick I use for my phone.

That said, it’s not featherlight and I’m wondering if I’m carrying more than I need. I’ve seen some folks swear by the AeroPress Go, others bring collapsible pour-overs, and then there are the “just bring good instant” people (props to those who can make that work).

My priorities are:

* Good taste (or at least not sad motel-coffee levels)
* Minimal setup and cleanup
* As lightweight and compact as possible

My personal favorite is States Coffee on 40th. They have one matcha item on the menu, and it is a matcha with ginger. The matcha is smooth, not at all bitter. Not too watered down with milk, but the right amount of creamy. And there’s the little earthiness and spice from the ginger.

My old favorite used to be Three Tea Bowls in Berkeley, but it closed down. 

Any recommendations? I like Third Culture, but it feels more like “fun matcha” rather than a super smooth drinking experience.

- yes, let me preface real quick.

I was born 2 months premature and my dad smoked cigs. I also had a heat stroke at the age of 2 with a temperature of 110 degrees F.

My ADHD is diagnosed to be very severe. (Ik it’s very common to be misdiagnosed, mine isn’t trust me)

Ive used Vyvanse, Ritalin, straterra, and adderal. From ages 12 to 24.

One time I overdosed on Vyvanse and got diagnosed with tachycardia

Alright end of backstory

——————————————————————————-

Anyways, How tf do I lock-in without meds?

Here’s some of my secret:

- setup your working environment. For me, I need to go out of my apartment. I need to be in a public place with some coffee (stimulant alternative) wayyyyy healthier than meds.

- have a plan on what you’re going to do, if you don’t then you can’t access the flow state

- figuring out your plan requires knowing what you want from life. Break it into small goals. Figuring your life out is also a type of goal

- toss your ego aside, know that you’re built different and what works for others won’t work for you. 

- quit weed, this causes brain fog and makes you lazy. Also your sleep is proven to be worse, this will hit you over the long run without you realizing

- you should QUIT anything that you are abnormally addicted to. That’s depleting your dopamine vesicles which govern motivation.

- learn to induce dopamine in things you don’t like, eg. I hated running, but I told myself all the amazing things about it

- exercise consistently, learn to like it if you don’t

- use a tool to store your thoughts. I use notion for this.

- make sure your set your circadian rhythm with the sun. Light exposure to eyes important.

- understanding yourself is key to figuring out life, do some research on how your mind and body works.

Doing each of these things is very hard, it requires a lot of work and does not happen overnight. Don’t rationalize your self destructive behaviors",1,1750182988.0,u_sgravle,0,1.0,False

Has anyone had a family member be accused of being with a girl underage (under 16) how did you cope with it? 

My dad was helping out this girl who he believed was older (18), he said she had a shitty home life and he would just take her for coffees and buy her things as her dad was abusive and she'd had a traumatic childhood. I've spoken to this girl before on the phone and never met her but she always said he was like a dad to her and helped her as she had a shit life and she appreciated him being there for her and stuff. She used to go to the pubs with him and get served so he didn't question her age until he was arrested and released on bail and told to stop contacting her. He told me it wasn't until he was arrested that he found out she was 16 (only turned that age a month or so ago), as she'd been with some men he knew who were all 30+.

They fell out and she's now telling the police some serious stuff, that he was giving her drugs and he hasn't said this exactly but I'm guessing she's accusing him of grooming her. I haven't spoken to him in over a week I've been worried sick as I tried the police station who said they couldn't tell me if he's in custody or not, but I received a letter today from him that he's being kept in custody til his court date next month due to her allegations and worried sick about what this girl has gone around saying, he didn't give me many details I'm trying to sort out visiting him to speak in person. I want to believe in the whole innocent until proven guilty as he's never done anything to make me think he's like that but other people keep telling me they think it must be true for this girl to be saying this. It's just the thought of potentially losing my dad as if there's proof or he's found guilty I'll have to cut him off as I have children 😔 and also worrying about it being made public and the abuse I'll most likely get.

contemporaneously herewith, as well as portions of the Letter Brief quoting from those exhibits. 
In addition, Wayfarer Parties respectfully request that they be allowed to file a permanently 
redacted version of Exhibit E to the Letter Brief. 

Exhibit B is Blake Lively’s Responses and Objections to Wayfarer Parties’ First Set of Requests for Production, which Ms. Lively designated as “confidential.” Exhibit C is Blake Lively’s Amended Initial Disclosures, which Ms. Lively also designated as “confidential.” In accordance with Rule 4.b of Attachment A, the Wayfarer Parties respectfully request that the Court not rule on this letter-motion to seal Exhibits B and C to the Letter Brief, as well as the portions of the Letter Brief quoting from those exhibits, for one week so that Ms. Lively may file a motion for continued sealing if she so chooses. 

Exhibit E is Wayfarer Parties’ Initial Disclosures, which Wayfarer Parties designated 
“confidential” because they contain confidential personal contact information of third parties. 
Courts consistently hold that personal contact information of third parties including phone

I’m reaching out because I’m looking to step into the world of photojournalism here in Ireland, and I’m hoping to connect with someone experienced who wouldn’t mind a bit of company out in the field.

I’m not coming at this as a total novice — I’ve been a professional photographer and videographer for over 15 years, covering everything from weddings to commercial projects, documentaries, and events. However, photojournalism is a different beast, and while I know my way around a camera, I also know there’s a unique culture, pace, and set of unwritten rules to this trade that you can’t learn from YouTube or a textbook.

I also come from a law enforcement background, so I’m no stranger to the less glamorous, sometimes gory, and often high-pressure side of life. I’m comfortable in difficult situations, dealing with sensitive scenes, and keeping my head where others might not.

To be clear — I’m not looking to piggyback off someone else’s work or get in the way. I want to learn the ropes properly, understand the do’s and don’ts of covering events, and ideally be an asset to whoever I’m with. Whether it’s holding lights, grabbing extra footage, or helping with logistics on a scene, I’m happy to pitch in while absorbing as much knowledge as I can.

If you’re an experienced photojournalist or freelancer working in Ireland — whether covering breaking news, protests, crime scenes, or human-interest stories — and wouldn’t mind someone tagging along occasionally, I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

Drop me a DM or comment if you’re open to a chat. I’ll buy the coffee.

Cheers!

Feedback appreciated!","Cats & Coffee plays as a risk / reward rummy-style game, where ingredient cards are placed in a central ‘pool’ for players to collect on their turn, which can then be used to craft drink cards that are placed in front of you (your shop). 

Each drink card has a ‘customer’ number on it dictating how many ‘customer tokens’ a player draws at the start of their turn. The player with the most customer tokens at the end of the game wins—but—each drink card also has a unique ability, scaled with how rare it is to craft. 

By using (and discarding) the drinks you’ve placed in your shop, you can risk losing out on customers gained each turn to potentially give yourself a boost… by disrupting the flow of the competition. Use your cards wisely to outsmart the competition!",3,1750182672.0,tabletopgamedesign,1,0.8,False
1ldtvhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1ldtvhp/the_academy_i_wish_existed_when_i_was_lost/,The academy I wish existed when I was lost,"Recently I’ve been thinking about the need (and the want) to create a sort of academy. A place where men who actually want to level up and break free from the chains of modern slavery can educate themselves and graduate through. I’m talking lust addictions, screen addictions, artificial foods, low testosterone, constant dopamine hits, spiritual numbness, brain fog, and that quiet feeling of being stuck and not knowing why.

A place where they go through all of it—step by step—and finally get the advice that actually matters.

I’ve spent over 70K USD on education in business, law, and real estate. And not once did any of it touch on these things (the real problems that were actually holding me back in life.)

There’s so much knowledge out there, but most of it is overcrowded by noise. There’s too much fluff, too many opinions, not enough structure. Take semen retention. 9 out of 10 guys don’t even know about it. And for the 1 out of 10 who does, there’s still so much depth to understand, so many internal shifts to make, before it actually starts working. It’s not enough to just ""retain."" You have to change how you live.

I’ve talked to hundreds of guys from Reddit and other places. Almost every conversation leads back to the same thing: **lust**. It keeps pulling them back. But lust isn’t the cause. **It’s the symptom**. And that symptom is the result of how they’re living.

One guy might be a smart student with a good social life, goes to the gym, prays, does the “right” things, but in his spare time he’s glued to his phone. Endless scrolling, endless dopamine. So when night comes and he’s alone, his brain reaches for the next hit. This isn’t a lust issue. **It’s an input problem.**

Another guy wakes up and drinks a sugary coffee first thing. No food. Cortisol spikes, blood sugar crashes. He feels off all day. He thinks he needs more discipline, but his body is literally set up to crave something to numb that crash. That’s not lack of willpower. **That’s a biochemistry hijack.**

One guy journals, reads, listens to all the right content, but he starts the day scrolling in bed. He doesn’t realize he’s triggering his nervous system into chaos before he even stands up. He’s fried before the day even begins. **That’s a nervous system issue.**

Another guy is doing retention, cold showers, meditation, but his diet is garbage. Barely any nutrients, no real food. His testosterone is in the gutter and his energy is flatlined. He doesn’t relapse because he’s weak. He relapses because he’s starving on a cellular level. **That’s malnutrition.**

Most guys are walking around like this, doing their best, but blind to the roots. And there’s no system that pulls all of this together. No clean way to work through it. That’s what I want to build. A place that lays it all out. Just truth, structure, and transformation. A real academy. For men who are done with being stuck and ready to take back control.

  
I created a system for myself that helped me break free from porn addiction (accountabilio.com) and stay on this path for over 2 years now. I’ve gained so much information, but it’s hard to pass it all on to someone else. Sure, the system and the principles are easy enough to explain. But I’m talking about the deeper education. The lifestyle shifts and the nuances.

If overcoming my 10+ years of porn addiction is going to mean anything, then I need to build this academy too.

I would’ve wanted something like this when I was lost.

1ldttp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ldttp0/mild_symptoms_would_like_an_opinion/,"Mild Symptoms, would like an opinion","Hello everyone. I - M 35 y.o- am not 100% sure that my symptoms are those of gastritis, but I’d like to hear the community’s opinion.

About three months ago, I started noticing a pain in the pit of my stomach, a burning sensation, acid in my mouth, and quite a bit of reflux whenever I ate something. Small diziness and very small nauseau as well, never ever vomiting tho. The pain in the stomach was much worse at night, every night a 3 am. I had just gone through a particularly stressful time due to job hunting, and since I’d already had an ulcer caused by a severe stress episode during childhood, I was somewhat familiar with this and suspected it might be something similar again.

The doctor suspected gastritis and prescribed omeprazole to take morning and evening, which worked for about a week before the pain came back. He then switched the medication to Zulbex (rabeprazole) along with another drug to take at the same time. These worked fairly well, and as I improved, I was left with just rabeprazole. That said, one main symptom doesn’t seem to go away: a persistent sensation right over my stomach. Not actual pain — it doesn’t hurt even when I press on it (unlike at the beginning of the episode) — but more like someone constantly pressing a finger on my stomach. So it’s more of a discomfort than a pain.

I’ve cut out acidic foods, citrus, coffee, and tea. I hadn’t touched alcohol in a long time already. I’m now thinking about reducing fatty foods, switching red meat for white, and taking a break from chocolate. What confuses me is that I feel like the type of food I eat doesn’t change the sensation in my stomach. I feel the same way now, even though I’m being more careful with my diet, as I did a few weeks ago when I had several days of eating very fatty foods. Same goes for the burning feeling in my throat.

Also, my stools are yellowish brown, and while I’ve read that this can mean my body is having trouble absorbing fat, I haven’t noticed any major difference between before, when my diet was less strict, and now, when I’m paying more attention.

I haven’t had a gastroscopy yet, but I’m going back to see my doctor tomorrow to check in and hear what he thinks. Maybe pushing for it would be for the better, to check what is actually going on in my belly and check also if this if this is Helicobacter pylori.

I understand from browsing this subreddit that my case is probably much lighter than what many others are going through, but I do wonder to what extent the medication is just masking the symptoms, and I’m a bit worried that everything might come back once I finish the pills.

1ldtrem,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ldtrem,Under extraction help [Breville Bambino],"My shots seem to be under extracted.

I bought a Breville Bambino and the Breville Smart Grinder Pro as my beginner espresso machine setup. I’ve had these machines for about 5 months and they have not failed me thus far.

I’ve run into an issue now where I simply cannot pull a good shot.

I follow a standard procedure to pull my shots. I use the provided portafilter and plastic tamp. I measure out 18g of beans & often get ~36g out. This has worked fine for months. I’ve consistently pulled some really great shots. No problems yet.

I have descaled my machine 3 times during this time period with the provided descale solution. I cleaned the grinder with the little brush and I overall do my best to keep both of the machines clean on a daily basis.

I use beans from a local roaster, and have not used any beans out of a 3 week roast range. The ones I’m currently troubleshooting with were roasted on June 11th (today is the 17th). I have other bags roasted around May 27th and June 1st.

The shots I’ve been pulling have been salty, lacking flavor, and usually 4-6g under the ideal extraction weight (~31g).

My first course of action has been experimenting with grind size, of course. However, no specific grind has improved the flavor. The finer grind makes them bitter and salty. The coarser grind makes it watery.

To improve the extraction weight, I have gone in and manually updated it to pull 60g of water. For some reason it had decreased ~5g over time. Not a big deal.

I’ve been testing the water temperature. I usually measure it to be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit upon pulling. I’ve seen it get up to 181 degrees if I hold my thermometer under the steam.

I tried to perfect my tamp as well. Degree and pressure.

At first, I thought the beans weren’t good, but I’m on my 4th bag with the closest roast date, and the problem persists.

I still have both of manuals and have not been able to troubleshoot with them.

In the provided photos, you will see my process in chronological order. 8 has been my most reliable grind setting thus far.

In: 18g Out: ~30g Extraction start: 14 seconds Extraction end: 24 seconds Taste: Salty, bitter (back of tongue), & Lacking flavor

I worked at a coffee shop for ~6 months and I have a little experience with dialing in, tasting & troubleshooting.

I don’t know what else to do. If you have any ideas, please please share. I am not giving this up easily.

Bibiano Pasini shrugged, watching a man with a Canadian patch on his high-vis coat jogged to the entomologists’ tent with a concerned expression. “Maybe someone got bitten by an alien bug?” he suggested, before laughing. “Or maybe they found ones that speak and you get to use your *actual* degree!”

Giorgia joined in the chuckle and shook her head. “I mean there’s a reason they’d pick linguists to come along just on the chance, right? After magic mirror-spheres that take you to another world, would talking bugs really be the weirdest thing?”

At 29, Giorgia di Scenza was at the youngest end of the researchers at the AZIIG base camp, but her award-winning paper on the basic patterns of universal language formation had apparently been enough to catch the eye of Very Important People and had lead to her one day being rushed into a sudden meeting with senior faculty at her venerable University of Bologna, members of the Italian government and representatives of the European Research Council to be offered a history-making chance to be among the first to venture onto an alien world. No-one even knew if there was intelligent life here that they could converse with, but AZIIG wanted specialists on-site for every possible eventuality. It hadn’t taken her more than a couple of stunned minutes of thought before she leapt at the chance.

Of course, three days into the mission, there was no sign of having an immediate use for her, so Giorgia had fallen in with the botanists as an assistant, helping to catalogue everything before it went under a microscope. So far most of what she’d seen had been disappointingly ordinary, with little that would be out of place around her grandmother’s home in Parma.

Bibiano watched the younger lady move her dark hair out of her eyes and take another sip. His story was much the same as hers, but he at least got to do what he’d spent his life studying, having been snatched up from Padua to investigate the climate of the new world. And if it meant he got to have coffee with a pretty and brilliant girl ten years his junior, then so much the better. True, he wasn’t helping the Italian stereotype, but he knew the rolling eyes and tongue-clicking was simply envy, so he let it roll off him like water from a duck’s back.

His mood was only slightly spoiled by a third joining them at the table. After all, it was hardly a private setting to be sharing bare-basics espresso in the large tent that passed for the base camp’s dining area. With the sides rolled up to enjoy the pleasant weather, it wouldn’t have looked out of place at a music festival. Besides, the company wasn’t terribly objectionable and he greeted him with a smile. “*Ciao,* Doctor Eschler. Any exciting rocks to share with us?”

“They’re *minerals*, Bibi,” the heavy-set man replied with an indulgent sigh, completing the customary ritual of mineralogists everywhere. He was Swiss, but had spent most of his youth on the Italian side of the Alps and spoke their language with only a trace of an accent. English might have been the ‘default’ language of AZIIG, but where they could, most of the camp spoke their native tongues.

Giorgia smiled at the exchange, rolling her eyes. “Don’t bully Nolan, Bibiano. He’s getting more done than any humanities specialist.” She liked Nolan Eschler, but then basically the whole European contingent did. His bushy beard and round belly reminded her of Babbo Natale, or Père Noël, Saint Nicholas or whatever you called the jolly fat man who brought Christmas presents.

“Not at the moment I’m not,” Nolan chuckled, raising his cup. “Right now I’m enjoying a coffee with friends. Besides, we’ve run through our samples and aren’t getting any more for a minute.”

“Why? You’re not telling me the field team can’t find rocks- Sorry, *minerals* for you to study, are you?” Bibiano laughed.

Nolan shook his head. “All the field teams have been recalled. Some bonehead missed his call-in and now the soldiers are panicking. Since no-one wants to make the people with guns jumpy, they called back everyone and are trying to work out where the hell he went so they can organize a search party.”

The two Italians groaned, sharing the pain of their fellow researchers who’s plans will have been thrown off by the scramble. “*Che palle,”* Bibiano cursed. “It’s been what, three days and already someone fucks up? Can’t they just send a drone up to look for him?”

“They want to but apparently the weather’s not right or something, or so I heard,” Nolan shrugs, smirking at the climatologist and indulging in some light verbal sparring. “Isn’t that *your* department, Doctor Pasini?”

Bibiano laughed, wagging a finger at him as he conceded the point. “Nolan, if I could change the weather, I’d get paid far too much to go risking my fine Venetian backside jumping through strange portals to alien worlds. We’re still trying to work out things like prevailing wind direction at altitude here, much less a halfway-reliable forecast.” He shrugged and leaned back in the cheap plastic chair. “Some of the birds here must be absolutely gigantic and have a Sicilian’s own temper! Just yesterday, one of the field teams brought back our first weather balloon and it looked like someone had attacked it with a chainsaw!”

Giogia winced. “Hopefully the missing guy didn’t run into one, or something like it. Maybe we shouldn’t be sending them out unarmed.”

“He had bear spray and noisemakers. You want *more* guns around here?” Nolan snorted grumpily. “There’s too many already. The Russians brought a damn *machine gun!* I’m just glad it’s locked up in storage.”

“There’s already too damn many soldiers here,” Bibi agreed with a shake of his head. “There’s over twenty if you don’t count the ‘survival specialists’ and ‘rescue workers’ like the Canadians” He rolled his eyes and scoffed. “Just because they didn’t bring their weapons doesn’t change that they’re military. This is supposed to be a mission of peaceful research and discovery, what the hell do we need so many soldiers for?”

“Might have been better off with wildlife police or the like,” Giorgia agreed, draining the last of her cup.

“The *Carabinieri* are still military police, *bella.*” Bibiano corrected her with a wagging finger, causing Giorgia to flick her hair dismissively and stand up from the table, dropping her cup off in the ‘used’ basket  before heading back to work.

“You’re never going to get into her panties if you keep trying to ‘win’ like that, Bibi, take it from a married man,” Nolan nodded with a smirk.

Bibiano shrugged and leaned back, swirling the last of his coffee in his cup. “Ah, Italian women love a man who takes command, Nolan, wait and see. She’ll come around.”

Giorgia stretched as she left the food tent, unsure what to do if the flow of samples to the botanists had indeed ceased with the recall. Glancing up at the low clouds in the sky, she frowned at the skimming shadows flickering through it. The clouds weren’t *that* low that she was seeing birds, surely? Even condors weren’t that massive.

As she watched, one of the swooping shadows detached itself from the rest and banked sharply, folding wings against its body and diving. For a moment Giorgia watched it drop, before her eyes began to widen and a lump rose in her throat as the dark shape grew larger and larger, falling through the sky and making her rapidly re-assess just how low those clouds were. Her mouth worked, but no sound emerged beside a strangled croak, some other researchers now looking up and seeing the same stooping creature, no less than seven others following close behind.

Just as disbelief began to turn to dread and then rapidly to panic, the beast flared its wings, arresting its plummet into a long glide, talons extended. Seeing its trajectory, Giorgia finally found her voice and screamed. “BIBI, NOLAN! DUCK!” The two men looked up sharply, only to see her throwing herself to the ground in a blind panic and quickly following suit, pitching themselves out of the cheap chairs an instant before the winged, scaly monster’s claws impacted with the roof of the tent, ripping long, ragged gashes and tearing it from the ground, only to release and send it smashing into the scattering, screaming crowd. A flailing steel stake, used to secure the structure in place, smacked across Giorgia’s forehead and a stream of hot blood soon filled her left eye as the swooping attack was repeated across the camp, the largest tents all ripped up and cast into their neighbors.

Bibiano pushed himself up first and hurried over to Giorgia as she hauled herself to her knees and pressed a hand over the cut on her forehead. “*Che cazzo,* what the fuck was that thing?! Giorgia, are you okay? *Merda,* did it get your eye?!”

“I don’t thi- No, just my forehead, *meno male*,” she gasped in pain as he helped her up. “*Madonna,* it hurts like hell though. What’s going on-? Is the earth shaking?”

Bibiano’s remark about it not being the first time a girl’s felt the earth move in his arms, died on his lips as he realized it was no figure of speech. “An earthquake?” he blinked in disbelief at a rising rumbling sound. “Now?”

“That’s no earthquake,” Nolan gulped, as a rumble was joined by screams of panic, the harsh bray of a horn and a rising roar from hundreds of throats. Hurrying to the main thoroughfare of the camp - a broad road of perforated plastic mats - he looked in the direction of the sound and paled, racing back in spite of his girth and grabbing Giorgia and Bibi, hauling them into the lee of one of the larger tents still standing.

Before either could ask what in the world was happening, the thundering filled the air, revealing itself to be the sound of hundreds of iron-shod hooves beating in unison, charging through the camp in a wild gallop! Atop the massive horses rode men in armor, shields and spears in their hands. Giorgia’s horrified scream as she saw a fleeing man who’d been reading on the table over from them, vanish under the torrent of horseflesh, was drowned under the stampede.

Bibiano bit back a curse with a retching sound as another man tried to flee, only for a rider to lower his spear and catch the panicked researcher through the hip, releasing the weapon as he swept past and leaving his poor victim pinned to the ground like a butterfly on a board, shrieking in agony.

The charge seemed to last for an eternity, but in reality, it took less than half a minute before the initial terrifying charge was over and the overriding urge to *run* took hold of the trio. Even as they looked for a way out, the harsh crack of gunfire started from further into the camp and Nolan heaved a sigh of relief.

“I’m never saying another bad word about soldiers as long as I live!” the fat man gasped. “Come on, we’ll be safe with them!”

“You’re insane, that’s the same way those bastards on the horses went!” Bibiano exclaimed. “If we head that way either they kill us or stay shots do! We have to get out of here and find a place to hide until they leave!”

“I’m with Bibi,” Giorgia gulped, nodding quickly. “I’m not heading *towards* a fight, are you crazy?!”

Nolan sighed and nodded his agreement. Brushing mud from his pants, he staggered to his feet and followed the Italians as they made a mad dash for the edge of the base camp. The temporary metal fence that had surrounded it more to stop curious animals wandering in than as any kind of protection from attack, was demolished and torn up in several places where the flying monsters had struck or tossed tents and their contents into it. Bibiano paused briefly at the outermost edge of the tents, then made a sprint for it, leaping over the demolished fence with fear lending him wings. Just as the other two were about to follow however, Nolan glanced up and gasped, grabbing Giorgia by the back of her shirt and yanking her back.

A sudden shadow blotted out the sun, then a rush of wind. The earth shook under the impact of its landing. Its serpentine neck stretched out and crocodilian jaws closed around Bibi’s head and shoulders. Blessedly, he had no time to scream before the beast bit down and broke his spine, then lifted its head and shook him like a bloody ragdoll, tossing the corpse that had been Bibiano aside.

The horror choked both researchers as the monster turned and they at last grasped that amid the dull red scales, glints of metal lead to leather straps and reins and on its back, just forward of the enormous wings that bore it into the air, sat a man in warm, heavy clothing, a breastplate on his chest and long, scaled skirts hanging down to cover both his legs and his mount’s wing-joints. An elaborately winged and plumed helmet rested on his head and a long spear in his hand, which he swung to point at Nolan and Giorgia, pulling his mount back as it looked at them with cold, reptilian eyes. Pulling down the scarf covering his face, he barked a command in a language neither of them knew, but still trembling from the horror, they lay face-down on the ground. Seemingly satisfied, the man took to the skies once again just as the sound of a thousand marching men in maile, heralded the arrival of infantry.

Prince Iakros, commander of the Fifth Legion, stood and raised his hands with a broad smile. The feast of his officers and first company filled the courtyard of the meager town’s citadel, lanterns and torches providing light as they drank and celebrated. His men were hardened veterans, at home on the battlefield, but no soldier existed who did not rejoice in an early return home, especially one in the wake of victory. And what a victory it was, to claim such a store of relic-weapons and plentiful slaves besides! The outlaws had provided a fine conclusion to another successful season. The feast grew silent without him needing to say a word, allowing their commander to speak.

“My unsurpassed legion,” he began, his voice carrying as well in the packed courtyard as on the battlefield, “My congratulations to you, the victors of the day and carriers of yet another grand campaign for our great empire!” He paused as the men raised a cheer to their own glory which could likely be heard in the town below, before continuing. “I especially commend Captain Osion Glysas of the Sixth Company for his swift action to destroy the nefarious bandits and outlaws that had encamped so close to this place and threatened our royal sister with their presence.”Klytea was seated beside him in the position of honor - an ordinarily laughable spot for a woman, but one afforded her first by her royal blood (as was right and proper) and secondly by her title as knight-commander (which was simply absurd). To compound the absurdity, she wore a crass mis-match of a knight’s doublet, boots, sash and sword-belt (without the weapon of course, this was feast, not a council of war) and a proper lady’s skirt and scarf. Doubtless she’d sought the glory of exterminating the rebels and outlaws left in the wake of his conquests herself and now had a face like she had bitten into a lemon at having her triumph snatched away from her. Well, that was the nature of battle and besides, it was no place for women playing at knighthood.

“Further,” he continued as the cheers for Osion calmed down, “I honor the hero of the day, Wingmaster Neytor Aegles and invite him to share his actions with all present, so that they may know his heroic deeds from the champion’s lips!”

Neytor rose proudly and saluted his commander and took to his story. The man was a dashing figure, with striking cobalt-blue hair more common in the western lands, where the old blood ran a touch stronger than the capitol, lean and a little smaller of stature, as befitted a soldier of the wyvernry. He was the scion of one of a minor noble family that had sided with the Empire early in its westward expansion and had served well enough to rise to the position of wingmaster, captain of the Fifth Legion’s wyvern-riders. Such a position carried expectations as much as prestige and today he had lived up to them fully.

“I will not speak of the first stoop and strike that tore into the enemy’s camp, nor of the chaos wrought for our brave cavalry to exploit, for that is the glory of my wing and of the horsemen,” he began, showing proper humility and deference to his comrades-in-arms. The display of virtue truthfully bored Iakros, but it was the correct thing to do at least. “As the cavalry charged, I circled the camp and made an end of the scum who thought to flee their just punishment until the infantry arrived. As I flew however, I saw lightning and smoke and heard the crack of thunder throughout the battle. Relic weapons, in the hands of bandits, raised to strike against imperial subjects!” He brought his hand down on the table making the places around him rattle. Iakros noticed the sixth company’s cavalry officer wince as Neytor told of the slaughter the rogue mages had wrought. Relic weapons were truly frightening to face, even on a personal level. Dozens of good men and horses were dead at the hands of the mages, who’s relics had cared little for hide nor steel, leaving small but deep wounds akin to invisible, all-piercing arrows.

“I saw one knot of the enemy in particular wreaking lamentable slaughter of our men and I felt my heart fill with the war-god’s own fury,” Neytor continued, raising his hand and demonstrating his dive. Iakros had to admit, the man made for quite the storyteller. He could almost see the ferocious wyvern and its fearless rider descending like Cenos’ wrath upon the enemy.

“They didn’t think to watch the skies and so we landed like a thunderbolt, crushing two at once and my lance taking a third in the chest!” Neytor declared triumphantly, chopping his hand down and lashing out as though his meat-knife was the lethal weapon in question. “One turned and his relic flashed, but though Shadow-of-blood felt pain, his scales held firm. I twisted in my saddle and my lance again found the mage’s heart!” He spread his arms wide as the story reached its climax. “Faced with my wyvern and I behind and the cavalry to the fore, the remainder knew no way to turn. Panic gripped them and their magic faltered. Like that, their resistance ended and soon after, their lives!”

The courtyard erupted into applause, even Kyltea’s ‘knights’ seated among them looking flushed at the tale of bravery and prowess. If Neytor played that well, perhaps one among them could end her foolish games as a proud wife of the day’s hero.

“Well told and better fought, Wingmaster!” Iakros declared, just as the cheering began to dull. “And for your valour I will see a silver ring on your arm when we return to Kasteo!” The cheering rose again as he continued. “You shall have your choice of the slaves, excepting the two mages who are the responsibility of the Academy. And if I do not miss my count, that is four rings to your name!” The roar of acclimation reached new heights as he declared, “Neytor Aegles, by my right as prince, Strategos of the West and commander of the Fifth Legion, I name you Champion of the Legions! Stand tall, Wingmaster and Champion!”

Iakros returned to his seat as his Wingmaster swelled with pride and basked in the congratulations of his peers. To win even a single ring for valor was an achievement; two, noteworthy; three all but guaranteed a soldier’s swift rise; and four demanded the highest recognition a soldier or junior officer could receive. To claim any higher glory, Neytor would need to command his own legion - a feat that may well be within his grasp as a champion and if he did, he would owe it to Iakros’ patronage, for there was little other way for the scion of such minor nobility, not even from the heartland of Renas, to aspire to command a legion.

The prince turned to his sister, slightly surprised to see her still looking as sour as ever. Was she truly that upset to have her prey snatched from her? Madness - the outlaws had cost him so many of his veteran cavalrymen, if Klytea’s ‘order’ of women pretending at knighthood had attacked without air support or even infantry to hide behind, they would have been slaughtered! If anything, the ungrateful girl should be thanking him for saving her! As Iakros frowned, the truth dawned on him however. The silly girl had just heard how a cavalry charge swept through the outlaw camp and a single hero’s actions helped carry the day. Of course she didn’t understand the consequences of her foolishness - he was simply acting out the very stories she wished to imitate!Perhaps she’d be served better by actually seeing the dead and wounded, like rubbing a disobedient pup’s face in its mess? Or maybe a tournament, her ‘knights’ losing to real warriors, would finally drive home that she was better forgetting her foolish dreams? …No, either way, it was hardly his responsibility to babysit his sister - that should have been their imperial father’s job, but instead he had indulged her hobby. It had been one thing when the Order of the Ram were merely strutting around the capitol as unusual ornaments of noble opulence, but the battlefield was *his* domain and he wouldn’t see it made a mockery of by silly girls playing games. Rather than a lesson, he would simply put a stop to this.

“Are you so certain they were outlaws?” Klytea asked as Iakros reached his decision. The prince’s eyebrows shot up at the very suggestion and he had to stifle a laugh to avoid embarrassing everyone present by making her question widely known.

“They flew no flag, nor showed any imperial sign,” he scoffed. “Not even the standards of any barbarian king. And they possessed enough relic weapons to kill three or four times their number, in spite of the speed of our attack and Neytor’s heroic actions. A gathering of armed mages in such numbers, under no banner? Tell me that does not sound like they plotted villainy and I’ll call you an even greater fool than you’ve thus far shown yourself.”

His sister bristled at the jab as he motioned for more wine. “And exactly what do you mean by that, *dear brother?”* she growled. Pretend knight or not, her pride was very real and were he not of her blood and a Strategos, she might well have challenged him to a duel there and then for the insult. But all the gods would curse a kinslayer, which any duel within a family carried a danger of and both Imperial law and chivalric custom disallowed challenging a military superior in matters of personal honor.

“I mean that it is time you ceased pretending to be a knight,” he replied bluntly. “A battlefield is no place for a maiden, no matter how much armor she wears. Our father may think it amusing to indulge your whims, but you’ve carried this too far. If the lives of your playmates are of no concern to you, then at least consider your own. Just look down and you’ll see why this fancy of yours insults the empire, your family and yourself. You’re not a child any longer, Klytea, so stop playing games and act as a woman should.”

His sister rested a hand on her bust as she glanced down, her face white with anger. For a few long seconds, Iakros hoped she would lash out, to give him a public and legal reason to dismiss her ‘order’. But Klytea swallowed and fixed him with a cold look. “I will retire to consider your words, Strategos.”

Damn. She’d called his bluff. As hollow as the title was, Klytea was still a knight-commander of a chivalric order and as such, he held no legal power over her, unless she in some way violated her oaths of fealty. Only an imperial edict could form or disband a knightly order and while he had the power to compel her on her oath to cooperate with his legions, he could not simply dismiss her. In the past, some unscrupulous strategoi had used that power to dispose of political rivals by ordering them into suicidal positions, but sending these women into battle was the exact *opposite* of what he wanted!

Iakros ground his teeth as Klytea rose, bowed stiffly and left with her back straight as a lance. Seeing their princess leaving and reading the prince’s dark expression, many of her lady-‘knights’ followed suit, excusing themselves and avoiding his gaze as they left.

Iakros beckoned to the prefect and raised his voice. “Since the gentler sex seems to be abandoning us, maybe it’s time for some damn entertainment!” he called. His men cheered and as the prefect’s steward ushered in some of the prettier harlots from the town, wearing very little indeed. Iakros smiled indulgently, but watched with only half an eye. Clearly he’d need to be less direct to dissuade Klytea of her foolishness.

The party did not last too much longer into the night, by simple fact that lamp-oil didn’t fall from the sky like rain and Iakros wanted his legion to march again in the morning. Still, it was well past dawn and into mid-morning by the time everyone had recovered from the festivities. Klytea was back in her gleaming armor, bronze edging polished so as to almost resemble gold. She and her ‘knights’ were lined up to see them off and Iakros had to admit, they looked good on parade. The exotic appeal of beautiful young women in armor was part of what had made them the talk of high society and the capital’s darlings. That fame no-doubt led to their ridiculous pride and belief that being fashionable somehow translated into being equal to real knights.

“Safe travels, Strategos,” Klytea said, saluting him as a stable-hand brought his destrier. “I’m sure the Fifth Legion will find a warm welcome at Kasteo.” He could tell she was still smarting from the previous night, referring to him by his rank, rather than as her brother. Well if she was displeased now, she’d be even less happy in a moment.

“Most of us will, but the Seventh Company will remain in Baeloe,” he shrugged. “To… Assist our valued allies, the knights of the Ram.”

Klytea looked like he’d slapped her and Iakros tried not to take too much satisfaction in the confusion, fury and disgust that flickered across her face. “I- You can’t do this,” she hissed, immediately regretting her words as he smiled back smugly.

“I think you’ll find I can and have, ‘Knight-commander.’ The Fifth Legion’s Seventh Company will remain stationed in Baeloe with orders to ‘assist’ the Order of the Ram in *every regard.* I gave the orders last night after you left the feast. I trust you understand that as Strategos of the Western Legions, I am fully within my rights to assign troops to wheresoever I believe to be of strategic importance and when they are attached to an ally to ‘assist’ them, the correct response from said ally…” He leaned closer with a triumphant smile, “Is to *thank* the strategos for his *consideration* and affirm the order’s *sworn oath and commitment to the empire.* Do we understand each other?”

Klytea looked like she’d far rather claw his eyes out than do any such thing, but she pressed her fist to her heart and hissed her reply. “*Thank you,* Strategos, for your consideration. The Order of the Ram stands ever-ready to serve the empire alongside its brave legions.”

“Good girl,” he smirked, straightening up and mounting his waiting horse with a swirl of his scarlet cape. Looking back down, not only his sister, but every woman close enough to have heard their exchange was glaring *daggers* at him, not that the fury of a few women bothered him. The Seventh Company’s ‘assistance’ was of course, nothing of the sort. There was nothing in writing, of course, but a quick word with Captain Ableos was enough to make his subordinate understand that his men were to be simultaneously as omnipresent, as interfering and as unhelpful as possible. The Order of the Ram wouldn’t be able to do a damn thing without tripping over his legionaries ‘helpfully’ placing themselves exactly where they were neither needed, nor wanted. At the very least, it would completely frustrate the order’s every attempt to put themselves where they could accidentally accrue some undeserved glory and at best, his men would enflame these silly girls pride to the point that they would disgrace themselves and give him the perfect excuse to have them thrown out of his region with a stain on their honor and sufficient cause to request the emperor disband them.

The best part? His sister knew what he was doing and there wasn’t a damn thing she could do to stop it. Iakros smiled to himself as he led his legion from the citadel, through the meager town and out of the gates. No-one ever credited him with much political acumen and he would readily admit it was a field he had no talent and less interest in, but every so often, it was satisfying to surprise someone.

Lewis stood and bowed as Princess Klytea entered his… Cell? Room? Whatever he should call the comfortable chamber he hadn’t been permitted to leave. He supposed it was at least nicer than having to sit in some dingy dungeon room with bars across the window. And if he *could* go, where *would* he go? Back to the base camp? He’d been so thoroughly rattled by the ride here that he wasn’t totally sure which way that even was.

Leusa was immediately behind the princess, bringing the magical translation tool, along with the crazy blonde who’d been responsible for bringing him in the day before. As the mage set up the device however, Lewis looked over the two armored girls and felt a stirring of worry in his gut. The princess had rushed out yesterday in a great hurry, so clearly something was up, but now the look on her face was calling out to his first responder’s instincts that something was very, *very* wrong. It wasn’t helped by the other blonde looking somewhere between ill and murderous, her fingers gripping the vambrace of her other arm so tightly, he was amazed she wasn’t leaving dents!

“It’s ready. Did you rest well, Lewis?” Leusa asked as the chain glowed once again.

“I’ve slept in worse conditions,” he replied, truthfully. After eighteen hours fighting a chemical fire, half the men there were falling asleep standing up. “Dinner wasn’t too bad either, but hey, sounded like everyone else was having a good old party. Don’t suppose you saved me any leftovers?”

His smile faltered and broke against the stony silence that greeted his joke and he cleared his throat awkwardly, adopting a more serious tone. “Uh- Your highness, if I may be permitted to ask, has something happened? Because you look wound tighter than a spring- Uh, a windlass? Bowstring?” He corrected himself after his first analogy elicited a blank look from Leusa.

The two lady-knights exchanged a look, then the princess stepped forward and bowed her head to him. Okay, he wasn’t totally up to speed on royal protocol, but that gesture alone made his gut feeling boil into full-blown indigestion.

“Her highness apologizes for being the bearer of dire news,” Leusa relayed to him, her own face still as serious and calm as ever, even as Klytea looked like she was going to be sick. “She swears upon her honor as a knight and by her royal blood that she had no knowledge of her brother’s actions-”

“Whoa whoa, stop, your brother?” Lewis blinked, raising his voice a little to be heard over both talking women, a knot of panic quickly unfolding the more they both said. “Dire news? What the bloody hell’s going on? What’s happened?!”

Klytea looked into his eyes and drew a deep breath. “\[My brother is Prince Iakros Kladmanes Pelna, strategos of the Western Legions and Commander of the Fifth,\]” she said via Leusa. “\[Yesterday, mistaking them for outlaws, his legion attacked and over-ran the Order of Ahzeeg. He claimed that they were armed with many relic-weapons and intended harm to the empire’s subjects. You have abided by your word of honor and have mine in turn that no harm shall come to you, but it is right that you should know that many of your comrades have been regrettably slain and many more taken into bondage as slaves of the legion.\]”

Lewis felt his vision swim and his hand fell from his throat, breaking the magical connection as he slumped forward in his chair. It felt like a stone had been dropped into his stomach as the otherworlders continued to make indistinguishable sounds in their alien language. ‘Many’ dead. ‘Many more’ enslaved. Those words hid the horror of what had likely gone down and that he’d only been spared by dumb luck… Or worse, what if his capture had somehow set the events in motion? No, that made no sense, even though he knew that thought would torment him for weeks to come.

The world snapped harshly back into focus as Leusa took his hand, looking into his eyes with professional concern in hers. A part of him dimly thought she’d make a decent paramedic or nurse with her mix of clinical professionalism and genuine compassion, before he pushed that thought away and put his fingers to his throat once more, coughing and clearing his airway a few times before nodding to her to re-initialize the connection.

“Are you alright? Do you need some water?” was her first question, pre-empting her princess. Lewis shook his head and she gave a small sigh of relief, before returning to her duty as a translator. “The princess wishes you to know that if your people have any particular funerary customs, she will do her best to see them carried out in accordance with your wishes.”

He shook his head, taking a deep breath as another horror slowly dawned on him and he looked up at them with a gaunt expression. “No- I… I need to g-get back to base camp, I-I have to send word back through the gate!”

Leusa and Klytea exchanged a confused look, before the princess nodded sympathetically. “\[I understand needing to see it with your own eyes,\]” she told him gently, “\[Taking you there may be more problematic than you might think, but as a favor, I will see it done somehow. Likewise, if you fear for any of your countrymen who might follow you, I will do my best to extend my protection to them, but my brother has left a company of troops here to frustrate any actions by my order.

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.



I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

1ldtlxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/kootenays/comments/1ldtlxn/looking_for_needles_in_a_haystack/,Looking for needles in a haystack,"I never thought I’d be this guy. But I’m new to BC from the states. I am inherently introverted, but socially competent. I just chose to be by myself most of the time. And this worked well when I lived in big city. But in rural BC, I can see some limitations.

So now I’m that guy on the internet looking for friends. I am 55 years old, married and interested in:

Music. I am an amateur drummer for the last 30 years. I find something to love in almost every musical genre. From bebop to noise rock, sludge metal, Joanna Newsom. I’m all over the map. I haven’t played regularly with anyone in years, but would love to play some version of chaotic, loud, driving metal or hard rock again. I miss breaking sticks and feeling amps push air through my body. 

Mountain biking. BMX biking at skateparks and pump tracks. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being expert level, I’m probably hovering around 2, maybe 3 on a good day if the wind is right. I’m average for my age I think. 

Coffee. I don’t know what came over me. But the last few years I lived in Portland Oregon, I really grew to love a great cappuccino. I am excited every time I get a new bag of coffee for my Moka Pot. I wake up early and love the ritual. Pairs well with drumming and BMX riding.

Leftist politics. My wife and moved for a variety of reasons. But MAGA part 2 was a confirmation for us that America is descending into some form of fascism that we don’t want to be a part of. I’m open to apolitical or even conservative points of view. But most conservative folks are not happy to hear my opinions. That’s the reason I feel compelled to mention my politics. 

LGBTQ. I’m queer, or bi, or just myself. I am most comfortable around queer community even though I’m happily married to a woman I love deeply for over 20 years now. When somebody asked Sandra Bernhard about her sexual orientation, she replied that she was “sophisticated”. I loved that. And I mention this because I don’t want to spend any more of my life not being who I am, or defending myself or other’s right to exist. 

Oh. I’m also a retired plumber. That fits.

So, any queer friendly, middle aged metal heads who love fancy coffee, appreciate the skilled trades, and love All About Eve and Liza with a Z? 
It’s a fucked situation for an introverted complicated person up here. But it’s important for my mental health that I put myself out there. It is not comfortable for me. So maybe I’m doing something right. ",10,1750182057.0,kootenays,7,0.92,False

Now, a major disclaimer, I have adhd, so I gave myself the additional 50% I would have on the actual test, which allowed me to pause I absent mildly used this feature to stand up and drink my coffee and use the rest room a few times this certainty gave me a slight advantage(tell me if its like a major major advantage), as this may have allowed me to destress just a bit ( i did not think about problems at all during my break as I did this only if I had finished a problem). I feel stupid for not realizing that during the test. However, I did not notice myself getting any less stressed when I paused. I often would come back more stressed because I would drink more caffeine and be more cracked out. Also, the section I did this most often is the section I scored the worst in Logical reasoning, 18/26. Its just to say that while I feel stupid for not catching this and I feel like I need to tell yall I do honestly dont think it contributed a huge amount( tell me wrong if it did just be kind <3), to be honest but if means my score is worthless all I ask is that you be kind this was not a cocky thing or on purpose it was an absent minded mistake. I took the first practice exam on Law Hub, which was 140. Are all Lawhub practice tests roughly equal or do they scale up in difficulty? Anyway, my goal was a 155, so I think no matter what, I am happy with my result.I just want to double-check that I did not confuse something here and round down my score to 165.

1ldth87,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ldth87/i_think_the_world_ended_can_someone_please_confirm/,I Think the World Ended. Can Someone Please Confirm?,"I hope someone is reading this. It is my strong suspicion that humanity ended about a week ago. If that is the case, I am posting this in the hopes that I am not the last survivor. Please send help, I have no idea how much longer I’ll hold out.

I should mention that I was born without my sight. It’s been a challenge for me. The world we’ve built is one dominated by the ability to see. Education, roads, even most forms of entertainment are predominantly experienced through the eyes. 

People have often asked me what it’s like to be blind, but that’s difficult for me to describe. It’s just how I am. I like to think that it has allowed me to experience the world in a way that few others do. I can appreciate my other senses to a degree that makes life just as beautiful for me as for anyone else. Or as terrifying.

Believe it or not, I work as an author. My setup allows me to use speech to text and even reads my work back to me so I can correct it. I truly enjoy writing. It lets me paint pictures that I can experience the beauty of. 

That being said, it is a very lonely life. I don’t really have too many friends, save the cleaning lady who gives my apartment a one-over every month. It’s to my shame that I admit, I’ve gone for months without leaving my apartment before. I didn’t really see any need for me to.

I get all the fresh air I need when I drink my coffee on the balcony, and it’s not like natural beauty does anything for me. But I do so love the sounds. The birds singing, the wind blowing through leaves, even the sound of traffic. It makes me appreciate that life is happening all around me. I often felt like the Hunchback of Notre Dame - stuck in my tower while the world goes on below me. Only I chose my prison. 

As a result, I’ve given myself an unofficial mandate that I must go outside at least once every day for a short walk. I think it keeps me not just sane, but also it helps me be happier. 

Another way I avoid depression is a routine. Even if it is a loose one, I find it helps keep my life structured. 

I wake up at 7am and eat breakfast on my balcony. It’s one of my favorite parts of the day. I soak in the world around me - the wind brushing over my skin, the birds chirping back and forth to each other in their busy escapades, the smell of the bakery from the street below - it’s when I feel most alive. 

After that, I shower, get dressed and begin work at 8:30. I spend the rest of my morning wrestling with writer's block or brainstorming for my next chapters, and then take a break around noon to have a small lunch and go on that walk I mentioned earlier. Then, it’s back to writing at 1:30. I usually continue on until around 5, which is when I make myself dinner. After dinner I unwind by listening to audiobooks or podcasts. That, or sometimes I’ll put a movie on. 

As you may have gathered, I experience this world differently than most. For example, I can’t just look at the sky and see a storm. I feel when the clouds are ready to pour down rain on the earth, I smell the weight of it in the air, and I hear the subtle change in the wind's voice, the way it hushes like the sky is holding its breath. 

I’ve always lived my life this way, and I wouldn’t change it. But recently something has been off.

I noticed it 13 days ago when I was eating my breakfast. It was a sunny day, and the wind blew gently through my hair. But the smell of it was odd. It had a hint of almost a medical smell. Like formaldehyde. I didn’t have time to dwell on it before a melody of chirps sprung out closer to me than usual. A robin was singing its flute-like song for me. I smiled - it was truly a special way to start my day.

My walk that day was also a bit odd, only in the sense that cars seemed more aggressive than normal. The sound of engines revving and horns beeping seemed more common. I could hear people talking too. Someone walked by me, asking their partner about dinner on the phone. Another pair was standing not far away, talking about the weather. Yet another was discussing some meeting they had at work. All perfectly mundane and normal things.

What bothered me at this point was the smell. It was not the usual smell of the lake and the trees. Everything was tainted with a chemical smell. And something else - something masked by it. Like if you were to microwave raw chicken until it was just hot enough to produce an aroma. 

I showered after I got home, trying to scrub the stench off of me. But I didn’t let it bother me, the rest of my day went as it normally does. 

As did my morning the next day. I woke up and prepared my breakfast, dusting off the chair on the balcony. The wind was just a bit rougher today. Yet, dry. It was not unpleasant enough for me to go inside. I couldn’t smell the bakery that morning, but I was able to enjoy the sounds I usually do. Cars rushed by, people chattered below, and the robin even sang his song for me again.

I worked, I ate, I went for a walk. But I almost considered cutting it short. The smell was getting worse, its mask was slipping off. I could make out the faint scent of burnt hair now too. 

Up until now, I was not particularly bothered. The following is what sent me into my steep slide into paranoia:

The conversations I heard. Someone asked their partner about dinner. Someone was discussing the weather. Someone was complaining about a meeting. The same voices, the same tones, the same cadences. 

I stopped to listen, but the conversations all sounded normal to me. A car jolted me back to my senses - 3 quick beeps from the road ahead. I smirked to myself - everyone was always in such a hurry. 

I talked myself down on the way home - these were all normal conversations. Very common and not unreasonable that people discussed them. After all, I didn;t memorize anyone's voice. Who’s to say it was the same people.

And yet the next day - the robin with his same tune, dinner, weather, work, 3 beeps. 

The next day, the day after, and the day after.

I even changed my routine. I ate dinner inside, but I could still hear the bird clear as day from my window. 

I walked another path, yet I heard the same voices, the same mundane conversations. 

Five days ago, I tried something else. I left the house at 4 am, before dawn. No breakfast. No routine. Just a coat, my cane, and silence.

I walked through streets I hadn’t stepped on in years - quiet side roads, fenced-off alleys, industrial zones. And still I heard it.

The robin singing. Not distant. Close.

“What’s for dinner?” a woman asked, passing behind me. Calm, casual.

“This fog is terrible,” a man replied on my right. “Supposed to clear by noon.”

Yet another, “My boss is riding me about that meeting again.”

The voices never overlapped. Each one waited their turn like actors in a scene. The pauses between them - identical every time.

Then 3 honks just ahead of me.

I ran home and locked my doors and windows, but it didn't change anything. I still hear the robin everyday like clockwork. I can even hear the 3 honks on the street below when their time comes.

I haven’t left my apartment yet. 

But yesterday, I was fumbling around the living room and knocked something off the shelf - my old radio. It hasn’t worked in years. It fell, cracked, and let out a brief burst of static.

Then the robin stopped singing. 
The traffic fell silent.
The busy chattering from pedestrians vanished without a trace. 

And in their place, new noises.

Wind - not gentle, but howling, pushing and scraping against the building like claws.

Distant crackling - like fire chewing through dry wood, or the brittle remains of something once alive.

And beneath it all, a deep rumble. Not mechanical - geological.

The city groaned.

Not with life, but with pressure. As if its bones were shifting under the weight of their own collapse.

I heard something metal fall - far off, a sign or streetlamp, maybe. It struck the ground and didn’t stop ringing.

There were no footsteps. No laughter. No voices.

Only the wind, and the ruins left for it to gnaw on.

It lasted only seconds, but it was enough for me to take it all in. The picture these sounds painted sickened me to my core. 

Then, like a machine sputtering back to life, the robin returned. Then the cars and the conversations - drowning out the sounds of emptiness in a deafening juxtaposition. 

All of it came back, just like before. Perfect. Polished. Rehearsed.

But what they couldn’t keep from me is the smell. Warm, rancid flesh and sour, acidic chemicals hidden behind the smell of pastries and fresh bread.

Now I sit here, on the balcony, coffee in hand, pretending the world is still alive.

The robin sings on cue.

The conversations start in order.

The smells drift up from a bakery I’m sure no longer stands.

But I know now.

Whatever’s out there wants me to believe.

To follow my routine.

And most days, I do.

My wife and just came back from a 3-week trip to central and northern Italy. We rented a car for the whole time and stayed in air-BNBs. I wanted to provide a list of some observations and advice for those going in the future. These are merely opinions and not fact. If I offend anyone, I apologize. This is not my intention. We stayed in Florence, Montalcino, Lake Como, the Chianti Region and Orvieto.

 

* Tipping – it’s alive and sometimes expected. One restaurant even asked how much tip we want to leave on check-out. It was even expected in a Michelin-starred restaurant and not just tourist places.
* Some menus are in Italian only. Use Google Lens.
* Roads are scary – I mean scary at times. There are tons of roundabouts. When in cities, many roads are either two-way (but are so narrow it seems impossible) or one-way, and it’s sometimes not obvious which way they go. Many roads also have tons of people walking on them and you have navigate around them.
* No chicken in pasta – More than 1 chef pointed this out.
* No chicken parm – I guess it an American thing. Don’t ask for it.
* Don’t ask for olive oil with your bread. Most places don’t do it. I think it’s the tourist places that do.
* So many people dress like an American tourists. Don’t be that guy. No flip flops, logo tee-shirts, stretchy pants, hats, cargo shorts. Unless you’re happy advertising your American. In which case you’re more of a target for scams.
* Italians don’t dress up as much as I thought. I was expecting nice clothes all the time. They dress like anyone else.
* Every restaurant we went to allowed for shorts. Doesn’t mean it's right. I wore pants every meal, but felt like the minority amongst tourists.
* Wear good shoes (we averaged about 10k steps a day on cobblestone)
* The plumbing is not very good. Things clog. Water pressure if often poor.
* Showers are tiny. They are like 24-30” square.
* Double beds are really queen-size beds. I was freaking out that every place we booked said double-bed which would be very difficult with two people. Not to fret. Every bed we had was a queen.
* Italians drive crazy. They will tailgate you like you’ve never seen in the U.S. They will flash their brights and honk if you’re going to slow. Plan on pulling off to the side to let them pass.
* ZTL zones – these are restricted areas where non-resident traffic is forbidden. Avoid at all costs, as you may receive a multi-hundred-dollar fine in the mail.
* Some people refuse to speak English. Some are in the service industry and in big cities and act like they don’t understand you. You will do a lot of pointing of what you need.
* The gelato is phenomenal.
* You will pay more for certain things (if you eat at a table outside versus having at the bar counter. Such as coffee and croissants.
* Parking meters are hard to figure out. The first time using one I spent like 30 minutes trying to figure it out. You generally need to add coins or your credit card first.
* Try and learn a little Italian. Even please, thank you, hello/bye, where’s the bathroom? It goes a long way.
* Aperol Spritz is your friend. Such an awesome cocktail.
* Many restaurants charge a cover charge of $2-$4 per person. This is non-negotiable.
* Most restaurants let you have a drink without needing to add food. Great for late afternoon cocktails when you don’t need to eat anything.
* Water is not free in restaurants. It all comes from the bottles. Sparkling water is everywhere. But most restaurants ask you if you want sparkling or regular.
* You don’t need to eat a Primi (1^(st) course) and a Secondi (2nd course) plates. We rarely had both because it’s a ton of food.
* The wine is fantastic with a much smaller markup than in the US (especially house wine, which can be had for a few dollars per liter).
* No American coffee. Don’t ask. Be happy with an espresso or a cappuccino.
* It is an unwritten law that cappuccino should not be drunk after 11am.
* Everywhere takes credit card. But buying small items should be cash. I feel bad using a card for like $3 items.
* Some public bathrooms cost money. Usually one Euro. So have some coins on hand.
* Many public bathrooms don’t have toilet seats, which was very weird. Hopefully you don’t need to sit.

 That’s about all I can think. I hope this list is helpful to someone.",5,1750181580.0,ItalyTravel,17,0.69,False

**Autumnhollow:**

In front of the gazebo, a table had been laid out and Philia, Zefir, Siria, Viel, Peanut, and Selphie, were all working together to perform enchantment on the last set of Traveler’s Valises for the mice who have yet to have them; enhancing the bags’ original capacity as well. Once they were finished, they just needed Cecil to bring them to his room so that Qhethar’s blessing would cause it to double.

A larkirk pigeon materialized as it flew into the territory of Autumnhollow. Siria held out her hand and the bird perched on it. Siria took a few moments to unhitch the knapsack around the bird's back and patted its head before letting it fly away.

Siria cast a spell to ensure there wasn't anything nasty inside. Inside were a few sealed cylinders bearing letters, she handed them over to Zefir so he could read them, being the most junior of all the spellcasters.

""This one's for Philia."" Zefir said, his eyes scanning the contents ""it's a letter from the Night Hawks...""

""That's the underground in Elion-Nosco."" Philia explained.

Zefir took the rolled up letter from the cylinder. He quickly scanned his eyes on the paper and read aloud. It was to the effect that Philia’s underground contacts had heard of a rumor that a few chapters of the Guileheads had indeed taken residence in the town of Irons and they were indeed being financed by some local lord to serve as his enforcers-in-shadow. As Zefir finished reading, Philia shrugged.

“It’s been only a week at most…” she began, the bag she was working on had a scroll underneath it. The glowing runes shifted from one complex figure after another, forming a magic circle around the bag while the rest began crawling up it.

“...there’s no way the Guileheads would have known that Irons has been gassed with Sarin,” she continued, “...much less the Night Hawks. The one who should start to notice something’s happened in Irons would be the merchants heading to the town… if they’re connected to the guileheads there’s a chance they might get spooked and just avoid going there from now on, meaning they won’t report it.”

 

The next letter was from the Fenrir Guild. Guildmaster Tibbles had provided a letter of confidentiality to be presented to the Jormungandr Guild. This LoC was to the effect that The Whales were now given a priority warehouse and a mandate from the Jormungandr guild to keep any and all sales confidential. The rewards will be the same as usual but now any and all “excess” loot would now be attributed to the guild, thus sparing the team from any scrutiny.

“How thoughtful he wants to keep things secret.” Zefir said.

“Tephrans have a genetic dislike for organized crime.” Philia told him “It’s in their history…besides there’s much for the guild to gain if we take down a big syndicate like the Guileheads. It’s a win-win. We don’t get harassed by obnoxious aristrocrats wanting to use us as their private army, and the Fenrir get all the glory while we get the gold.”

“Don’t forget…” Siria added “Guilds are generally neutral towards inter-kingdom politics…”

Zefir nodded.

 

The third letter was a certificate from the Veles Royal Treasury with the King's Seal authorizing the Royal Bank to pay upon demand a high amount of money to any bonafide member of the Whales.

Zefir looked up “I wonder where this came from…” the name wasn’t familiar to him.

“Probably one of the people we rescued from the guileheads…” Viel answered as she got to work on the next gun. “Or it could be one of the adventurers we saved in the dungeons.”

The next few letters were private and Zefir stuffed them back into the pigeon bag. One cylinder bore the sender’s name as Amaduscia Enthana to Kvaris and Retem Enthana.

“Retem Enthana?” Zefir frowned.

“Kinu’s legal name.” Philia said with absolute certainty.

“Garms, when it comes to twins, usually have one of them adopt an ancestor’s name during their childhood, it’s their custom.” Siria chimed in, “Kinu probably preferred to keep it.”

“Officially that would make our Kinu as Retem ‘Kinu’ Enthana to disambiguate her from any other Kinu Enthanas out there.” Viel added, then realizing that Zefir was an otherworlder and not as thoroughly knowledgeable, continued with “Incidentally, never call Kinu by the name of Retem unless she broaches the subject. It’s very rude. Garm culture is very particular about the name they use. Only in very select situations can you use it around her… such as a complete stranger asking who that letter is addressed to.”

“Welp, that’s news to me.” Zefir said.

 

It was at that point that Nod had met with the sylvant mice.

“All mice, prepare to board Overlord’s dimension!” Ingrid excitedly said over the radio. Like the larkirk pigeon earlier, she appeared out of thin air as she entered the house’s border, dressed in her maid outfit. The showy maid’s dress broke down into dark particles while a second set of glowing motes quickly coalesced around her body, taking on the form of her drow Solenrala ensemble.

 

The Whale’s mages continued on with their work, listening to the conversation and providing their input regarding sylvant mice.

“So that’s like what… forty mice now?” Siria inquired. Viel was quickly counting off with her fingers, mentioning the mice by name.

“...then there’s Connor, Abel, Byron, Bagley, Adam, Gren, and Eric… yes, forty mice.” Viel said.

“We don’t have enough guns unless you’re fine with them using unenchanted ones, Starchaser” Philia added, “I imagine you will draw umbrage at the idea of just adding them to our adventuring party as is.”

“There’s still Loreia’s \[Sally Pot\]...” Peanut squeaked.

“Ooooh!!!” Philia, Viel, and Siria suddenly chorused.

*“\[Sally Pot\]?”* Ingrid asked, *“You mean that witch cauldron that came from the Grand Halos’ arcane station?”*

Philia, Siria, and Viel giggled.

“It’s not for mixing potions,” Philia began, “It’s a modified version of a \[Siege Cauldron\] where instead of opening up a temporary wormhole to pour boiling oil or rocks through, you have a small squad jumping in and taking on people by surprise.“

*“Whoa!”* Ingrid exclaimed, *“A mobile machicolation?”*

“Yes.” Siria replied, “Back in the day they just called it magic machicolation.”

“Accursed machicolation, probably, if you were the besiegers.” Philia chuckled. The elf joined her.

“Ooohh…!” Cecil nodded, “Wait, so this \[Sally Pot\] is like a sally port!”

“It’s an artifact from the Amalna Empire that existed a thousand years ago…” Siria explained “It was quite common too. With \[Siege Cauldrons\] acting as, as you say a ‘mobile machicolation’ and \[Sally Pots\] allowing defenders to catch the assault teams by surprise, nobody thought that one day Amalna would ever collapse. It did…”

Philia, Siria, Viel, and Peanut sighed in unison.

\_\_\_

**Charcuterie Zerial, Teth-Odin:**

“Is this some Library of Baghdad shit?” Ingrid grimaced, realizing the implications of what the elf said.

*“Yeah…”* Philia grumbled *“Their capital was razed to the ground, and its grand libraries left a mountains of ashes so big that it would make the Nazis blush. What knowledge we have in regards to getting Peanut’s \[Sally Pot\] to work exists only from very few books written by foreign mages.”*

*“Unfortunately...”* Peanut added, *“With Loreia’s passing, we’re going to have to pore through her notes, and we need to be very thorough with it. Even back in the day, the Amalnans recognized the dangers of having these magic tools used against them and… let’s just say whoever tries to use it improperly would be lucky if they just teleported in the wrong spot..”*

“Don’t worry, we don’t need to put our sylvants to adventuring work tomorrow.” Ingrid said calmingly “They’ve probably been living rough for a while so they should relax for a bit, Baseplate, King Fish, will you help me install some TV’s into the crafting room? Glados? I think we still got some spares?”

“*We do.*” Neith replied, “*And I recommend Overlord take his giant hamster wheel out of his dimension and put in the crafting room as well.*”

“Sure!” Cecil squeaked.

Ingrid and Cecil leaned back against the railing of the terrace of the charcuterie. It was located across the street from where Zarael lived, and was run by his grandson Zerial. The establishment was mostly a delicatessen, with most customers coming over there to buy prepared meat, fish, pickles, and cheeses to bring home to make into their own sandwiches or other meals. The “dining” section was more like a no-service, no-frills terrace where people ate their meals after it was assembled at the counter.

The mice ate their sandwiches and cheese with gusto, squeaking and chittering happily. A sight that ended up drawing more customers, the sight of so many adorable familiars, the fact that they were liking the food which to many people was a testament to the charcuterie’s reputation, and how the mice conducted themselves; despite chomping away with their mouths open did not denigrate into fighting for more morsels. As a matter of fact, the mice were more keen into pushing more sandwiches towards the sylvant mice, which led to to grateful mice rubbing cheeks and hugging the others in thanks.

Ingrid and Cecil listened to the mages’ exegesis regarding the \[Sally Pot\] with interest. Ingrid’s elbow rested on the tall pub table where her and Cecil’s sandwich and cheese slices lay, along with a minty hookah that Cecil was enjoying.

“How does it work?” Ingrid inquired, there was something the girl’s hadn’t mentioned yet, “How do you decide where it opens up this wormhole?”

*“You’ll need to pair it to some specialized thrown objects.”* Philia replied, *“Historians say for \[Siege Cauldrons\], they use something like a boomerang; someone tosses it in the air then activates the spell. From there, the boomerang-thingy hovers in place and opens up the portal which then disgorges the cauldron’s contents. When the wormhole ends the boomerang retains its trajectory and flies back as usual”*

“Boomerangs?” Ingrid chuckled, taking the proffered stem from Cecil “Guess we have another case of divergent evolution.”

*“For that \[Sally Pot\], Loreia would just enchant thrown hunting sticks,”* Peanut continued for Philia, *“...I would help a lot in the process by the way. These hunting sticks aren’t meant to return but designed to travel as far as possible. The spell on the \[Sally Pot\] is only temporal, so you only have a few moments before everyone who jumps into the pot is sent back. As a result, there is no fear of losing the stick to an enemy.”*

“A one-way stick and a temporary assault team…” Cecil mused, “Yeah, I can imagine why this is such a great tool for defending the Amalna Empire.”

*“The other great thing is that it also shields those who enter the pot.”* Siria chimed in, *“No one’s ever died from using a \[Sally Pot\] because once the shielding fades it immediately recalls the soldier. In our case… They would need to overcome all our arcane defenses first since the \[Sally Pot\]’s shield is on the lowest priority.”*

“Sounds pretty powerful,” Cecil remarked, puffing out the smoke from top of his head like a whale’s blowhole. “Nobody really gets hurt? No wonder the Amalna Empire’s enemies were so salty after they finally stormed the capital.”

Ingrid was puffing deep in thought, oblivious to some customer staring and giving them the impression of a fire-breathing dragon. Instead of the rumbling sound of an agitated hundred-foot lizard, it was the sound of bubbling water as air rushed through the bowl and was filtered through the fluid-filled jar, the bubbling blue fluid turning a luminous green and stirring up the various herbs and fruits as the bubbles wiggled the surface.

“So if these newcomer mice were able to use it, they'd be able to jump in and start cutting down the enemy from the inside?” Ingrid inquired, she could imagine someone throwing a projectile right into the middle of a crowd of monsters and the mice would catch them by surprise, hacking away with their bardiches.

“*They could.*” Peanut said, “*We’ve used that tactic in the past to catch enemies by surprise.*”

“We should put another order for auto-shotguns then.” Cecil said, shivering a bit. The hookah’s vapors were pleasantly cold, causing him more than once to reach out a tendril and touch the liquid jar of the hookah and found it chilly, with beads of condensation constantly forming, hence the woven coaster placed underneath.

“Agreed,” Ingrid said, “What’s stopping anyone from using a \[Sally Pot\] as a \[Siege Cauldron\]?”

“*The sallying party does need a specialized amulet or similar for them to wear.*” Peanut explained, “*This allows them to pass through the portal the pot generates. We’ve once tried to throw objects sheathed in magic through the pot but it wouldn’t work.*”

“*Nor has there been any literature of \[Sally Pots\] being backwards compatible.*” Philia added. “*Can’t have everything…*”

“Speaking of not having everything…” Cecil said “If our sylvant mice will be guarding the crafting room, then they won’t be able to use the pot at all.”

“Not necessarily…” Peanut said.

Ingrid and Cecil could feel the smile forming on Philia’s face.

“Go ooon…” Cecil encouraged.

“Loreia would hand the amulet to a designated stick-thrower. This allows the cauldron to be used at some distance…” Peanut said, “What I’m trying to say is, considering that the mice are a swarm and all but one are able to enter Overlord’s dimension then it stands to reason that our sylvant mice can fulfill both being guards and part of a surprise strike team.”

“Now we’re talking…” Ingrid smiled “Since Kitty-Five said their magus is providing the sylvants additional protection via that stone drone, then I want them to stay as a single unit. We’ll table equipping them for now, let’s just take them in.”

\_\_\_

Nive and Vorque couldn’t believe their luck as they sat at the charcuterie terrace, smoking their hookah as they enjoyed their coffee. They were in the middle of staking out of Zerial’s establishment to see if any of the Whales would come by and visit when Ingrid reappeared again, this time with the Ancient Slime with her and seeing a prodigious forty mice pouring out of the slime’s portal.

The human was still passing off as a maid with her outfit, making her look like a house human on an errand to feed her master’s many familiars. However, the confident poise she made and the way she conferred with the Ancient One’s larva and how many of the mice gestured at her deferentially made it clear she was the pack’s alpha. The two cats had more than once on assignment been taken to the bowels of some black guild’s headquarters and talking to a barmaid who suspiciously acted like she owned the place, and in some cases, she either was or the boss’ daughter who preferred to keep an ear on the ground.

The mice’s loud squeaking as they gobbled up their food prevented the two cats from hearing what they were talking about, but Ingrid and the slime’s expression shifted between curious and serious.

She had seen them and raised her mug in greeting, the two cats did the same, but she did not approach, engrossed in her conversation with the slime.

It took the cats all of their training to not make any sudden movements at what they saw next. Both focused their mana into their eyes to get a good look at Ingrid. For someone who had caught them by surprise earlier that morning, she did not seem to radiate any powerful aura around her.

What they saw was some nightmarish fiend-owl roosting on her shoulder. Despite it’s initimidating appearance it merely cocked its head at them and let out a genteel hoot.

At once, both cats disengaged their mana vision. Ingrid was paying them no mind, as if her hitherto-unseen bird decided not to warn its master of someone looking into her aura.

“She has no aura.” Vorque said in a strained voice, with a slightly shaking paw, he took a deep draw of his hookah to calm himself.

“She’s very dangerous.” Nive said. “A Nemesis-Stalker you can’t even detect…”

“Excuse me…” A satyr staff member said as he handed the two a cup of hot chocolate each as well as a big sandwich filled with many slices of smoked, salted beef, followed by a complimentary bowl of pickled mushrooms. “The human bought these for you, enjoy.”

Ingrid waved at them and smiled.

Purring, the two cats took their plates and cup and joined the mice at the table. Ingrid glomped the two cats, purring happily. The two purred back and ruffled Ingrid’s hair.

“Nive and Vorque, right?” Ingrid asked quietly, the cats’ expression gave nothing away. They had not given their names earlier.

“Princess Philia Elion-Nosco is with me.” she said quietly. “Wanna come over for lunch?”

""And honestly? The kid's gonna be totally fine with River. You don't need to put yourself through some brutal custody war—especially when we both know how that's gonna end..............","Chapter 1  
The day after we finished dividing up the assets from our divorce, I got into a car accident and lost my memory. Later, my ex-husband River Kane tracked me down. He said if I stopped acting crazy all the time, maybe we could get remarried. I was mid-bite on my ice cream spoon and just froze. After a long pause, I finally managed: ""Uh, no thanks! I mean... I... I'm actually totally fine just keeping the money. I woke up to find my best friend Mackenzie staring at me with this super worried expression plastered all over her face. Hey, don't beat yourself up anymore, okay?"" she said, trying to sound all reassuring. Look, your body is your temple, babe. Even if you're going through this divorce mess, you still gotta live your best life. She sat down on the edge of my bed, fidgeting with her phone. ""And honestly? The kid's gonna be totally fine with River. You don't need to put yourself through some brutal custody war—especially when we both know how that's gonna end. I just stared at her, my brain feeling like it was wrapped in cotton. After what felt like forever, I finally managed to get the words out. ""Um... who the hell is River? Mackenzie froze mid-sentence, looking at me like I'd just spoken in tongues. It took her a hot minute to snap out of it before she bolted to get the doctor.  
The doctor said I had memory loss from the car accident. Mackenzie immediately jumped in, asking how old I thought I was. I said without any hesitation. ""Eighteen. Didn't I just finish my SATs yesterday? Mackenzie completely lost it. She literally crumpled to the floor, laughing so hard she was clutching her stomach and pounding the side of my hospital bed with her fist. Willa, oh my GOD! This amnesia thing is like... the universe giving you the ultimate do-over! Yes! You're eighteen, baby! Eighteen and free! No River, no kid, no drama... just you and me against the world! Now I was even more confused than before.Mackenzie took me back to her place once the doctors confirmed my memory probably wasn't coming back anytime soon. That's when she finally gave me the rundown on my apparently very messy life. Me—Willa Reynolds—fell head over heels for some broke college guy named River during freshman year. I spent ten whole years with this dude, from eighteen to twenty-eight. Stuck by him while he was building his empire from nothing, lived off ramen and dreams, popped out two kids for him, and basically became his family's live-in caretaker. And this year? He decided to divorce my ass. ""Wait, WHAT?"" I practically shrieked.  
  
This sounded like some tragic Lifetime movie bullshit.  
  
After I got over the initial shock, I asked in this shaky voice, ""So you're telling me I spent a decade being someone's unpaid servant, and then got kicked to the curb at twenty-eight?""  
  
Mackenzie nodded grimly. ""Yep. And you've got two kids—your son's six, your daughter's four. But since you were a stay-at-home mom with zero income, and the kids chose to stay with daddy, River got full custody.""  
  
""Hold up... so I lost the kids I spent years raising too?""  
  
Even though I couldn't remember any of this, it sounded absolutely terrifying. I was about to start ugly crying.  
  
Then Mackenzie's whole vibe shifted, and she actually smiled while patting my shoulder. ""Hey, don't look so miserable. At least you're loaded now.""  
  
I blinked back tears and asked cautiously, ""How loaded are we talking?""  
  
Mackenzie sat up straight, looking way too pleased with herself. ""Willa, listen carefully. You walked away with twenty percent of River's assets, ten percent stakes in three publicly traded companies, and two historic townhouses in Manhattan. We're talking about nine hundred million dollars.""  
  
Dead silence.  
  
I stared at her, then asked slowly, ""Mackenzie... you're not messing with me, right?""  
  
""If I'm lying, I'm literally a piece of shit.""  
  
That day, I spent hours just staring out the window at the sky.  
  
I'd lost ten years of memories. I had no clue what my life had been like during that time.  
  
But Mackenzie said I was rich as hell, and eighteen-year-old me had always been obsessed with money.  
  
So honestly? I guess this isn't too bad.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Mackenzie took time off work to help me sort through endless paperwork and property transfers.  
  
I never actually met this River guy—he had his lawyers handle everything in the divorce settlement.  
  
After nearly a month of bureaucratic hell, Mackenzie helped me list all my properties as rentals.  
  
She did the math and told me I'd be pulling in about one-twenty thousand a month just in rent.  
  
That day, staring at my bank account with more zeros than I could count, I looked up at the mirror. The reflection showed a perfectly put-together twenty-eight-year-old version of myself.  
  
I scratched my head. Wow. Not bad at all.  
  
I had nothing but time on my hands while Mackenzie went back to work, so I basically lived at her place playing video games all day.  
  
She'd order food for both of us during lunch breaks.  
  
Mackenzie worked insane hours and would come home looking like death warmed over, collapsing on the couch like a zombie.  
  
I'd put down my controller and give her shoulder rubs. Apparently muscle memory was still intact because I was surprisingly good at it.  
  
Once she'd recovered enough to form sentences, she'd start ranting: ""River is such a piece of shit. Right after you graduated, you were basically his unpaid intern. And when his mom got sick, you'd come home from work just to give her massages and take care of her.""  
  
Mackenzie kept going, then suddenly grabbed my head and flicked my forehead. ""Willa, you were such a pushover! The second I wasn't around, you let them walk all over you. That whole family treated you like garbage because they knew you didn't have anyone else.""  
  
I rubbed my forehead, feeling genuinely hurt. ""Hey, I don't remember any of that stuff! All I remember is you.""  
  
Mackenzie stopped mid-rant, then broke into a huge grin. ""You're right! You don't remember, and that's perfect. Just remember me—I'd never treat you like that.""  
  
I believed her completely, because Mackenzie and I grew up together.  
  
We were both foster kids.  
  
When we were little, I basically followed Mackenzie around everywhere. She'd fight other kids for snacks and help me with laundry.  
  
As we got older, she'd help me with homework. She was a year ahead of me, so when I was a senior, she was already in college, calling me every single day to keep me motivated.  
  
She wanted us to go to the same university, but Mackenzie was way too smart. Even when I studied my ass off, I couldn't get into Harvard like she did.  
  
The day our test scores came out, I just hugged her and cried.  
  
Mackenzie flicked my forehead again. ""What are you crying for? You got a 1480 on your SATs—that's amazing!""  
  
She ruffled my hair. ""You did great.""  
  
I ended up crying all the way to Boston for college.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Talking about it just made Mackenzie feel guilty all over again. ""I never should've let you go to Boston in the first place. If you hadn't gone to Boston, you never would've met River. If you'd never met River...""  
  
I jumped in with the obvious answer: ""Then I wouldn't have nine hundred million dollars.""  
  
Mackenzie put her hands on her hips. ""What's more important—the money or those ten years of your life?""  
  
I tried to guess the right answer: ""The money?""  
  
Mackenzie looked like she wanted to shake some sense into me. ""YOU'RE what's important! If you're miserable, all that money is worthless. Thank God you lost your memory, because if you remembered everything and did something stupid to yourself, what good would any of that money do?""  
  
""Well... it could buy me a really nice headstone...""  
  
Mackenzie cracked up despite herself. ""Oh my God, shut UP!""  
  
Mackenzie had always been incredible, and she still was. She was now a VP at some multinational corporation, pulling in around forty grand a month.  
  
But she was constantly swamped with work and business trips, and she worried about leaving me alone.  
  
So she started dragging me along everywhere. Eventually she figured if she had to babysit me anyway, why not put me to work?  
  
She got me hired as her assistant at her company.  
  
I was so ready for this! I'd spent months reading like fifteen different romance novels about powerful bosses falling for their assistants.  
  
On my first day, I strutted in wearing this killer business dress, feeling like I could take on the world.  
  
I made her coffee, organized her files, ran around doing errands.  
  
I was trying so hard to impress her that she finally started laughing and told me to chill. She handed me a spreadsheet and said, ""Have Ava show you the ropes on this. Take your time learning—no rush.""  
  
""Got it!""  
  
And just like that, I officially entered the workforce.  
  
I started following Mackenzie's schedule, but since I didn't have much on my plate, I usually got off work way earlier than her.  
  
Mackenzie, on the other hand, was buried in work. I'd hang out in the break room waiting for her to finish up every night.  
  
One day, Mackenzie caught me watching online tutorials on my phone and suddenly got serious. ""Willa, do you actually want to learn this stuff for real?""  
  
""Yeah... I really do.""  
  
With the memory loss, I was basically starting from zero at work. I kept screwing things up and it was getting pretty depressing.  
  
Mackenzie had always been my role model growing up, and that hadn't changed. I wanted to be as effortlessly competent as she was. She made everything look so easy and cool.  
  
So Mackenzie enrolled me in classes. After work every day, I'd drive to night school.  
  
I took project management courses mixed with software training programs.  
  
I filled up two entire notebooks before things finally started clicking. Oh, that's how it works!  
  
When I finished that program, Mackenzie signed me up for accounting and finance classes.  
  
After a full year of studying, I finally had my lightbulb moment.  
  
Everything made sense now, and work started feeling natural.

It had been ten years since I was last home, since I last walked through the large blue door with the welcome mat out front. They tried to resell the house after we left; well, ""forced out"" would be more accurate. They never could sell the house; it was kind of hard to sell a house with the stigma of a suicide attached to it. For ten years, I've been haunted by that day, the day my father took his own life, the day my mother lost her mind, the day my brother came back from the dead. 


My brother, Max, had disappeared during the last few days of his camping trip. He went to a camp called Camp Mannatari, right outside of that freaky town called Sleepy Falls. It was one of those small towns that had existed since colonial times but wasn't on any map, and the only way you could find it is if you'd been there before or someone who'd been there before showed you the way. 


When we got word that Max went missing, we drove the four hours to Camp Mannatari to assist in the search. My dad stayed silent the whole trip, and so did I. The silence in the car was broken by my mother's occasional sobs and repeating to herself, ""My baby boy, we'll find you."" 


When we reached the town of Sleepy Falls, we cut through the market district, since it was the fastest route to the camp. Shopkeepers and shoppers alike stepped out of their stores and just stared at us as we drove by. No smiles, no waves; they just stared. I remember when we visited this place years ago; I was just a kid, but something about this town rubbed me the wrong way. 
When we arrived at the camp, we were greeted by a tall, skinny man with dark hair cut into a bowl cut and dark-rimmed glasses. 


""Hello, my name is Simon. I'm one of the counselors here. You must be the Turners."" The skinny man said, extending his hand out to my father. 

""Grant. This is my wife, Nicole, and my daughter, Ryleigh."" My dad answered as he firmly shook Simon's hand. 

Simon looked at my mother and me and then back to my father. 

""We're doing all we can to look for Max; we have the local sheriff and his two deputies helping in the search."" He said. 

""That's it? Just the sheriff and his two lackeys? Where's the police? The FBI?"" I demanded. ""This is my brother we're talking about!""

""Ryleigh! Be silent!"" My father yelled. 

I shut up quickly. My father wasn't a loud man; he got angry and raised his voice hardly ever, so when he did, it was always a surprise. 

""The town would prefer to keep this a localized event for now. Besides, we also have all of the counselors and volunteer campers assisting in the search."" Simon smiled. 

""We'll help too."" My father said. My mother and I nodded in agreement. 

The search lasted all through the night and into the early morning. We would take shifts during the search; one party would go through the woods to search, while the other stayed at camp and rested until the groups switched. I was a part of the night search along with my dad and Simon. We never found anything during our search, no clothing, no blood, no answers to our calls. 
When we returned to camp to switch parties, the sun was barely peeking through the trees.

""Coffee?"" Simon asked, holding two coffee cups and offering one of them to me. 

""Sure, thanks."" I answered, taking the blue cup from his hand. 

He looked at me for a moment, attempting to read me; maybe he was trying to find words to say to me. 

""Can I help you with something?"" I asked. 

""Oh... sorry, I didn't mean to stare."" He answered. 

""No.... I'm sorry. That was rude of me."" I sighed. 

Simon was maybe a year or two older than me. I'm sure he's worried about Max too, having spent the last couple of months with him. Maybe he had a younger brother also and felt empathetic. 

""Do you travel here to volunteer at the camp every year?"" I asked, trying to make small talk. 

""Oh...uh, actually, I'm a local. I live in town with my uncle."" He answered. 

""Oh, I see... Hey, is the town always this weird when people travel through it?"" I asked. 

""Weird? Oh, ummm, well, we don't get a lot of outsiders here, so whenever someone travels through, people get curious."" He laughed.

Curious? Those looks we got were not the looks of curiosity. They were the look that said, 'You don't belong here.' 

""So, uh, if you're a native to the area, you should know these woods pretty well, huh?"" I suggested.

""Not really, the woods always change after summer."" He said. 

""What do you mean by that?"" I asked.

He looked back at me with panic written all over his face. 

""Oh, ummm, it's just a saying we have around here. Like when the seasons change, so do the trees. And you know every tree looks the same."" He laughed nervously.

Before I could pry further, one of the sheriff's deputies came running back into camp. 

""We found something!"" He said, out of breath. 

My dad immediately jumped out of his chair; he wobbled for a moment from exhaustion but immediately began walking towards the deputy. 

""Show me,"" he demanded.

The deputy nodded in agreement and took my dad into the forest. 

They found my brother; he was dead. Exposure was ruled the cause of death; they found his body naked, lying face down in a creek. They explained this as a phenomenon that happens during events of hypothermia. His back was torn open, exposing his spine, and some of his organs were missing; they explained this with animal predation. 

The drive home was quiet, quieter than the drive there. My mother didn't cry; she was still in shock. I tried to hold everything in. I wanted to cry, I wanted to throw up, and I wanted to die. I didn't want to feel this kind of pain. My father, as per usual, didn't say a word, quiet and stoic, as always. 

The funeral was a few weeks later, open casket. The mortuary did a good job making Max look as close to alive as he could be. I had hoped he would just hop up and tell us it was all an elaborate prank. But he never jumped up, never smiled, and never laughed. I missed his laugh. 

""Hey, Ryleigh. I'm sorry for your loss."" A short, chubby kid with a crew cut said to me. 

""Oh, hey Benny. I didn't recognize you. You got a haircut?"" I asked. 

""Yeah, my mom said my hair wasn't an appropriate length for a funeral."" He said, brushing his hand against his short hair. 

""I fucked up..."" Benny began to cry. 

""If I didn't get summer school, I could've been there with Max. I could've watched his back. Made sure he stayed safe."" He sobbed. 

I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him in close to comfort him. I patted his back to give him a bit of security. As I did, I could feel something poke against my leg. 

""Ewww, Benny, what the fuck?"" I asked as I pushed him away. 

""Sorry! I just... I've never been hugged by a girl before. Not one that wasn't my mom."" He said, wiping away his tears.

""I-it's okay."" I said. 

When we returned home, my dad locked himself in the den, and my mom just began cooking all of Max's favorite dishes and cleaning the kitchen, over and over again. 

A week had passed; my dad never came out of the den, took his meals in there, and only ever came out to go to the bathroom and occasionally shower. My mom slept in Max's room, on his bed, and said it still smelled like him. I could hear her cries at night, muffled in his pillow and by my wall. There were nights when I wanted to sneak out, but I could never bring myself to leave. 
One morning, I was up in my room just listening to music, staring at the posters that littered my ceiling. I heard a loud pop downstairs. I immediately jumped up and ran out the door and down the stairs. 

""What the fuck happened?!"" I screamed as I entered the kitchen. 

What I saw down there, I couldn't explain; it was my brother, or something that looked like my brother, being embraced by my mother. It looked like Max, but not right; his skin hung wrong on his body, like a sheet covering a coatrack. It wasn't Max, not the one we buried, but something trying to imitate him.

""What the fuck?!"" I screamed as I turned around and ran back upstairs and slammed my bedroom door. 

I looked at my bed and saw the cordless phone lying on it. I immediately picked it up and called 911. 

I could hear a small click in between the rings. It was a sound I knew all too well, when Max used to listen in on my conversations with my friends. It was listening. 

""911, what is your emergency?"" The operator asked 

""Hello? Please send help! I'm at 3232 W. Holly Ln."" I said desperately.

""What is happening there?"" The operator asked.
""It's my brother. He's downstairs with my mother. I think my father shot himself."" I cried.

""Your father shot himself, ok, we'll send a cruiser and an ambulance your way."" The operator said.

""No, that's not it; my brother disappeared a month ago at summer camp. They found his body in the woods; we buried him last week. That THING downstairs is not my brother!"" I screamed; I couldn't help but break down and cry.

""Ma'am, can you repeat that? Is this a prank call?"" The operator asked on the line.

""Help, there's an intruder in my house! I'm in danger, and my mom is in danger!"" He shot my father! Help!"" I screamed as I hung up the phone, hoping they'd take me seriously. 

I had to escape somehow to save Mom, I thought to myself. That's when I heard a knock at my door. 

""R-r-ryleigh...let me in...let's watch c-cartoons together..."" the voice said on the other side of my door. 

I quickly, but quietly, began to open my window leading outside. 

""R-ryleigh... Mom m-made pancakes... c-come on down."" The voice continued. 

It sounded like Max, but not like Max; it sounded like someone trying to imitate Max's voice, his cadence, but not quite getting it. 

I began the climb down. I'd made this climb dozens of times before, but I was always able to take my time. I was about halfway down when I began to hear something slamming into my door upstairs. I heard my door cracking and splintering with each slam against it. 

I didn't have time to finish the climb; I had to jump the rest of the way. It was about another 10 feet down, but I didn't want to accidentally twist my ankle or something; I aimed for the bushes below. Landing was a bit rough, but the worst I got was some scratches from thorns and branches in the bushes. I couldn't go back through the front door to get Mom; I needed to arm myself. I had to go through the window in the study. 

It was a tight fit, but I pushed my way through. My dad sat in the chair, his mouth agape; a crown of bone and brains adorned the back of his head. His cherished 1911 was on the floor next to him. Scattered through the den were various plates of half-eaten food and a lot of crumpled-up paper. Upon further inspection of the notes, I realized they were suicide notes. My dad had been planning on ending his own life for days, and finally seeing that thing wearing my brother's face must have finally pushed him over the edge. 

I thought about grabbing the 1911, but I didn't fully know how to use it. The shotgun, on the other hand, that was in the now open gun cabinet, I was more intimate with. Dad taught me how to shoot it, always bruised my shoulder, but he said it was one of the best options for home defense. I loaded in three shells of buckshot into the tube, followed by two slugs and one in the chamber. I grabbed a handful of shells and put them in the front pocket of my flannel shirt I was wearing. 
I slowly opened the door that led out into the hallway, past my parents' room, past the kitchen. I saw my mom still on the ground, crying into the tile still. 

""Mom,"" I whispered. ""You need to run."" 

She didn't respond; she just stood up and brushed herself off. 

""Oh, hi, Ryleigh, I was about to make pancakes for your brother. Can you tell him to wash up? She smiled, her eyes blank with emotion. 

""Fuck..."" I said to myself. 

I heard up the stairs, pushed the butt of the shotgun against my shoulder, ready for the thing to pounce at the top of the stairs. It never came. I checked my room; the door had been broken down, but there was no sign of the thing. I checked my brother's room as well, just in case this thing had the courtesy of closing the door behind it. Nothing there either, just my brother's unmade bed, the way my mother had last left it. 

It was then I heard the TV downstairs turn on at an exceedingly high volume. I quickly turned around and headed back downstairs, past the kitchen, where I saw my mom still standing in the exact same spot, exactly with a whisk in her hand, stirring at air. I walked into the living room and saw the thing sitting on the couch watching cartoons. 

I raised the shotgun towards the back of what you'd call it's head, readied my finger on the trigger. 

""Is it time for cartoons?"" It said, almost perfectly imitating Max's voice. 

I hesitated for a moment. Its head spun around like an owl's, and it looked at me with its blackened eyes. It reminded me of a deer's eyes after you've killed it. It startled me and made my blood run cold; it was the first time seeing it up close. I was startled by its expression and fired the shotgun, clipping the top of its head with the slug. It shrieked at me as it jumped from the couch onto the ceiling and began crawling around like a spider, its limbs gnarled like the branches of a tree and its body twisted like a rag being wrung out. I aimed up at it as it began crawling over my head; this time I hit it center mass. 

Its body fell on top of me, pinning me to the ground. The shotgun was knocked out of my hands, out of reach. A black, sap-like fluid oozed out of its mouth and chest wound; it stank like that of rotting food and putrid water. The thing was heavy, like a tree had fallen on me. I pushed and crawled my way out from under it. I was almost out before it grabbed my ankle. Large, brambled fingers began splitting out from its hands, wrapping around my leg. 

I could see the top of its head where I had shot it earlier; it pulsated like an organ that had grain running through it similar to wood. It looked up at me as its face began to split open, revealing rows of bony teeth running down its vertical maw. I turned to see the shotgun behind me. I lay back to try and reach it but could barely touch it. The creature's maw began to get wider as the tendrils wrapped up to my thigh just below my shorts. 

I took a deep breath and pulled back further, throwing myself further back. My skin was ripping and peeling at my thigh where the creature grasped me. I grabbed the shotgun and pulled it towards me. I pumped the next shell into the chamber, spitting the empty one across the carpet. I raised it towards the ""face"" of this creature, and as I did, a flash of memories of Max hit me. I couldn't tell if these were my memories or the creature's doing in an attempt to catch me off guard. I didn't stop, I didn't blink, I pulled the trigger. 

The buckshot hit its exposed face point-blank as it recoiled in pain, howling with a deafening scream. I pumped the next shell, ready to finish it off. It uncoiled its tendrils from my leg and crashed through the large living room window, escaping. A few moments later I could hear sirens coming up our street. 

There was no explanation for the events that happened that day. The cops wouldn't have believed my story anyway. They chalked it up to being teenage hysteria due to a combination of my brother's death and my father's suicide. My mom never recovered and ended up in a home. I was supposed to graduate that year and start college the next. Instead, I got evaluated. 

They said I had PTSD and depression and that I was probably bipolar too. Said I was a potential danger to myself. Even so, I never told anyone what really happened; I didn't want to end up like where my mom was. I still visit her from time to time. She recognizes me but always says the same thing:
""Tell your brother to go wash up for breakfast."" 

So why am I here? Back at this house? This decrepit memory? A part of me hopes that ""it"" is here. But the other reason is because when the cops were coming back then, I hid the shotgun in a loose floorboard I had known about. I could get any firearm I needed for what I was about to do, but this one I have a personal history with. 
I don't know what that thing was that killed my brother and took his form. Years of research led me to various shapeshifters, skinwalkers, and legends like that. 

I do know that it came from the forest near Sleepy Falls, and that town always bothered me. I knew it was time to go back.

1ldt4x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawCanada/comments/1ldt4x2/lpp_vs_delayed_articlescontinued_searching/,LPP vs. Delayed Articles/Continued searching?,"Hello! I have read through all other posts on this topic and discussed with a several people (ranging from other students to senior partners) but I cannot seem to make up my mind. I am a recent graduate of a Toronto law school with good grades and solid extracurriculars, but no articling position. I do believe (and have been told) that I am a competitive applicant, but I did not apply broadly enough during the articling recruit (long story, but last summer I spent a lot of time in hospital due to a recently discovered rare genetic condition– it is easily managed with medication and not dangerous, but it was definitely a scary time and ViLaw Portal was not a priority!). I have been going out for coffee chats/interest interviews regularly, and have made some really good connections! That being said, I am wondering about the LPP. I would prefer doing a traditional articling position, but I also do not want to delay my call - I do realize that if I want articles at this point I may be looking at a 2026 start date. I suppose my question is this: if my option is a year break between 3L and articling (with the assumption that I will be able to land a position in the next year) or the LPP, which would you choose?  The things I am struggling with are:

1. I have spoken to six people who did the LPP. Two of them recommend it, but are not practicing law - while their experience in the program was valuable to hear about, I am looking to practice in the future and ultimately want to know if the LPP will impact that. Of the remaining four, two were foreign-trained candidates who felt the program gave them opportunities they would not have had access to otherwise, and two were Ontario grads who felt the program was useless and detrimental to their careers. This is obviously a mixed bag, and I know 6 people is not a representative sample. 

2. Of the lawyers I have spoken to, it has been equally mixed. I understand that hiring an LPP graduate is going to be on a firm-by-firm basis and there is no one unilateral consensus, but I want to make sure I am going into this with my eyes wide open. 

3. I am considering registering for the LPP and cutting my losses if I am able to secure an articling position while enrolled in it. I would love to hear people's thoughts, especially those in the GTA, about articling hiring trends: I know that the 2026 recruit is currently ongoing, but is it likely that articling positions for this year continue to pop up? I am also cold-emailing and reaching out to my network. I do have to stay in the GTA, but have a car and am happy to commute if necessary. 

My final question is this: I understand that there is no entitlement to a position, and I am fully accepting of the fact that the LPP may be my best option. That being said, is there anything that I am not currently doing that you would recommend I do to stand out or seek a position? My CDO reviews all my materials before I apply, so I am fairly confident about those. I have heard mixed advice about cold calling -- my understanding is that some places will appreciate a phone call, while others find it quite obtrusive (again, firm-by-firm and no prescriptive rule here). I am a hard worker and I am committed to doing what it takes to find a position, and I just want to know if there is anything you would recommend or if I should just keep on trucking!

1ldt0e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ldt0e6/factor_food_and_keto/,Factor Food and Keto,"I (58F) decided to try Factor for 3 months mainly because it would provide portion control. I ate 2 Factor meals per day, plus coffee with cream and one package of ChocZero Speculos cookies. Here are my results:

The Good: I lost 18 lbs in the 3 months (206 to 188 lbs)The food is very tasty and filling. I was concerned about the relatively high carb counts (15-18 carbs per meal) and calories (650-750 per meal) which was higher than I had done when on keto in the past, but my weightloss has been pretty steady. A big whoosh and then one lb. per week. It was easy to stick to because the food was good and I had a variety of meals to choose from. It was really convenient. Microwave for 3 minutes. Very few dishes to wash (mainly silverware) as I eat out of the plastic tray. Deliveries arrive on Monday. 

The Bad: It's a bit more expensive, but not as much as I thought it would be. My grocery shopping involves picking up creamer and coffee so a lot of money saved there.

The Ugly: There is so much waste. Plastic containers, which I recycle, weren't bad, but the insulation and ice packs have to be thrown away. The stuff in the ice packs can't be put down the drain. I checked with local food pantries and other places to see if I could donate them, but no luck on that front.

I am going to stick with it for another 3 months and see if the relatively high carb counts and calories slow my weight loss over time.",2,1750180681.0,keto,1,0.6,False

They wake up on time, get to work early, and spend every hour doing exactly what they planned with a mix of meetings and work time, then clock out as planned at 4:30. Things ive failed to do over and over (only recently diagnosed with ADHD, still figuring out solutions).

But I know it’s just a highlight reel made for social media, and specifically one for neurotypical people. So I would love to solicit examples from this crowd about what your 9-5 looks like!

Here’s mine, as someone recently diagnosed and medicated:
- Wake up 1 hour before my first Thing To Do (either  a deadline or meeting). Could be 7a, 8a, or 9a.
- Use that hour for my highly motivating tasks: making coffee and breakfast (I love both), washing up
- Take my medication because it’s on top of my coffee maker 
- Do the Thing To Do. 
- *Depending on if I have another high pressure Thing To Do (again, a deadline or meeting to prepare for), take 20-30 minutes to get into the zone of doing it. Sometimes it takes doing mundane tasks, getting a snack, playing the right song before I can start.
- Enter fixation mode until I meet the deadline.

* if there is no pertinent Thing To Do, I spend a long time struggling to focus for a more distant task because I cannot get into the mindset. Yesterday that meant that after my morning meetings, I took a nap and read manga all afternoon, then out of urgency/guilt I hyperfixated and worked from 7pm-1am … lol.

1ldsudr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ldsudr/my_brother_is_downstairs_watching_tv_but_we/,"My Brother is Downstairs Watching TV, but We Buried Him A Week Ago.","
It had been ten years since I was last home, since I last walked through the large blue door with the welcome mat out front. They tried to resell the house after we left; well, ""forced out"" would be more accurate. They never could sell the house; it was kind of hard to sell a house with the stigma of a suicide attached to it. For ten years, I've been haunted by that day, the day my father took his own life, the day my mother lost her mind, the day my brother came back from the dead. 


My brother, Max, had disappeared during the last few days of his camping trip. He went to a camp called Camp Mannatari, right outside of that freaky town called Sleepy Falls. It was one of those small towns that had existed since colonial times but wasn't on any map, and the only way you could find it is if you'd been there before or someone who'd been there before showed you the way. 


When we got word that Max went missing, we drove the four hours to Camp Mannatari to assist in the search. My dad stayed silent the whole trip, and so did I. The silence in the car was broken by my mother's occasional sobs and repeating to herself, ""My baby boy, we'll find you."" 


When we reached the town of Sleepy Falls, we cut through the market district, since it was the fastest route to the camp. Shopkeepers and shoppers alike stepped out of their stores and just stared at us as we drove by. No smiles, no waves; they just stared. I remember when we visited this place years ago; I was just a kid, but something about this town rubbed me the wrong way. 
When we arrived at the camp, we were greeted by a tall, skinny man with dark hair cut into a bowl cut and dark-rimmed glasses. 


""Hello, my name is Simon. I'm one of the counselors here. You must be the Turners."" The skinny man said, extending his hand out to my father. 

""Grant. This is my wife, Nicole, and my daughter, Ryleigh."" My dad answered as he firmly shook Simon's hand. 

Simon looked at my mother and me and then back to my father. 

""We're doing all we can to look for Max; we have the local sheriff and his two deputies helping in the search."" He said. 

""That's it? Just the sheriff and his two lackeys? Where's the police? The FBI?"" I demanded. ""This is my brother we're talking about!""

""Ryleigh! Be silent!"" My father yelled. 

I shut up quickly. My father wasn't a loud man; he got angry and raised his voice hardly ever, so when he did, it was always a surprise. 

""The town would prefer to keep this a localized event for now. Besides, we also have all of the counselors and volunteer campers assisting in the search."" Simon smiled. 

""We'll help too."" My father said. My mother and I nodded in agreement. 

The search lasted all through the night and into the early morning. We would take shifts during the search; one party would go through the woods to search, while the other stayed at camp and rested until the groups switched. I was a part of the night search along with my dad and Simon. We never found anything during our search, no clothing, no blood, no answers to our calls. 
When we returned to camp to switch parties, the sun was barely peeking through the trees.

""Coffee?"" Simon asked, holding two coffee cups and offering one of them to me. 

""Sure, thanks."" I answered, taking the blue cup from his hand. 

He looked at me for a moment, attempting to read me; maybe he was trying to find words to say to me. 

""Can I help you with something?"" I asked. 

""Oh... sorry, I didn't mean to stare."" He answered. 

""No.... I'm sorry. That was rude of me."" I sighed. 

Simon was maybe a year or two older than me. I'm sure he's worried about Max too, having spent the last couple of months with him. Maybe he had a younger brother also and felt empathetic. 

""Do you travel here to volunteer at the camp every year?"" I asked, trying to make small talk. 

""Oh...uh, actually, I'm a local. I live in town with my uncle."" He answered. 

""Oh, I see... Hey, is the town always this weird when people travel through it?"" I asked. 

""Weird? Oh, ummm, well, we don't get a lot of outsiders here, so whenever someone travels through, people get curious."" He laughed.

Curious? Those looks we got were not the looks of curiosity. They were the look that said, 'You don't belong here.' 

""So, uh, if you're a native to the area, you should know these woods pretty well, huh?"" I suggested.

""Not really, the woods always change after summer."" He said. 

""What do you mean by that?"" I asked.

He looked back at me with panic written all over his face. 

""Oh, ummm, it's just a saying we have around here. Like when the seasons change, so do the trees. And you know every tree looks the same."" He laughed nervously.

Before I could pry further, one of the sheriff's deputies came running back into camp. 

""We found something!"" He said, out of breath. 

My dad immediately jumped out of his chair; he wobbled for a moment from exhaustion but immediately began walking towards the deputy. 

""Show me,"" he demanded.

The deputy nodded in agreement and took my dad into the forest. 

They found my brother; he was dead. Exposure was ruled the cause of death; they found his body naked, lying face down in a creek. They explained this as a phenomenon that happens during events of hypothermia. His back was torn open, exposing his spine, and some of his organs were missing; they explained this with animal predation. 

The drive home was quiet, quieter than the drive there. My mother didn't cry; she was still in shock. I tried to hold everything in. I wanted to cry, I wanted to throw up, and I wanted to die. I didn't want to feel this kind of pain. My father, as per usual, didn't say a word, quiet and stoic, as always. 

The funeral was a few weeks later, open casket. The mortuary did a good job making Max look as close to alive as he could be. I had hoped he would just hop up and tell us it was all an elaborate prank. But he never jumped up, never smiled, and never laughed. I missed his laugh. 

""Hey, Ryleigh. I'm sorry for your loss."" A short, chubby kid with a crew cut said to me. 

""Oh, hey Benny. I didn't recognize you. You got a haircut?"" I asked. 

""Yeah, my mom said my hair wasn't an appropriate length for a funeral."" He said, brushing his hand against his short hair. 

""I fucked up..."" Benny began to cry. 

""If I didn't get summer school, I could've been there with Max. I could've watched his back. Made sure he stayed safe."" He sobbed. 

I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him in close to comfort him. I patted his back to give him a bit of security. As I did, I could feel something poke against my leg. 

""Ewww, Benny, what the fuck?"" I asked as I pushed him away. 

""Sorry! I just... I've never been hugged by a girl before. Not one that wasn't my mom."" He said, wiping away his tears.

""I-it's okay."" I said. 

When we returned home, my dad locked himself in the den, and my mom just began cooking all of Max's favorite dishes and cleaning the kitchen, over and over again. 

A week had passed; my dad never came out of the den, took his meals in there, and only ever came out to go to the bathroom and occasionally shower. My mom slept in Max's room, on his bed, and said it still smelled like him. I could hear her cries at night, muffled in his pillow and by my wall. There were nights when I wanted to sneak out, but I could never bring myself to leave. 
One morning, I was up in my room just listening to music, staring at the posters that littered my ceiling. I heard a loud pop downstairs. I immediately jumped up and ran out the door and down the stairs. 

""What the fuck happened?!"" I screamed as I entered the kitchen. 

What I saw down there, I couldn't explain; it was my brother, or something that looked like my brother, being embraced by my mother. It looked like Max, but not right; his skin hung wrong on his body, like a sheet covering a coatrack. It wasn't Max, not the one we buried, but something trying to imitate him.

""What the fuck?!"" I screamed as I turned around and ran back upstairs and slammed my bedroom door. 

I looked at my bed and saw the cordless phone lying on it. I immediately picked it up and called 911. 

I could hear a small click in between the rings. It was a sound I knew all too well, when Max used to listen in on my conversations with my friends. It was listening. 

""911, what is your emergency?"" The operator asked 

""Hello? Please send help! I'm at 3232 W. Holly Ln."" I said desperately.

""What is happening there?"" The operator asked.
""It's my brother. He's downstairs with my mother. I think my father shot himself."" I cried.

""Your father shot himself, ok, we'll send a cruiser and an ambulance your way."" The operator said.

""No, that's not it; my brother disappeared a month ago at summer camp. They found his body in the woods; we buried him last week. That THING downstairs is not my brother!"" I screamed; I couldn't help but break down and cry.

""Ma'am, can you repeat that? Is this a prank call?"" The operator asked on the line.

""Help, there's an intruder in my house! I'm in danger, and my mom is in danger!"" He shot my father! Help!"" I screamed as I hung up the phone, hoping they'd take me seriously. 

I had to escape somehow to save Mom, I thought to myself. That's when I heard a knock at my door. 

""R-r-ryleigh...let me in...let's watch c-cartoons together..."" the voice said on the other side of my door. 

I quickly, but quietly, began to open my window leading outside. 

""R-ryleigh... Mom m-made pancakes... c-come on down."" The voice continued. 

It sounded like Max, but not like Max; it sounded like someone trying to imitate Max's voice, his cadence, but not quite getting it. 

I began the climb down. I'd made this climb dozens of times before, but I was always able to take my time. I was about halfway down when I began to hear something slamming into my door upstairs. I heard my door cracking and splintering with each slam against it. 

I didn't have time to finish the climb; I had to jump the rest of the way. It was about another 10 feet down, but I didn't want to accidentally twist my ankle or something; I aimed for the bushes below. Landing was a bit rough, but the worst I got was some scratches from thorns and branches in the bushes. I couldn't go back through the front door to get Mom; I needed to arm myself. I had to go through the window in the study. 

It was a tight fit, but I pushed my way through. My dad sat in the chair, his mouth agape; a crown of bone and brains adorned the back of his head. His cherished 1911 was on the floor next to him. Scattered through the den were various plates of half-eaten food and a lot of crumpled-up paper. Upon further inspection of the notes, I realized they were suicide notes. My dad had been planning on ending his own life for days, and finally seeing that thing wearing my brother's face must have finally pushed him over the edge. 

I thought about grabbing the 1911, but I didn't fully know how to use it. The shotgun, on the other hand, that was in the now open gun cabinet, I was more intimate with. Dad taught me how to shoot it, always bruised my shoulder, but he said it was one of the best options for home defense. I loaded in three shells of buckshot into the tube, followed by two slugs and one in the chamber. I grabbed a handful of shells and put them in the front pocket of my flannel shirt I was wearing. 
I slowly opened the door that led out into the hallway, past my parents' room, past the kitchen. I saw my mom still on the ground, crying into the tile still. 

""Mom,"" I whispered. ""You need to run."" 

She didn't respond; she just stood up and brushed herself off. 

""Oh, hi, Ryleigh, I was about to make pancakes for your brother. Can you tell him to wash up? She smiled, her eyes blank with emotion. 

""Fuck..."" I said to myself. 

I heard up the stairs, pushed the butt of the shotgun against my shoulder, ready for the thing to pounce at the top of the stairs. It never came. I checked my room; the door had been broken down, but there was no sign of the thing. I checked my brother's room as well, just in case this thing had the courtesy of closing the door behind it. Nothing there either, just my brother's unmade bed, the way my mother had last left it. 

It was then I heard the TV downstairs turn on at an exceedingly high volume. I quickly turned around and headed back downstairs, past the kitchen, where I saw my mom still standing in the exact same spot, exactly with a whisk in her hand, stirring at air. I walked into the living room and saw the thing sitting on the couch watching cartoons. 

I raised the shotgun towards the back of what you'd call it's head, readied my finger on the trigger. 

""Is it time for cartoons?"" It said, almost perfectly imitating Max's voice. 

I hesitated for a moment. Its head spun around like an owl's, and it looked at me with its blackened eyes. It reminded me of a deer's eyes after you've killed it. It startled me and made my blood run cold; it was the first time seeing it up close. I was startled by its expression and fired the shotgun, clipping the top of its head with the slug. It shrieked at me as it jumped from the couch onto the ceiling and began crawling around like a spider, its limbs gnarled like the branches of a tree and its body twisted like a rag being wrung out. I aimed up at it as it began crawling over my head; this time I hit it center mass. 

Its body fell on top of me, pinning me to the ground. The shotgun was knocked out of my hands, out of reach. A black, sap-like fluid oozed out of its mouth and chest wound; it stank like that of rotting food and putrid water. The thing was heavy, like a tree had fallen on me. I pushed and crawled my way out from under it. I was almost out before it grabbed my ankle. Large, brambled fingers began splitting out from its hands, wrapping around my leg. 

I could see the top of its head where I had shot it earlier; it pulsated like an organ that had grain running through it similar to wood. It looked up at me as its face began to split open, revealing rows of bony teeth running down its vertical maw. I turned to see the shotgun behind me. I lay back to try and reach it but could barely touch it. The creature's maw began to get wider as the tendrils wrapped up to my thigh just below my shorts. 

I took a deep breath and pulled back further, throwing myself further back. My skin was ripping and peeling at my thigh where the creature grasped me. I grabbed the shotgun and pulled it towards me. I pumped the next shell into the chamber, spitting the empty one across the carpet. I raised it towards the ""face"" of this creature, and as I did, a flash of memories of Max hit me. I couldn't tell if these were my memories or the creature's doing in an attempt to catch me off guard. I didn't stop, I didn't blink, I pulled the trigger. 

The buckshot hit its exposed face point-blank as it recoiled in pain, howling with a deafening scream. I pumped the next shell, ready to finish it off. It uncoiled its tendrils from my leg and crashed through the large living room window, escaping. A few moments later I could hear sirens coming up our street. 

There was no explanation for the events that happened that day. The cops wouldn't have believed my story anyway. They chalked it up to being teenage hysteria due to a combination of my brother's death and my father's suicide. My mom never recovered and ended up in a home. I was supposed to graduate that year and start college the next. Instead, I got evaluated. 

They said I had PTSD and depression and that I was probably bipolar too. Said I was a potential danger to myself. Even so, I never told anyone what really happened; I didn't want to end up like where my mom was. I still visit her from time to time. She recognizes me but always says the same thing:
""Tell your brother to go wash up for breakfast."" 

So why am I here? Back at this house? This decrepit memory? A part of me hopes that ""it"" is here. But the other reason is because when the cops were coming back then, I hid the shotgun in a loose floorboard I had known about. I could get any firearm I needed for what I was about to do, but this one I have a personal history with. 
I don't know what that thing was that killed my brother and took his form. Years of research led me to various shapeshifters, skinwalkers, and legends like that. 

I do know that it came from the forest near Sleepy Falls, and that town always bothered me. I knew it was time to go back.

1ldstw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1ldstw5/losing_faith_in_getting_the_right_meds/,Losing faith in getting the right meds,"Hi all. I'm a couple of months into my journey post diagnosis. I'm a 48 year old man. Hardly any motivation to get things done. Typical zero attention span. The only thing I can get right is work. I work 4 on 4 off night shift as a truck driver and the regiment of that routine has had me diving head first into overtime. I do an extra shift most weeks. When I work my day is set, wake up. Pick up daughter. Take meds (72mg concerta xl does absolutely zero for me at all). Day food till 1730. Then work for 7pm. I eat a good healthy balanced diet on work days. Plenty of protein, fibre and fats with a small amount of carbs. I've cut my caffeine levels from 6 cups of full caffeine coffee a day to 1.  I drink lots of water and decaf coffee.  My routine is on point on work days. When im off I relax my routine quite a bit unless I'm really mindful. I'm that tired from work I really struggle to get things done I should, house work for a like nahhhh, I just sit doom scrolling or watching YouTube. I have no hobbies and I have no fun. My daughter takes up a lot of my time and I've always said I'll be here for her until she doesn't need me and I'm pleased I stick to that it's none negotiable she's the number 1thing in my life. She 13 now and my time will come in a few years. I'm fine with that. I've been on elvanse up to 50mg but it left me a lot of times ""stoned"" and after one wobble in a shop where everything started spinning and I couldn't think straight I said enough was enough (caviate I'd had 3 large beers the night before and now I'm worried was that the cause and did I jump ship too soon). I'm now on concerta xl I'm up to 72mg a day and I can honestly say I'm not even noticing any effect whatsoever!!! I've been on it a month gradually increasing. I'm waiting another few weeks for a miraculous change that I know isn't coming. The one thing that has changed in all my time under meds is my temper has calmed and I'm not as quick to fly off the handle but it still happens. I'm in a relationship where my wife just thinks I should calm down and I should control myself ""because you're not a kid""  she refuses to acknowledge adhd as being something real in adults and something we can just control. I'm at my whits end. I'm begining to think I may as well not even take anything because nothing has worked. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Im worried that I jumped from elvanse too soon as I was a lot of the time feeling great. But I didn't want an antidepressant effect I want my organisational and time management functions improved. Not just sit like a teenager who'd smoked a joint.

Sorry for the long rambling post but I need help and advise. My specialist just seems to pump up the dose and little else. ",2,1750180281.0,ADHDUK,4,1.0,False

1ldss9u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ldss9u,Little Women- my review/commentary.,"Little Women is one of those books that makes my heart burst with warmth. This story of four sisters maneuvering their way through girlhood in a cozy little American town in the 1800s makes you want to grab a cup of coffee and swaddle in your favorite blanket as you read it. It’s an easy one night read. Beautiful Meg, daring Jo, quiet and gentle Beth and angry little Amy become our friends along the way, as they let you into their tiny wooden house, kept neat, clean and full of life by their affectionate mother, Marmee.

Louisa M. Alcott’s writing style has the ability to pull you into the story, she writes in third person, which makes you silent spectator to the four girls’ heartwarming little troubles and wins. You get a peek into their minds, and you see how starkly different all the four March sisters are. This story is about how each of their lives change when a rich and old Mr. Lawrence moves in with his young grandson- Laurie- into the elegant and massive house next door.

Something I noticed about this book is that Alcott has built all the characters in such a way that once you’ve read the story, you will find echoes of them in every person you meet. You’ll have a Jo in your office, a Laurie in your friend’s circle, a Meg in your Library and an Amy in your art class. Parts of you will relate to the warm relationship between Beth and the old Mr. Lawrence who craves a granddaughter, Jo’s many rebellions, Amy’s vanity and pull towards a finer lifestyle and Meg’s contentment in finding the man of her dreams.

You’ll find yourself internally celebrating with the girls when they are happy, and silently weeping into your blanket, sharing their sorrow, when tragedy strikes their household. You’ll find yourself sighing patiently and smiling to yourself with Marmee as she quietly admires how beautiful her daughters have turned out to be. 

This book makes you rejoice, cry, grin from ear to ear, and root for every single one of them. But most of all, it leaves you with a long, warm hug that keeps you coming back for more.

1ldsr5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_code_exile1911/comments/1ldsr5s/my_brother_is_downstairs_watching_tv_but_we/,"My Brother is Downstairs Watching TV, but We Buried Him A Week Ago.","It had been ten years since I was last home, since I last walked through the large blue door with the welcome mat out front. They tried to resell the house after we left; well, ""forced out"" would be more accurate. They never could sell the house; it was kind of hard to sell a house with the stigma of a suicide attached to it. For ten years, I've been haunted by that day, the day my father took his own life, the day my mother lost her mind, the day my brother came back from the dead. 


My brother, Max, had disappeared during the last few days of his camping trip. He went to a camp called Camp Mannatari, right outside of that freaky town called Sleepy Falls. It was one of those small towns that had existed since colonial times but wasn't on any map, and the only way you could find it is if you'd been there before or someone who'd been there before showed you the way. 


When we got word that Max went missing, we drove the four hours to Camp Mannatari to assist in the search. My dad stayed silent the whole trip, and so did I. The silence in the car was broken by my mother's occasional sobs and repeating to herself, ""My baby boy, we'll find you."" 


When we reached the town of Sleepy Falls, we cut through the market district, since it was the fastest route to the camp. Shopkeepers and shoppers alike stepped out of their stores and just stared at us as we drove by. No smiles, no waves; they just stared. I remember when we visited this place years ago; I was just a kid, but something about this town rubbed me the wrong way. 
When we arrived at the camp, we were greeted by a tall, skinny man with dark hair cut into a bowl cut and dark-rimmed glasses. 


""Hello, my name is Simon. I'm one of the counselors here. You must be the Turners."" The skinny man said, extending his hand out to my father. 

""Grant. This is my wife, Nicole, and my daughter, Ryleigh."" My dad answered as he firmly shook Simon's hand. 

Simon looked at my mother and me and then back to my father. 

""We're doing all we can to look for Max; we have the local sheriff and his two deputies helping in the search."" He said. 

""That's it? Just the sheriff and his two lackeys? Where's the police? The FBI?"" I demanded. ""This is my brother we're talking about!""

""Ryleigh! Be silent!"" My father yelled. 

I shut up quickly. My father wasn't a loud man; he got angry and raised his voice hardly ever, so when he did, it was always a surprise. 

""The town would prefer to keep this a localized event for now. Besides, we also have all of the counselors and volunteer campers assisting in the search."" Simon smiled. 

""We'll help too."" My father said. My mother and I nodded in agreement. 

The search lasted all through the night and into the early morning. We would take shifts during the search; one party would go through the woods to search, while the other stayed at camp and rested until the groups switched. I was a part of the night search along with my dad and Simon. We never found anything during our search, no clothing, no blood, no answers to our calls. 
When we returned to camp to switch parties, the sun was barely peeking through the trees.

""Coffee?"" Simon asked, holding two coffee cups and offering one of them to me. 

""Sure, thanks."" I answered, taking the blue cup from his hand. 

He looked at me for a moment, attempting to read me; maybe he was trying to find words to say to me. 

""Can I help you with something?"" I asked. 

""Oh... sorry, I didn't mean to stare."" He answered. 

""No.... I'm sorry. That was rude of me."" I sighed. 

Simon was maybe a year or two older than me. I'm sure he's worried about Max too, having spent the last couple of months with him. Maybe he had a younger brother also and felt empathetic. 

""Do you travel here to volunteer at the camp every year?"" I asked, trying to make small talk. 

""Oh...uh, actually, I'm a local. I live in town with my uncle."" He answered. 

""Oh, I see... Hey, is the town always this weird when people travel through it?"" I asked. 

""Weird? Oh, ummm, well, we don't get a lot of outsiders here, so whenever someone travels through, people get curious."" He laughed.

Curious? Those looks we got were not the looks of curiosity. They were the look that said, 'You don't belong here.' 

""So, uh, if you're a native to the area, you should know these woods pretty well, huh?"" I suggested.

""Not really, the woods always change after summer."" He said. 

""What do you mean by that?"" I asked.

He looked back at me with panic written all over his face. 

""Oh, ummm, it's just a saying we have around here. Like when the seasons change, so do the trees. And you know every tree looks the same."" He laughed nervously.

Before I could pry further, one of the sheriff's deputies came running back into camp. 

""We found something!"" He said, out of breath. 

My dad immediately jumped out of his chair; he wobbled for a moment from exhaustion but immediately began walking towards the deputy. 

""Show me,"" he demanded.

The deputy nodded in agreement and took my dad into the forest. 

They found my brother; he was dead. Exposure was ruled the cause of death; they found his body naked, lying face down in a creek. They explained this as a phenomenon that happens during events of hypothermia. His back was torn open, exposing his spine, and some of his organs were missing; they explained this with animal predation. 

The drive home was quiet, quieter than the drive there. My mother didn't cry; she was still in shock. I tried to hold everything in. I wanted to cry, I wanted to throw up, and I wanted to die. I didn't want to feel this kind of pain. My father, as per usual, didn't say a word, quiet and stoic, as always. 

The funeral was a few weeks later, open casket. The mortuary did a good job making Max look as close to alive as he could be. I had hoped he would just hop up and tell us it was all an elaborate prank. But he never jumped up, never smiled, and never laughed. I missed his laugh. 

""Hey, Ryleigh. I'm sorry for your loss."" A short, chubby kid with a crew cut said to me. 

""Oh, hey Benny. I didn't recognize you. You got a haircut?"" I asked. 

""Yeah, my mom said my hair wasn't an appropriate length for a funeral."" He said, brushing his hand against his short hair. 

""I fucked up..."" Benny began to cry. 

""If I didn't get summer school, I could've been there with Max. I could've watched his back. Made sure he stayed safe."" He sobbed. 

I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him in close to comfort him. I patted his back to give him a bit of security. As I did, I could feel something poke against my leg. 

""Ewww, Benny, what the fuck?"" I asked as I pushed him away. 

""Sorry! I just... I've never been hugged by a girl before. Not one that wasn't my mom."" He said, wiping away his tears.

""I-it's okay."" I said. 

When we returned home, my dad locked himself in the den, and my mom just began cooking all of Max's favorite dishes and cleaning the kitchen, over and over again. 

A week had passed; my dad never came out of the den, took his meals in there, and only ever came out to go to the bathroom and occasionally shower. My mom slept in Max's room, on his bed, and said it still smelled like him. I could hear her cries at night, muffled in his pillow and by my wall. There were nights when I wanted to sneak out, but I could never bring myself to leave. 
One morning, I was up in my room just listening to music, staring at the posters that littered my ceiling. I heard a loud pop downstairs. I immediately jumped up and ran out the door and down the stairs. 

""What the fuck happened?!"" I screamed as I entered the kitchen. 

What I saw down there, I couldn't explain; it was my brother, or something that looked like my brother, being embraced by my mother. It looked like Max, but not right; his skin hung wrong on his body, like a sheet covering a coatrack. It wasn't Max, not the one we buried, but something trying to imitate him.

""What the fuck?!"" I screamed as I turned around and ran back upstairs and slammed my bedroom door. 

I looked at my bed and saw the cordless phone lying on it. I immediately picked it up and called 911. 

I could hear a small click in between the rings. It was a sound I knew all too well, when Max used to listen in on my conversations with my friends. It was listening. 

""911, what is your emergency?"" The operator asked 

""Hello? Please send help! I'm at 3232 W. Holly Ln."" I said desperately.

""What is happening there?"" The operator asked.
""It's my brother. He's downstairs with my mother. I think my father shot himself."" I cried.

""Your father shot himself, ok, we'll send a cruiser and an ambulance your way."" The operator said.

""No, that's not it; my brother disappeared a month ago at summer camp. They found his body in the woods; we buried him last week. That THING downstairs is not my brother!"" I screamed; I couldn't help but break down and cry.

""Ma'am, can you repeat that? Is this a prank call?"" The operator asked on the line.

""Help, there's an intruder in my house! I'm in danger, and my mom is in danger!"" He shot my father! Help!"" I screamed as I hung up the phone, hoping they'd take me seriously. 

I had to escape somehow to save Mom, I thought to myself. That's when I heard a knock at my door. 

""R-r-ryleigh...let me in...let's watch c-cartoons together..."" the voice said on the other side of my door. 

I quickly, but quietly, began to open my window leading outside. 

""R-ryleigh... Mom m-made pancakes... c-come on down."" The voice continued. 

It sounded like Max, but not like Max; it sounded like someone trying to imitate Max's voice, his cadence, but not quite getting it. 

I began the climb down. I'd made this climb dozens of times before, but I was always able to take my time. I was about halfway down when I began to hear something slamming into my door upstairs. I heard my door cracking and splintering with each slam against it. 

I didn't have time to finish the climb; I had to jump the rest of the way. It was about another 10 feet down, but I didn't want to accidentally twist my ankle or something; I aimed for the bushes below. Landing was a bit rough, but the worst I got was some scratches from thorns and branches in the bushes. I couldn't go back through the front door to get Mom; I needed to arm myself. I had to go through the window in the study. 

It was a tight fit, but I pushed my way through. My dad sat in the chair, his mouth agape; a crown of bone and brains adorned the back of his head. His cherished 1911 was on the floor next to him. Scattered through the den were various plates of half-eaten food and a lot of crumpled-up paper. Upon further inspection of the notes, I realized they were suicide notes. My dad had been planning on ending his own life for days, and finally seeing that thing wearing my brother's face must have finally pushed him over the edge. 

I thought about grabbing the 1911, but I didn't fully know how to use it. The shotgun, on the other hand, that was in the now open gun cabinet, I was more intimate with. Dad taught me how to shoot it, always bruised my shoulder, but he said it was one of the best options for home defense. I loaded in three shells of buckshot into the tube, followed by two slugs and one in the chamber. I grabbed a handful of shells and put them in the front pocket of my flannel shirt I was wearing. 
I slowly opened the door that led out into the hallway, past my parents' room, past the kitchen. I saw my mom still on the ground, crying into the tile still. 

""Mom,"" I whispered. ""You need to run."" 

She didn't respond; she just stood up and brushed herself off. 

""Oh, hi, Ryleigh, I was about to make pancakes for your brother. Can you tell him to wash up? She smiled, her eyes blank with emotion. 

""Fuck..."" I said to myself. 

I heard up the stairs, pushed the butt of the shotgun against my shoulder, ready for the thing to pounce at the top of the stairs. It never came. I checked my room; the door had been broken down, but there was no sign of the thing. I checked my brother's room as well, just in case this thing had the courtesy of closing the door behind it. Nothing there either, just my brother's unmade bed, the way my mother had last left it. 

It was then I heard the TV downstairs turn on at an exceedingly high volume. I quickly turned around and headed back downstairs, past the kitchen, where I saw my mom still standing in the exact same spot, exactly with a whisk in her hand, stirring at air. I walked into the living room and saw the thing sitting on the couch watching cartoons. 

I raised the shotgun towards the back of what you'd call it's head, readied my finger on the trigger. 

""Is it time for cartoons?"" It said, almost perfectly imitating Max's voice. 

I hesitated for a moment. Its head spun around like an owl's, and it looked at me with its blackened eyes. It reminded me of a deer's eyes after you've killed it. It startled me and made my blood run cold; it was the first time seeing it up close. I was startled by its expression and fired the shotgun, clipping the top of its head with the slug. It shrieked at me as it jumped from the couch onto the ceiling and began crawling around like a spider, its limbs gnarled like the branches of a tree and its body twisted like a rag being wrung out. I aimed up at it as it began crawling over my head; this time I hit it center mass. 

Its body fell on top of me, pinning me to the ground. The shotgun was knocked out of my hands, out of reach. A black, sap-like fluid oozed out of its mouth and chest wound; it stank like that of rotting food and putrid water. The thing was heavy, like a tree had fallen on me. I pushed and crawled my way out from under it. I was almost out before it grabbed my ankle. Large, brambled fingers began splitting out from its hands, wrapping around my leg. 

I could see the top of its head where I had shot it earlier; it pulsated like an organ that had grain running through it similar to wood. It looked up at me as its face began to split open, revealing rows of bony teeth running down its vertical maw. I turned to see the shotgun behind me. I lay back to try and reach it but could barely touch it. The creature's maw began to get wider as the tendrils wrapped up to my thigh just below my shorts. 

I took a deep breath and pulled back further, throwing myself further back. My skin was ripping and peeling at my thigh where the creature grasped me. I grabbed the shotgun and pulled it towards me. I pumped the next shell into the chamber, spitting the empty one across the carpet. I raised it towards the ""face"" of this creature, and as I did, a flash of memories of Max hit me. I couldn't tell if these were my memories or the creature's doing in an attempt to catch me off guard. I didn't stop, I didn't blink, I pulled the trigger. 

The buckshot hit its exposed face point-blank as it recoiled in pain, howling with a deafening scream. I pumped the next shell, ready to finish it off. It uncoiled its tendrils from my leg and crashed through the large living room window, escaping. A few moments later I could hear sirens coming up our street. 

There was no explanation for the events that happened that day. The cops wouldn't have believed my story anyway. They chalked it up to being teenage hysteria due to a combination of my brother's death and my father's suicide. My mom never recovered and ended up in a home. I was supposed to graduate that year and start college the next. Instead, I got evaluated. 

They said I had PTSD and depression and that I was probably bipolar too. Said I was a potential danger to myself. Even so, I never told anyone what really happened; I didn't want to end up like where my mom was. I still visit her from time to time. She recognizes me but always says the same thing:
""Tell your brother to go wash up for breakfast."" 

So why am I here? Back at this house? This decrepit memory? A part of me hopes that ""it"" is here. But the other reason is because when the cops were coming back then, I hid the shotgun in a loose floorboard I had known about. I could get any firearm I needed for what I was about to do, but this one I have a personal history with. 
I don't know what that thing was that killed my brother and took his form. Years of research led me to various shapeshifters, skinwalkers, and legends like that. 

I do know that it came from the forest near Sleepy Falls, and that town always bothered me. I knew it was time to go back.

1ldso89,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1ldso89/pvcs_alcohol_and_gi_issues/,"PVC’s, alcohol and GI issues","Hi everyone. M 34 here. I’ve been mostly a lurker on this sub for the past couple years and it’s given me a lot of peace of mind knowing others deal with PVC’s and what their coping and treatment strategies have been. These things have borderline ruined me for the past 2 years when I really started to notice them. Traumatic events and lots and lots of alcohol has been the theme for me the past few years. My PVC’s have been rampant during this time and at their worst crept up into the 10-12% range. Not fun. 

Recently (43 days ago) I finally decided enough was enough with drinking. Often times I would drink at night until my PVC’s would subside which towards the end took at least a bottle of wine plus a couple shots. I would wake up hungover, alcohol still in my system and PVC’s still not bugging me. By mid morning though, they would come on and not leave me alone until I had a few drinks. They would temporarily stop during and right after workouts but would eventually come back and drive me to drinking.

Coupled with alcohol consumption I noticed my PVC’s would flare up really bad if I was constipated or stomach generally not feeling good. Hungover, constipated and eating poorly was the ultimate combo for PVC’s. Drinking would usually help the digestive system get moving though so when I took a couple days off drinking I would ultimately be constipated and deal with the same or worse PVC’s. I felt very very stuck in a damned if I do damned if I don’t situation with drinking. 

On may 4th, I had my last drink. The PVC’s the next few days were borderline unbearable. But like always, I gritted my teeth and just dealt with them. I knew I needed to try and give quitting drinking a full go regardless of how bad my PVC’s were. 

First week PVC’s were terrible. Constipated, anxious, nothing felt right. I would take gentle laxatives to clear things out which definitely helped. Second week PVC’s were noticeably down but still noticed several an hour. Still constipated and would take laxatives as needed to clear things out. That helped. Third week, still noticing PVC’s, starting to have bowel movements on my own (coffee helped) and generally starting to feel not terrible all the time. Fourth week my body started to finally feel like everything was operating how it should. 2-3 bowel movements without laxatives a day and PVC’s down to just a couple noticeable ones a day. Basically nothing especially considering where I’ve been. 

The last 2 weeks, still having healthy bowel movements and have had basically zero PVC’s that I’ve noticed. I feel free for the first time in what feels like a decade. I am sober, I’ve lost weight, I have way more energy and my anxiety has melted away because (knock on wood) I feel like I have figured what causes PVC’s for me. I hope this helps someone. There’s a million reasons to quit drinking and PVC’s is far from the only reason I quit drinking but damn am I happy I did. Maybe this will inspire someone else. 

TLDR; quit drinking, pooping normally again and PVC’s have evaporated.

1ldso6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TicketToEverywhere/comments/1ldso6z/best_business_travel_backpacks/,Best Business Travel Backpacks,"Picture this: You're standing in the TSA line at 6 AM, juggling your coffee while desperately trying to extract your laptop from a tangled mess of cables, documents, and whatever else has vanished into your bag's black hole. The agent waves you forward impatiently, and you've become *that person* – the one holding up the entire security line like a rookie traveler.

Now imagine this instead: One smooth motion, your laptop slides out effortlessly, your passport is exactly where you expect it, and your chargers are organized in their designated pocket. You glide through security and head straight to the lounge for a proper pre-flight espresso – calm, controlled, and completely professional.

**The difference? The right backpack.**

After testing dozens of options and talking to frequent business travelers, I've found that the perfect business travel backpack isn't just about looking professional (though that matters). It's about creating a system that works *with* you, not against you, whether you're rushing between terminals or walking into a boardroom straight off a red-eye flight.

The bags on this list have been chosen based on real-world testing, professional appearance, organizational features, and the kind of durability that justifies their price tags. If you're tired of fighting with your current bag, you're in the right place.

# What Makes a Business Travel Backpack Different?

Not all travel backpacks are created equal, especially when your livelihood depends on looking polished and staying organized. Here's what sets business travel backpacks apart from their casual cousins:

**Professional Appearance**: While hiking backpacks scream ""adventure,"" business backpacks whisper ""competence."" The best ones look equally at home in a boardroom and an airport terminal. Think clean lines, premium materials, and subdued colors that complement business attire rather than clash with it.

**Laptop Protection That Actually Works**: Your $3,000 MacBook deserves better than a thin sleeve in a cavernous main compartment. Quality business backpacks feature dedicated, padded laptop compartments that keep your tech secure and easily accessible for security checks.

**Organization Systems**: Business travelers carry different gear than backpackers. You need dedicated spaces for charging cables, business cards, pens, documents, and all the small essentials that can turn into chaos without proper organization. The best bags include thoughtful pocket arrangements that keep everything in its place.

**TSA-Friendly Design**: Features like lay-flat laptop compartments and easy-access pockets can shave precious minutes off your security experience – minutes that add up when you're traveling weekly.

**Size Optimization**: Business travel backpacks are typically designed to maximize carry-on compliance while minimizing bulk. They're the Goldilocks of travel gear – not too big, not too small, but just right for 3-7 day business trips.

# Key Features to Consider When Choosing

# Laptop Protection and Accessibility

Your laptop is likely your most valuable and essential business travel item. Look for **dedicated, padded compartments** that keep your laptop separate from other items. TSA-friendly designs that allow you to keep your laptop in the bag during security screening can save time, though be aware that TSA agents may still request removal.

# Organization Systems

Consider your typical business travel gear: laptop, chargers, documents, business cards, pens, and personal items. The best backpacks provide **specific homes for each category** without being overly complex. Look for features like cable management, RFID-blocking pockets for passports, and quick-access compartments for items you need during flights.

# Professional Appearance

Your backpack becomes part of your professional image. Choose materials and designs that complement your work wardrobe and industry standards. **Leather accents, clean lines, and neutral colors** typically work best in business settings.

# Comfort and Ergonomics

Even the most organized backpack is useless if it's uncomfortable to carry. Look for **padded shoulder straps, breathable back panels, and optional waist belts** for longer carries. Consider how the bag feels when fully loaded, not just when empty.

# Size Guide and Airline Compliance

Most business trips require 3-7 days of clothing plus work essentials. A **35-45L capacity** typically handles this well while remaining carry-on compliant. However, airline restrictions vary:

* **US Domestic**: Generally accommodating for bags under 45L
* **International**: More restrictive, especially budget carriers
* **European/Asian**: Often stricter size limits favor bags under 35L

The key dimensions to watch are **22"" x 14"" x 9""** for US carriers, though these include wheels and handles that don't apply to backpacks. When in doubt, check specific airline restrictions before traveling.

**Pro tip**: Choose bags that compress well when not fully packed, as gate agents often judge by appearance rather than exact measurements.

# Security and Anti-Theft Features

Business travelers often carry valuable electronics and sensitive documents. While no bag is theft-proof, certain features add meaningful security layers:

**RFID-blocking pockets** protect credit cards and passports from electronic skimming. **Lockable zippers** deter opportunistic theft in crowded areas. **Hidden pockets** on the back panel keep valuables against your body.

**Cable locks** allow you to secure your bag to fixed objects in airports, hotels, or co-working spaces. However, remember that **situational awareness and basic precautions** matter more than any security feature.

# Maintenance and Longevity Tips

Quality business travel backpacks represent significant investments that should last for years with proper care:

* **Clean regularly** with appropriate methods for your bag's materials
* **Condition leather** elements to prevent cracking and maintain appearance
* **Check zippers and hardware** periodically for signs of wear
* **Rotate usage** if you own multiple bags to extend lifespan
* **Store properly** when not in use to maintain shape and prevent damage

Many premium brands offer **repair services** that can extend your bag's life significantly beyond typical expectations.

# Final Recommendations: Which Bag Is Right for You?

After extensive testing and real-world use, here's how I'd match these bags to different business traveler profiles:

**For the Organization Enthusiast**: The **Nomatic Travel Bag** remains unbeaten for travelers who carry lots of small items and value having a place for everything. Yes, it's expensive, but the organization system genuinely improves travel efficiency.

**For the Premium Experience Seeker**: The **Peak Design Travel Backpack** offers modular flexibility and premium materials that justify its price for travelers who want one bag for all scenarios.

**For the Practical Professional**: The **Tortuga Travel Pack** delivers excellent functionality and comfort at a more accessible price point without sacrificing essential features.

**For the International Executive**: The **Aer Travel Pack 3** provides the most professional appearance with features that work globally, making it ideal for international business travel.

The right business travel backpack should feel like an extension of your professional toolkit – organized, reliable, and appropriate for any business setting you encounter. Whether you're a road warrior traveling weekly or an occasional business traveler looking to upgrade from a basic bag, investing in quality luggage pays dividends in reduced stress, better organization, and enhanced professional image.

**Coffee Review #03 – The Barn – Juan Martin**

**Date:** Jun 17th, 2025  
**Coffee:** Juan Martin  
**Roaster:** The Barn  
**Country:** Colombia  
**Region:** Cauca  
**Producers:** Finca Juan Martin  
**Process:** Washed  
**Altitude:** 2,050m  
**Varietals:** Gesha  
**Roast Date:** Feb 20th, 2025

**BREW DETAILS**

* **Method:** Pour Over
* **Roast Level:** Light
* **Grinder:** K-Ultra
* **Grind Size:** \#6
* **Dripper:** D27
* **Water Temp:** 200F
* **Ratio:** 1:17

**TASTING NOTES**

The fragrance is pretty muted overall - low intensity with just a little bit of floral notes, not much else coming through.

Once brewed, the aroma intensity sits somewhere between low and medium - it's there but hard to find.

Flavor-wise, I get a little bit of citrus but I'm also picking up some vegetal notes. I'm wondering if I've ground a little bit too fine. I get jasmine on the finish. The acidity is dry at about medium intensity.

The aftertaste is mostly clean, with a definite dryness. The mouthfeel is a bit too heavy for my taste and somewhat masks any positives in the flavor.

Sad, since when I tried it on the #8 grind setting a week ago, I would have scored this much higher. Perhaps in the mid to high 7s. User error for sure.

**SCORE:** 5.1/10

Scoring (t8ke scale for reference below):

1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out  
2 | Poor | I wouldn't consume by choice  
3 | Bad | Multiple flaws  
4 | Sub-par | Not bad, but many things I'd rather have  
5 | Good | Good, just fine  
6 | Very Good | A cut above  
7 | Great | Well above average  
8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional  
9 | Incredible | An all-time favorite  
10 | Perfect | Perfect

1ldsmge,https://www.reddit.com/r/BhubaneswarReads/comments/1ldsmge/digital_bonds_analogue_ache/,"Digital Bonds, Analogue ache","Reddit. An app, a maze, a cultural labyrinth that, for the longest time, felt like Greek to me- abstract, obscure, oddly intimidating. And yet, somehow, within that digital wilderness, I stumbled upon a simple message: a meet-up. Strangers meeting strangers. Curious, I joined. Hope was never the intention. But something remarkable happened… I found people.

Not just doxxed usernames and profile pictures; people. The strangers I met that day? They became constants.And, of course, not all stories stay linear. Disagreements crept in. Some drifted. Some vanished. But those who remained? They made the ordinary sacred. That’s the tax life demands for connection. But the ones who stayed… ah, they became something of a makeshift family. Conversations over coffee, laughter shared over sandwiches and fried chicken wings started to build. The awkward silences? They softened. Banter bloomed. 

And just as it all began to feel like a home I never expected, I left. Delhi called; new chapters, new uncertainties. And now, from this distance, I find myself pausing between pages, missing the ones who made the last chapter worth rereading.

Now, I read their texts in the group, see their photos capturing little flashes of daily life. And I sit alone, in a dimly lit room, thinking- if life hadn’t thrown its weight of responsibility on my shoulders, I’d still be there. Among them. Laughing until I couldn’t breathe. I love them. And I miss them. And maybe that’s the cruelest kind of affection the one that lingers after the moment has passed, asking for nothing, hoping for everything, and quietly promising: if ever the road brings me back, I’ll return.

Ever wake up feeling a bit-off-kilter, like you're just going through the motions? Or maybe you hit that afternoon slump and desperately reach for another coffee, only to feel wired and tired later? We've all been there, trust me. It's easy to feel like you're constantly playing catch-up with your own energy and focus.

But what if I told you that with a few simple, intentional tweaks to your daily routine-your ""ritual""-you could literally transform how you feel, think, and perform? That's what biohacking is all about: taking control of your biology to optimize your life. And you don't need a fancy lab or expensive gadgets to start. It's about small, consistent actions that add up to big results.

Today, we're diving into a practical, step-by-step daily biohacking ritual designed to help you elevate every single day. Think of it as a friendly roadmap to a more vibrant, focused, and energized you. Ready? Let's get started.

## Phase 1: The Biohacker's Dawn - Kickstarting Your Morning

Your morning sets the tone for your entire day. Don't just stumble out of bed; wake up with purpose!

### Step 1: Hydrate Smartly - Before You Even Think About Coffee
First things first, before your feet even hit the floor if possible, grab some water. Your body's been in a fasted state all night, and it's craving hydration.
- **Why it matters**: Rehydrates cells, kickstarts metabolism, and flushes toxins.
- **My tip**: Add a pinch of high-quality sea salt or a squeeze of fresh lemon. This helps replenish electrolytes and gives your digestion a gentle nudge. I've found that this simple act alone makes me feel so much more awake and clear-headed.

### Step 2: Greet the Light - Sunlight Over Screens
Resist the urge to immediately check your phone. Instead, expose your eyes to natural daylight as soon as you can.
- **Why it matters**: Natural light signals to your brain that it's daytime, helping to regulate your circadian rhythm, boost mood, and suppress melatonin.
- **My tip**: Step outside for 5-10 minutes, even if it's cloudy. If going outside isn't an option, open a window and look out. If you're really stuck indoors, a full-spectrum light therapy lamp can be a decent substitute, but nothing beats the real sun.

### Step 3: Gentle Movement & Mindfulness
You don't need a full gym session right away, but some gentle movement helps wake up your body and mind.
- **Why it matters**: Improves circulation, reduces stiffness, and prepares your body for the day. Pairing it with mindfulness helps reduce stress and improve focus.
- **My tip**: Try 5-10 minutes of light stretching, yoga, or even just walking around your home. Follow it up with a few minutes of deep breathing or a short meditation. I personally love a quick gratitude practice here-just thinking of three things I'm thankful for. It's surprisingly powerful.

## Phase 2: Sustaining Your Energy - Midday Mastery

Now that you've got your morning groove on, it's time to keep that momentum going through the busiest part of your day.

### Step 4: Fuel Your Body Right - Nutrient-Dense Meals
What you eat directly impacts your energy, focus, and mood.
- **Why it matters**: Provides sustained energy, prevents sugar crashes, and supports cognitive function.
- **My tip**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods. Think lean protein, healthy fats (like avocado or olive oil), and plenty of colorful vegetables. Minimize refined sugars and processed carbs. I've noticed that when I skip the sugary snacks, I don't get that dreaded mid-afternoon slump.

### Step 5: Strategic Breaks & Movement Snacks
Sitting for hours isn't great for anyone. Incorporate short breaks to reset your mind and body.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents mental fatigue, improves blood flow, and reduces stiffness.
- **My tip**: Every hour or so, get up and move for 5 minutes. Stretch, walk around, or do a few squats. Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work, 5 minutes break) to structure your focus. It's amazing how much more productive you can be with these little ""movement snacks.""

## Phase 3: Evening Wind-Down - Prepping for Peak Sleep

This is where many people drop the ball, but your evening routine is just as crucial as your morning one for optimizing your next day. Sleep isn't just rest; it's active repair and optimization.

### Step 6: Dim the Lights & Ditch the Screens
As evening approaches, start signaling to your body that it's time to wind down.
- **Why it matters**: Artificial light, especially blue light from screens, disrupts melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep.
- **My tip**: About 2-3 hours before bed, dim the lights in your home. Use blue light blocking glasses if you absolutely must use screens. Better yet, swap screen time for a good old-fashioned book, journaling, or listening to calming music. Seriously, this is a game-changer for sleep quality.

### Step 7: The Last Meal Rule & Hydration Check
What and when you eat in the evening significantly impacts your sleep and digestion.
- **Why it matters**: Eating too close to bedtime can lead to indigestion and disrupted sleep.
- **My tip**: Try to finish your last substantial meal at least 2-3 hours before you plan to go to sleep. Keep it light and easy to digest. And do a final hydration check-sip water, but don't chug a gallon right before bed, or you'll be making midnight trips to the bathroom!

### Step 8: Create Your Sleep Sanctuary
Your bedroom should be a haven for rest. Optimize it for deep, restorative sleep.
- **Why it matters**: A comfortable, dark, quiet, and cool environment is essential for quality sleep.
- **My tip**: Ensure your bedroom is as dark as possible (blackout curtains are your friend!), cool (around 65-68 degreesF or 18-20 degreesC is ideal for most), and quiet. Consider a white noise machine if you're in a noisy area. A consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends, also trains your body for better sleep. I've found that investing in a good pillow and mattress is worth every penny too.

## Your Elevated Day Awaits!

There you have it-a simple, actionable daily biohacking ritual you can start implementing today. Remember, biohacking isn't about perfection; it's about progress. Start with one or two steps that resonate with you, integrate them consistently, and then gradually add more. You'll be amazed at how quickly these small, intentional actions can add up to a life that feels more vibrant, focused, and truly optimized.

In the UK. 

So I’ve been terrified of the dentist all my life, a mix of getting it from my dad, a bad experience, and putting it off so long that I make the problem even bigger in my head. I avoided the dentist because I assumed that they would tell me I need all my teeth taken out. 

I finally had enough, and braved my first appointment in 12 years. The dentist was lovely and gentle. 

I’ve also now been to a hygienist for the first time in my life who cleaned my teeth and they told me that my teeth were nowhere near ‘as fun as I was hoping’ when I told her they were going to be horrendous. She said she was impressed I’ve managed to keep them so clean lol. 

I need a root canal and an extraction, but surprisingly that’s it. He said my teeth were in remarkably good condition considering the circumstances. 

I now don’t dread the dentist due to a mix of knowing the state of my teeth, and it not being nearly as bad as I thought. I actually quite like the hygienist. And I’m excited for the prospect of Invisalign in the future. 

But the root canal and extraction absolutely does terrify me. Is there anything I need to know? Will it hurt? Will I be able to feel it all happening? Will I see the actual tooth come out? 

Any advice or comfort or even a reality check is much appreciated. ",2,1750179640.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Let’s just dive into it: Are we really still hanging onto the 9-to-5 grind like it’s the holy grail of working life? I mean, come on! With AI advancing faster than a toddler on a sugar rush, isn’t it time we start thinking about how we can upskill and stay ahead? 🤔 

Picture this: You’re at your desk, coffee in hand, listening to your favorite podcast about the latest AI trends. They casually mention that “in the next five years, many traditional jobs are likely to be replaced by automation.” Your heart sinks for a second. But wait! What if instead, you flipped the script and became the person that *AI* helps, rather than the person it replaces? 

Here’s how you can make that happen:

**1. Embrace Lifelong Learning**  
This might sound cliché, but it’s like one of those “if you don’t learn, you’ll get left behind” scenarios. Take advantage of online courses. Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or even good ol’ YouTube have tons of resources! 

**2. Find Your Niche**  
What do you love? What are you curious about? When you nail down what you’re passionate about, it’s way easier to find relevant skills to learn. Whether it’s coding, content creation, or digital marketing, just follow your curiosity. It’s like a treasure map! 🗺️

**3. Build a Personal Brand**  
In the age of social media, being “you” is your biggest asset. Share projects, insights, or even your learning journey! It’s not just about showing off; it’s about connecting with a community. You never know who might see your work!

**4. Network, Network, Network!**  
Before you roll your eyes, hear me out. Networking isn’t just for the corporate ladder climbers. It’s about building relationships. Attend webinars, join online forums (Hey, this one! 🙌), and connect with people in your field. You might just find your next opportunity waiting for you in a DM.

**5. Stay Up-to-Date on AI Trends**  
Let’s be real, the future is coming whether we’re ready or not. So why not be proactive? Subscribe to newsletters, join relevant subreddits (like this community, wink wink), and stay in the loop. Knowledge is power, my friends! 💪

**And listen**, it's okay to feel overwhelmed. I mean, who wouldn’t? But here's the kicker: instead of letting that anxiety hold you back, let it fuel your motivation! Think about all the possibilities out there once you arm yourself with new skills. 

So many of us have been conditioned to think we need to stick to our “9-to-5s” for life. But let’s be real—jobs are changing, and fast! Are we going to chase after old norms, or are we going to adapt and thrive? I say we take the plunge!

What are the skills you're excited to explore? Are you already bidding adieu to the traditional work setup? Let’s keep this convo rolling! 🌊",1,1750179504.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

It's like you designed it to murder laptops. Do you even test your shit? Or are you too busy sipping overpriced coffee in your hipster office to notice? Fix this crap already, you lazy pricks.
* **Windows Development? Abandoned Like a Stray Dog**: You hyped up Arc for Windows, got everyone’s hopes up, then fucking bailed. What, did you just decide it wasn’t worth your precious time? Pathetic. You left users hanging, and now we’re stuck with a half-assed browser that’s barely supported. Real classy move, assholes.
* **Android Beta? A Fucking Insult**: Oh, wow, you released an Android beta. Big fucking whoop. It’s been sitting there, collecting digital dust, untouched and unloved. You think tossing out a half-baked beta excuses your negligence? We’re not your goddamn beta testers for eternity. Finish the job or admit you’re too incompetent to handle it.
* **Dia Obsession While Arc Festers**: Instead of fixing Arc’s glaring issues, you’re jerking off to your shiny new Dia project. What, you think you can just abandon your flagship browser for some new toy? Arc’s rotting, and you’re too busy chasing the next big thing to give a shit. Prioritise, you spineless opportunists.
* **Non-Open Source? A Middle Finger to the Community**: Intentionally keeping Arc closed-source is a fucking power trip. You know about Zen Browser, don’t you? Yeah, those folks are eating your lunch with an open-source alternative that actually respects users. But you? You’re too busy gatekeeping to care. Arrogant pricks.

I’m still using Arc, not because you deserve my loyalty, but because I’m a sentimental idiot clinging to fading hopes. Don’t you dare take that for granted, you self-entitled fuckwits.

2. I'm not sure if I should use the same frame for all my photos or if it's okay to use vintage ones I get from antique stores/thrift shops and have a more eclectic feel?

3. Should I price/sell the prints? I never got into this hobby with the expectation of selling photos, I just enjoy doing it.

4. Any advice for things I could be missing/how did your first art show go?

Breville Bambino arrives today or tomorrow, our first machine.  Selected for friendly budget, rapid heatup and small size.  can't wait to get started, and I know the accessory purchases will follow shortly for an unpressurized basket at the very least.

Grinder has already arrived, (amazon) Shardor Precision 51 step grinder is sitting on the table.

Crap!  I need to get coffee now!  We won't be drinking any more utility kcups in the morning, but I'm looking for a weekday morning coffee that isn't going to break the bank to get my feet wet while working on getting things dialed in.

A nice easy medium/dark roast, readily available for day to day.

Also looking for a great source or subscription service that won't break the bank.  There are so many coffee shops in and around Brampton/Toronto and I'm trying to stop at a few of them to sample and check prices, but I probably should have been doing that the whole time.

I vape like my life depends on it... Commercial break? vape time.  .. Morning coffee?  vape time.  I'm outdoors?  Vape time. I'm indoors? Discreet vape time.  Goin to take a crap?  bringin vape & phone.  
Its bad, i'm ashamed and I HATE my dependency... being an otherwise health conscious person.  Its been about 6 years... I was weaning off of cigarettes  but this is WAY worse! There are just too few setbacks to nursing the plastic cartridges... having a mild panic attack when the % gets low..  I tried to reduce over time for about 2 yrs now with no success...   
  
Got \~ 150$ in nicotine patches/ lozenges / gum + a buttload of candies (taste + mouth preoccupation).  Slapped on a patch last night (had some crazy wild dreams!) and noticed within \~30m that the desire reduced significantly!  Suffering some nausea & awful sleep but hell, its worth it to me... even if it means weeks of this.  This morning (first day), Im still puffing here and there but the desire is reduced and I want to keep that going, even if it means nausea & bad sleep... 

So I'm thinking I should keep a patch stuck on me 24/7 until I am off of it... supplement with gum / lozenges throughout the day.    
  
 I dont know if its ok to mix these, or if its bad to keep a patch on for that long... (would mixing make the nausea worse?).  Would a gum + patch be too much?  Are there side effects?  I'm on 21mg patches... is that too much hence nausea?  Can I cut the patch in half?  Did gum / lozenges work better for anyone else?  Will the urges continue to decline if I just puff less with the patch?  Looking for anything that doesnt involve soul searching for willpower to go cold turkey.   I have sooo many questions!  

Sincere thanks again

So I’m looking for other nootropics that offer similar mood and motivation benefits, but without the risk of interfering with my sleep if taken later in the day. I would like to note the effects of caffeine also don't last too long for me.

I went home that day with the biggest grin on my face. That night, I treated my sister and dad to a simple dinner at our favorite pizza place. Nothing fancy. But it felt different.

My Queen

 If you’re in bed and you look to your right and the man you love is no longer there, just a window this letter is for you my Queen!


There are moments in life when words feel too small for the depth of what’s in our hearts. Today I’ll try, because you deserve to hear it, feel it, and know it with every part of you:

My god I’m so in love with you.
Not just in passing, not just in habit, not just in word, but in a way that fills every corner of my soul. If love is a language, then you are every word I’ve ever wanted to learn, every phrase I’ve ever needed to speak fluently.  There were times when I spoke your language effortlessly, your back arched on suspense!

Two years ago, something rare and sacred happened: we found each other. And I truly believe we were always meant to, just not before we were ready. “We are not the same people we were then,” as F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote. “We are stronger, better, and more able to choose love, again.”

You once told me that my words and my actions didn’t align and you were right. I see that now, and I am deeply sorry for the ways I let my own wounds, assumptions, and silence speak louder than the truth of my heart. I should have lifted you up, cherished you like the queen you are. I should have gotten up early just to make you coffee, washed your car without asking, loved you not just aloud, but actively. Beautiful love lives in the little things, and I failed to see how powerful those small acts really were to my Queen!

You are so fiercely independent, yet you desperately yearn to be held and touched softly!  You are so brilliantly resilient, yet you’re as fragile as glass forged from fire! None of those things should have stopped me from doing what I could to lighten your load without being asked. You shouldn’t have had to ask nor tell me. I should have just known. I thought saying “I love you” all the time was enough, because I never wanted to leave this world without you knowing. But now I realize that words, when not backed by presence, can become echoes instead of anchors.

You filled my life with colors I thought only existed in movies and I used to not believe in real life love stories, until you walked into ours.
“You and I, it’s as though we have been taught to kiss in heaven and sent down to Earth together,” Rumi said. “To see if we know what we were taught.”
I may have forgot the lessons for a minute. But I promise you, I’m remembering now.

We both carry scars from our pasts, and no child escapes life unscathed. I wish we had shown more grace to each other’s wounds, more patience to each other’s silence, more understanding to each other’s fears. I’ve come to see that healing isn’t a solo act—it’s something love makes possible, together.

I now understand what true love and partnership means:
	•	Listening without trying to fix.
	•	Asking instead of assuming.
	•	Protecting each other’s peace.
	•	Creating a soft place to land.
	•	Validating feelings without defense.
	•	Respecting triggers, not dismissing them.
	•	Encouraging growth, not fearing it.

We came into this love from long journeys, both of us having known a version of love before, But this!  What we have, is something else entirely. It’s love not just built on a foundation, chemistry or comfort, but on conscious choice.

If I had handled things differently, maybe we’d already be engaged, but what I know now is that we still have a chance to write the rest of this story, better, stronger, and more beautifully than before.

We both know I don’t deserve to ask, this one question and your answer will be taken with the full weight as you give it!  Either way!  Afford me this one last chance, my love, my Queen?
To show you that the man I am today, the one who has sat in silence and frustration with his therapist, wrestled with his ego and his demons!  Has finally stopped trying to fix, what he didn’t understand.  Is the man who can finally see the one true you. The man who has grown into the one you always deserved.

Let’s learn from the past, but live only in the present. Let’s create a future that is so beautiful, it makes the pain we have endured worthwhile. I believe in us, in you, in the love we share, the pull we have, the destiny that awaits us and in what is supposed to be will always be!

“I have waited for this opportunity for more than half my life,” said Maya Angelou, “to be able to tell you how much I love you.”
I love you more deeply than words can carry and I promise you this, I will spend every day for the rest of my life!  Proving to you that the love I have for you will never fade or flatten in the face of time!

This lifetime, and whatever comes next, I choose you my Queen!

This is perhaps a stretch as I am fairly new to them too. Consequently I'm doing a lot of prep for a session that I would like to GM - the Haunted House scenario.

You may find it a bit formulaic and camp but that is intentional given the genre. Please give me some (hopefully constructive) critiquer and advice. 


## MotW - The Haunted House - intro script
It is 1986. We find ourselves moving along a very straight, dirt-road in America’s mid-west. The sky is overcast and there is a storm on the horizon, its clouds bruise-blue and purple.

We approach an open gate, pass through and move towards an old, rambling house. The house could use some TLC, but overall looks to be in a reasonable state. The yard is well maintained but rather ordinary.

We pass through the front door and enter the house. The foyer is dimly lit. We see a staircase going up in the centre of the hallway and a passageway to it’s left and a open door on our right. 

We turn to the right and go through the open doorway and enter the parlour.

We see a TV showing the local evening news. The volume is low but audible. A stressed and anxious-looking man sits on an overstuffed sofa watching the tv distractedly with a tense,  determined look on his face. He has red, hollow eyes and a 5-day stubble.

A woman stands close by. She’s wearing a dark maroon coloured dress and flat shoes, and has a vacant look on her face. Her head is slightly tilted and she seems to be swaying.

As we get closer to the woman we see that something isn’t right. We quickly pan to a coffee table, zooming in and see a prescription pill jar, lidless and on it’s side. A couple of pills have fallen out. We pan back to the woman and zoom in on her face. 

Her face is ashen, and she is drooling, her eyes heavy-lidded. She is swaying slightly as if she is trying hard not to fall over. She fails. We see her topple forwards, her upper body hitting the sofa on its way to the floor. She is unconscious.

The man gets up, and walking backwards begins to drag the woman under her arms towards the door and into the foyer. We follow and see him enter the passageway to the left of the stairs, He opens the door to the basement and as we look over his shoulder we see concrete steps heading down into darkness. *(Show photo cellar.png)* The man drags her to the top of the stairs and we see him throw her down. Her limp body clatters, bumps and bangs as it makes its way out of shot and to the bottom of the stairs. 

The camera remains still as we watch the man descend the staircase and we lose sight of him. A light comes on in the basement, illuminating the whitewashed walls of the stairwell. We hear him moving around and soon hear the sound of a small motor as its starter cord is pulled. It doesn’t catch immediately. On the fifth or sixth pull the motor screams into life and we hear the classic horror-movie sound of a chainsaw. The sound rises to an angry crescendo and we see a large splatter of red liquid splash up the whitewashed walls. The camera fades to black, chainsaw screaming all the while.

So I was sitting out in the garden enjoying the sun when I noticed this little fella looking at me curiously on the table. When I realised it’s a jumping spider I was stoked. 

I slowly started offering it my finger and it actually decided to climb on me! I let it go after a short while and fetched an old glass container from some coffee or whatever and made him a little enclosure with grass, sticks, leaves and such and I also dropped a few droplets of water along the walls. I let him walk on me again and put him carefully inside his new home.

A few moments later I managed to whack a fly, I removed its wings and dropped the newly acquired dinner inside the enclosure for my new buddy to enjoy. 

So far the jumpie is standing still, I guess taking in all that’s happened. I hope he’ll like his enclosure and hopefully eat the fly. Worst case scenario if he doesn’t like his new home, I’ll let him go. 

When I was a kid, I was scared of even the smallest daddy long legs, my parents had to remove them from the bathroom and such or I wouldn’t step in. So for a former arachnophobic like me, this is great experience and an opportunity to learn more about spiders and get more used to them!

I tried my hardest to get some good photos but it’s incredibly challenging, this is the best I could take. 

I would also like to use this opportunity to thank everyone in this sub for helping me slowly but surely overcome my fear of spiders through all the cuteness and interesting facts I found here!

Looking for tips as I have experience but never this long and want to be as safe as possible. I did a lot of research and general advice is to start slow and no carbs pretty much.   
  
I am nowhere near starvation mode though as I went from 291 lbs to 243 lbs should end at 230 something pounds which hopefully I kept as much muscle as possible. I don't want to fear refeed but respect it so I've been doing a lot of research just to do it right and would appreciate any tips/advice.

Been doing simply water with electrolytes, salt potassium and magnesium. No vitamins, occasional black coffee or yerba mate obviously nothing added.  


I have a lot of experience with fasting 7,10, and 15 days but this is the longest I ever gone. So far it's been more of a mental game than anything. I have been working out and it's been tough. I squat/deadlift 225 lbs down from 365/405 lbs for 5 reps with the intention not to create a tear but to signal the body to keep muscle. Also walks etc. Trying to stay active. Some days have been really tough but I have continued the routine as I have been consistent for a year and didn't want to break the habit with this 40 day fast. So I have not skipped a beat and kept working out, again with a lot less weight percentage wise but working out nonetheless. Sometimes EGO hurts more as people see you can only lift that lol but that's been a part of the journey experience spiritually to let go completely. 

Will add progress pics on the 24th

Is that a normal amount of coffee or is that too much for a single cup of coffee? I also tried just putting in a half a table spoon or half of the 15 ml spoon and the coffee basically tastes the same. So is a table spoon or 15 ml the right amount of coffee that I should be using in a k-cup?",1,1750178221.0,keurig,3,1.0,False

In June we read “The Two Admonitions of the ‘Devadatta’ Chapter—A Call To Lead All People to Enlightenment, based on the Teachings of Changing Poison into Medicine. Devadatta and Sgiwhistleblower Friends","*First, from “MY Fantasy Life” (thank you, Eigenstien @Sgiwhistleblowers) living in the Fantasy RV Park (what Secret-Entrance @Sgiwhistleblowers delightfully calls “Dog Park”) with My Fantasy Polyamorous Partners and Five Fantasy Kids:*

*I am writing this with the informed consent of a friend who is also in substance recovery. She is part of a research cohort exploring the role of laughter, something called the “tears-to-laugh” ratio, and “Laughter Yoga” in recovery. Part of the study involves random pings throughout the day. She and other participants simply have to respond “yes” or “no” to the question of “Have you laughed in the past 5 minutes?” We both agree that she seems so much happier since this study began. I participate in meetings with her about three times each week. There is no doubt that her laughs are spreading to our group!*

*And about the power of laughter in the very worst of times, d asked me to link to this [article in the Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/14/find-joy-in-everything-election-monitor-grigory-melkonyants-last-word-in-court-a89064) about a Gregory Melkonyants who laughs as an expression of hope.*

*“Mama Julie, let’s race!” The Twinettes and I race almost every single day and since we began, for some reason they win 80% of the time. We raced yesterday as well. But this time I REALLY made effort to skate fast for those designated wins!*

Today I am finishing the third section, “Even Icchantikas Can Attain Buddhahood through the Mystic Principle of Changing Poison into Medicine.” 

Daisaku Ikeda writes:

>*Myo* has three meanings: “to open,” “to be fully endowed” and “to revive.” Explaining how those who had been despised in the pre-Lotus Sutra teachings—persons of the two vehicles, icchantikas and women—can attain Buddhahood through the Lotus Sutra, Nichiren writes, “*Myo* means to revive, that is, to return to life” (WND-1, 149). He also says, “The Lotus Sutra … can cure the dead as well as the living, and therefore it has the character*myo* [mystic or wondrous] in its title [Myoho-renge-kyo]” (WND-1, 149).

>Here, “the dead” refers to the condition of persons of the two vehicles and the icchantika, who had allowed their Buddha nature to wither and die on account of attachment to mistaken beliefs, ideas and teachings. The Lotus Sutra has the power to revive even the lives of such people. This is because the Lotus Sutra serves as the ultimate elixir for revitalizing and reactivating the Buddha nature. That is why “The Life Span of the Thus Come One,” the 16th chapter, describes the sutra as “a highly effective medicine” (LSOC, 269).

I think “to revive” is a brilliant concept. My miserable childhood and youth riddled by HS now seem like they were in the far distant past. Ditto those Airbnbs in Brooklyn, Paris, and Berlin where the porn vids were shot: the memory has shrunk and the pain has disappeared. Now I remember the actors and behind-the-camera people just as friends who went off for coffee and beer after work. Most of us still drop each other a line every now and then. Yes, we have gained a few pounds, work in normal boring jobs, and have families. My life has revived to the point that the shame is gone.

Sensei writes:

>In the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni and Many Treasures, as well as all Buddhas and bodhisattvas gathered at the assembly from throughout the universe, praise the Mystic Law that led them to enlightenment and rejoice at revealing their Buddha nature through the power of that Law. They also vow to guide all people to enlightenment and devote themselves to this great undertaking with the spirit of not begrudging their lives.

I do and shall work more on the “praise” and “rejoice” themes. It’s OK, I’m a work-in-progress. But from morning to night, I live with the “vow” just as described above. No, I don’t begrudge my life at all!

Dr. Ikeda:

>Indeed, it could be said that the whole purpose of the Lotus Sutra is to inspire people to bring forth their Buddha nature. The sutra is like a paean to the Buddha nature. Thus, when people hear it, when their lives encounter the sublime symphony of the Mystic Law and the noble life states of bodhisattva and Buddhahood, no matter how steeped they may be in evil or misery, they can awaken their innate Buddha nature. The Lotus Sutra teaches that even a person of immense evil such as Devadatta is not excluded.

This “sublime symphony of the Mystic Law and the noble life states of bodhisattva and Buddhahood” is *CONTAGIOUS!* Bernie and Artie were our nemeses two years ago; now we are the closest of friends and we akk work together at the RV Park and Longhouse Elem. Who works the hardest here? The Fam Four? Bernie & Artie? The Three Sisters? Chima? The Dewey’s? The Kim’s? The Maracles? Rex? The students? It’s not even possible to weigh. Some of us chant, some don’t. Still, I feel we are dealing with lots of innate Buddha natures!

Nichiren had such a poetic heart!

>In “The Opening of the Eyes,” Nichiren writes that the Lotus Sutra’s prediction of Devadatta’s future enlightenment is proof that an icchantika can in fact attain Buddhahood. Moreover, he says that Devadatta’s example indicates the potential for all evil people in the Latter Day to gain this supreme state of life, as well. He sums up by saying, “Poison turns into sweet dew, the finest of all flavors” (WND-1, 268).

From the time I awaken to the time I go to sleep, I feel like that poison in my life has turned into “sweet dew.” After school and on the way to the skating rink, Dei, our newest student, said, “I just like it here at Longhouse Elem!” That’s the finest of all flavors!

Daisaku Ikeda concludes this section:

>Devadatta’s attainment of Buddhahood serves as actual proof of the principle of changing poison into medicine found in the Lotus Sutra.

I know that some dudes can get finessed like that but I made a boundary when I told her that I am not comfortable with making money in that way I rather get clean.

She couldn't breathe. She had some other clothes - a few - but they were last-choice clothes, oh-my-God-wouldn't-be-caught-dead clothes. Pants that were too short and made her look like a hick, shirts that were too big and too stupid, and made her look like her mom had picked them out. And she had.  
  
  Claire had about three hundred dollars left to last her for, well, months, after the latest round of calling out for pizza and buying yet another book for Professor Clueless Euliss, who didn't seem to have figured out yet what subject he was teaching.  
  
  She supposed she could find some clothes, if she looked around, that wouldn't totally blow her entire budget. After all, downtown Morganville, Texas, was the thrift shop capital of the world. Assuming she could find anything she could stand to wear.  
  
  Mom said this would happen, she thought. I just have to think. Keep my cool.  
  
  Claire threw herself into an orange plastic chair, dumped her backpack on the scratched linoleum, and put her head in her hands. Her face felt hot, and she was shaking, and she knew, just knew, that she was going to cry. Cry like the baby they all said she was, too young to be here, too young to be away from Mommy.  
  
  It sucked to be smart, because this was where it got you.  
  
  She gulped deep, damp breaths and sat back, willing herself not to bawl (because they'd hear), and wondered if she could call Mom and Dad for an extension on her allowance, or use the credit card that was ""just for emergencies. ""  
  
  Then she saw the note. Not so much ""note"" as graffiti, but it was addressed to her, on the painted cinder-block wall above the machines.  
  
  DEAR DORK, it read, WE FOUND TRASH IN THE MACHINES AND THREW IT DOWN THE CHUTE. IF YOU WANT IT, DIVE FOR IT.  
  
  ""Shit,"" she breathed, and had to blink back tears again, for an entirely different reason. Blind, stupid rage.  
  
  Monica. Well, Monica and the Monickettes, anyway. Why was it the hot mean girls always ran in packs, like hyenas? And why, with all the shimmery hair and long tanned legs and more of Daddy's money than Daddy's accountants, did they have to focus on her?  
  
  No, she knew the answer to that.  
  
  She'd made Monica look stupid in front of her friends, and some hot upperclassmen. Not that it had been all that hard; she'd just been walking by, heard Monica saying that World War II had been ""that dumbass Chinese war thing. ""  
  
  And by simple reflex, she'd said, ""It wasn't. "" The whole lot of them, slouched all over the couches in the dorm lobby, looked at her with as much blank surprise as if the Coke machine had just spoken up.  
  
  Monica, her friends, three of the cool older frat boys.  
  
  ""World War II,"" Claire had plunged on, panicked and not quite sure how to get out of what she'd gotten herself into. ""I just meant - well, it wasn't the Korean War. That was later. World War II was with the Germans and the Japanese. You know, Pearl Harbor?""  
  
  And the guys had looked at Monica and laughed, and Monica had flushed - not much, but enough to ruin the cool perfection of her makeup. ""Remind me not to buy any history papers off of you,"" the cutest of the guys had said. ""What kind of dumbass doesn't know that?"" Though Claire had been sure none of them had, really. ""Chinese. Riiiiight. ""  
  
  Claire had seen the fury in Monica's eyes, quickly covered over with smiles and laughter and flirting.  
  
  Claire had ceased to exist again, for the guys.  
  
  For the girls, she was brand-new, and unwelcome as hell. She'd been dealing with it all her life. Smart and small and average-looking wasn't exactly winning the life lottery; you had to fight for it, whatever it was. Somebody was always laughing at, or hitting, or ignoring you, or a combination of the first two.  
  
  She'd thought when she was a kid that getting laughed at was the worst thing, and then - after the first couple of school-yard showdowns - getting hit jumped up to number one. But for most of her (brief, two-year) high school experience, being ignored was worse by far. She'd gotten there a year earlier than everybody else, and left a year ahead of them. Nobody liked that.  
  
  Nobody but teachers, anyway.  
  
  The problem was that Claire really loved school. Loved books, and reading, and learning things - okay, not calculus, but pretty much everything else. Physics. What normal girl loved physics? Abnormal ones.  
  
  Ones who were not ever going to be hot.  
  
  And face it, being hot? That was what life was all about. As Monica had proved, when the world had wobbled off its axis for a few seconds to notice Claire, and then wobbled right back to revolve around the pretty ones.  
  
  It wasn't fair. She'd dived in and worked her ass off through high school. Graduated with a perfect 4. 0, scored high enough on the tests to qualify for admission to the great schools, the legendary schools, the ones where being a brainiac mutant girl-freak wasn't necessarily a downside. (Except that, of course, at those schools, there were probably hot tall leggy brainiac mutant girl-freaks. ) Didn't matter. Mom and Dad had taken one look at the stack of enthusiastic thumbs-up replies from universities like MIT and Caltech and Yale, and clamped down hard. No way was their sixteen-year-old daughter (nearly seventeen, she kept insisting, although it wasn't really true) going to run off three thousand miles to go to school. At least not at first. (Claire had tried, unsuccessfully, to get across the concept that if anything would kill her budding academic career worse than being a transfer student at one of those places, it was being a transfer student from Texas Prairie University. Otherwise known as TPEwwwwwww. )  
  
  So here she was, stuck on the crappy top floor of a crappy dorm in a crappy school where eighty percent of the students transferred after the first two years - or dropped out - and the Monickettes were stealing her wet laundry and dumping it down the trash chute, all because Monica couldn't be bothered to know anything about one of the world wars big enough to rate a Roman numeral.  
  
  But it isn't fair! something in her howled. I had a plan! An actual plan! Monica slept late, and Claire had gotten up early just to do laundry while all the party crowd was comatose and the studious crowd was off to classes. She'd thought she could leave it for a couple of minutes to grab her shower - another scary experience - and she'd never even thought about anybody doing something so incredibly low.  
  
  As she bit back her sobs, she noticed - again - how quiet it was up here. Creepy and deserted, with half the girls deep asleep and the other half gone. Even when it was crowded and buzzing, the dorm was creepy, though. Old, decrepit, full of shadows and corners and places mean girls could lurk. In fact, that summed up the whole town. Morganville was sma  
ll and old and dusty, full of creepy little oddities. Like the fact that the streetlights worked only half the time, and they were too far apart when they did. Like the way the people in the local campus stores seemed too happy. Desperately happy. Like the fact that the whole town, despite the dust, was clean - no trash, no graffiti, nobody begging for spare change in alleyways.  
  
  Weird.  
  
  She could almost hear her mother saying, Honey, it's just that you're in a strange place. It'll get better.  
  
  You'll just have to try harder.  
  
  Mom always said things like that, and Claire had always done her best to hide how hard it was to follow that advice.  
  
  Well. Nothing to do but try to get her stuff back.  
  
  Claire gulped a couple more times, wiped her eyes, and hauled the arm-twisting weight of her backpack up and over her shoulder. She stared for a few seconds at the wet pair of panties and one sock clutched in her right hand, then hastily unzipped the front pocket of the backpack and stuffed them in. Man, that would kill whatever cool she had left, if she walked around carrying those.  
  
  ""Well,"" said a low, satisfied voice from the open door opposite the stairs, ""look who it is. The Dumpster diver. ""  
  
  Claire stopped, one hand on the rusted iron railing. Something was telling her to run, but something always told her that: fight-or-flight - she'd read the textbooks. And she was tired of flighting. She turned around slowly, as Monica Morrell stepped out of the dorm room - not hers, so she'd busted Erica's lock again. Monica's running buddies Jennifer and Gina filed out and took up flanking positions. Soldiers in flip-flops and low-rise jeans and French manicures.  
  
  Monica struck a pose. It was something she was good at, Claire had to admit. Nearly six feet tall, Monica had flowing, shiny black hair, and big blue eyes accented with just the right amount of liner and mascara. Perfect skin. One of those model-shaped faces, all cheekbones and pouty lips. And if she had a model's body, it was a Victoria's Secret model, all curves, not angles.  
  
  She was rich, she was pretty, and as far as Claire could tell, it didn't make her a bit happy. What did, though - what made those big blue eyes glow right now - was the idea of tormenting Claire just a little more.  
  
  ""Shouldn't you be in first period at the junior high by now?"" Monica asked. ""Or at least getting your first period?""  
  
  ""Maybe she's looking for the clothes she left lying around,"" Gina piled on, and laughed. Jennifer laughed with her. Claire swore their eyes, their pretty jewel-colored eyes, just glowed with the joy of making her feel like shit. ""Litterbug!""  
  
  ""Clothes?"" Monica folded her arms and pretended to think. ""You mean, like those rags we threw away?  
  
  The ones she left cluttering up the washer?""  
  
  ""Yeah, those. ""  
  
  ""I wouldn't wear those to sweat in. ""  
  
  ""I wouldn't wear them to scrub out the boys' toilet,"" Jennifer blurted.  
  
  Monica, annoyed, turned and shoved her. ""Yeah, you know all about the boys' toilet, don't you? Didn't you do Steve Gillespie in ninth grade in there?"" She made sucking sounds, and they all laughed again, though Jennifer looked uncomfortable. Claire felt her cheeks flare red, even though it wasn't - for a change - a dis against her. ""Jeez, Jen, Steve Gillespie? Keep your mouth shut if you can't think of something that won't embarrass yourself. ""  
  
  Jennifer - of course - turned her anger on a safer target. Claire. She lunged forward and shoved Claire back a step, toward the stairs. ""Go get your stupid clothes already! I'm sick of looking at you, with your pasty skin - ""  
  
  ""Yeah, Junior High, ever heard of sunshine?"" Gina rolled her eyes.  
  
  ""Watch it,"" Monica snapped, which was odd, because all three of them had the best tans money could buy.  
  
  Claire scrambled to steady herself. The heavy backpack pulled her off-balance, and she grabbed on to the banister. Jen lunged at her again and slammed the heel of her hand painfully hard into Claire's collarbone. ""Don't!"" Claire yelped, and batted Jen's hand away. Hard.  
  
  There was a second of breathless silence, and then Monica said, very quietly, ""Did you just hit my friend, you stupid little bitch? Where do you think you get off, doing things like that around here?""  
  
  And she stepped forward and slapped Claire across the face, hard enough to draw blood, hard enough to make flares and comets streak across Claire's vision, hard enough to make everything turn red and boiling hot.  
  
  Claire let go of the banister and slapped Monica right back, full across her pouty mouth, and for just a tight, white-hot second she actually felt good about it, but then Monica hissed like a scorched cat, and Claire had time to think, Oh crap, I really shouldn't have done that.  
  
  She never saw the punch coming. Didn't even really feel the impact, except as a blank sensation and confusion, but then the weight of her backpack on her shoulder was pulling her to one side and she staggered.  
  
  She almost caught herself, and then Gina, grinning spitefully, reached over and shoved her backward, down the stairs, and there was nothing but air behind her.  
  
  She hit the edge of every stair, all the way to the bottom. Her backpack broke open and spilled books as she tumbled, and at the top of the stairs Monica and the Monickettes laughed and hooted and high-fived, but she saw it only in disconnected little jerks of motion, freeze-frames.  
  
  It seemed to take forever before she skidded to a stop at the bottom, and then her head hit the wall with a nasty, meaty sound, and everything went black.  
  
  She later remembered only one more thing, in the darkness: Monica's voice, a low and vicious whisper.  
  
  ""Tonight. You'll get what's coming to you, you freak. I'm going to make sure. ""  
  
  It seemed like seconds, but when she woke up again there was somebody kneeling next to her, and it wasn't Monica or her nail-polish mafia; it was Erica, who had the room at the top of the stairs, four doors down from Claire's. Erica looked pale and strained and scared, and Claire tried to smile, because that was what you did when somebody was scared. She didn't hurt until she moved, and then her head started to throb. There was a red-hot ache near the top, and when she reached up to touch it she felt a hard raised knot. No blood, though. It hurt worse when she probed the spot, but not in an oh-my-God-skull-fracture kind of way, or at least that was what she hoped.  
  
  ""Are you okay?"" Erica asked, waving her hands kind of helplessly in midair as Claire wiggled her way up to a sitting position against the wall. Claire risked a quick look past her up the stairs, then down. The coast looked Monica-clear. Nobody else had come out to see what was up, either - most of them were afraid of getting in trouble, and the rest just flat didn't care.  
  
  ""Yeah,"" she said, and managed a shaky laugh. ""Guess I tripped. ""  
  
  ""You need to go to the quack shack?"" Which was college code for the university clinic. ""Or, God, an ambulance or whatever?""  
  
  ""No. No, I'm okay. "" Wishful thinking, but although basically everything in her body hurt like hell, nothing felt like it had broken into pieces. Claire got to her feet, winced at a sore ankle, and picked up her backpack. Notebooks tumbled out. Erica grabbed a couple and jammed them back in, then ran lightly up a few steps to gather the scattered textbooks. ""Damn, Claire, do you really need all this crap? How many classes do you have in a day?""  
  
  ""Six. ""  
  
  ""You're nuts. "" Erica, good deed done, reverted to the neutrality that all the noncool girls in the dorm had shown her so far. ""Better get to the quack shack, seriously. You look like crap. ""  
  
  Claire pasted on a smile and kept it there until Erica got to the top of the stairs and started complaining about the broken lock on her dorm room.  
  
  Tonight, Monica had leaned over and whispered. You'll get what's coming to you, you freak. She hadn't called anybody, or tried to find out if Claire had a broken neck. She didn't care if Claire died.  
  
  No, that was wrong. The problem was, she did care.  
  
  Claire tasted blood. Her lip was split, and it was bleeding. She wiped at the mess with the back of her hand, then the hem of her T-shirt before realizing  
that it was literally the only thing she had to wear. I need to go down to the basement and get my clothes out of the trash. The idea of going down there - going anywhere alone in this dorm - suddenly terrified her. Monica was waiting. And the other girls wouldn't do anything. Even Erica, who was probably the nicest one in the whole place, was scared to come right out on her side. Hell, Erica got hassled, too, but she was probably just as glad that Claire was there to get the worst of it. This wasn't just as bad as high school, where she'd been treated with contempt and casual cruelty - this was worse, a lot worse. And she didn't even have any friends here. Erica was about the best she'd been able to come up with, and Erica was more concerned about her broken door than Claire's broken head.  
  
  She was alone. And if she hadn't been before, she was scared now. Really, really scared. What she'd seen in the Monica Mafia's eyes today wasn't just the usual lazy menace of cool girls versus the geeks; this was worse. She'd gotten casual shoves or pinches before, trips, mean laughter, but this was more like lions coming in for the kill.  
  
  They're going to kill me.  
  
  She started shakily down the flights of stairs, every step a wincing pain through her body, and remembered that she'd slapped Monica hard enough to leave a mark.  
  
  Yeah. They're going to kill me.  
  
  If Monica ended up with a bruise on that perfect face, there wasn't any question about it.

**Chapter Two**  
 Erica was right about the quack shack being the logical first stop; Claire got her ankle wrapped, an ice pack, and some frowns over the forming bruises. Nothing broken, but she was going to be black-and-blue for days. The doctor asked some pro forma questions about boyfriends and stuff, but since she could truthfully say that no, her boyfriend hadn't beaten her up, he just shrugged and told her to watch her step.  
  
  He wrote her an excuse note, too, and gave her some painkillers and told her to go home.  
  
  No way was she going back to the dorm. Truth was, she didn't have much in the room - some books, a few photos of home, some posters. . . . She hadn't even had a chance to call it home, and for whatever reason, she'd never really felt safe there. It had always felt like. . . a warehouse. A warehouse for kids who were, one way or another, going to leave.  
  
  She limped over to the Quad, which was a big empty concrete space with some rickety old benches and picnic tables, cornered on all sides by squat, unappealing buildings that mostly just looked like boxes with windows. Architecture-student projects, probably. She heard a rumor that one of them had fallen down a few years back, but then, she'd also heard rumors about a janitor getting beheaded in the chem lab and haunting the building, and zombies roaming the grounds after dark, so she wasn't putting too much stock in it.  
  
  It was midafternoon already, and not a lot of students were hanging around the Quad, with its lack of shade - great design, considering that the weather was still hovering up in the high nineties in September.  
  
  Claire picked up a campus paper from the stand, carefully took a seat on the blazing-hot bench, and opened it to the ""Housing"" section. Dorm rooms were out of the question; Howard Hall and Lansdale Hall were the only two that took in girls under twenty. She wasn't old enough to qualify for the coed dorms. Stupid rules were probably written when girls wore hoopskirts, she thought, and skipped the dorm listings until she got to OFF CAMPUS. Not that she was really allowed to be living off campus; Mom and Dad would have a total freak-out over it, no question. But. . . if it was between Monica and parental freakage, she'd take the latter. After all, the important thing was to get herself someplace where she felt safe, where she could study.  
  
  Right?  
  
  She dug in her backpack, found her cell phone, and checked for coverage. It was kind of lame in Morganville, truthfully, out in the middle of the prairie, in the middle of Texas, which was about as middle of nowhere as it was possible to get unless you wanted to go to Mongolia or something. Two bars. Not great, but it'd do.  
  
  Claire started dialing numbers. The first person told her that they'd already found somebody, and hung up before she could even say, ""Thanks. "" The second one sounded like a weird old guy. The third one was a weird old lady. The fourth one. . . well, the fourth one was just plain weird.  
  
  The fifth listing down read,  
  
  THREE ROOMMATES SEEKING FOURTH, huge old house, privacy assured, reasonable rent and utilities.  
  
  Which. . . okay, she wasn't sure that she could afford ""reasonable"" - she was more looking for ""dirt cheap"" - but at least it sounded less weird than the others. Three roommates. That meant three more people who'd maybe take up for her if Monica and company came sniffing around. . . or at least take up for the house. Hmmmmm.  
  
  She called, and got an answering machine with a mellow-sounding, young-sounding male voice.  
  
  ""Hello, you've reached the Glass House. If you're looking for Michael, he sleeps days. If you're looking for Shane, good luck with that, 'cause we never know where the hell he is"" - distant laughter from at least two people - ""and if you're looking for Eve, you'll probably get her on her cell phone or at the shop. But hey. Leave a message. And if you're looking to audition for the room, come on by. It's 716  
  
  West Lot Street. "" A totally different voice, a female one lightened up by giggles like bubbles in soda, said, ""Yeah, just look for the mansion. "" And then a third voice, male again. ""Gone with the Wind meets The Munsters. "" More laughter, and a beep.  
  
  Claire blinked, coughed, and finally said, ""Um. . . hi. My name is Claire? Claire Danvers? And I was, um, calling about the, um, room thing. Sorry. "" And hung up in a panic. Those three people sounded. . . normal.  
  
  But they sounded pretty close, too. And in her experience, groups of friends like that just didn't open up to include underage, undersized geeks like her. They hadn't sounded mean; they just sounded - self-confident. Something she wasn't.  
  
  She checked the rest of the listings, and felt her heart actually sink a little. Maybe an inch and a half, with a slight sideways twist. God, I'm dead. She couldn't sleep out here on a bench like some homeless loser, and she couldn't go back to the dorm; she had to do something.  
  
  Fine, she thought, and snapped her phone shut, then open again to dial a cab.  
  
  Seven sixteen Lot Street. Gone with the Wind meets The Munsters. Right.  
  
  Maybe they'd at least feel sorry enough for her to put her up for one lousy night.  
  
  The cabbie - she figured he was just about the only cabdriver in Morganville, which apart from the campus at TPU on the edge of town had only about ten thousand people in it - took an hour to show up.  
  
  Claire hadn't been in a car in six weeks, since her parents had driven her into town. She hadn't been much beyond a block of the campus, either, and then just to buy used books for class.  
  
  ""You meeting someone?"" the cabbie asked. She was staring out the window at the storefronts: used-clothing shops, used-book shops, computer stores, stores that sold nothing but wooden Greek letters. All catering to the college.  
  
  ""No,"" she said. ""Why?""  
  
  The cabbie shrugged. ""Usually you kids are meeting up with friends. If you're looking for a good time - ""  
  
  She shivered. ""I'm not. I'm - yes, I'm meeting some people. If you could hurry, please. . . ?""  
  
  He grunted and took a right turn, and the cab went from Collegetown to Creepytown in one block flat.  
  
  She couldn't define how it happened exactly - the buildings were pretty much the same, but they looked dim and old, and the few people moving on the streets had their heads down and were walking fast. Even when people were walking in twos or threes, they weren't chatting. When the cab passed, people looked up, then down again, as if they'd been looking for another kind of car.  
  
  A little girl was walking with her hand in her mother's, and as the cab stopped for a light, the girl waved, just a little. Claire waved back.  
  
  The girl's mother looked up, alarmed, and hustled her kid away into the black mouth of a store that sold used electronics. Wow, Claire thought. Do I look that scary? Maybe she did. Or maybe Morganville was just ultracareful of its kids.  
  
  Funny, now that she thought about it, there was something missing in this town. Signs. She'd seen them all her life stapled to telephone poles. . . advertisements for lost dogs, missing kids or adults.  
  
  Nothing here. Nothing.  
  
  ""Lot Street,"" the cabbie announced, and squealed to a stop. ""Ten fifty. ""  
  
  For a five-minute ride? Claire thought, amazed, but she paid up. She thought about shooting him the finger as he drove away, but he looked kind of dangerous, and besides, she really wasn't the kind of girl who did that sort of thing. Usually. It was a bad day, though.  
  
  She hoisted her backpack again, hit a bruise on her shoulder, and nearly dropped the weight on her foot.  
  
  Tears stung at her eyes. All of a sudden she felt tired and shaky again, scared. . . . At least on campus she'd kind of been on relatively familiar ground, but out here in town it was like being a stranger, all over again.  
  
  Morganville was brown. Burned brown by the sun, beaten down by wind and weather. Hot summer was starting to give way to hot autumn, and the leaves on the trees - what trees there were - looked gray-edged and dry, and they rattled like paper in the wind. West Lot Street was near what passed for the downtown district in town, probably an old residential neighborhood. Nothing special about the homes that she could see. . . ranch houses, mos  
t of them with peeling, faded paint.  
  
  She counted house numbers, and realized she was standing in front of 716. She turned and looked behind her, and gasped, because whoever the guy had been on the phone, he'd been dead-on right in his description. Seven sixteen looked like a movie set, something straight out of the Civil War. Big graying columns. A wide front porch. Two stories of windows.  
  
  The place was huge. Well, not huge - but bigger than Claire had imagined. Like, big enough to be a frat house, and probably perfectly suited to it. She could just imagine Greek letters over the door.  
  
  It looked deserted, but to be fair every house on the block looked deserted. Late afternoon, nobody home from work yet. A few cars glittered in the white-hot sunshine, finish softened by a layer of dirt. No cars in front of 716, though.  
  
  This was such a bad idea, she thought, and there were those tears again, bubbling up along with panic.  
  
  What was she going to do? Walk up to the door and beg to be a roommate? How lame-ass was that?  
  
  They'd think she was pathetic at best, a head case at worst. No, it had been a dumb idea to even blow the money on cab fare.  
  
  It was hot, and she was tired and she hurt and she had homework due, and no place to sleep, and all of a sudden, it was just too much.  
  
  Claire dropped her backpack, buried her bruised face in both hands, and just started sobbing like a baby. Crybaby freak, she imagined Monica saying, but that just made her sob harder, and all of a sudden the idea of going home, going home to Mom and Dad and the room she knew they'd kept open for her, seemed better, better than anything out here in the scary, crazy world. . . .  
  
  ""Hey,"" a girl's voice said, and someone touched her on the elbow. ""Hey, are you okay?""  
  
  Claire yelped and jumped, landed hard on her strained ankle, and nearly toppled over. The girl who'd scared her reached out and grabbed her arm to steady her, looking genuinely scared herself. ""I'm sorry!  
  
  God, I'm such a klutz. Look, are you okay?""  
  
  The girl wasn't Monica, or Jen, or Gina, or anybody else she'd seen around the campus at TPU; this girl was way Goth. Not in a bad way - she didn't have the sulky I'm-so-not-cool-I'm-cool attitude of most of the Goths Claire had known in school - but the dyed-black, shag-cut hair, the pale makeup, the heavy eyeliner and mascara, the red-and-black-striped tights and clunky black shoes and black pleated miniskirt. . . very definitely a fan of the dark side.  
  
  ""My name's Eve,"" the girl said, and smiled. It was a sweet, funny kind of smile, something that invited Claire to share in a private joke. ""Yeah, my parents really named me that, go figure. It's like they knew how I'd turn out. "" Her smile faded, and she took a good look at Claire's face. ""Wow. Jeez, nice black eye. Who hit you?""  
  
  ""Nobody. "" Claire said it instantly, without even thinking why, although she knew in her bones that Goth Eve was in no way bestest friends with preppy Monica. ""I had an accident. ""  
  
  ""Yeah,"" Eve agreed softly. ""I used to have those kinds of accidents, falling into fists and stuff. Like I said, I'm a klutz. You okay? You need a doctor or something? I can drive you if you want. ""  
  
  She gestured to the street next to them, and Claire realized that while she'd been sobbing her eyes out, an ancient beater of a black Cadillac - complete with tail fins - had been docked at the curb. There was a cheery-looking skull dangling from the rearview mirror, and Claire had no doubt that the back bumper would be plastered with stickers for emo bands nobody had ever heard of.  
  
  She liked Eve already. ""No,"" she said, and swiped at her eyes angrily with the back of her hand. ""I, uh - look, I'm sorry. It's been a really awful day. I was coming to ask about the room, but - ""  
  
  ""Right, the room!"" Eve snapped her fingers, as if she'd forgotten all about it, and jumped up and down two or three times in excitement. ""Great! I'm just home for break - I work over at Common Grounds, you know, the coffee shop? - and Michael won't be up for a while yet, but you can come in and see the house if you want. I don't know if Shane's around, but - ""  
  
  ""I don't know if I should - ""  
  
  ""You should. You totally should. "" Eve rolled her eyes. ""You wouldn't believe the losers we see trying to get in the door. I mean, seriously. Freaks. You're the first normal one I've seen so far. Michael would kick my ass if I let you get away without at least trying a sales pitch. ""  
  
  Claire blinked. Somehow, she'd been thinking that she'd be the one begging for them to consider her. . . and normal? Eve thought she was normal?  
  
  ""Sure,"" she heard herself say. ""Yeah. I'd like that. ""  
  
  Eve grabbed her backpack and slung it over her own shoulder, on top of her black silver-studded purse in the shape of a coffin. ""Follow me. "" And she bounced away, up the walk to the gracious Southern Gothic front porch to unlock the door.  
  
  Up close, the house looked old, but not really rundown as such; weathered, Claire decided. Could have used some paint here and there, and the cast-iron chairs needed a coat, too. The front door was actually double-sized, with a big stained-glass panel at the top.  
  
  ""Yo!"" Eve yelled, and dumped Claire's backpack on a table in the hallway, her purse next to it, her keys in an antique-looking ashtray with a cast-iron monkey on the handle. ""Roomies! We've got a live one!""  
  
  It occurred to Claire, as the door boomed shut behind her, that there were a couple of ways to interpret that, and one of them - the Texas Chainsaw Massacre way - wasn't good. She stopped moving, frozen, and just looked around.  
  
  Nothing overtly creepy about the inside of the house, at least. Lots of wood, clean and simple. Chips of paint knocked off of corners, like it had seen a lot of life. It smelled like lemon polish and - chili?  
  
  ""Yo!"" Eve yelled again, and clumped on down the hall. It opened up to a bigger room; from what Claire could see, there were big leather couches and bookshelves, like a real home. Maybe this was what off-campus housing looked like. If so, it was a big step up from dorm life. ""Shane, I smell the chili. I know you're here! Get your headphones out of your ears!""  
  
  She couldn't quite imagine Texas Chainsaw Massacre taking place in a room like that, either. That was a plus. Or, for that matter, serial-killing roommates doing something as homey as making chili. Good chili, from the way it smelled. With. . . garlic?  
  
  She took a couple of hesitant steps down the hallway. Eve's footsteps were clunking off into another room, maybe the kitchen. The house seemed very quiet. Nothing jumped out to scare her, so Claire proceeded, one careful foot after another, all the way into the big central room.  
  
  And a guy lying sprawled on the couch - the way only guys could sprawl - yawned and sat up rubbing his head. When Claire opened her mouth - whether to say hello or to yell for help, she didn't know - he surprised her into silence by grinning at her and putting his finger over his mouth to shush her. ""Hey,"" he whispered. ""I'm Shane. What's up?"" He blinked a couple of times, and without any change in his expression, said, ""Dude, that is a badass shiner. Hurts, huh?""  
  
  She nodded slightly. Shane swung his legs off the couch and sat there, watching her, elbows on his knees and hands dangling loosely. He had brown hair, cut in uneven layers that didn't quite manage to look punk. He was an older boy, older than her, anyway. Eighteen? A big guy, and tall to match it. Big enough to make her feel more miniature than usual. She thought his eyes looked brown, but she didn't dare meet them for more than a flicker at a time.  
  
  ""So I guess you're gonna say that the other chick looks worse,"" Shane said.  
  
  She shook her head, then winced when motion made it hurt even more. ""No, I - um - how did you know it was - ?""  
  
  ""A chick? Easy. Size you are, a guy would have put you in the hospital with a punch hard enough to leave a mark like that. So what's up with that? You don't look like you go looking for trouble. ""  
  
  She felt like she ought to take offense about that, but honestly, this whole thing was starting to feel like some strange dream anyway. Maybe she'd never woken up at all. Maybe she was lying in a coma in a hospital bed, and Shane was just her lame-ass equivalent of the Cheshire  
cat. ""I'm Claire,"" she said, and waved awkwardly. ""Hi. ""  
  
  He nodded toward a leather wing chair. She slid into it, feet dangling, and felt a weird sense of relief wash over her. It felt like home, although of course it wasn't, and she was starting to think that it really couldn't be. She didn't fit here. She couldn't actually imagine who would.  
  
  ""You want something?"" Shane asked suddenly. ""Coke, maybe? Chili? Bus ticket back home?""  
  
  ""Coke,"" she said, and, surprisingly, ""and chili. ""  
  
  ""Good choice. I made it myself. "" He slid off the couch, weirdly boneless for his size, and padded barefoot into the kitchen where Eve had gone. Claire listened to a blur of voices as the two of them talked, and relaxed, one muscle at a time, into the soft embrace of the chair. She hadn't noticed until now, but the house was kept cool, and the lazy circle of the ceiling fan overhead swept chilly air over her hot, aching face. It felt nice.  
  
  She opened her eyes at the sound of Eve's shoes clomping back into the room. Eve was carrying a tray with a red and white can, a bowl, a spoon, and an ice pack. She set the tray on a coffee table and nudged the table toward Claire with her knee. ""Ice pack first,"" she said. ""You can never tell what Shane puts in the chili. Be afraid. ""  
  
  Shane padded back to the couch and flopped, sucking on his own can of soda. Eve shot him an exasperated look. ""Yeah, man, thanks for bringing me one, too. "" The raccoon eye makeup exaggerated her eye roll. ""Dork. ""  
  
  ""Didn't know if you wanted zombie dirt sprinkled on it or anything. If you're eating this week. ""  
  
  ""Dork! Go on and eat, Claire - I'll go get my own. ""  
  
  Claire picked up the spoon and tried a tentative bite of the chili, which was thick and meaty and spicy, heavy on the garlic. Delicious, in fact. She'd gotten used to cafeteria food, and this was just. . . wow. Not.  
  
  Shane watched her, eyebrows up, as she started to shovel it in. ""'Sgood,"" she mumbled. He gave her a lazy salute. By the time she was halfway through the bowl, Eve was back with her own tray, which she plunked down on the other half of the coffee table. Eve sat on the floor, crossed her legs, and dug in.  
  
  ""Not bad,"" she finally said. ""At least you left out the oh-my-God sauce this time. ""  
  
  ""Made myself a batch with it,"" Shane said. ""It's got the biohazard sticker on it in the fridge, so don't bitch if you get flamed. Where'd you pick up the stray?""  
  
  ""Outside. She came to see the room. ""  
  
  ""You beat her up first, just to make sure she's tough enough?""  
  
  ""Bite me, chili boy. ""  
  
  ""Don't mind Eve,"" he told Claire. ""She hates working days. She's afraid she'll tan. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, and Shane just hates working. So what's your name?""  
  
  Claire opened her mouth, but Shane beat her to it, clearly happy to one-up his roomie. ""Claire. What, you didn't even ask? A chick beat her up, too. Probably some skank in the dorms. You know how that place is. ""  
  
  They exchanged a look. A long one. Eve turned back to Claire. ""Is that true? You got beat up in the dorm?"" She nodded, hastily shoveling more food in her mouth to keep from having to say much. ""Well, that totally blows. No wonder you're looking for the room. "" Another nod. ""You didn't bring much with you. ""  
  
  ""I don't have much,"" she said. ""Just the books, and maybe a couple of things back at my room. But - I don't want to go back there to get stuff. Not tonight. ""  
  
  ""Why not?"" Shane had grabbed a ratty-looking old baseball from the floor and tossed it up toward the tall ceiling, narrowly missing the spinning blades of the fan. He caught it without effort. ""Somebody still looking to pound you?""  
  
  ""Yeah,"" Claire said, and looked down into her fast-diminishing chili. ""Guess so. It's not just her, it's - she's got friends. And. . . I don't. That place just - well, it's creepy. ""  
  
  ""Been there,"" Eve said. ""Oh, wait, still there. ""  
  
  Shane mimed throwing the baseball at her. She mimed ducking.  
  
  ""What time is Michael getting up?""  
  
  Shane gave her another mock throw. ""Hell, Eve, I don't know. I love the guy, but I don't love the guy.  
  
  Go bang on his door and ask. Me, I'm gonna go get ready. ""  
  
  ""Ready for what?"" Eve asked. ""You're not seriously going out again, are you?""  
  
  ""Seriously, yeah. Bowling. Her name's Laura. If you want more details, you're gonna have to download the video like everybody else. "" Shane rolled off the couch, stood up, and padded off toward the wide stairs leading up to the second floor. ""See you later, Claire. ""  
  
  Eve made a frustrated sound. ""Wait a minute! So what do you say? You think she'd do okay here, or what?

Research results suggest I reset the SMC and NVRAM, both of which were unsuccessful. I also ran Apple Diagnostics that found no issues. This brings up some questions.

1. Both of those solutions require using keys on the keyboard (which isn't functioning). Should I use the external keyboard (Omoton) or the laptop keyboard to hit the Shift, Control, Option, Command, and P and R keys?

2. My Bluetooth conked out at the exact same time. It does not recognize any signals to pair with, even in a busy coffee shop. Is Bluetooth related to the keyboard/trackpad functionality in any way?

3. There is no damage to the unit and I take care of the machine very well. There are suggestions to open it up and search for grime/dust/filth/loose wires. If all the other options we can try do not work, is there a specific spot in the setup that is more likely to be the location of the cause?

Taking the computer apart is going to be difficult as I am homeless without a place to set up shop for a few hours. Please, if you have any wizardly or common sense insights into this strange set of problems I appreciate the help. What say you? Cheers!",1,1750177572.0,techsupport,0,1.0,False
1ldrmhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/1ldrmhg/edwin_and_the_remnant_machine/,Edwin and the Remnant Machine,"So this may be the biggest crackpot rant I’ve ever turned to, but I really think narratively it sounds cool, so I introduce you to:

Edwin’s Remnant Manor Theory

Throughout the secret of the mimic, we are directed by dispatch (or rather the mimic) to many power stations in the facility used to transfer power to different sections. 
We see a valve full of strange molten liquid that is then pushed through pipes. 

But why is molten magma used to power this place? 

Why are there giant pipes at the end in the underground facility pumping tons of this metal?

I think they already told us why.

We learn from the Dolly section that she “recycles” broken parts into vats that are then heated to molten metal, the same metal that runs through every room of the factory.

This molten metal is from recycled attractions, animatronics, and parts of machinery from failed/broken attractions. This is told to us by Dolly’s introduction.

This look and understanding of molten metal is very similar to remnant.

Now I’m not saying Edwin understood totally what he was doing, however, if you found a power source using scrapped parts, then you would absolutely use that to power your whole facility. Especially in how they refer to “going green”.

This could mean that after the mentioned disaster of Fall Fest (which we hear about Fiona’s death), the remnant could have bonded to the wreckage, spilled onto all of those scraps of machinery that didn’t totally burn. Same with any product that caused horrors to people. That coffee pot email where someone was hospitalized? They say in those emails they’re returning the product to the manufacturer. Into the furnace they go!

So for whatever Edwin burned in those pits, the heated remnant powers, like a battery, the whole factory.

I think it’s extremely interesting considering William now owning this facility and creating Sister Location. Think about the entrance shows elevator. Odd it seems familiar, a giant circular tunnel leading down level after level. This could show us how William found remnant. After stealing all of Murray’s inventions, who’s to say he doesn’t steal and experiment in the ultimate battery of a soul bound to steel.

There are some holes admittedly: doesn’t remnant get destroyed if totally burnt?
But we learn through multiple games that remnant can absolutely take significant amounts of heat, and when heated properly, it can be used in full capacity, like with the fun-times.

Let me know what you think!

The ""espresso"" that I make with it is basically just decent coffee, it has no crema and no flavor notes, but I would like to improve! I would appreciate any advice.

My current method is:

1. Turn on the machine and wait for the OK indicator (which turns on in about a minute)
2. Preheat the appliance and the cup by filling the cup with hot water from the appliance
3. Wait for the OK indicator (which turns on again in about a minute)
4. Put illy Classico E.S.E. Pods in the basket and run the machine (which takes a minute or 2)

Are these the right things to do to improve my method?

1. Use fresh coffee instead of E.S.E. Pods
2. Use a better basket such as a a la pavoni millennium double basket
3. Use a grinder like a baratza encore
4. Use a real tamper
5. When I preheat the appliance run the water through the basket to preheat it as well

1ldrkpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/chomsky/comments/1ldrkpy/what_happened_to_america/,What happened to America?,"People keep asking, “What happened to America?”
Did it stop standing for freedom and democracy?
It’s a real tragedy.
Because as everyone knows, America used to be the global supplier of freedom.

Just ask the Native Americans.
They were introduced to freedom through modern civilization, forced migration, and smallpox.
Then came slavery, to be fair, was a strong economic foundation.
So strong, in fact, that it eventually allowed America to afford abolition.
That’s called long-term planning.

In the Philippines, freedom was imported straight from Spain via American intervention.
And then held in a storage unit for a few decades,
just to make sure the locals didn't mess it up.

America helped end World War II by introducing nuclear liberty to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Quick, efficient, unmistakably democratic.

Later, in Latin America, freedom showed up wearing sunglasses and a CIA badge.
Democracy might’ve been elected,
but America knew what the region really needed:
military coups, death squads, and just enough capitalism to keep the coffee flowing.

Iran almost fell into socialism in 1953, but America saved the day,
by reinstalling a monarchy.
Because what screams ""people's freedom"" like a royal dictatorship?

Vietnam was another close call.
Millions died, but freedom almost made it.
A valiant effort.

Iraq?
Well, who wouldn’t want to be bombed into democracy?
Freedom came, saw, and destabilized.

And Libya,
Gaddafi was a brutal man, no doubt.
Luckily, freedom came again.
Today, Libya is a thriving hub of… open-air slave markets.
Progress.

America also helps maintain peace by selling weapons to nearly every region on fire.
Yemen, Israel, Saudi Arabia -
it’s all part of the grand strategy called “regional stability.”

At home, America defends liberty through mass incarceration, police militarization,
and choosing not to give people healthcare 
because true freedom means dying with options.

Global economic freedom?
That’s the IMF’s job.
Just lend poor nations money with strings attached,
cut public services, raise debt and boom.
Freedom via austerity.

And let’s not forget the great protector of liberty: Israel 
the Middle East’s only democracy*,
(*with caveats for occupation, checkpoints, walls, and stateless millions).
America ensures this beacon stays bright, with billions in annual aid,
advanced weapons, and ironclad veto power.

So when people say,
“America has changed. It doesn’t stand for freedom anymore,”
you have to wonder...

Did it change?
Or did we just stop believing the story?

Because the story never changed.
Only the mask got tired.

Now that the mask has slipped.
We have a choice:
Keep pretending -
or start rebuilding something real

I used to be the busiest unproductive person you'd ever meet.

Working 14-hour days but accomplishing what should take 4 hours.

Drowning in repetitive tasks that added no value to my business.

Frustrated, overwhelmed, and burning out fast.

Then I discovered AI browser automation.

Everything changed overnight.

Now I'm accomplishing more in 4 hours than I used to in 14.

My business is growing faster.

My stress levels are lower.

And I actually have time for life outside work.

# 🔥 The Productivity Crisis That AI Browser Automation Solved

Before AI browser automation, my days looked like this:

14 hours of work.

Most of it mindless, repetitive stuff.

But I thought this was normal.

I thought being ""busy"" meant being productive.

AI browser automation showed me how wrong I was.

1ldri1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1ldri1i/useless_facts/,Useless Facts,"To this day I still remember all of these things that used to be of so much value to me and now serve me no purpose. But I just can’t seem to forget them.


I can’t seem to forget that you started drinking coffee when you were eight because your older siblings drank it and you always wanted to be like them. I can’t seem to forget that you like your vanilla ice cream with strawberries and bananas and you think birthday cake ice cream sounds gross. I can’t seem to forget that you hate peanut butter but love chocolate peanut butter cups and you hate dark chocolate but eat milk chocolate by the handful.


I can’t seem to forget that you would plug your ears during every year’s Fourth of July fireworks because loud noises make you nervous. I can’t seem to forget that if you could go anywhere, you’d go to Paris and maybe never come back and yet you never learned how to speak French. I can’t seem to forget that you prefer swimming in lakes instead of pools and I can’t forget how much you loved painting your nails, so much so that the tips of your natural nails were tinted yellow from years of polish.


I can’t seem to forget the fairy lights that hung from the ceiling in your bedroom as we whispered secrets to each other under the covers. I can’t seem to forget eating an entire sleeve of Oreos with you as we watched movies until the break of dawn. I can’t seem to forget arguing over which boy our favorite book characters should have chosen and I can’t seem to forget that you always chose the wrong one.


No matter what, I just can’t seem to forget . . .

Anyway I like trying new things anyways and they were considerable cheap, so I grabbed them either way. Apparently they are a startup in the San Francisco area. I grabbed the barbecue energy chips and they were actually pretty good with this restaurant style barbecue tang. The caffeine worked too, I continued my work day without a single sip of coffee and I was able to be more productive than usual. Definitely give it a try, these could be big.
