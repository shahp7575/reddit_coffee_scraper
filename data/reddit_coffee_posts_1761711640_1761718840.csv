Imagine walking into your favorite coffee shop, and before you even place an order, the barista greets you by name and starts preparing your usual drink. Feels good, right? That’s personalization in action—a small touch that makes a big impact on customer engagement.

In today’s digital world, where consumers are bombarded with countless marketing messages, personalization is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. Businesses that master personalization build stronger relationships, enhance customer loyalty, and drive higher conversions. But how do you get it right? Let’s dive into the world of personalization and uncover how it can transform your customer engagement strategy.

**Why Personalization Matters**

Consumers today expect brands to know them. According to a study by McKinsey, 76% of consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that personalize their experiences. Personalization creates relevance, making customers feel valued rather than just another name on a mailing list. Here’s why it’s crucial:.........",1,1761718545.0,kanitysolutions,0,1.0,False

Jessa

Seven Years Earlier

Growing up as a twin sounds fun, right? Built-in best friend, someone who always has your back, someone who gets you without explanation. That’s what I had—at least for the first ten years of my life.

My twin brother, Jackson, was the center of my world. We were fraternal twins, but opposites in every way. Jackson was tall, lean, athletic, and could make friends with just about anyone. I was short, a little chunky, shy to the point of painful, and usually tripping over my own feet.

But it never mattered to me. I didn’t need a million friends. I had Jackson. He was my best friend, my other half, my person.

It was always just the two of us. Our mom worked constantly to keep food on the table, so most of the time it was just me and him. Maybe that’s why we clung to each other so hard.

“Jax, I wanna go home,” I whined, dragging my feet as he tossed a football from hand to hand.

“Jess, chill. I told the new kid I’d meet him here to throw the ball around,” he said, his brown eyes locked on the field like he was already in the NFL.

“This is boring.” I plopped down on the grass.

He sighed, dug in his pocket, and tossed me a granola bar. “Here. Peanut butter. Your favorite.”

Instant mood boost. “Yes! Thanks, Jax.”

While I was tearing open the wrapper, he straightened up, glancing at the entrance to the field. “That’s him.”

A boy about our age walked toward us, a football tucked under his arm. He had dark, messy brown hair and the greenest eyes I’d ever seen. The kind of eyes you notice right away. And his lashes? Long enough to make me jealous.

“Hey,” he said to Jackson.

“Hey, Noah. This is my twin, Jessa.”

I scrambled up, brushing grass off my jeans. My mouth moved faster than my brain. “Wow… you’ve got really long eyelashes. For a boy.”

Noah’s cheeks turned pink. “Uh, thanks?”

Jackson groaned. “Sorry, she doesn’t have a filter sometimes.”

“I just meant they’re… pretty,” I tried, wishing I could disappear.

“Jess, why don’t you go sit while we toss the ball around,” Jackson muttered.

“She doesn’t play?” Noah asked.

I shook my head before Jackson could answer. “Not really my thing.”

“Nope. If she tried to throw, she’d probably knock herself over,” Jackson joked.

I pretended not to care, sitting back down on the sidelines, but my eyes kept drifting toward Noah as he and Jackson tossed the ball. He wasn’t just cute—he was quiet, too. Almost shy. Something about him made me want him to like me.

After they finished, Jackson clapped him on the back. “You’ve got a good arm.”

“Two older brothers taught me some stuff,” Noah shrugged.

“Oh! So they’re your best friends too, like me and Jackson?” I asked eagerly.

“No. They’re just… brothers. I don’t really have a best friend.”

My heart squeezed. “Then you should get one. Me and Jackson do everything together. He’s the best best friend you could ever have.”

Noah looked at Jackson. Jackson just shrugged. Noah nodded slightly, like he got the message.

At the time, I didn’t realize how wrong I was.

One Month Later

“I don’t wanna go to the movies, Jax!” I whined, arms crossed.

“Too bad. Noah and I wanna see the new Marvel movie. You can’t stay home alone.”

“We always do what you and Noah want. What about me?”

He sighed. “Jess, I love you. But sometimes I wanna do stuff without you. You need to find your own friends.”

That stung more than I wanted to admit.

The doorbell rang, and Noah walked in with his usual smirk.

“Sup.”

“Jess, get your shoes on,” Jackson ordered.

“She’s coming too?” Noah asked.

“Yeah. Mom’s at work. I’m babysitting.”

“Babysitting?” I snapped. “We’re the same age! You’re not babysitting me.”

“I’m twelve minutes older,” Jackson shot back.

Noah snickered. “She’s definitely acting like the baby.”

I stormed off to grab my shoes, but I froze halfway up the stairs when I heard Noah’s voice:

“Man, your sister’s such a brat. Wish she didn’t have to tag along.”

Jackson’s answer was the knife that cut deepest. “Tell me about it.”

At the theater, I tried to forget. “Jax, can we get popcorn? With extra butter?”

Noah raised his brows. “Do you really need the extra butter?”

I clenched my fists. “Yes. I like it that way.”

Jackson slipped me a couple of bills. “Get your own small one.”

I headed for the snack line, and that’s when I heard them again.

“She always has to be eating,” Noah muttered.

“Yeah,” Jackson said with a low laugh. “Sometimes it’s embarrassing to be seen with her.”

The words hit harder than any punch. My own twin—my best friend—was embarrassed of me.

“Hey, it’s your turn,” a girl behind me said gently.

I shook my head. “Changed my mind.”

She frowned. “You okay?”

“No,” I whispered. “I think I lost my best friend.”

She studied me, then said, “I’m Mariah. We’re in the same class, right? You’re Jessa. Jackson’s twin.”

“Yeah.”

“What movie are you supposed to be seeing?”

“Some superhero thing.”

Mariah smirked. “Ditch it. Come with me instead. There’s a new comedy. Way cuter lead actor.”

Before I could decide, Jackson and Noah appeared.

“Jess, what’s taking so long?” Jackson demanded. “Oh, hey, Mariah.”

Mariah smiled sweetly. “Hi. Jessa and I are seeing the comedy instead.”

Jackson shrugged. “Fine. Meet us in the lobby after.”

As he and Noah disappeared, Mariah tugged me toward her theater.

“Come on. You need a laugh.”

I glanced back one last time at my brother’s retreating figure.

He stole my best friend, I thought. And he’s never giving him back.

Three Years Later

Thirteen hit me hard. My body changed in ways I didn’t ask for. I wasn’t the chubby little girl anymore—I had curves. Breasts too big for my age. Hips that didn’t match the other girls at school.

Mom always said, Girls built like us need to cover up. Layers make you look thinner.

So I wore baggy shirts. Oversized hoodies. Clothes that swallowed me whole. It didn’t matter. The teasing still came.

“Jess, you’re wearing that?” Jackson asked one morning, eyeing my loose shirt.

“It’s comfortable.”

“It’s a tent.” He rolled his eyes and left.

Mom kissed my cheek. “Ignore him. He doesn’t understand what it’s like for girls like us.”

At school, the comments started before I even reached the doors.

“The circus is in town!”

“Yeah, they brought the whale exhibit!”

My stomach dropped when I saw where it came from—Jackson and Noah, flanked by their football buddies, all laughing.

“Nice shirt, Jess,” Noah snorted. “They only had tent size left?”

“Shut up, Noah.”

Jackson smirked. “Told you it was too big.”

“Perfect for hiding that fat ass,” Noah added, sending the group into hysterics.

I turned away, pretending I couldn’t hear. But their laughter followed me.

By the time I reached my locker, my hands were shaking. I tugged the handle, but it was jammed. Mariah appeared at my side.

“Need help?”

We pulled together until it finally burst open—and trash bags tumbled out, spilling all over the hallway.

A note taped to one read: Got you a new wardrobe.

The roar of laughter around us was deafening.

“Did you do this?” Mariah snapped at Jackson and Noah, who had pushed through the crowd to watch.

Noah grinned. “She wants to dress like a hobo? Why not just give her options?”

Jackson chuckled. “Relax. It’s just a joke.”

Mariah glared at him. “She’s your sister.”

But Jackson only walked away with Noah.

I stared at the trash bag in my hands. For just one second, I wished I could trade places. To be the one laughing, not the one humiliated.

Present Day

Beep. Beep. Beep.

I groaned, slamming my alarm clock. Senior year. My last year in this hellhole.

I’m Jessa. Nobody special. Just the overweight twin sister of Jackson, starting quarterback and golden boy of our high school. The sister his best friend, Noah Carter, has made it his life’s mission to torment.

Once, when I was ten, I thought Noah was cute. That crush didn’t survive the year. Now at eighteen, he’s tall, broad-shouldered, perfect hair, perfect smile. Every girl wants him.

And I can’t stand him.

But he’s always around—because he’s Jackson’s best friend. The boy who stole my brother from me.

I roll out of bed and tug on my armor: jeans, tank top, oversized button-up. The layers hide the body I’ve been told to be ashamed of.

Time to sneak out before Jackson sees me. Before Noah’s voice finds me.

Another day. Another battle.

Chapter 2

Jessa

I tiptoe down the hallway, holding my breath. If Jackson’s awake, he’ll have some comment locked and loaded about my clothes, my hair, or just… me. I’d rather start the day without it.

Too late. His bedroom door creaks open, and there he is—my twin, my other half, my betrayer—all six feet of cocky quarterback standing in my way.

“Morning, Jess,” he says, eyes flicking over my shirt. “Nice… tent.”

I don’t even answer. I just shoulder past him, my cheeks heating.

“Aw, come on, don’t be so sensitive,” he calls after me.

Sensitive. That’s what he calls me when his words cut deep, like it’s my fault for feeling anything.

By the time I make it to the kitchen, Mom’s already gone. She leaves early most mornings, and I can’t decide if I’m grateful or jealous. Grateful that she doesn’t see me like this, jealous that she never has time for us.

Jackson grabs a protein shake from the fridge and downs it like he’s in some athlete commercial. I butter a piece of toast, trying to look invisible.

And then, of course, the devil himself arrives.

Noah Carter.

He strolls right into our kitchen like he owns it, helmet tucked under his arm, hair still damp from his shower, all six-foot-two of golden-boy arrogance. He’s wearing his jersey, number 14, stretched across broad shoulders like it was custom made for him.

And because I’m apparently a glutton for punishment, my stupid brain notices the curve of his jaw, the way his damp hair curls at the edges, the clean soap-and-sweat smell that clings to him. I hate myself for noticing.

“Morning, sunshine,” he smirks at me.

I roll my eyes. “Don’t call me that.”

“What? Thought you’d like a nickname.” His grin widens, like he knows exactly how to get under my skin.

Jackson laughs and bumps fists with him. “Ignore her, bro. Ready for practice?”

“Always,” Noah says. He glances at my toast, eyebrows lifting. “Extra butter again?”

I slam the knife down. “Seriously? Do you ever get tired of commenting on what I eat?”

Jackson snorts. “Don’t mind him, Jess.”

But I mind. God, I mind so much.

The two of them head out to the truck, leaving me with a cold piece of toast and the familiar ache in my chest. It’s the same ache I’ve had since I was ten years old.

The ache of realizing my twin—my best friend—chose someone else.

At school, it doesn’t get better. It never does.

The minute I step into the hallway, eyes flick my way. Whispers. Snickers. The same crap I’ve been hearing since middle school.

“Damn, she’s bigger than the linebackers.”

“Bet she eats more than the team.”

I keep walking, head down, pretending the words don’t stab me. But they do. Every single one leaves another scar I can’t cover with oversized clothes.

Jackson doesn’t notice, or maybe he does and just doesn’t care. He’s too busy soaking in the glory of being the starting quarterback. Too busy laughing with Noah and the rest of the team.

Noah. Always Noah.

The worst part is that when he laughs, it’s this deep, warm sound that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When he smiles, girls melt into puddles. And when his hazel eyes catch the light, they almost glow.

I hate that I’ve noticed all of that.

I hate that part of me gets why the entire female population of Crestwood High would kill for a chance with him.

I hate that part of me, some twisted little part buried deep down, remembers what it felt like to have a crush on him before he turned into my tormentor.

Mariah finds me by my locker. Thank God for her. She’s the one good thing that came out of all this—the girl who saw me breaking at the movies three years ago and decided not to let me stand alone.

“You look like you’re ready to murder someone,” she says, tucking a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear.

“Noah,” I mutter. “As usual.”

She makes a face. “Ugh. You’d think after all these years he’d get bored.”

“He doesn’t. It’s like tormenting me is his favorite sport, right after football.”

Mariah sighs. “Well, senior year, right? Almost done.”

Almost. But almost feels like forever.

Lunch is the worst. Always has been.

I sit with Mariah at the edge of the cafeteria, away from the football table. But no matter how far away I am, Noah still finds me with his eyes. I feel them, sharp as daggers, hot as a spotlight.

Today’s no different. I’m halfway through my sandwich when I hear him across the room.

“Hey, Jackson! Better hide your food or Jess will eat it all before you blink.”

Laughter erupts from the table. Jackson doesn’t defend me. He never does.

I keep my head down, cheeks burning, praying no one else joins in. But of course they do.

“She could be the team mascot,” someone says. “Put her in pads, she’ll bulldoze the defense!”

The guys howl with laughter.

Mariah leans across the table, her eyes flashing. “Ignore them. They’re idiots.”

But ignoring doesn’t make it stop.

I grip my sandwich so tightly my knuckles turn white. In my head, I imagine standing up, marching over there, and telling Noah exactly what he is—a bully. A coward. A pathetic jerk who gets off on tearing me down.

But I don’t move.

Because I know what would happen if I did. He’d smirk. He’d say something sharper. And Jackson would laugh right alongside him.

Just like always.

That night, lying in bed, I stare at the ceiling.

This is my last year. One more year of Noah Carter. One more year of Jackson pretending I don’t exist except when it’s convenient. One more year of being “the fat twin,” the joke, the nobody.

After graduation, I’ll be free. College will be my reset button. Nobody will know me as Jackson’s sister or Noah’s favorite target. Nobody will remember the locker full of trash bags or the jokes about butter.

It’ll just be me.

But even as I tell myself that, my brain betrays me. Because it’s not Noah’s insults that replay behind my eyes. It’s his face. His stupidly perfect, sharp-jawed, broad-shouldered, movie-star face.

And I hate myself for it.

The next morning, the cycle repeats. Jackson teasing, Mom absent, me shrinking into myself.

But when Noah shows up, there’s a shift. Not big, not obvious—just a flicker.

He catches me staring.

I don’t mean to. Honest. I’m just zoning out, and my gaze lands on him, on the way his T-shirt stretches across his chest, on the strong line of his throat as he tilts his head back to laugh at something Jackson says.

And then his hazel eyes lock on mine.

For a second, I can’t breathe.

There’s no smirk, no insult, no sharp edge. Just Noah looking at me like… like he sees me.

Then he blinks, and it’s gone. Replaced by the same cocky grin I know too well.

“Like what you see, Sunshine?”

My face burns. “In your dreams.”

But that flicker stays with me all day.

And it terrifies me more than all his insults combined. Because what if—just what if—the boy who’s made my life hell for years is the one I can’t stop noticing?

What if the one I hate most is the one I’m secretly drawn to? And what if he knows it?

Chapter 3

Noah

Most people think I’ve got it easy.

They see the jersey, the captain’s armband, the girls who slide notes into my locker, the teachers who cut me slack because I’m “leading the team this season.” They see the highlight reels, the touchdowns, the swagger.

And yeah, I play into it. Why wouldn’t I? That image has kept me on top since freshman year.

But what they don’t see—the part I’d never admit out loud—is that the best part of my day isn’t the touchdowns. It’s not the cheers, or even the wins.

It’s Jessa Lombardi’s face when I get under her skin.

I shouldn’t find it that entertaining. She’s Jackson’s twin, for one. Which means technically, she’s off-limits. But God, she makes it too easy. The way her cheeks flush, the way she slams things down or throws out these sharp little comebacks—Jessa’s like one giant exposed nerve. Sensitive as hell.

And I like testing how far I can push before she snaps.

Take this morning, for example.

Jackson and I were heading to practice, but I swung by his place first. Walking into their kitchen always feels… weird. I don’t know why. Maybe because I can practically feel how much Jessa doesn’t want me there.

She was standing at the counter, spreading butter on toast like it had personally offended her. Oversized T-shirt, messy hair, bare feet curling against the tile. For a second, I almost didn’t say anything.

Almost.

“Morning, sunshine,” I tossed out, leaning in the doorway.

The way her shoulders stiffened—it was instant gratification. Like watching a fire catch.

“Don’t call me that,” she muttered, eyes on her plate.

“What? Thought you’d like a nickname.”

She rolled her eyes so hard I swear I heard them click.

Jackson laughed, completely oblivious. “Ignore her, bro.”

I didn’t ignore her, of course. Couldn’t. I never do. Instead, I spotted the toast and couldn’t resist. “Extra butter again?”

She slammed the knife down like she wanted to stab me with it.

“Seriously? Do you ever get tired of commenting on what I eat?”

And just like that, my day was made. That flare of anger in her eyes, the way her voice cracked on ever. She didn’t realize it, but she was giving me exactly what I wanted.

Attention.

Here’s the thing: Jessa doesn’t understand me. She thinks I pick on her just to be a jerk, or because I’ve got nothing better to do. But the truth? It’s not that simple.

I notice her.

More than I should.

And noticing her—really noticing her—is dangerous.

Because Jessa’s not like the other girls who throw themselves at me. She doesn’t giggle when I walk by or bat her lashes hoping I’ll toss her a grin. She doesn’t want anything from me.

Except maybe for me to disappear.

And that makes me want to poke, prod, irritate. It makes me want her to look at me, even if it’s with fire in her eyes. Because when she’s angry at me, at least she’s seeing me.

At school, it’s even better.

In the cafeteria, Jackson and I had the whole team cracking up over stupid inside jokes when I spotted her sitting with Mariah. Always the far table, always head down, like she’s hoping to disappear.

But I don’t let her disappear.

“Hey, Jackson!” I yelled across the room. “Better hide your food or Jess will eat it all before you blink.”

The table erupted. Perfect.

I caught the way her shoulders hunched, the way her hand froze halfway to her mouth. She didn’t look up, but I knew she heard me. Knew she felt the sting.

And yeah, maybe that makes me an asshole. But there’s something about her silence that gets to me. Like she’s holding all this emotion inside, and I’m the only one who knows how to drag it out of her.

Jackson doesn’t get it. To him, Jessa’s just… Jessa. His twin, his shadow, the sister he doesn’t think twice about. He doesn’t notice the way she winces when people whisper, or the way she pulls her hoodie tighter like armor.

But I do.

I see it.

And sometimes I wonder if that’s why I keep poking—because if I don’t, maybe no one would notice her at all.

Practice that afternoon should’ve wiped Jessa from my brain. It usually does. Once I’m on the field, nothing else matters. The snap of the ball, the crunch of pads, the roar of the guys—it drowns everything out.

But not today.

Today, when I closed my eyes, all I saw was the way she glared at me over her toast, cheeks flushed, eyes flashing.

And then—God help me—the way her gaze flickered over me. She thought she was subtle, but I caught it. The way her eyes lingered on my shoulders, my chest.

She thinks I don’t notice, but I do.

And that thought sticks with me longer than I’d like.

That night, lying in bed, I try to tell myself it’s nothing. Jessa’s sensitive, that’s all. She reacts to me because I push her buttons. If she didn’t, I’d probably lose interest.

Except… I’m not losing interest.

If anything, I’m hooked.

I want to know how far I can push before she finally snaps. Before she lets me see the fire I know she’s hiding.

I want to know if that fire burns as hot when it’s not anger.

The next morning, I catch her staring again.

She doesn’t realize it—I’m laughing at something Jackson said, tilting my head back, and when I glance over, her eyes are on me. Not in hate. Not in anger. Just… watching.

And for one insane second, it feels like she sees me. Not the quarterback. Not Jackson’s best friend. Not the jerk who won’t leave her alone.

Just me.

Our eyes lock, and the air shifts. She looks caught, like a deer in headlights.

For once, I don’t smirk. For once, I just look back.

But then panic kicks in, and I cover it with a grin. “Like what you see, Sunshine?”

Her face flames. “In your dreams.”

But I heard the hitch in her breath. I saw the way she couldn’t look away fast enough.

And that’s when I know I’m in trouble.

Because tormenting Jessa Lombardi isn’t just a game anymore.

It’s an addiction.

And sooner or later, it’s going to blow up in my face.

Chapter 4

Noah

The problem with lying to yourself is that eventually, the truth claws its way out.

I’ve been telling myself for years that I bug Jessa because it’s easy. Because she’s reactive, and I like the way she gets flustered. That’s it. Simple.

But it’s not.

If I’m honest—and I almost never am, even in my own head—it started way before she became “sensitive Jessa.”

It started in middle school.

Back then, Jessa was different. Not unrecognizable—she still had the dark eyes, the messy hair, the sharp tongue—but she laughed more. She’d shoot water through her teeth at Jackson during lunch, or race us to the corner store after practice and somehow always win, even though her legs were half the size of ours.

She wasn’t invisible back then. She didn’t try to be.

I noticed her before I even realized I was noticing her. The way her grin curved higher on the right side. The way she’d wrinkle her nose when she concentrated. The way she never backed down, even when she should have.

I liked it.

Too much.

And that scared the hell out of me.

Because she was Jackson’s twin. And Jackson’s my guy—my quarterback, my brother from another mother. There’s an unspoken rule: sisters are off-limits. Period.

So instead of admitting I was drawn to her, I started pushing her away. Teasing, needling, whatever you want to call it. It was easier to play the jerk than to let anyone—including her—guess how I actually felt.

And over the years, that mask stuck.

Now everyone, including Jessa, believes I really am that guy. The one who points out her extra butter, or makes cracks in the cafeteria.

But underneath it? Every time I say something, every time I watch her react, there’s this other layer.

I’m watching her mouth.

I’m watching her eyes.

I’m thinking things I shouldn’t think.

Last week was the worst.

We were at Jackson’s, sprawled on the couch, watching film. Jessa came in with a bowl of popcorn, pretending she didn’t care if we ate it all. She sat on the floor, leaning against the coffee table, hoodie sleeves covering her hands.

And when she laughed—actually laughed at some dumb commentary on TV—it hit me like a helmet to the ribs.

I hadn’t heard that laugh in a long time.

It wasn’t sharp or defensive. It wasn’t trying to hide. It was just… real.

I couldn’t stop staring.

And then she glanced up, caught me looking, and everything inside me knotted tight. Because for a second, I swear she knew.

Knew that I’d been watching her.

Knew that maybe, underneath all the teasing, I wanted her.

The worst part?

I don’t want to stop.

I tell myself I should. That she deserves better than being some secret I bury under sarcasm. That Jackson would kill me if he knew.

But then she glares at me across the table, or snaps back with some fiery retort, and it’s like gasoline on a match. I can’t quit.

It’s like the closer I get to the edge, the more I want to see what happens if I jump.

What happens if I stop hiding behind jokes and just say it.

That I like the way she looks in oversized T-shirts. That I notice how she tucks her hair behind her ear when she’s nervous. That I’ve thought about what her mouth would feel like against mine more times than I can admit.

That the reason I agitate her isn’t because she’s sensitive.

It’s because she makes me feel exposed.

And the only way I know how to handle it is to make her feel the same.

Lying here now, staring at the ceiling in the dark, I know I’m screwed.

Because sooner or later, I won’t be able to keep pretending.

And when that happens, everything—my friendship with Jackson, the team, the fragile balance we’ve all built—could go up in flames.

But the truth?

If it means Jessa finally sees me the way I see her…

Managing coworking spaces through WooCommerce shouldn’t feel like juggling calendars, emails, and payments all at once. But if you're using standard WooCommerce, your desks and rooms are treated like regular products no real-time availability, no time slots, and no way to prevent [double bookings](https://www.pluginhive.com/avoid-double-bookings-on-woocommerce/). As your business grows, this manual workflow becomes frustrating and limits your revenue.

That’s where automation comes in. With the [WooCommerce Booking and Appointments plugin](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-booking-and-appointments/), you can turn your website into a fully automated booking system where customers can check availability, book hourly or daily slots, add services like projectors or coffee, and pay instantly or with deposits, all without your manual involvement.

**Common Challenges When Renting Coworking Spaces Online**

* **Double bookings** lead to customer frustration and cancellations
* **No control over booking durations** like [hourly](https://www.pluginhive.com/woocommerce-bookings-for-hourly-services/), full-day, or monthly rentals
* **Manual payment follow-ups,** especially when accepting [deposits](https://www.pluginhive.com/woocommerce-deposits-automatic-payment-reminders/)
* **Too much back-and-forth communication** for confirmations, changes, or add-ons
* **Difficulty managing multiple resources** like desks, meeting rooms, and private offices

1oiwv5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1oiwv5o/the_light_of_the_graveyard_bells/,The light of the graveyard bells,"My name is Ben, and in case something happens, I need to write down what I saw, or at least think I saw. Whether you believe me or not is up to you. I know what I am about to describe might sound crazy; I would have said it was impossible just a while ago.

I know I should have just walked away when I saw the red flags. I should have listened to my gut. Sometimes, a job is not worth it, regardless of the pay. Now I fear whatever I saw last night could be looking for me this very moment. I should have left the first time I heard the bells.

It started two weeks ago. I had lost my job and was looking for work. It had already been two months at that point since the factory closed and for the first time in years, I was unemployed.

When I was looking for places that were hiring online, I noticed I had received a strange email. It was a work advertisement.

“Now hiring, security personnel for night shift at Aurora Ridge Cemetery. Call for more details, no previous security experience required.”

I was glad to see a potential job prospect had come to me. I never thought to look for security jobs, and definitely not at a place like a cemetery. I decided to call the number listed. The line rang for a minute until someone answered. It was a man with an odd inflection in his voice, like an accent slightly out of time. He was polite though and sounded genuinely happy someone had contacted him about the offer.

“Oh, thank you for the call, my name is Mr. Penny. I'm so glad you are interested in working with us at Aurora Ridge. I would like to arrange a short meeting and introductory tour if you are still interested in the job.” I was thrilled and eagerly responded,

“Yes, thank you Mr. Penny. I would love to, when can we meet?”

“Well tonight at 9:30 pm would work for me, if it works for you.” I paused for a moment, surprised that it would be an interview the same night I had inquired and be so late in the evening. I did not second guess it though, I agreed, and Mr. Penny sounded delighted, almost like I was doing him a favor.

“Oh fantastic, looking forward to seeing you here. Always happy to work with a new soul, take care and see you then.” He hung up and despite how odd the arrangement was, I was happy I might have a paycheck again.

I set out at 9:00pm, leaving a bit of time to get there early, since Aurora Ridge was only a ten-minute drive from my apartment based on the directions.

The place seemed to be nestled out of the way, off the main road leading into town. When I first arrived, I had to double check that I was at the right place. I kept driving a little further on a dirt road and practically into the forest.

When I came upon the main gate I was relieved. A tall iron fence crossed the clearing, and I saw the sign by the main gate and knew I was there. It read,

“Welcome to Aurora Ridge Cemetery, where the light of lives rest eternal.” The gate was closed and when I stepped out of my car I was dismayed when I saw it was locked as well. I guessed I would just have to wait until Mr. Penny was there to let me in.

I waited for a while and when I checked my phone, it was 9:40pm. I was getting worried that I had been tricked and that no one would show up. As I nervously glanced around the area, the light faded further and twilight glowed in the distance. Something about it was odd and made me do a double take. I thought I saw a strange light in the sky. It looked like it was coming from somewhere on the grounds, but further inside the cemetery.

The strange thing was that the light was not in any shade of twilight I had ever seen. It was a sort of green, like one might see in the northern lights. It stood out amongst the other colors and the more I stared at the shifting pattern in the sky, the more unnatural the green light seemed to be. It lingered when the other colors faded away into the darkness of night, like it had a strange phosphorescence.

The odd viewing of the lights was interrupted when I heard a car approaching and I looked and saw a large hearse driving down the road. It pulled up slowly and I could hear the pained grinding of the ancient vehicle, and it lurched to a halt.

A man stepped out of the hearse. He wore a jet black suit and was very tall, but rail thin. Oddly, he also wore a pair of sunglasses that looked glaringly out of place in the dark night. He straightened his jacket and slid a hand back over his thin gray hair. He smiled when he saw me and walked over with a distinct, almost theatrical stride. He reached the gate and unlocked it and he sauntered towards me as the gate yawned open.

“Hello, Ben was it? Pleased to meet you. I trust you found the place alright?” I shook his outstretched hand and he gripped me disturbingly tightly. He kept smiling and shaking until I let go and responded,

“Yes thank you sir, though I was afraid you might not be coming.”

Mr. Penny looked apologetic,

“Yes I know, so sorry for the inconvenience. I had to make a last minute pickup and I was delayed. Though I should give more care to the living, after all the dead can wait.” He chuckled at his own words, like an inside joke. He laughed it off and shrugged,

“Well then shall we?”  He ushered me forward and we stepped in together.

Mr. Penny had insisted we walk, promising that the site was not far. Though as we moved I was struck by just how empty the place seemed to be. Only about a dozen gravestones lay scattered throughout the cemetery. As if reading my mind, Mr. Penny spoke as we walked.

“You might notice the scarcity of graves here. Though our business is new, the lot is ancient. We have more residents here than it appears, but age, degradation and a rather distressing incident have destroyed many of the plots and stones. We still keep the grounds, but leave the other resting places unmarked and undisturbed.”

I thought I saw that odd green light in the distance again before Mr. Penny pointed to a small building we were moving past.

“That is the Groundskeepers building. Old Horus tends the grounds in the day, you might see him on the way out on some nights, but he does not normally stay after dark.”

I nodded my head and we moved up the gentle hill toward a larger building in the distance. The green glow was gone and I started to wonder if I had really seen it at all.

Mr. Penny spoke up again and pointed to the building,

“Here we are, please follow me if you would. The station is here and we will discuss the job further, but the sight that really matters is just a short way further up the hill. We will get to that and more, assuming you agree to take the position.” He smiled awkwardly and I was confused by the comment. I thought I was guarding the entire cemetery. What was this other site?

The security station came into clearer view as we moved closer, and I saw it had a strange, almost tower like lookout that jutted out of the roof, giving it the impression of a lighthouse looking out over a vast ocean of the buried dead.

We walked up to the door and he fumbled with a large ring of keys. He glanced at me apologetically as he tried a few to no effect. Finally, the door opened on rusty hinges, and he held out a hand to invite me in.

We walked inside and I saw it resembled a sparse cabin. Barely any furniture, besides a table, chair and a small footlocker. It was not what I had expected, I thought there might at least be a monitor and some security cameras. Near the corner I saw the only other door and a ladder that must lead to the odd lookout tower.

The door closed behind us and it focused my attention back on Mr. Penny.

“Well then, please take a chair, don’t worry I'll stand, seeing as how there is not an abundance of chairs.” He chuckled halfheartedly, and I smiled slightly to not disappoint his attempt at humor.

“Here at Aurora Ridge, we value hard work and integrity. But we need to know we can trust you to do your best and not let base fears get in the way of your contributions. So, I must ask, are you afraid of the dead and their resting places?” I was taken off guard by the question, but I guessed it must be some sort of interview he was doing first so I answered honestly,

“No, I’m not afraid of the dead or cemeteries sir.”

He smiled at my answer,

“Good, very good. Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?”

I replied, “No.” Once again. Mr. Penny nodded his head and continued,

“Good. You see many employees have left this job in the past. It is not for the faint of heart. I know it seems straightforward, just guarding the grounds at night. But alone and in the dark....”He paused, while fixing his stare on me and adjusting his sunglasses, but not taking them off.

“Well people forget themselves, start to see things. The mind gets tired, fantastical stories start becoming believable, and even skeptics can start to believe absurd things. So, I assure you, if you follow the rules and do not give in to crazy musings, you will do well.” His smile was back and I was wondering how many people had this job before.

“Speaking of doing well, we pay well for this position. The stress it puts on the mind can be harrowing, and we like to offer our night guardsmen something akin to hazard pay. Therefore, we are willing to offer a salary of $3000 a week.”

My jaw almost hit the floor when I heard how much it paid. I had no idea what sort of security job paid that much, but I was stunned by the offer.

“I see I have your attention, good. I will take that as a yes then?”

I was already nodding my head eagerly, before he had even gotten into the particulars of the job.

“Good very good, he smiled and held out his hand.” I shook it without even thinking to ask why the pay was so significant and why he had called it “Hazard pay”

“Well then, please if you would, follow me. We have a special place to visit, and I need you to listen closely. The instructions are paramount to your success. I nodded my head and opened a note app on my phone.

Mr. Penny led the way on a small path, lit only by the dim light of a small row of solar stake lamps. We ascended the hill and the path led into what looked like a thicket. Mr. Penny walked on, unbothered, and gestured me to follow.

The small drape of plant life brushed away easily, and a somewhat concealed glen rested beyond. The area was hauntingly beautiful. Flowers grew around the soft green grass, and fireflies danced around a small tree near the center. The pretty ambiance distracted from the other key features in this tiny clearing.

Near the center of the glen, were four evenly spaced gravestones. They were fairly large but not imposing. And each one had a small string hanging above them, connected to tiny bells. I thought it was odd, grave bells were not used anymore, since modern medical science had long since determined a way to verify if someone was truly deceased. Beyond the four graves was a small, but intricately detailed mausoleum.

The sight of all the scenery was jarring. I took another step toward the surreal resting place. Suddenly Mr. Penny grabbed my shoulder, holding me back momentarily. He was looking at me as if appraising my reaction.

“Beautiful isn't it? An oasis of calm, separate from the drudgery of life. Your first and most important job is keeping this place safe. I know you have many questions, but I am going to explain the most important expectations regarding security here at Aurora Ridge. Failure to comply with them will result in .... consequences, understood?” I nodded my head at his sudden change of tone,

“Good, very good. I will be sure to remind you of that commitment. In fact your predecessor had to be terminated for failing to follow protocol. So if you wish to remain, you will listen carefully.""

He sounded serious and I nodded my head and listened to the instructions.

“Your work hours will be 10:00pm to 6:00am. You are not to leave until 6:00am unless expressly authorized.”

“Breaks can be taken within reason, but you may not leave the grounds during breaks. You must stay at your post. Lunch's must be brought in with you, no delivery services of course.”

“Bathroom breaks are of course permitted, but time should be strictly monitored. Sound systems should continue to be verified even during restroom breaks to ensure fast response should something happen.”

“You are not to disturb the grounds directly, no going past or disturbing this line. Especially no going near the graves.”

I looked to where he was pointing and it was the small white line that seemed to stretch on to the left and right. My foot had almost crossed it and I realized that was why Mr. Penny had stopped me. At first it looked like it was drawn on like a football field, but I noticed when I looked closer it seemed to be made of salt.

Mr. Penny waited until I looked back up at him and continued.

“Absolutely no trespassers. We are closed at night. Any and all trespassers must be detained and dealt with. There is a channel on the radio that you must call if intruders are detected, channel six. Your job is observation, other security personnel will detain them, prior to removal by law enforcement, understood? ”

I nodded my head again and he moved on,

“Sometimes external influences can disrupt the lines of demarcation, if this occurs, please re-apply the security salt to ensure the ring stays whole at all times.”

“This last rule is critical; you must abide. Are you paying attention?” He asked sharply. I nodded my head and confirmed.

“If the graveyard bells ring, even if it is just one. You are to press the SOS  button on your radio to signal the event. Then you must evacuate immediately. You will have exactly three minutes to make your way up the hill and to the mausoleum outside the ring. Then you are to use this key and enter the mausoleum, close the door and wait until morning, no earlier than 6:00am. Do you understand?”

It was the strangest request so far; I had no idea why the bells would ring. Unless someone was buried alive....

I couldn't help but ask after that one,

“But sir why would they...” Mr. Penny cut me off,

“They almost never do, but strange things can happen here. Even if you think it is just the wind, it's better to be safe than sorry. Go to the mausoleum, lock up and stay put. Any interaction with the bells after they ring, even waiting to watch what happens after the first three minutes will be..... a problem. Nothing will happen to you if you follow the rules, understand?”

I was concerned and very skeptical, but I was more desperate to have a paycheck again. I figured I would follow whatever superstitious rules I was given if it meant not being broke anymore. I nodded my head and agreed,

“Yes.”

Mr. Penny beamed at my response,

“Excellent, well then if that's all settled I will show you to the tower. We have the watch tower there to keep a safe eye on the place while keeping a respectful distance. There are night vision binoculars, a directional microphone, and a radio there. Along with spare batteries for the lot back in the security building. The station also has a small restroom which we have stored some extra salt in as well, should you need to reapply it.”

He led me back to the building and I stepped inside. I saw the small footlocker that he mentioned the devices were in. When I turned back and saw Mr. Penny was not coming inside, he did an about face and smiled,

“Oh I’m sorry, I forgot to mention, I need you to start tonight, I hope that's alright?” I was surprised, but felt like I couldn't say no without jeopardizing the opportunity, so I reluctantly agreed,

“Yeah, I mean yes of course.”

“Fantastic, I knew I was right about you, take care and keep your eyes peeled and ears open. Have a good night my friend.”

He closed the door and just like that I was alone at my new job, watching over a small grave site for an absurd salary and following a bizarre list of rules.

I looked around again briefly and realized I should probably head up the small tower and take a look from my vantage. It sounded like I was going to spend most of my nights there.

I opened the footlocker near the ladder and removed a surprisingly nice and expensive looking pair of night vision binoculars. I switched it on and the battery charge was full. There was also a small directional microphone, which had a wireless headset it connected to. I also grabbed the handheld radio and switched it on. I stowed the items and climbed the ladder to the lonesome tower.

I saw a folding chair set aside in the lookout and was grateful that I was not expected to stand there for hours on end. Though I regretted not bringing something to help pass the time. I had not expected to work that night, but with the knowledge of the payday I had in store, a few boring hours watching some graves was nothing.

I grabbed the small chair, unfolded it and set it up so it would be facing toward the hill I had to watch. When I sat down, I saw that I had a good view of the surroundings acres of grounds. It was all positioned just right to see directly into the little glen that housed my charge.

While looking closer with the binoculars, I noticed something odd. None of the four special gravestones had any names, or any markings on them. They were all blank. I found it strange, but once again I did not question my fortune in guarding them.

After an hour and a half, my eyes started to get tired constantly looking out at the site. The perimeter ring was undisturbed; nothing was moving about. Barely even a breeze to disturb the dead silence of it all. I switched over to the directional microphone and pointed it at the site to confirm.

As I had expected there was nothing, at first. Then I thought I heard a low groaning, creaking sound. It was odd, but not too concerning. After a while I started hearing another sound, like a persistent scratching and tapping.

It continued for half an hour and I was about to go investigate. Then it suddenly stopped just as I was about to go back down. I managed to make it through the rest of the night with no further issues.

Almost the entire first week was uneventful, but on Friday, something happened.

I had a routine prepared for the long haul, including snacks and entertainment to pass the time while staying focused on my objective. I couldn't listen to anything since I had to keep an ear out for the bells on the microphone, but I was able to steal a few moments of time to read a book. I wanted to use my phone, but reception was bad so it was a nonstarter.

I made it through almost the entire night and was so engrossed by the book I was reading that I did not pick up on the sounds coming through the mic at first. It took me a second to realize I was hearing voices coming from the tree line. I propped the mic up so I could still hear and grabbed the binoculars. I looked out at the graves and did not see anything at first. Then I saw rustling in the foliage near the mausoleum and three figures emerged. I had to do something, they were heading for the site. I heard the voices speaking clearer as I trained the mic directly on them,

“How did we even get this far Erin? And what light are you talking about? It is too dark to see anything out here.” The first voice spoke, sounding like a young man. Another responded to the question curtly,

“I know what I saw Jess, there was a weird green light, it was coming from here, it didn't look natural.”

“Guys we shouldn't be here, this place, there's something not right about it.” Another voice spoke up, meek and concerned. She was right about one thing they shouldn't be there. I had to figure out what to do.

I remembered the instructions and switched on the radio to channel six.

“This is Ben, in the tower. There are three trespassers by the site, going down now to investigate.” There was no response, so I just moved on, grabbing my flashlight and rushing downstairs.

I sprinted toward the glen and made it through just in time to see the three strangers stepping over and disrupting the salt line. They all looked fairly young, two girls and a boy, probably in their teens. I shouted out a warning,

“Stop! This is private property!” Two of them held up their hands, even though it was only a flashlight I was holding. The third looked at me with a mixture of confusion and fascination.

“What is this place?” The girl had asked, sounding like she was speaking while in a dream.

The other two looked scared and confused. I spoke again, slightly softer than before.

“This is private property and a graveyard satisfied? Now clear off. You are not supposed to be here.” I tried to sound commanding, but not overly hostile.

Her two friends shrunk back, clearly not wanting to get in trouble, but she stepped forward and asked me a surprising question,

“I came for the light; did you see it too? There was something in it, it called me here.” I shined my flashlight on her and her expression looked oddly distant. The mention of the light was weird. I remembered the green light I had seen the first day. Maybe this group had seen it too? I felt guilty for detaining them, but knew I had to get them to leave. I lowered my hands, and tried to get them to listen.

“I’m not sure what light you think called you here, but you all should get back home, it is late and you look like high schoolers. Your parents must be worried. Do you live close?”

The girl in the middle, Erin as I had heard her friends call her, offered an odd response.

“I... don’t know. I can't remember?” She sounded scared suddenly. The other two looked at her and then at each other. I shined the light on them again and I saw their eyes were glassy. I thought they might have taken some psychedelics or something, since they did not seem to be all there. Then when I looked closer, I saw a hint of unnatural green light reflecting off their eyes.

The effect was eerie, and I decided to lead them out of there. I hoped they had a number I could call to have their parents pick them up. I explained my plan to them and they agreed.

“Yeah....yeah lets go, I think it was a mistake coming here. Somethings wrong with this place, I don’t like it.” The boy said as if waking up from a dream. The girls nodded and suddenly looked more lucid than when they had arrived. I was relieved and started ushering them out.

But before I could show the way back, I was startled when I heard a loudspeaker demanding that the group,

“Freeze!” It was two large men in riot style security gear. I did not know why they were there, but then I remembered the radio call. I tried to explain the situation, but the two men brushed past me and seized two of the teenagers roughly. I tried to protest, but one of them knocked me down in the pursuit and I fell hard.

Erin had tried to get away, even while her friends had been seized, but as she reached the tree line, a third figure grabbed her. It was Mr. Penny. The teens protested and struggled, and I did not like the force that the others were using to detain them. Before I could voice my concern, Mr. Penny spoke.

“Very good Ben, nice work. Looks like we got here before they could do any damage. We will escort them off the premises, after some community service.” I replied, trying to see if I could help.

“Thank you, sir. Though they don't seem like they came here to cause trouble, maybe we can let them go without involving the police?”

Mr. Penny chuckled then responded.

“Oh they should be so lucky, no we will let them go, after they re-salt the circle. Then we will put them back where they belong. But you must not concern yourself, since we are here and will be repairing the damage, you are free to go for the last few hours. Go home and get some sleep, I will handle it from here.”

I did not like the situation. I looked at the teens and they were not shouting or protesting; they just seemed to be staring at the graves, like they were in a trance. I thought I saw the weird light emerging from the ground for a split second before it was gone.

Then I saw the two men in riot gear holding large bags of salt. It looked like one of them was moving tools and I thought I saw a shovel in his hands.

My heartbeat quickened and I was getting nervous about what was happening. But as I was about to protest going home, Mr. Penny stood up and walked over to me. He put an arm on my shoulder and turned me around to face him directly, I saw he was holding his sunglasses in his hand and I realized it was the first time I had seen him take them off.

“Don’t work too hard. Just go home...now.”

I remembered looking up and facing him. After that I don’t remember what I saw.

The next thing I knew it was 6:15am. I was asleep in my car, parked just outside my apartment. I had no recollection of how I got back. Somehow, I had left, driven home and fell asleep in my car in those last two hours.

Something was seriously wrong, but I had no way of explaining just what it was.  I had wanted to talk to Mr. Penny about the strange experience, but he was absent for most of the next week. I grew more nervous about what had happened, but I kept going back. I did not like it, but felt like I had no choice.

That weekend I had another strange experience. Someone was knocking on my apartment door that Saturday night. When I answered it, I saw a large bald man standing there.  He stared at me for a moment before doing anything, then pulled out a small manilla folder and handed it to me. I was confused, but when I looked, I saw it had $3000 in cash stuffed inside. The large man spoke, in a dull monotone voice,

“Aurora Ridge thanks you for your work, have a good evening.” The man reached into his coat and pulled out a pair of sunglasses that looked a lot like Mr. Pennys and just as he was about to place them on his head, I swear I saw a glint of green that did not look natural. He turned and walked away.

When I returned on Monday night, I found that I had a visitor. It was not Mr. Penny, but an ancient, looking man who wore the dirt speckled coveralls of the groundskeeper.

He looked me up and down and scoffed as I entered. I waved to greet him and knew it must be Horus.

He was holding a large bag of salt and I saw several more in the corner.  He scowled, then finally spoke,

“You must be Charlie's replacement. Haven't seen that big bald bastard around but he owes me a pack of cigarettes. Though if you're here it means old Charlie must have made a mistake. Anyway it‘s windy tonight. I brought extra salt. You are going to need it, don't let the line break. I don’t want that light anywhere near the garden or anywhere else where it can get into. Don’t forget or its your ass!” He brushed past me and shot me one last hateful look before departing, slamming the rattling door as he did.

I was shocked and confused, what happened to Charlie? Then I considered the large bald man I had not seen before who delivered my pay. He sounded a lot like this Charlie, but hadn't he been fired? Either way it did not matter, I had to get to work.

I climbed the ladder up to the lookout and after the first thirty minutes the wind whipped up so strongly that the lines of salt began to blow away and several sections were barren. I nearly spat out my coffee and knew I had to get down there quickly.

I rushed back down and grabbed one of the bags of salt Horus had left. It was heavy and I wished I had some way of moving multiple bags, but there was no dolly or truck to do so. I hefted the bag up the hill and opened it, moving to where I had seen the broken section of the ring, and started pouring. As soon as I had finished, I saw more sections required repair. I made several more trips and was getting tired quickly.

I managed to patch all the larger holes in the line, but there was one last segment that had a visible break. I had to stop and catch my breath for a moment. Then I could go get another bag and fix it.

As I sat there and looked at the silent site, I shuddered when I remembered the night where the teens had broken in. I hoped that Mr. Penny had let them go like he said he would. I did not like the way they looked at the strange light or how I had lost the last two hours of my night when I tried to ask him about it.

As I caught my breath, I saw something inexplicable. There was a corona of that green light emerging from the ground near the edge where the break in the line was. I saw a small opossum walk toward the light. It moved in a straight line and did not seem bothered by the fact that I was watching it.

Then I saw the light seemed to stretch out and beyond the ring and reach out to the small animal. The glint of green that reflected in its eyes was terrible, and I stood up and rushed back down the hill to grab another bag and complete the circle again.

When I got back the animal was gone. I could not be sure, but I thought I saw scratch marks on the ground near the ring, like something had tried digging there. I finished the ring and mercifully the wind had died down. As I tried to understand what had just happened, I heard something that froze my heart. I heard the chiming of a bell.

I looked on in horror as one of the gravestone bells was slowly ringing. It was not the wind, it was not any external force. The bell was ringing and I had to act fast. I pressed the SOS button on the radio as I had been instructed and looked at the stone mausoleum nearby.

A morbid part of me wanted to wait and see what was happening. It had to be some trick, it couldn't really be ringing on its own. But I had no time for questions, I remembered Mr. Penny’s warning and went to the mausoleum, searched for the silver key and opened it.

I took one last look outside and confirmed that the small bell was still ringing, before closing the heavy door and locking it again, sealing me off from whatever was happening outside. I expected something at the three-minute mark, but I heard nothing. There was no window so I couldn't see anything, but I swear I saw that damnable green light glowing softly from somewhere near the graves and peaking under the heavy door.

I realized I still had my headset for the directional mic turned on. I had propped the mic on the chair, pointing down at the graves while I moved the salt. When I put the headphones on I heard an odd static. I was not sure what could be making the sounds, but after waiting for almost an hour, I heard something else. It was a consistent scraping, digging sound, followed by a loud crash, like someone hitting wood with metal. I held my breath and after a long moment I thought I heard a voice,

“No, not yet. This one needs more time, they aren't ready. Just a bit more, put them back.”

Then I heard the wooden crash again, followed by more digging. After a while all the sounds had fallen silent. I was left cold and alone, in that dark tomb, terrified, but ultimately oblivious to what had just occurred right outside.

I considered asking Mr. Penny about the bells again, but I did not know if I could trust whatever his answer might be. Whatever was going on at Aurora Ridge, it was getting more concerning by the day.

I spent almost another entire week there, in tense anticipation of something terrible happening. I was getting freaked out and despite the large payday, I was not sure it was smart to keep showing up.

It was Thursday on week three, that the reality of the situation was laid bare, and I saw the thing I could never unsee.

It was a particularly cold night, and I feared the wind would whip the salt off the ring again, or worse I would hear the bells. I was already on edge, when I arrived and when I saw the rain beginning to fall, my mood did not improve. I climbed the ladder to my lookout and struggled to hear anything over the deluge of rain. I paned around with my binoculars and saw the hideous aurora of light emerging and reflecting the water in the air like a disturbing mono colored rainbow.

I wanted to look away but the sight was captivating. I felt myself being drawn into the morbid spectacle and I took an involuntary step forward. I managed to stop myself before I fell over the edge. Something clattered down the roof and smashed into the ground and I realized I had dropped the directional microphone.

I cursed my bad luck but was grateful it had been that and not me that fell over. I looked over at the grave site and saw something surprising. Despite the wind moving the salt the other day, the water from the rain did not seem to be dissolving the ring like I had expected.

I was ready to bolt down and reapply it when I knew the rain was falling, but somehow it had stayed there, unaffected. I tried to distract myself by reading for a while, but I was paranoid by the lack of a microphone. I had gone down to the footlocker to find another but it was empty. There must have only been one. I tried the radio to call for help and get another, but all I got was static.

Since I could not hear anything, I tried to be hyper vigilant with the binoculars and looked around frequently. In another few hours I was getting tired, but was glad the terrible night was almost over. All the coffee I had that night made forced me to take a restroom break. When I got back up the ladder I looked out again, expecting to see nothing but rain splashing off the ground. Instead I saw movement. To my horror, I looked again and saw three of the four bells ringing side to side. I had no idea how long they had been ringing at that point.

I panicked and pressed the SOS button on the radio, Then I half climbed, half slid down the ladder, landing hard at the bottom.

I sprinted up the hill and as soon as I entered the clearing, I saw hellish light bathing the gravestones. The green glow seemed to pulse in time with the maddening chiming of the bells. I rushed to the mausoleum as the storm intensified. As I fumbled for the keys I felt an odd tinge of static that in the next instant made me involuntarily fall back.

I was glad I had leaped back, since in the next instant, a jagged bolt of incandescent green lightning struck near the mausoleum and hit with such tremendous force that a large cracked split a section off the front of the building.

I looked up in a terrible instance and saw the storm had taken on an otherworldly quality that made me dizzy to look at. I picked myself up, opened the door and dove into the mausoleum, closing it behind me.

As I tried to catch my breath after the insane events, I felt a chill and realized something was wrong, the structure was damaged, and I could see through the fractured facade of the mausoleum wall. I could see everything. A large group of hooded figures had appeared, gathered around the gravestone. One wore the distinct sunglasses of Mr. Penny. Others had shovels and were digging at the ground by the gravestones. Piles of dirt were dug up and cast aside, as they moved deeper. I heard three shovels striking wood in unison.

I looked on in numb horror as the green lighting struck the ground around where they had dug up three of the four graves. They bent down in unison and pulled the caskets out of the graves. I was not able to see who or what was in the coffins, but something about the way the reverently stood around them was disturbing.

I heard a ringing sound in my ears and a loud voice spoke out, it was terrible and commanding and I was shocked when I saw it was Mr. Penny who seemed to be speaking in a voice that sounded nothing like his own.

“Bring them forward.”

Two of the hooded figures brought a limp body up towards him and I nearly cried out when I saw the body and recognized the girl. It was Erin, one of the teens who had broken in with her friends to see the light. She was unresponsive, but Mr. Penny reached down and touched her head, then the two robed figured moved her body up toward him and he took off his glasses and I suppressed a horrified gasp as I saw the empty pits that hid underneath, he looked like he should be blind, he had no eyes! Yet he reached out to touch the face of the young girl and a terrible green light filled his hollow eyes and seemed to run down his hands and flow like a terrible river into Erin’s limp body.

Then the eldritch green light flashed, sparked, and a dull rumble was heard, followed by a gasp of air. She was alive, but as her eyes fluttered open, I saw the same inhuman green flame in them as well. They were about to repeat the ritual, when I heard mutterings and one of the robbed figures asked Mr. Penny about the fourth grave.

“He held up a finger and then pointed in my direction at the mausoleum and all I could hear was,

“Soon.”

I huddled down, unable to look at the blasphemous scene any longer. My head started to hurt and there was a ringing in my ears, then I blacked out. When I woke up it was morning. I stole a peek outside and saw that the grave sites were just as they had been before. Undisturbed, even the soil looked unbothered. I started to wonder if it could all have been a terrible nightmare. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, slowly turned around and left.

I drove home in a daze, conscious but bewildered. When I got back I tried to process what I saw that night. I decided to look into Mr.Penny and see if I could find something out about him. When I started looking, I was horrified at my revelation.

There was a V.Penny, the original owner of Aurora Ridge cemetery who had died eighty-five years ago. No known descendants, no family. I remembered the hollow eyes from that night, the green flames burning in his skull and I shuddered.

The terrible revelations continued when I saw on the news that three teens had been declared missing after failing to return home the previous week. When I saw their faces and heard the names announced my heart sank. It was the same three from that night, all of them had been standing right in front of me a little over a week ago.

The implications made me sick when I considered the graves, three of them, three people taken. Three bells ringing out, then the sight of one of them screaming back to life in the hands of Mr. Penny.

I stayed home that night. I could not sleep and the nervous tension made me paranoid. I started writing and someone knocked on my door. It was nearly midnight, and I grabbed a kitchen knife on my way to investigate. I looked out the peephole and nearly gasped aloud when I saw the face of that young girl, Erin. She was just standing there, smiling. I almost reached for the door but as I did she spoke.

“Hello Ben, please remember to call out if you are feeling sick in the future. Don’t forget it’s payday tomorrow. We have something for you back at Aurora Ridge, please come back. It won’t take long and you can finally find a place where you belong. Think of the light, the bell, the last one can be for you. Mr. Penny was right, I can see things now, things I could never see before. You can too.”

She left at some point, and I was alone again. That was last night. I have not left my apartment since then. They keep showing up, beckoning me back to that place where souls return to bath in that monstrous light that claims the living and the dead. In the distance I swear I could hear the fourth bell chiming for me. Calling me to the deepest parts of the earth, to find out the secrets of the chthonic realm of dark stone and death.

The sound is getting louder, but I will try and ignore it tonight. I need to finish this account. If anyone is reading this, do not trust the light, do not listen to the things it brings back and most of all do not listen to Mr. Penny, if he offers you something that is too good to be true.",1,1761717785.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

1oiwuhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oiwuhl/i_was_hired_to_watch_the_bells_on_four_graves_in/,I was hired to watch the bells on four graves in a cemetery. They were ringing last night and I think something bad is going to happen.,"My name is Ben, and in case something happens, I need to write down what I saw, or at least think I saw. Whether you believe me or not is up to you. I know what I am about to describe might sound crazy; I would have said it was impossible just a while ago.

I know I should have just walked away when I saw the red flags. I should have listened to my gut. Sometimes, a job is not worth it, regardless of the pay. Now I fear whatever I saw last night could be looking for me this very moment. I should have left the first time I heard the bells.

It started two weeks ago. I had lost my job and was looking for work. It had already been two months at that point since the factory closed and for the first time in years, I was unemployed.

When I was looking for places that were hiring online, I noticed I had received a strange email. It was a work advertisement.

“Now hiring, security personnel for night shift at Aurora Ridge Cemetery. Call for more details, no previous security experience required.”

I was glad to see a potential job prospect had come to me. I never thought to look for security jobs, and definitely not at a place like a cemetery. I decided to call the number listed. The line rang for a minute until someone answered. It was a man with an odd inflection in his voice, like an accent slightly out of time. He was polite though and sounded genuinely happy someone had contacted him about the offer.

“Oh, thank you for the call, my name is Mr. Penny. I'm so glad you are interested in working with us at Aurora Ridge. I would like to arrange a short meeting and introductory tour if you are still interested in the job.” I was thrilled and eagerly responded,

“Yes, thank you Mr. Penny. I would love to, when can we meet?”

“Well tonight at 9:30 pm would work for me, if it works for you.” I paused for a moment, surprised that it would be an interview the same night I had inquired and be so late in the evening. I did not second guess it though, I agreed, and Mr. Penny sounded delighted, almost like I was doing him a favor.

“Oh fantastic, looking forward to seeing you here. Always happy to work with a new soul, take care and see you then.” He hung up and despite how odd the arrangement was, I was happy I might have a paycheck again.

I set out at 9:00pm, leaving a bit of time to get there early, since Aurora Ridge was only a ten-minute drive from my apartment based on the directions.

The place seemed to be nestled out of the way, off the main road leading into town. When I first arrived, I had to double check that I was at the right place. I kept driving a little further on a dirt road and practically into the forest.

When I came upon the main gate I was relieved. A tall iron fence crossed the clearing, and I saw the sign by the main gate and knew I was there. It read,

“Welcome to Aurora Ridge Cemetery, where the light of lives rest eternal.” The gate was closed and when I stepped out of my car I was dismayed when I saw it was locked as well. I guessed I would just have to wait until Mr. Penny was there to let me in.

I waited for a while and when I checked my phone, it was 9:40pm. I was getting worried that I had been tricked and that no one would show up. As I nervously glanced around the area, the light faded further and twilight glowed in the distance. Something about it was odd and made me do a double take. I thought I saw a strange light in the sky. It looked like it was coming from somewhere on the grounds, but further inside the cemetery.

The strange thing was that the light was not in any shade of twilight I had ever seen. It was a sort of green, like one might see in the northern lights. It stood out amongst the other colors and the more I stared at the shifting pattern in the sky, the more unnatural the green light seemed to be. It lingered when the other colors faded away into the darkness of night, like it had a strange phosphorescence.

The odd viewing of the lights was interrupted when I heard a car approaching and I looked and saw a large hearse driving down the road. It pulled up slowly and I could hear the pained grinding of the ancient vehicle, and it lurched to a halt.

A man stepped out of the hearse. He wore a jet black suit and was very tall, but rail thin. Oddly, he also wore a pair of sunglasses that looked glaringly out of place in the dark night. He straightened his jacket and slid a hand back over his thin gray hair. He smiled when he saw me and walked over with a distinct, almost theatrical stride. He reached the gate and unlocked it and he sauntered towards me as the gate yawned open.

“Hello, Ben was it? Pleased to meet you. I trust you found the place alright?” I shook his outstretched hand and he gripped me disturbingly tightly. He kept smiling and shaking until I let go and responded,

“Yes thank you sir, though I was afraid you might not be coming.”

Mr. Penny looked apologetic,

“Yes I know, so sorry for the inconvenience. I had to make a last minute pickup and I was delayed. Though I should give more care to the living, after all the dead can wait.” He chuckled at his own words, like an inside joke. He laughed it off and shrugged,

“Well then shall we?”  He ushered me forward and we stepped in together.

Mr. Penny had insisted we walk, promising that the site was not far. Though as we moved I was struck by just how empty the place seemed to be. Only about a dozen gravestones lay scattered throughout the cemetery. As if reading my mind, Mr. Penny spoke as we walked.

“You might notice the scarcity of graves here. Though our business is new, the lot is ancient. We have more residents here than it appears, but age, degradation and a rather distressing incident have destroyed many of the plots and stones. We still keep the grounds, but leave the other resting places unmarked and undisturbed.”

I thought I saw that odd green light in the distance again before Mr. Penny pointed to a small building we were moving past.

“That is the Groundskeepers building. Old Horus tends the grounds in the day, you might see him on the way out on some nights, but he does not normally stay after dark.”

I nodded my head and we moved up the gentle hill toward a larger building in the distance. The green glow was gone and I started to wonder if I had really seen it at all.

Mr. Penny spoke up again and pointed to the building,

“Here we are, please follow me if you would. The station is here and we will discuss the job further, but the sight that really matters is just a short way further up the hill. We will get to that and more, assuming you agree to take the position.” He smiled awkwardly and I was confused by the comment. I thought I was guarding the entire cemetery. What was this other site?

The security station came into clearer view as we moved closer, and I saw it had a strange, almost tower like lookout that jutted out of the roof, giving it the impression of a lighthouse looking out over a vast ocean of the buried dead.

We walked up to the door and he fumbled with a large ring of keys. He glanced at me apologetically as he tried a few to no effect. Finally, the door opened on rusty hinges, and he held out a hand to invite me in.

We walked inside and I saw it resembled a sparse cabin. Barely any furniture, besides a table, chair and a small footlocker. It was not what I had expected, I thought there might at least be a monitor and some security cameras. Near the corner I saw the only other door and a ladder that must lead to the odd lookout tower.

The door closed behind us and it focused my attention back on Mr. Penny.

“Well then, please take a chair, don’t worry I'll stand, seeing as how there is not an abundance of chairs.” He chuckled halfheartedly, and I smiled slightly to not disappoint his attempt at humor.

“Here at Aurora Ridge, we value hard work and integrity. But we need to know we can trust you to do your best and not let base fears get in the way of your contributions. So, I must ask, are you afraid of the dead and their resting places?” I was taken off guard by the question, but I guessed it must be some sort of interview he was doing first so I answered honestly,

“No, I’m not afraid of the dead or cemeteries sir.”

He smiled at my answer,

“Good, very good. Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?”

I replied, “No.” Once again. Mr. Penny nodded his head and continued,

“Good. You see many employees have left this job in the past. It is not for the faint of heart. I know it seems straightforward, just guarding the grounds at night. But alone and in the dark....”He paused, while fixing his stare on me and adjusting his sunglasses, but not taking them off.

“Well people forget themselves, start to see things. The mind gets tired, fantastical stories start becoming believable, and even skeptics can start to believe absurd things. So, I assure you, if you follow the rules and do not give in to crazy musings, you will do well.” His smile was back and I was wondering how many people had this job before.

“Speaking of doing well, we pay well for this position. The stress it puts on the mind can be harrowing, and we like to offer our night guardsmen something akin to hazard pay. Therefore, we are willing to offer a salary of $3000 a week.”

My jaw almost hit the floor when I heard how much it paid. I had no idea what sort of security job paid that much, but I was stunned by the offer.

“I see I have your attention, good. I will take that as a yes then?”

I was already nodding my head eagerly, before he had even gotten into the particulars of the job.

“Good very good, he smiled and held out his hand.” I shook it without even thinking to ask why the pay was so significant and why he had called it “Hazard pay”

“Well then, please if you would, follow me. We have a special place to visit, and I need you to listen closely. The instructions are paramount to your success. I nodded my head and opened a note app on my phone.

Mr. Penny led the way on a small path, lit only by the dim light of a small row of solar stake lamps. We ascended the hill and the path led into what looked like a thicket. Mr. Penny walked on, unbothered, and gestured me to follow.

The small drape of plant life brushed away easily, and a somewhat concealed glen rested beyond. The area was hauntingly beautiful. Flowers grew around the soft green grass, and fireflies danced around a small tree near the center. The pretty ambiance distracted from the other key features in this tiny clearing.

Near the center of the glen, were four evenly spaced gravestones. They were fairly large but not imposing. And each one had a small string hanging above them, connected to tiny bells. I thought it was odd, grave bells were not used anymore, since modern medical science had long since determined a way to verify if someone was truly deceased. Beyond the four graves was a small, but intricately detailed mausoleum.

The sight of all the scenery was jarring. I took another step toward the surreal resting place. Suddenly Mr. Penny grabbed my shoulder, holding me back momentarily. He was looking at me as if appraising my reaction.

“Beautiful isn't it? An oasis of calm, separate from the drudgery of life. Your first and most important job is keeping this place safe. I know you have many questions, but I am going to explain the most important expectations regarding security here at Aurora Ridge. Failure to comply with them will result in .... consequences, understood?” I nodded my head at his sudden change of tone,

“Good, very good. I will be sure to remind you of that commitment. In fact your predecessor had to be terminated for failing to follow protocol. So if you wish to remain, you will listen carefully.""

He sounded serious and I nodded my head and listened to the instructions.

“Your work hours will be 10:00pm to 6:00am. You are not to leave until 6:00am unless expressly authorized.”

“Breaks can be taken within reason, but you may not leave the grounds during breaks. You must stay at your post. Lunch's must be brought in with you, no delivery services of course.”

“Bathroom breaks are of course permitted, but time should be strictly monitored. Sound systems should continue to be verified even during restroom breaks to ensure fast response should something happen.”

“You are not to disturb the grounds directly, no going past or disturbing this line. Especially no going near the graves.”

I looked to where he was pointing and it was the small white line that seemed to stretch on to the left and right. My foot had almost crossed it and I realized that was why Mr. Penny had stopped me. At first it looked like it was drawn on like a football field, but I noticed when I looked closer it seemed to be made of salt.

Mr. Penny waited until I looked back up at him and continued.

“Absolutely no trespassers. We are closed at night. Any and all trespassers must be detained and dealt with. There is a channel on the radio that you must call if intruders are detected, channel six. Your job is observation, other security personnel will detain them, prior to removal by law enforcement, understood? ”

I nodded my head again and he moved on,

“Sometimes external influences can disrupt the lines of demarcation, if this occurs, please re-apply the security salt to ensure the ring stays whole at all times.”

“This last rule is critical; you must abide. Are you paying attention?” He asked sharply. I nodded my head and confirmed.

“If the graveyard bells ring, even if it is just one. You are to press the SOS  button on your radio to signal the event. Then you must evacuate immediately. You will have exactly three minutes to make your way up the hill and to the mausoleum outside the ring. Then you are to use this key and enter the mausoleum, close the door and wait until morning, no earlier than 6:00am. Do you understand?”

It was the strangest request so far; I had no idea why the bells would ring. Unless someone was buried alive....

I couldn't help but ask after that one,

“But sir why would they...” Mr. Penny cut me off,

“They almost never do, but strange things can happen here. Even if you think it is just the wind, it's better to be safe than sorry. Go to the mausoleum, lock up and stay put. Any interaction with the bells after they ring, even waiting to watch what happens after the first three minutes will be..... a problem. Nothing will happen to you if you follow the rules, understand?”

I was concerned and very skeptical, but I was more desperate to have a paycheck again. I figured I would follow whatever superstitious rules I was given if it meant not being broke anymore. I nodded my head and agreed,

“Yes.”

Mr. Penny beamed at my response,

“Excellent, well then if that's all settled I will show you to the tower. We have the watch tower there to keep a safe eye on the place while keeping a respectful distance. There are night vision binoculars, a directional microphone, and a radio there. Along with spare batteries for the lot back in the security building. The station also has a small restroom which we have stored some extra salt in as well, should you need to reapply it.”

He led me back to the building and I stepped inside. I saw the small footlocker that he mentioned the devices were in. When I turned back and saw Mr. Penny was not coming inside, he did an about face and smiled,

“Oh I’m sorry, I forgot to mention, I need you to start tonight, I hope that's alright?” I was surprised, but felt like I couldn't say no without jeopardizing the opportunity, so I reluctantly agreed,

“Yeah, I mean yes of course.”

“Fantastic, I knew I was right about you, take care and keep your eyes peeled and ears open. Have a good night my friend.”

He closed the door and just like that I was alone at my new job, watching over a small grave site for an absurd salary and following a bizarre list of rules.

I looked around again briefly and realized I should probably head up the small tower and take a look from my vantage. It sounded like I was going to spend most of my nights there.

I opened the footlocker near the ladder and removed a surprisingly nice and expensive looking pair of night vision binoculars. I switched it on and the battery charge was full. There was also a small directional microphone, which had a wireless headset it connected to. I also grabbed the handheld radio and switched it on. I stowed the items and climbed the ladder to the lonesome tower.

I saw a folding chair set aside in the lookout and was grateful that I was not expected to stand there for hours on end. Though I regretted not bringing something to help pass the time. I had not expected to work that night, but with the knowledge of the payday I had in store, a few boring hours watching some graves was nothing.

I grabbed the small chair, unfolded it and set it up so it would be facing toward the hill I had to watch. When I sat down, I saw that I had a good view of the surroundings acres of grounds. It was all positioned just right to see directly into the little glen that housed my charge.

While looking closer with the binoculars, I noticed something odd. None of the four special gravestones had any names, or any markings on them. They were all blank. I found it strange, but once again I did not question my fortune in guarding them.

After an hour and a half, my eyes started to get tired constantly looking out at the site. The perimeter ring was undisturbed; nothing was moving about. Barely even a breeze to disturb the dead silence of it all. I switched over to the directional microphone and pointed it at the site to confirm.

As I had expected there was nothing, at first. Then I thought I heard a low groaning, creaking sound. It was odd, but not too concerning. After a while I started hearing another sound, like a persistent scratching and tapping.

It continued for half an hour and I was about to go investigate. Then it suddenly stopped just as I was about to go back down. I managed to make it through the rest of the night with no further issues.

Almost the entire first week was uneventful, but on Friday, something happened.

I had a routine prepared for the long haul, including snacks and entertainment to pass the time while staying focused on my objective. I couldn't listen to anything since I had to keep an ear out for the bells on the microphone, but I was able to steal a few moments of time to read a book. I wanted to use my phone, but reception was bad so it was a nonstarter.

I made it through almost the entire night and was so engrossed by the book I was reading that I did not pick up on the sounds coming through the mic at first. It took me a second to realize I was hearing voices coming from the tree line. I propped the mic up so I could still hear and grabbed the binoculars. I looked out at the graves and did not see anything at first. Then I saw rustling in the foliage near the mausoleum and three figures emerged. I had to do something, they were heading for the site. I heard the voices speaking clearer as I trained the mic directly on them,

“How did we even get this far Erin? And what light are you talking about? It is too dark to see anything out here.” The first voice spoke, sounding like a young man. Another responded to the question curtly,

“I know what I saw Jess, there was a weird green light, it was coming from here, it didn't look natural.”

“Guys we shouldn't be here, this place, there's something not right about it.” Another voice spoke up, meek and concerned. She was right about one thing they shouldn't be there. I had to figure out what to do.

I remembered the instructions and switched on the radio to channel six.

“This is Ben, in the tower. There are three trespassers by the site, going down now to investigate.” There was no response, so I just moved on, grabbing my flashlight and rushing downstairs.

I sprinted toward the glen and made it through just in time to see the three strangers stepping over and disrupting the salt line. They all looked fairly young, two girls and a boy, probably in their teens. I shouted out a warning,

“Stop! This is private property!” Two of them held up their hands, even though it was only a flashlight I was holding. The third looked at me with a mixture of confusion and fascination.

“What is this place?” The girl had asked, sounding like she was speaking while in a dream.

The other two looked scared and confused. I spoke again, slightly softer than before.

“This is private property and a graveyard satisfied? Now clear off. You are not supposed to be here.” I tried to sound commanding, but not overly hostile.

Her two friends shrunk back, clearly not wanting to get in trouble, but she stepped forward and asked me a surprising question,

“I came for the light; did you see it too? There was something in it, it called me here.” I shined my flashlight on her and her expression looked oddly distant. The mention of the light was weird. I remembered the green light I had seen the first day. Maybe this group had seen it too? I felt guilty for detaining them, but knew I had to get them to leave. I lowered my hands, and tried to get them to listen.

“I’m not sure what light you think called you here, but you all should get back home, it is late and you look like high schoolers. Your parents must be worried. Do you live close?”

The girl in the middle, Erin as I had heard her friends call her, offered an odd response.

“I... don’t know. I can't remember?” She sounded scared suddenly. The other two looked at her and then at each other. I shined the light on them again and I saw their eyes were glassy. I thought they might have taken some psychedelics or something, since they did not seem to be all there. Then when I looked closer, I saw a hint of unnatural green light reflecting off their eyes.

The effect was eerie, and I decided to lead them out of there. I hoped they had a number I could call to have their parents pick them up. I explained my plan to them and they agreed.

“Yeah....yeah lets go, I think it was a mistake coming here. Somethings wrong with this place, I don’t like it.” The boy said as if waking up from a dream. The girls nodded and suddenly looked more lucid than when they had arrived. I was relieved and started ushering them out.

But before I could show the way back, I was startled when I heard a loudspeaker demanding that the group,

“Freeze!” It was two large men in riot style security gear. I did not know why they were there, but then I remembered the radio call. I tried to explain the situation, but the two men brushed past me and seized two of the teenagers roughly. I tried to protest, but one of them knocked me down in the pursuit and I fell hard.

Erin had tried to get away, even while her friends had been seized, but as she reached the tree line, a third figure grabbed her. It was Mr. Penny. The teens protested and struggled, and I did not like the force that the others were using to detain them. Before I could voice my concern, Mr. Penny spoke.

“Very good Ben, nice work. Looks like we got here before they could do any damage. We will escort them off the premises, after some community service.” I replied, trying to see if I could help.

“Thank you, sir. Though they don't seem like they came here to cause trouble, maybe we can let them go without involving the police?”

Mr. Penny chuckled then responded.

“Oh they should be so lucky, no we will let them go, after they re-salt the circle. Then we will put them back where they belong. But you must not concern yourself, since we are here and will be repairing the damage, you are free to go for the last few hours. Go home and get some sleep, I will handle it from here.”

I did not like the situation. I looked at the teens and they were not shouting or protesting; they just seemed to be staring at the graves, like they were in a trance. I thought I saw the weird light emerging from the ground for a split second before it was gone.

Then I saw the two men in riot gear holding large bags of salt. It looked like one of them was moving tools and I thought I saw a shovel in his hands.

My heartbeat quickened and I was getting nervous about what was happening. But as I was about to protest going home, Mr. Penny stood up and walked over to me. He put an arm on my shoulder and turned me around to face him directly, I saw he was holding his sunglasses in his hand and I realized it was the first time I had seen him take them off.

“Don’t work too hard. Just go home...now.”

I remembered looking up and facing him. After that I don’t remember what I saw.

The next thing I knew it was 6:15am. I was asleep in my car, parked just outside my apartment. I had no recollection of how I got back. Somehow, I had left, driven home and fell asleep in my car in those last two hours.

Something was seriously wrong, but I had no way of explaining just what it was.  I had wanted to talk to Mr. Penny about the strange experience, but he was absent for most of the next week. I grew more nervous about what had happened, but I kept going back. I did not like it, but felt like I had no choice.

That weekend I had another strange experience. Someone was knocking on my apartment door that Saturday night. When I answered it, I saw a large bald man standing there.  He stared at me for a moment before doing anything, then pulled out a small manilla folder and handed it to me. I was confused, but when I looked, I saw it had $3000 in cash stuffed inside. The large man spoke, in a dull monotone voice,

“Aurora Ridge thanks you for your work, have a good evening.” The man reached into his coat and pulled out a pair of sunglasses that looked a lot like Mr. Pennys and just as he was about to place them on his head, I swear I saw a glint of green that did not look natural. He turned and walked away.

When I returned on Monday night, I found that I had a visitor. It was not Mr. Penny, but an ancient, looking man who wore the dirt speckled coveralls of the groundskeeper.

He looked me up and down and scoffed as I entered. I waved to greet him and knew it must be Horus.

He was holding a large bag of salt and I saw several more in the corner.  He scowled, then finally spoke,

“You must be Charlie's replacement. Haven't seen that big bald bastard around but he owes me a pack of cigarettes. Though if you're here it means old Charlie must have made a mistake. Anyway it‘s windy tonight. I brought extra salt. You are going to need it, don't let the line break. I don’t want that light anywhere near the garden or anywhere else where it can get into. Don’t forget or its your ass!” He brushed past me and shot me one last hateful look before departing, slamming the rattling door as he did.

I was shocked and confused, what happened to Charlie? Then I considered the large bald man I had not seen before who delivered my pay. He sounded a lot like this Charlie, but hadn't he been fired? Either way it did not matter, I had to get to work.

I climbed the ladder up to the lookout and after the first thirty minutes the wind whipped up so strongly that the lines of salt began to blow away and several sections were barren. I nearly spat out my coffee and knew I had to get down there quickly.

I rushed back down and grabbed one of the bags of salt Horus had left. It was heavy and I wished I had some way of moving multiple bags, but there was no dolly or truck to do so. I hefted the bag up the hill and opened it, moving to where I had seen the broken section of the ring, and started pouring. As soon as I had finished, I saw more sections required repair. I made several more trips and was getting tired quickly.

I managed to patch all the larger holes in the line, but there was one last segment that had a visible break. I had to stop and catch my breath for a moment. Then I could go get another bag and fix it.

As I sat there and looked at the silent site, I shuddered when I remembered the night where the teens had broken in. I hoped that Mr. Penny had let them go like he said he would. I did not like the way they looked at the strange light or how I had lost the last two hours of my night when I tried to ask him about it.

As I caught my breath, I saw something inexplicable. There was a corona of that green light emerging from the ground near the edge where the break in the line was. I saw a small opossum walk toward the light. It moved in a straight line and did not seem bothered by the fact that I was watching it.

Then I saw the light seemed to stretch out and beyond the ring and reach out to the small animal. The glint of green that reflected in its eyes was terrible, and I stood up and rushed back down the hill to grab another bag and complete the circle again.

When I got back the animal was gone. I could not be sure, but I thought I saw scratch marks on the ground near the ring, like something had tried digging there. I finished the ring and mercifully the wind had died down. As I tried to understand what had just happened, I heard something that froze my heart. I heard the chiming of a bell.

I looked on in horror as one of the gravestone bells was slowly ringing. It was not the wind, it was not any external force. The bell was ringing and I had to act fast. I pressed the SOS button on the radio as I had been instructed and looked at the stone mausoleum nearby.

A morbid part of me wanted to wait and see what was happening. It had to be some trick, it couldn't really be ringing on its own. But I had no time for questions, I remembered Mr. Penny’s warning and went to the mausoleum, searched for the silver key and opened it.

I took one last look outside and confirmed that the small bell was still ringing, before closing the heavy door and locking it again, sealing me off from whatever was happening outside. I expected something at the three-minute mark, but I heard nothing. There was no window so I couldn't see anything, but I swear I saw that damnable green light glowing softly from somewhere near the graves and peaking under the heavy door.

I realized I still had my headset for the directional mic turned on. I had propped the mic on the chair, pointing down at the graves while I moved the salt. When I put the headphones on I heard an odd static. I was not sure what could be making the sounds, but after waiting for almost an hour, I heard something else. It was a consistent scraping, digging sound, followed by a loud crash, like someone hitting wood with metal. I held my breath and after a long moment I thought I heard a voice,

“No, not yet. This one needs more time, they aren't ready. Just a bit more, put them back.”

Then I heard the wooden crash again, followed by more digging. After a while all the sounds had fallen silent. I was left cold and alone, in that dark tomb, terrified, but ultimately oblivious to what had just occurred right outside.

I considered asking Mr. Penny about the bells again, but I did not know if I could trust whatever his answer might be. Whatever was going on at Aurora Ridge, it was getting more concerning by the day.

I spent almost another entire week there, in tense anticipation of something terrible happening. I was getting freaked out and despite the large payday, I was not sure it was smart to keep showing up.

It was Thursday on week three, that the reality of the situation was laid bare, and I saw the thing I could never unsee.

It was a particularly cold night, and I feared the wind would whip the salt off the ring again, or worse I would hear the bells. I was already on edge, when I arrived and when I saw the rain beginning to fall, my mood did not improve. I climbed the ladder to my lookout and struggled to hear anything over the deluge of rain. I paned around with my binoculars and saw the hideous aurora of light emerging and reflecting the water in the air like a disturbing mono colored rainbow.

I wanted to look away but the sight was captivating. I felt myself being drawn into the morbid spectacle and I took an involuntary step forward. I managed to stop myself before I fell over the edge. Something clattered down the roof and smashed into the ground and I realized I had dropped the directional microphone.

I cursed my bad luck but was grateful it had been that and not me that fell over. I looked over at the grave site and saw something surprising. Despite the wind moving the salt the other day, the water from the rain did not seem to be dissolving the ring like I had expected.

I was ready to bolt down and reapply it when I knew the rain was falling, but somehow it had stayed there, unaffected. I tried to distract myself by reading for a while, but I was paranoid by the lack of a microphone. I had gone down to the footlocker to find another but it was empty. There must have only been one. I tried the radio to call for help and get another, but all I got was static.

Since I could not hear anything, I tried to be hyper vigilant with the binoculars and looked around frequently. In another few hours I was getting tired, but was glad the terrible night was almost over. All the coffee I had that night made forced me to take a restroom break. When I got back up the ladder I looked out again, expecting to see nothing but rain splashing off the ground. Instead I saw movement. To my horror, I looked again and saw three of the four bells ringing side to side. I had no idea how long they had been ringing at that point.

I panicked and pressed the SOS button on the radio, Then I half climbed, half slid down the ladder, landing hard at the bottom.

I sprinted up the hill and as soon as I entered the clearing, I saw hellish light bathing the gravestones. The green glow seemed to pulse in time with the maddening chiming of the bells. I rushed to the mausoleum as the storm intensified. As I fumbled for the keys I felt an odd tinge of static that in the next instant made me involuntarily fall back.

I was glad I had leaped back, since in the next instant, a jagged bolt of incandescent green lightning struck near the mausoleum and hit with such tremendous force that a large cracked split a section off the front of the building.

I looked up in a terrible instance and saw the storm had taken on an otherworldly quality that made me dizzy to look at. I picked myself up, opened the door and dove into the mausoleum, closing it behind me.

As I tried to catch my breath after the insane events, I felt a chill and realized something was wrong, the structure was damaged, and I could see through the fractured facade of the mausoleum wall. I could see everything. A large group of hooded figures had appeared, gathered around the gravestone. One wore the distinct sunglasses of Mr. Penny. Others had shovels and were digging at the ground by the gravestones. Piles of dirt were dug up and cast aside, as they moved deeper. I heard three shovels striking wood in unison.

I looked on in numb horror as the green lighting struck the ground around where they had dug up three of the four graves. They bent down in unison and pulled the caskets out of the graves. I was not able to see who or what was in the coffins, but something about the way the reverently stood around them was disturbing.

I heard a ringing sound in my ears and a loud voice spoke out, it was terrible and commanding and I was shocked when I saw it was Mr. Penny who seemed to be speaking in a voice that sounded nothing like his own.

“Bring them forward.”

Two of the hooded figures brought a limp body up towards him and I nearly cried out when I saw the body and recognized the girl. It was Erin, one of the teens who had broken in with her friends to see the light. She was unresponsive, but Mr. Penny reached down and touched her head, then the two robed figured moved her body up toward him and he took off his glasses and I suppressed a horrified gasp as I saw the empty pits that hid underneath, he looked like he should be blind, he had no eyes! Yet he reached out to touch the face of the young girl and a terrible green light filled his hollow eyes and seemed to run down his hands and flow like a terrible river into Erin’s limp body.

Then the eldritch green light flashed, sparked, and a dull rumble was heard, followed by a gasp of air. She was alive, but as her eyes fluttered open, I saw the same inhuman green flame in them as well. They were about to repeat the ritual, when I heard mutterings and one of the robbed figures asked Mr. Penny about the fourth grave.

“He held up a finger and then pointed in my direction at the mausoleum and all I could hear was,

“Soon.”

I huddled down, unable to look at the blasphemous scene any longer. My head started to hurt and there was a ringing in my ears, then I blacked out. When I woke up it was morning. I stole a peek outside and saw that the grave sites were just as they had been before. Undisturbed, even the soil looked unbothered. I started to wonder if it could all have been a terrible nightmare. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, slowly turned around and left.

I drove home in a daze, conscious but bewildered. When I got back I tried to process what I saw that night. I decided to look into Mr.Penny and see if I could find something out about him. When I started looking, I was horrified at my revelation.

There was a V.Penny, the original owner of Aurora Ridge cemetery who had died eighty-five years ago. No known descendants, no family. I remembered the hollow eyes from that night, the green flames burning in his skull and I shuddered.

The terrible revelations continued when I saw on the news that three teens had been declared missing after failing to return home the previous week. When I saw their faces and heard the names announced my heart sank. It was the same three from that night, all of them had been standing right in front of me a little over a week ago.

The implications made me sick when I considered the graves, three of them, three people taken. Three bells ringing out, then the sight of one of them screaming back to life in the hands of Mr. Penny.

I stayed home that night. I could not sleep and the nervous tension made me paranoid. I started writing and someone knocked on my door. It was nearly midnight, and I grabbed a kitchen knife on my way to investigate. I looked out the peephole and nearly gasped aloud when I saw the face of that young girl, Erin. She was just standing there, smiling. I almost reached for the door but as I did she spoke.

“Hello Ben, please remember to call out if you are feeling sick in the future. Don’t forget it’s payday tomorrow. We have something for you back at Aurora Ridge, please come back. It won’t take long and you can finally find a place where you belong. Think of the light, the bell, the last one can be for you. Mr. Penny was right, I can see things now, things I could never see before. You can too.”

She left at some point, and I was alone again. That was last night. I have not left my apartment since then. They keep showing up, beckoning me back to that place where souls return to bath in that monstrous light that claims the living and the dead. In the distance I swear I could hear the fourth bell chiming for me. Calling me to the deepest parts of the earth, to find out the secrets of the chthonic realm of dark stone and death.

The sound is getting louder, but I will try and ignore it tonight. I need to finish this account. If anyone is reading this, do not trust the light, do not listen to the things it brings back and most of all do not listen to Mr. Penny, if he offers you something that is too good to be true.",1,1761717715.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1oiwtrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oiwtrh/i_was_hired_to_watch_the_bells_on_four_graves_in/,I was hired to watch the bells on four graves in a cemetery. They were ringing last night and I think something bad is going to happen.,"My name is Ben, and in case something happens, I need to write down what I saw, or at least think I saw. Whether you believe me or not is up to you. I know what I am about to describe might sound crazy; I would have said it was impossible just a while ago.

I know I should have just walked away when I saw the red flags. I should have listened to my gut. Sometimes, a job is not worth it, regardless of the pay. Now I fear whatever I saw last night could be looking for me this very moment. I should have left the first time I heard the bells.

It started two weeks ago. I had lost my job and was looking for work. It had already been two months at that point since the factory closed and for the first time in years, I was unemployed.

When I was looking for places that were hiring online, I noticed I had received a strange email. It was a work advertisement.

“Now hiring, security personnel for night shift at Aurora Ridge Cemetery. Call for more details, no previous security experience required.”

I was glad to see a potential job prospect had come to me. I never thought to look for security jobs, and definitely not at a place like a cemetery. I decided to call the number listed. The line rang for a minute until someone answered. It was a man with an odd inflection in his voice, like an accent slightly out of time. He was polite though and sounded genuinely happy someone had contacted him about the offer.

“Oh, thank you for the call, my name is Mr. Penny. I'm so glad you are interested in working with us at Aurora Ridge. I would like to arrange a short meeting and introductory tour if you are still interested in the job.” I was thrilled and eagerly responded,

“Yes, thank you Mr. Penny. I would love to, when can we meet?”

“Well tonight at 9:30 pm would work for me, if it works for you.” I paused for a moment, surprised that it would be an interview the same night I had inquired and be so late in the evening. I did not second guess it though, I agreed, and Mr. Penny sounded delighted, almost like I was doing him a favor.

“Oh fantastic, looking forward to seeing you here. Always happy to work with a new soul, take care and see you then.” He hung up and despite how odd the arrangement was, I was happy I might have a paycheck again.

I set out at 9:00pm, leaving a bit of time to get there early, since Aurora Ridge was only a ten-minute drive from my apartment based on the directions.

The place seemed to be nestled out of the way, off the main road leading into town. When I first arrived, I had to double check that I was at the right place. I kept driving a little further on a dirt road and practically into the forest.

When I came upon the main gate I was relieved. A tall iron fence crossed the clearing, and I saw the sign by the main gate and knew I was there. It read,

“Welcome to Aurora Ridge Cemetery, where the light of lives rest eternal.” The gate was closed and when I stepped out of my car I was dismayed when I saw it was locked as well. I guessed I would just have to wait until Mr. Penny was there to let me in.

I waited for a while and when I checked my phone, it was 9:40pm. I was getting worried that I had been tricked and that no one would show up. As I nervously glanced around the area, the light faded further and twilight glowed in the distance. Something about it was odd and made me do a double take. I thought I saw a strange light in the sky. It looked like it was coming from somewhere on the grounds, but further inside the cemetery.

The strange thing was that the light was not in any shade of twilight I had ever seen. It was a sort of green, like one might see in the northern lights. It stood out amongst the other colors and the more I stared at the shifting pattern in the sky, the more unnatural the green light seemed to be. It lingered when the other colors faded away into the darkness of night, like it had a strange phosphorescence.

The odd viewing of the lights was interrupted when I heard a car approaching and I looked and saw a large hearse driving down the road. It pulled up slowly and I could hear the pained grinding of the ancient vehicle, and it lurched to a halt.

A man stepped out of the hearse. He wore a jet black suit and was very tall, but rail thin. Oddly, he also wore a pair of sunglasses that looked glaringly out of place in the dark night. He straightened his jacket and slid a hand back over his thin gray hair. He smiled when he saw me and walked over with a distinct, almost theatrical stride. He reached the gate and unlocked it and he sauntered towards me as the gate yawned open.

“Hello, Ben was it? Pleased to meet you. I trust you found the place alright?” I shook his outstretched hand and he gripped me disturbingly tightly. He kept smiling and shaking until I let go and responded,

“Yes thank you sir, though I was afraid you might not be coming.”

Mr. Penny looked apologetic,

“Yes I know, so sorry for the inconvenience. I had to make a last minute pickup and I was delayed. Though I should give more care to the living, after all the dead can wait.” He chuckled at his own words, like an inside joke. He laughed it off and shrugged,

“Well then shall we?”  He ushered me forward and we stepped in together.

Mr. Penny had insisted we walk, promising that the site was not far. Though as we moved I was struck by just how empty the place seemed to be. Only about a dozen gravestones lay scattered throughout the cemetery. As if reading my mind, Mr. Penny spoke as we walked.

“You might notice the scarcity of graves here. Though our business is new, the lot is ancient. We have more residents here than it appears, but age, degradation and a rather distressing incident have destroyed many of the plots and stones. We still keep the grounds, but leave the other resting places unmarked and undisturbed.”

I thought I saw that odd green light in the distance again before Mr. Penny pointed to a small building we were moving past.

“That is the Groundskeepers building. Old Horus tends the grounds in the day, you might see him on the way out on some nights, but he does not normally stay after dark.”

I nodded my head and we moved up the gentle hill toward a larger building in the distance. The green glow was gone and I started to wonder if I had really seen it at all.

Mr. Penny spoke up again and pointed to the building,

“Here we are, please follow me if you would. The station is here and we will discuss the job further, but the sight that really matters is just a short way further up the hill. We will get to that and more, assuming you agree to take the position.” He smiled awkwardly and I was confused by the comment. I thought I was guarding the entire cemetery. What was this other site?

The security station came into clearer view as we moved closer, and I saw it had a strange, almost tower like lookout that jutted out of the roof, giving it the impression of a lighthouse looking out over a vast ocean of the buried dead.

We walked up to the door and he fumbled with a large ring of keys. He glanced at me apologetically as he tried a few to no effect. Finally, the door opened on rusty hinges, and he held out a hand to invite me in.

We walked inside and I saw it resembled a sparse cabin. Barely any furniture, besides a table, chair and a small footlocker. It was not what I had expected, I thought there might at least be a monitor and some security cameras. Near the corner I saw the only other door and a ladder that must lead to the odd lookout tower.

The door closed behind us and it focused my attention back on Mr. Penny.

“Well then, please take a chair, don’t worry I'll stand, seeing as how there is not an abundance of chairs.” He chuckled halfheartedly, and I smiled slightly to not disappoint his attempt at humor.

“Here at Aurora Ridge, we value hard work and integrity. But we need to know we can trust you to do your best and not let base fears get in the way of your contributions. So, I must ask, are you afraid of the dead and their resting places?” I was taken off guard by the question, but I guessed it must be some sort of interview he was doing first so I answered honestly,

“No, I’m not afraid of the dead or cemeteries sir.”

He smiled at my answer,

“Good, very good. Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?”

I replied, “No.” Once again. Mr. Penny nodded his head and continued,

“Good. You see many employees have left this job in the past. It is not for the faint of heart. I know it seems straightforward, just guarding the grounds at night. But alone and in the dark....”He paused, while fixing his stare on me and adjusting his sunglasses, but not taking them off.

“Well people forget themselves, start to see things. The mind gets tired, fantastical stories start becoming believable, and even skeptics can start to believe absurd things. So, I assure you, if you follow the rules and do not give in to crazy musings, you will do well.” His smile was back and I was wondering how many people had this job before.

“Speaking of doing well, we pay well for this position. The stress it puts on the mind can be harrowing, and we like to offer our night guardsmen something akin to hazard pay. Therefore, we are willing to offer a salary of $3000 a week.”

My jaw almost hit the floor when I heard how much it paid. I had no idea what sort of security job paid that much, but I was stunned by the offer.

“I see I have your attention, good. I will take that as a yes then?”

I was already nodding my head eagerly, before he had even gotten into the particulars of the job.

“Good very good, he smiled and held out his hand.” I shook it without even thinking to ask why the pay was so significant and why he had called it “Hazard pay”

“Well then, please if you would, follow me. We have a special place to visit, and I need you to listen closely. The instructions are paramount to your success. I nodded my head and opened a note app on my phone.

Mr. Penny led the way on a small path, lit only by the dim light of a small row of solar stake lamps. We ascended the hill and the path led into what looked like a thicket. Mr. Penny walked on, unbothered, and gestured me to follow.

The small drape of plant life brushed away easily, and a somewhat concealed glen rested beyond. The area was hauntingly beautiful. Flowers grew around the soft green grass, and fireflies danced around a small tree near the center. The pretty ambiance distracted from the other key features in this tiny clearing.

Near the center of the glen, were four evenly spaced gravestones. They were fairly large but not imposing. And each one had a small string hanging above them, connected to tiny bells. I thought it was odd, grave bells were not used anymore, since modern medical science had long since determined a way to verify if someone was truly deceased. Beyond the four graves was a small, but intricately detailed mausoleum.

The sight of all the scenery was jarring. I took another step toward the surreal resting place. Suddenly Mr. Penny grabbed my shoulder, holding me back momentarily. He was looking at me as if appraising my reaction.

“Beautiful isn't it? An oasis of calm, separate from the drudgery of life. Your first and most important job is keeping this place safe. I know you have many questions, but I am going to explain the most important expectations regarding security here at Aurora Ridge. Failure to comply with them will result in .... consequences, understood?” I nodded my head at his sudden change of tone,

“Good, very good. I will be sure to remind you of that commitment. In fact your predecessor had to be terminated for failing to follow protocol. So if you wish to remain, you will listen carefully.""

He sounded serious and I nodded my head and listened to the instructions.

“Your work hours will be 10:00pm to 6:00am. You are not to leave until 6:00am unless expressly authorized.”

“Breaks can be taken within reason, but you may not leave the grounds during breaks. You must stay at your post. Lunch's must be brought in with you, no delivery services of course.”

“Bathroom breaks are of course permitted, but time should be strictly monitored. Sound systems should continue to be verified even during restroom breaks to ensure fast response should something happen.”

“You are not to disturb the grounds directly, no going past or disturbing this line. Especially no going near the graves.”

I looked to where he was pointing and it was the small white line that seemed to stretch on to the left and right. My foot had almost crossed it and I realized that was why Mr. Penny had stopped me. At first it looked like it was drawn on like a football field, but I noticed when I looked closer it seemed to be made of salt.

Mr. Penny waited until I looked back up at him and continued.

“Absolutely no trespassers. We are closed at night. Any and all trespassers must be detained and dealt with. There is a channel on the radio that you must call if intruders are detected, channel six. Your job is observation, other security personnel will detain them, prior to removal by law enforcement, understood? ”

I nodded my head again and he moved on,

“Sometimes external influences can disrupt the lines of demarcation, if this occurs, please re-apply the security salt to ensure the ring stays whole at all times.”

“This last rule is critical; you must abide. Are you paying attention?” He asked sharply. I nodded my head and confirmed.

“If the graveyard bells ring, even if it is just one. You are to press the SOS  button on your radio to signal the event. Then you must evacuate immediately. You will have exactly three minutes to make your way up the hill and to the mausoleum outside the ring. Then you are to use this key and enter the mausoleum, close the door and wait until morning, no earlier than 6:00am. Do you understand?”

It was the strangest request so far; I had no idea why the bells would ring. Unless someone was buried alive....

I couldn't help but ask after that one,

“But sir why would they...” Mr. Penny cut me off,

“They almost never do, but strange things can happen here. Even if you think it is just the wind, it's better to be safe than sorry. Go to the mausoleum, lock up and stay put. Any interaction with the bells after they ring, even waiting to watch what happens after the first three minutes will be..... a problem. Nothing will happen to you if you follow the rules, understand?”

I was concerned and very skeptical, but I was more desperate to have a paycheck again. I figured I would follow whatever superstitious rules I was given if it meant not being broke anymore. I nodded my head and agreed,

“Yes.”

Mr. Penny beamed at my response,

“Excellent, well then if that's all settled I will show you to the tower. We have the watch tower there to keep a safe eye on the place while keeping a respectful distance. There are night vision binoculars, a directional microphone, and a radio there. Along with spare batteries for the lot back in the security building. The station also has a small restroom which we have stored some extra salt in as well, should you need to reapply it.”

He led me back to the building and I stepped inside. I saw the small footlocker that he mentioned the devices were in. When I turned back and saw Mr. Penny was not coming inside, he did an about face and smiled,

“Oh I’m sorry, I forgot to mention, I need you to start tonight, I hope that's alright?” I was surprised, but felt like I couldn't say no without jeopardizing the opportunity, so I reluctantly agreed,

“Yeah, I mean yes of course.”

“Fantastic, I knew I was right about you, take care and keep your eyes peeled and ears open. Have a good night my friend.”

He closed the door and just like that I was alone at my new job, watching over a small grave site for an absurd salary and following a bizarre list of rules.

I looked around again briefly and realized I should probably head up the small tower and take a look from my vantage. It sounded like I was going to spend most of my nights there.

I opened the footlocker near the ladder and removed a surprisingly nice and expensive looking pair of night vision binoculars. I switched it on and the battery charge was full. There was also a small directional microphone, which had a wireless headset it connected to. I also grabbed the handheld radio and switched it on. I stowed the items and climbed the ladder to the lonesome tower.

I saw a folding chair set aside in the lookout and was grateful that I was not expected to stand there for hours on end. Though I regretted not bringing something to help pass the time. I had not expected to work that night, but with the knowledge of the payday I had in store, a few boring hours watching some graves was nothing.

I grabbed the small chair, unfolded it and set it up so it would be facing toward the hill I had to watch. When I sat down, I saw that I had a good view of the surroundings acres of grounds. It was all positioned just right to see directly into the little glen that housed my charge.

While looking closer with the binoculars, I noticed something odd. None of the four special gravestones had any names, or any markings on them. They were all blank. I found it strange, but once again I did not question my fortune in guarding them.

After an hour and a half, my eyes started to get tired constantly looking out at the site. The perimeter ring was undisturbed; nothing was moving about. Barely even a breeze to disturb the dead silence of it all. I switched over to the directional microphone and pointed it at the site to confirm.

As I had expected there was nothing, at first. Then I thought I heard a low groaning, creaking sound. It was odd, but not too concerning. After a while I started hearing another sound, like a persistent scratching and tapping.

It continued for half an hour and I was about to go investigate. Then it suddenly stopped just as I was about to go back down. I managed to make it through the rest of the night with no further issues.

Almost the entire first week was uneventful, but on Friday, something happened.

I had a routine prepared for the long haul, including snacks and entertainment to pass the time while staying focused on my objective. I couldn't listen to anything since I had to keep an ear out for the bells on the microphone, but I was able to steal a few moments of time to read a book. I wanted to use my phone, but reception was bad so it was a nonstarter.

I made it through almost the entire night and was so engrossed by the book I was reading that I did not pick up on the sounds coming through the mic at first. It took me a second to realize I was hearing voices coming from the tree line. I propped the mic up so I could still hear and grabbed the binoculars. I looked out at the graves and did not see anything at first. Then I saw rustling in the foliage near the mausoleum and three figures emerged. I had to do something, they were heading for the site. I heard the voices speaking clearer as I trained the mic directly on them,

“How did we even get this far Erin? And what light are you talking about? It is too dark to see anything out here.” The first voice spoke, sounding like a young man. Another responded to the question curtly,

“I know what I saw Jess, there was a weird green light, it was coming from here, it didn't look natural.”

“Guys we shouldn't be here, this place, there's something not right about it.” Another voice spoke up, meek and concerned. She was right about one thing they shouldn't be there. I had to figure out what to do.

I remembered the instructions and switched on the radio to channel six.

“This is Ben, in the tower. There are three trespassers by the site, going down now to investigate.” There was no response, so I just moved on, grabbing my flashlight and rushing downstairs.

I sprinted toward the glen and made it through just in time to see the three strangers stepping over and disrupting the salt line. They all looked fairly young, two girls and a boy, probably in their teens. I shouted out a warning,

“Stop! This is private property!” Two of them held up their hands, even though it was only a flashlight I was holding. The third looked at me with a mixture of confusion and fascination.

“What is this place?” The girl had asked, sounding like she was speaking while in a dream.

The other two looked scared and confused. I spoke again, slightly softer than before.

“This is private property and a graveyard satisfied? Now clear off. You are not supposed to be here.” I tried to sound commanding, but not overly hostile.

Her two friends shrunk back, clearly not wanting to get in trouble, but she stepped forward and asked me a surprising question,

“I came for the light; did you see it too? There was something in it, it called me here.” I shined my flashlight on her and her expression looked oddly distant. The mention of the light was weird. I remembered the green light I had seen the first day. Maybe this group had seen it too? I felt guilty for detaining them, but knew I had to get them to leave. I lowered my hands, and tried to get them to listen.

“I’m not sure what light you think called you here, but you all should get back home, it is late and you look like high schoolers. Your parents must be worried. Do you live close?”

The girl in the middle, Erin as I had heard her friends call her, offered an odd response.

“I... don’t know. I can't remember?” She sounded scared suddenly. The other two looked at her and then at each other. I shined the light on them again and I saw their eyes were glassy. I thought they might have taken some psychedelics or something, since they did not seem to be all there. Then when I looked closer, I saw a hint of unnatural green light reflecting off their eyes.

The effect was eerie, and I decided to lead them out of there. I hoped they had a number I could call to have their parents pick them up. I explained my plan to them and they agreed.

“Yeah....yeah lets go, I think it was a mistake coming here. Somethings wrong with this place, I don’t like it.” The boy said as if waking up from a dream. The girls nodded and suddenly looked more lucid than when they had arrived. I was relieved and started ushering them out.

But before I could show the way back, I was startled when I heard a loudspeaker demanding that the group,

“Freeze!” It was two large men in riot style security gear. I did not know why they were there, but then I remembered the radio call. I tried to explain the situation, but the two men brushed past me and seized two of the teenagers roughly. I tried to protest, but one of them knocked me down in the pursuit and I fell hard.

Erin had tried to get away, even while her friends had been seized, but as she reached the tree line, a third figure grabbed her. It was Mr. Penny. The teens protested and struggled, and I did not like the force that the others were using to detain them. Before I could voice my concern, Mr. Penny spoke.

“Very good Ben, nice work. Looks like we got here before they could do any damage. We will escort them off the premises, after some community service.” I replied, trying to see if I could help.

“Thank you, sir. Though they don't seem like they came here to cause trouble, maybe we can let them go without involving the police?”

Mr. Penny chuckled then responded.

“Oh they should be so lucky, no we will let them go, after they re-salt the circle. Then we will put them back where they belong. But you must not concern yourself, since we are here and will be repairing the damage, you are free to go for the last few hours. Go home and get some sleep, I will handle it from here.”

I did not like the situation. I looked at the teens and they were not shouting or protesting; they just seemed to be staring at the graves, like they were in a trance. I thought I saw the weird light emerging from the ground for a split second before it was gone.

Then I saw the two men in riot gear holding large bags of salt. It looked like one of them was moving tools and I thought I saw a shovel in his hands.

My heartbeat quickened and I was getting nervous about what was happening. But as I was about to protest going home, Mr. Penny stood up and walked over to me. He put an arm on my shoulder and turned me around to face him directly, I saw he was holding his sunglasses in his hand and I realized it was the first time I had seen him take them off.

“Don’t work too hard. Just go home...now.”

I remembered looking up and facing him. After that I don’t remember what I saw.

The next thing I knew it was 6:15am. I was asleep in my car, parked just outside my apartment. I had no recollection of how I got back. Somehow, I had left, driven home and fell asleep in my car in those last two hours.

Something was seriously wrong, but I had no way of explaining just what it was.  I had wanted to talk to Mr. Penny about the strange experience, but he was absent for most of the next week. I grew more nervous about what had happened, but I kept going back. I did not like it, but felt like I had no choice.

That weekend I had another strange experience. Someone was knocking on my apartment door that Saturday night. When I answered it, I saw a large bald man standing there.  He stared at me for a moment before doing anything, then pulled out a small manilla folder and handed it to me. I was confused, but when I looked, I saw it had $3000 in cash stuffed inside. The large man spoke, in a dull monotone voice,

“Aurora Ridge thanks you for your work, have a good evening.” The man reached into his coat and pulled out a pair of sunglasses that looked a lot like Mr. Pennys and just as he was about to place them on his head, I swear I saw a glint of green that did not look natural. He turned and walked away.

When I returned on Monday night, I found that I had a visitor. It was not Mr. Penny, but an ancient, looking man who wore the dirt speckled coveralls of the groundskeeper.

He looked me up and down and scoffed as I entered. I waved to greet him and knew it must be Horus.

He was holding a large bag of salt and I saw several more in the corner.  He scowled, then finally spoke,

“You must be Charlie's replacement. Haven't seen that big bald bastard around but he owes me a pack of cigarettes. Though if you're here it means old Charlie must have made a mistake. Anyway it‘s windy tonight. I brought extra salt. You are going to need it, don't let the line break. I don’t want that light anywhere near the garden or anywhere else where it can get into. Don’t forget or its your ass!” He brushed past me and shot me one last hateful look before departing, slamming the rattling door as he did.

I was shocked and confused, what happened to Charlie? Then I considered the large bald man I had not seen before who delivered my pay. He sounded a lot like this Charlie, but hadn't he been fired? Either way it did not matter, I had to get to work.

I climbed the ladder up to the lookout and after the first thirty minutes the wind whipped up so strongly that the lines of salt began to blow away and several sections were barren. I nearly spat out my coffee and knew I had to get down there quickly.

I rushed back down and grabbed one of the bags of salt Horus had left. It was heavy and I wished I had some way of moving multiple bags, but there was no dolly or truck to do so. I hefted the bag up the hill and opened it, moving to where I had seen the broken section of the ring, and started pouring. As soon as I had finished, I saw more sections required repair. I made several more trips and was getting tired quickly.

I managed to patch all the larger holes in the line, but there was one last segment that had a visible break. I had to stop and catch my breath for a moment. Then I could go get another bag and fix it.

As I sat there and looked at the silent site, I shuddered when I remembered the night where the teens had broken in. I hoped that Mr. Penny had let them go like he said he would. I did not like the way they looked at the strange light or how I had lost the last two hours of my night when I tried to ask him about it.

As I caught my breath, I saw something inexplicable. There was a corona of that green light emerging from the ground near the edge where the break in the line was. I saw a small opossum walk toward the light. It moved in a straight line and did not seem bothered by the fact that I was watching it.

Then I saw the light seemed to stretch out and beyond the ring and reach out to the small animal. The glint of green that reflected in its eyes was terrible, and I stood up and rushed back down the hill to grab another bag and complete the circle again.

When I got back the animal was gone. I could not be sure, but I thought I saw scratch marks on the ground near the ring, like something had tried digging there. I finished the ring and mercifully the wind had died down. As I tried to understand what had just happened, I heard something that froze my heart. I heard the chiming of a bell.

I looked on in horror as one of the gravestone bells was slowly ringing. It was not the wind, it was not any external force. The bell was ringing and I had to act fast. I pressed the SOS button on the radio as I had been instructed and looked at the stone mausoleum nearby.

A morbid part of me wanted to wait and see what was happening. It had to be some trick, it couldn't really be ringing on its own. But I had no time for questions, I remembered Mr. Penny’s warning and went to the mausoleum, searched for the silver key and opened it.

I took one last look outside and confirmed that the small bell was still ringing, before closing the heavy door and locking it again, sealing me off from whatever was happening outside. I expected something at the three-minute mark, but I heard nothing. There was no window so I couldn't see anything, but I swear I saw that damnable green light glowing softly from somewhere near the graves and peaking under the heavy door.

I realized I still had my headset for the directional mic turned on. I had propped the mic on the chair, pointing down at the graves while I moved the salt. When I put the headphones on I heard an odd static. I was not sure what could be making the sounds, but after waiting for almost an hour, I heard something else. It was a consistent scraping, digging sound, followed by a loud crash, like someone hitting wood with metal. I held my breath and after a long moment I thought I heard a voice,

“No, not yet. This one needs more time, they aren't ready. Just a bit more, put them back.”

Then I heard the wooden crash again, followed by more digging. After a while all the sounds had fallen silent. I was left cold and alone, in that dark tomb, terrified, but ultimately oblivious to what had just occurred right outside.

I considered asking Mr. Penny about the bells again, but I did not know if I could trust whatever his answer might be. Whatever was going on at Aurora Ridge, it was getting more concerning by the day.

I spent almost another entire week there, in tense anticipation of something terrible happening. I was getting freaked out and despite the large payday, I was not sure it was smart to keep showing up.

It was Thursday on week three, that the reality of the situation was laid bare, and I saw the thing I could never unsee.

It was a particularly cold night, and I feared the wind would whip the salt off the ring again, or worse I would hear the bells. I was already on edge, when I arrived and when I saw the rain beginning to fall, my mood did not improve. I climbed the ladder to my lookout and struggled to hear anything over the deluge of rain. I paned around with my binoculars and saw the hideous aurora of light emerging and reflecting the water in the air like a disturbing mono colored rainbow.

I wanted to look away but the sight was captivating. I felt myself being drawn into the morbid spectacle and I took an involuntary step forward. I managed to stop myself before I fell over the edge. Something clattered down the roof and smashed into the ground and I realized I had dropped the directional microphone.

I cursed my bad luck but was grateful it had been that and not me that fell over. I looked over at the grave site and saw something surprising. Despite the wind moving the salt the other day, the water from the rain did not seem to be dissolving the ring like I had expected.

I was ready to bolt down and reapply it when I knew the rain was falling, but somehow it had stayed there, unaffected. I tried to distract myself by reading for a while, but I was paranoid by the lack of a microphone. I had gone down to the footlocker to find another but it was empty. There must have only been one. I tried the radio to call for help and get another, but all I got was static.

Since I could not hear anything, I tried to be hyper vigilant with the binoculars and looked around frequently. In another few hours I was getting tired, but was glad the terrible night was almost over. All the coffee I had that night made forced me to take a restroom break. When I got back up the ladder I looked out again, expecting to see nothing but rain splashing off the ground. Instead I saw movement. To my horror, I looked again and saw three of the four bells ringing side to side. I had no idea how long they had been ringing at that point.

I panicked and pressed the SOS button on the radio, Then I half climbed, half slid down the ladder, landing hard at the bottom.

I sprinted up the hill and as soon as I entered the clearing, I saw hellish light bathing the gravestones. The green glow seemed to pulse in time with the maddening chiming of the bells. I rushed to the mausoleum as the storm intensified. As I fumbled for the keys I felt an odd tinge of static that in the next instant made me involuntarily fall back.

I was glad I had leaped back, since in the next instant, a jagged bolt of incandescent green lightning struck near the mausoleum and hit with such tremendous force that a large cracked split a section off the front of the building.

I looked up in a terrible instance and saw the storm had taken on an otherworldly quality that made me dizzy to look at. I picked myself up, opened the door and dove into the mausoleum, closing it behind me.

As I tried to catch my breath after the insane events, I felt a chill and realized something was wrong, the structure was damaged, and I could see through the fractured facade of the mausoleum wall. I could see everything. A large group of hooded figures had appeared, gathered around the gravestone. One wore the distinct sunglasses of Mr. Penny. Others had shovels and were digging at the ground by the gravestones. Piles of dirt were dug up and cast aside, as they moved deeper. I heard three shovels striking wood in unison.

I looked on in numb horror as the green lighting struck the ground around where they had dug up three of the four graves. They bent down in unison and pulled the caskets out of the graves. I was not able to see who or what was in the coffins, but something about the way the reverently stood around them was disturbing.

I heard a ringing sound in my ears and a loud voice spoke out, it was terrible and commanding and I was shocked when I saw it was Mr. Penny who seemed to be speaking in a voice that sounded nothing like his own.

“Bring them forward.”

Two of the hooded figures brought a limp body up towards him and I nearly cried out when I saw the body and recognized the girl. It was Erin, one of the teens who had broken in with her friends to see the light. She was unresponsive, but Mr. Penny reached down and touched her head, then the two robed figured moved her body up toward him and he took off his glasses and I suppressed a horrified gasp as I saw the empty pits that hid underneath, he looked like he should be blind, he had no eyes! Yet he reached out to touch the face of the young girl and a terrible green light filled his hollow eyes and seemed to run down his hands and flow like a terrible river into Erin’s limp body.

Then the eldritch green light flashed, sparked, and a dull rumble was heard, followed by a gasp of air. She was alive, but as her eyes fluttered open, I saw the same inhuman green flame in them as well. They were about to repeat the ritual, when I heard mutterings and one of the robbed figures asked Mr. Penny about the fourth grave.

“He held up a finger and then pointed in my direction at the mausoleum and all I could hear was,

“Soon.”

I huddled down, unable to look at the blasphemous scene any longer. My head started to hurt and there was a ringing in my ears, then I blacked out. When I woke up it was morning. I stole a peek outside and saw that the grave sites were just as they had been before. Undisturbed, even the soil looked unbothered. I started to wonder if it could all have been a terrible nightmare. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, slowly turned around and left.

I drove home in a daze, conscious but bewildered. When I got back I tried to process what I saw that night. I decided to look into Mr.Penny and see if I could find something out about him. When I started looking, I was horrified at my revelation.

There was a V.Penny, the original owner of Aurora Ridge cemetery who had died eighty-five years ago. No known descendants, no family. I remembered the hollow eyes from that night, the green flames burning in his skull and I shuddered.

The terrible revelations continued when I saw on the news that three teens had been declared missing after failing to return home the previous week. When I saw their faces and heard the names announced my heart sank. It was the same three from that night, all of them had been standing right in front of me a little over a week ago.

The implications made me sick when I considered the graves, three of them, three people taken. Three bells ringing out, then the sight of one of them screaming back to life in the hands of Mr. Penny.

I stayed home that night. I could not sleep and the nervous tension made me paranoid. I started writing and someone knocked on my door. It was nearly midnight, and I grabbed a kitchen knife on my way to investigate. I looked out the peephole and nearly gasped aloud when I saw the face of that young girl, Erin. She was just standing there, smiling. I almost reached for the door but as I did she spoke.

“Hello Ben, please remember to call out if you are feeling sick in the future. Don’t forget it’s payday tomorrow. We have something for you back at Aurora Ridge, please come back. It won’t take long and you can finally find a place where you belong. Think of the light, the bell, the last one can be for you. Mr. Penny was right, I can see things now, things I could never see before. You can too.”

She left at some point, and I was alone again. That was last night. I have not left my apartment since then. They keep showing up, beckoning me back to that place where souls return to bath in that monstrous light that claims the living and the dead. In the distance I swear I could hear the fourth bell chiming for me. Calling me to the deepest parts of the earth, to find out the secrets of the chthonic realm of dark stone and death.

The sound is getting louder, but I will try and ignore it tonight. I need to finish this account. If anyone is reading this, do not trust the light, do not listen to the things it brings back and most of all do not listen to Mr. Penny, if he offers you something that is too good to be true.",1,1761717645.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1oiwtl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oiwtl5/i_23m_am_not_really_sure_how_to_proceed/,I [23M] am not really sure how to proceed intimately with a girl [23F] i am dating and I have no one to talk to about it,"My mom, dad, sisters, and brother all do not want to help me with this because they have said they do not care to know about my sex life (TMI thing, I guess) and I haven't been able to get advice from my friends because they do not and have not dated women (so they tell me ""i dont know what to tell you"").

I have been dating a girl for about 2.5 months or so, we've been on 4 dates in total. I've known her since January of this year. I know her well and we've expressed our mutual feelings towards one another recently and how we want to continue seeing each other and work towards a more serious relationship. Problem is that right now we are both in school and super busy, I hardly see her during the week and we are at the point in the year where we have no time for each other. I have seen her maybe once in the last 2 weeks and it was a conversation in passing for maybe 5 minutes.

Regardless, the last time I was with her for an evening we spoke about sex and intimacy. I am not someone who jumps on sex immediately so at the moment I was hesitant, to which she said that when I am ready to tell her. We did kiss that night, but apart from that it was it. We've spoken either over text almost every day or the few seconds that I do see her throughout the week.

Thing is, and I do not know why this is (probably because i am really attracted to her), but lately I have felt that I am ready for more intimacy. I would really like to have sex with her (or even just be more intimate), but I am not sure how to move forward on it.

a) I have felt at times that she is not interested and that asking would be a bad idea. We both want a fairly slow start to a relationship (if thats what we can even call it) and I am worried that sex would be a big leap. I have learned a bit more recently that sex isn't as big of a leap for people as it is for me. I was raised in a pretty modest household and sex to me was a very important leap. I do not know how to orchestrate it into words, so sorry if this is confusing. She has recently been more and more flirty so I feel like she is still interested but I really have no clue. Especially when it comes to sexual advances I do not take chances, I have to be told explicitly what the other person wants. My first question is how do I feel out the situation? We are both mature adults so I am learning towards just asking straightforward, but I am not sure if that is the most mature way.

b) On the same beat, she literally told me to tell her when I am ready. I have also felt that me not asking has been a bit of a disservice. She has made a few moves on me that I later realized were perhaps ""nudging"" me (think george costanza not going upstairs for coffee because it was late). Asking for something like this over text to someone I haven't been with that long is, to me, the worst thing imaginable. I know for certain I will see her at a party on Saturday but I also know that we will both be drinking pretty heavily so I can't imagine me asking her while we are both drunk is smart. Also I would like the first time to be somewhat special or meaningful. But this is again the next time I know I will see her for who knows how long. So, is it a good idea to make a move at this party?

c) Is it even a good idea in the first place? It's not that sex is taboo to me, but rather that I do not want to / know how to ask in a way that wouldn't make me come off as desperate or a creep. Moreover, I do not want to make a mistake this early on in our relationship. I really do like her and I know the slow burn we have going on now will pay off big time, so the last thing I would want to do is blow it up now. How do I ask this person if they would like to have sex in a respectful way while also respecting the pace we are at?

TLDR: Girl I am dating told me to tell her that when I am ready to have sex. No one close to me is willing or able to give advice. We are taking our ""relationship"" slow so I am not sure how to ask without jeopardizing anything. I do not really see her often at the moment because of our school schedules but she has made comments as of recent that might be indicating her wanting sex, but I am not sure how to still read the situation entirely.",1,1761717627.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

""There is a fundamental reality which is not perceptual. That is more fundamental. That is the origin of space, time, energy, information, matter. That differentiates into everything that we call reality. And we are a part of it.

The wandering mystic, pondering gypsy, calmly sipping on coffee dipped whiskey, ayahuasca. Copy this, I spit this from the farthest regions. Begotten from Martian speeches. Astral travel through the mind's mazes. Sublime gaze are timeless and amazing. I align with the sages of Mayan sages. Coptic sun etched on my neck. Opposite reflection of my goddess's precious name. A full moon waxing and waning. Mother maiden and crone. The goddess is three stages. The topics I breathe are ageless. They bloom like the facts of my pages.

Brothers are swayed by my tones. My odysseys breed angels. I see strangers in my omens. My dreams gaze in unknown phases of existence. I stray in the distance like the artist's vagabonds. Play with the misfits in these subconscious catacombs. Opium den visions when I sleep. I hope for the men missing their reason. I'm gifted this season. But who knows in the next. My flows's best my foes with blessed poses. But those that have vexed hex my totem. I'm a wolverine trickster. Don't follow me. I got wolves in my team. Sicker than sorrow and grief.

And the wool, the seamstress trips and pulls over your eyes

Sobering lies, but I know they're disguise

I grow till the scars collapse

And the atlas is but a fragment

A nano-fraction of an atom

My hands are immensity, so immense

In fact, I could slap you from this density

Or get mad if you pester me

I'm like Nephilim giants

I bested men and tyrants and left them with gems dying

I hemmed iron prophecies while they reveled in gold

And demons embezzled their souls

The pressure and the cold

I've withstood our colossal

I split wood with apostles

To feed the goddesses hearth

I've been odd since birth

A watcher with sick curses

So I topple them in spit verses

With bliss till I'm gifted with purpose

I meditate while I write

Battle many hatreds in spite

And levitate in the night till I make it to the light

You couldn't fathom what I've seen

If you basked in my dreams

You'd have massive spleen

Like French poets, immense gross of melancholy

I'm zen but I poly with rosters and First Nations prophets

Like Raven and Ashari

Spar with me we slay your optics first

I'm the Coptic church

Before it lost its virtue I curse you but my Boss won't hurt you

They disperse cruels and rebirth fools Then I nurse them with the earth's jewels

Then I nurse them with the earth's jewels

I'll travel to depths and space if it'll bring change

Evolve to the next stage, prevent the next plague

Unravel the cosmos if there's a means to save

And aim to refrain and rephrase all there is to say

If you say that you'll stay, then it's your obligation

To trove the dark matter with no hesitation Rearrange thought patterns in a successive order

Preordain the Jewetic Hatter Madness in a predictive order

And drop in a cusp beam Let's call it a trust state

Fly blindly into a novus gleam Supreme being chaperone, beliefs seeing flatters your own greatness

Feeling beauty in the weightless, fatheless skeptics, mateless septics

Can't understand feeling whole in a world full of hate Yes, let's return to the essence of the universe

Galactic space journeys, blessings of the beauty's current

Beauties burst with obligations To gather concentration into one sheet energy burst

One punch type frustration A right bust nation

Ready to pop off with one dirty look Swallowed up with dirty crooks

A prison system with a vision But on the planet we all booked

Until we self-love, we all shook All men stuck their right into nowhere

The yellow brick to Oz The fellas flick the claws

Only they realize their loss Take a pause to applause

Others living, greedy, too selfish to recognize Others giving,

Bleeding, greedy, isn't enough We must engage and learn to follow through

I'll touch the page if you can swallow proof It's a horse pill with Norse will and coarse throats

No frills or lacy things I give the raw truth

Get chills when I lace with kings I get filled when I taste the steams

Throw in texts with eight verses They understand and reciprocate

Grow in sense of real purpose Raise your hand and discuss, participate

Raise a family, trust, invigorate Spread the seed of knowledge, rounds and smash, obliterate

Any and all evil doers into a billion particle pieces As they weave in sewers

Camelians in my article thesis I'm the audible priestess

Preaching to an audience speechless Peace blessed

He's a wretched to travel to Astro Trek Inspired a massive mind flexed

Rhyme sex for the mindless Climb text for the timeless

Raps the masses from the floor to the opulent Get bent, send it off like we always do

Heads us off when we run the room Kalki and I stun the moon when the pen hits

Kaboom You know we make a move on this plane to the next

Time to travel and travel the space beyond the deck Jump through portals just to save what's left

Jump through portals just to save what's left.""",2,1761717441.0,obscuremusic,0,1.0,False

Our very most important ground rules: 1. we talk to each other before making plans with other people. 2. We don’t see other people when we’re not in a good place with each other. 

This afternoon my partner asked if I would be okay if he was ‘an hour or so late’. He goes out for coffee after work with his friends pretty often, so I didn’t think anything of it. Until he texted me 2.5 hours after he got out of work to let me know that he was on his way home- he was JUST leaving and was still over an hour away. 

He couldn’t figure out why I was upset, but I STILL don’t know where he was or what he was doing. But judging by his lack of response and the side stepping, he was with someone else. He brought up the fact that I came home late the other night but: I let him know I was running late, AND he knew where I was, who I was with, and what I was doing before I ever left the house. He then told me if I wanted to know I should have asked. 

I’m pretty salty. 

Am I wrong here, or should he have been open when he texted me initially?

I’m 28F. Up until about last year, I had no reason to complain about my social life — my inboxes were always full of messages, I got invited out for drinks, concerts, trips. Something has been going wrong with me since around last winter. I gained weight, from a size S to an L. I don’t look terrible — I’m tall and fairly proportionate (people tell me I’m being silly when I say I’m 'fat'), but the scale and the need for a new wardrobe tell a different story. I’ve started working on it, but I have a feeling that the weight gain coincided with the worsening of my social problems, and that it’s somehow connected. I don’t mean that people my size can’t be liked — I just suspect that not feeling comfortable in my own body might be off-putting. Other than the weight issue, I’m generally well-groomed and considered somehow pretty though I don’t really believe it myself and I’m rather shy.

Recently I started losing touch with people — both men and women. At this point, from a dozen of close friends, I only regularly talk to my sister and one long-time friend. I don’t want to go into too much detail because I’d rather stay anonymous, but I work in a very specific field where I meet new people practically every day, and every day I see how others make friends, spend time together — and nobody seems interested in me. People stopped texting me. I don’t get invited anywhere. At work training sessions, I have no one to sit next to because I don’t talk to anyone. It’s not like people dislike me or gossip about me — I’m just invisible. Someone asks me why I didn’t show up to a work barbecue yesterday, I say I didn’t know about it because I wasn’t invited, and they respond, 'What do you mean, everyone was invited'. I keep hearing stories about how people went somewhere together, had lunch, went on a trip. When I try to start conversations or make plans, I just get polite replies like 'yeah, we should grab a coffee sometime' and then they disappear.

Right now I’m actually at a training session with a larger group — most of us know each other at least a bit. I was standing with a female and a male colleague, people came over to say hi before the session — with them, it’s hugs, cheek kisses, 'oh my god, I’m so happy to see you', and with me it’s just a smile and a Hi. I swear I’m starting to feel like a leper. I even asked my colleagues if they’d heard any gossip about me, and they said never, that I was being crazy about it. But I can see with my own eyes that when we’re standing in a group, people talk to them, not to me. I can’t be imagining that…

And I want to emphasize this — I’m a cheerful person. I laugh a lot, I joke around, and honestly, until about a year ago I had no trouble making friends. It’s like someone flipped a switch and suddenly everything changed. About two weeks ago I decided to take matters into my own hands and messaged a few closer friends — the conversations died after maybe five messages, and none of them have written since. It’s not like I suddenly decided to reach out after ages — no, we used to talk regularly and make plans, both sides initiated contact. Then, suddenly, total silence.

The last straw was yesterday. I’m still at that training, and I met up with the two colleagues I mentioned earlier. We’re good friends, but we live in different cities and hadn’t seen each other since that fateful December. The guy is gay, so there were no 'romantic intentions' involved that could explain it. We watched a movie together and chatted a bit. When the movie ended, I said it was time for me to go, started gathering my things. They were both on their phones, completely ignoring me. I stood there for a while, waiting for them to even look up. Eventually, the girl started showing something to the guy on her phone, still without looking up. I said, 'I’m leaving, just so you know' and then they finally reacted at all. Earlier in the evening there were also a few times when I asked something and they didn’t respond — I thought maybe I’d just spoken too quietly.

I could go on with examples like this forever, but this post would never end. It’s really starting to get to me. I’m honestly jealous of people who are constantly texting someone, getting calls, meeting up — while I can’t even manage a normal small talk. The more I focus on fixing this — telling myself 'okay, today’s the day, I’ll be the best version of myself, I’ll take the initiative, I’ll smile and joke and talk with everybody' — the worse it seems to get. I’ve become obsessed with analyzing every single social situation I’m in. I’m not saying the problem is with everyone else — everything points to it being with me. That’s why I really want to figure this out and make some changes, because I feel like I’m going to lose my mind soon. How do I even start? How do I approach this?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1oiwl3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1oiwl3j/whydogirlsplaygames/,Why.Do.Girls.Play.Games,"Just removed a girl on ig after a series of red flags on her end.

I’m not Mr perfect but I try to be honest with ppl.

I met her at a concert where I was an usher I saw her during the first night and surprisingly she came to the next show the following day.
 She kept walking by me so I was like fuck it I’ll say sum.

 After we exchange pleasantries I asked her why she was single, she tells me that she’s busy. I was completely ready to let her go on her way but she Insisted on taking my IG. 

And to my suprise she even dmed me the same night. So I’m thinking wow she might not play games.

I send a message back and ask to meet for coffee I don’t hear from her till 2pm the next day. And she totally disregards my offer doesn’t even acknowledge it and just tells me sorry I’ve been busy and asks what I’m up to.

She gained some credit from me for dming me first so I continue to engage even tho I’m a bit annoyed lol

I reply and she disappears for 5 hrs and comes back with a dry response.

So I removed her and unfollowed myself.

Now to the untrained eye this might seem a bit harsh but coming from someone who’s dealt with a lot of girls (not bragging just speaking facts) I could see where this was goin. 

I think she wanting free texting attention with not intention of ever meeting up. Cuz the least she could do is acknowledge the offer and say no or yes or anything in between but to just ignore it is was deliberate.

Which brings me to the title of this post. I’ve had this thought for years but this is my first time “verbalizing” it. I understand why arranged marriages were a thing in the past.

Cuz left to their own devices girls will be girls lol you know what I mean.

And believe it or not, in our modern times we aren’t so far off from how things used to be. 

If a man makes enough money he can just pay a woman directly for whatever he wants instead of playing the game and wasting time. 

I’m no advocate for this but the more experiences I have the more I understand it. 

She could’ve just let it end at our nice conversation at the show. But instead she has me waiting for hrs to reply. I get it ppl are busy but I think in the initial stages there should be quick deliberate communication to remove all doubt that games aren’t being played if they are in fact not being played.

Don’t play coy and tell me you were busy. She could’ve just told me that in the morning I would’ve respected it.

ESPECIALLY since I know her phone is in her hand and the fact that you just met someone new should put you in a mind state to present the best version of yourself.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a 2 story barndominium can be an exciting venture. These structures blend the charm of traditional barns with modern, functional aesthetics. Whether you are considering building a new space or looking for innovative floor plans, there are many options to explore. Here are some fresh ideas that can inspire your dream barndominium.

### Open Concept Living Spaces

One of the most popular features in today's homes is the open concept layout. In a 2 story barndominium, this can create a spacious feeling while maximizing the use of space. Imagine walking into a large area where the kitchen, dining, and living room flow seamlessly. By incorporating large windows, you can enhance natural light and create an inviting atmosphere.

### Flexible Room Designs

Flexibility is essential in modern living. Consider designs that include multi-functional rooms. For instance, a den can easily transform into a guest bedroom, or an office space can serve as a home school area. When planning your layout, think about your family's needs and how they might change over time. This adaptability can make your living space more enjoyable and practical.

### Stylish Staircase Options

The staircase in a 2 story barndominium isn’t just a means to get upstairs; it can be a central design feature. Here are a few stylish ideas:

1oiwhwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oiwhwb/am_i_overreacting_for_feeling_like_my_friends/,Am I overreacting for feeling like my friends hate me?,"Okay, so throw away cuz idk how else to talk about this, and I've never done this before. Sorry if this is long-winded, but I feel like I'm spiraling harder than I have ever before.   
  
So for a bit of background, I (20), work in a creative field where we work in teams for either clients or long-term productions. Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's at an institution that specializes in my field, and part of the course is to do mock projects with teams, since we rely so heavily on group work and collaboration. Even though it is in the arts, there is a large industry with emphasis on networking, efficiency, and time management that creates a weird, toxic work yourself to death mentality. I had an internship over the summer that made me have multiple breakdowns over the rigor and expectations.   
Another big thing is that I am autistic, and with my physical disability in combination, it makes me easily overwhelmed and makes it hard to read anyone (hence why I'm here lol). In fact, a lot of my teammates are autistic and disabled as well, but I am definitely further on the spectrum than the rest of them when it comes to emotional regulation. I'm self-aware and mature enough to understand that my emotional regulation requires me to walk away and regulate myself physically, since it also makes me a chronic over-thinker and causes panic attacks. 

Now, we are working on this assignment that has to do with two particular facets of my field. Thanks to my internship and previous projects, I am actually very skilled in them, and I even work with one of my teammates outside of class to do this job in their passion project. I am on track to make it my specialized skill in the industry, but I eventually want to work my way up to a more director/administrator role. I decided to do it with my friends, whom I have experience working with before, and I know they would understand me and my disability. 

But here's where I feel like I might be overreacting. Throughout the entire project, there have been instances that I list here that make me feel like I'm going crazy:  
  
\- talking over all my pitch ideas at the initial meeting  
\- laughing at my sketches for our brainstorming session  
\-having meetings on the other side of our workspace while I have headphones in and not cluing me in to the convo  
\-making creative decisions during these meetings and not cluing me in  
\-planning hangouts with all of them when they know I have class  
\-bonus, when I skipped said class to come along, one of them said I was there just because of FOMO  
\-leaving/not saying goodbye and going to hang out together without me  
\-inviting each other over in front of me and acting disgruntled when I ask if I can come too  
\-Every idea I pitch is shut down and called ""cringey"" or ""silly.""  
\-not wanting to go to the gas station to get a soda when I suggest it, but when anyone else does, everyone joins  
\-not responding to my texts, but responding immediately when someone else texts about something else after me   
\-shutting down any of my lines of thinking   
\-went to an event, and I ended up being alone a big part of it because they all wanted to go off and do other things, AND made me hold their seats while they went off to get food. leaving me alone to cover seats for 5 people and didn't apologize when I got yelled at by the other patrons (also I was high- I can handle myself, but like cmon man)  
\- I suggested hanging out for Halloween, and no one reacted, but they were more excited to go get coffee at the school cafe when someone else suggested it 10 minutes later  
\-going out to lunch without me  
\-and finally, the big nail on the coffin: I did the final major edit, but they went in after me and removed all my artistic choices without talking to me or communicating it, and didn't tell me until right before we were supposed to turn it in

I feel like I'm going insane- like in context, these things maybe wouldn't seem as bad? I've just had so many cries and meltdowns over this, and I feel like I'm in my own head. I know it's probably just me, but I feel just like an outsider, and it's hitting too close to home, like when I used to get bullied in my early school days. I have no clue if it's that big of a deal to even mention, and maybe I'm just blowing it up in my head, and they're joking with me, and the instances aren't bad?  
I don't know, I just really need advice because the abandonment issues are flaring, and I'm starting to blame myself and feel like I'm the reason I can't keep friends. Any feedback would be amazing.",5,1761716390.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1oiwh40,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BadandyTheRed/comments/1oiwh40/the_graveyard_bells/,The Graveyard Bells,"My name is Ben, and in case something happens, I need to write down what I saw, or at least think I saw. Whether you believe me or not is up to you. I know what I am about to describe might sound crazy; I would have said it was impossible just a while ago. 



I know I should have just walked away when I saw the red flags. I should have listened to my gut. Sometimes, a job is not worth it, regardless of the pay. Now I fear whatever I saw last night could be looking for me this very moment. I should have left the first time I heard the bells. 



It started two weeks ago. I had lost my job and was looking for work. It had already been two months at that point since the factory closed and for the first time in years, I was unemployed. 

When I was looking for places that were hiring online, I noticed I had received a strange email. It was a work advertisement. 

“Now hiring, security personnel for night shift at Aurora Ridge Cemetery. Call for more details, no previous security experience required.” 

I was glad to see a potential job prospect had come to me. I never thought to look for security jobs, and definitely not at a place like a cemetery. I decided to call the number listed. The line rang for a minute until someone answered. It was a man with an odd inflection in his voice, like an accent slightly out of time. He was polite though and sounded genuinely happy someone had contacted him about the offer. 

“Oh, thank you for the call, my name is Victor Penny. I'm so glad you are interested in working with us at Aurora Ridge. I would like to arrange a short meeting and introductory tour if you are still interested in the job.” I was thrilled and eagerly responded, 

“Yes, thank you, Mr. Penny. I would love to, when can we meet?” 



“Well tonight at 9:30 pm would work for me, if it works for you.” I paused for a moment, surprised that it would be an interview the same night I had inquired and be so late in the evening. I did not second guess it though, I agreed, and Mr. Penny sounded delighted, almost like I was doing him a favor. 

“Oh fantastic, looking forward to seeing you here. Always happy to work with a new soul, take care and see you then.” He hung up and despite how odd the arrangement was, I was happy I might have a paycheck again. 



I set out at 9:00pm, leaving a bit of time to get there early, since Aurora Ridge was only a ten-minute drive from my apartment based on the directions.

The place seemed to be nestled out of the way, off the main road leading into town. When I first arrived, I had to double check that I was at the right place. I kept driving a little further on a dirt road and practically into the forest. 

When I came upon the main gate I was relieved. A tall iron fence crossed the clearing, and I saw the sign by the main gate and knew I was there. It read, 



“Welcome to Aurora Ridge Cemetery, where the light of lives rest eternal.” The gate was closed and when I stepped out of my car I was dismayed when I saw it was locked as well. I guessed I would just have to wait until Mr. Penny was there to let me in. 



I waited for a while and when I checked my phone, it was 9:40pm. I was getting worried that I had been tricked and that no one would show up. As I nervously glanced around the area, the light faded further and twilight glowed in the distance. Something about it was odd and made me do a double take. I thought I saw a strange light in the sky. It looked like it was coming from somewhere on the grounds, but further inside the cemetery. 



The strange thing was that the light was not in any shade of twilight I had ever seen. It was a sort of green, like one might see in the northern lights. It stood out amongst the other colors and the more I stared at the shifting pattern in the sky, the more unnatural the green light seemed to be. It lingered when the other colors faded away into the darkness of night, like it had a strange phosphorescence. 



The odd viewing of the lights was interrupted when I heard a car approaching and I looked and saw a large hearse driving down the road. It pulled up slowly and I could hear the pained grinding of the ancient vehicle, and it lurched to a halt. 



A man stepped out of the hearse. He wore a jet black suit and was very tall, but rail thin. Oddly, he also wore a pair of sunglasses that looked glaringly out of place in the dark night. He straightened his jacket and slid a hand back over his thin gray hair. He smiled when he saw me and walked over with a distinct, almost theatrical stride. He reached the gate and unlocked it and he sauntered towards me as the gate yawned open.

“Hello, Ben was it? Pleased to meet you. I trust you found the place alright?” I shook his outstretched hand and he gripped me disturbingly tightly. He kept smiling and shaking until I let go and responded, 



“Yes thank you sir, though I was afraid you might not be coming.” 

Mr. Penny looked apologetic, 

“Yes I know, so sorry for the inconvenience. I had to make a last minute pickup and I was delayed. Though I should give more care to the living, after all the dead can wait.” He chuckled at his own words, like an inside joke. He laughed it off and shrugged, 



“Well then shall we?”  He ushered me forward and we stepped in together.



Mr. Penny had insisted we walk, promising that the site was not far. Though as we moved I was struck by just how empty the place seemed to be. Only about a dozen gravestones lay scattered throughout the cemetery. As if reading my mind, Mr. Penny spoke as we walked. 



“You might notice the scarcity of graves here. Though our business is new, the lot is ancient. We have more residents here than it appears, but age, degradation and a rather distressing incident have destroyed many of the plots and stones. We still keep the grounds, but leave the other resting places unmarked and undisturbed.”  



I thought I saw that odd green light in the distance again before Mr. Penny pointed to a small building we were moving past. 



“That is the Groundskeepers building. Old Horus tends the grounds in the day, you might see him on the way out on some nights, but he does not normally stay after dark.”  

I nodded my head and we moved up the gentle hill toward a larger building in the distance. The green glow was gone and I started to wonder if I had really seen it at all. 



Mr. Penny spoke up again and pointed to the building, 



“Here we are, please follow me if you would. The station is here and we will discuss the job further, but the sight that really matters is just a short way further up the hill. We will get to that and more, assuming you agree to take the position.” He smiled awkwardly and I was confused by the comment. I thought I was guarding the entire cemetery. What was this other site? 



The security station came into clearer view as we moved closer, and I saw it had a strange, almost tower like lookout that jutted out of the roof, giving it the impression of a lighthouse looking out over a vast ocean of the buried dead. 



We walked up to the door and he fumbled with a large ring of keys. He glanced at me apologetically as he tried a few to no effect. Finally, the door opened on rusty hinges, and he held out a hand to invite me in. 



We walked inside and I saw it resembled a sparse cabin. Barely any furniture, besides a table, chair and a small footlocker. It was not what I had expected, I thought there might at least be a monitor and some security cameras. Near the corner I saw the only other door and a ladder that must lead to the odd lookout tower. 

The door closed behind us and it focused my attention back on Mr. Penny. 

“Well then, please take a chair, don’t worry I'll stand, seeing as how there is not an abundance of chairs.” He chuckled halfheartedly, and I smiled slightly to not disappoint his attempt at humor. 



“Here at Aurora Ridge, we value hard work and integrity. But we need to know we can trust you to do your best and not let base fears get in the way of your contributions. So, I must ask, are you afraid of the dead and their resting places?” I was taken off guard by the question, but I guessed it must be some sort of interview he was doing first so I answered honestly, 



“No, I’m not afraid of the dead or cemeteries sir.” 

He smiled at my answer, 

“Good, very good. Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?” 

I replied, “No.” Once again. Mr. Penny nodded his head and continued, 



“Good. You see many employees have left this job in the past. It is not for the faint of heart. I know it seems straightforward, just guarding the grounds at night. But alone and in the dark....”He paused, while fixing his stare on me and adjusting his sun glasses, but not taking them off. 

“Well people forget themselves, start to see things. The mind gets tired, fantastical stories start becoming believable, and even skeptics can start to believe absurd things. So, I assure you, if you follow the rules and do not give in to crazy musings, you will do well.” His smile was back and I was wondering how many people had this job before. 



“Speaking of doing well, we pay well for this position. The stress it puts on the mind can be harrowing, and we like to offer our night guardsmen something akin to hazard pay. Therefore, we are willing to offer a salary of $3000 a week.” 



My jaw almost hit the floor when I heard how much it paid. I had no idea what sort of security job paid that much, but I was stunned by the offer. 



“I see I have your attention, good. I will take that as a yes then?” 



I was already nodding my head eagerly, before he had even gotten into the particulars of the job. 



“Good very good, he smiled and held out his hand.” I shook it without even thinking to ask why the pay was so significant and why he had called it “Hazard pay” 



“Well then, please if you would, follow me. We have a special place to visit, and I need you to listen closely. The instructions are paramount to your success. I nodded my head and opened a note app on my phone. 



Mr. Penny led the way on a small path, lit only by the dim light of a small row of solar stake lamps. We ascended the hill and the path led into what looked like a thicket. Mr. Penny walked on, unbothered, and gestured me to follow. 



The small drape of plant life brushed away easily, and a somewhat concealed glen rested beyond. The area was hauntingly beautiful. Flowers grew around the soft green grass, and fireflies danced around a small tree near the center. The pretty ambiance distracted from the other key features in this tiny clearing. 



Near the center of the glen, were four evenly spaced gravestones. They were fairly large but not imposing. And each one had a small string hanging above them, connected to tiny bells. I thought it was odd, grave bells were not used anymore, since modern medical science had long since determined a way to verify if someone was truly deceased. Beyond the four graves was a small, but intricately detailed mausoleum.  



The sight of all the scenery was jarring. I took another step toward the surreal resting place. Suddenly Mr. Penny grabbed my shoulder, holding me back momentarily. He was looking at me as if appraising my reaction. 



“Beautiful isn't it? An oasis of calm, separate from the drudgery of life. Your first and most important job is keeping this place safe. I know you have many questions, but I am going to explain the most important expectations regarding security here at Aurora Ridge. Failure to comply with them will result in .... consequences, understood?” I nodded my head at his sudden change of tone, 



“Good, very good. I will be sure to remind you of that commitment. In fact your predecessor had to be terminated for failing to follow protocol. So if you wish to remain, you will listen carefully.""  



He sounded serious and I nodded my head and listened to the instructions. 



“Your work hours will be 10:00pm to 6:00am. You are not to leave until 6:00am unless expressly authorized.” 



“Breaks can be taken within reason, but you may not leave the grounds during breaks. You must stay at your post. Lunch's must be brought in with you, no delivery services of course.” 



“Bathroom breaks are of course permitted, but time should be strictly monitored. Sound systems should continue to be verified even during restroom breaks to ensure fast response should something happen.” 



“You are not to disturb the grounds directly, no going past or disturbing this line. Especially no going near the graves.” 



I looked to where he was pointing and it was the small white line that seemed to stretch on to the left and right. My foot had almost crossed it and I realized that was why Mr. Penny had stopped me. At first it looked like it was drawn on like a football field, but I noticed when I looked closer it seemed to be made of salt. 



Mr. Penny waited until I looked back up at him and continued. 



“Absolutely no trespassers. We are closed at night. Any and all trespassers must be detained and dealt with. There is a channel on the radio that you must call if intruders are detected, channel six. Your job is observation, other security personnel will detain them, prior to removal by law enforcement, understood? ” 



I nodded my head again and he moved on, 



“Sometimes external influences can disrupt the lines of demarcation, if this occurs, please re-apply the security salt to ensure the ring stays whole at all times.”  



“This last rule is critical; you must abide. Are you paying attention?” He asked sharply. I nodded my head and confirmed. 



“If the graveyard bells ring, even if it is just one. You are to press the SOS  button on your radio to signal the event. Then you must evacuate immediately. You will have exactly three minutes to make your way up the hill and to the mausoleum outside the ring. Then you are to use this key and enter the mausoleum, close the door and wait until morning, no earlier than 6:00am. Do you understand?”  



It was the strangest request so far; I had no idea why the bells would ring. Unless someone was buried alive.... 



I couldn't help but ask after that one, 



“But sir why would they...” Mr. Penny cut me off, 



“They almost never do, but strange things can happen here. Even if you think it is just the wind, it's better to be safe than sorry. Go to the mausoleum, lock up and stay put. Any interaction with the bells after they ring, even waiting to watch what happens after the first three minutes will be..... a problem. Nothing will happen to you if you follow the rules, understand?” 



I was concerned and very skeptical, but I was more desperate to have a paycheck again. I figured I would follow whatever superstitious rules I was given if it meant not being broke anymore. I nodded my head and agreed, 

“Yes.” 

Mr. Penny beamed at my response, 

“Excellent, well then if that's all settled I will show you to the tower. We have the watch tower there to keep a safe eye on the place while keeping a respectful distance. There are night vision binoculars, a directional microphone, and a radio there. Along with spare batteries for the lot back in the security building. The station also has a small restroom which we have stored some extra salt in as well, should you need to reapply it.”  

He led me back to the building and I stepped inside. I saw the small footlocker that he mentioned the devices were in. When I turned back and saw Mr. Penny was not coming inside, he did an about face and smiled,  



“Oh I’m sorry, I forgot to mention, I need you to start tonight, I hope that's alright?” I was surprised, but felt like I couldn't say no without jeopardizing the opportunity, so I reluctantly agreed, 

“Yeah, I mean yes of course.” 



“Fantastic, I knew I was right about you, take care and keep your eyes peeled and ears open. Have a good night my friend.” 

He closed the door and just like that I was alone at my new job, watching over a small grave site for an absurd salary and following a bizarre list of rules. 

I looked around again briefly and realized I should probably head up the small tower and take a look from my vantage. It sounded like I was going to spend most of my nights there. 



I opened the footlocker near the ladder and removed a surprisingly nice and expensive looking pair of night vision binoculars. I switched it on and the battery charge was full. There was also a small directional microphone, which had a wireless headset it connected to. I also grabbed the handheld radio and switched it on. I stowed the items and climbed the ladder to the lonesome tower. 



I saw a folding chair set aside in the lookout and was grateful that I was not expected to stand there for hours on end. Though I regretted not bringing something to help pass the time. I had not expected to work that night, but with the knowledge of the payday I had in store, a few boring hours watching some graves was nothing. 



I grabbed the small chair, unfolded it and set it up so it would be facing toward the hill I had to watch. When I sat down, I saw that I had a good view of the surroundings acres of grounds. It was all positioned just right to see directly into the little glen that housed my charge. 

While looking closer with the binoculars, I noticed something odd. None of the four special gravestones had any names, or any markings on them. They were all blank. I found it strange, but once again I did not question my fortune in guarding them. 



After an hour and a half, my eyes started to get tired constantly looking out at the site. The perimeter ring was undisturbed; nothing was moving about. Barely even a breeze to disturb the dead silence of it all. I switched over to the directional microphone and pointed it at the site to confirm. 

As I had expected there was nothing, at first. Then I thought I heard a low groaning, creaking sound. It was odd, but not too concerning. After a while I started hearing another sound, like a persistent scratching and tapping. 

It continued for half an hour and I was about to go investigate. Then it suddenly stopped just as I was about to go back down. I managed to make it through the rest of the night with no further issues. 



Almost the entire first week was uneventful, but on Friday, something happened. 



I had a routine prepared for the long haul, including snacks and entertainment to pass the time while staying focused on my objective. I couldn't listen to anything since I had to keep an ear out for the bells on the microphone, but I was able to steal a few moments of time to read a book. I wanted to use my phone, but reception was bad so it was a nonstarter.

I made it through almost the entire night and was so engrossed by the book I was reading that I did not pick up on the sounds coming through the mic at first. It took me a second to realize I was hearing voices coming from the tree line. I propped the mic up so I could still hear and grabbed the binoculars. I looked out at the graves and did not see anything at first. Then I saw rustling in the foliage near the mausoleum and three figures emerged. I had to do something, they were heading for the site. I heard the voices speaking clearer as I trained the mic directly on them, 



“How did we even get this far Erin? And what light are you talking about? It is too dark to see anything out here.” The first voice spoke, sounding like a young man. Another responded to the question curtly, 



“I know what I saw Jess, there was a weird green light, it was coming from here, it didn't look natural.” 



“Guys we shouldn't be here, this place, there's something not right about it.” Another voice spoke up, meek and concerned. She was right about one thing they shouldn't be there. I had to figure out what to do. 



I remembered the instructions and switched on the radio to channel six.  



“This is Ben, in the tower. There are three trespassers by the site, going down now to investigate.” There was no response, so I just moved on, grabbing my flashlight and rushing downstairs. 

I sprinted toward the glen and made it through just in time to see the three strangers stepping over and disrupting the salt line. They all looked fairly young, two girls and a boy, probably in their teens. I shouted out a warning, 

“Stop! This is private property!” Two of them held up their hands, even though it was only a flashlight I was holding. The third looked at me with a mixture of confusion and fascination. 



“What is this place?” The girl had asked, sounding like she was speaking while in a dream. 



The other two looked scared and confused. I spoke again, slightly softer than before. 



“This is private property and a graveyard satisfied? Now clear off. You are not supposed to be here.” I tried to sound commanding, but not overly hostile. 



Her two friends shrunk back, clearly not wanting to get in trouble, but she stepped forward and asked me a surprising question, 



“I came for the light; did you see it too? There was something in it, it called me here.” I shined my flashlight on her and her expression looked oddly distant. The mention of the light was weird. I remembered the green light I had seen the first day. Maybe this group had seen it too? I felt guilty for detaining them, but knew I had to get them to leave. I lowered my hands, and tried to get them to listen. 



“I’m not sure what light you think called you here, but you all should get back home, it is late and you look like high schoolers. Your parents must be worried. Do you live close?” 



The girl in the middle, Erin as I had heard her friends call her, offered an odd response. 



“I... don’t know. I can't remember?” She sounded scared suddenly. The other two looked at her and then at each other. I shined the light on them again and I saw their eyes were glassy. I thought they might have taken some psychedelics or something, since they did not seem to be all there. Then when I looked closer, I saw a hint of unnatural green light reflecting off their eyes.   

The effect was eerie, and I decided to lead them out of there. I hoped they had a number I could call to have their parents pick them up. I explained my plan to them and they agreed. 



“Yeah....yeah lets go, I think it was a mistake coming here. Somethings wrong with this place, I don’t like it.” The boy said as if waking up from a dream. The girls nodded and suddenly looked more lucid than when they had arrived. I was relieved and started ushering them out. 

But before I could show the way back, I was startled when I heard a loudspeaker demanding that the group, 



“Freeze!” It was two large men in riot style security gear. I did not know why they were there, but then I remembered the radio call. I tried to explain the situation, but the two men brushed past me and seized two of the teenagers roughly. I tried to protest, but one of them knocked me down in the pursuit and I fell hard. 

Erin had tried to get away, even while her friends had been seized, but as she reached the tree line, a third figure grabbed her. It was Mr. Penny. The teens protested and struggled, and I did not like the force that the others were using to detain them. Before I could voice my concern, Mr. Penny spoke. 



“Very good Ben, nice work. Looks like we got here before they could do any damage. We will escort them off the premises, after some community service.” I replied, trying to see if I could help. 



“Thank you, sir. Though they don't seem like they came here to cause trouble, maybe we can let them go without involving the police?” 



Mr. Penny chuckled then responded. 



“Oh they should be so lucky, no we will let them go, after they re-salt the circle. Then we will put them back where they belong. But you must not concern yourself, since we are here and will be repairing the damage, you are free to go for the last few hours. Go home and get some sleep, I will handle it from here.”  



I did not like the situation. I looked at the teens and they were not shouting or protesting; they just seemed to be staring at the graves, like they were in a trance. I thought I saw the weird light emerging from the ground for a split second before it was gone. 

Then I saw the two men in riot gear holding large bags of salt. It looked like one of them was moving tools and I thought I saw a shovel in his hands. 



My heartbeat quickened and I was getting nervous about what was happening. But as I was about to protest going home, Mr. Penny stood up and walked over to me. He put an arm on my shoulder and turned me around to face him directly, I saw he was holding his sunglasses in his hand and I realized it was the first time I had seen him take them off. 



“Don’t work too hard. Just go home...now.” 



I remembered looking up and facing him. After that I don’t remember what I saw. 



The next thing I knew it was 6:15am. I was asleep in my car, parked just outside my apartment. I had no recollection of how I got back. Somehow, I had left, driven home and fell asleep in my car in those last two hours. 

Something was seriously wrong, but I had no way of explaining just what it was.  I had wanted to talk to Mr. Penny about the strange experience, but he was absent for most of the next week. I grew more nervous about what had happened, but I kept going back. I did not like it, but felt like I had no choice. 



That weekend I had another strange experience. Someone was knocking on my apartment door that Saturday night. When I answered it, I saw a large bald man standing there.  He stared at me for a moment before doing anything, then pulled out a small manilla folder and handed it to me. I was confused, but when I looked, I saw it had $3000 in cash stuffed inside. The large man spoke, in a dull monotone voice, 



“Aurora Ridge thanks you for your work, have a good evening.” The man reached into his coat and pulled out a pair of sunglasses that looked a lot like Mr. Pennys and just as he was about to place them on his head, I swear I saw a glint of green that did not look natural. He turned and walked away.

When I returned on Monday night, I found that I had a visitor. It was not Mr. Penny, but an ancient, looking man who wore the dirt speckled coveralls of the groundskeeper. 

He looked me up and down and scoffed as I entered. I waved to greet him and knew it must be Horus. 

He was holding a large bag of salt and I saw several more in the corner.  He scowled, then finally spoke, 



“You must be Charlie's replacement. Haven't seen that big bald bastard around but he owes me a pack of cigarettes. Though if you're here it means old Charlie must have made a mistake. Anyway it‘s windy tonight. I brought extra salt. You are going to need it, don't let the line break. I don’t want that light anywhere near the garden or anywhere else where it can get into. Don’t forget or its your ass!” He brushed past me and shot me one last hateful look before departing, slamming the rattling door as he did. 



I was shocked and confused, what happened to Charlie? Then I considered the large bald man I had not seen before who delivered my pay. He sounded a lot like this Charlie, but hadn't he been fired? Either way it did not matter, I had to get to work. 



I climbed the ladder up to the lookout and after the first thirty minutes the wind whipped up so strongly that the lines of salt began to blow away and several sections were barren. I nearly spat out my coffee and knew I had to get down there quickly. 



I rushed back down and grabbed one of the bags of salt Horus had left. It was heavy and I wished I had some way of moving multiple bags, but there was no dolly or truck to do so. I hefted the bag up the hill and opened it, moving to where I had seen the broken section of the ring, and started pouring. As soon as I had finished, I saw more sections required repair. I made several more trips and was getting tired quickly. 



I managed to patch all the larger holes in the line, but there was one last segment that had a visible break. I had to stop and catch my breath for a moment. Then I could go get another bag and fix it. 

As I sat there and looked at the silent site, I shuddered when I remembered the night where the teens had broken in. I hoped that Mr. Penny had let them go like he said he would. I did not like the way they looked at the strange light or how I had lost the last two hours of my night when I tried to ask him about it. 



As I caught my breath, I saw something inexplicable. There was a corona of that green light emerging from the ground near the edge where the break in the line was. I saw a small opossum walk toward the light. It moved in a straight line and did not seem bothered by the fact that I was watching it.  

Then I saw the light seemed to stretch out and beyond the ring and reach out to the small animal. The glint of green that reflected in its eyes was terrible, and I stood up and rushed back down the hill to grab another bag and complete the circle again. 



When I got back the animal was gone. I could not be sure, but I thought I saw scratch marks on the ground near the ring, like something had tried digging there. I finished the ring and mercifully the wind had died down. As I tried to understand what had just happened, I heard something that froze my heart. I heard the chiming of a bell. 



I looked on in horror as one of the gravestone bells was slowly ringing. It was not the wind, it was not any external force. The bell was ringing and I had to act fast. I pressed the SOS button on the radio as I had been instructed and looked at the stone mausoleum nearby.  



A morbid part of me wanted to wait and see what was happening. It had to be some trick, it couldn't really be ringing on its own. But I had no time for questions, I remembered Mr. Penny’s warning and went to the mausoleum, searched for the silver key and opened it. 

I took one last look outside and confirmed that the small bell was still ringing, before closing the heavy door and locking it again, sealing me off from whatever was happening outside. I expected something at the three-minute mark, but I heard nothing. There was no window so I couldn't see anything, but I swear I saw that damnable green light glowly softly from somewhere near the graves and peaking under the heavy door.  



I realized I still had my headset for the directional mic turned on. I had propped the mic on the chair, pointing down at the graves while I moved the salt. When I put the headphones on I heard an odd static. I was not sure what could be making the sounds, but after waiting for almost an hour, I heard something else. It was a consistent scraping, digging sound, followed by a loud crash, like someone hitting wood with metal. I held my breath and after a long moment I thought I heard a voice, 



“No, not yet. This one needs more time, they aren't ready. Just a bit more, put them back.” 



Then I heard the wooden crash again, followed by more digging. After a while all the sounds had fallen silent. I was left cold and alone, in that dark tomb, terrified, but ultimately oblivious to what had just occurred right outside. 



I considered asking Mr. Penny about the bells again, but I did not know if I could trust whatever his answer might be. Whatever was going on at Aurora Ridge, it was getting more concerning by the day. 



I spent almost another entire week there, in tense anticipation of something terrible happening. I was getting freaked out and despite the large payday, I was not sure it was smart to keep showing up. 



It was Thursday on week three, that the reality of the situation was laid bare, and I saw the thing I could never unsee. 



It was a particularly cold night, and I feared the wind would whip the salt off the ring again, or worse I would hear the bells. I was already on edge, when I arrived and when I saw the rain beginning to fall, my mood did not improve. I climbed the ladder to my lookout and struggled to hear anything over the deluge of rain. I paned around with my binoculars and saw the hideous aurora of light emerging and reflecting the water in the air like a disturbing mono colored rainbow. 



I wanted to look away but the sight was captivating. I felt myself being drawn into the morbid spectacle and I took an involuntary step forward. I managed to stop myself before I fell over the edge. Something clattered down the roof and smashed into the ground and I realized I had dropped the directional microphone.  

I cursed my bad luck but was grateful it had been that and not me that fell over. I looked over at the grave site and saw something surprising. Despite the wind moving the salt the other day, the water from the rain did not seem to be dissolving the ring like I had expected.  



I was ready to bolt down and reapply it when I knew the rain was falling, but somehow it had stayed there, unaffected. I tried to distract myself by reading for a while, but I was paranoid by the lack of a microphone. I had gone down to the footlocker to find another but it was empty. There must have only been one. I tried the radio to call for help and get another, but all I got was static. 



Since I could not hear anything, I tried to be hyper vigilant with the binoculars and looked around frequently. In another few hours I was getting tired, but was glad the terrible night was almost over. All the coffee I had that night made forced me to take a restroom break. When I got back up the ladder I looked out again, expecting to see nothing but rain splashing off the ground. Instead I saw movement. To my horror, I looked again and saw three of the four bells ringing side to side. I had no idea how long they had been ringing at that point.  

I panicked and pressed the SOS button on the radio, Then I half climbed, half slid down the ladder, landing hard at the bottom. 



I sprinted up the hill and as soon as I entered the clearing, I saw hellish light bathing the gravestones. The green glow seemed to pulse in time with the maddening chiming of the bells. I rushed to the mausoleum as the storm intensified. As I fumbled for the keys I felt an odd tinge of static that in the next instant made me involuntarily fall back.

I was glad I had leaped back, since in the next instant, a jagged bolt of incandescent green lightning struck near the mausoleum and hit with such tremendous force that a large cracked split a section off the front of the building. 

I looked up in a terrible instance and saw the storm had taken on an otherworldly quality that made me dizzy to look at. I picked myself up, opened the door and dove into the mausoleum, closing it behind me. 



As I tried to catch my breath after the insane events, I felt a chill and realized something was wrong, the structure was damaged, and I could see through the fractured facade of the mausoleum wall. I could see everything. A large group of hooded figures had appeared, gathered around the gravestone. One wore the distinct sunglasses of Mr. Penny. Others had shovels and were digging at the ground by the gravestones. Piles of dirt were dug up and cast aside, as they moved deeper. I heard three shovels striking wood in unison. 



I looked on in numb horror as the green lighting struck the ground around where they had dug up three of the four graves. They bent down in unison and pulled the caskets out of the graves. I was not able to see who or what was in the coffins, but something about the way the reverently stood around them was disturbing.  



I heard a ringing sound in my ears and a loud voice spoke out, it was terrible and commanding and I was shocked when I saw it was Mr. Penny who seemed to be speaking in a voice that sounded nothing like his own. 



“Bring them forward.” 



Two of the hooded figures brought a limp body up towards him and I nearly cried out when I saw the body and recognized the girl. It was Erin, one of the teens who had broken in with her friends to see the light. She was unresponsive, but Mr. Penny reached down and touched her head, then the two robed figured moved her body up toward him and he took off his glasses and I suppressed a horrified gasp as I saw the empty pits that hid underneath, he looked like he should be blind, he had no eyes! Yet he reached out to touch the face of the young girl and a terrible green light filled his hollow eyes and seemed to run down his hands and flow like a terrible river into Erin’s limp body.  



Then the eldritch green light flashed, sparked, and a dull rumble was heard, followed by a gasp of air. She was alive, but as her eyes fluttered open, I saw the same inhuman green flame in them as well. They were about to repeat the ritual, when I heard mutterings and one of the robbed figures asked Mr. Penny about the fourth grave. 



“He held up a finger and then pointed in my direction at the mausoleum and all I could hear was, 



“Soon.” 



I huddled down, unable to look at the blasphemous scene any longer. My head started to hurt and there was a ringing in my ears, then I blacked out. When I woke up it was morning. I stole a peek outside and saw that the grave sites were just as they had been before. Undisturbed, even the soil looked unbothered. I started to wonder if it could all have been a terrible nightmare. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, slowly turned around and left.  



I drove home in a daze, conscious but bewildered. When I got back I tried to process what I saw that night. I decided to look into Mr.Penny and see if I could find something out about him. When I started looking, I was horrified at my revelation. 

Victor Penny, the original owner of Aurora Ridge cemetery had died eighty-five years ago. No known descendants, no family. I remembered the hollow eyes from that night, the green flames burning in his skull. and I shuddered.

The terrible revelations continued when I saw on the news that three teens had been declared missing after failing to return home the previous week. When I saw their faces and heard the names announced my heart sank. It was the same three from that night, all of them had been standing right in front of me a little over a week ago. 



The implications made me sick when I considered the graves, three of them, three people taken. Three bells ringing out, then the sight of one of them screaming back to life in the hands of Mr. Penny. 

I stayed home that night. I could not sleep and the nervous tension made me paranoid. I started writing and someone knocked on my door. It was nearly midnight, and I grabbed a kitchen knife on my way to investigate. I looked out the peephole and nearly gasped aloud when I saw the face of that young girl, Erin. She was just standing there, smiling. I almost reached for the door but as I did she spoke. 



“Hello Ben, please remember to call out if you are feeling sick in the future. Don’t forget it’s payday tomorrow. We have something for you back at Aurora Ridge, please come back. It won’t take long and you can finally find a place where you belong. Think of the light, the bell, the last one can be for you. Mr. Penny was right, I can see things now, things I could never see before. You can too.” 



She left at some point, and I was alone again. That was last night. I have not left my apartment since then. They keep showing up, beckoning me back to that place where souls return to bath in that monstrous light that claims the living and the dead. In the distance I swear I could hear the fourth bell chiming for me. Calling me to the deepest parts of the earth, to find out the secrets of the chthonic realm of dark stone and death. 



The sound is getting louder, but I will try and ignore it tonight. I need to finish this account. If anyone is reading this, do not trust the light, do not listen to the things it brings back and most of all do not listen to Mr. Penny, if he offers you something that is too good to be true.

I still remember the first time I tried making espresso at home.  
I bought a fancy-looking machine with so many buttons, dials, and blinking lights that it felt like flying a small plane.

I filled the portafilter, tamped the coffee, pressed start — and ended up with a bitter mess. The next day, I tried again. Still wrong. After a week, I gave up and went back to instant coffee.

A few months later, I visited my cousin’s house. He made me a perfect cup of espresso in less than a minute. I asked how he did it, expecting a long explanation. He just laughed and said,

1. Grey Soul :- Strawberry in Loop : This is where heaven meets earth , I don't know what they do but this is exquisite. It has like all the berry flavors in it ( I felt strawberry and blueberry dominantly ) and it's not even that acidic in taste.  This is for the espresso I did not do it in the moka. 
2. Mannheim : I don't remember the name of the coffee but this was good too like it had all this caramelly kinda flavor with a bit of a dark chocolate in it , it was good would buy again. Brewed espresso and moka and tasted similar in both but could feel more flavors in espresso than the one from moka. Recommended to me by a fellow redditor in my previous thread
3. Carabi & Blue Tokai :- Vienna Roast : Not good , I won't recommend carabi it tastes shit , there's no oaky flavor or any choclate notes in it it's just pure bitterness with nothing in it , blue tokai atleast had the notes it claimed and it tasted mid , I like dark roasts but I won't recommend carabi's , blue tokai can still be recommended
4. Araku :- Selection : This is cool shit , It tastes good , it has all the notes which they claim to be there , I also got a little bit of chocolaty note in there I don't if I brew it at wrong temperature or something but this is my daily now and I just can't go back. It tastes good in both moka and espresso , did not notice much difference between the notes in both only that in moka I noticed a little bit of chocolaty essence. 

TLDR: Grey Soul and Araku have no competition , Mannheim is good would buy again , Blue tokai is mid and carabi is shit. 

If any of you guys had different experiences with any of the coffees which I've wrote here please let me know because I am still learning and I am open to trying anything you guys recommend , I personally don't like using my french press and I don't have a pour over and aeropress setup so please keep that in mind while recommending.

I am 60 years old and work in a toxic environment, they tread lightly around me because I have a reputation for knowing my rights as an employee and holding management accountable when they violate them.

Anyway I’ve been using my age and health issues as an excuse to slack off and get special treatment.

Nothing serious, I’m just looking to make to retirement without going insane.

So as far they see me, I’m deaf, blind, and on death’s doorstep. 

Well I inadvertently discovered another instrument for my repertoire… 

Over the weekend, I messed up my regular DIY crew cut and ended up shaving my head clean.

Not what I wanted but not terrible but I never considered what people would infer from me showing up on Monday as a total skinhead.

On the clock doing my humdrum reports I overheard my boss saying to her assistant “no wonder he’s been seeing the doctors so often” 

“He’s got cancer and doesn’t want anyone to know!” 

I choked on my coffee when I heard that and they realized that I had overheard them. I had to to go to the bathroom before I lost my composure, I went in, closed the door and turned on the faucet and had to muffled my hysterical laughter with paper towels.

They must have thought I was upset and crying because there was an awkward silence after I came out. Neither would look me in the eye.

After a while my boss asked if I would like to go home, I said yes, because I I was feeling a little under the weather.

Now I know if I lie and try to say that I have cancer, I am committing fraud, but if I let them believe that I’m being stoic and not asking for time off, they can’t ask about it. 

But I can let them believe it and accept their largess when offered. They cannot ask about it so if it gets discovered that I don’t actually have cancer. I can honestly say that I never claimed to have cancer. They couldn’t say anything to me.

Suddenly your friend tells you she’s been unemployed since April, your other friend is suddenly working “billable hours” and is so busy and doesn’t have time in the day.  What a “coincidence” 🙄🙄. Is this their way of “sticking it to me” to say “you should be grateful and kiss the ring”.  You are grateful for your opportunity but not exactly happy taking a step down - BOTH things can be true.

Or your neighbour fell on her coffee table and broke her ribs, and suddenly your parent also took a “fall” and almost fell into the coffee table 🙄🙄

The people working with gangstalkers always love to plant coincidences and relevant topic to stick something to you and manipulate. Even if it is what you buy at the grocery store, to life situations, to literally anything. 

Nothing, absolutely nothing, drives me as crazy as the “staged setup, planted” conversations to control, manipulate, or alter your opinion.

It’s so annoying and designed to discredit your own thoughts and values, while brainwashing you with trauma based mind control for DUMMIES.

Early on, my ex pulled a ""out with friends"" fib that turned my stomach: Said she was grabbing coffee with a girlfriend, but mutuals spotted her solo at a bar we used to hit. Brushed it off as ""no big deal,"" but it gnawed – small lie, big echo. I swallowed it for months, chasing ""us"" harder to prove trust. Spoiler: Lies like that aren't isolated; they're symptoms. When the full breakup hit, that crack had widened to a chasm. If you're staring at a ""where was she?"" text that's souring your gut, here's my no-fluff advice from the fallout – spot it early, or it spots you.

I replayed that lie in therapy loops, realizing confrontation isn't about ""winning"" – it's intel for your next move. Here's what I'd tell my younger self (and you now):

**Confront Calm, But Clock the Response**  
Don't ambush – lead with facts, not accusations: ""Hey, I heard you were with \[friend\] – everything cool?"" Gauge: Does she own it quick (""Oops, misspoke – was solo"") with remorse, or deflect (""Why check up?"")? My ex gaslit into ""you're paranoid,"" flipping my doubt onto me. Red flag: Deflection > Disclosure. Pro tip: Time it neutral (post-dinner walk, not heated hour) – emotions cloud truth.

**The Lie Ladder – Small Fibs, Big Falls**  
One ""harmless"" whereabouts white lie? Often climbs: Next, ""late at work"" becomes dodged calls. Audit patterns: Isolated slip (stress-fueled)? Forgivable with apology + change. Habit (phone hides, vague plans)? Trust erosion alert. For me, it masked her emotional checkout – ignoring it cost me years. Science nudge: Studies show chronic fibbers erode oxytocin (bond hormone); rebuild only if they commit (couples counseling, transparency apps like shared location if mutual).

**When to Walk (or No Contact) – Protect Your Peace First**  
If the talk bombs (denial, blame-shift), don't chase closure – it's a myth. Go no contact: Block, breathe, redirect. I waited for ""her side,"" but silence healed faster than excuses. Stack small shields: Daily journal (""What do I deserve?""), 10-min walks to dump the rumination. You're not ""giving up"" – you're upgrading. If it's salvageable? She'll show effort unprompted. Mine didn't; I found solo hikes > haunted hopes.

That lie wasn't the end – my silence on it was. Now? Grateful for the redirect to real connections. You're not paranoid for questioning; you're protecting a heart worth it.

What's one ""lie"" that tipped your scales, and how'd you handle the talk? Spill – no shame, just shared scars.

TL;DR: Girlfriend lies about whereabouts? Confront fact-first, spot deflection as red flag, audit patterns – no contact if no change. Protect peace over proof.

Back in 2022, I (currently 21F) met this guy (currently 21M). We were both 18 and just starting college. He also had just started college. Both of us got invited to a party after joining the furry club on our campus. Neither of us were party people, but we both saw it as an opportunity to make friends. I brought my iPad to draw because I knew I would get socially anxious and bored lol. While at the party, he approached me and expressed interest in what I was drawing. (He has said this to me but I did not recall him doing this oops lol)

A little while after, I came out of my class and discovered that someone accidentally locked their bike to my bike’s brake cord. I was pretty frustrated, but he took notice of this and immediately stepped in. He has this mini compact toolkit with him all the time, so he managed to remove the brake cord of my bike and fixed it. We both had the same class after that, so we started to sit next to each other and talk a lot. He showed me what he had been drawing on his tablet that day. It was a bird sitting next to a mango. I thought it was so cute.

I got to know him better after I invited him and a couple of friends to meet for coffee and do homework once or twice a week. Sometimes we would talk about a variety of topics, whether that be history, politics, funny stories, art, anything. He always had a really creative and smart take on certain subjects, and sometimes I would be hooked on him talking.

One day I got a text from him saying something along the lines of “Would you like to go on a date? I’ve never met a girl who is a furry and I think we have a lot in common”
I thought the text was actually really funny. At the time, I thought I was gay. But during our coffee chats I started noticing that I was looking at him… like, a lot. I had never been attracted to a guy before. Because of this I thought to myself “Maybe I’m just noticing that he’s conventionally attractive,” so I dismissed the thought of me maybe being bisexual. So my response to his text was “Sorry but I’m super gay. I’m flattered though! I hope we can still be friends.”

We still did our coffee chats with friends, and everything seemed normal. Summer passes by, and in fall 2024, I started thinking about him a lot, and at this point I accepted that I might be bisexual. I asked him if we could do a coffee chat again, but just the two of us. We had a really great conversation about life, the world, etc. He brought up the fact that he had been on many dates with guys (he’s also bi), but each time the date would end up with him in bed with them. He felt unsatisfied, because he prefers women, and he also wanted a more meaningful relationship. I desperately wanted to tell him that I wanted to try having sex with him, but after he said that I didn’t want to hurt his feelings or make him feel dismissed. I also didn’t want to ruin our friendship if I were to get rejected.

That night we went home, and I thought I’d take my chances. He told me he wanted to go on a date in the past, and my friends said I should go for it. So I did. I sent an embarrassingly long text to him, and immediately ran into the shower, anxiety overflowing me. I shakily reached for my phone after getting dressed, and saw 3 texts from him. He was surprised, and seemed pretty excited to hear that. I told him I was so relieved because I didn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable. But our texts quickly became pretty spicy, so TLDR I grabbed come condoms and snuck into his house at 1 am. I walked in, and he lit a candle and was dressed in only his robe. It was so cheesy and I found it super cute. And it was the most uncomfortable sex I had ever had LOL. He’s actually pretty big and I was bleeding a lot, as I hadn’t inserted anything larger than a small toy into me. He was very gentle, but my body wasn’t used to it. 

Afterwards, I felt so anxious that I couldn’t sleep next to him, so I ended up going home after and threw up. I felt so bad and I thought that our friendship was ruined. But things kept happening, and we had sex a couple more times, and it was really fun and it felt really good. We did do other things besides sex too, and I started to get to know him a lot more than I did before. I realized that he’s extremely empathetic, silly, and inquisitive. It was fairly obvious that I had true feelings for him, so one night, we had sex and cuddled, and “Cryin’” by Aerosmith was playing in the background. I told him that I did have feelings for him, and he felt the same. We just sat there and held each other for a while, and after that, we finally went on an official date. We got breakfast together and talked for hours. 

That next month, I had started to fall in love with him. It seems quick, I know, but we had been friends for 2 years before that. But I have never felt so comfortable around someone. I adored his vocal stims, the fact that he always said thank you to the bus driver, how he always stepped in when someone needed help, how clean his space is, how much he loves talking about nuclear engineering and history, how he always wanted to feed me cookies and wrap me in blankets if I was sad, the way he looks at me, how much he loves art and birds as much as I do, how much he loves nature and bugs, and so much more. 

It’s coming up to our one-year anniversary soon, and I have truly learned about what a wonderful person he is. No relationship is perfect, but damn does it feel close to it. We’ve had arguments and differences, but we have never been able to resolve them in a healthy way. And his family is amazing too. I met them for the first time in August, and because they live in Colorado, we flew there. His family was so happy to meet me, that they BOUGHT MY FREAKING PLANE TICKET. I tried to pay them back multiple times but his parents declined each time. My boyfriend had told them about how I struggled with money growing up, and his mom had a heart-to-heart with me about how she wanted to pay for me because she knew what that was like, and she wanted me to enjoy myself without worrying about that. I just… cried. And that week I was there, they took time off to take us on so many adventures. No wonder why my boyfriend is such an amazing person. His parents are too. 

This man has brought me so much joy. He is the light to my day, and there is never a day where he’s not on my mind. My true self reveals itself around him, and I can rest easy knowing that I have someone who understands me. This is the first time in my life where I can envision myself getting married and starting a family with a partner. Obviously I’m too young for that right now, but my god, I hope it happens some day.

Thought ""winning her back"" was the prize – playlists of our songs, grand gestures, the works. Spoiler: It backfired hard, left me smaller, and her even further gone. That ""no BS guide"" vibe floating around (no contact, glow-up, wait for the boomerang)? It's solid for healing, but here's the raw truth I clawed from the wreckage: ""Winning them back"" sounds epic, but it's often a trap that keeps you chained to the wrong story. I chased the fairy tale; reality? It was my cue to rewrite mine.

Grinding through those first foggy months, I tested every ""get ex back"" hack – and yeah, some worked short-term (she pinged once, post-rebound crash). But long-game? It delayed my real win: Me, unbreakable. If you're tempted by the guides (and trust, I was), here's my stripped-down advice to spot if it's worth it – or time to level up solo:

**Audit the Why – Is It Love or Limbo?**

Before any move, gut-check: Are you chasing the person, or the idea of ""us""? Mine was 80% ego bruise, 20% real spark. List three things you miss (her laugh? The routine?). If it's more ""what we had"" than ""who she is now,"" pause. Science bit: Attachment theory says breakups trigger loss aversion – we cling harder to avoid the void. Journal it out: ""What if staying solo builds something fiercer?""

**No Contact as Your Weapon, Not Their Bait**

Guides nail this: 30-60 days radio silence to reset. But don't clock-watch for their text – use it to stack your deck. I deleted apps, hit daily walks (endorphins crushed the ""what if"" loop), and rebuilt hobbies (woodworking turned ""lost"" into ""maker""). Pro tip: Track three daily wins in a note app – ""Nailed that call,"" ""Laughed at a meme."" By week 4, the pull faded; her reach-out felt like an option, not oxygen.

**The 'Win Back' Test – Actions Over Apologies**

If they circle back (mine did at month 6), don't default ""yes."" Demand proof: What changed? Therapy receipts? Consistent effort matching words? I grilled mine on patterns (fades, space requests) – vague answers were my exit sign. Real win? Mutual growth, not one-sided rescue. If it's lopsided, walk – you're dodging a sequel flop.

**Flash forward:** That ""win back"" chase? It freed me for hikes with my dog, random chats that spark joy, and realizing the real prize was the guy staring back stronger. You're not ""failing"" if they don't return – you're upgrading. Guides are tools, not destinies.

What's one ""win back"" myth that's tripped you, and how are you flipping it? Share below – no judgment, just real talk.

**TL;DR:** ""Winning ex back"" guides help heal, but chase love, not limbo – audit why, weaponize NC for you, test actions if they return. Real win: You, unbreakable.

Back in my dating days (pre-marriage bliss), I was that interested dude who spotted a woman across the room, heart racing, but froze. Smiled back? Eye contact? To me, it screamed ""maybe polite, maybe not."" I walked away thinking ""she's not into it,"" only to hear later from friends she thought I was the standoffish one. Sound familiar? That old line – ""If he's into you, he'll make the move"" – feels empowering, but it's half-baked. It ignores the fear, the signals we misread, and the world post-#MeToo where ""approach"" can mean ""creep"" in seconds. Spoiler: Real interest needs a two-way street, or you both end up solo with ""what ifs.""

I learned this the hard way chasing one-sided vibes (texts flying, but no real spark), and it left me burned. But flipping it? Landed me connections that stuck. Here's my no-BS advice for dodging those misses – for guys and gals:

**For Guys:** Read the Room, But Don't Wait for a Billboard

**- Start low-stakes:** Comment on something shared (e.g., ""That book's a game-changer – fan of the series?""). It's approach without ambush.

**- Gauge response:** If she leans in or asks back, green light. Short reply? Graceful exit – no ego bruise.

\- Own the fear: Rejection's 90% ""bad timing,"" not you. Practice on baristas; builds that muscle.

**For Women:** Signals Aren't Mind-Reading – Make 'Em Clear

**- Go direct-lite:** Smile + ""Hey, love your vibe – what's your story?"" Turns passive wait into active invite.

**- Reciprocate fast:** If he chats, match energy (questions, laughs). It screams ""interested"" louder than a wink.

**- Ditch the passive:** Apps are great, but IRL? A ""grab coffee?"" from you filters the bold from the benchwarmers.

**Bottom line:** Interest isn't a solo sprint – it's a mutual nudge. I wasted years overthinking signals; now? My wife approached \*me\* at a coffee shop with a simple ""Rough day?"" We clicked because she bridged the gap. Don't let myths keep you sidelined – step in, or step up.

What's your biggest ""missed signal"" story, and how'd you fix it next time? Share below – let's swap wins.

**TL;DR:** ""He'll approach if interested"" ignores fears and mixed cues – advice: Guys, low-stakes openers; women, clear reciprocation. Mutual effort builds real sparks.

1oiw39j,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1oiw39j/so_i_wrote_an_essay_about_why_tipping_should_end/,So I wrote an essay about why tipping should end for my final assignment in my college writing class.,"I spend about a week researching the practice of tipping and wrote an essay I'm pretty proud of so I thought I'd share it as it pretty well covers my thoughts on the matter. As you can see it's a long read but it's there IF you want to read it discuss it with me.

  
**A Modest Proposal: Let's Just Pay People for Their Jobs**

We’ve all been there, ordering food and wondering why everything costs so much just to see the dreaded iPad swivel. The digital screen asks you how much extra money you want to spend for zero additional benefits. Turns out it didn’t end there because the store also has a 15% carry out surcharge and a 12% employee benefits surcharge. You’re a good person, right? You obviously want everyone to be able to eat and live so of course you tip the max suggested amount which is 30% and now you’re already overpriced $6 dollar coffee is $9.42. Don’t worry though because you’ll also get the option to round up to $10 for the server or a random cause you’ve never heard of.

 

So now you take your $10 small coffee and open Uber to get a ride to work. When placing the order you now get asked to “pretip” before you’ve even gotten the service. You think to yourself isn’t a tip supposed to be a reward for good service? Tipping before I’ve even received the service seems to negate the driver’s desire to do a good job and receive a tip. Well don’t worry because you’ll be asked to tip again after the ride is over and when you ask the driver about it, he tells you the “pretip” isn’t a tip but a “bid for service”. You must pay for service from the app and then pay to get a driver to do his job and then pay again to thank him for providing the service you’ve already paid for.

 

If this sounds crazy to you like a predatory practice that has spiraled out of control you wouldn’t be alone. What I’d like to argue here is that tipping hurts the customer, the employee, and isn’t always a benefit for the owner either. I believe tipping is a net negative for society and creates a customer base that doesn’t want to use tipped services, an employee wage that’s unstable and allows for discrimination, and an owner who’s wondering why he’s getting less customers in his business.

 

The first victim of the American tipping system is the customer, who is forced to navigate a practice rooted not in generosity, but in a history of exploiting labor. While many assume tipping has always been an American custom, it was widely rejected before the Civil War. It was only adopted after emancipation when employers largely in the hospitality industry sought to avoid paying wages to newly freed black Americans. By forcing this workforce to rely entirely on customer gratuities, they effectively transferred the cost of labor from the business to the customer. It seems that while we’ve long since abolished slavery, this system designed to exploit labor has remained and in recent years even flourished.

 

This foundational decision to burden the customer with paying the employee's wage has spiraled into the modern crisis of ""Tipflation."" The constant rising cost of goods is now compounded by this added and expanding fee creating a situation of ""tip fatigue"" for the customer. They see a simple act like getting a coffee as a luxury they might not be able to afford. It isn’t just the rising percentage of tips but also the sheer number of places adopting the practice. According to the Pew Research Center, 72% of Americans say that tipping is expected in more places today than it was five years ago (DeSilver & Lippert, 2023). Tipping used to be reserved for a sit-down meal or a pizza delivery. Now, it seems every business has the ""dreaded iPad swivel,"" even if the business is largely self-serve and the customer does most of the work themself.

 

Beyond the direct financial hit of ""Tipflation,"" the system causes a heavy psychological burden on the customer. The ""iPad swivel"" turns every simple transaction into a moment of social anxiety. What was once a voluntary reward for exceptional service has become a forced practice enforced by a pre-set 30% option (Conlin et al., 2003). This removes any sense of actual generosity and replaces it with resentment and a feeling like they’ve been ripped off. This distortion is most apparent in the rise of the ""pre-tip"" on delivery and rideshare apps. As mentioned in the introduction, this is often not a ""tip"" at all but a ""bid for service,"" a fee required to ensure a driver will even accept the order. The customer is now in the absurd position of paying for the service, bidding for a worker to perform that service, and then being asked to tip *again* after the service is complete.

 

Looking at how much the customer loses from the practice of tipping, surely the employee must benefit right? Turns out it doesn’t help them much either. It traps employees into many situations where they can suffer from financial instability and discrimination. In most states the wage of tipped employees is $2.13 an hour and after taxes can result in a check with zero currency on it. It makes the employees entirely dependent on the customer to earn a living wage, which is why I believe the practice of tipping has become more predatory and in more places over the last few years. The wage paid by the employer could never be used to live on by the employee so the tip amount must forcibly be increased due to rising cost of living and tips being the only income the employee has.

 

Tipping can also fluctuate wildly based on discrimination by gender, age, and attractiveness (Azar, 2020). An attractive younger employee might make considerably more at the same position than someone older or less attractive. Without a system in place to make sure both employees earn a livable wage some people simply might not even be able to do tipped roles due to them not being able to make enough to live. 

 

Finally, this system can create a negative power dynamic that leads directly to workplace harassment. Because the customer is the main source of income, the employee is often forced to tolerate inappropriate and abusive behavior to protect their income. An employee who pushes back against a rude or suggestive comment risks losing the tip they need to pay their bills. This effectively holds the worker's income hostage, forcing them to endure conditions from casual disrespect to overt sexual harassment and would be unacceptable in a non-tipped profession (Ross & Welsh, 2023).

 

If tipping hurts the customer and the employee, surely the owner must be thrilled with the savings on labor costs? This is only a perceived benefit, as the truth is that the owner often doesn't gain in the long run. The “tipflation” crisis has led many Americans to feel that tipping is ""out of control"" (Kelly, 2023) and creates significant customer resentment. This widespread fatigue and confusion confirmed by the Pew Research Center (DeSilver & Lippert, 2023) can eventually lead to customers dining out less. This will directly hurt the owner's revenue and could possibly even lead to layoffs or bankruptcy.

 

Furthermore, the tipping system is an administrative and legal nightmare. Managing the $2.13 ""tip credit"" wage is a complex tracking burden for businesses. Legally, if an employee's tips do not add up to the full minimum wage for a pay period, the employer is responsible for paying the difference. Failure to track this perfectly opens the owner to massive wage theft lawsuits (Margalioth, 2006-2007). For a small business the legal fees and damages from such a lawsuit could be devastating and even lead to the business closing.

 

Finally, tipping creates staffing and morale problems. It establishes a disparity between the ""front of house"" (servers) who receive tips, and the ""back of house"" (kitchen staff) who often don't despite their essential role. This disparity breeds resentment and makes it difficult to foster a team environment which can damage the quality of both food and service. An income based on $2.13 + tips is unstable and can lead to high employee turnover. This forces the owner to spend time and money on hiring and training new employees which will eat away at any perceived savings from the tip credit.

 

Tipping is far from being a simple bonus for good service and is often revealed to be a dysfunctional and predatory model that survives by pitting its three participants against each other. It exploits the customer, who is forced to subsidize an employer's payroll while navigating a confusing and expanding landscape of ""tipflation."" It actively harms the employees, locking them into a less than livable wage that fosters instability, invites discrimination based on race and appearance, and creates a power dynamic that could include workplace harassment. It also ultimately deceives the owner who in exchange for the illusion of lower labor costs is saddled with alienated customers, significant legal exposure, and a potential high turnover work environment.

 

The solution is not a better calculator or a new surcharge. The solution is to finally abandon the exploitative system adopted after the Civil War and end the legal fiction of the ""tip credit."" It is time to return the responsibility of paying a stable and livable wage to the employer. The solution is in fact the modest proposal this essay began with: Let's just pay people for their jobs.",15,1761714870.0,EndTipping,7,0.94,False

AITAH?","Hello, I am F (18) and my roommate is also F (18). we will call her 2. Basically we just moved together for college. A couple weeks ago I arrived back home with my trash on the floor in the main area (the one space we share we have separate rooms) that was dug out of the trash we both use by her. I then texted 2 about it and asked if next time she could set my trash to the side, even though it was a shared trash. she then proceeds to call me lazy and gross for how I live. All I did was put my trash in the trash. I recognize that I may be a little messy but this was over trash that was already in the trash. after about two-ish week she texted me about ""deep cleaning"" the main area. 2 then proceeds too text me asking if I wanted my towels washed that were hanging up, I said no at first but she insisted so I let it go (I was not home at this time). I come back home the next day and find out she left my towels in the washer for the entire day and they were all stiff and just felt weird. 2 then told me she used my towels to clean the bathroom. she never asked and was planning on not telling me. I told her to just ask next time. Fast forward a week, and she sends me a text starting with ""I bought you a container for your stuff on the counter, so I'm honestly confused why it's not being used for that."" I did not ask her to buy this container. mind you there was a jar for my toothpaste and toothbrush by my sink and some skincare items. We have two sinks, one for me and one for her. 2 sends me a long text of things she expects from me because of how ""gross"" I live. She told me that she is the only one that ever cleans and I have no respect for others. I sent a text back telling her that we pay the same amount to live in the same space. I also mentioned how I do clean up after myself. I clean the microwave, the bathroom, my side of the sink, and more when she's gone. If she decides to clean my side because she wants to deep clean that is her choice in my opinion. on top of this, if I leave anything by my side of the sink, she will go over and rearrange my things to the way she's likes it. I do not like conflict and have been trying to remain peaceful but it seems like anything I do in our shared area she gets mad about. 2 can have her stuff out but its a problem when my stuff is out and it doesn't seem fair to me. along with that, she is quite hypocritical when it comes to having guests over. We both agreed that we can have people over just as long as the people are quiet by a certain hour. When 2 has people over It doesn't bother me or anything I just keep doing what I'm doing. I live pretty close to my friends, so I don't have them over much, but when I do she turns her TV up very loud o where other rooms can hear it. She also told me I need to ask her permission anytime I have people over. I feel that is double standards but it may not be. to add, during the time she was ignoring me she would randomly text asking if she could get free coffee from my work.

As the dark clouds rolled in, I headed indoors to rest. I closed the door and dropped my wet jacket on the ground. I grabbed the tea pot, put some water in, and placed it on the stove. I turned on the stove, and the flame sparked for a bit before it ignited. 



I sat down on my sofa and placed my phone down. Not even seconds after putting it down, I received a text message. I picked up the phone and saw that it was from somebody that I couldn't care less about, so I placed it back down. 



Then it happened again. 



I grabbed my phone with a sigh, thinking that it was the same damn person, but it wasn't. I looked at the text, puzzled for a second. It was from an unknown number. The thought of that scared me halfway to death. 



""You know what you have to do,"" the text read. 



The words felt familiar somehow, like an echo from a conversation I'd tried to forget. I looked back at the stove to see if the tea was finished, but nothing. The water sat still, refusing to bubble. I looked back at my phone and laughed it off as I leaned my head against the sofa and drifted off.



\---



My phone went off again. I looked at the text, and it said, ""Time's ticking, pal."" 



I got up from the sofa and started to walk around, from the kitchen to the living room, passing around the sofa. Something felt off about the apartment, like the angles were slightly wrong. I checked on the tea again and realized that it was still not boiling yet. Strange—it had been on for what felt like twenty minutes.



I started thinking to myself, wondering where the hell these texts were coming from. I went over to the window inside my apartment and moved the blinds over to get a better look outside. I saw nothing but more dark clouds rolling in. 



Then it began. The rain started to pour in. I could hear the raindrops smacking against my roof. 



I closed the blinds, and right as I was going to sit down on my sofa, my phone went off again. The same text appeared: ""Time's ticking, pal."" 



The text made me angry. I started gritting my teeth and breathing heavily. The words felt like an accusation, like someone knew what I'd done. What I'd failed to do. I threw the phone back on the table and began angrily walking around my sofa. The thoughts started to get to me: Who the hell is this person? What do they want? Do they know about her?



I tried to lay down and calm myself. I started to get cozy and began to slowly drift off again.



\---



As I was beginning to drift off, my phone went off again. I hesitantly reached over and grabbed it. I went to the messages and saw that it was from the person I had ignored in the first place. 



The message read, ""Are you okay?""



I smirked at the message and put my phone back down on the table. If only they knew how far from okay I was. I got up from the sofa to check on the tea, and it still had not come to a boil. The water remained eerily still despite the flame licking the bottom of the pot. I sighed and then headed into the restroom.



I looked into the mirror and saw a reflection of all my friends. I laughed to myself and said, ""What friends?"" 



As I turned on the water to my sink and began washing my face, I heard a cracking sound. I looked back up at the mirror. I saw that it was beginning to shatter, and I became puzzled at the sight of my mirror cracking. Fine lines spread across the surface like a web. I thought nothing of it and continued washing my face, wondering why the mirror was cracking. 



The more I had the water on, the more I kept hearing this cracking sound. I turned the water off and looked back at the mirror—it seemed to be perfectly fine. No cracks. No lines. Perfect.



I laughed at the sight of the seemingly perfect mirror, shut off the light in the bathroom, and headed out to the living room, closing the bathroom door behind me. 



I looked into the kitchen and saw that the tea had still not boiled. I walked over to the sofa but noticed that my wet jacket was on it. I glared at the jacket and said to myself, ""How did you get there?"" 



I thought nothing of it—my mind had been playing tricks lately—and grabbed the jacket to hang it back up. When I turned around, I saw my sofa turned completely to the opposite side from where I had it. The coffee table had shifted too, ninety degrees from its original position.



I became baffled at the sight of my couch but ended up laughing it off as I lay back down on it. The laugh came out wrong, hollow.



\---



As I began to slowly fall asleep, I felt a vibration sensation on the lower part of my body and woke up to realize that my phone was on my pants, vibrating. How had it gotten there? I picked it up and saw that I was being called by an unknown number. 



I thought to myself, ""Now they're calling?"" 



I answered the phone hesitantly and said, ""Who are you?""



I got no answer at all for almost a minute. Just breathing. Then—



""You know what you have to do,"" a mysterious voice said.



The voice sounded like mine. Like an echo of my own thoughts.



Before I could even reply, the phone cut off, and I knew the person had hung up on me. I sat up and got off my sofa with my phone in my hand, clinging to it as I began to walk around my apartment. 



I traveled into my bathroom again and saw that there was a crack in the mirror, just like before. This time I was certain. The crack ran right through where my face would be. I shook my head and closed the door again.



I went back over to the stove and saw that the flame was still on, but the water was still not boiling. Hours now, and nothing. I became frustrated and opened my fridge to see what I had to eat. Not much, so I closed the fridge and turned around.



The teapot was on the counter next to the kitchen sink.



I stared at the teapot, confused, and put it back on the stove, laughing. The laugh sounded manic even to me. I went over to my living room and saw that the sofa had turned a complete one hundred eighty degrees, and so had the table. 



I laughed it off and sat back down on my sofa with my phone still in my hand. I looked at it with a bit of anger and confusion before putting it on the table. I lay back down, looking at my phone, wondering if someone was trying to kill me. Or if I was trying to kill myself. I laughed that idea off and began to drift off again.



\---



I awakened to droppings hitting my face. My first thought was that it could be leaking from my ceiling because of the rain. I decided to go up into the attic to check it out. 



With my flashlight in hand, I looked around and saw nothing. No leakage at all, and it baffled me. I turned off my flashlight and went back downstairs to investigate.



There was a puddle of what looked like water, but it was dark, almost like ink. I went over to the sofa and examined the liquid substance. As I went to touch it, I felt a burning sensation and pulled away. I was shocked beyond belief. 



I went to the bathroom again to look in the mirror and saw that most of my face had burn marks. I was petrified at my own reflection, my eyes nearly popping out of their sockets. This time I couldn't laugh it off. Every time I went to touch the marks, they would disappear without a trace and then come right back as if they were never gone.



I turned away from the mirror, exited the bathroom, and headed toward the sofa. When I came back, I froze. The bizarre dark liquid had disappeared, left no trace. I started grabbing and poking at the area where the pool of dark liquid had been, and yet it felt bone dry. 



I went over to the left side of my sofa where the dripping began and pushed against it to move the sofa from the center to the right side of my living room. Once I felt secure, I laid back down on the sofa and closed my eyes.

when formal recruitment was happening, i ended up dropping because i got so overwhelmed — everyone kept telling me that my major would take over my life and i wouldn’t have enough time to actually be involved in the chapter. fast forward to like two days ago, one of my old friends asked me to grab coffee and catch up. ofc i said yes, and we went this morning.

at first, she was talking a lot about her house — their philanthropy, follies, the living situation, all that — and she actually convinced me to sign up for spring COB (i haven’t submitted my registration form yet, but i’m planning to). i just need a little reassurance before i go through with it <3

anyway, back to the story. one of my other friends (different sorority than hers) told me she saw some members getting hazed, and idk how it came up, but i mentioned it during our conversation. after that, things got a little awkward and tense until we finished our coffee. then tonight, i found out she’s actually a recruiter for her house… which just so happens to be the house i’ve wanted from the start.

so like… did i totally ruin my chances? i hope i didn’t mention something i wasn’t supposed to. :(

(also from my knowledge and what i have been told from like literally everyone i’ve spoken to, her house does not haze.)",2,1761714386.0,Sororities,3,1.0,False

I’m from South America and recently moved to Shanghai — it’s been about two weeks! I’ll be here for quite a while, but I’m still getting to know the city. I’m here on a spouse visa since we moved because of my wife’s job.

I’d love to explore the city, make new friends, and build some local connections. If anyone’s up for grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, or discovering cool spots around Shanghai, feel free to DM me or add me on WeChat!

I’m also building a gaming PC — I already have some parts ordered but still need to get a few more and assemble everything. If you know a good place to buy components or get help with the build, I’d really appreciate your advice!

A bit about me: I’m into gaming, anime, history, and politics — and I’m pretty good at talking about all of them! I’m very friendly and always up for a good chat. I speak English fluently and I’m learning Mandarin, so I’d love to practice while exploring and meeting new people. 😄

1oivv1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/1oivv1y/started_building_a_twitch_overlay_hyperfocused/,"Started building a Twitch overlay, hyperfocused into an AI system instead. Classic ADHD.","**The ADHD Problem:**

You know that feeling when you're hyperfocused on solving a problem, and your brain goes:

*""Let's just skip the tests and ship it!""*  
*""This quick fix will save so much time!""*  
*""I'll refactor the entire codebase tonight!""*

And then 3 hours later you're like... ""Why did I think that was a good idea?""

**Or when you're frustrated:**

* Small problems feel catastrophic
* You abandon good solutions for quick hacks
* You can't tell if you're overthinking or underthinking

**Or when anxiety kicks in:**

* You spiral into complexity that didn't need to exist
* Simple problems become 12-step plans

**I needed an AI that would tell me: ""Hey, you're hyperfocusing on a bad idea. Here's why. Here are better options.""**

Not an AI that just agrees with me. An AI that **challenges me when I need it.**

**What I Built:**

An AI that learns MY patterns:

* When I tend to cut corners (hyperfocus)
* When I overthink simple problems (anxiety)
* What mistakes I've made before
* How I communicate best
* What analogies actually help me understand things

**Example from my actual test logs:**

**Me (hyperfocused):** ""Let's just hardcode this API key for now""

**AI Response:**

>

**It didn't just say ""that's bad.""** It:

1. Showed me MY pattern (I've done this before)
2. Used MY background (warehouse logistics) to explain why
3. Gave me specific alternatives that match how I think
4. Used my casual tone (""Bro, let's troubleshoot this"")

**Here's the weird part:**

**The same AI gave completely different responses to other users for the SAME risky decision:**

**Test User 2 (Homemaker, interested in recipes/cooking):**

>

**Test User 3 (Interested in anime, history, crime):**

>

**Same security problem. Same AI system. Three completely different explanations based on what each person cares about.**

The system learned:

* I'm a warehouse logistics guy who uses ""bro"" and thinks in shipping manifests
* User 2 is a homemaker who relates to cooking and recipes
* User 3 likes anime, history, and detective stories

**And it adapted its entire response style and analogies to match.**

**The ""Built in a Cave with Scraps"" Part:**

Here's the thing that still feels surreal to me:

**This project started because I was trying to make a Twitch overlay.**

No, seriously.

I was doing LinkedIn Learning courses on Python and AI because I was curious. Around the same time, my son wanted me to try streaming video games on Twitch. I tried it, but hated all the existing overlays.

So I thought: ""I'll just make my own!""

Started using Copilot and ChatGPT to help build it. But I kept hitting prompt limits. Photo generation limits. Rate limits everywhere.

**My ADHD brain went: ""Wait. What if I just ran this locally so there ARE no limits?""**

Started researching local AI models. Fell down the rabbit hole of Ollama, model orchestration, how to make AI remember context...

And then my hyperfocus completely shifted.

**I never finished the Twitch overlay.**

Instead, I built an entire AI personality system that learns how you think and challenges your bad decisions.

**Classic ADHD move:** Start one project, end up building something completely different that you didn't even know you needed.

It's like that scene in Iron Man where Obadiah Stane yells:

>

Except my cave was my basement. My scraps were:

* Free local AI models (Ollama) - because I got tired of API rate limits
* SQLite (free database) - because I know SQL from work
* ChatGPT and Claude (to help me write code I was learning as I went)
* 10 years of warehouse experience - ""wait, emotional tracking is just inventory management""
* An ADHD brain - ""what if I just tried this crazy thing?""

**I was learning Python WHILE building this.** I started Python 4 months ago. I built this system in the last 2 months.

I was Googling ""how do async functions work in Python"" while building an async multi-model AI orchestration system.

**I didn't know what I was doing. I just couldn't stop doing it.**

**My Background (for context):**

* 10+ years warehouse logistics (forklift trainer → shipping supervisor → logistics analyst)
* Started as a ""low-level warehouse tech"" (that's what they called me)
* Self-taught SQL (2-3 years), self-taught Python (4 months)
* ADHD (obviously)
* Sole income for family of 5
* Built this with AI help (ChatGPT/Claude as coding partners)
* **No computer science degree. No bootcamp. Just warehouse experience and ADHD pattern recognition.**

**The ADHD Superpower Part:**

People keep asking me: *""How did you build this so fast with no experience?""*

**The answer is ADHD hyperfocus + getting really annoyed at API rate limits.**

The same brain that:

* Started a Twitch overlay project and never finished it
* Can't sit through a 30-minute meeting without fidgeting
* Jumps from project to project

**Is the SAME brain that:**

* Saw ""rate limits are annoying"" and hyperfocused into ""build an entire local AI system""
* Connected ""warehouse inventory management"" and ""AI emotional tracking"" as **the same problem**
* Coded for 12 hours straight, 6 days a week, for 2 months because I **couldn't stop thinking about it**

**I didn't succeed despite my ADHD. I succeeded BECAUSE of it.**

The hyperfocus. The ""I'm annoyed at this limitation so I'll build my own solution"" energy. The pattern recognition that sees connections nobody else sees.

**That's not a bug. That's the feature.**

**Why I'm Telling You This:**

Because for years, people told me:

* ""You can't focus""
* ""You start things and don't finish them""
* ""You're just a warehouse guy""

And they were right. **I didn't finish the Twitch overlay.**

But I built something way more interesting instead.

**ADHD isn't about finishing what you started. It's about following where your brain wants to go—even if it's completely sideways from where you thought you were headed.**

A kid from nowhere, in a basement, learning Python from LinkedIn courses, who got annoyed at API rate limits while trying to make a video game overlay...

...accidentally built an AI system that adapts to how people think.

**That's the most ADHD origin story ever. And I'm not even mad about the unfinished overlay anymore.**

**What This Could Mean for ADHD Folks:**

Imagine an AI that:

**Knows when you're hyperfocusing on the wrong thing:**

* ""You've been stuck on this problem for 3 hours. Last time this happened, you were overthinking. Want to talk through it?""

**Catches impulsive decisions before they happen:**

* ""You're about to \[risky thing\]. You've done this before when frustrated. Here's what happened last time. Still sure?""

**Adapts to how YOUR brain works:**

* If you learn through analogies → uses analogies
* If you need step-by-step → gives you steps
* If you need blunt honesty → tells you straight
* If you need empathy → supportive tone

**Remembers your patterns so you don't have to:**

* ""Last Tuesday you said you work best in the morning. It's 11pm. Should you really start this now?""

**The Bigger Question:**

**Could this help with neurotypical translation?**

One thing I'm exploring: What if this could help explain neurotypical social stuff in ADHD-friendly terms?

Like:

* ""When they said 'we should grab coffee sometime,' they meant \[social ritual, not literal invite\]""
* ""You're being direct because that's how you communicate. Here's how to say that in neurotypical-speak without masking: \[alternative phrasing\]""

**I don't know if this is possible yet. But the architecture could support it.**

**Why I'm Posting This Here:**

**I need a reality check from people who GET it:**

1. **Would you actually USE this?** Or is this solving a problem that doesn't exist?
2. **Is tracking emotional patterns helpful or creepy?** The system learns that I tend to make reckless decisions when frustrated. It warns me: ""Your frustration baseline shifted. Want to talk about what's going on?"" **Helpful accountability? Or AI becoming a patronizing parent?**
3. **Would this actually help with ADHD challenges?** Or am I projecting my needs onto everyone else?
4. **The neurotypical translation thing—is that helpful or offensive?** Would you want an AI that helps you navigate neurotypical interactions without masking?

**I'm Not Selling Anything (Yet):**

This is built on local AI models (free, runs on my PC). No cloud. No subscription. All your data stays on your computer.

I just want to know: **Does this solve a real problem for ADHD brains? Or did I build something only I need?**

**Final Thought:**

**For years, people told me ADHD was a limitation.**

Turns out, the same brain that can't sit through a boring meeting is the same brain that can:

* See patterns between warehouse management and AI architecture
* Hyperfocus for 2 months straight to build a working system
* Connect dots that ""real developers"" with CS degrees miss

**ADHD isn't broken. We just need tools designed for how OUR brains actually work.**

**Is this one of those tools? Or am I just really good at convincing myself of things when hyperfocused?**

Tell me the truth. I can handle it. (That's what the AI is for.)

**TL;DR:**  
Started building a Twitch overlay, got annoyed at API rate limits, hyperfocused into building an AI system that challenges my impulsive ADHD decisions. It learns my warehouse background and uses shipping analogies to explain security risks. Gave 3 different test users completely different responses (warehouse/recipes/anime) for the same problem. Built it in 2 months while learning Python. Is this actually useful for ADHD brains or did I just hyperfocus on something nobody needs?",0,1761714038.0,ADHD_Programmers,0,0.5,False

I open my eyes, my dad standing beside my bed, a cup of coffee in his muscular tan hands. It happened again. I know that look on his face, the look of him having a late night, I must’ve been screaming all night. “You start school today, sorry kid.” He walks out of my room, leaving me to stare at the ceiling. I drag myself out of bed, stretching as I roll out of bed. My stomach rumbles, signaling my need for food. 



My mum became food for someone, they said she tasted like metallic silver. They put a dagger straight through her heart as they drained her blood. The autopsy said it was a vampire, shards of glass trapped inside her chest, I saw it all that day. I never got to tell her what I needed to say, she haunts my nightmares as if she owns my mind. My neighbours sometimes hear me scream, every time they hear, the next day they bring cookies.



I sit on the edge of the bed, staring at my new uniform. Ralantis school, this is my fourth school this year. My stained white long sleeve shirt, bite marks covering my arms, I wrap bandages around my arms. I’ve only ever seen pictures of the school, its truly nothing special.

1oivu1i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oivu1i,Advice needed on whether my home is suitable to list,"I'm trying to figure out whether to sign up for trusted House Sitters as a homeowner. Would you take a sit by the beach with cats who sometimes poop outside the litterbox? 

I have two black cats who are sisters and who are very sweet and loving. Over the past year, when I've traveled, one of the kitties has started pooping on my couch. She doesn't do this when I'm here, ever. She doesn't have anything medical wrong with her, according to the vet. It appears to be a stress reaction. Neither of them ever pee outside the litterbox. I'm not sure what more I can do to fix it, as it doesn't happen when I'm present, they've been to the vet, and I've tried different foods without any change. 

I've kept a cover on the couch and I have a washer/dryer for easy cleanup. 

The house itself is in Pacific Grove, California, in close walking distance of a grocery, restaurants, coffee shops, a bookstore, our small town theater, and the beach. I see otters and harbor seals every day and the beach and Lover’s Point is just down the road in easy strolling distance. The house is a two bedroom single family home with two bathrooms, a dishwasher, a washer dryer, wifi, Netflix without ads, and an electric car charger in the driveway. A bike and an ebike are included in the sit. It's possible to bike from my home and along the recreation trail to go whale watching year-round, we always have humpbacks in the Monterey Bay, or to visit the aquarium. About a half a mile uphill, there’s a trader joe’s, a lucky, and a safeway. It's a super safe town. You can also walk to a bus line that can take you through Monterey and further afield. The recreation trail goes many miles up the coast and I live within a 5 minute bike ride of 17 mile drive and the monarch butterfly sanctuary.

The cats are chill (except the poop) and can hang out with each other much of the time, if there are sitters who need to be out for the whole day. 

So, given that I have unavoidable travel this coming year that I simply cannot get out of, do you think anyone would take this sit?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I made a post about six months ago sharing my experience after a week of hardcore use with Claude Code. It's now been about six months of hardcore use, and I would like to share some more tips, tricks, and word vomit with you all. I may have went a little overboard here so strap in, grab a coffee, sit on the toilet or whatever it is you do when doom-scrolling reddit.

I want to start the post off with a disclaimer: all the content within this post is merely me sharing what setup is working best for me currently and should not be taken as gospel or the only correct way to do things. It's meant to hopefully inspire you to improve your setup and workflows with AI agentic coding. I'm just a guy, and this is just like, my opinion, man.

Also, I'm on the 20x Max plan, so your mileage may vary. And if you're looking for vibe-coding tips, you should look elsewhere. If you want the best out of CC, then you should be working together with it: planning, reviewing, iterating, exploring different approaches, etc.

# Quick Overview

After 6 months of pushing Claude Code to its limits (solo rewriting 300k LOC), here's the system I built:

* Skills that actually auto-activate when needed
* Dev docs workflow that prevents Claude from losing the plot
* PM2 + hooks for zero-errors-left-behind
* Army of specialized agents for reviews, testing, and planning Let's get into it.

# Background

I'm a software engineer who has been working on production web apps for the last seven years or so. And I have fully embraced the wave of AI with open arms. I'm not too worried about AI taking my job anytime soon, as it is a tool that I use to leverage my capabilities. In doing so, I have been building MANY new features and coming up with all sorts of new proposal presentations put together with Claude and GPT-5 Thinking to integrate new AI systems into our production apps. Projects I would have never dreamt of having the time to even consider before integrating AI into my workflow. And with all that, I'm giving myself a good deal of job security and have become the AI guru at my job since everyone else is about a year or so behind on how they're integrating AI into their day-to-day.

With my newfound confidence, I proposed a pretty large redesign/refactor of one of our web apps used as an internal tool at work. This was a pretty rough college student-made project that was forked off another project developed by me as an intern (created about 7 years ago and forked 4 years ago). This may have been a bit overly ambitious of me since, to sell it to the stakeholders, I agreed to finish a top-down redesign of this fairly decent-sized project (\~100k LOC) in a matter of two to three months...all by myself. I knew going in that I was going to have to put in extra hours to get this done, even with the help of CC. But deep down, I know it's going to be a hit, automating several manual processes and saving a lot of time for a lot of people at the company.

It's now six months later... yeah, I probably should not have agreed to this timeline. I have tested the limits of both Claude as well as my own sanity trying to get this thing done. I completely scrapped the old frontend, as everything was seriously outdated and I wanted to play with the latest and greatest. I'm talkin' React 16 JS → React 19 TypeScript, React Query v2 → TanStack Query v5, React Router v4 w/ hashrouter → TanStack Router w/ file-based routing, Material UI v4 → MUI v7, all with strict adherence to best practices. The project is now at \~300-400k LOC and my life expectancy \~5 years shorter. It's finally ready to put up for testing, and I am incredibly happy with how things have turned out.

This used to be a project with insurmountable tech debt, ZERO test coverage, HORRIBLE developer experience (testing things was an absolute nightmare), and all sorts of jank going on. I addressed all of those issues with decent test coverage, manageable tech debt, and implemented a command-line tool for generating test data as well as a dev mode to test different features on the frontend. During this time, I have gotten to know CC's abilities and what to expect out of it.

# A Note on Quality and Consistency

I've noticed a recurring theme in forums and discussions - people experiencing frustration with usage limits and concerns about output quality declining over time. I want to be clear up front: I'm not here to dismiss those experiences or claim it's simply a matter of ""doing it wrong."" Everyone's use cases and contexts are different, and valid concerns deserve to be heard.

That said, I want to share what's been working for me. In my experience, CC's output has actually improved significantly over the last couple of months, and I believe that's largely due to the workflow I've been constantly refining. My hope is that if you take even a small bit of inspiration from my system and integrate it into your CC workflow, you'll give it a better chance at producing quality output that you're happy with.

Now, let's be real - there are absolutely times when Claude completely misses the mark and produces suboptimal code. This can happen for various reasons. First, AI models are stochastic, meaning you can get widely varying outputs from the same input. Sometimes the randomness just doesn't go your way, and you get an output that's legitimately poor quality through no fault of your own. Other times, it's about how the prompt is structured. There can be significant differences in outputs given slightly different wording because the model takes things quite literally. If you misword or phrase something ambiguously, it can lead to vastly inferior results.

# Sometimes You Just Need to Step In

Look, AI is incredible, but it's not magic. There are certain problems where pattern recognition and human intuition just win. If you've spent 30 minutes watching Claude struggle with something that you could fix in 2 minutes, just fix it yourself. No shame in that. Think of it like teaching someone to ride a bike - sometimes you just need to steady the handlebars for a second before letting go again.

I've seen this especially with logic puzzles or problems that require real-world common sense. AI can brute-force a lot of things, but sometimes a human just ""gets it"" faster. Don't let stubbornness or some misguided sense of ""but the AI should do everything"" waste your time. Step in, fix the issue, and keep moving.

I've had my fair share of terrible prompting, which usually happens towards the end of the day where I'm getting lazy and I'm not putting that much effort into my prompts. And the results really show. So next time you are having these kinds of issues where you think the output is way worse these days because you think Anthropic shadow-nerfed Claude, I encourage you to take a step back and reflect on how you are prompting.

**Re-prompt often.** You can hit double-esc to bring up your previous prompts and select one to branch from. You'd be amazed how often you can get way better results armed with the knowledge of what you don't want when giving the same prompt. All that to say, there can be many reasons why the output quality seems to be worse, and it's good to self-reflect and consider what you can do to give it the best possible chance to get the output you want.

As some wise dude somewhere probably said, ""Ask not what Claude can do for you, ask what context you can give to Claude"" \~ Wise Dude

Alright, I'm going to step down from my soapbox now and get on to the good stuff.

# My System

I've implemented a lot changes to my workflow as it relates to CC over the last 6 months, and the results have been pretty great, IMO.

# Skills Auto-Activation System (Game Changer!)

This one deserves its own section because it completely transformed how I work with Claude Code.

# The Problem

So Anthropic releases this Skills feature, and I'm thinking ""this looks awesome!"" The idea of having these portable, reusable guidelines that Claude can reference sounded perfect for maintaining consistency across my massive codebase. I spent a good chunk of time with Claude writing up comprehensive skills for frontend development, backend development, database operations, workflow management, etc. We're talking thousands of lines of best practices, patterns, and examples.

And then... nothing. Claude just wouldn't use them. I'd literally use the exact keywords from the skill descriptions. Nothing. I'd work on files that should trigger the skills. Nothing. It was incredibly frustrating because I could see the potential, but the skills just sat there like expensive decorations.

# The ""Aha!"" Moment

That's when I had the idea of using **hooks**. If Claude won't automatically use skills, what if I built a system that MAKES it check for relevant skills before doing anything?

So I dove into Claude Code's hook system and built a multi-layered auto-activation architecture with TypeScript hooks. And it actually works!

# How It Works

I created two main hooks:

**1. UserPromptSubmit Hook** (runs BEFORE Claude sees your message):

* Analyzes your prompt for keywords and intent patterns
* Checks which skills might be relevant
* Injects a formatted reminder into Claude's context
* Now when I ask ""how does the layout system work?"" Claude sees a big ""🎯 SKILL ACTIVATION CHECK - Use project-catalog-developer skill"" (project catalog is a large complex data grid based feature on my front end) before even reading my question

**2. Stop Event Hook** (runs AFTER Claude finishes responding):

* Analyzes which files were edited
* Checks for risky patterns (try-catch blocks, database operations, async functions)
* Displays a gentle self-check reminder
* ""Did you add error handling? Are Prisma operations using the repository pattern?""
* Non-blocking, just keeps Claude aware without being annoying

# skill-rules.json Configuration

I created a central configuration file that defines every skill with:

* **Keywords**: Explicit topic matches (""layout"", ""workflow"", ""database"")
* **Intent patterns**: Regex to catch actions (""(create|add).\*?(feature|route)"")
* **File path triggers**: Activates based on what file you're editing
* **Content triggers**: Activates if file contains specific patterns (Prisma imports, controllers, etc.)

Example snippet:

    {
      ""backend-dev-guidelines"": {
        ""type"": ""domain"",
        ""enforcement"": ""suggest"",
        ""priority"": ""high"",
        ""promptTriggers"": {
          ""keywords"": [""backend"", ""controller"", ""service"", ""API"", ""endpoint""],
          ""intentPatterns"": [
            ""(create|add).*?(route|endpoint|controller)"",
            ""(how to|best practice).*?(backend|API)""
          ]
        },
        ""fileTriggers"": {
          ""pathPatterns"": [""backend/src/**/*.ts""],
          ""contentPatterns"": [""router\\."", ""export.*Controller""]
        }
      }
    }

# The Results

Now when I work on backend code, Claude automatically:

1. Sees the skill suggestion before reading my prompt
2. Loads the relevant guidelines
3. Actually follows the patterns consistently
4. Self-checks at the end via gentle reminders

**The difference is night and day.** No more inconsistent code. No more ""wait, Claude used the old pattern again."" No more manually telling it to check the guidelines every single time.

# Following Anthropic's Best Practices (The Hard Way)

After getting the auto-activation working, I dove deeper and found Anthropic's official best practices docs. Turns out I was doing it wrong because they recommend keeping the main SKILL.md file **under 500 lines** and using progressive disclosure with resource files.

Whoops. My frontend-dev-guidelines skill was 1,500+ lines. And I had a couple other skills over 1,000 lines. These monolithic files were defeating the whole purpose of skills (loading only what you need).

So I restructured everything:

* **frontend-dev-guidelines**: 398-line main file + 10 resource files
* **backend-dev-guidelines**: 304-line main file + 11 resource files

Now Claude loads the lightweight main file initially, and only pulls in detailed resource files when actually needed. Token efficiency improved 40-60% for most queries.

# Skills I've Created

Here's my current skill lineup:

**Guidelines & Best Practices:**

* `backend-dev-guidelines` \- Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories
* `frontend-dev-guidelines` \- React 19, MUI v7, TanStack Query/Router patterns
* `skill-developer` \- Meta-skill for creating more skills

**Domain-Specific:**

* `workflow-developer` \- Complex workflow engine patterns
* `notification-developer` \- Email/notification system
* `database-verification` \- Prevent column name errors (this one is a guardrail that actually blocks edits!)
* `project-catalog-developer` \- DataGrid layout system

All of these automatically activate based on what I'm working on. It's like having a senior dev who actually remembers all the patterns looking over Claude's shoulder.

# Why This Matters

Before skills + hooks:

* Claude would use old patterns even though I documented new ones
* Had to manually tell Claude to check BEST\_PRACTICES.md every time
* Inconsistent code across the 300k+ LOC codebase
* Spent too much time fixing Claude's ""creative interpretations""

After skills + hooks:

* Consistent patterns automatically enforced
* Claude self-corrects before I even see the code
* Can trust that guidelines are being followed
* Way less time spent on reviews and fixes

If you're working on a large codebase with established patterns, I cannot recommend this system enough. The initial setup took a couple of days to get right, but it's paid for itself ten times over.

# CLAUDE.md and Documentation Evolution

In a post I wrote 6 months ago, I had a section about rules being your best friend, which I still stand by. But my CLAUDE.md file was quickly getting out of hand and was trying to do too much. I also had this massive BEST\_PRACTICES.md file (1,400+ lines) that Claude would sometimes read and sometimes completely ignore.

So I took an afternoon with Claude to consolidate and reorganize everything into a new system. Here's what changed:

# What Moved to Skills

Previously, BEST\_PRACTICES.md contained:

* TypeScript standards
* React patterns (hooks, components, suspense)
* Backend API patterns (routes, controllers, services)
* Error handling (Sentry integration)
* Database patterns (Prisma usage)
* Testing guidelines
* Performance optimization

**All of that is now in skills** with the auto-activation hook ensuring Claude actually uses them. No more hoping Claude remembers to check BEST\_PRACTICES.md.

# What Stayed in CLAUDE.md

Now CLAUDE.md is laser-focused on **project-specific info** (only \~200 lines):

* Quick commands (`pnpm pm2:start`, `pnpm build`, etc.)
* Service-specific configuration
* Task management workflow (dev docs system)
* Testing authenticated routes
* Workflow dry-run mode
* Browser tools configuration

# The New Structure

    Root CLAUDE.md (100 lines)
    ├── Critical universal rules
    ├── Points to repo-specific claude.md files
    └── References skills for detailed guidelines
    
    Each Repo's claude.md (50-100 lines)
    ├── Quick Start section pointing to:
    │   ├── PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md - Architecture & integration
    │   ├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Common issues
    │   └── Auto-generated API docs
    └── Repo-specific quirks and commands

**The magic:** Skills handle all the ""how to write code"" guidelines, and CLAUDE.md handles ""how this specific project works."" Separation of concerns for the win.

# Dev Docs System

This system, out of everything (besides skills), I think has made the most impact on the results I'm getting out of CC. Claude is like an extremely confident junior dev with extreme amnesia, losing track of what they're doing easily. This system is aimed at solving those shortcomings.

The dev docs section from my CLAUDE.md:

    ### Starting Large Tasks
    
    When exiting plan mode with an accepted plan: 1.**Create Task Directory**:
    mkdir -p ~/git/project/dev/active/[task-name]/
    
    2.**Create Documents**:
    
    - `[task-name]-plan.md` - The accepted plan
    - `[task-name]-context.md` - Key files, decisions
    - `[task-name]-tasks.md` - Checklist of work
    
    3.**Update Regularly**: Mark tasks complete immediately
    
    ### Continuing Tasks
    
    - Check `/dev/active/` for existing tasks
    - Read all three files before proceeding
    - Update ""Last Updated"" timestamps

These are documents that always get created for every feature or large task. Before using this system, I had many times when I all of a sudden realized that Claude had lost the plot and we were no longer implementing what we had planned out 30 minutes earlier because we went off on some tangent for whatever reason.

# My Planning Process

My process starts with planning. **Planning is king**. If you aren't at a minimum using planning mode before asking Claude to implement something, you're gonna have a bad time, mmm'kay. You wouldn't have a builder come to your house and start slapping on an addition without having him draw things up first.

When I start planning a feature, I put it into planning mode, even though I will eventually have Claude write the plan down in a markdown file. I'm not sure putting it into planning mode necessary, but to me, it feels like planning mode gets better results doing the research on your codebase and getting all the correct context to be able to put together a plan.

I created a `strategic-plan-architect` subagent that's basically a planning beast. It:

* Gathers context efficiently
* Analyzes project structure
* Creates comprehensive structured plans with executive summary, phases, tasks, risks, success metrics, timelines
* Generates three files automatically: plan, context, and tasks checklist

But I find it really annoying that you can't see the agent's output, and even more annoying is if you say no to the plan, it just kills the agent instead of continuing to plan. So I also created a custom slash command (`/dev-docs`) with the same prompt to use on the main CC instance.

Once Claude spits out that beautiful plan, I take time to review it thoroughly. **This step is really important.** Take time to understand it, and you'd be surprised at how often you catch silly mistakes or Claude misunderstanding a very vital part of the request or task.

More often than not, I'll be at 15% context left or less after exiting plan mode. But that's okay because we're going to put everything we need to start fresh into our dev docs. Claude usually likes to just jump in guns blazing, so I immediately slap the ESC key to interrupt and run my `/create-dev-docs` slash command. The command takes the approved plan and creates all three files, sometimes doing a bit more research to fill in gaps if there's enough context left.

And once I'm done with that, I'm pretty much set to have Claude fully implement the feature without getting lost or losing track of what it was doing, even through an auto-compaction. I just make sure to remind Claude every once in a while to update the tasks as well as the context file with any relevant context. And once I'm running low on context in the current session, I just run my slash command `/update-dev-docs`. Claude will note any relevant context (with next steps) as well as mark any completed tasks or add new tasks before I compact the conversation. And all I need to say is ""continue"" in the new session.

During implementation, depending on the size of the feature or task, I will specifically tell Claude to only implement one or two sections at a time. That way, I'm getting the chance to go in and review the code in between each set of tasks. And periodically, I have a subagent also reviewing the changes so I can catch big mistakes early on. If you aren't having Claude review its own code, then I highly recommend it because it saved me a lot of headaches catching critical errors, missing implementations, inconsistent code, and security flaws.

# PM2 Process Management (Backend Debugging Game Changer)

This one's a relatively recent addition, but it's made debugging backend issues so much easier.

# The Problem

My project has seven backend microservices running simultaneously. The issue was that Claude didn't have access to view the logs while services were running. I couldn't just ask ""what's going wrong with the email service?"" - Claude couldn't see the logs without me manually copying and pasting them into chat.

# The Intermediate Solution

For a while, I had each service write its output to a timestamped log file using a `devLog` script. This worked... okay. Claude could read the log files, but it was clunky. Logs weren't real-time, services wouldn't auto-restart on crashes, and managing everything was a pain.

# The Real Solution: PM2

Then I discovered PM2, and it was a game changer. I configured all my backend services to run via PM2 with a single command: `pnpm pm2:start`

**What this gives me:**

* Each service runs as a managed process with its own log file
* **Claude can easily read individual service logs in real-time**
* Automatic restarts on crashes
* Real-time monitoring with `pm2 logs`
* Memory/CPU monitoring with `pm2 monit`
* Easy service management (`pm2 restart email`, `pm2 stop all`, etc.)

**PM2 Configuration:**

    // ecosystem.config.jsmodule.exports = {
      apps: [
        {
          name: 'form-service',
          script: 'npm',
          args: 'start',
          cwd: './form',
          error_file: './form/logs/error.log',
          out_file: './form/logs/out.log',
        },
    // ... 6 more services
      ]
    };

**Before PM2:**

    Me: ""The email service is throwing errors""
    Me: [Manually finds and copies logs]
    Me: [Pastes into chat]
    Claude: ""Let me analyze this...""

**The debugging workflow now:**

    Me: ""The email service is throwing errors""
    Claude: [Runs] pm2 logs email --lines 200
    Claude: [Reads the logs] ""I see the issue - database connection timeout...""
    Claude: [Runs] pm2 restart email
    Claude: ""Restarted the service, monitoring for errors...""

Night and day difference. Claude can autonomously debug issues now without me being a human log-fetching service.

**One caveat:** Hot reload doesn't work with PM2, so I still run the frontend separately with `pnpm dev`. But for backend services that don't need hot reload as often, PM2 is incredible.

# Hooks System (#NoMessLeftBehind)

The project I'm working on is multi-root and has about eight different repos in the root project directory. One for the frontend and seven microservices and utilities for the backend. I'm constantly bouncing around making changes in a couple of repos at a time depending on the feature.

And one thing that would annoy me to no end is when Claude forgets to run the build command in whatever repo it's editing to catch errors. And it will just leave a dozen or so TypeScript errors without me catching it. Then a couple of hours later I see Claude running a build script like a good boy and I see the output: ""There are several TypeScript errors, but they are unrelated, so we're all good here!""

No, we are not good, Claude.

# Hook #1: File Edit Tracker

First, I created a **post-tool-use hook** that runs after every Edit/Write/MultiEdit operation. It logs:

* Which files were edited
* What repo they belong to
* Timestamps

Initially, I made it run builds immediately after each edit, but that was stupidly inefficient. Claude makes edits that break things all the time before quickly fixing them.

# Hook #2: Build Checker

Then I added a **Stop hook** that runs when Claude finishes responding. It:

1. Reads the edit logs to find which repos were modified
2. Runs build scripts on each affected repo
3. Checks for TypeScript errors
4. If < 5 errors: Shows them to Claude
5. If ≥ 5 errors: Recommends launching auto-error-resolver agent
6. Logs everything for debugging

Since implementing this system, I've not had a single instance where Claude has left errors in the code for me to find later. The hook catches them immediately, and Claude fixes them before moving on.

# Hook #3: Prettier Formatter

This one's simple but effective. After Claude finishes responding, automatically format all edited files with Prettier using the appropriate `.prettierrc` config for that repo.

No more going into to manually edit a file just to have prettier run and produce 20 changes because Claude decided to leave off trailing commas last week when we created that file.

# Hook #4: Error Handling Reminder

This is the gentle philosophy hook I mentioned earlier:

* Analyzes edited files after Claude finishes
* Detects risky patterns (try-catch, async operations, database calls, controllers)
* Shows a gentle reminder if risky code was written
* Claude self-assesses whether error handling is needed
* No blocking, no friction, just awareness

**Example output:**

    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    📋 ERROR HANDLING SELF-CHECK
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    
    ⚠️  Backend Changes Detected
       2 file(s) edited
    
       ❓ Did you add Sentry.captureException() in catch blocks?
       ❓ Are Prisma operations wrapped in error handling?
    
       💡 Backend Best Practice:
          - All errors should be captured to Sentry
          - Controllers should extend BaseController
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# The Complete Hook Pipeline

Here's what happens on every Claude response now:

    Claude finishes responding
      ↓
    Hook 1: Prettier formatter runs → All edited files auto-formatted
      ↓
    Hook 2: Build checker runs → TypeScript errors caught immediately
      ↓
    Hook 3: Error reminder runs → Gentle self-check for error handling
      ↓
    If errors found → Claude sees them and fixes
      ↓
    If too many errors → Auto-error-resolver agent recommended
      ↓
    Result: Clean, formatted, error-free code

And the UserPromptSubmit hook ensures Claude loads relevant skills BEFORE even starting work.

**No mess left behind.** It's beautiful.

# Scripts Attached to Skills

One really cool pattern I picked up from Anthropic's official skill examples on GitHub: **attach utility scripts to skills**.

For example, my `backend-dev-guidelines` skill has a section about testing authenticated routes. Instead of just explaining how authentication works, the skill references an actual script:

    ### Testing Authenticated Routes
    
    Use the provided test-auth-route.js script:
    
    
    `node scripts/test-auth-route.js http://localhost:3002/api/endpoint`

The script handles all the complex authentication steps for you:

1. Gets a refresh token from Keycloak
2. Signs the token with JWT secret
3. Creates cookie header
4. Makes authenticated request

When Claude needs to test a route, it knows exactly what script to use and how to use it. No more ""let me create a test script"" and reinventing the wheel every time.

I'm planning to expand this pattern - attach more utility scripts to relevant skills so Claude has ready-to-use tools instead of generating them from scratch.

# Tools and Other Things

# SuperWhisper on Mac

Voice-to-text for prompting when my hands are tired from typing. Works surprisingly well, and Claude understands my rambling voice-to-text surprisingly well.

# Memory MCP

I use this less over time now that skills handle most of the ""remembering patterns"" work. But it's still useful for tracking project-specific decisions and architectural choices that don't belong in skills.

# BetterTouchTool

* Relative URL copy from Cursor (for sharing code references)
   * I have VSCode open to more easily find the files I’m looking for and I can double tap CAPS-LOCK, then BTT inputs the shortcut to copy relative URL, transforms the clipboard contents by prepending an ‘@’ symbol, focuses the terminal, and then pastes the file path. All in one.
* Double-tap hotkeys to quickly focus apps (CMD+CMD = Claude Code, OPT+OPT = Browser)
* Custom gestures for common actions

Honestly, the time savings on just not fumbling between apps is worth the BTT purchase alone.

# Scripts for Everything

If there's any annoying tedious task, chances are there's a script for that:

* Command-line tool to generate mock test data. Before using Claude code, it was extremely annoying to generate mock data because I would have to make a submission to a form that had about a 120 questions Just to generate one single test submission.
* Authentication testing scripts (get tokens, test routes)
* Database resetting and seeding
* Schema diff checker before migrations
* Automated backup and restore for dev database

**Pro tip:** When Claude helps you write a useful script, immediately document it in CLAUDE.md or attach it to a relevant skill. Future you will thank past you.

# Documentation (Still Important, But Evolved)

I think next to planning, documentation is almost just as important. I document everything as I go in addition to the dev docs that are created for each task or feature. From system architecture to data flow diagrams to actual developer docs and APIs, just to name a few.

**But here's what changed:** Documentation now works WITH skills, not instead of them.

**Skills contain:** Reusable patterns, best practices, how-to guides **Documentation contains:** System architecture, data flows, API references, integration points

For example:

* ""How to create a controller"" → **backend-dev-guidelines skill**
* ""How our workflow engine works"" → **Architecture documentation**
* ""How to write React components"" → **frontend-dev-guidelines skill**
* ""How notifications flow through the system"" → **Data flow diagram + notification skill**

I still have a LOT of docs (850+ markdown files), but now they're laser-focused on project-specific architecture rather than repeating general best practices that are better served by skills.

You don't necessarily have to go that crazy, but I highly recommend setting up multiple levels of documentation. Ones for broad architectural overview of specific services, wherein you'll include paths to other documentation that goes into more specifics of different parts of the architecture. It will make a major difference on Claude's ability to easily navigate your codebase.

# Prompt Tips

When you're writing out your prompt, you should try to be as specific as possible about what you are wanting as a result. Once again, you wouldn't ask a builder to come out and build you a new bathroom without at least discussing plans, right?

""You're absolutely right! Shag carpet probably is not the best idea to have in a bathroom.""

Sometimes you might not know the specifics, and that's okay. If you don't ask questions, tell Claude to research and come back with several potential solutions. You could even use a specialized subagent or use any other AI chat interface to do your research. The world is your oyster. I promise you this will pay dividends because you will be able to look at the plan that Claude has produced and have a better idea if it's good, bad, or needs adjustments. Otherwise, you're just flying blind, pure vibe-coding. Then you're gonna end up in a situation where you don't even know what context to include because you don't know what files are related to the thing you're trying to fix.

**Try not to lead in your prompts** if you want honest, unbiased feedback. If you're unsure about something Claude did, ask about it in a neutral way instead of saying, ""Is this good or bad?"" Claude tends to tell you what it thinks you want to hear, so leading questions can skew the response. It's better to just describe the situation and ask for thoughts or alternatives. That way, you'll get a more balanced answer.

# Agents, Hooks, and Slash Commands (The Holy Trinity)

# Agents

I've built a small army of specialized agents:

**Quality Control:**

* `code-architecture-reviewer` \- Reviews code for best practices adherence
* `build-error-resolver` \- Systematically fixes TypeScript errors
* `refactor-planner` \- Creates comprehensive refactoring plans

**Testing & Debugging:**

* `auth-route-tester` \- Tests backend routes with authentication
* `auth-route-debugger` \- Debugs 401/403 errors and route issues
* `frontend-error-fixer` \- Diagnoses and fixes frontend errors

**Planning & Strategy:**

* `strategic-plan-architect` \- Creates detailed implementation plans
* `plan-reviewer` \- Reviews plans before implementation
* `documentation-architect` \- Creates/updates documentation

**Specialized:**

* `frontend-ux-designer` \- Fixes styling and UX issues
* `web-research-specialist` \- Researches issues along with many other things on the web
* `reactour-walkthrough-designer` \- Creates UI tours

The key with agents is to give them **very specific roles** and clear instructions on what to return. I learned this the hard way after creating agents that would go off and do who-knows-what and come back with ""I fixed it!"" without telling me what they fixed.

# Hooks (Covered Above)

The hook system is honestly what ties everything together. Without hooks:

* Skills sit unused
* Errors slip through
* Code is inconsistently formatted
* No automatic quality checks

With hooks:

* Skills auto-activate
* Zero errors left behind
* Automatic formatting
* Quality awareness built-in

# Slash Commands

I have quite a few custom slash commands, but these are the ones I use most:

**Planning & Docs:**

* `/dev-docs` \- Create comprehensive strategic plan
* `/dev-docs-update` \- Update dev docs before compaction
* `/create-dev-docs` \- Convert approved plan to dev doc files

**Quality & Review:**

* `/code-review` \- Architectural code review
* `/build-and-fix` \- Run builds and fix all errors

**Testing:**

* `/route-research-for-testing` \- Find affected routes and launch tests
* `/test-route` \- Test specific authenticated routes

The beauty of slash commands is they expand into full prompts, so you can pack a ton of context and instructions into a simple command. Way better than typing out the same instructions every time.

# Conclusion

After six months of hardcore use, here's what I've learned:

**The Essentials:**

1. **Plan everything** \- Use planning mode or strategic-plan-architect
2. **Skills + Hooks** \- Auto-activation is the only way skills actually work reliably
3. **Dev docs system** \- Prevents Claude from losing the plot
4. **Code reviews** \- Have Claude review its own work
5. **PM2 for backend** \- Makes debugging actually bearable

**The Nice-to-Haves:**

* Specialized agents for common tasks
* Slash commands for repeated workflows
* Comprehensive documentation
* Utility scripts attached to skills
* Memory MCP for decisions

And that's about all I can think of for now. Like I said, I'm just some guy, and I would love to hear tips and tricks from everybody else, as well as any criticisms. Because I'm always up for improving upon my workflow. I honestly just wanted to share what's working for me with other people since I don't really have anybody else to share this with IRL (my team is very small, and they are all very slow getting on the AI train).

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read. If you have questions about any of this stuff or want more details on implementation, happy to share. The hooks and skills system especially took some trial and error to get right, but now that it's working, I can't imagine going back.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

# Disclaimer

I made a post about six months ago sharing my experience after a week of hardcore use with Claude Code. It's now been about six months of hardcore use, and I would like to share some more tips, tricks, and word vomit with you all. I may have went a little overboard here so strap in, grab a coffee, sit on the toilet or whatever it is you do when doom-scrolling reddit.

I want to start the post off with a disclaimer: all the content within this post is merely me sharing what setup is working best for me currently and should not be taken as gospel or the only correct way to do things. It's meant to hopefully inspire you to improve your setup and workflows with AI agentic coding. I'm just a guy, and this is just like, my opinion, man.

Also, I'm on the 20x Max plan, so your mileage may vary. And if you're looking for vibe-coding tips, you should look elsewhere. If you want the best out of CC, then you should be working together with it: planning, reviewing, iterating, exploring different approaches, etc.

# Quick Overview

After 6 months of pushing Claude Code to its limits (solo rewriting 300k LOC), here's the system I built:

* Skills that actually auto-activate when needed
* Dev docs workflow that prevents Claude from losing the plot
* PM2 + hooks for zero-errors-left-behind
* Army of specialized agents for reviews, testing, and planning

Let's get into it.

# Background

I'm a software engineer who has been working on production web apps for the last seven years or so. And I have fully embraced the wave of AI with open arms. I'm not too worried about AI taking my job anytime soon, as it is a tool that I use to leverage my capabilities. In doing so, I have been building MANY new features and coming up with all sorts of new proposal presentations put together with Claude and GPT-5 Thinking to integrate new AI systems into our production apps. Projects I would have never dreamt of having the time to even consider before integrating AI into my workflow. And with all that, I'm giving myself a good deal of job security and have become the AI guru at my job since everyone else is about a year or so behind on how they're integrating AI into their day-to-day.

With my newfound confidence, I proposed a pretty large redesign/refactor of one of our web apps used as an internal tool at work. This was a pretty rough college student-made project that was forked off another project developed by me as an intern (created about 7 years ago and forked 4 years ago). This may have been a bit overly ambitious of me since, to sell it to the stakeholders, I agreed to finish a top-down redesign of this fairly decent-sized project (\~100k LOC) in a matter of a few months...all by myself. I knew going in that I was going to have to put in extra hours to get this done, even with the help of CC. But deep down, I know it's going to be a hit, automating several manual processes and saving a lot of time for a lot of people at the company.

It's now six months later... yeah, I probably should not have agreed to this timeline. I have tested the limits of both Claude as well as my own sanity trying to get this thing done. I completely scrapped the old frontend, as everything was seriously outdated and I wanted to play with the latest and greatest. I'm talkin' React 16 JS → React 19 TypeScript, React Query v2 → TanStack Query v5, React Router v4 w/ hashrouter → TanStack Router w/ file-based routing, Material UI v4 → MUI v7, all with strict adherence to best practices. The project is now at \~300-400k LOC and my life expectancy \~5 years shorter. It's finally ready to put up for testing, and I am incredibly happy with how things have turned out.

This used to be a project with insurmountable tech debt, ZERO test coverage, HORRIBLE developer experience (testing things was an absolute nightmare), and all sorts of jank going on. I addressed all of those issues with decent test coverage, manageable tech debt, and implemented a command-line tool for generating test data as well as a dev mode to test different features on the frontend. During this time, I have gotten to know CC's abilities and what to expect out of it.

# A Note on Quality and Consistency

I've noticed a recurring theme in forums and discussions - people experiencing frustration with usage limits and concerns about output quality declining over time. I want to be clear up front: I'm not here to dismiss those experiences or claim it's simply a matter of ""doing it wrong."" Everyone's use cases and contexts are different, and valid concerns deserve to be heard.

That said, I want to share what's been working for me. In my experience, CC's output has actually improved significantly over the last couple of months, and I believe that's largely due to the workflow I've been constantly refining. My hope is that if you take even a small bit of inspiration from my system and integrate it into your CC workflow, you'll give it a better chance at producing quality output that you're happy with.

Now, let's be real - there are absolutely times when Claude completely misses the mark and produces suboptimal code. This can happen for various reasons. First, AI models are stochastic, meaning you can get widely varying outputs from the same input. Sometimes the randomness just doesn't go your way, and you get an output that's legitimately poor quality through no fault of your own. Other times, it's about how the prompt is structured. There can be significant differences in outputs given slightly different wording because the model takes things quite literally. If you misword or phrase something ambiguously, it can lead to vastly inferior results.

# Sometimes You Just Need to Step In

Look, AI is incredible, but it's not magic. There are certain problems where pattern recognition and human intuition just win. If you've spent 30 minutes watching Claude struggle with something that you could fix in 2 minutes, just fix it yourself. No shame in that. Think of it like teaching someone to ride a bike, sometimes you just need to steady the handlebars for a second before letting go again.

I've seen this especially with logic puzzles or problems that require real-world common sense. AI can brute-force a lot of things, but sometimes a human just ""gets it"" faster. Don't let stubbornness or some misguided sense of ""but the AI should do everything"" waste your time. Step in, fix the issue, and keep moving.

I've had my fair share of terrible prompting, which usually happens towards the end of the day where I'm getting lazy and I'm not putting that much effort into my prompts. And the results really show. So next time you are having these kinds of issues where you think the output is way worse these days because you think Anthropic shadow-nerfed Claude, I encourage you to take a step back and reflect on how you are prompting.

**Re-prompt often.** You can hit double-esc to bring up your previous prompts and select one to branch from. You'd be amazed how often you can get way better results armed with the knowledge of what you don't want when giving the same prompt. All that to say, there can be many reasons why the output quality seems to be worse, and it's good to self-reflect and consider what you can do to give it the best possible chance to get the output you want.

As some wise dude somewhere probably said, ""Ask not what Claude can do for you, ask what context you can give to Claude"" \~ Wise Dude

Alright, I'm going to step down from my soapbox now and get on to the good stuff.

# My System

I've implemented a lot changes to my workflow as it relates to CC over the last 6 months, and the results have been pretty great, IMO.

# Skills Auto-Activation System (Game Changer!)

This one deserves its own section because it completely transformed how I work with Claude Code.

# The Problem

So Anthropic releases this Skills feature, and I'm thinking ""this looks awesome!"" The idea of having these portable, reusable guidelines that Claude can reference sounded perfect for maintaining consistency across my massive codebase. I spent a good chunk of time with Claude writing up comprehensive skills for frontend development, backend development, database operations, workflow management, etc. We're talking thousands of lines of best practices, patterns, and examples.

And then... nothing. Claude just wouldn't use them. I'd literally use the exact keywords from the skill descriptions. Nothing. I'd work on files that should trigger the skills. Nothing. It was incredibly frustrating because I could see the potential, but the skills just sat there like expensive decorations.

# The ""Aha!"" Moment

That's when I had the idea of using **hooks**. If Claude won't automatically use skills, what if I built a system that MAKES it check for relevant skills before doing anything?

So I dove into Claude Code's hook system and built a multi-layered auto-activation architecture with TypeScript hooks. And it actually works!

# How It Works

I created two main hooks:

**1. UserPromptSubmit Hook** (runs BEFORE Claude sees your message):

* Analyzes your prompt for keywords and intent patterns
* Checks which skills might be relevant
* Injects a formatted reminder into Claude's context
* Now when I ask ""how does the layout system work?"" Claude sees a big ""🎯 SKILL ACTIVATION CHECK - Use project-catalog-developer skill"" (project catalog is a large complex data grid based feature on my front end) before even reading my question

**2. Stop Event Hook** (runs AFTER Claude finishes responding):

* Analyzes which files were edited
* Checks for risky patterns (try-catch blocks, database operations, async functions)
* Displays a gentle self-check reminder
* ""Did you add error handling? Are Prisma operations using the repository pattern?""
* Non-blocking, just keeps Claude aware without being annoying

# skill-rules.json Configuration

I created a central configuration file that defines every skill with:

* **Keywords**: Explicit topic matches (""layout"", ""workflow"", ""database"")
* **Intent patterns**: Regex to catch actions (""(create|add).\*?(feature|route)"")
* **File path triggers**: Activates based on what file you're editing
* **Content triggers**: Activates if file contains specific patterns (Prisma imports, controllers, etc.)

Example snippet:

    {
      ""backend-dev-guidelines"": {
        ""type"": ""domain"",
        ""enforcement"": ""suggest"",
        ""priority"": ""high"",
        ""promptTriggers"": {
          ""keywords"": [""backend"", ""controller"", ""service"", ""API"", ""endpoint""],
          ""intentPatterns"": [
            ""(create|add).*?(route|endpoint|controller)"",
            ""(how to|best practice).*?(backend|API)""
          ]
        },
        ""fileTriggers"": {
          ""pathPatterns"": [""backend/src/**/*.ts""],
          ""contentPatterns"": [""router\\."", ""export.*Controller""]
        }
      }
    }

# The Results

Now when I work on backend code, Claude automatically:

1. Sees the skill suggestion before reading my prompt
2. Loads the relevant guidelines
3. Actually follows the patterns consistently
4. Self-checks at the end via gentle reminders

**The difference is night and day.** No more inconsistent code. No more ""wait, Claude used the old pattern again."" No more manually telling it to check the guidelines every single time.

# Following Anthropic's Best Practices (The Hard Way)

After getting the auto-activation working, I dove deeper and found Anthropic's official best practices docs. Turns out I was doing it wrong because they recommend keeping the main SKILL.md file **under 500 lines** and using progressive disclosure with resource files.

Whoops. My frontend-dev-guidelines skill was 1,500+ lines. And I had a couple other skills over 1,000 lines. These monolithic files were defeating the whole purpose of skills (loading only what you need).

So I restructured everything:

* **frontend-dev-guidelines**: 398-line main file + 10 resource files
* **backend-dev-guidelines**: 304-line main file + 11 resource files

Now Claude loads the lightweight main file initially, and only pulls in detailed resource files when actually needed. Token efficiency improved 40-60% for most queries.

# Skills I've Created

Here's my current skill lineup:

**Guidelines & Best Practices:**

* `backend-dev-guidelines` \- Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories
* `frontend-dev-guidelines` \- React 19, MUI v7, TanStack Query/Router patterns
* `skill-developer` \- Meta-skill for creating more skills

**Domain-Specific:**

* `workflow-developer` \- Complex workflow engine patterns
* `notification-developer` \- Email/notification system
* `database-verification` \- Prevent column name errors (this one is a guardrail that actually blocks edits!)
* `project-catalog-developer` \- DataGrid layout system

All of these automatically activate based on what I'm working on. It's like having a senior dev who actually remembers all the patterns looking over Claude's shoulder.

# Why This Matters

Before skills + hooks:

* Claude would use old patterns even though I documented new ones
* Had to manually tell Claude to check BEST\_PRACTICES.md every time
* Inconsistent code across the 300k+ LOC codebase
* Spent too much time fixing Claude's ""creative interpretations""

After skills + hooks:

* Consistent patterns automatically enforced
* Claude self-corrects before I even see the code
* Can trust that guidelines are being followed
* Way less time spent on reviews and fixes

If you're working on a large codebase with established patterns, I cannot recommend this system enough. The initial setup took a couple of days to get right, but it's paid for itself ten times over.

# CLAUDE.md and Documentation Evolution

In a post I wrote 6 months ago, I had a section about rules being your best friend, which I still stand by. But my CLAUDE.md file was quickly getting out of hand and was trying to do too much. I also had this massive BEST\_PRACTICES.md file (1,400+ lines) that Claude would sometimes read and sometimes completely ignore.

So I took an afternoon with Claude to consolidate and reorganize everything into a new system. Here's what changed:

# What Moved to Skills

Previously, BEST\_PRACTICES.md contained:

* TypeScript standards
* React patterns (hooks, components, suspense)
* Backend API patterns (routes, controllers, services)
* Error handling (Sentry integration)
* Database patterns (Prisma usage)
* Testing guidelines
* Performance optimization

**All of that is now in skills** with the auto-activation hook ensuring Claude actually uses them. No more hoping Claude remembers to check BEST\_PRACTICES.md.

# What Stayed in CLAUDE.md

Now CLAUDE.md is laser-focused on **project-specific info** (only \~200 lines):

* Quick commands (`pnpm pm2:start`, `pnpm build`, etc.)
* Service-specific configuration
* Task management workflow (dev docs system)
* Testing authenticated routes
* Workflow dry-run mode
* Browser tools configuration

# The New Structure

    Root CLAUDE.md (100 lines)
    ├── Critical universal rules
    ├── Points to repo-specific claude.md files
    └── References skills for detailed guidelines
    
    Each Repo's claude.md (50-100 lines)
    ├── Quick Start section pointing to:
    │   ├── PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md - Architecture & integration
    │   ├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Common issues
    │   └── Auto-generated API docs
    └── Repo-specific quirks and commands

**The magic:** Skills handle all the ""how to write code"" guidelines, and CLAUDE.md handles ""how this specific project works."" Separation of concerns for the win.

# Dev Docs System

This system, out of everything (besides skills), I think has made the most impact on the results I'm getting out of CC. Claude is like an extremely confident junior dev with extreme amnesia, losing track of what they're doing easily. This system is aimed at solving those shortcomings.

The dev docs section from my CLAUDE.md:

    ### Starting Large Tasks
    
    When exiting plan mode with an accepted plan: 1.**Create Task Directory**:
    mkdir -p ~/git/project/dev/active/[task-name]/
    
    2.**Create Documents**:
    
    - `[task-name]-plan.md` - The accepted plan
    - `[task-name]-context.md` - Key files, decisions
    - `[task-name]-tasks.md` - Checklist of work
    
    3.**Update Regularly**: Mark tasks complete immediately
    
    ### Continuing Tasks
    
    - Check `/dev/active/` for existing tasks
    - Read all three files before proceeding
    - Update ""Last Updated"" timestamps

These are documents that always get created for every feature or large task. Before using this system, I had many times when I all of a sudden realized that Claude had lost the plot and we were no longer implementing what we had planned out 30 minutes earlier because we went off on some tangent for whatever reason.

# My Planning Process

My process starts with planning. **Planning is king**. If you aren't at a minimum using planning mode before asking Claude to implement something, you're gonna have a bad time, mmm'kay. You wouldn't have a builder come to your house and start slapping on an addition without having him draw things up first.

When I start planning a feature, I put it into planning mode, even though I will eventually have Claude write the plan down in a markdown file. I'm not sure putting it into planning mode necessary, but to me, it feels like planning mode gets better results doing the research on your codebase and getting all the correct context to be able to put together a plan.

I created a `strategic-plan-architect` subagent that's basically a planning beast. It:

* Gathers context efficiently
* Analyzes project structure
* Creates comprehensive structured plans with executive summary, phases, tasks, risks, success metrics, timelines
* Generates three files automatically: plan, context, and tasks checklist

But I find it really annoying that you can't see the agent's output, and even more annoying is if you say no to the plan, it just kills the agent instead of continuing to plan. So I also created a custom slash command (`/dev-docs`) with the same prompt to use on the main CC instance.

Once Claude spits out that beautiful plan, I take time to review it thoroughly. **This step is really important.** Take time to understand it, and you'd be surprised at how often you catch silly mistakes or Claude misunderstanding a very vital part of the request or task.

More often than not, I'll be at 15% context left or less after exiting plan mode. But that's okay because we're going to put everything we need to start fresh into our dev docs. Claude usually likes to just jump in guns blazing, so I immediately slap the ESC key to interrupt and run my `/create-dev-docs` slash command. The command takes the approved plan and creates all three files, sometimes doing a bit more research to fill in gaps if there's enough context left.

And once I'm done with that, I'm pretty much set to have Claude fully implement the feature without getting lost or losing track of what it was doing, even through an auto-compaction. I just make sure to remind Claude every once in a while to update the tasks as well as the context file with any relevant context. And once I'm running low on context in the current session, I just run my slash command `/update-dev-docs`. Claude will note any relevant context (with next steps) as well as mark any completed tasks or add new tasks before I compact the conversation. And all I need to say is ""continue"" in the new session.

During implementation, depending on the size of the feature or task, I will specifically tell Claude to only implement one or two sections at a time. That way, I'm getting the chance to go in and review the code in between each set of tasks. And periodically, I have a subagent also reviewing the changes so I can catch big mistakes early on. If you aren't having Claude review its own code, then I highly recommend it because it saved me a lot of headaches catching critical errors, missing implementations, inconsistent code, and security flaws.

# PM2 Process Management (Backend Debugging Game Changer)

This one's a relatively recent addition, but it's made debugging backend issues so much easier.

# The Problem

My project has seven backend microservices running simultaneously. The issue was that Claude didn't have access to view the logs while services were running. I couldn't just ask ""what's going wrong with the email service?"" - Claude couldn't see the logs without me manually copying and pasting them into chat.

# The Intermediate Solution

For a while, I had each service write its output to a timestamped log file using a `devLog` script. This worked... okay. Claude could read the log files, but it was clunky. Logs weren't real-time, services wouldn't auto-restart on crashes, and managing everything was a pain.

# The Real Solution: PM2

Then I discovered PM2, and it was a game changer. I configured all my backend services to run via PM2 with a single command: `pnpm pm2:start`

**What this gives me:**

* Each service runs as a managed process with its own log file
* **Claude can easily read individual service logs in real-time**
* Automatic restarts on crashes
* Real-time monitoring with `pm2 logs`
* Memory/CPU monitoring with `pm2 monit`
* Easy service management (`pm2 restart email`, `pm2 stop all`, etc.)

**PM2 Configuration:**

    // ecosystem.config.jsmodule.exports = {
      apps: [
        {
          name: 'form-service',
          script: 'npm',
          args: 'start',
          cwd: './form',
          error_file: './form/logs/error.log',
          out_file: './form/logs/out.log',
        },
    // ... 6 more services
      ]
    };

**Before PM2:**

    Me: ""The email service is throwing errors""
    Me: [Manually finds and copies logs]
    Me: [Pastes into chat]
    Claude: ""Let me analyze this...""

**The debugging workflow now:**

    Me: ""The email service is throwing errors""
    Claude: [Runs] pm2 logs email --lines 200
    Claude: [Reads the logs] ""I see the issue - database connection timeout...""
    Claude: [Runs] pm2 restart email
    Claude: ""Restarted the service, monitoring for errors...""

Night and day difference. Claude can autonomously debug issues now without me being a human log-fetching service.

**One caveat:** Hot reload doesn't work with PM2, so I still run the frontend separately with `pnpm dev`. But for backend services that don't need hot reload as often, PM2 is incredible.

# Hooks System (#NoMessLeftBehind)

The project I'm working on is multi-root and has about eight different repos in the root project directory. One for the frontend and seven microservices and utilities for the backend. I'm constantly bouncing around making changes in a couple of repos at a time depending on the feature.

And one thing that would annoy me to no end is when Claude forgets to run the build command in whatever repo it's editing to catch errors. And it will just leave a dozen or so TypeScript errors without me catching it. Then a couple of hours later I see Claude running a build script like a good boy and I see the output: ""There are several TypeScript errors, but they are unrelated, so we're all good here!""

No, we are not good, Claude.

# Hook #1: File Edit Tracker

First, I created a **post-tool-use hook** that runs after every Edit/Write/MultiEdit operation. It logs:

* Which files were edited
* What repo they belong to
* Timestamps

Initially, I made it run builds immediately after each edit, but that was stupidly inefficient. Claude makes edits that break things all the time before quickly fixing them.

# Hook #2: Build Checker

Then I added a **Stop hook** that runs when Claude finishes responding. It:

1. Reads the edit logs to find which repos were modified
2. Runs build scripts on each affected repo
3. Checks for TypeScript errors
4. If < 5 errors: Shows them to Claude
5. If ≥ 5 errors: Recommends launching auto-error-resolver agent
6. Logs everything for debugging

Since implementing this system, I've not had a single instance where Claude has left errors in the code for me to find later. The hook catches them immediately, and Claude fixes them before moving on.

# Hook #3: Prettier Formatter

This one's simple but effective. After Claude finishes responding, automatically format all edited files with Prettier using the appropriate `.prettierrc` config for that repo.

No more going into to manually edit a file just to have prettier run and produce 20 changes because Claude decided to leave off trailing commas last week when we created that file.

# Hook #4: Error Handling Reminder

This is the gentle philosophy hook I mentioned earlier:

* Analyzes edited files after Claude finishes
* Detects risky patterns (try-catch, async operations, database calls, controllers)
* Shows a gentle reminder if risky code was written
* Claude self-assesses whether error handling is needed
* No blocking, no friction, just awareness

**Example output:**

    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    📋 ERROR HANDLING SELF-CHECK
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    
    ⚠️  Backend Changes Detected
       2 file(s) edited
    
       ❓ Did you add Sentry.captureException() in catch blocks?
       ❓ Are Prisma operations wrapped in error handling?
    
       💡 Backend Best Practice:
          - All errors should be captured to Sentry
          - Controllers should extend BaseController
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# The Complete Hook Pipeline

Here's what happens on every Claude response now:

    Claude finishes responding
      ↓
    Hook 1: Prettier formatter runs → All edited files auto-formatted
      ↓
    Hook 2: Build checker runs → TypeScript errors caught immediately
      ↓
    Hook 3: Error reminder runs → Gentle self-check for error handling
      ↓
    If errors found → Claude sees them and fixes
      ↓
    If too many errors → Auto-error-resolver agent recommended
      ↓
    Result: Clean, formatted, error-free code

And the UserPromptSubmit hook ensures Claude loads relevant skills BEFORE even starting work.

**No mess left behind.** It's beautiful.

# Scripts Attached to Skills

One really cool pattern I picked up from Anthropic's official skill examples on GitHub: **attach utility scripts to skills**.

For example, my `backend-dev-guidelines` skill has a section about testing authenticated routes. Instead of just explaining how authentication works, the skill references an actual script:

    ### Testing Authenticated Routes
    
    Use the provided test-auth-route.js script:
    
    
    node scripts/test-auth-route.js http://localhost:3002/api/endpoint

The script handles all the complex authentication steps for you:

1. Gets a refresh token from Keycloak
2. Signs the token with JWT secret
3. Creates cookie header
4. Makes authenticated request

When Claude needs to test a route, it knows exactly what script to use and how to use it. No more ""let me create a test script"" and reinventing the wheel every time.

I'm planning to expand this pattern - attach more utility scripts to relevant skills so Claude has ready-to-use tools instead of generating them from scratch.

# Tools and Other Things

# SuperWhisper on Mac

Voice-to-text for prompting when my hands are tired from typing. Works surprisingly well, and Claude understands my rambling voice-to-text surprisingly well.

# Memory MCP

I use this less over time now that skills handle most of the ""remembering patterns"" work. But it's still useful for tracking project-specific decisions and architectural choices that don't belong in skills.

# BetterTouchTool

* Relative URL copy from Cursor (for sharing code references)
   * I have VSCode open to more easily find the files I’m looking for and I can double tap CAPS-LOCK, then BTT inputs the shortcut to copy relative URL, transforms the clipboard contents by prepending an ‘@’ symbol, focuses the terminal, and then pastes the file path. All in one.
* Double-tap hotkeys to quickly focus apps (CMD+CMD = Claude Code, OPT+OPT = Browser)
* Custom gestures for common actions

Honestly, the time savings on just not fumbling between apps is worth the BTT purchase alone.

# Scripts for Everything

If there's any annoying tedious task, chances are there's a script for that:

* Command-line tool to generate mock test data. Before using Claude code, it was extremely annoying to generate mock data because I would have to make a submission to a form that had about a 120 questions Just to generate one single test submission.
* Authentication testing scripts (get tokens, test routes)
* Database resetting and seeding
* Schema diff checker before migrations
* Automated backup and restore for dev database

**Pro tip:** When Claude helps you write a useful script, immediately document it in CLAUDE.md or attach it to a relevant skill. Future you will thank past you.

# Documentation (Still Important, But Evolved)

I think next to planning, documentation is almost just as important. I document everything as I go in addition to the dev docs that are created for each task or feature. From system architecture to data flow diagrams to actual developer docs and APIs, just to name a few.

**But here's what changed:** Documentation now works WITH skills, not instead of them.

**Skills contain:** Reusable patterns, best practices, how-to guides **Documentation contains:** System architecture, data flows, API references, integration points

For example:

* ""How to create a controller"" → **backend-dev-guidelines skill**
* ""How our workflow engine works"" → **Architecture documentation**
* ""How to write React components"" → **frontend-dev-guidelines skill**
* ""How notifications flow through the system"" → **Data flow diagram + notification skill**

I still have a LOT of docs (850+ markdown files), but now they're laser-focused on project-specific architecture rather than repeating general best practices that are better served by skills.

You don't necessarily have to go that crazy, but I highly recommend setting up multiple levels of documentation. Ones for broad architectural overview of specific services, wherein you'll include paths to other documentation that goes into more specifics of different parts of the architecture. It will make a major difference on Claude's ability to easily navigate your codebase.

# Prompt Tips

When you're writing out your prompt, you should try to be as specific as possible about what you are wanting as a result. Once again, you wouldn't ask a builder to come out and build you a new bathroom without at least discussing plans, right?

""You're absolutely right! Shag carpet probably is not the best idea to have in a bathroom.""

Sometimes you might not know the specifics, and that's okay. If you don't ask questions, tell Claude to research and come back with several potential solutions. You could even use a specialized subagent or use any other AI chat interface to do your research. The world is your oyster. I promise you this will pay dividends because you will be able to look at the plan that Claude has produced and have a better idea if it's good, bad, or needs adjustments. Otherwise, you're just flying blind, pure vibe-coding. Then you're gonna end up in a situation where you don't even know what context to include because you don't know what files are related to the thing you're trying to fix.

**Try not to lead in your prompts** if you want honest, unbiased feedback. If you're unsure about something Claude did, ask about it in a neutral way instead of saying, ""Is this good or bad?"" Claude tends to tell you what it thinks you want to hear, so leading questions can skew the response. It's better to just describe the situation and ask for thoughts or alternatives. That way, you'll get a more balanced answer.

# Agents, Hooks, and Slash Commands (The Holy Trinity)

# Agents

I've built a small army of specialized agents:

**Quality Control:**

* `code-architecture-reviewer` \- Reviews code for best practices adherence
* `build-error-resolver` \- Systematically fixes TypeScript errors
* `refactor-planner` \- Creates comprehensive refactoring plans

**Testing & Debugging:**

* `auth-route-tester` \- Tests backend routes with authentication
* `auth-route-debugger` \- Debugs 401/403 errors and route issues
* `frontend-error-fixer` \- Diagnoses and fixes frontend errors

**Planning & Strategy:**

* `strategic-plan-architect` \- Creates detailed implementation plans
* `plan-reviewer` \- Reviews plans before implementation
* `documentation-architect` \- Creates/updates documentation

**Specialized:**

* `frontend-ux-designer` \- Fixes styling and UX issues
* `web-research-specialist` \- Researches issues along with many other things on the web
* `reactour-walkthrough-designer` \- Creates UI tours

The key with agents is to give them **very specific roles** and clear instructions on what to return. I learned this the hard way after creating agents that would go off and do who-knows-what and come back with ""I fixed it!"" without telling me what they fixed.

# Hooks (Covered Above)

The hook system is honestly what ties everything together. Without hooks:

* Skills sit unused
* Errors slip through
* Code is inconsistently formatted
* No automatic quality checks

With hooks:

* Skills auto-activate
* Zero errors left behind
* Automatic formatting
* Quality awareness built-in

# Slash Commands

I have quite a few custom slash commands, but these are the ones I use most:

**Planning & Docs:**

* `/dev-docs` \- Create comprehensive strategic plan
* `/dev-docs-update` \- Update dev docs before compaction
* `/create-dev-docs` \- Convert approved plan to dev doc files

**Quality & Review:**

* `/code-review` \- Architectural code review
* `/build-and-fix` \- Run builds and fix all errors

**Testing:**

* `/route-research-for-testing` \- Find affected routes and launch tests
* `/test-route` \- Test specific authenticated routes

The beauty of slash commands is they expand into full prompts, so you can pack a ton of context and instructions into a simple command. Way better than typing out the same instructions every time.

# Conclusion

After six months of hardcore use, here's what I've learned:

**The Essentials:**

1. **Plan everything** \- Use planning mode or strategic-plan-architect
2. **Skills + Hooks** \- Auto-activation is the only way skills actually work reliably
3. **Dev docs system** \- Prevents Claude from losing the plot
4. **Code reviews** \- Have Claude review its own work
5. **PM2 for backend** \- Makes debugging actually bearable

**The Nice-to-Haves:**

* Specialized agents for common tasks
* Slash commands for repeated workflows
* Comprehensive documentation
* Utility scripts attached to skills
* Memory MCP for decisions

And that's about all I can think of for now. Like I said, I'm just some guy, and I would love to hear tips and tricks from everybody else, as well as any criticisms. Because I'm always up for improving upon my workflow. I honestly just wanted to share what's working for me with other people since I don't really have anybody else to share this with IRL (my team is very small, and they are all very slow getting on the AI train).

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read. If you have questions about any of this stuff or want more details on implementation, happy to share. The hooks and skills system especially took some trial and error to get right, but now that it's working, I can't imagine going back.

TL;DR: Built an auto-activation system for Claude Code skills using TypeScript hooks, created a dev docs workflow to prevent context loss, and implemented PM2 + automated error checking. Result: Solo rewrote 300k LOC in 6 months with consistent quality.",75,1761712956.0,ClaudeAI,15,0.89,False

1oivget,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1oivget/coffee_vs_your_health_myths_facts_you_need_to_know/,Coffee vs. Your Health: Myths & Facts You Need to Know!,"# The Story Behind Our Love for Coffee

Let me tell you a small story.

When I was a teenager, my father used to drink coffee every morning before work. He said it helped him think clearly. But my mother believed coffee was bad for health. She always warned, “Too much coffee will hurt your heart.”

For years, I was confused. Was coffee a friend or an enemy to our health?

If you’ve ever wondered the same, you’re not alone. Millions of people across the world drink coffee daily — but many are unsure whether it’s helping or harming them.

Coffee is more than just a drink. It’s part of our culture, our work mornings, and even our memories. But when it comes to **health**, myths and facts often get mixed.

So, in this article, I’ll break it all down in **simple words**. We’ll look at **the truth behind coffee myths**, **the science-backed health facts**, and **expert opinions** that can help you enjoy your coffee — with confidence and care.

# Common Coffee Myths — What People Believe vs. What’s Real

Many people think coffee is bad for them. But science shows a different story. Let’s look at some common myths and uncover the truth.

# Myth #1: Coffee Causes Heart Disease

This is one of the most common beliefs. People think coffee increases blood pressure and harms the heart.

**Fact:** Studies from Harvard University show that **moderate coffee drinking (2–4 cups a day)** does **not** increase the risk of heart disease. In fact, some research suggests it may lower the risk of stroke in some adults.

**Why?** Coffee contains antioxidants — compounds that protect your blood vessels and improve circulation.

|**Myth**|**Reality**|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee damages the heart|Moderate coffee helps protect heart health|
|Coffee raises blood pressure permanently|It raises it slightly for a short time only|

**Expert Opinion:**  
Dr. Walter Willett, a nutrition expert at Harvard, said, *“For most people, coffee is not a risk factor for heart disease. In fact, it can be part of a healthy lifestyle.”*

# Myth #2: Coffee Dehydrates the Body

Some people think coffee removes water from the body and causes dehydration.

**Fact:** While coffee is a mild diuretic (it makes you urinate more), it **does not cause dehydration** if you drink it in normal amounts.

If you drink **3–4 cups a day**, it still contributes to your daily water intake.

|**Myth**|**Truth**|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee dries out your body|Coffee hydrates like other drinks|

**Tip:** Drink one extra glass of water if you’re having more than 4 cups a day.

# Myth #3: Coffee Causes Insomnia

People often blame coffee for sleepless nights.

**Fact:** Coffee can disturb sleep **only if you drink it too late in the day.** Caffeine stays in your system for **about 5–6 hours.**

If you stop drinking coffee after 2 PM, it’s unlikely to affect your sleep.

|**Coffee Time**|**Effect on Sleep**|
|:-|:-|
|Morning|No effect|
|Afternoon|Mild effect|
|Evening/Night|Can cause trouble sleeping|

**Pro Tip:** If you are sensitive to caffeine, try **decaf coffee** after lunch.

# Myth #4: Coffee Causes Addiction

Many people say, “I can’t live without coffee — I must be addicted!”

**Fact:** Coffee may create **mild dependence**, but not addiction. Caffeine affects your brain’s alertness, but quitting doesn’t cause serious withdrawal problems.

You may feel tired or get a small headache for a day or two — that’s it.

|**Addiction Type**|**Level**|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee dependence|Mild and temporary|
|Drug addiction|Severe and dangerous|

# Myth #5: Coffee Stunts Growth

Parents often warn kids that coffee will stop them from growing tall.

**Fact:** There’s **no scientific proof** that coffee affects growth. This myth started many decades ago without evidence. Growth depends on **nutrition, sleep, and genetics**, not coffee.

# Proven Coffee Facts Backed by Science

Now that we’ve busted the myths, let’s explore the **real health benefits of coffee**, supported by science.

# 1. Coffee Boosts Brain Power

Caffeine in coffee blocks adenosine — a chemical that makes you feel sleepy.  
This keeps your mind active and focused.

According to research, people who drink coffee regularly show **better memory and attention**.

**Expert View:**  
Dr. Astrid Nehlig from the French National Institute of Health said,  
*“Caffeine improves alertness, reaction time, and mental performance in moderate amounts.”*

|**Benefit**|**Effect**|
|:-|:-|
|Better focus|Helps with work and study|
|Sharp memory|Reduces forgetfulness|
|Faster reaction|Improves daily performance|

# 2. Coffee May Lower Risk of Diabetes

According to a study from the **American Diabetes Association**, people who drink 3–4 cups of coffee daily have a **25% lower risk** of type 2 diabetes.

Coffee improves how the body uses insulin, which helps control blood sugar levels.

|**Cups per Day**|**Risk Reduction**|
|:-|:-|
|1–2 cups|10% lower|
|3–4 cups|25% lower|
|5+ cups|No extra benefit|

# 3. Coffee Protects the Liver

Your liver works hard to process toxins and fats. Coffee helps it stay healthy.

A **2016 study** found that people who drink coffee have **up to 40% lower risk** of liver diseases such as cirrhosis and fatty liver.

**Why it helps:**

* Coffee lowers liver enzymes
* Reduces inflammation
* Supports liver cell repair

# 4. Coffee Reduces Risk of Depression

Coffee contains natural mood-boosting compounds. It stimulates dopamine and serotonin — the “happy” chemicals in your brain.

People who drink **2–3 cups daily** have a **20% lower risk** of depression, according to Harvard research.

**Real-Life Story:**  
I once met a nurse who said, “When I drink coffee before my shift, I feel happier and more social.” That’s the emotional boost caffeine provides.

# 5. Coffee Can Help You Burn Fat

Caffeine boosts your metabolism — it helps your body burn calories faster.  
That’s why many **weight-loss supplements** include caffeine as an ingredient.

**Stat:**  
Caffeine can increase fat burning by **10–15%** in lean people and **3–5%** in obese people.

# 6. Coffee Is Rich in Antioxidants

Coffee is one of the biggest sources of antioxidants in the modern diet — even more than fruits or vegetables in some cases.

These antioxidants protect cells from damage and slow aging.

|**Antioxidant Compound**|**Health Benefit**|
|:-|:-|
|Chlorogenic acid|Fights inflammation|
|Cafestol|Supports liver function|
|Melanoidins|Improves gut health|

# Expert Insights, Statistics, and Real Experiences

To better understand coffee’s health impact, let’s look at expert insights and real-world data.

# What Experts Say

|**Expert Name**|**Field**|**Quote**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dr. Rob van Dam|Nutrition Scientist|“Coffee, in moderation, can be part of a healthy lifestyle.”|
|Dr. Walter Willett|Harvard T.H. Chan School|“Evidence shows that coffee consumption is linked with lower risk of several chronic diseases.”|
|Dr. Astrid Nehlig|Brain Researcher|“Caffeine improves cognitive function and mood when used responsibly.”|

# Global Coffee Consumption Stats

|**Country**|**Average Cups per Day**|**Health Findings**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Finland|4–5 cups|Low heart disease rate|
|USA|2–3 cups|Improved alertness & focus|
|Japan|2 cups|Lower risk of liver disease|

**Fact:** Over **2 billion cups of coffee** are consumed daily around the world!

# Customer Experience: Real People, Real Benefits

**Story 1 – The Busy Student:**  
Sarah, a college student, said, “I used to feel sleepy during study sessions. Now, one cup of coffee helps me stay awake without energy drinks.”

**Story 2 – The Office Worker:**  
David, 45, shared, “I replaced sugary sodas with black coffee. I lost 5 pounds in 2 months and feel more active.”

**Story 3 – The Senior Coffee Lover:**  
Mary, 68, said, “I’ve been drinking coffee for 40 years. My doctor says my blood sugar and liver are healthy. I think coffee helps me.”

# Coffee Intake Recommendations

|**Category**|**Safe Daily Amount**|**Note**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Adults|3–4 cups|About 400 mg caffeine|
|Pregnant women|1–2 cups|Consult doctor first|
|Teens|1 small cup|Avoid late-night use|

**Tip:** The key is **moderation** — enjoy coffee, but don’t overdo it.

# The Final Truth — Coffee and Your Health

After learning all these facts, it’s clear that coffee is **not your enemy**.  
It’s a **powerful, natural drink** with real health benefits — when enjoyed responsibly.

# What We’ve Learned:

* Coffee doesn’t harm the heart when used moderately.
* It helps protect the brain, liver, and even mood.
* It can lower the risk of diseases like diabetes and depression.
* Too much coffee can cause restlessness, anxiety, or sleep problems.
* The secret is **balance**, not avoidance.

# When to Be Careful

Even though coffee has many benefits, you should be cautious if you:

* Have high blood pressure (limit to 1–2 cups).
* Are pregnant or nursing.
* Feel anxious or have sleep troubles.

**Pro Advice:** Always listen to your body. If coffee makes you jittery, try switching to half-caffeine or decaf.

# A Quick Summary Table

|**Health Area**|**Effect of Coffee**|**Evidence Strength**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Brain Function|Improves focus & memory|Strong|
|Heart Health|Safe in moderation|Strong|
|Liver Health|Reduces disease risk|Strong|
|Diabetes|Lowers type 2 risk|Strong|
|Sleep|Affected if taken late|Moderate|
|Hydration|Neutral effect|Moderate|

# Final Words

I’ve learned through years of reading, talking to experts, and observing people that **coffee is a complex but amazing beverage**. It’s not about whether coffee is “good” or “bad.” It’s about **how we drink it**.

If you enjoy coffee the right way — not too much, not too late — it can make you healthier, happier, and sharper every day.

So next time someone says, “Coffee is bad for you,” you can smile and share the truth. Because now, you know the real story.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I have put well over 700+ hours into this game and have an idea for a hyperspecific playthrough. IDK what to name it but think of it like a ""coping-mechanisms"" playthrough where our survivor in essence, would be trying to get a semblance of their old life back and would want to start their day off with coffee (or tea) plus breakfast foods (Oats, pancakes, maybe Bannock? one could stretch that baked potato could be a substitute for home fries or hashbrowns, And maybe dried fish could be justified for breakfast like for a lox bagel eaten with bannock.), lunch and dinner foods can otherwise be just about anything but the big thing im trying to get at here is that every day ideally if a person is used to having a cup of hot coffee in the morning that this simple act could really hamper their ability to survive longer and would definately negatively affect travel whilst simultaniously requiring alot more travel, especially late game for the trader. You would pretty much have to travel to one of the places with a radio for coffee from the trader at like bleak inlet or one of the places that gets frequent auroras just to be able to set up the trades to get more coffee when acorns run out or if you have to eat them for acorn bannock. What do you all think about this self imposed challenge? It can be done on most every difficutlty but i tend to stay on the lower difficulties in general. Let me know what you think?

I used sora 2 for the main animation because it’s surprisingly good at physical comedy. I typed something like “office worker slowly losing sanity while holding a coffee cup that keeps refilling on its own.” sora 2 actually animated the cup overfilling perfectly, even adding that little jitter before the spill.

then I took the scene into domoai to exaggerate the facial reaction. domoai’s expression mapping gave it that overly dramatic anime look  perfect for memes.

to finish, I used nano banana to add a quick body-motion layer. I waved my arms in front of my webcam, recorded the motion, and it instantly synced with the sora 2 animation. it made the movement look human enough to be funny but still ai-weird.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Detroit Pistons vs. Orlando Magic: A Tale of Two Turnovers and a Hip Check**

The Detroit Pistons, fresh off a 21-point drubbing at the hands of the Cleveland Cavaliers, are hosting the Orlando Magic in what promises to be a game as chaotic as a toddler in a buffet line. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The betting lines tell a tale of two teams too close to call. The Pistons are listed at **decimal odds of \~1.91** (implied probability: \~52.3%), while the Magic hover around **1.87** (\~53.5%). The spread? A razor-thin **Magic -1.0**, suggesting bookmakers see Orlando as a slight favorite despite their three-game skid. The total is set at **225.5 points**, which feels about right—these teams combined for 211 points in their last meeting, and neither exactly plays like the 1990s Bulls.

But here’s the kicker: Detroit’s recent performance is as shaky as a Jell-O shot. Their 26 turnovers against Cleveland? That’s enough to make a NBA coach weep. Meanwhile, Orlando’s defense is a sieve that could strain pasta. Last game, they let the 76ers’ guards rack up 69 points while committing only seven turnovers. It’s like watching a leaky faucet host a pool party.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Hip Checks, and a Losing Streak

**Detroit’s Woes:**

* **Cade Cunningham**, their star guard, is listed as “probable” with a **left hip contusion**. Let’s just say his hip isn’t feeling the love right now. Against Cleveland, he shot 3-of-14 and turned the ball over five times—proof that even superheroes need a hip check now and then.
* **Injuries to Caris LeVert, Marcus Sasser, and Jaden Ivey** mean Detroit’s bench, which averaged 40.2 points last season, will be more like a bench warmer. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff’s “We’ll be better” speech is inspiring, but can it fix a team that looks like it forgot how to pass?

**Orlando’s Struggles:**

* The Magic have lost three straight,

- waterproof/resistant picnic blanket to keep him dry if he wants to lay down outside
- poop bags & doggie wipes

Human gear:

- additional small battery pack
- mini cooler for snacks/drinks

I’m moving to Seattle soon, and the whole apartment search has been a little overwhelming, so I’d love some local advice.

A few quick fun facts about me:

1. I’m in my early 20s.
2. I don’t have a car, so I’m relying on public transport and walkability.
3. My budget is around <= $1300/month (ideally for a studio.)
4. Safety is a big priority.
5. I’d love to be in a young, lively area: somewhere with coffee shops, restaurants, and a bit of a social scene nearby.
6. I’d also love to be closer to the tech scene 

If anyone has recommendations for good neighborhoods, specific apartment complexes, or even property management companies to check out (or avoid 😅), I’d really appreciate it.

Also open to any general moving tips for someone new to Seattle, things like hidden gem neighborhoods, public transit passes, or what to expect weather-wise.
