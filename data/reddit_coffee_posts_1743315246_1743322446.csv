1jn7poi,https://i.redd.it/2bw8epgmasre1.jpeg,Night shifts tips for recovery.,"Hi,

First time posting on here but been following this sub for a while now.

I wonder if some people got tips on how they get trough there night shifts and especially how to get recovery back up in the days after.

This week ive worked only 2 night shifts, wednesday the 26st i started and i ended friday morning the 28th.
Ive been really trying and improving on sleep since Whoop and always hit the 75%-85% range recovery, but after night shifts my body keeps being in the medium to high stress zone when i sleep. 

During night shifts i already am doing the following:
- don‚Äôt eat big meals.
- drink lots of water.
- use Magnesium biglycinate 30min before bed.
- darken my room.
- last night shift only sleep 4 hours so i am tired at night to hopefully get back in to normal rythm.
- no coffee / sugar during the shifts.
- When i wake up directly go in to sunlight and gym.

If you‚Äôve got any tips or tricks that you use and would like to share, i would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks in advance.

Modern furniture is all about clean lines, thoughtful materials, and blending form with function. Whether you're furnishing a minimalist living room or a cozy nook, two standout pieces can instantly elevate your interiors the metal table and the rattan coffee table.

**Why Modern Furniture Is More Than Just a Trend**

[Modern furniture](https://homeandsouldubai.com/collections/furniture) has become the go-to choice for homeowners who want to balance simplicity with sophistication. Think neutral tones, sustainable materials, and versatile designs that can adapt to any room or layout. It‚Äôs not just about aesthetics‚Äîit‚Äôs about living well with pieces that bring comfort, clarity, and timeless charm to your home.

**The Metal Table: Sleek, Strong, and Sophisticated**

When it comes to modern furniture, the [metal table](https://homeandsouldubai.com/products/louis-metal-coffee-table-black) stands out for its durability and edgy appeal. Whether it's a side table, console, or dining table, metal offers a refined, industrial look that fits effortlessly into contemporary homes.

Pair a matte black metal coffee table with a soft linen sofa for contrast, or go bold with a brushed brass side table to add a touch of glam.

**The Rattan Coffee Table: Natural Texture Meets Modern Style**

On the other side of the spectrum, the [rattan coffee table](https://homeandsouldubai.com/collections/coffee-tables) offers warmth, texture, and a hint of boho charm‚Äîall while fitting beautifully into a modern setting. This handcrafted material adds an organic touch to sleek interiors, creating a cozy, layered look.

Use a round rattan coffee table to soften a space filled with clean angles, or pair it with a plush rug and neutral-toned sofa for a warm, inviting living room setup.

**How to Mix and Match**

The best modern spaces aren't defined by just one material or look‚Äîthey're curated collections of complementary elements. Try styling a metal table beside a rattan coffee table to create contrast and visual interest. Add some textured cushions, layered rugs, and sleek lighting to tie the look together.

**Final Thoughts**

Modern furniture is all about blending materials and tones to create a space that feels personal and polished. Whether you're drawn to the bold lines of a metal table or the earthy elegance of a rattan coffee table, these pieces bring character, function, and lasting style to your home.",1,1743321679.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. I won‚Äôt bring any drama into your life. 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s tgats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

\------------------------------------------------------

The pale morning light crept through the half-drawn curtains as David hunched over his textbooks at the kitchen table. His eyes burned from lack of sleep, fingers cramping around his pen. The apartment was quiet‚Äîfor now.

Across the room, the bedroom door creaked open. Emma shuffled into the living room, her hair tangled from sleep, yawning loudly as she stretched. She barely glanced at David before flopping onto the couch and grabbing the remote.

Click.

The TV blared to life, some reality show erupting with shrill laughter and dramatic music. David flinched but didn‚Äôt look up. His jaw tightened as Emma cranked the volume higher, humming along to the jingle of a commercial.

Emma¬†(muttering around a mouthful of cereal): ""Ugh, why is¬†everything¬†so loud this early?""

She kicked her feet onto the coffee table, knocking over an empty yogurt cup from last night. It rolled toward David‚Äôs notes, leaving a sticky trail. He caught it just before it smudged his paper.

David¬†(softly): ""Sorry, I‚Äôll‚Äî""

Emma¬†(waving him off, eyes glued to the screen): ""Whatever. Pass me that blanket?""

He reached for the throw draped over the chair beside him, handing it to her. She snatched it without thanks, tucking it around herself as she crunched her cereal louder than necessary.

A few minutes later, Emma set her empty bowl on the table with a¬†clank, spoon still inside. She sighed dramatically, eyeing the crumbs and spilled milk on the couch beside her.

""Ew. David, can you clean this up? You know I¬†hate¬†messes just sitting there.""

He didn‚Äôt argue. He never did.

As he wiped the table, Emma stretched lazily, scrolling through her phone.

""Thanks,""¬†she said, flashing him a fleeting smile before turning back to the screen. 

""Ugh, I¬†should¬†study too, but I just can‚Äôt focus. It‚Äôs so boring.""

She grabbed her laptop, flopping back onto the couch. David glanced up from his notes‚Äîfinally, maybe she‚Äôd turn the TV off‚Äîbut she just balanced the screen on her knees, typing one-handed while the other scrolled through her phone.

Emma¬†(muttering to herself): ""How to make studying less painful‚Ä¶""

Her nails tapped loudly as she skimmed articles.

Emma¬†(reading aloud, sarcastic): ""‚ÄòStudy with friends!‚Äô Yeah,¬†no‚ÄîCharlotte just talks about her nails. ‚ÄòChew gum!‚Äô Like¬†that‚Äôll¬†help.""

David ducked his head back over his textbook, but she suddenly gasped.

Emma¬†(grinning): ""This¬†one‚Äôs perfect! Listen: ‚ÄòRelax your body from head to toe to stimulate focus.‚Äô"" She wiggled her toes against the coffee table. ""What do you think, David?""

He hesitated.¬†Emma‚Äôs grin always meant trouble.

David¬†(cautious):""I guess‚Ä¶ stretching helps?""

David barely looked up before she was peeling off her socks, dropping her feet onto the coffee table.

""""Close! It¬†*actually*¬†says I need a foot massage. Something about ‚Äòpressure points‚Äô and ‚Äòmental clarity.‚Äô"" She yanked off her socks before he could react. ""See? Scientific.""

He hesitated. His exam notes were still half-finished, and the clock was ticking.

""Emma, I really don‚Äôt have time‚Äî"" Her smile vanished.¬†""You‚Äôve been studying all morning. It‚Äôs my turn now."" She didn‚Äôt ask. She never asked. ""Quick, before I lose motivation! And don‚Äôt skip the arches‚Äîthat‚Äôs where the ‚Äòstress points‚Äô are.""

David slid out of his chair and knelt beside the couch, pressing his thumbs into the arch of her foot. Emma sighed dramatically, tilting her head back as if he were some personal masseuse rather than someone who actually had his own work to do.

""Ah,¬†yes‚Äîthe dedicated student, sacrificing for the greater good.""""Mmm, that‚Äôs the spot,""¬†she murmured, scrolling through her phone.

He kept his eyes on the clock. He still had hours of studying left, and soon, he‚Äôd have to leave for his shift at the coffee bar. John expected him early‚Äî""We‚Äôre swamped on Sundays, kid.""

Emma‚Äôs phone buzzed. She smirked.

""John just texted. He says don‚Äôt be late.""

David‚Äôs hands stilled for just a second before he forced himself to keep going.

She hadn‚Äôt even thanked him.

Emma let out a long, exaggerated sigh as David‚Äôs fingers worked over the arch of her foot. She wiggled her toes, pressing them deliberately into his palm.

""Mmm, don‚Äôt stop,""¬†she murmured, scrolling lazily through her phone.¬†""It‚Äôs finally starting to feel good.""

David kept his eyes down, his thumbs moving in slow circles. The clock on the wall ticked louder with every passing minute.

""You know,""¬†Emma mused, tilting her head,¬†""I‚Äôm in a bit of a dilemma. I¬†really¬†want you to keep going, but I also don‚Äôt want you to be late for John.""¬†She tapped her foot against his knee.¬†""So, how are you going to solve this? Hmm?""

David stayed silent.

Emma‚Äôs foot lifted, the tip of her big toe nudging his chin upward until he met her gaze.¬†""Well?""¬†she said, pressing her toe lightly against the bridge of his nose.¬†""How do we make sure¬†everyone¬†is happy?""

David swallowed.¬†""I‚Ä¶ I can massage your feet another time.""

Emma pouted, letting out a theatrical sigh.¬†""What a shame. They feel¬†so¬†good right now.""¬†She flexed her toes, stretching them out in front of her.¬†""But fine. Just know I‚Äôm holding you to it. And you‚Äôd better make sure you have¬†plenty¬†of free time next time. No excuses.""

When David hesitated, thinking she was done, Emma‚Äôs foot pressed firmly against his chest, shoving him back into place.¬†""Oh no, you‚Äôre not finished yet,""¬†she said, her voice light but firm.¬†""You still have a few minutes before you¬†absolutely¬†have to leave.""

She leaned back, stretching her arms behind her head.¬†""You know, I‚Äôm really glad you‚Äôre working for John now. It‚Äôs good for you. But let‚Äôs be clear‚Äîyou¬†have¬†to give it your absolute best. I don‚Äôt want to hear from him that you slacked off for even a¬†second.""

David‚Äôs hands kept moving, though his fingers had started to ache.

""And don‚Äôt just stand around waiting for orders,""¬†Emma continued, tapping her foot impatiently against his wrist.¬†""You should¬†always¬†be asking what else you can do. Always working. No sitting, no leaning‚Äînothing lazy.""¬†A slow grin spread across her face.¬†""Actually, I think I‚Äôll tell John that sitting is¬†completely¬†off-limits for you. Wouldn‚Äôt that be funny?""

David blinked.¬†""So‚Ä¶ I have to stand the whole time?""

Emma gave him a look‚Äîhalf amused, half exasperated.¬†""Uh‚Ä¶¬†yes? That‚Äôs literally what we just talked about.""

Another ten minutes passed before she finally waved him off, checking the time on her phone.¬†""Alright, you‚Äôd better go,""¬†she said, stretching her legs out with a satisfied sigh.¬†""Wouldn‚Äôt want you to be late. John¬†hates¬†that.""

David stood, his knees stiff from kneeling. Emma watched him gather his things, her smile lingering as he headed for the door.

""And David?""¬†she called after him.¬†""Don‚Äôt forget‚Äînext time, my feet get¬†all¬†your attention.""

The door clicked shut behind him. The apartment was quiet again.

Emma turned the TV volume back up and settled deeper into the couch, perfectly at ease.

¬†

¬†

The bell above the door jingled as David stepped inside, the scent of roasted coffee beans and steamed milk thick in the air. Behind the counter, John looked up from polishing an espresso machine, his grin widening when he spotted him.

""Hey, kid. Right on time.""

Before David could respond, John strode over and clapped a heavy hand on his shoulder, the impact just shy of painful.¬†""Good to see you. We‚Äôre slammed today‚Äîtwo call-outs. Lucky for me, I‚Äôve got¬†you.""¬†He squeezed David‚Äôs shoulder, his grip too tight to be friendly.¬†""Minimum wage, maximum effort. That‚Äôs the deal, right?""

David opened his mouth, but John barreled on, steering him toward the kitchen with a nudge.

""See, normally I‚Äôd have to pay¬†real¬†employees double for this kinda rush. But you?""¬†John chuckled, shaking his head like it was the easiest math in the world.¬†""You‚Äôre gonna work twice as hard, twice as fast, and cover¬†twice¬†the workload. And all for peanuts.""¬†He spread his hands, grinning.¬†""Win-win.""

David‚Äôs stomach knotted, but Emma‚Äôs voice echoed in his head‚ÄîGive it your absolute best.

John snapped his fingers toward the industrial sink piled high with dishes.¬†""Clock‚Äôs ticking, kid.""

Steam rose in thick waves as David plunged his hands into the scalding water, scrubbing at crusted milk frothers and syrup-stained pitchers. His sleeves were soaked within minutes, the detergent stinging the raw spots on his knuckles from yesterday‚Äôs cleaning marathon.

Every so often, John‚Äôs shadow loomed in the doorway.

""Faster,""¬†he‚Äôd say, or¬†""That one‚Äôs still got coffee grounds on it,""¬†tossing a ""clean"" plate back into the suds with a splash. Once, he grabbed a half-dried mug from David‚Äôs hands, inspecting it under the harsh kitchen lights.

""You call this done?""¬†John scraped a thumb along the rim, revealing a faint smudge.¬†""Emma said you were thorough.¬†This¬†ain‚Äôt thorough.""

David‚Äôs jaw tightened, but he took the mug back without a word, scrubbing until his fingertips burned.

By the third hour, the dish rack overflowed, and David‚Äôs lower back screamed from hunching over the sink. A server‚Äîsome college kid‚Äîdumped another tub of dirty cups onto the counter, barely glancing at him.

""John says stack these first,""¬†she muttered, already walking away.

David blinked at the tower of plates. His first shift was supposed to end in twenty minutes.

From the front, laughter burst out‚ÄîJohn‚Äôs loud and booming, mingling with a familiar bright cadence. David peered through the service window.

Emma perched on a barstool, sipping a caramel-drizzled drink while John leaned across the counter, smirking as she twirled her hair around a finger.

""So?""¬†she asked, voice carrying.¬†""Is he keeping up?""

John snorted.¬†""Kid‚Äôs a machine. Barely looks up from that sink.""¬†He wiped a glass lazily, nodding toward the kitchen.¬†""You weren‚Äôt kidding‚Äîhe¬†does¬†give it his absolute best.""

Emma beamed, kicking her feet lightly.¬†""Told you.""

David turned back to the sink, plunging his hands into the water again. The soap stung deeper this time.

The kitchen door swung open, and Emma strolled in, her heels clicking against the tile floor. David‚Äôs hands stilled in the soapy water, but she didn‚Äôt look at him‚Äînot at first. Instead, she surveyed the gleaming stacks of dishes, the spotless countertops, her lips curving in approval.

""Good,""¬†she said, finally turning to him.¬†""Keep going. John deserves nothing less than your absolute best.""¬†She patted his shoulder, her fingers lingering just a second too long before she turned away, leaving behind a trace of her perfum.

Through the service window, he watched her approach John at the bar. The way she leaned in, the way John‚Äôs smirk widened as she whispered something in his ear. Then‚Äîslow, deliberate‚Äîshe kissed him. Not a peck, not something casual. Deep, possessive, her fingers tangling in John‚Äôs hair as she pulled him closer.

David‚Äôs grip tightened around the plate in his hands.

Emma‚Äôs eyes fluttered open‚Äîand locked onto his.

She didn‚Äôt stop.

She¬†watched¬†him as she kissed John, her gaze steady, unblinking, as if savoring the way David‚Äôs throat worked, the way his knuckles turned white around the dishrag. A silent reminder:¬†This could never be you.

When she finally pulled away, she gave John one last smile, tossed her hair over her shoulder, and left without a backward glance.

""Kid. Break time. Sit.""

John slid into the corner booth, a heaping plate of food in front of him‚Äîthick-cut fries, a burger oozing cheese, none of which David had been offered.

David hesitated.¬†""I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt. Emma said‚Äî""

""Right, right, no sitting.""¬†John waved a dismissive hand.¬†""Stand there, then.""¬†He gestured to the edge of the table, where David could hover like a waiter.

John took a huge bite of his burger, chewing loudly before washing it down with a swig of beer.¬†""Alright kid, let's hear it,""¬†John said, gesturing with the bottle.¬†""You clearly know Emma better than anyone. So tell me - what's she really like when no one's watching?""

David shifted his weight, the damp soles of his shoes sticking slightly to the tile floor. He could still feel the heat from the dishwater radiating off his chapped hands.

""She...she sleeps with the window open, even in winter,""¬†he began quietly.¬†""Says she likes hearing the city sounds. But then she complains about being cold and steals all the blankets.""

John barked out a laugh.¬†""That tracks. What else?""

""She hums when she's concentrating,""¬†David continued, his voice gaining a hesitant warmth.¬†""Just little nonsense tunes. Mostly when she's doing her makeup or scrolling through her phone. She doesn't even realize she's doing it.""

He absentmindedly traced a water ring on the table with his fingertip.¬†""In the mornings, she needs exactly two cups of coffee before she can form complete sentences. The first one has to be...""

""Let me guess - some fancy vanilla caramel bullshit?""¬†John interrupted with a smirk.

""No,""¬†David said, a defensive edge creeping into his tone.¬†""Just black, with one sugar. But it has to be in her yellow mug. The one with the chip on the handle. She won't drink it from anything else.""

John's eyebrows rose.¬†""Damn. You pay attention, don't you?""

David's ears burned, but he continued, the words tumbling out now like he'd been holding them back for years.

""She bites her lip when she's trying not to laugh at something inappropriate. And she always loses hair ties - you'll find them everywhere, on doorknobs, in the silverware drawer. She claims they just disappear.""

He hesitated before adding,¬†""When she's really tired, she rubs her right earlobe between her fingers. It's this little...thing she's done since we were kids.""

John whistled low.¬†""Jesus. You've got it bad.""¬†He took another swig of beer, studying David with new interest.¬†""So tell me this - what's her perfect night look like?""

David didn't even need to think.

""She'd want it to feel special but not stuffy. Candles, but not too many - just enough to make the light warm. That ros√© she likes, the one from the little vineyard near her aunt's house. Music playing quietly in the background - nothing with lyrics, it distracts her when she's talking.""

His hands gestured slightly as he spoke, coming alive in a way they never did when washing dishes.¬†""For food, start with those baked brie bites she loves, then the carbonara - but the noodles have to be al dente or she won't eat it. And for dessert...""

""Let me guess,""¬†John interrupted, grinning.¬†""Something chocolate.""

""No,""¬†David said softly.¬†""Lemon tart. With the crust just thick enough to hold together but not so much that it overpowers the filling. And it has to have fresh raspberries on the side, not mixed in.""

John stared at him for a long moment before bursting into laughter.¬†""Holy shit, kid. You're like her personal Wikipedia page.""¬†He shook his head, still chuckling.¬†""Well, looks like you just planned my perfect date night. Hope you don't mind cooking all that.""

David stared at him.¬†""You want me to‚Äî""

""Cook? Yeah.""¬†John shrugged.¬†""And set the table, pick the wine‚Äîhell, pick the music, if you want. Just make sure it‚Äôs perfect.""¬†He took another swig of beer.¬†""Oh, and obviously, she can‚Äôt know you were involved. This is¬†my¬†romantic gesture.""

John pushed his empty plate away and stood, clapping David on the shoulder with a grip that was just a little too tight.¬†""Don't look so glum. At least you'll know she's happy, right?""

David‚Äôs stomach growled:""John, can I‚Äî""

""If you‚Äôre about to ask if you can eat,""¬†John interrupted,¬†""the answer‚Äôs no. You eat before or after your shift. That‚Äôs how this works.""¬†He snapped a rubber band around a stack of bills.¬†""Besides, Emma told me you‚Äôre used to skipping meals.""

David‚Äôs hands stilled.¬†She‚Äôd told him that?

\------

Finally, the last dish was stacked. David peeled off his soaked apron, shoulders sagging with relief.¬†""I‚Äôm done, then? I can‚Äî""

""Whoa, hold up,""¬†John said, holding up a hand.¬†""Sunday nights, I do the books. You‚Äôll stay.""

David blinked.¬†""What do you need me to do?""

""Stand there,""¬†John said simply, settling into a booth with a ledger.¬†""In case I need something.""

Thirty minutes passed.

David shifted from foot to foot near the bar, watching John scribble numbers and sip a beer he hadn‚Äôt offered to share. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.

""Kid,""¬†John called suddenly.¬†""Get me another beer.""

David fetched it silently. John didn‚Äôt thank him.

Another twenty minutes ticked by before John finally snapped the ledger shut.¬†""Alright, that‚Äôs a wrap.""¬†He pulled an envelope from his back pocket and handed it to David.¬†""Your cut.""

David peeked inside. The amount was short‚Äîmissing a full hour‚Äôs pay.

""The last hour,""¬†he started,¬†""it‚Äôs not‚Äî""

""You just stood there,""¬†John said, shrugging.¬†""Consider it a favor. You‚Äôre helping me out, I‚Äôm helping you out.""¬†He licked his thumb and smoothed the envelope‚Äôs flap shut.¬†""Besides, this all goes to Emma anyway, right?""

David‚Äôs throat tightened, but he nodded.

John grinned and clapped him on the shoulder‚Äîhard.¬†""Good. Now listen: Thursday night‚Äôs the big surprise for Emma. You‚Äôll come to my place, cook everything, set it all up.""

""I can come after school‚Äî""

""No,""¬†John cut in.¬†""You‚Äôll skip school. Be there by noon. I want every detail perfect.""¬†His grip tightened, fingers digging into David‚Äôs collarbone.¬†""You¬†do¬†want her to be happy, don‚Äôt you?""

The words hung between them, heavy as a threat.

David stared at the envelope in his hands.¬†""Yeah,""¬†he muttered.¬†""I do.""

John released him with a final pat.¬†""Great. See you Thursday, kid.""

The door jingled as David stepped into the cold night. The envelope felt like lead in his pocket. Somewhere, Emma was probably texting John right now, her laughter bright and effortless, never guessing who‚Äôd really be cooking her perfect meal.

Up until 15th September 2024. I celebrated Eid day like this

All the kids got money, my mom got Eid money, she cooked A FEAST of lamb mandi and rice. All of us siblings gathered there. The evening would turn into her closest friends coming round, us putting some music on and my mom being the main one on the dance floor. It was never anything super extravagant or extreme. It was just a day of celebration with food and family. 

On Mother‚Äôs Day, without fail, my mom would wake up to a parcel of flowers. I would then have saved up the whole year to get the biggest thing she wanted (one year it was a specific Rado watch and last year it was the Samsung Fold). Most Mother‚Äôs Day would be me hanging with her, and most likely taking her for food or ordering in. Again, nothing huge but something meaningful for us. 

This year, my siblings have been flakey on getting together for Eid. No one wants to go to the grave, and I‚Äôve found it really hard. 

For context, 3 of my siblings have partners and children, I live alone and my youngest brothers live in the family home. 

I‚Äôm having my coffee before I head to the graveyard, I will take flowers and clean it up. I always have a chat with her about how heavy my heart is too. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll help. 

I just needed somewhere to get it off my chest before I do face my siblings at some point in the day. 

Eid Mubarak to those celebrating and happy Mother‚Äôs Day to all moms.

1jn7g0w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jn7g0w,[acne] need help with acne please!!,"i never had acne in my younger teen years besides the occasional breakout, so i never really needed to learn how to take care of it. about a year ago now, right before i turned 19, my skin started to break out more and more. now my face is riddled with acne scars and i don‚Äôt know what to do. ive always been bad with picking my skin, but it was fine with my breakouts were few and far apart. i‚Äôm still dealing with acne spots and it has completely diminished my confidence. i‚Äôve been trying different things but im in a budget so its been difficult to figure out what works best for me!

i would say that my skin type is relatively normal, it can be dry every once in a while but never oily. my skin will only flake on top of a healing pimple. 

most of my pimples are white heads or pustules (just learned what that is lmao) and i‚Äôll get a like two or three cysts (i think that‚Äôs what i should call them? they‚Äôre deep and never really form a head and are super painful) every month. but i‚Äôm really bad at compulsively picking them trying to get it out. these pop up usually on my the side of my chin, all over my forehead, and one of my cheeks. i also get small blackheads and closed comedomes on my forehead, but i don‚Äôt stress about those too much. 

i wash my face with cetaphil gentle skin cleanser twice a day (morning & night) and i will use it twice in one go. 

i used a whole bottle of the cerave acne foaming cream cleanser (has 4% benzoyl peroxide) hoping it would help and never noticed a difference, just made my skin feel dryer and bleached my towels haha

i started using the la roche posay double repair face moisturizer a couple of months ago and it feels great on my skin. before that i was using the cerave facial moisturizing lotion for a long time, but i never really liked it. 

i always leave the house with sunscreen. i‚Äôve been using the supergoop one lately

i use the hero rescue balm post blemish recovery cream on my spots, and when i first started i loved it so much and noticed a difference, but after using it for awhile ive been noticing it less. just helps keep them moisturized but doesn‚Äôt help too much with scarring or white heads reappearing. 

i like to use pimple patches to help cover the redness of a current pimple and to help it disappear quicker or right after i try to pop one. i really love the hero mighty patch original one 

when my acne first started appearing i had never worn face makeup before. i started wearing concealer about 3 months ago because i couldn‚Äôt stand looking at it anymore. i haven‚Äôt noticed it making it worse at all but i thought that might be important to note. 

my diet hasn‚Äôt really changed from when i never had acne to when it started to develop. a few theories i had were that i was on birth control from when i was 16-18. i was off it for about four months when my acne started. it also sort of lined up from when i started working as a barista, and had never been a coffee drinker before that. i wasn‚Äôt drinking dairy (i used oat milk) in the beginning. i took a month long break from coffee like three months ago and didn‚Äôt notice it getting better.

i‚Äôm really just at a lost. my self confidence has been deeply affected by this and i hate leaving the house or seeing friends because of it. it looks horrible and im scarred up everywhere. if anyone has any suggestions i‚Äôd love to hear them please. thank you so much for reading <3",3,1743320529.0,SkincareAddiction,4,1.0,False

The thing now is, i stopped pantoprazol 2/3 days ago and even start to eat normal again (including coffee, chocolate, orangea, fires, processed meats, cheese, lemonade, icecreams) i dont have experience that sensation of the stomach ""beeing Open"" and the most ive been feeling is hearthburn and still didnt have a normal episode of gerd. I havent been doing so much effords this week but i will ride my bike or make some workout to see if i have an episode of gerd.

Although i have this feeling of squeezing inside of the sternum area / upper stomach.

Maybe its to early to come out of ppis and feel reflux again , but im worried that i will do the Phmetry at a wrong time and catches nothing.

If you haven't read about my thing, here it is: I write down all the band shirts I see at concerts. With the idea being if you are a show I'm at, I should give the band you like enough to wear a shirt for a chance. (that sounds better vocally than in print)

It occurred to me I could use a numbered list in markdown to keep a running tally. (Markdown is just lightweight formatting). I'm not sure it made for a lower stress day.

Here's the list of all the shirts I saw today (or at least all I wrote down before they flitted out of my head):

I am someone who thrives in routine so this is the first time in a very long time that I've allowed myself to live from moment to moment with no agenda or plan and I've actually enjoyed it. I am, however, starting to crave some structure and consistency. I'd like to get back to waking up at the same time everyday, reading and working out daily as a start. The challenge I'm having is that my daughter's sleep schedule is still quite erratic, especially during the day. I know that this is normal for her age.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

She previously lived with her best friend and seemed to assume I'd just take that role. They used to eat meals and smoke weed together in the living room every night. I also smoke, but not as a recreational hobby, so I'd told her she wouldn't to hide it in her room.

My first week there I was covering a full week of overnight shifts. I'd wake up at 5/6pm and step out of my room to immediately be greeted with ""Hey buddy!"" and an invite to smoke or a request to look at something. Eventually I did join her, and she commented on the way I hold my hits. I started smoking as a replacement for self-harm when I was a teen. My father provided the weed and demanded we hold our hits in order to not waste it. I did not feel like explaining that & simply decided I did not enjoy her company. 

Months went by where I stayed at my boyfriend's 90% of the time because I got so much anxiety simply leaving my room because she'd always be right there, directly facing my room and the kitchen and the path to the bathroom. I asked multiple times that she stop ""camping out"" & she'd scurry to her room but be right there again the next day. There's a dining room between the living room and her bedroom that she was essentially using as a closet. She said she couldn't eat in there because her cat's litter boxes were there.

One day I finally had enough and I moved the coffee table with her excessive weed paraphernalia and open mail/trash into ""the cat room"" along with her TV and a chair. I couldn't get the couch through the doorway. I moved the litter boxes to the space in the living room right outside my bedroom and angled the couch so it was facing ""her"" side of the house. She bought a table for the kitchen and started camping out there instead. This actually had her sitting even closer to my bedroom door. 

Shortly after the rearrangement, the roof leaked in my room and I was expected to sleep on the couch for a month while repairs were done. Again, I spent most nights at my boyfriend's. The one night I tried to sleep at my apartment, I was scheduled to have an emergency tooth extraction in the morning & my roommate insisted on driving home two hours in a blizzard rather than staying at her parents. Maybe a week later she texted a ""heads up"" that she was having a date over to cook for her... While I still had no bedroom and would have been trying to sleep on the couch for my overnight shift. I'd anticipated her disrespect (even without a guest) and already gotten a hotel room for that weekend. She was confused as to why I was upset over ""something that didn't even happen"" & I eventually ended up screaming at her that she ""would have brought a stranger around me while I'm unconscious"" and shared some information about my trauma that I would have liked to keep private.

My room was fixed. My boyfriend has a history of violence and I decided I no longer want to tolerate it now that I have a room again. I shared this information with my roommate, again not actually wanting to reveal it. I felt I owed her an explanation as to why I was SO upset.

My roommate got a boyfriend just as my room was fixed. He's been over practically every night since, about a month now. They hang out in her clutter room (the dining room/cat room) and act like they're in time out and need to sneak around. I told her it was getting excessive a few days ago and asked if they can't stay at his place sometimes. 

Her response... Acknowledged that she knew she was triggering my trauma. She knows I cannot feel comfortable using the kitchen when there's people in the common area. Even though the clutter room is around a corner and out of sight, I'm still constantly waiting for ""my turn"" to use the house. She hangs out in there like it's her room, even without him, cackling, cooing and having conversations on the phone while I'm trying to sleep/get ready for work. She's started going to her room in the middle of conversations when it's clear she's started to talk about me. 

I know this is long and I'll probably be told to get over it. She appears to be trying to be considerate. But to me she's just being maliciously compliant. She told me she'd ask if I'm comfortable with him coming over from now on & then immediately asked if he could come over after one night off because he had to work late.

My real problem is that she was basically sneaking him in while I was in the shower... before I even said anything, she just never asked or informed me. I'd be changing in my room with the door still slightly ajar when I'd hear a man cough and know there was a stranger in the house. Honestly, I don't have a problem with him at all, HE seems quiet and respectful. I have a problem with her monopolizing the common area, not being able to control her own volume, not picking up after herself & hoarding the dining room. 

Oh, also, she never shuts the door when she uses the bathroom and always leaves her bedroom door open. I've started to feel like I can't leave the house when she's in the bathroom because I'd have to walk by the open door. 

I'm just triggered. She lacks boundaries and so doesn't seem able to understand or respect mine. I do NOT want to be the roommate that says ""you have to stay in your room""... But she's just so obliviously disrespectful of shared space and privacy. I think the big thing is that ""no means no"" & for months she just kept waiting outside my room for me, triggering that ""lack of consent"" trauma. Now she's having her bf over while I'm on my overnight shifts, not telling me or asking, right after she said she'd ask. Again, I don't have a problem with him personally... I have a problem with a man being brought in the house without my knowledge while I'm bathing/sleeping/vulnerable.",2,1743319108.0,CPTSD,4,1.0,False

I was in the military for our entire relationship and only recently retired from the service. We have 2 children together who are still preteen/teen.

There is so much context lost for the sake of brevity but here it goes.

We naturally have been separated a lot due to military lifestyle, and because of that our relationship has had several rocky moments, there are naturally past hurts that are relevant but this would turn into a novel if I tried to lay everything out. Most recently I was literally only home 2 days a week for my last 5 years, but we held on. I've only been retired for 3 months, and I knew there would be transition woes, but I wasn't prepared for this.

My biggest complaint over the last few years was a lack of intimacy both physical and emotional, to which she justified that it was easier to manage with me gone so much to maintain a certain level of distance and refrain from becoming too dependent.

Her biggest complaint as I understand from recent talks is that she felt I wasn't helping her around the house enough, and that when she asked me for help, she perceived my lack of support as a big F/U, several times over for the last few years. FYSA, she also works full-time, and she was essentially a single mom while I was away.

I explained to her that I knew I wasn't going nuts with cleaning and such, but I was helping appropriately in my head and that I wanted to spend more time taking her out to dinner or the kids to the movies, etc. She felt otherwise, and explained that she is very VERY resentful toward me because of my perceived lack of effort, and she has been contemplating divorce.

I thanked her for being honest, and I explained to her that I never knew the level of damage I was doing because she never explicitly communicated with me, to which she insisted that I should have known based on the things that she did say. Not playing the mind reader game here, and she may be right, I probably should have but I didn't.

This all started about three weeks ago, and I've been in my own head trying to analyze every possible way I can avert this crisis. We're going to marital therapy soon thank heavens. I am trying to go in with a plan because I want to make a productive and real effort to resolve these past hurts.

Since finding out, I've gone straight ""field day"" cleaning in the house and it is borderline white glove inspection ready. Doing all the laundry, basically all of the house chores across the board. I've been waking up with her to help her get ready for work in the morning i.e., coffee prep, starting the shower (simple things). None of this is too much for me because I am now home retired (at least temporarily).

The wits end part is that, aside from what I've written here, I have little to no idea where her heart is and it's killing me. She doesn't want to talk about it with me, and basically told me to wait until therapy. I'm trying and failing to not think or talk about it because I feel so in the dark, and when I have tried to talk to her, she just shuts me down and says we can't talk about this constantly and asked me to just act normal for now. Recently when I was feeling overwhelmed, I was going to leave the house for a bit and she asked where I was going. I replied ""I don't know, but I can't just sit here like everything is okay."" She didn't like that and asked me to stay and didn't want me to leave, so I stayed and we talked, but it was more or less a rehash of the previous conversation and nothing productive happened. This has happened twice now with the same results.

This was supposed to be a happy time, I'm finally home and we can be a family only for the family unit to just collapse. I'm heartbroken and trying very hard to stay focused on the chores and the kids, but it feels like a losing battle. My daughter keeps asking me why I'm so quiet lately, and I said mom and dad are having a rough time and trying to work on things. I know there isn't much more I can do without being overzealous, so here I am. Looking for what...I don't know, maybe moral support, other perspectives, anything to help for the next week waiting for therapy.

1jn73p8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jn73p8,Why is there a huge difference between the sachet and the box itself like it's so huge ( idk what sub to post this ) go through the body btw,"So when I was looking up to get some coffee restocked I thought let's buy a bottle which ""looks better"" and has better ""aesthetics"" and sells more for their brand value and less of the product for the bottle of Nescafe instant 180g the price is 783 which is around 4.35 per Gram and here comes the catch, the sachet costs 2rs per packet and it has 0.9g of coffee which is 2.22rs per Gram 

So, i was wondering why there is this huge gap between these , till now what I've read on reddit and quora that this is mainly a discrimination against the poor that they would not buy this bottle as this is expensive and buy the sachet instead and these usually sell in the malls where they consider poor aren't going.

These are some obvious reasons for this price difference, and people who have tried this coffee would you mind sharing that if there's a taste difference and also what do you think is it worth to buy this or the bottle has better quality and taste? or I should continue with the sachets.

So, to start off I'm F|20ys old. I graduated from high school in 2023 and went to community college for about less than a semester. I never liked school, I was never any good at it, I was a C and D type of student. Around my 2nd month of college I decided to get my first job at 18 working at a sneaker store at the mall. My mom had always told me throughout high school to focus on school and my grades so she didn't approve of me getting a job until college. I started working and eventually fell away from the whole ""school"" thing and chose to just work instead. When I was in my senior year in HS about maybe 2-3 months away from graduating I met this girl on Tinder who was 19 and in college, eventually we ended up dating and now we're engaged and living with my parents cause she was having some issues at home. We've always been the type of couple that likes to try new things and kind of explore around in our little town. Trying different coffee shops, go to small owned thrift shops, you get the idea. I had quit my job at the mall like 5 months after cause I wasn't getting enough hours. My second job was a delivery driver for medical supplies getting paid under the table. My most recent job was at a small family owned surplus store working part time, my fianc√©e actually helped me get that job. Anyways, around November 2024 I decided I wasn't happy with the money I was making and wanted to go for something bigger. I started talking to buddy of mine to get me into a welding job and long story short that didn't go as planned. Now, a month ago my fianc√©e's best friend who lives about 20-22 hours away suggested I could go work over there with her fianc√© as construction. Obsessed with the idea of making a lot of money and possibly having a good future for me and my fianc√©e I said yes. I was supposed to leave on Friday but last minute I got cold feet and didn't end up going. My fianc√©e's best friend has been telling her that I'm selfish for not going, that I wasted everyone's time, that's I'm too much of a wuss to go and that I'm never going to give her a good future. So more info on my fianc√©e, she's now 21 and is about to graduate from college since she went to an early college high school. She's going to go into a dental program in August and should be getting her big girl job as a dental hygienist in about 1-2 years. Obviously she didn't like me not leaving to go work cause I've been unemployed for about 4 months now. As of right now I have nothing to offer her, I have no money, no job, barely a car. I have nothing. She told me today that she wants to move back in with her mom, she said it's because she feels like my family has a lot to due with the fact that I didn't leave, that she can't look at my family the same, she believes this would help us maybe motivate me. I told her it's okay that I wouldn't be upset. I don't want to disagree with her because maybe she's right. I guess I just feel like I don't deserve her, that I'm holding her back, I'm just a bum, I can't deserve someone as amazing as her. I'm fighting myself that I should just let her go. She has so much potential to be successful. I don't really know how to finish this off, I'm sorry if this was all over the place. I guess I just needed to vent. ",1,1743318747.0,Advice,0,0.99,False

I just hate this place. I havent been to work in three days but I am already fucking SICK of being there. I have this sense of oncoming dread that washes over me. I hate the people I work with, theyre all so chatty and optimistic and are small talk fiends. Not a moment of silence. Empty chatter about ""haha so what do you do for fun? Haha hows the weather haha? Any exciting plans hahaha? You look tired, up all night partying hahhaa? You a student? hshahahahahahaha"". No Im emotionally exhausted on a constant basis. No I actually cried myself to sleep last night but thanks for asking haha! No I actually have been sinking into the darkest parts of my mind lately, but yknow, haha, party animal and all that!

Ive been in a mental episode of sorts and it gets worse and festers every time I step into this fucking building. I cant quit yet but tbh if I get closer to crashing out god knows when my last day will be. My manager is annoying, people I work with are annoying, I would close but it takes too much time out of my day and makes me feel a different kind of depressed. Im just done. I dont know how long I can take it anymore.

I go in and try to trivialize it, like ""Just put the coffee in the cup and then you leave. Put the fries in the bag bro"". Sometimes it works, but tbh it doesnt take away from how aggravating this job is. Its teidous and its made me feel insane. I fantasize about blowing up at my manager in front of everyone and making my grand big exit, and I am free! Fuck you all! Fuck you SM! Fuck you to that one particularly shitty barista! Fuck you to all! I step outside the building with the weight in my chest gone, and the wasp nest thats my mind turns clear. Its a sunny day and I am free! But oh, im now unemployed, and thats a different kind of low. Employment and unemployment is a fucking prison.

To whoever reads this, thank you for your time. I dont even know what I want from this post to be honest, maybe to be heard by fellow people who craft beverages for entitled devilspawn. The fake conversations, the greedy customers, moronic manager, the noise, the volume, the repetitive routine.

You are speaking misery into existence in your thoughts and words. I'm talking to the people who follow r/thanksimcured and love telling there sad story that nobody else understands. Yes you were a victim of life, SO WAS EVERYONE ELSE. There's nothing special about your story. 

If you are triggered by this deeply is because a part of you know it's true, there's a difference between pain sand suffering 

You are not 100% miserable all the time, you laugh, you pet your dog, enjoy a coffee, a movie, many things. 

Everyday may not be good, but there is something good in everyday

So I say to you strong soldier, go forth with strength and diligence, start small, make a 10 minute self care routine, do it everyday no matter what.

* **Why Childfree?**¬†Simple. Love freedom, love my sleep, love spontaneity. Kids are‚Ä¶ not on my life's roadmap. Ever. Plus, have you seen education costs these days? Childfreedom = financial freedom, right?. Plus, I made a Post (I am ChildFree because I am selfish).

1jn6vqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLezistance/comments/1jn6vqs/lesbians_need_to_take_more_initiative/,Lesbians need to take more initiative,"Time and time again I see the same thing. Lesbians either refusing or being afraid of taking initiative. 

Our time is valuable, which means our attention is valuable. We need to be putting more interest into each others hobbies and curiosities even if it bores us to hell. You'll never find the perfect lesbian friendship group that likes all the things you like and behaves all the ways you like. 

If you go to a meet up group, get peoples' numbers and actually reach out for a coffee. Find opportunities for each other, financially and individually. A cup of coffee costs like 3-5$, much more depending on how fancy it is. A walk in the park is free. It will be hard at first but once it's a habit, it will be so much easier. 

The loneliness epidemic will not get better if we don't reach out to one another at least somehow. And we have to be respectful as well. I've met all sorts of lesbians and the ones that everyone stays away from are the hateful ones and the ones with no bounderies. In my experiance they start off really nice but then get depressed and sour off. Just don't be like that. Realize your boundaries, reinforce them, and reach out to others. 

I'm not a guru of any sort and I am quite young, but what I am speaking about is in no way new. It's a tale as old as time. 

What sort of ways do you think you can improve your own lesbian life? 

For myself, I started to reach out to other lesbians more. Even if they don't respond. I started communicating and setting bounderies. I still struggle with doom scrolling but I am much better at it now but social media is still a struggle overall and takes time away from me. I began looking more into lesbian literature and began working on a book club that I hope to make for the group I am in. Even if it doesn't work, I think the effort will make me a better person to be around for other lesbians and in the long term will give me a better ability to recommend books of all genres to lesbians. 

We are all anxious, depressed, angry, and tired. We aren't alone in that unless we allow ourselves to be alone. And I don't wish to be a lonely lesbian any further. ",11,1743317953.0,TheLezistance,0,1.0,False
1jn6vnn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jn6vnn,San Ray - March 2025,"Did San Ray's Sharing dinner menu through First Table with a booking fee of $12.

The nine course tasting menu is originally priced at $85 per person. You have to purchase a drink per person. I got an iced coffee with agave and tonic which was delicious and I've been looking to make something similar at home for a while but haven't been bothered to yet.

Initially I was feeling a bit hesitant because of my experience at Cazador, but I wanted to give them (the owners) another chance (which is very rare for me) and didn't regret it.

&nbsp;

**Mussels, citrus kosho, tomato, white balsamic (2 per person) and kingfish crudo, leche de tigre, makrut lime, crispy shallot, oregano, chilli (extra $28 per person and not discounted):**

After my experience with the kingfish upgrade at Cazador, I knew I was going to get kind of scammed, but my friends wanted to try it so we did.

An extra $28 per person (with no discount) for two or three thinner slices of kingfish each and again, they didn't really have any special flavour to them. The mussels, however, were very nice with a touch of lemon juice. Still didn't make up for the fact the add-on was $28 though.

&nbsp;

**Sourdough, chipotle butter:**

This was freshly baked or at least toasted and came out with a very smooth chipotle butter. I quite enjoyed this and my only comment is that I wish there was a bit more punch to the chipotle butter to make it stand out a bit more (as you're essentially diluting the flavour over the bread)

&nbsp;

**Crudit√©, radish, witloof, carrot, smoked macadamia:**

Literally some vegetables that you eat with a smokey dip. Pass for me

&nbsp;

**Cazador charcuterie - heritage pork coppa:**

This was MILES better than the house-cured koji lonzo I posted about the other day in my Cazador review. Like this is what I expected. Absolutely great deep and complex the flavours I could just keep savouring it. That koji one literally tasted plain in comparison.

&nbsp;

**Wood-fired mushrooms, quinoa, mascarpone, cascabel chilli:**

This was really nice. The mushrooms were super soft and creamy and there was no chewiness to them. The flavours seemed to be reminiscent of each other and perhaps a bit repetitive at Cazador and San Ray, but not surprising given that they're owned by the same people. 

&nbsp;

**Chargrilled pumpkin, sundried tomato, grapes, ancho oil:**

Pretty decent dish. The way they did the grapes strongly reminded me of a savoury apple pie but served with pumpkin instead

&nbsp;

**Chargrilled wagyu bavette, caramelised butter, cognac jus:**

Solid beefy dish that I thought was better than the equivalent protein main at Cazador. Probably better than most fine dining places purely because of the higher quantity and extra use of sauce (I prefer more sauce than less). A bit chewy (because of the cut), but no complaints from me; I don't mind a bit of chewiness if the flavours are good

&nbsp;

**Mixed green salad, jalape√±o, lime, walnuts, sultanas:**

This was surprisingly really good and had liberal amounts of sultanas which gave it the sweetness it needed. Yum!

&nbsp;

**Shoestring Fries, housemade taj√≠n, buttermilk mayo:**

You're all going to laugh at me and might stop reading this review, but these shoestring fries were GREAT. On it's own, they were already super crispy but so-so. HOWEVER, with the buttermilk mayo, that's what we're talking about. Seasoned so well, super crispy, and great flavour with the mayo. That was actually the highlight of my meal ... my friends and I go along with a saying that if a restaurant can do really good fries, it probably shows the quality and effort put into their other dishes hahaha

&nbsp;

**Chocolate & brandy mousse, salted caramel, olive oil, rosemary, hazelnuts:**

Much better than the Cazador one and it felt like it had more substance to it. I couldn't taste and rosemary whatsoever though, so that's my only complaint because I think it would have been even better. Perhaps a rosemary infused olive oil would have brought out those flavours more

&nbsp;

Service was good and like my experience at Cazador, the quality of ingredients were pretty high up the list.
I really enjoyed the meal here and I was super full by the end of it; the portion sizes were a bit bigger and the extra sauces in the dishes were richer or there was more of it, or also because I ate a bit more compared to my friends.


Solid 6.5-7/10 in terms of flavour for me. Happy experience, especially with the First Table pricing :)

But thanks to advancements in AI technology, this surreal scenario is becoming a reality. Recently, I stumbled upon a fascinating video that used AI to recreate a conversation with my younger self. It was both exhilarating and a bit unsettling.

The realism of the AI-generated imagery was astonishing. I found myself staring at a digital version of me from years ago, complete with my youthful quirks and carefree demeanor. It was like peering into a mirror that reflected not just my face, but my memories and emotions from that time. The conversation flowed naturally, with the AI mimicking my younger self's thoughts and feelings. It was a nostalgic trip down memory lane, filled with laughter and introspection.

However, I couldn‚Äôt shake the creepiness factor. There‚Äôs something unsettling about technology being able to replicate our past selves so vividly. It raises questions about identity, privacy, and the ethical implications of such advancements. Are we ready to face our pasts in such an intimate way, or does it tread too close to the uncanny valley?

While I was initially thrilled by the experience, it also made me ponder the implications of this technology.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1jn6kwg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jn6kwg,Day trip to Austin TX and Round Rock!,"Sorry for the long review but had so much fun on our little day trip that I thought I‚Äôd share our experience!

We started at Veracruz All Natural on Cesar Chavez St. 
- Ordered: 
    - One El Tradicional: 8/10
    - One El Breakfast Taco with bacon & chorizo: 9/10
- Overall Experience: 8.5/10 - This place was delicious! The vibe was really nice and the service was great. The menu was a bit confusing and I did pay $20 for 2 medium tacos but it was worth it! Parking was difficult as well. 

Then we stopped at Town Lake. 
- Overall experience: 5/10 - To preface we went on a slightly rainy day so the park may not have been the best idea. The view of the city and the water was great and I‚Äôm sure amazing in the summertime but the main issue was parking. There really just isn‚Äôt much to do on a rainy day at a park. 

Then we went to South Congress and visited Jo‚Äôs Cafe.
- Ordered: 
    - 12oz Latte w/ Oat Milk & Caramel Syrup: 4/10
- Overall Experience: 5/10 - The street is great if you want to shop! There are tons of stores but that‚Äôs just about it. Jo‚Äôs was really cute and the iconic wall was great. Coffee isn‚Äôt really anything special. 

To pass some time we decided to visit the Museum of Illusions!
- Overall Experience: 7/10 - Definitely a fun activity but it‚Äôs fairly small and cost about $25 per person. 

*Stopped at UT to visit some friends. Beautiful campus. Gigantic, tons of food around, a bit overwhelming but great nonetheless*

Rounding out our trip we headed to Round Rock for dinner at Whiskey Cake.
- Ordered:
    - Deviled Eggs: 6/10
    - Cheesy Chicken Melt with Fries 9/10
    - Whiskey Cake: 6/10
- Overall Experience: 9/10 - This place was delicious! The atmosphere was great and the restaurant is very clean and inviting. The food was awesome and everything was well seasoned. The infamous Whiskey Cake was delicious but very very sweet. 

And to finish the day off we ended up at Round Rock Doughnuts!
- Maple Glazed: 8/10
- Overall experience: 6/10 - this place was great! Delicious donuts that definitely stick out from your typical donut. The shop itself is pretty standard but would coke again! 

Day trip consensus: 8/10!

Overall, Austin x Round Rock was nice! It was as if New York took a nap and woke up a bit groggy. The essence is there. Maybe one day I‚Äôll check out the nightlife but for now I‚Äôm satisfied. ",0,1743316540.0,austinfood,2,0.46,False

This is a double-edged sword because while these fans bring strong initiatives, they also set high expectations. On the positive side, they have the resources and organizational skills to pull off large-scale projects like sending coffee or food trucks to events, putting up billboards worldwide, funding plane ads, buses, forming dedicated voting teams, and even organizing massive projects where individual fan sites can raise anywhere from ‚Ç±100K to ‚Ç±600K per member. Again these are projects that are mostly seen in Kpop that was adapted sa Bini

It‚Äôs true that and other kpop gg specially blinks stans have a reputation for being highly competitive, outspoken, and extremely protective of their faves. Some even consider them toxic, especially when it comes to online discourse and fan wars. So these traits gets adapted into Ppop kaya rin nagkakaroon ng reputation ang blooms.

1jn6feh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jn6feh/at_my_wits_end/,At my wits end,"My wife (42f) and I (39m) have been together for nearly 20 years, married for 18. I was in the military for our entire relationship and only recently retired from the service. We have 2 children together who are still preteen/teen.

There is so much context lost for the sake of brevity but here it goes.

We naturally have been separated a lot due to military lifestyle, and because of that our relationship has had several rocky moments, there are naturally past hurts that are relevant but this would turn into a novel if I tried to lay everything out. Most recently I was literally only home 2 days a week for my last 5 years, but we held on. I've only been retired for 3 months, and I knew there would be transition woes, but I wasn't prepared for this.

My biggest complaint over the last few years was a lack of intimacy both physical and emotional, to which she justified that it was easier to manage with me gone so much to maintain a certain level of distance and refrain from becoming too dependent.

Her biggest complaint as I understand from recent talks is that she felt I wasn't helping her around the house enough, and that when she asked me for help, she perceived my lack of support as a big F/U, several times over for the last few years. FYSA, she also works full-time, and she was essentially a single mom while I was away.

I explained to her that I knew I wasn't going nuts with cleaning and such, but I was helping appropriately in my head and that I wanted to spend more time taking her out to dinner or the kids to the movies, etc. She felt otherwise, and explained that she is very VERY resentful toward me because of my perceived lack of effort, and she has been contemplating divorce.

I thanked her for being honest, and I explained to her that I never knew the level of damage I was doing because she never explicitly communicated with me, to which she insisted that I should have known based on the things that she did say. Not playing the mind reader game here, and she may be right, I probably should have but I didn't.

This all started about three weeks ago, and I've been in my own head trying to analyze every possible way I can avert this crisis. We're going to marital therapy soon thank heavens. I am trying to go in with a plan because I want to make a productive and real effort to resolve these past hurts.

Since finding out, I've gone straight ""field day"" cleaning in the house and it is borderline white glove inspection ready. Doing all the laundry, basically all of the house chores across the board. I've been waking up with her to help her get ready for work in the morning i.e., coffee prep, starting the shower (simple things). None of this is too much for me because I am now home retired (at least temporarily).

The wits end part is that, aside from what I've written here, I have little to no idea where her heart is and it's killing me. She doesn't want to talk about it with me, and basically told me to wait until therapy. I'm trying and failing to not think or talk about it because I feel so in the dark, and when I have tried to talk to her, she just shuts me down and says we can't talk about this constantly and asked me to just act normal for now. Recently when I was feeling overwhelmed, I was going to leave the house for a bit and she asked where I was going. I replied ""I don't know, but I can't just sit here like everything is okay."" She didn't like that and asked me to stay and didn't want me to leave, so I stayed and we talked, but it was more or less a rehash of the previous conversation and nothing productive happened. This has happened twice now with the same results.

This was supposed to be a happy time, I'm finally home and we can be a family only for the family unit to just collapse. I'm heartbroken and trying very hard to stay focused on the chores and the kids, but it feels like a losing battle. My daughter keeps asking me why I'm so quiet lately, and I said mom and dad are having a rough time and trying to work on things. I know there isn't much more I can do without being overzealous, so here I am. Looking for what...I don't know, maybe moral support, other perspectives, anything to help for the next week waiting for therapy.

I had a small lightbulb moment that inspired a new prototype product. It's a magnetic puck screen grabber/holder/dropper thing. (I'm still working on the name...) I would love to get some feedback on this idea and see if there's any interest from the community, both Robot owners and non-owners alike.

For some background, I own a Cafelat Robot. As you know, the Robot requires the use of the included puck screen. I assume it's to prevent grounds from backing up into the gauge tube or making a mess of the piston and seals. But the puck screen has this silicone nubbin that you have to grab to gently set it on top of your tamped puck. And after it kept popping out while washing the puck screen, it eventually tore as I kept putting it back in the puck screen. So, I've been using the screen without the nubbin.

The downside is that I'm required to use filter papers to avoid gouging the coffee puck when placing the screen into the portafilter. There's no option to try pulling shots without filters without the nubbin. So, I came up with a way to magnetically lower the screen into the basket and gently release it on top of the puck. You can also use it to pick a screen up before knocking out your basket.

Using the syringe-like design, you can pick up the puck screen with the magnetic end and gently drop it by pressing the plunger. The design contains several pieces, including 3D-printed grip, plunger, and thumb press, stainless steel tubing, spring, and screw, and an anodized aluminum magnet holder.

What do you all think? Is it useful? Would you use one if you had it? What if I had a short, stubby version for traditional-sized baskets found on most other machines? Any refinements or name suggestions? Let's make this into something you all would love!

1jn6cru,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jn6cru/an_account_from_the_deep_florest/,An Account from the Deep Florest,"
Hello everyone at r/nosleep.

My name matters less than the story I need to tell. I am one of the few in my village, here deep in the green heart of the Amazon, who has sporadic access to the internet. I learned your language from outsiders, missionaries and researchers who passed through here, and curiosity has led me to many corners [of the web], including this subreddit. 

I read your stories about strange rules, about creatures in the darkness, about urban terrors. Some give me chills. It's funny to think about our cultural difference. Around here, we are, in a way, 'acclimatized' to fear, as you might say. For us, what you call 'paranormal' or 'supernatural' is just part of the world.

We grew up hearing stories, warnings, lessons passed down by our elders about respect, about boundaries. We know the signs, the sacred places and the cursed ones. Since I was a child, I learned there are places one must not fish after sunset, trees that cannot be cut even when dead, and sounds that must never be imitated. The sounds of the forest change completely after the sun goes down. It's not just the crickets or the frogs. There are snaps of branches no animal would make, whispers the wind carries for kilometers.

The white people think ""paranormal"" is something separate, an intrusion. For us, it's like the air: it's in everything. The spirits are neighbours. The child who gets lost in the igarap√© might return speaking the language of the dead, and this isn't tragedy ‚Äì it's a lesson. The elders teach us to ""read"" the forest. The way the leaves fall, the colour of the water after a heavy rain, the sudden silence of the monkeys ‚Äì all of this has meaning.

But even though I am so different from you, I fear we are all condemned for having become too much alike.

Our people, despite living in the forest and keeping our traditions, our language, our customs, knows about the white man. You gave us technology. Our young people are sent to the city to study. They become literate in the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù language. We share our history with your researchers; your professors come to our villages to do research; your anthropologists are used to interviewing us. The media makes documentaries about us and interviews our warriors. We are like cousins to you. One side has grown accustomed to the other. 

But you need to know that not everyone is like this.

You call them 'the isolated'. The white man's government says it protects their lands, creating zones where no outsider can enter. Thousands of kilometers of dense forest that no one, not even the police or the army, truly knows. Instead of trying to study them, perhaps decipher their language, their culture, the government decided simply to protect them. And watch, from afar. 

This might have been the first mistake. 

Their existence is a fact for us, like an unknown river or a distant mountain in the mist. But we do not understand their languages. The rare sounds the wind sometimes carries from their direction do not resemble any speech we know. Their tracks, when found by chance near the unspoken boundaries, are different. Their beliefs? Their fears? Their guardian spirits? They are mysteries to us, just as much as they are to you. They are peoples whose true names the world has never heard.

We coexist with these peoples. But it's a coexistence of distance and silence. The rule of not entering their territories isn't just for the outsiders who venture here; it applies to us too. For centuries, the instruction was clear: upon hearing their peculiar calls in the forest, upon seeing tracks that are not ours or those of known animals, there is no curiosity. We lower our heads and silently change our course. 

They are the peoples we avoid. But this invisible barrier, this abyss of silence between us‚Ä¶ it feels as though it is erected with the same firmness from their side. It's not the skittish shyness of a forest creature fleeing when seen. It's something intentional. The birds fall silent in a strange way, the sound dies in a wrong way, a silence so absolute it almost sounds like a suppressed scream. That is how we know we are already at the border between our territories, and it's time to turn back.

But of course, it's not always like that. No one is born knowing which steps to avoid, which shadows to ignore. When childhood curiosity leads a little one to point towards that denser part of the woods, or to imitate a strange sound coming from afar, the reaction isn't a legend, not a monster story. It's a sudden silence from the adults around, a stern look that permits no questions, a firm but silent pull on the arm, drawing them away. The question 'Why?' dies on the lips before it's even fully formed. Children learn not by the name of the danger, but by the heavy feeling that emanates from the elders whenever that invisible boundary is even mentioned.

But try to ask, as a child inevitably does, ‚ÄòGrandfather, why did your face get like that when I spoke of the different signs near the dark igarap√©?'. The answer doesn't come in words. It comes in a sudden stiffness in the elder's shoulders, in a gaze that abruptly shifts to the fire or the ground. The paj√©s [shamans] are supposed to have all the answers about the forest, but in that moment, the child learns there are things that have no name in the paj√©s' stories. Things they have decided to ignore and look away from.

And so we lived for centuries. Our peoples on one side, those peoples on the other. Not even colonization changed this. While entire tribes were burned by the colonizer, while Catholic Jesuits dominated and learned our language and the languages of our sister tribes, they remained there. Isolated. Uncontacted. Oblivious to the oppressor's sword. Looking back, I think we should have paid more attention to this. It's not a natural phenomenon. Now, perhaps, it's too late.

It started two days ago, well after the last fire had burned down to embers. 

That's when we heard it. Coming not from afar, as we were used to, but disturbingly close. Not the incomprehensible calls we had each grown accustomed to hearing throughout our lives, but grotesque imitations of sounds. Our sounds. A fragment vaguely resembling the cry of a village baby, but repeated in an unnatural cycle, devoid of emotion. Another sound seemed like a failed attempt to echo the slow rhythm of a shamanic chant, but off-key, broken, as if the very throat producing it didn't understand the melody or purpose. 

It was as if something was dissecting our sounds and trying to reassemble them with the wrong pieces. It seemed less an attempt to 'speak' and more a vocal spasm, a desperate need to expel noise, any noise. It lasted for hours. For brief moments, amidst the chaos, we heard what could have been an attempt at voice. Not words. Tonal fragments, as if something were trying to reproduce the cadence of human speech after hearing it only once, from very far away, distorted by wind and water. 

They were meaningless rising and falling modulations, interrupted by choking sounds or chitinous clicks. It wasn't a message. It wasn't a threat we understood. It was a chaotic outpouring. A leak of sounds from a place where logic does not reside. It was the pure audible manifestation of a desperate need to do‚Ä¶ something, anything, to be perceived, but without the slightest idea how. We spent the entire night awake, huddled in our hammocks, the air thick with fear and the smoke from fires relit uselessly against an enemy that didn't show itself, only sounded. The night was no longer ours.

The air in the village wasn't just heavy; it felt toxic. No one spoke a word. The paj√©s, for the first time in anyone's memory, seemed shrunken, their eyes fixed on the ground as if afraid of finding something in the emptiness. That one night felt like days. But the worst was yet to come.

In the deepest hour of the night, when even the moon dared not peek and the darkness was a palpable weight, the very nature of the noises began to change. And then, peering through the tiny cracks in the walls of our ocas [huts], terror took shape. The sounds had also become shapes, an agglomeration of shadows darker than the night itself. 

They were not the forest spirits we know, nor animals. They were many. And then we could see‚Ä¶ more. Their outlines were fluid, erratic, sometimes seeming almost human in silhouette, at other times unfolding at impossible angles, with limbs that appeared to bend in the wrong places. Their mouths moved, and the horrible sounds we'd heard before ‚Äì the clicks, the wet sobs, the broken static ‚Äì emanated directly from them, a parody of speech so grotesque it turned the stomach. Counting them was impossible; the darkness and fear blurred our vision.

But the true abyss opened when we focused on their faces, or what seemed to be their faces. There was no anger, no hatred, no enemy's bloodlust. There was‚Ä¶ agony. Masks contorted in unspeakable suffering, and from their eyes ‚Äì or the dark cavities where eyes should have been ‚Äì trickled thick, dark, almost oily streaks. 

It was weeping. Unmistakable. The universal language of human pain, coming from beings that seemed anything but human. But why were they crying? Why were they lamenting? Were they mourning our imminent death, even before touching us? Dread paralyzed us in our hammocks, not just from fear of physical pain, but from the nauseating realization: we were witnessing, perhaps even unwillingly participating in, an event of incomprehensible sorrow with no record or precedent in human history.

That profane vigil stretched on for hours that felt like ages, drawn out in the torture of anticipation. 

But the attack never came. There was no movement towards us, no arrow fired, no step crossing the invisible line that separated us. And perhaps that was worse: their faces turned towards us, or maybe through us, in a concentration of suffering so intense it held us pinned in place. Every member of the tribe remained frozen in their oca, breathing as little as possible. The initial fear of a massacre gave way to a different kind of terror: the dread of the incomprehensible, the feeling of being observed, judged, and mourned by beings operating outside any natural or spiritual law we knew.

The night dragged on, dense and starless. The lament continued, a constant, sickening pulse that seemed to reorder the very silence between its waves. And then, almost imperceptibly, a subtle change began. Not in them, but in the world around. A pale, sickly gray began to seep into the eastern edge of the sky, the first hesitant promise of dawn. The lament didn't stop abruptly; it began to unravel, losing its cohesion, the sounds breaking into even more erratic fragments, before finally being swallowed by the growing gray of morning. The dark shapes seemed to retreat, not like an army withdrawing, but like the darkness itself dissolving, receding into the depths of the forest from which they came, leaving behind a heavy silence. 

We waited, motionless, for a long time after the last sound died out and the last flickering shadow disappeared. The sun was already high, burning the sky at midday, before the first of us truly dared to emerge. Only then, one by one, slowly, with the caution of someone treading on mined earth, did we begin to emerge from our shelters into a world that looked familiar, but which we knew, in our bones, had been irrevocably profaned.

The village was silent, except for the almost aggressive buzz of diurnal insects. 

There was no discussion, no meeting of the elders. The first to crawl out of their ocas didn't look at each other; their eyes went instinctively to the small structure of wood and tin that housed our tenuous link to the outside world: the shortwave radio and the satellite internet terminal, gifts from the government after the last bloody conflicts with loggers. 

Without a word, Kael and Tari, two of the youngest trained in the codes and protocols, ran inside. The nervous crackle of static filled the air as Kael tried to establish contact with the military border control base. His voice, usually firm, was a trembling thread: ""Jaguatirica Base, this is Ypyku√©ra, code Red Herald!"" 

There was a loaded silence on the other end, likely shock or disbelief, but the code Arauto Vermelho [Red Herald], reserved for existential threats or unexplained large-scale incursions near the Zones of Protection for the Isolated, prevented any doubt about the seriousness of our distress call.

The response took what felt like a lifetime, but by the clock was just under two tense hours, lived under a relentless sun and a heavy silence broken only by stifled sobs and the anxious murmurs of the elders. Each cloud shadow made hearts leap; each twig snap in the woods sounded like the nightmare's return. Then, a distant sound, a vibration felt more in the chest than heard, began to grow. It became a deep hum. 

Three military transport helicopters, enormous green-metal dragonflies, broke the treeline in tactical formation. They made a low pass over the village, the downdraft whipping leaves and dust into a violent whirlwind, before beginning a coordinated descent into the central clearing. The noise was deafening, a storm of metal and wind that drowned out all other sounds. Even before they fully touched the ground, the side ramps opened, and soldiers equipped for jungle combat ‚Äì camouflage, vests, helmets with dark visors, assault rifles ready ‚Äì began to disembark with trained efficiency. There were dozens. They quickly formed a defensive perimeter, not looking at us, but towards the forest, towards the dark line from where the horror had emerged and where it had retreated.

While the soldiers established the perimeter, weapons at low ready but eyes scanning the treeline, a figure emerged from the third helicopter, the command aircraft. Without the impersonal helmet, without the tense combat stance, we saw a face many of us recognized instantly. It was Commander Galv√£o. For almost twenty years, he had been the face of the Army in our region, a man whose patrols and training exercises were part of the landscape, whose sporadic visits to check borders or mediate minor conflicts were almost routine. 

Galv√£o was procedure, order, the guarantee that the gears of the outside world were now engaged. But there was something in his posture, in the almost satisfied glint in his eyes as he surveyed his men's show of force, that soon caught the attention of the most observant. We knew how it worked: protecting Indigenous lands, especially responding quickly to a distress call like ours, earned points with the government in Bras√≠lia. Showed results. Perhaps for Galv√£o, we were just providing him an opportunity to look competent, ready to burn tractors or arrest loggers.

When those most skilled in the Portuguese language began to recount the events ‚Äì the profane sounds imitating our lives, the fluid, weeping shadows that surrounded us, the lament that seemed a funeral for our own existence ‚Äì Galv√£o's expression changed. The confident smile vanished, but it wasn't replaced by the horror or empathetic urgency we expected. His eyes took on a glint of... apathy? Polished impatience? He listened intently, head tilted, like a doctor listening to the description of a fever dream. 

He listened with formal attention, occasionally nodding to the FUNAI [Govt. Indigenous Affairs Agency] advisor beside him, as if they were comparing mental notes on some obscure tribal phenomenon. The officer was processing, filtering the information through his grid of known threats: guerillas? Smugglers using psychological intimidation tactics? A rival tribe? Nothing fit.

At the end of Tari's account, Galv√£o stroked his chin, his gaze lost for a moment in the green vastness. ""I understand,"" he said finally, his voice calm, but with a tone that sought to reduce the extraordinary to the manageable. ""Atypical situation, no doubt."" He turned to the Paj√©, a calculated gesture of respect.

""Don't you think that maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ they've finally decided to learn to plant something around here, like you do?""

We saw the naked truth then: the Brazilian Army, with its helicopters, its rifles, and its satellites, was prepared to face guerrillas, traffickers, loggers, even a foreign invasion force or insistent missionaries. But it was not prepared for that.

""Right,"" he said, his voice pragmatic. ""The situation is clearly abnormal and your account is troubling. Alpha Platoon, maintain the perimeter and conduct a careful sweep within a three-hundred-meter radius of the village. Document any unusual traces ‚Äì footprints, objects, markings. Photograph everything. But maximum attention:"" he raised a finger, emphatic. ""No, I repeat, NO initiative to follow tracks beyond this initial area or attempt visual contact if anything is sighted. The orders from Bras√≠lia and FUNAI regulations regarding the non-contact policy with isolated groups are absolute. Our job here is to ensure the safety of this contacted village and gather preliminary information for the report. We will not initiate a conflict or a health crisis through recklessness."" 

His explanation was direct, operational. The Army was there to contain the immediate situation in our village, not to hunt ghosts in the forest.

The FUNAI representative, whose badge identified him as the acting regional coordinator, cleared his throat, looking equally overwhelmed but adhering to protocol. ""The Commander is correct. We must follow procedures."" He addressed us, his tone more conciliatory, yet still distant. 

""Our priority now is your well-being. We will arrange for a multidisciplinary team, and you should describe everything to them in as much detail as possible. It would also be important,"" he added, glancing around at the tense faces, ""to conduct a preventative health assessment here in the village as soon as possible, to rule out any risk, however indirect."" He gestured vaguely towards the forest. ""As for‚Ä¶ these entities‚Ä¶ we will request analysis of recent satellite imagery of the area to try and identify unusual movement patterns or unregistered camps. If there are physical traces nearby, we can collect samples for analysis."" He hesitated. ""Regarding the sounds‚Ä¶ installing recording equipment is possible, but requires planning and resources that must be approved. And even then, linguistic analysis of unknown material is a long, uncertain process. But if we record something, we can consult neighbouring ethnic groups to see if they recognize the language or have histories of conflict/communication with the isolated group."" 

Galv√£o intervened, ending the conversation. ""Let's make a report now. The Amazon Military Command will be notified today, along with FUNAI headquarters. They will decide the next steps and the allocation of additional resources, if deemed necessary."" He glanced at his watch. ""We will certainly have measures in place within a few weeks.""

Weeks. 

The word echoed in the silence that followed, cold and inadequate. The white man's world, with its reports, requests, and response times, seemed dangerously disconnected from the night of horror we had just survived and the palpable fear that it would repeat in a few hours. Help had arrived, but it was already leaving. 

At that moment, one of the tribe's elders, not the oldest, nor the wisest, but the one who found the courage to break the silence, stepped forward, his hands trembling slightly. ""Commander,"" his voice was low but charged with desperate urgency. ""With all respect to your orders‚Ä¶ they are not loggers. They don't follow laws. You saw our faces. You heard our accounts. They were here. You cannot‚Ä¶ you cannot leave us alone tonight.""

Galv√£o barely waited for the elder to finish his sentence.

‚ÄúI understand your concern. Truly. But my orders are clear, and my jurisdiction is limited. There is, at this moment,"" he gestured to the silent forest, ""no physical evidence of an imminent threat that justifies leaving a permanent detachment here. We have other areas to patrol, other demands. Resources are limited."" He paused, perhaps noticing the absolute desperation in our eyes. ""What I can guarantee is this: we will keep a dedicated radio channel open directly with my base, 24 hours. Any‚Ä¶ I repeat, any sign of return of the activity you described, use the Red Herald code immediately. We will have a rapid response team on standby.‚Äù

Four hours later, the perimeter sweep was completed. No traces or materials were found. At 16:58 [4:58 PM], we watched, powerless, as the soldiers climbed back into the flying machines, their heavy boots marking our sacred ground one last time. The helicopters lifted, raising another storm of dust and leaves, then moved away, becoming ever smaller dots in the indifferent blue sky, until only the tense silence and the buzz of insects remained. 

They were gone. And night was coming. The abyss between our world and theirs had never seemed so vast, and we were left on the wrong side, alone.

While the elders began to murmur ancient prayers and check the makeshift fastenings on the ocas, the eyes of the younger ones turned again to the small communications hut. In recent years, many men and women from the city had come to us ‚Äì professors, researchers, students with their notebooks and recorders, curious about our stories, our plants, our language. Some had shown genuine respect, a more attentive ear than the officials. With fingers flying over the satellite terminal keyboard, a frantic search began for names, for emails, saved phone numbers, sending short, urgent messages, fragments of the horror we lived through, appeals for any kind of guidance or help that didn't involve waiting weeks for a report.

One of the first lines dialed returned the call 30 minutes later. It was Leandro, an ethnohistory professor from a federal university, a man who had spent months with us years ago, mapping our oral narratives. 

His call was short, direct: he was doing fieldwork with another riverside community, some two hundred kilometers from us by river ‚Äì far, but perhaps not impossibly far. The university would never arrange transport in the necessary time or circumstances, but he offered help if we could find a way to bring him here. 

A new wave of urgency took hold. Kael picked up the radio again, his voice firmer this time, calling Galv√£o's frequency. He explained the situation, the professor's offer, the need for an air pickup to bring him to us. On the other end, Galv√£o's response came with an alacrity bordering on enthusiasm. 

""A civilian expert? Who already knows you? Excellent!"" There was almost palpable relief in his voice. ""I can divert a smaller helicopter returning to base. Give me his exact coordinates. Consider it done. It's good to have an academic on-site to evaluate this‚Ä¶ complex cultural situation. Keep me informed."" The ease with which he agreed confirmed our suspicions: for Galv√£o, this wasn't just help; it was a convenient transfer of an incomprehensible and troublesome problem into someone else's hands. But, at that moment, it didn't matter. A new, fragile hope was on its way.

The small helicopter returned perhaps an hour before the sun began to dip behind the tallest trees, its singular sound less oppressive but charged with a different expectation. From the open door descended Leandro, his familiar face marked by the fatigue of the hurried journey and a genuine concern that contrasted sharply with Galv√£o's detached efficiency. But he hadn't come alone. Behind him followed two other men, also dressed in the practical, worn clothes of those who spend more time in the field than in offices. 

Leandro introduced us to Carlos, a linguist with a sharp gaze that seemed to analyze even our silence, and Rafael, a historian whose specialty was precisely the gaps in history, the peoples and events left out of official records. They had been together on a survey in a community several hours away by boat, documenting traditions dying with the elders. These men gave up their rest, their return to their families in the city, moved by something the Commander might not fully understand: a mix of academic duty, the irresistible pull of the unknown, and the solidarity forged over years of working alongside the peoples of the forest.

While the soldiers had brought brute force and rigid protocols, Leandro and his team brought equipment of a different nature: high-sensitivity recorders, cameras with night vision capability, directional microphones, extra batteries, waterproof notebooks. They listened to our account again, not with apathy or skepticism, but with focused intensity, asking precise questions. To them, the contact attempt by an isolated group in that manner ‚Äì not fleeting, but invasive, ritualistic, charged with alien emotion ‚Äì was a seismic event, something challenging everything known or theorized.

They recognized the sanctity of the non-contact rule, the need not to cross the border. But they also understood that if the border was breached again by them, by those entities of the night, the world needed to know. It had to be recorded ‚Äì their images, their incomprehensible voices. And, amidst the backpacks of recording equipment, there was something else, unpacked discreetly but without apology: two tranquilizer dart pistols, the kind used by veterinarians and biologists to safely sedate large animals, and a few stun grenades, which produce intense light and loud sound to disorient. 

Not the soldiers' weapons of war, but tools from their own experience in the deep forest, useful perhaps against dangers they understood ‚Äì a cornered jaguar, maybe, or an unexpected encounter with invaders. As Rafael checked the mechanism of one dart pistol, the soft click echoing strangely, I saw our Paj√© lower his gaze to the ground, while another nearby elder briefly closed his eyes, an almost inaudible sigh escaping his lips. They said nothing. They didn't need to. It was the same silent language used when a child asks a question that shouldn't be answered: a tacit acknowledgment that, while they respected the professors' intent, they knew in their spirits that darts and bright lights might be like throwing pebbles into the fog against the shadows that wept.

With the sunlight fading fast, painting the sky orange and purple over the canopy, a new dynamic settled over the village. Leandro, Carlos, and Rafael worked with quiet efficiency, positioning their equipment at strategic points. Sensitive microphones were mounted on unobtrusive tripods, aimed at the forest edge like attentive ears; night-vision cameras, small red eyes blinking in the twilight, were fixed to makeshift posts, scanning the approaches to the clearing. There was a professionalism in their movements, but also a restrained tension. 

They spoke in low voices, trading hypotheses ‚Äì perhaps a rare acoustic phenomenon, mass hysteria induced by some unknown environmental factor, or, the most intriguing and dangerous possibility, a genuinely unexplained manifestation of the isolated peoples. While their scientific minds might doubt the oily tears and shifting shapes, they did not doubt the genuine terror in our eyes, nor the magnitude of what such an event represented: any unilateral breaking of the silence by an uncontacted group was a historic and potentially catastrophic occurrence. They needed data, evidence.

As darkness swallowed the village, the plan for the night was set. Kael, with his knowledge of technology and the nervous courage of youth, volunteered to stay in the satellite hut, our only fast link to the outside world ‚Äì and to Galv√£o's promise of rapid return. He took one of the researchers' walkie-talkies with him, the antenna extended. Leandro kept the other, a direct but fragile link across the dark distance between the isolated hut and the village center where he'd set up his observation post. 

""Anything, Kael,"" Leandro said, his voice firm but his eyes betraying apprehension. ""Any strange noise, any movement on the cameras I might miss from here, anything out of the ordinary‚Ä¶ call immediately."" The constant hum of the recorders was a counterpoint to the night sounds beginning to stir ‚Äì the chorus of insects, the croaking of frogs, sounds that the previous night had been precursors to horror. That night, no one would close their eyes. The elders prayed quietly in their hammocks, while the researchers checked connections and batteries, each immersed in their own tense vigil, all waiting, heart tight, for what the forest would bring when the darkness was complete.

The hours dragged by on that second night, each minute an eternity. Outside, the forest breathed, but the familiar sounds seemed distorted by our apprehension. Leandro, Carlos, and Rafael kept watch in one of the larger ocas, the camera monitors casting a ghostly glow on tense faces, headphones capturing every amplified crackle or whisper. The coffee pot was long empty. Our women and elders murmured prayers in low voices, a fragile counterpoint to the researchers' technology. 

Kael, in the satellite hut, broke the radio silence every fifteen or twenty minutes: ""This is Kael. Nothing at my position. How about there, Professor?"" Leandro's reply was always the same: ""All quiet here, Kael. Cameras clear. Recorders registering only‚Ä¶ the night."" But with each call, Kael's voice seemed a little tighter, Leandro's a little more weary.

It was 2:45 AM when the tension snapped. A low beep sounded from Carlos's laptop, a red square flashing over the icon for Camera 4 ‚Äì the one watching the northwest sector, near the forbidden trail to the igarap√©. Everyone's breath caught. Eyes fixed on the grainy, greenish image from the night vision.

It was Kael.

He was outside the communications hut, walking in slow circles near the edge of the trees. But something was terribly wrong. He didn't look scared or alert. His head was tilted towards the invisible sky. His face, when the camera briefly caught it up close, was contorted in a wide smile, almost a grimace, and his lips moved rhythmically, as if telling a long, silent joke to the stars. 

An icy dread swept through the oca. Was he... laughing? A silent, continuous laugh. Kael's mother, in the same hut as us, let out a muffled sob. ""He wouldn't do that‚Ä¶ he's afraid‚Ä¶"" Leandro grabbed the walkie-talkie. ""Kael! Kael, copy? What's going on out there?"" Only static answered. An error beep from the radio display confirmed: No Signal. Out of Range. But he was right there, less than a hundred meters away, laughing alone at the darkness.

A thick, horrible silence fell over the hut, broken only by Kael's mother's quiet weeping. No one knew what to do. Then Rafael, the historian, acted on impulse. ""He's not well! It could be a psychotic break from the fear, we have to help him!"" He grabbed one of the tranquilizer dart pistols, pushed open the woven palm door, and ran into the night. 

""Rafael, wait!"" yelled Leandro, snatching the other radio and a powerful flashlight, rushing after his colleague. ""Carlos, lock the door! Monitor everything! We'll be right back!"" 

All of us ‚Äì Carlos, and the terrified villagers ‚Äì were glued to the monitor. We saw Leandro reach Rafael near Kael's hut. We saw Kael turn towards them, still wearing that wide, wrong smile, and begin to‚Ä¶ sing? A low, guttural sound, in no language we knew. Then, with sudden, unnatural agility, he turned and ran, not towards the village, but into the dense darkness of the forbidden woods, disappearing from the camera's view. 

Leandro and Rafael hesitated for an instant, then followed him. Their flashlight beams danced among the trees and vanished.

Only the audio remained. We could hear Kael's strange, guttural song, now more distant. And then, the horror solidified.

A second voice joined his, hesitant at first, then stronger. It was Rafael's voice. A few seconds later, the third voice, Leandro's. All three were singing together now. But it was no longer Kael's guttural sound. It was a complex, polyphonic chant, full of dissonant harmony and a deep, almost geological sorrow. 

The words were impossible, full of clicks and guttural pops, but undeniably sung with a hideous mix of agony and ecstasy. We heard laughter mixing with sobs within that alien song. Carlos tried to go after them, but the strongest men of the village held him back, their eyes wide with ancestral terror. 

""Don't go! We cannot lose another one!""

That profane chorus continued through the predawn hours, seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere, until, just like the night before, it began to unravel and fade with the first pale rays of dawn. 

No one slept. No one moved until the sun was high in the sky.

When the clock in the hut struck eight in the morning, the elders finally nodded. Carlos, myself, and a few other young men went out, armed with machetes and fear. 

We searched around the hut, on the trail, at the edge of the woods. Nothing. Silence. It was Tari, who had gone straight to the communications hut to check the terminal, who let out a high-pitched scream that cut the air like a blade. We ran there.

Lying on the packed dirt floor, in a tight, unnatural embrace, were Kael, Leandro, and Rafael. Their eyes were open, glazed, and on their faces‚Ä¶ a smile. Wide, serene, almost happy. They were cold. Dead. 

On the computer monitor, the satellite call program screen showed Galv√£o's number, dialed repeatedly, the connection never completed.

Later, the Army medical team, arriving with Galv√£o less than an hour after our new, desperate call, would determine the cause of death: all three, simultaneously, had suffered a massive myocardial infarction. A collective heart attack, in the dark of the forest, while smiling.

That was last night. 

It is now 15:46 [3:46 PM] the next day. The news of the deaths of two university professors and an Indigenous man, found embraced and smiling, spread like wildfire through the white man's world. Except in the media, somehow. 

But our village is no longer ours. It is full of uniforms, white coats, people with badges and blinking equipment. Federal Police, the Army in full force, Galv√£o's entire team, medical examiners, psychologists, and even that organization they call the Cacique Cobra Coral Foundation, whose members watch everything in silence, with eyes I cannot decipher, are here. 

More than three hundred strangers here, setting up tents, analyzing every leaf, every recording, using machines they say can think to decipher the sounds of last night. Galv√£o's relief is gone, replaced by a grim mask of concern and curt orders.

But night is coming again. The birds are quiet today, in a way I do not like. Tari doesn't speak, just weeps quietly in a corner. 

They ‚Äì the white men in charge ‚Äì chose me. They asked me to stay in the communications hut tonight. They gave me a vest, a camera on my chest that they say transmits everything live to a command room in Bras√≠lia and to someplace called langley, via a new antenna they put up in a hurry. They gave me a dart pistol. They say I am the 'first line of observation'.

I know what that means. I know I am going to die tonight. They don't tell me what they've found out, but I am the only one here who understands their language when they speak quietly, thinking no one is listening. I heard one of the Foundation men talking to Galv√£o on the radio just now. His voice was calm, cold. He said: ""Yesterday, same time frame, an alert came via Interpol. An anthropology team in New Guinea made an emergency contact. A local uncontacted group surrounded their camp. 

They were‚Ä¶ weeping‚Äù.

Im barely on unit 4 btw,so there might be more problems.It also,for some reason,does not teach you of the rules of grammar until section 2 (atleast thats what it says),so I wondered if all these things are also for the english version of german learning.",2,1743315489.0,duolingo,1,1.0,False
1jn6ah9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jn6ah9/aio_i_feel_like_my_friendship_is_over_after_my/,AIO I feel like my friendship is over after my friend canceled on me,"I feel super childish and ridiculous, so I'd really like some outside perspective. I know this sounds like we're still high schoolers, but I assure you we are two fully grown adult women. There's a bunch of other stuff too, but this is already a novel, so I only included the big stuff. TL;DR at the end since this is way too long (sorry).

For context, I (26F) have been friends with Lydia (26F, fake name) since middle school. We were super close in high school, and she even convinced me to do a program that let me go to college and get an Associate's degree while in high school (I often joke around saying it was the best peer pressuring I've ever had lol). We're from very different backgrounds, but it never really seemed to affect our friendship. That being said, there have been times I have felt a little bit left out. Her family is very affluent, whereas my family has been living paycheck to paycheck my entire life. When I first went to her house she took me out to her balcony and said, ""your house is down there"" and when we came back in her mom asked if she had ""shown me my house yet"" which I found pretty funny at the time, but it seems like she often brings up money to exclude me.

She has gone to Disneyland for her birthday with her friends twice in our time being friends, and I wasn't invited either time. I didn't ask her why the first time - I didn't have the money to go anyway. I was fresh out of high school with no savings, and my sister had just had a baby so my parents weren't in a position to help fund a trip like that. The second time happened after she graduated from uni. When I asked her why she didn't invite me for the second time she told me she ""thought I would be working"" which was really painful. I could have asked for time off if she just asked, and I would have loved to spend time with her. After that I thought that maybe we could go on a road trip to a dairy farm (she loves cows) so we could still have some time together for her birthday, but when I invited her she told me she was ""all tripped out.""

At one point, when she came back home on break (I worked and went to a local community college, she went to a university hours away) she forgot that we had plans. Instead of being honest about it she tried to lie. The excuse she gave was that she didn't have a ride to go to the coffee shop we were going to meet at, which was ridiculous because I could pick her up no problem (she lived literally 5 minutes away, I have a car), and instead of just owning up to it, she told me that I shouldn't bother and she just couldn't hang out. I started to distance myself after that, but we still kept in contact.

Once she came back after getting her degree, we ended up rekindling our friendship. We went out to eat a lot, and enjoyed each other's company. The other thing I need to mention here is that I'm fat. I've tried working out, eating better, and a bunch of fad diets, and yup. Still fat. When I started dieting, I knew I couldn't go out to eat with her as much anymore. When I told her about going on a diet all she said was ""let me know when you're done dieting so we can hang out."" I should have said something about how that made me feel then, but I didn't because I felt embarrassed that I had to be dieting in the first place (she's naturally thin). After a while, I decided to go off my diet and we started hanging out again. I asked if maybe we could play video games together in addition to the eating and shopping (I'm still not really well off, so I wanted to do something that didn't cost money). She isn't a huge gamer, but she plays halo with her sister sometimes and Stardew with her boyfriend. I love Stardew (I have it on PC, Switch, and PS), so I mentioned it, and she said she ""liked how we hang out now,"" and I dropped it.

More recently, she started looking for an apartment to move out of her parent's house. I was super excited for her, and we went shopping together multiple times to try to find the best stuff for her new home. We toured places and finally found a good one. She signed the papers for the apartment, but still had one more apartment tour scheduled. I asked her if she was going to cancel it, but she said no, that we should still take a look at it. Okay, cool! I'm happy if you're happy. A few days later she told me that she invited Briella (also fake name). Briella and I used to be friends, but she did some out of pocket stuff when we were in high school and I kind of just stopped talking to her. Lydia saw almost everything Briella did in high school, so it's not like she didn't know we weren't exactly buddy-buddy anymore. Given the history I wasn't thrilled about it, but it was Lydia's thing, so I was willing to suck it up. Then she said we were having brunch together, and she was picking us both up. Once again, not thrilled to be spending so much time with Bri (or being trapped in a car with her), but whatever. Then she tacked on IKEA which, for some reason, finally made me say something. I told her that I didn't feel comfortable being around Bri for that long, I didn't sign up to hang out with her in the first place, and I would be willing to talk about why I'm so uncomfortable around Bri the next day via phone call if she wanted. She replied with ""I'll cancel the IKEA thing."" As an avid reddit user, I really wanted to say ""the Iranian yogurt isn't the issue here,"" but I went with ""IKEA isn't really the issue."" She told me if I wasn't comfortable with Bri I could just not go, so I didn't. I wished her and Bri the best, and told her I hoped they had a great time (I wasn't being sarcastic, I really meant it).

Also, I know this is super small, but my mom went out of her way to make cookies using a pretty unique recipe that was passed down from my great-great-grandmother for her and her family, and she told me she didn't even try them.

Anyway, after all of that, I kind of stopped messaging her. She messaged me from time to time and I'd give small answers, but any time she tried to hang out I told her I was busy. I really didn't know how to talk to her anymore. Eventually she told me she missed me, and I told her I missed her too, but we needed to have a conversation about our friendship, and it's the kind of conversation that needs to be in person or over the phone. She told me she was going to be busy for the next two full weeks, but she could talk in two weeks in person or on the phone any time. I told her I can wait (I realized I really needed to talk face to face), and asked if the 29th (today) worked for her. She said yes. Well, I texted her yesterday to confirm that we were still on for today, and all she had to say was that she ""had a thing"" and she couldn't meet. To be fair to her, she said she could talk tomorrow, but I already have plans to join a protest, so I can't. I am just so disappointed. I wanted to have a chance to clear the air and maybe move on and continue being friends, but it feels like she gave me the last big fuck you to end our friendship. We set a date to meet two whole weeks ago and she couldn't even keep the one day we set to talk open. I feel so disillusioned, but I also feel like this is so irrational. She said she could meet me tomorrow. Maybe something serious came up. But all she had to say for herself was ""I have a thing."" She didn't say there was an emergency, just that she had ""a thing."" This whole situation feels like the culmination of years of her putting everything and everyone else first. I didn't even respond to her. I don't even know what to say.

TL;DR: After feeling like I've been left out of stuff and feeling like a low priority, I finally decided I needed to try to talk to my friend about it, and my friend canceled on me without any explanation other than she ""had a thing.""
