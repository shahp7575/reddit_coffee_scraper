1ocu8ly,https://i.redd.it/6h7i5zp3yjwf1.jpeg,Review #41: Black Wick Bourbon Whisky by Powdermen Spirits,"Black Wick Bourbon Whisky by Powdermen Spirits

Distillery: Powdermen Spirits Company

Age: 3 days (trigger warning: this is an accelerated aged bourbon from a nano distillery, see summary for more information)

Price: $39.99 (375ml bottle)

Proof: 80

Nose: Heavy corn, slightly sweet but definitely bready, grainy, and mashy. Ethanol is there more so than expected for only an 80 proofer. I don't mind it, but I'd imagine the cask strength version of this would be a little strong. Slight citrus: orange zest and lime. It's bizarre because the accelerated aging process put so much color into this bourbon in only 3 days and yet the nose is still pretty white doggy.

Palate: Feel like we cross the territory into the flavors of a more standard aged bourbon here. Thinner mouthfeel. Slightly nutty....hazelnut. Tobacco. Dusty oak. Big time coffee grounds. Deeper, earthier flavors all the way around for the palate.

Finish: On the shorter end, but longer than expected for the proof. Slightly sweeter than the palate, but still far from sweet. Dark cocoa, toffee, and honey. Almost like a dark chocolate Toblerone. The tobacco and coffee grounds from the palate linger through the end of the finish. Pretty nice actually.

Score: 5.0

Summary: So this is without question the most unusual and controversial bottle I've reviewed. Powdermen Spirits is a nano distillery in the northern Connecticut area. When I say nano I mean the entire operation takes place in one small room and they have put out less than 20 barrels in their existence. Some of their longer aged barrels have apparently been very well received, but in order to get product out to start making some money they made the decision to experiment with some accelerated aging with heat to try an impart the color, nose, flavor profile, and viscosity of a standard aged bourbon in a microscopic fraction of the time. The whiskey purist in me makes it hard to love what they're doing, but the human in me understands craft/micro/nano distilleries usually don't have the time and money to pump out 10 year old barrels left and right. And to quote the great Tommy Pickles...""A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do."" In addition to their standard aged barrels I believe they have put out some barrels aged a few months, 1 month, a few weeks, and finally 3 days. This is the 3 day version so definitely the craziest of the lot. To be honest I was super impressed with the color, and the mouthfeel was nice especially for the proof point. The nose was a big let down for me, but the palate and finish were nice. Dark flavors, but nicely done. I truly didn't mind it. I know this won't be everyones cup of tea (and it's not mine either), but if I tasted this in a blind I would have thought it was drinkable and perfectly fine. Splitting the uprights with a 5.0 here. Grading this on final product, not the process of getting there.

And yet, here I am, trying to convince myself life‚Äôs still kinda awesome. Because what‚Äôs the alternative? Cry all day? Been there, done that, got puffy eyes and a headache.

So instead, I find myself laughing at the absurdity of it all. Like, wow, universe, really? That‚Äôs your next trick? Cute. I‚Äôm not even surprised anymore. I‚Äôve reached that stage of enlightenment where I just sip my coffee and accept that chaos is my co-star in this tragicomedy called life.

1ocu6ni,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocu6ni,Vitis,"The very name *Vitis* (Latin for ""grapevine"") shares its ancient linguistic roots with *vita*, meaning ‚Äúlife.‚Äù¬†

Raw grapes are 81% water, 18% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and have negligible fat. The second image on this post is Kirlian photography of a sliced grape, which captures the high electric charge emitted by this humble fruit due to its high concentration of structured water.

Grapes have a pH of around 3.4, meaning they are acidic. They are considered alkaline-forming when metabolized by the body.

From Hilton Hotema in *Man's Higher Consciousness*:

""The acid-alkali balance of the body has a vital significance. When the alkalinity of the blood falls, the organism dies.

This balance between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the cells (the electric potential) is essential to animation, and supplies the vitality of the living process itself. Its reduction to zero produces death.

The cell of the body is bi-polar, a miniature battery, whose nucleus is the positive pole and the cytoplasm is the negative.

The cytoplasm of the cell surrounds the nucleus and is the negative (alkaline) element. The nucleus is the positive (acid) element. The cytoplasm is a colloidal solution of alkaline minerals. This makes the cell a bi-polar mechanism.

The essential characteristics of vitality manifested in the cells, as assimilation, growth and generation, depend not upon food, but upon the presence of an electric potential produced by oxidation. The various functions of the organs are due to a variation of the potentials.

The foods we eat form acids, and the acids reduce the alkalinity of the cytoplasm, thus reducing the cell‚Äôs electric potential. This means reduced capacity of the cell to respond to cosmic rays, which means mineral deficiency and physical weakness.

We attempt to overcome the condition by eating mineral-rich, alkaline fruits, They introduce alkalies into the blood that temporarily neutralize the acid toxins, causing the cytoplasm to become more alkaline, and the cell‚Äôs electric potential increases, It regains its capacity to assimilate minerals from cosmic rays. Then the dietetic expert steps in and gives the fruit the credit, asserting that the minerals of the fruit were transformed into cell minerals.

That is erroneous and just more dietetic nonsense, The minerals of the fruit are largely eliminated through the bladder, in the form of neutral salts, by combination with acid toxins. Practically all the minerals of foods are eliminated in the urine in the form of neutral salts.""

**The juice of grapes contains structured water which hydrates the cells.**  
  
Limewater/mineral water causes ossification and degenerates the organs, causing calcification of various parts of the body including the pineal gland. Unstructured water carries no electric charge and cannot hydrate the cells properly. Grapes contain structured water which can enter the cells and hydrate them when toxins and acids are discharged.

**The skin and acids of grapes pull biofilms, microplastics, and heavy metals from the body. This small little fruit is a known laxative and qualifies as an enema when consumed in large enough quantities.**

**Grapes will expel the pounds of sludge which reside in the bowels of every person who consumes the foods of civilization.**

# Vitality

Due to the immense electric charge held by the structured water in grapes, the cells can quickly begin detoxification while continuing to have energy for enhanced functioning.

A grape or grape juice diet will alkalize the body, and when all toxins are expelled, weight loss will cease, and the body will begin building new mass as phosphorus concentration increases.  
  
**Grapes possess little flesh and thus inhibit the body the least out of any natural fruit. They are completely mucusless, and have no properties that would destroy the components of broken down semen in the bloodstream.**

Grapes keep the blood alkaline, they digest quickly so they do not ferment, and they have little sodium. This prevents their components from dissolving circulating lecithin in the bloodstream.

In Ehret‚Äôs philosophy, Vitality = Power - Obstruction. With the least obstruction achieved through a grape juice diet, we arrive at Vitality = Power. The human body is constantly secreting seminal fluid in some form or another. The word seminal means the seed of **development**.

This is most certainly the case in the female as well, with Bernard stating:

‚ÄúThe uterus and vagina contain glands that produce a secretion in addition to that of the ovaries. The lymphatic vessels surrounding these organs constantly absorb this vital fluid to enrich the blood and invigorate the nervous system. By living on a natural diet and maintaining the body in perfect health, no seminal fluid or blood will ever be discharged from the female sexual organs.

\[...\]

The secretions of the uterine, vaginal and Bartholin glands, as well as those of the ovaries, have an important internal function. They should never be allowed to escape. This loss of vital energy (whether through orgasm or through leucorrhoea or the mucus discharged during menstruation) devitalizes the body, leading to premature atrophy of the ovaries (menopause and senility). The main cause of this mucous discharge from the vagina is wrong diet. Its prevention depends on eliminating from the diet meat, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy products, white sugar, cooked foods, coffee, tea, salt, bread and cereals. By thus eliminating the dietary cause of the discharge of uterine mucus, menstruation will automatically disappear.‚Äù  
  
Thus, seminal fluids are produced among all members of the race.

**The seeds of development are constantly growing within us. The human body is a dynamo, an organic machine which produces light (energy) from nothing. The objective of the system is to harvest this energy etherically and physically.**

On a grape juice diet, the body is completely uninhibited and nerve power (light) does not have to deal with any grape flesh, instead going to nourish every organ and thus we reach our full energetic capabilities. Siddhis are attained, and seminal production reaches its peak.

**The phosphorescent glow in the eyes and skin is most quickly achieved through a grape or grape juice diet.**

The state of vitality which we all subconsciously seek is due to the accumulation of power, light, the most refined form of seminal fluid.¬†

By cleansing the lymphatic system and alkalizing the cells, seminal fluid secretion is maximized, and the internal secretion is resorbed quickly through the revitalized nadis.

High protein/mucus forming diets are the cause of semen emission. Semen emission by any means: sex, masturbation, wet dreams, or whatever. All these things are like symptoms of a disease. When we say someone had sex or a wet dream, we should treat it as seriously as we do when we say someone got an ulcer or their kidney failed.

Sex is a dysfunction of the human organism resulting from chemical stimulation through food.¬†

By ending irritation of the intestines and sexual centers through a grape or grape juice diet, the symptom we call sex completely disappears.

The phosphorus conservation allows vigor to fill each organ and enlarge the bones, muscles, and spiritual centers of the brain.¬†

I met this 32 year old off FB dating. SMOKING HOT. Like what the hell. I called her and it was a little intimating with her dropping her standards and no time for bs and how good she is. She wasnt rude or arroggant tho just strong self worth.

She pulls up in a fat mercedes SUV.

1octzp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1octzp3/cat_owners/,Cat owners,"We bought our home two years ago and all two of those years we've been dealing with a cat problem. Our neighbors let 3/4 of their cats roam outside. One of them is at my house almost all day roaming my yard, coming up on my porch both front and back.  

Here's my issues 

-Front porch smells like male spray and urine and now I'm wondering if they pee on my back porch too because every summer we have a crazy amount of flies swarming despite cleaning it every spring (under deck is dry no stagnant water)

- they knock over my pots

- cat fights wake me up somewhat frequently at night 
- they set off my security all day and night so I'm having to replace battery constantly 

- most recently my husband and I pressure washed, sanded and then stained our deck hoping to rid the cat smell and it left cat prints in the finish because their cat walked right through it when it was drying over night 

- they use our yard as a litter box 

- my son is highly allergic to cats in fact he has an EpiPen for it just in case because his face swelled up last time he had contact with a cat 

I know what is driving them to come over here. There is a sticker Bush right behind my house where a bunch of birds live so I think that is some of their food source. I dropped hints that their cats were a problem. Well not me and my husband did but I guess he was not very direct and they did not pick up on the social cue. I ended up calling animal control and they did give them a warning and after that the wife was extremely upset with me.  She said she will try her best to keep her cat inside but she's missing the point. I don't want her cats in my property at all. Where I live there is a leash law and cats are not supposed to trespass onto other people's property. In fact, they could be fined for the property damage that has already occurred. But I'm not that kind of person. I just genuinely don't understand how they do not see an issue here. 

Am i wrong here? 

I have also tried just about everything I can from orange peel, sprays, vinegar, coffee grounds, pepper flakes. We also have a motion sensor that plays a god-awful sound and that doesn't do anything either. I've looked into fence linings but apparently that has not helped others in this situation. What would you do in my issues? If all your neighbor keeps saying is they will try their best? ",2,1761093309.0,Pets,1,1.0,False
1octz48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1octz48/aitah_for_refusing_to_eat_and_throwing_away_my/,AITAH for refusing to eat and throwing away my food that a farter just prepared for me?,"I'm not even kidding. This is absolutely ridiculous but I felt I would post this because I genuinely want to know if I'm a big fat jerk head? Here's the context. 

I was sitting and working through my meal and eating, thank goodness I only had peas left of my veggies.. And the guy who made me the food pushed a fart out. It wasn't an accidental slip it was one of those gotta work hard to work it out at least that's how it sounded to me I was instantly grossed out and I promptly put my plate down and said ""THAT'S DISGUSTING! My Grandma would have slapped you.""

He said ""then slap me"" 

I said ""I said my Grandma would have, I won't.""

I told him ""it's horrible manners to fart when people are trying to eat, there was no reason for that, you can take yourself out the room and go elsewhere to do that.""

He told me ""you're blowing this out of proportion."" 

Then I got up and went and threw my food away in the trash. He said ""wow.""

I then asked ""is that what you wanted was for me to not finish my food?""

He said ""yea I was like I'm gunna make sure I make this food, then fart, so that she can't eat.""

This man... I do not understand the gross behavior. He also has dirty fingernails most of the time, I have to get after him to clip his nails. He is 33 years old BTW. He has blades for toenails. Why, is he going to need them as weapons or something? Those things look like they could take out eyeballs. It's not my business I know that but I've offered to clip his toe nails, I've been in Healthcare all of my adult life so I don't mind. We've known each other for years so it's fine just get those gone! 

He never brushes his teeth. He covers his floor in empty Gatorade bottles, dirty socks and underwear, clothing such as pants that he leaves his spedecial military belt on, then has told me to not pick them up because they're not dirty and he will wear them again. I have told him before, that if I see clothing on a floor I assume it is dirty because it's absolutely not normal to throw clothes on a floor that you're going to wear again that's nuts to me. I also struggle with three different types of OCD. So maybe I'm the one with the issue eh? Idk I didn't make me. God did. He got irritated with me because I guess he went to go wear his floor pants with the SPEDECIAL BELT and they weren't there, the belt was hanging up and laundry was going. I told him SORRY NOT SORRY but if I see clothing on the floor it's dirty bro. 

Then he has a dirty vehicle and refuses to clean it, it's full of dust and cups from coffee and trash. The back floor board is made of trash and cups. Or cans from energy drinks and things like that. 

The other day I had to borrow his car.. I wanted to face palm my face into the steering wheel but that's too dirty to do so. BLECH! My vehicles never look like that and you know he's not the first person I've met who keeps a vehicle like that. I have known several people male and female who keep nasty dirty vehicles. 

Usually I'm the one who is to make meals here I usually do a lot of the chores and things but I started a new job where some days I work 12 hour shifts as a home health aid, I'm dealing with a disc issue in my spine so I've been in a lot of pain and today I didn't get out of bed. I slept because pain is exhausting and I don't take pain meds because I like more natural alternatives so I use a heating pad. I try and do stretches and things like that and am in process of seeing specialists and doing physical therapy. Which is just so annoying. I hate when my body puts me down. I like to keep going and going. I prefer to make meals and clean for the people here, they all work. This guy in particular he works as a lumber jack which I totally get but come on man. I've had to work full time and then come home clean and make sure many other things are done and laundry is done and folded. I don't even let this guy clean the shared bathroom because he just apparently can't or doesn't see details idk. I told him he'd be fired as a housekeeper. I'm a very blunt person. I say it how it is I probs should be more gentle but this guy doesn't get hints. A lot of peeps don't get hints. I don't let the guy fold laundry because well I'm picky. I like the towels folded a certain way for shared bathroom plus most of the towels are my own towels. The rack needs them folded just so, so that they fit. 

So again I'm just asking for sure if I am actually the a hole here? I might be I know I can be well idk the word but picky maybe that's the word? Maybe I need meds for my OCD issues, I used to get on my kiddos for their hair, all the hygiene stuff allllll of it! I am even on the dog to want to grind doggie nails down and coat is brushed, want to clean her ears, eye boogies the whole shabang. You see so it could be me I just think hygiene is super important. 

Long story short for those who don't want to read : I threw away food because guy with gross manners farted while trying to eat and told me I blew it out of proportion and he has bad manners anyways and bad hygiene and is also lazy. ",0,1761093264.0,AITAH,5,0.25,False

Last night, I could not get my statue armature out of my mind and so instead of doing nothing, I went back upstairs, not long after I wrote to you, to start over like I said I'd start to do today. It went shockingly well. Everything I thought I needed to do to improve the old version has worked out wonderfully. I doubled the wires with a twist braid and now it can hold its own weight and maintain a pose far better and I've changed the design to make it easier to ass bulk to it later. It was going so well that I brought it back downstairs to keep working on it and I ended the night with almost as much of the second version built as I got with the first. All I was missing was the wings.

Today, I wired the wings. I based the anatomy on a picture of a bat skeleton. Peach sat with me while I was working and she was having a great time attacking the wires while I was twisting. I have to take great care that she didn't nip at a sharp point and hurt herself. When she was bored of that, she went to the corner chair and took a nap. It was a nice time being in my office with her again. The wings are a little heavy but tomorrow, I'll add some support wires and then proceed to bulk the whole thing up. I'm hoping we can get to the actually sculpting within two days. I am very happy with myself, especially because I was just as prolific with my writing. I wrote 693 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. I don't have much new to report on that front, we're still stuck in the same scene and will be for a little while longer, but I'm glad to say I've gotten back into the swing of things after my 5 day break to prepare the office. As you know, I wasn't expecting it to take me so long. Still, I'm satisfied on all fronts.

Tomorrow is Mother's birthday. I have all her gifts prepared. Here's hoping it will be a good day. Until then, I'm going to relax for the night. The autumn chill has arrived and more now than ever I am looking forward to my evening coffee.

1octs4n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1octs4n,Last Bites: The Final Meals of Notorious Criminals,"Throughout history, few traditions are as morbidly fascinating as the condemned prisoner‚Äôs last meal. It‚Äôs a ritual that combines humanity and finality‚Äîone final act of personal choice before justice is carried out. From serial killers to war criminals, these final requests reveal something about the people behind history‚Äôs darkest deeds.

  
**Ted Bundy**, one of America‚Äôs most infamous serial killers, declined to choose a final meal before his 1989 execution in Florida. He was given the standard fare: steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast. It was an unremarkable end for a man whose crimes were anything but.

**John Wayne Gacy**, the ‚ÄúKiller Clown‚Äù who murdered 33 young men, feasted on fried chicken, shrimp, French fries, and strawberries before his 1994 execution‚Äîreportedly echoing his past as a KFC franchise owner.

**Timothy McVeigh**, responsible for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, made a strangely childlike choice: two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Executed in 2001, his meal seemed chillingly detached from the scale of his crimes.

**Aileen Wuornos**, whose killing spree inspired the film¬†*Monster*, declined food entirely and asked only for a cup of coffee before her 2002 execution. Her calm refusal reflected the hardened fatalism she expressed in her final interviews.

**Adolf Eichmann**, the Nazi bureaucrat who oversaw the Holocaust‚Äôs logistics, had just one request in 1962: a bottle of dry red wine. He drank it alone before being hanged in Israel‚Äîhis death marking the end of one of history‚Äôs most methodical murderers.

**Velma Barfield**, convicted of poisoning six people, became the first woman executed in the U.S. after the death penalty‚Äôs reinstatement. Her final request was simple: cheese doodles and a Coca-Cola‚Äîsnacks that seemed almost disturbingly ordinary.

**Ricky Ray Rector**, executed in 1992 for two murders, ordered steak, fried chicken, cherry Kool-Aid, and pecan pie‚Äîbut left the pie uneaten, saying he‚Äôd ‚Äúsave it for later.‚Äù The haunting remark underscored his diminished mental state.

**Victor Feguer**, executed in 1963 for kidnapping and murder, chose a single olive with the pit still inside. He reportedly hoped an olive tree would grow from his grave‚Äîa small symbol of peace from a man condemned for violence.

**Thomas J. Grasso**, executed in 1995, demanded an extravagant meal of seafood, ribs, milkshakes, pie, and SpaghettiOs‚Äîbut later complained that prison staff gave him spaghetti instead. His final words included the grievance: ‚ÄúI did not get my SpaghettiOs.‚Äù

1octqtk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1octqtk,Last Bites: The Final Meals of Notorious Criminals,"Throughout history, few traditions are as morbidly fascinating as the condemned prisoner‚Äôs last meal. It‚Äôs a ritual that combines humanity and finality‚Äîone final act of personal choice before justice is carried out. From serial killers to war criminals, these final requests reveal something about the people behind history‚Äôs darkest deeds

**Ted Bundy**, one of America‚Äôs most infamous serial killers, declined to choose a final meal before his 1989 execution in Florida. He was given the standard fare: steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast. It was an unremarkable end for a man whose crimes were anything but.

**John Wayne Gacy**, the ‚ÄúKiller Clown‚Äù who murdered 33 young men, feasted on fried chicken, shrimp, French fries, and strawberries before his 1994 execution‚Äîreportedly echoing his past as a KFC franchise owner.

**Timothy McVeigh**, responsible for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, made a strangely childlike choice: two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Executed in 2001, his meal seemed chillingly detached from the scale of his crimes.

**Aileen Wuornos**, whose killing spree inspired the film¬†*Monster*, declined food entirely and asked only for a cup of coffee before her 2002 execution. Her calm refusal reflected the hardened fatalism she expressed in her final interviews.

**Adolf Eichmann**, the Nazi bureaucrat who oversaw the Holocaust‚Äôs logistics, had just one request in 1962: a bottle of dry red wine. He drank it alone before being hanged in Israel‚Äîhis death marking the end of one of history‚Äôs most methodical murderers.

**Velma Barfield**, convicted of poisoning six people, became the first woman executed in the U.S. after the death penalty‚Äôs reinstatement. Her final request was simple: cheese doodles and a Coca-Cola‚Äîsnacks that seemed almost disturbingly ordinary.

**Ricky Ray Rector**, executed in 1992 for two murders, ordered steak, fried chicken, cherry Kool-Aid, and pecan pie‚Äîbut left the pie uneaten, saying he‚Äôd ‚Äúsave it for later.‚Äù The haunting remark underscored his diminished mental state.

**Victor Feguer**, executed in 1963 for kidnapping and murder, chose a single olive with the pit still inside. He reportedly hoped an olive tree would grow from his grave‚Äîa small symbol of peace from a man condemned for violence.

**Thomas J. Grasso**, executed in 1995, demanded an extravagant meal of seafood, ribs, milkshakes, pie, and SpaghettiOs‚Äîbut later complained that prison staff gave him spaghetti instead. His final words included the grievance: ‚ÄúI did not get my SpaghettiOs.‚Äù

**Gary Gilmore**, who reopened America‚Äôs modern era of executions in 1977, ate a hamburger, baked potato, hard-boiled eggs, coffee, and whiskey. His final words, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it,‚Äù became infamous‚Äîlater inspiring Nike‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust Do It‚Äù slogan.

I haven't had a girlfriend in 6 years, and even that lasted for 3 months. I'm physically disabled, Indian, and 5'5"". My routine consists of going to work, eating, and sleeping. For those who say go to the gym, my physical disability makes me pretty exhausted, and I need 4 coffees a day at least to stay awake, so that's pretty much a no-go. I usually get off work at 6 or 7pm. I earn a decent amount of money and have lots of money. I don't have a lot of friends, and have no siblings and first cousins, so I tend to be more introverted but can be extroverted after I meet someone. 

I do have pros. I have lots of hobbies such as going to the movies, playing tennis on the weekends or after work, playing video games, travelling. I enjoy museums and history. I love watching sports. People describe me as funny and quirky but in a good way? I would describe myself as lean, athletic, and fast. My looks are probably a 7-8/10 if you ignore my height. I speak only english and some french. 

I've tried the dating apps. I have bumble premium and get a like once every 2 weeks to a month on average. Most people I reply too don't respond cause they are new to the app so probably get like 50 guys liking them. I am not that picky. I've probably gotten to a first date 3 times over the last 5 years but no one I really gelled with. I don't really swipe on girls significantly taller than me, the last girl that liked me that was taller than me said she didn't realize my height and then unmatched. It was pretty deflating so I tend to stay away from tall girls. Since I don't have many friends, it's pretty much impossible to be matchmade or set up. 

I'm not good at gathering signals. A girl seems to be into me (she seemed really cheery and happy), maybe its just her personality, but she's 6'3"" so I'm probably wrong, but she's pretty. We played tennis together. I'm not sure if she likes me. I fear I'll just be rejected again and maybe lose a hitting partner. I've often had girls be cheery and happy around me and eventually bring up that they have a boyfriend during the conversation. 

I just don't know if there's a point in trying anymore due to my lack of success. It feels like its so easy for everyone around me to get a girlfriend except for me. I'm so tired and exhausted everyday. I just wish I had a partner to go through this life with.

1octo16,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1octo16/my_23m_fianc√©_wants_me_to_talk_about_my_22f/,My (23M) fianc√© wants me to talk about my (22F) health problems less - what can I do?,"Hi everyone,

TL;DR at the bottom but I think the detailed post might answer most questions.

I (22F) am going through a rough patch in my engagement and I'd love to get a fresh, unbiased perspective on whether there's anything I can do differently to be less of an emotional burden on my fianc√© (23M). We're hundreds of miles apart but up until recently we've been doing well. I decided to check in with him last night and ask how he felt things were going between us. I was really surprised by his answer. He was very open and honest, which I appreciate, and he said that he didn't think we were doing well (partially due to the distance). He has also been questioning whether he could handle some cultural differences between us. For context, he's from a western part of India. I'm American and my mom is from Belarus. I asked him today what he meant by cultural differences. One of the things he described was differences in upbringing. He said that he always tries to be thankful in all circumstances and that even if he has a lot of problems going on, he tries to be grateful instead of complaining. That he has trust in God's plan and that if he's complaining, it means he's ungrateful and he suggested I think about those who have it worse than me when I'm feeling down. He further explained that 80% of the time, we're talking about problems and that he wants to talk about positive things more often such as our plans for the future. He said that when a person is with someone who they love, they want to feel happy in that moment because they are already struggling with their own stuff. By problems, what he was referring to were my health problems. The thing is, I only bring them up when he asks me how I'm doing. I'm also taking every measure possible to address my health problems, whether it's taking Tylenol, seeing a doctor, or caffeinating myself.

For context, I've been dealing with debilitating fatigue which I think is related to my iron deficiency. I'm a very solution oriented person and I've been described by my closest friends as pretty positive (which is why this took me by surprise). Before this past month, I was extremely healthy and fit, going to the gym five times a day and almost every day was a good day. He was there for that and back then, we were doing really well. Whenever I bring up something negative to him, I make sure it's essential (for example, if my health is going to influence my levels of affection or mood that day), I explain what I'm going to do to address it, and I try to offset the negativity by mentioning things I'm grateful for. For example, today I woke up feeling like I had the flu and it was worse than usual because I didn't sleep well. He asked me how I was doing and I said I was (just) okay, I didn't sleep well but I was going to take my ADHD meds and have some coffee to feel better. I only told him I didn't sleep well because I knew I was going to feel physically awful today and I didn't want him to take anything I might unintentionally say or do (or not do), personally. I don't randomly bring up how tired I am in conversations unprompted or anything like that.

He seems to be able to conceal his struggles and pain - he doesn't even tell me he has a headache unless it's been going on for days. But I'm an external processor. This means I'm the type of person who needs to talk through their feelings to feel better. To address my needs, I go to therapy and vent to my friends and my mom and I journal. Like I mentioned before, I generally only talk to my fiance about my problems when I know it's going to influence our interactions. The only exception was when I had a health scare and I had to call an ambulance (thank God, everything was fine). He asked how I was doing that night. I broke down and told him how hopeless I felt about my health and how I wasn't sure I was ever going to feel better. This was before I knew what was wrong with me medically. The next day, he said the relationship was becoming depressing and that he wasn't sure he could handle my health issues because he couldn't do anything to help. We've since talked things through and after my lab results came back with an answer, things drastically improved. He's since affirmed that he's going to be able to handle it and that he'll ask God for strength. So I thought we were doing well until yesterday.

I asked him what he thinks should change so that we're both happy. He said I'm not doing anything wrong but that he wishes we could talk about something other than my problems. This makes me worried for the future because I don't feel like I can be open with him about my struggles. I mentioned in our conversation today that I've already been holding back a lot from him - last week, I had a pretty nasty muscle spasm (at the time, I had no clue what was going on) that lasted over 12 hours. My back pain was so severe I almost went to the hospital, but I didn't tell him that at the time. I just mentioned the next day that I didn't sleep well because my back was hurting the night before and that I was going to see a doctor about it. Again, that was only after he asked me how I was doing. When I finally told him about the almost-went-to-the-hospital part, he didn't say anything or express any concern or sympathy. 

From my point of view, he appears to struggle to be emotionally present in moments of discomfort where there is no clear solution and he avoids conflict. He says things like ""Please don't cry or I'll cry, too"". When I brought up an article for him to skim so that he could support and understand me better as a neurodivergent person (following a misunderstanding between us), he said ""Okay, I'll look into it, now please be happy because I don't want to see you be hurt or upset"". He says he loves doing acts of service and he's convinced this will be a non issue when we live together. But I'm concerned about what would happen if I was sick with something chronic and/or extremely painful and bringing me a cup of tea or doing the dishes for me for a week or two isn't going to cut it. In those moments, I'd need emotional support.

I've had on and off illnesses for all my life. This has never been an issue before in any of my past friendships or relationships and as I've said before, the people around me generally describe me as a positive and uplifting presence no matter how I feel. I hate that expressing my feelings in an honest way is wearing him down this much and I want to meet him halfway. But I don't know how to do that without simply lying, saying I'm doing great, and then isolating myself until I feel well. Maybe there's a compromise that can be made to meet both of our needs. Or maybe we're incompatible.

TL;DR: My fianc√© says I complain too much about my health problems. I only bring it up when he asks how I'm doing, I always preface it with ""I'm okay"", I don't bring it up every time, I always find something positive to mention at least once a day, and I'm doing everything I can to address my health issues in a timely manner. I don't know what else I can do besides lie about how I really feel when he asks. I feel like I can't be myself around him and I'm worried about what a future with him will look like.

Oatly is being publicly targeted and litigated against by the dairy lobby, especially in Europe (Sweden, Spain and UK)and the U.S. In UK, the case will be heard soon at Supreme Court - they are not even allowed to use ‚Äúoat milk‚Äù based on previous rulings. In addition, significant lobbying on ‚Äúfake milk‚Äù , unjustified /non-scientific nutritional claims as well as advertising against the company and their stock permanently on going. Since their competitors (Danone,  Chobani , Planet oat is big dairy ; bad advertising is not against the category - but specifically the company).

On the other hand side, the company already opened up space for itself , and financially improving its situation: they will most probably be announcing their first profitable quarter next week , and their CEO appointed in 2023 always publicly say : ‚Äúprofitable growth is the only value creation path that will allow us to strengthen our impact to the world.‚Äù Despite they lost their biggest customer (Starbucks in NA) , their residual business is growing enough to compensate this year‚Ä¶ And profitability will drive further penetration and growth in 2026. (Already selling more than 600million liters globally, and foreseen to be growing)‚Ä¶

In last 3 weeks, they had several interviews (Handelblatt, Financial times) signaling the turnaround is complete and growth is back‚Ä¶ Their recent innovation-ready to drink Matcha got great attraction from the markets (started in UK and penetrating to other European markets).

Current market cap hovering around 400M USD. They executed an ADR ratio adjustment (soft reverse split) in February. Current ADRs are around 15USD (0,75 USD per ordinary share). They will announce their quarterly results on 29th October and most probably the first profitable quarter since IPO.

I put my money where my mouth is, and just grabbed 13500 ADR‚Äôs (270000 shares) of the company , in addition to ‚Äúbarista edition‚Äù and ‚Äúsuper basic‚Äù in the fridge.

Super basic : great for overnight oats, 40cal per serving .

Maren stumbled as they ran.
Maren her voice frantic

""Ohh my God We're so fucked!"" 
The last light at the end of the hall flickered out. Only the faint glimmer of the detective‚Äôs flashlight cut through the dark.

Then, from the ceiling a deep hiss shouts out. A clawed hand shot down, narrowly missing Maren‚Äôs head.

Harlan pulled her forward, the creature‚Äôs tail sweeping behind them, smashing into walls, bursting light fixtures one by one.
They reached the next intersection, gasping. Harlan turned, fired once more into the shadows, the muzzle flash illuminating a distorted, feral face leering down at them through the broken vent.

Harlan shouts out angrily. ‚ÄúCome on then, you son of a!-‚Äù

The ceiling gave way and the beast dropped. Harlan barely had time to dive aside as the thing crashed to the ground, shaking the entire room. The flashlight flew from his hand, spinning wildly before landing in a beam that caught the monster‚Äôs face.

Silv, or what was left of him, rose from the debris.
His frame was twisted, but powerful; skin stretched over muscle like pulled leather. His fingers were too long now, tipped with curved claws that flexed and clicked together as he moved. The tail dragged behind him, serrated ridges glinting faintly in the light.

Harlan fired Bang! Bang! Bang!
The bullets hit, but Silv barely flinched. The wounds closed, flesh tightening and reforming with a wet sound.

Maren screamed, backing into the corner as the detective tried to reload.

Silv tilted his head, studying him. The voice that came from him wasn‚Äôt human ‚Äî it rasped and cracked, like something speaking through broken glass.

Silv: ‚ÄúHungry..‚Äù

Harlan aimed again. ‚ÄúYeah? Come get fed.‚Äù

The creature lunged. Harlan rolled aside as claws tore through the wall where his head had been. The impact sent concrete dust exploding into the air. The detective swung the butt of his gun, cracking it across the creature‚Äôs jaw, it barely staggered him.

Silv snarled, the sound deep and layered. He grabbed Harlan by the chest and hurled him across the room. The detective hit the filing cabinet hard, metal caving beneath his weight. His breath left him in a gasp.

Maren screams out. ""Harlan!""

Silv turned toward her. His nostrils flared, scenting her perfume. His breathing slowed, confusion flickering across that monstrous face.He took a step closer, head cocking.
The faintest whisper left him.

‚Äú...Mother?‚Äù

Harlan, bleeding but conscious, used the moment. He pulled his knife from his belt and drove it deep into Silv‚Äôs side.

The creature roared, and backhanded him across the room. Harlan hit the wall and slid down, dazed, blood trailing from his mouth.

Maren shouted, trembling. ‚ÄúSilv! Stop! Please!‚Äù

The creature froze, twitching, torn between rage and that faint thread of recognition. Its breathing grew ragged.

Harlan, groaning, forced himself up, gun in hand. ‚ÄúYou want to live, Maren? Then move!‚Äù

He fired again, point-blank this time, straight into Silv‚Äôs face. The creature reeled back, howling, blood spraying in a dark mist.

The detective grabbed Maren‚Äôs arm, dragging her toward the hallway as the monster slammed its claws into the floor, roaring in fury. Behind them, Silv began to change again. His spine arched, bones cracking audibly as something larger pushed beneath his skin. His tail whipped across the walls, sparks flying from broken wires.The lights above them flickered red, backup power groaning to life.

Maren screams out. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs chasing us again!‚Äù

Harlan turned back once, eyes wide, as Silv began to crawl after them on all fours, faster than before. His face had contorted back for the most part. 

They ran.The echo of claws against concrete followed close behind.

They tore down the corridor, Maren half-dragging Harlan as the sound of claws scraped the floor behind them. The flickering red lights turned the walls into a strobing nightmare.

A sign ahead flickered:
SUBLEVEL ACCESS ‚Äì AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

The door beneath it was rusted and warped, a heavy security latch half-broken from years of decay. Harlan slammed his shoulder into it.
Bang!
Bang!
The third hit broke it open, and they stumbled through into a narrow stairwell that spiraled into darkness.

Maren is panting now. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not stopping..‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we keep moving!‚Äù

Above them, something struck the wall  hard. Plaster rained down as the vent along the stairwell ceiling buckled inward. The creature was in the ducts again, crawling parallel to them, tracking every step.
They descended fast, their footsteps echoing like gunfire. The lower they went, the thicker the air became.
At the bottom of the stairs, they found a reinforced door marked GENERATOR CONTROL. Harlan tried the handle. Locked.

He raised his gun, and shot the latch. The echo roared through the stairwell.
The door swung open to reveal a cavernous basement humming faintly with failing machinery. Rusted generators lined the walls, cables snaking across the floor. The red emergency lights barely reached the far end of the room.

Harlan shut the door behind them, dragging a heavy pipe across the handle to wedge it closed. Maren collapsed against the wall, trembling.

‚ÄúOhh my God, we are gonna fucking die here! This is it!"" 

Harlan grabs her shoulders ""No we will get out of this! Think really hard, what could we use against him?""

"" I think if I..""
From the other side of the door came a low thump. Then another.

The metal creaked.

Harlan stepped back, his gun raised as Maren rushed over to the generator.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gonna break through.‚Äù

Maren responds. ‚ÄúLet him..‚Äù

The detective frowned. Then his eyes darted upward.
The vents. A faint hiss, air shifting.
The grate above them twisted, and a long, clawed arm slid through the opening.

Harlan fired. The vent exploded in sparks.
But another grate gave way behind them. Then another. The sound multiplied, claws scraping, tail dragging, a wet slithering closing in from all sides.

Harlan looks at all entry points in a panic. ""Maren.. whatever you got planning.. could you maybe speed it up!""

The lights dimmed further as one of the generators sparked out. For a moment, total darkness. Then, in a faint beam from his  flashlight, 
Silv dropped from the ceiling, landing in front of the exit.
His movements were fluid now, animalistic.

Silv straightened slowly, tilting his head, breathing deep as if tasting their fear. The sound of the generators pulsed behind him like a heartbeat.

He took a step forward.
Then another.

Harlan fired again. click.
Empty. The creature smiled and lunged.
Harlan barely managed to shove Maren out of the way as the creature‚Äôs claws shredded through a steel table, sending sparks into the air. The impact rang through the generator room.

He raised a broken pipe, swinging wildly. The strike landed across Silv‚Äôs shoulder making him turn, the creature's lips peeled back into a snarl that exposed a jaw full of serrated, uneven teeth. Maren scrambled to her knees, eyes darting across the generator panels, her fingers trembled as she followed the cables to a half-scorched control box.

The hum of the machines around them was weak, dying but had just enough energy for a final push.

Maren shouts. ‚ÄúIf I can reroute the current, the backup floodlights might still work!""

She tore open the control box with a wrench, sparks flying. Wires hissed and crackled. Her hands moved fast, crossing cables, ignoring the pain as heat seared her fingers.

Silv snapped his teeth into the metal pipe, pushing Harlan further into the ground. ‚ÄúWhatever you‚Äôre doing, do it now!‚Äù

Silv let out a roar, releasing the pipe before holding himself up to rip apart the detective,  claws outstretched.

Maren slammed the switch. The room exploded in white light. Every overhead lamp burst to life at once, flooding the sublevel with searing brightness. The sudden glare reflected off the steel walls, pure and merciless.

Silv screamed.
It wasn‚Äôt human. It was rage and agony fused into one shriek. He stumbled backward, thrashing. His tail smashed into a generator, sparks flying.

For the first time, Harlan saw him clearly ‚Äî the jagged stitching of the grey worn out suit he wore, the unnatural blending of muscle and sinew, his foggy eyes shot in pain as he covered his eyes shut.

Harlan shouts in surprise. ‚ÄúThe lights! He can‚Äôt handle direct exposure!‚Äù

Silv let out one last guttural hiss before he retreated, scrambling back up the wall like a reptile, tail whipping as he climbed. He slipped into the vent shaft, disappearing into the dark with a metallic screech.

The room fell silent except for the whir of the generators. Maren collapsed beside the console, breathing hard, her burned fingers trembling. Harlan dropped his weapon, staring up at the torn vent.

‚ÄúYou saved us.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ just bought us time.‚Äù

Harlan then turned to Maren.
She sat slumped against the wall, clutching her burned hand, her eyes avoiding his.

‚ÄúYou gonna tell me what the hell that was back there?‚Äù

‚ÄúI turned the lights on.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt play dumb with me.‚Äù He took a step closer. ‚ÄúYou knew what would happen. You knew the lights would scare him.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúYou also knew he‚Äôd hesitate around you. He‚Äôs torn this place apart, but he didn‚Äôt lay a finger on you.‚Äù

Her shoulders tensed. The faint hum of the generators filled the silence between them.

His voice grows low with suspicion. ‚ÄúWhy? Why does he stop when he sees you?‚Äù

Maren‚Äôs eyes flicked to the vent, the last place Silv‚Äôs pale eyes had glared down at her. Her voice came out as a whisper.

‚ÄúBecause I make him remember.‚Äù

He frowned. ‚ÄúRemember what?‚Äù

She slowly reached into her satchel and pulled out something small, a folded, worn piece of cloth. The faded pattern was barely visible, but even in the dim light, it was unmistakably a child‚Äôs blanket.

‚ÄúThis was his mother‚Äôs..‚Äù

Harlan's jaw tightened. ‚ÄúWhere did you get that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found it years ago‚Ä¶ when I was assigned here as a nurse. His father kept it, hidden in his office. When Silv first transformed, it was the only thing that calmed him. I thought if he ever came back‚Ä¶‚Äù
Her voice broke off. She looked down, pressing the blanket to her chest.
‚ÄúI thought maybe it could keep me alive.‚Äù

Harlan‚Äôs eyes narrowed, circling her words like a predator himself.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying you planned this?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!.‚Äù Her voice rose, trembling. ‚ÄúI was trying to help him. But once his father started the experiments, there was no stopping it. He said he could heal people, that Silv was a miracle..!‚Äù

Harlan interrupted. ‚ÄúThen why wear her perfume, Maren? The same scent the mother used?‚Äù

She froze, staring at him.
‚ÄúBecause he hunts by smell.‚Äù
Maren spoke quietly, almost ashamed.

‚ÄúIf I smell like her‚Ä¶ he won‚Äôt attack me. He doesn‚Äôt see me. He sees her.‚Äù

The detective exhaled slowly, disgust and pity crossing his face.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre using his grief as a shield.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not just a monster. There‚Äôs still something of him left. Somewhere in that thing, the boy who lost his mother is still crying for her.‚Äù

Harlan‚Äôs expression hardened. ‚ÄúAnd what happens when he stops remembering?‚Äù

The question hung in the air. Neither spoke.

A distant sound cuts through the silence, a clang, far above, in the vents.

The detective raised his gun again, eyes scanning the ceiling.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre out of time.‚Äù He looked at Maren, his tone low and cold now.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to show me everything you know about him, the files, the tests, the father‚Äôs research. No more secrets.‚Äù

Maren clutched the blanket tighter, her expression hollow.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in the observation wing‚Ä¶ but if we go there, he‚Äôll follow us.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He chambers a round.
‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll end this where it began.‚Äù

The emergency lights flickered in a rhythm like a heartbeat as Harlan and Maren made their way through the lower hall. The generator‚Äôs hum faded behind them, replaced by the faint creak of the asylum‚Äôs metal doors, pipes groaning, vents hissing. Every sound felt alive.

Maren walked ahead, her burned hand pressed to the blanket tucked against her chest. Harlan kept his flashlight trained down the corridor, weapon in the other hand.

‚ÄúHow far is this observation wing?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust past the surgical floor. The offices should still be sealed.‚Äù

The hallway split in two. The sign above them was rusted, but still legible: Observation / Genetic Archive.

They moved toward the archive door, thick glass streaked with years of grime. The detective pushed it open with the barrel of his gun.

Inside, the air was cold and stale. Rows of metal filing cabinets stood like gravestones, their drawers warped and bent. The walls were lined with cracked screens and shelves full of tapes, labeled in the same red ink: PROJECT NIGHTCRAWLER ‚Äì PHASE 1‚Äì12.

Harlan set the flashlight down and began digging through the drawers. Old reports, photos, X-rays, each one more grotesque than the last. Notes in the doctor‚Äôs scrawled handwriting covered the margins: ‚ÄúMetabolic collapse. Subject unresponsive.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúAdd canine sensory genome.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúMother‚Äôs interference continues to impede progress.‚Äù

He paused.
That last line was underlined twice.

He flipped the page. There was a transcript,  a phone log.
At the top, written in neat handwriting: ‚ÄúDr. R. Halvorsen / M. Vale ‚Äì private.‚Äù

He scanned the text, his brow furrowing.

Maren spoke softly. ‚ÄúWhat did you find?‚Äù

Harlan started reading the file. ‚ÄúYour name.‚Äù

She froze. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He turned the page around.
The words were plain as day:

‚ÄúM. Vale will ensure removal of the subject‚Äôs mother during transport. Custody transfer must appear natural. The patient will adapt better without maternal interference.‚Äù

Maren‚Äôs lips parted, but no words came out.

Harlan stepped closer, his voice low and dangerous. ‚ÄúYou worked with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou helped him kill her. You were the nurse on duty the night his mother died.‚Äù

Maren shook her head violently, tears forming. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen like that! He said it would be clean, that she‚Äôd just go to sleep. He told me it was mercy, that she was sick and!..‚Äù

Harlan slammed his hand against the filing cabinet, making her flinch.

‚ÄúYou murdered his mother so that monster could have a test subject!‚Äù

She backed away, trembling.
‚ÄúI thought!. I thought if I stayed close, I could protect the boy‚Ä¶ that I could stop him before it got too far‚Ä¶‚Äù

Korrin‚Äôs eyes burned with disgust.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt protect someone by destroying their life!.‚Äù

For a long moment, neither spoke. The hum of the asylum filled the silence again, the low, electric vibration that never stopped.

Then the lights flickered.
Once. Twice.
A vent above them rattled. The dust sifted down like ash. The overhead light burst, plunging them into partial darkness.

From the far end of the archive room came a slow, deliberate sound, claws dragging against metal.

Both the nurse and detective pressed forward through the maze of steel doors, the scent of mold and ash clinging to the air. Behind them, the sound of claws scraping against ductwork drew closer.

Maren whispers. ‚ÄúWe need to keep moving,  he‚Äôll smell us if we stay here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seem to know exactly what he‚Äôll do, and don't say we. He doesn't smell YOU, he smells me.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer. Her eyes darted toward the emergency stairwell, then back at the vent grating overhead that trembled slightly.

Harlan‚Äôs grip tightened on his weapon.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not telling me something.‚Äù

Maren snaps at him. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand! I‚Äôve been trying to keep him calm, to keep you safe!‚Äù

He cut her off. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been lying since we got here!‚Äù

They reached a cell door. Maren shoved it open, but instead of going through, she stopped and turned. Her hand slipped behind her back, fingers curling around a tranquilizer syringe hidden under her coat.

Harlan realizes. ‚ÄúWhat are you!-‚Äù

The needle sank into his neck before he could finish. He stumbled backward, the world swaying and blurring. The flashlight clattered to the floor, rolling in a dizzy circle of light.

Maren spoke out almost tearful. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Detective. But he only hunts the ones who don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù

She shoved him through the doorway, into the padded isolation room. The same metal door she‚Äôd shown him earlier. It slammed shut behind him with a hollow clang.
He pounded on it, voice slurred from the sedative.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out of your damn mind, Maren!‚Äù

Through the reinforced window, he could see her, breathing fast, her face pale and trembling.

‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt hurt me. He remembers my scent. His mother‚Äôs scent.‚Äù
Then the vents above him groaned. The air shifted.

Harlan‚Äôs eyes widened as something massive crawled down from the shadows, his pale skin glistening, breath rattling like a growl trapped in its throat.

The monster dropped into the room, crouched low, the tattered remains of what was once his father's grey suit from the photos clung loosely to him. 
Maren stood outside the window, clutching the blanket to her chest, watching with a trembling smile.

But then Harlan moved.
With a surge of adrenaline, he snatched the blanket from her through the narrow gap when she opened the hatch to gloat.

Maren screams out, reaching for the blanket. ‚ÄúNo! Give that back!‚Äù

He stumbled backward, clutching it like a lifeline. Then he dragged the filthy blanket through, throwing grime and ash onto Maren until the perfume‚Äôs soft floral trace was replaced by decay. He finally gave-way to the tranquilizer and collapsed against the wall, sliding back down. 

The creature froze mid-step. Its nostrils flared.
The scent was now solely on Harlan. 
Slowly, its gaze turned toward the window where Maren stood, now unshielded.

Her face fell. ‚ÄúSilv‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs..it‚Äôs Maren. I!-‚Äù

The creature‚Äôs head tilted, the muscles in its jaw twitching as if trying to remember the name. Then it screeched, a sound like metal splitting in half, and launched at the glass.

‚ÄúNo‚Äî NO!‚Äù

The reinforced window shattered.
Harlan ducked away weakly as the creature dragged her through the hallway thrashing, her screams echoing down the corridor before they were abruptly cut off.

Blood spattered across the blanket in his hands.

Silence followed.
‚ÄúGuess you finally found your justice,‚Äù he muttered under his breath.

The creature lingered for a moment in the doorway, watching him.
Not attacking. Not moving.
Then it vanished back into the dark, right as the detective blacked out. 

The reinforced vans idled in the overgrown driveway, emergency lights flashing across the broken windows.
Harlan sat in the ambulance truck beside his supervisor Raines, both watching as teams in hazmat suits combed through the ruins of Blackridge Asylum.

Raines speaks out. ‚ÄúNothing. No bodies, no signs of the nurse, no tracks. Just claw marks‚Ä¶ and blood.‚Äù

Harlan's jaw tightened.
He didn‚Äôt answer. His eyes lingered on the shattered open gates. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky to be alive, Detective. Whatever happened down there, it‚Äôs done. You hear me?‚Äù

Harlan nodded slightly, though his gaze didn‚Äôt waver.

‚ÄúYeah. Done.‚Äù

But as the words left his mouth, a cold breeze slipped through the asylum‚Äôs entrance, whispering against the walls like a breath, making Harlan shiver. 

 ‚Ä¢Harlan's Apartment (Weeks Later)

The city‚Äôs hum outside was almost too normal.
On his coffee table sat a sealed evidence box marked PROJECT NIGHTCRAWLER ‚Äî returned to him after debriefing. He hadn‚Äôt opened it.

His supervisor‚Äôs voice still echoed in his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre off duty for a month. Take it. You need it.‚Äù

The apartment lights flickered once, then steadied.
Harlan sat back on his couch, staring at the reflection of the TV screen black and blank.

We created this community to be your trusted guide in the often-confusing world of cryptocurrency. This post is your starting point ‚Äì a simple, no-nonsense guide to what crypto is and how you can make your very first investment safely.



**What is Cryptocurrency, in Simple Terms?**



Think of cryptocurrency as digital money that exists only on the internet. It‚Äôs secured by a technology called a blockchain, which is like a public, super-secure digital receipt book that can't be changed or faked.



The most important feature? Unlike traditional money, it‚Äôs not controlled by any single bank or government. This is what makes it both exciting and different.



Why Should You Even Bother?



People invest in crypto for a few key reasons:

High Growth Potential: Some cryptocurrencies have seen tremendous growth in value, offering returns not typically seen in traditional markets.

It's the Future of Finance: Many believe blockchain technology will revolutionize industries, and they want to be part of it early on.

Diversification: It's a way to spread your investments beyond just stocks and bonds.



**Your 5-Step Safe Start Plan**



Ready to begin? Follow these five steps to ensure your first experience is a safe one.



**Step 1: Choose Your ""Campus"" ‚Äì A Reputable Exchange**

An exchange is a marketplace where you can buy and sell crypto. For beginners, it's crucial to start with a large, trusted platform.

Top Choices: Coinbase, Binance, Kraken etc.

Action: Create an account on one of these exchanges and complete the security verification (this usually involves uploading an ID).



Step 2: Pick Your ""Majors"" ‚Äì The Best Coins for Beginners

With thousands of coins, it's easy to get overwhelmed. For your first investment, stick to the ""blue-chip"" cryptocurrencies:

**Bitcoin (BTC):** The original and most well-known crypto. It's like the ""gold standard"" of the digital world.

**Ethereum (ETH)**: More than just a currency, it's a platform for building applications. Think of it as the ""internet of the future.""

Action: Decide to start with either BTC or ETH. Don't worry about other, smaller coins for now.



Step 3: Get Your ""Wallet"" ‚Äì Securing Your Assets

When you buy crypto on an exchange, it's like keeping money at a bank. For more security, especially with larger amounts, you need a personal wallet.

Hot Wallets (Software): Apps on your phone or computer (e.g., Trust Wallet, MetaMask). Good for small amounts.

Cold Wallets (Hardware): Physical devices (e.g., Ledger, Trezor). The most secure option for long-term storage.

*Action: For now, you can leave your first small purchase on the exchange. But start learning about wallets for the future.*



Step 4: Your ""Coffee Money"" Investment

This is the most important rule: invest only an amount you are absolutely willing to lose. Your first goal is not to get rich, but to learn the process.

Action: Buy just $10 or $20 worth of BTC or ETH. Experience the process of funding your account, making a purchase, and seeing the crypto in your account.



Step 5: Define Your ""Game Plan"" ‚Äì HODL or Trade?

Decide on a simple strategy.

HODL (Hold On for Dear Life): The simplest strategy. You buy and hold for the long term (months or years), believing the value will increase.

Trading: More active buying and selling to profit from short-term price changes. This is more advanced and higher risk.

Action: As a beginner, the safest and recommended strategy is to HODL your first small investment.

1octfqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1octfqi/how_to_make_friends_as_an_adult/,How to make friends as an adult ?,"so for some context i (f20) have been in the same job part time since i was 17 , so everyone there i have either known for three years or have known the whole time they have worked there . everyone at my work except 2 people are close with one another (meet for coffee in store on their days off , or just generally make plans with one another and talk outside of work) . i get along with everyone and ive never picked a fight with any of them , but despite getting to know them more personally at work no one seems to want to be friends with me outside of work . 

me and another co worker talked about this a few days ago , how it feels quite isolating to watch most of our team be so close and we‚Äôre just ‚Äòwork friends‚Äô to them , and we both know that a friendship would be a bit weird between us as he‚Äôs much older than me and we don‚Äôt share many same interests , as much as we get along at work and are happy to give eachother advice on things from our personal lives we never talk outside of work . 

everyone i work with is at least 4 years or more older than i am , most of them closer to ten years older . 

i only have one close friend that i speak to regularly (and even then that‚Äôs not even once a week most of the time) , and two other friends that are actually my cousins but are similar in age and we‚Äôve become friends from that . 

i just don‚Äôt know how to make proper friendships anymore , im also a parent to a toddler so most of my time is with my toddler , partner or work . but aside from that my life is pretty bland . i go out and meet up with my cousins occasionally (individually as they don‚Äôt know eachother and would find it awkward) , and sometimes my best friend , but apart from that i have no one to speak to most of the time . my sister and brother both have their own lives and friends and while i do semi regularly speak to my sister it‚Äôs not the same as having friends outside of the family . 

when me and my partner started talking and getting closer to dating he had a big group of friends and they would all meet up regularly (but it became a monthly thing towards the time of us dating as they all had jobs and some had kids etc) , bit since we got together those friendships have dwindled a fair amount (one was his ex that he didn‚Äôt want to be friends with anyone , one was his friends bf who became her ex who then tried to sleep with my bfs ex so their friendship ended , one is someone i get along with but she really likes stirring things and has strange boundaries so tbh the fact that that‚Äôs one of the main lasting friendships often rubs me the wrong way , and the others have just kind of gotten on with their own lives and aren‚Äôt around as much) . as much as i know this is sadly a part of growing up i feel almost like my own isolated life has been a factor in my partners friend group becoming a much smaller part of his life . and part of me worries that not having a big friend group anymore has dulled his life down so he‚Äôs not as happy as he was before . he tells me all the time that he‚Äôs happy and how much he loves our family , but looking at our messages when he did socialise a lot more compared to our lives now he doesn‚Äôt seem as outwardly excitable , but i know this also could just be us being settled now . 

anyway , essentially i regularly feel lonely and isolated from my own lack of friends , and i don‚Äôt really have time or motivation to take up a hobby (i also have ADHD so struggle with sticking with hobbies) so im not really sure how else to make friends as an adult , work doesn‚Äôt seem to be an option as it hasn‚Äôt worked in 3 years so i doubt it will work now , and i don‚Äôt really want to just end up with ‚Äòmum‚Äô friends because most of my time already is just about parenting and going all day most weekdays parenting alone and then spending my social time talking about parenting might actually make me go mad . 

i used to have a friend group but most of them drifted when i became a parent and when the father of my child passed , and any others have all drifted from going to uni or getting in relationships etc . 

how can i make friends and meaningful connections again ?

1octd9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1octd9f/blissful_weekend/,Blissful Weekend,"I‚Äôm basking in the afterglow of an amazing weekend.  A bunch of my friends rented cabins out of town for my birthday, and I split a two bedroom cabin with my wife, and my girlfriend and her nesting partner. 

At one point I was cuddling with my wife and was like isn‚Äôt non-monogamy great when everyone involved is not an asshole and we talked about how excellent the trip was going.

I had cuddles with both my partners, hot showers with both of them, kisses in the hot tub with both of them. They took turns being the designated driver on different days for our outings. At one point I was laying in bed listening to them in the kitchen - one making me coffee and the other breakfast. At another point my girlfriend and I were cuddling and listening to our nesting partners talking and laughing in the living room. We hung out all together, and I got one on one cute time with both of them at the beach or cabin. I had some mind blowing sex with each of them individually at points throughout the weekend, and the evening we all partied hard for my birthday we had impromptu group sex with my wife, gf, and a friend. 

I‚Äôm disabled and can‚Äôt do a lot of standing or bending over so things like standing in a kitchen or picking stuff up is challenging and the two of them just took care of me all weekend, bringing me things where I was sitting, making sure my wheelchair was good to go, packing and cleaning, etc.

My girlfriend‚Äôs partner is also disabled and I absolutely loved watching her care take her, showing so much love and consideration towards her needs. The two of them together are very mischievous and silly and they were doing improvised comedy skits in the back of the car till I was unable to breathe while laughing in the front seat. 

My gf told my wife she loves her because she loves me and my wife is such a big part of my life and taking care of me and making sure my needs are met that she has to love her because of how she shows up for me. 

I got kisses and butt pats and hugs all weekend and at a few points had my eyes closed and was kissed and wasn‚Äôt sure who was doing it because they had both been all over me all weekend üòÇ

I just felt so incredibly treasured and spoiled and just over brimming with love and am utterly basking in the afterglow of it all - and that‚Äôs just the poly feelings. The rest of the weekend was beyond amazing and my friends pulled out all the stops to make my birthday an event to remember. And through this I was also texting with my other girlfriend who couldn‚Äôt make it out this weekend but who was keeping me updated on their going ons and telling me how glad they were I was having a good time. 

Now I‚Äôm looking forward to cute dates with my girlfriend who couldn‚Äôt make it out, planning a one on one vacation with my girlfriend so we can get busy all weekend without worrying about entertaining friends, and trying to figure out a vacation that me and my wife and girlfriend and her girlfriend could all go on just the four of us sans friends and party.

However, that means my milk cannot go more than that, as putting 150ml will make the coffee disappear a bit.

So, is there anything I can do other than just lower the dose? (although, it's nice that I can save up for more beans). Perhaps changing the beans? And any of you ever encountered something similar?

1oct5ux,https://i.redd.it/o9yiaj2rzjwf1.png,The decluttering habit that makes you fall in love with your home again,"Everyone talks about *what* to declutter: clothes, cables, old mail, the junk drawer.  
But hardly anyone talks about *why* clutter keeps coming back even after a deep clean.

We‚Äôve seen this pattern across hundreds of homes during property maintenance jobs: clutter isn‚Äôt about laziness or messiness, it‚Äôs about **decision fatigue**. Every item you touch asks for a decision: *Where do I belong? Do I still matter?* When you delay that decision with the phrase, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put this here for now,‚Äù you‚Äôve just planted the seed of future clutter.

That one small habit quietly undermines every clean-up effort.

Here‚Äôs what actually works long-term:

# 1. Replace ‚Äúfor now‚Äù with ‚Äúfor purpose.‚Äù

When you‚Äôre holding something (a tool, a bill, a coffee cup), ask yourself, *what‚Äôs its next use?*  
If the answer isn‚Äôt clear, that‚Äôs your cue it doesn‚Äôt belong in the space. It either needs:

* A **designated home** (a hook, a drawer, a container), or
* To leave your home altogether.

One reason we see ‚Äúpermanent piles‚Äù in hallways or garages is that people confuse *temporary storage* with *transit zones*. These are different things. A proper transit zone (like a labeled basket near the door) gives your items a clear purpose on their way out (donations, repairs, returns). It stops clutter before it starts.

# 2. The ‚ÄúLimbo Basket‚Äù Rule (that actually works)

We picked up this trick while managing residential cleaning for properties in between tenancies. We noticed homes that had a single ‚Äúundecided‚Äù basket stayed consistently tidier than those that didn‚Äôt.

The rule is simple:  
If you touch something and can‚Äôt decide, toss it in the limbo basket.  
If you haven‚Äôt needed it in two weeks, it‚Äôs not important.

The secret is location. Keep it *visible* but not central ‚Äî near a laundry or garage door works best. When people hide their limbo basket in a cupboard, it just becomes long-term storage. When it‚Äôs visible, it stays active.

# 3. Don‚Äôt declutter room by room, declutter by category of function.

We‚Äôve noticed that people who declutter by room often just relocate the mess. Instead, try decluttering by what an item *does*: paperwork, tools, cables, cleaning gear, etc.

This mimics how professional cleaners and property maintenance teams organize their supplies. Everything is grouped by task, not by where it happens. It‚Äôs the most efficient way to avoid duplication (like five half-empty bottles of window spray in different rooms).

# 4. Micro-zoning: the pro secret to a lasting tidy home

In every home we maintain, the tidiest ones aren‚Äôt those with the most storage, they‚Äôre the ones with clear micro-zones. For example:

* One hook *only* for keys and lanyards.
* One shelf *only* for mail and stationery.
* One small tray *only* for screws, batteries, or loose hardware.

These tiny, clearly defined spaces train your habits subconsciously. When your brain knows exactly where something belongs, clutter rarely even starts.

# 5. Maintenance mindset beats minimalist mindset.

People get caught up in the ‚Äúdeclutter once and be done‚Äù mindset. But homes, especially in Auckland‚Äôs humid climate, need **maintenance habits**.

We‚Äôve learned that tidy homes are a side effect of consistent, light upkeep, same way a property stays in shape with small, regular care rather than big, occasional repairs.  
Ten minutes every evening to reset the surfaces does more for a home‚Äôs energy (and your stress) than a full-day cleanup every few months.

The truth is, clutter doesn‚Äôt return because we own too much, it returns because our systems can‚Äôt keep up with real life.  
Once you stop putting things down ‚Äúfor now,‚Äù you start designing a home that works with you, not against you.

And if you ever want proof that prevention works better than correction, ask anyone who‚Äôs ever tried to clean a garage that got ‚Äúa little cluttered‚Äù over winter.",1,1761091020.0,u_WilliamsPropertyNZ,0,1.0,False

1oct11x,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1oct11x/some_things_i_have_learned_from_15_years_of/,Some things I have learned from 15 years of coaching (updated),"Hello All,

This is going to be a long-ass-post. Long enough that it doesn't all fit in the post and the last bit is in the comments. If you don't enjoy reading long-ass-posts, I would go ahead and skip this one.

Anyway...

About nine months ago I made a post titled \*Some Things I Have Learned from 15-Years of Coaching.\* I had intended to write a follow up to that post with some more things I have learned, but this didn't happen for a few reasons.

The first reason is that I started a second business in the education space with the intention that I would build this business as a sort of throw away thing in order to work on improving my product creation skills and so that I could test and refine my marketing methods in order to create a meaningful framework that I could replicate over and over again within my fitness business.¬†

My goal for a while now has been to move away from service based business model and to move towards a product based business model. Mostly because I wan't more free time to pursue other things and because the only real bottleneck I have in my coaching business is the limited amount of time that I have available. Also, I'm damn tired. I've been doing this coaching thing for almost 16-years now. I could really use a break.

So far this second business has been more successful than I had originally imagined and has therefore taken up more of my time. Two education products have generated about $80k in revenue in about 13-months. Not nearly enough to replace my coaching income, but certainly a nice supplement to it. So far, I have spent about 350 hours on the two products which puts my hourly revenue at about $230, but that number should continue to increase over time. I will probably do a highly detailed post about that business in the future, but I will probably wait until I have released a few more products, have more data, and have something to say that I feel is important to say and that other people can apply to their own businesses.¬†

The second reason I haven't been posting as much is because of how popular AI chat-bot written posts and responses have become on Reddit and all over the rest of the internet. I really enjoy talking with humans, not chat-bots, and seeing how prevalent AI has become on the platform has been discouraging. Seeing that the way that AI writes has begun to influence and change the way that real people write has been extra discouraging and even disturbing.

I like talking to humans, even the messy and far from perfect ones. I don't have any interest in talking with the polished and homogenized shadows of humans that get created when we filter everything we say, do, and think through AI.

I realize that probably sounds very ""old man shouts at clouds"" to you, and you would be right because it is, but that's genuinely how I feel. Consequently, I haven't had much to say.

Anyway...¬†

I will probably still write a follow up to that post but for now this is just an updated and improved version of that original post I wrote about 9 months ago. I have tried to improve some things to make them more clear, I have adjusted some things to match with the current frameworks I have built out, and I have expanded some sections to make them more applicable to the whoever chooses to read them. I have also added a few more ""bonus"" line items at the end of the article. This looks like it has almost tripled the size of the original post. You have been warned.

Also, I didn't really go through and edit or polish it, so there are probably plenty of typos and some pretty basic grammar mistakes that I have made. Oh, well. That is how humans write on the internet.

As always, hope it helps and feel free to drop any questions you have in the comments or through a DM and I'll do my best to get back to you with some kind of meaningful response.

Recently, I seem to be getting more and more DMs and Emails with trainers and coaches who are looking for advice. They always have the same set of questions, primarily: ‚ÄúHow do I get more clients.‚Äù This is most likely because we are currently in the busy season for most gym/coaches, but it seems that all these people have the same key issues once we dig into it a bit more. What I have done here is collect what I tell these people based on what I have learned during my 15 years of experience as a coach who makes a very comfortable income in the industry. An email exchange takes far more time on my end and can only really help one person. Hopefully this can help more.

Also, it‚Äôs probably important to let people know before they dig into reading this that I don‚Äôt view coaching as some shallow practice or side hustle. I am highly serious about the practice of coaching and everything involved with it. This means that the advice I have to give, or at least the most important advice, probably won‚Äôt be very useful to those who view coaching as something far more casual or as a simple job. Because of this I get very technical and nuanced about its practice. This will probably make me, and the things I write, fairly insufferable to plenty of people. Also, this post started out fairly casual and became much more technical as I continued around line item 3 or so. I could go back and rewrite or edit it down, but I think that would be a disservice to some people. So, I‚Äôm just going to leave it the way it is.

Anyway, hope it helps.

# 1. You must have a solid identity as a coach.

This is foundational to everything that comes next. You will hear plenty of coaches go on and on about making sure you have a niche in the industry to the point that it has pretty much just become an empty talking point that is then followed up by zero information on what a niche truly is and how to find one for yourself.

A niche is simply a well-fleshed-out category of potential clientele. Great, but how does that really help you? Which niche do you choose? How do you flesh out a category of clientele once you do?

This really all comes down to your identity as a coach because we don‚Äôt find niches, we create them based on who we are. They are generally just reflections of who we are as a person.

Who are you?¬†

Are you a 50-year-old male bodybuilder who focuses on old school training and nutrition?¬†

Are you a 25-year-old woman who focuses on primal nutrition and combining yoga and meditation with resistance training?¬†

Are you a 30-year-old guy who focuses on looks-maxing and optimizing for a party lifestyle?¬†

Are you a 35-year-old woman who focuses on pre, peri, and postpartum training and nutrition for new moms with careers?

Are you a 40-year old Dungeons and Dragons aficionado that focuses on gamification of the fitness process?

These are all low level identities for these imagined case studies. Think of identity like your personal brand but it runs deeper than that. Whatever problems and interests you have are the problems and interests that your potential customer base will most likely have.

The worst thing you can say at this point is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a coach who focuses on fat loss and muscle gain.‚Äù Imagine if someone referred you to a mechanic and when you asked what made that mechanic special they said, ‚ÄúHe focuses on fixing cars.‚Äù I sure as hell hope he fucking does. Can you imagine a mechanic who didn‚Äôt focus on fixing cars? How successful do you think that mechanic would be? Can you imagine meeting a coach who doesn‚Äôt focus on fat loss and muscle gain? ¬†How successful do you think that coach would be?

Think of you identity like a description for a movie. Can you imagine if someone tried to get you to go see a movie and when you asked them what it's about they said, ""It's a movie"", and then acted like that was supposed to mean something to you.¬†

The thins is, everyone that I described above focuses on fat loss and muscle gain. They just focus on that for a very specific clientele and approach it in a specific way. Simply focusing on the same thing that everyone else focuses on without any kind of specificity makes you a commodity level coach and means that any other coach who has just the smallest amount of specificity will always be a more attractive and better choice for a potential client. It also makes marketing yourself one of the most difficult things you can possibly do because marketing as a coach is almost always persuading the potential client about why they should choose you and not someone else. When you are almost identical to a couple of thousand other people out there, and therefore interchangeable, this will often come down to who is perceived as more likable and even then, those most likeable people are going to have a very hard or even impossible time competing with those who have a true identity in the industry even if they are less likeable.

Being a commodity level coach is a loser‚Äôs game. You really need to have a well-fleshed-out identity, a description of an ideal client, a mission statement, and code of conduct. This is really the bare minimum for knowing who you are as a coach.¬†

Your identity comes first. Try and write out as much as you can about yourself. Just really dump it all out on the page. Then answer some questions about yourself. Why did you get into fitness in the first place? Is that why you are still currently involved with fitness? If not, what changed? What domain of fitness do you exist within? What sub-domains do you exist within? What problems did you initially have? How did you solve those problems? What problems couldn't you solve? The more questions you can ask yourself, the better.¬†

Unfortunately, there isn't an easy 5-step process, or some kind of script you can follow to figure out your identity. Simply fill in all the blanks and you're good to go. It turns out that self reflection and discovery isn't something you can bust out in an afternoon. The truth is that you are going to struggle with this for a while. And until you figure it out, nothing else I have to say in this article really matters.

The best way to go about it is likely to share what you wan't to achieve with another person and then have a long conversation with them. They really need to understand what you are actually trying to do. The right person will be able to ask you all kinds of questions that you wouldn't be able to think of by yourself. The right person will also be able to view you as a whole without the kind of blinders we naturally have when we try to view ourselves from an outside perspective.¬†

After that you have to come up with a description of your ideal client. Remember these people are going to be reflections of who you are as a person. Who are they, what problems do they have, what motivates them, where can you find them, and most importantly... what outcomes do they desire. The more fleshed out this description is, the easier it becomes to design products and services and then to market to those potential clients.¬†

After that you need a mission statement. Why did you choose fitness out of everything else you could have chosen to do in life and what do you hope to get out of it? What are you trying to achieve? This should be fairly short. Try to keep it to just a few paragraphs.

Then comes your code of conduct. What governs your behavior as a professional in the fitness space? What principles guide your actions? I'm not just talking about moral or ethical ones here but those should be included. This will cover things like your first principles of fitness. What is the purpose of fitness? Where does fitness exist on the hierarchy of life? What things do you believe to be true about fitness? What things do you believe to be false? My code of conduct is about 12-pages long, but keep in mind that yours doesn't need to start out that long or ever get that long and you should update and edit your code of conduct as needed as you develop as a business person in the fitness space.

Once we know our identity, its time to focus on information.

# 2. We don‚Äôt sell special, secret or general information. We sell pertinent information.

As coaches we have to eliminate the idea that we hold some kind of secret or special information that we have to offer the client. Fitness is a simple system of inputs (actions) and outputs (results) that we need to discover how to implement and realize while understanding that the human element is the most important and most difficult part of our job. Stop focusing on simple information. This may surprise a lot of people since coaches are essentially skilled knowledge workers and information is essentially what we sell. We are basically teachers. Coaching is an information game, but the internet and AI has destroyed the ability to sell simple and general fitness information. Someone is likely much better at providing information in a digestible way than you are and is most likely providing it for free somewhere out there. You have to provide information in a way that allows a client or customer to implement inputs and realize outputs.

(I have also added 5. Entertainment and 6. Belonging to this list. For most new knowledge workers, these are going to be much more difficult to implement. In the future I'll probably drop a full article just on how we achieve these six things.)

What we really should be focusing on selling is specific information delivered in a way that provides:

1. Expediency
2. Simplicity
3. Personalization
4. Feedback

‚ÄúHow can I provide these people with specific information more quickly, more simply, in a more personalized way, and provide feedback?‚Äù

This is really what you should ask yourself whenever you have an idea for any kind of product or service. But first you need to ask:

‚ÄúBut how do I know¬†**what specific information**¬†to deliver more quickly, more simply, in a more personalized way, and provide feedback on?‚Äù

This all comes back to your identity and the niche that your identity matches up with. If you still don‚Äôt know what that is, you really should start focusing on it. Once you know your identity and your niche, you simply provide those people with value.

# 3. You must provide value.

Value is a word, much like niche, that has become fairly meaningless in business, including business in the fitness industry. Essentially a product or services value is directly related to how well it allows a given customer to realize their desired outcomes. Outcomes are simply whatever they get out of purchasing a product or service.¬†

Here is a fairly comprehensive description of the things that can increase value to a potential customer or client:

(Honestly, this is still a framework that I am refining. The current version now has 12 line items, but it's not quite ready for a public release. This version is still perfectly fine. The new one is just better because it is easier to implement. Better is always better after all.)

**1. Alignment with Abstract Outcomes:**

This is how closely a product or service aligns with the unseen and often unexpressed outcomes that a client or customer desires. This is the most difficult metric to manipulate. Often this is something that takes much longer to develop and requires a coach to be very specific in their niche and messaging which allows potential customers and clients to identify us with their abstract outcomes. This is because different abstract outcomes will be more or less valuable to a given niche market and especially a given individual based on their desired outcomes and current internal discomforts. This is really how well a brand can cohere with the desired identity of a customer. The more closely a product, and more importantly a brand, can align with a niche market or an individual‚Äôs abstract outcomes the more valuable it will be to that niche market or individual.

**2. Magnitude of Concrete Outcomes:**

Concrete outcomes are the outcomes that are seen and most often directly expressed by a client or customer. Not all concrete outcomes are created equal. Losing ten pounds for summer and getting stage lean for a professional physique competition are two vastly different outcomes even though they exist along the same spectrum of weight loss. Helping someone lose ten pounds is a less valuable outcome than getting someone stage ready for a physique competition in general. Teaching someone to make $10,000 is less valuable than teaching someone to make $100,000 in general. The greater the magnitude of the concrete outcome, the higher the value of the product or service.

**3. Alignment with Concrete Outcomes:**

Just like abstract outcomes, there needs to be an alignment with Concrete Outcomes. Losing ten pounds is more valuable to a general weight loss client than getting stage ready is but losing ten pounds is also far less valuable to a physique competitor than it is to a general weight loss client. Helping someone make $10,000 in their market is far more valuable than teaching them to make $100,000 in a market which they don‚Äôt participate. The more aligned a concrete outcome is to the desires of the customer, the more valuable a product or service is.

**4. Perceived Likelihood of Reaching Outcomes:**

This is how likely a customer believes that purchasing a product or service will be to help them reach both their desired abstract and concrete outcomes. The greater the perceived likelihood of achieving an outcome, the more valuable the product or service is.

**5. Actual Likelihood of Reaching Outcomes:**

This is how likely a product or service will actually result in a customer reaching their desired abstract or concrete outcome. Keep in mind that we have the most control over concrete outcomes. Unfortunately, perceived and actual likelihood of reaching outcomes aren‚Äôt always aligned. Still, the more capable a product or service is at reaching a desired outcome, the more valuable a product or service is.

**6. The Amount of Time Required to Reach Outcomes:**

This is the delay between purchasing a product or service and reaching a desired outcome. Speed is an incredibly important metric when creating value. Reaching a goal physique in 24-weeks is more valuable than reaching it in two years. The quicker an outcome can be reached, the more valuable a product or service is.

**7. The Amount of Effort Required to Reach Outcomes:**

This is the amount of work a customer is going to have to do after purchasing a product or service before they reach their desired outcome. Reaching a goal physique through a lower level of effort is more valuable than reaching a goal physique through a high level of effort. This is especially true if there is no difference between the amount of time required to see outcomes. The less work is required, the more valuable a product or service is.

**8. The Amount of Sacrifice Required to Reach Outcomes:**

This is the amount of comfort a customer will have to give up after purchasing a product or service before they reach their desired outcome. Reaching your goal physique while being more comfortable is more valuable than reaching your goal physique while being more uncomfortable. This is especially true if there is no time difference between the amount of time required to see outcomes. The less comfort is required to be sacrificed, the more valuable a product or service is.

**9. The Permanence of the Outcome Once it is Reached**

This can also be considered as how long the outcome lasts once it is reached. The longer an outcome lasts after the discontinuation of a service or the use of a product, the more valuable that service or product is. Keeping your goal physique once you reach it is more valuable than regressing once a service has been discontinued or a product has been consumed. Imagine how valuable an oil change would be if you were able to offer one that lasted the lifetime of the car? Far more valuable than the one that is required every 3,000 miles.

When ever you are designing a product or service, ask yourself how could you adjust these metrics in order to make it more or less valuable? This not only gives you a list of things you absolutely should do to increase the value of the product or service, but it will also give you very clear boundaries on the things you absolutely should NOT do with your product or service.¬†

**To figure out what you should do, ask yourself these questions:**

How could you better align your product or service with the desired abstract and concrete outcomes of the customer? How could you increase the customers perception of the likelihood that they would reach those outcomes? How could you increase the actual likelihood that the customer would reach those outcomes? How could you do it quicker? How could you do it with less effort? How could you do it with less sacrifice? How could you make those outcomes last longer?

**To figure out what you should NOT do, ask yourself these questions:**

How could you misalign your product or service with the desired abstract and concrete outcomes of the customer? How could you decrease the customers perception of the likelihood that they would reach those outcomes? How could you decrease the actual likelihood that the customer would reach those outcomes? How could you do it slower? How could you do it with more effort? How could you do it with more sacrifice? How could you make those outcomes not last as long?

These questions shouldn't just be asked when initially designing a service or a product. They should also be used when you refine a product or service. Most people will never refine products or services, they will simply create new products or services because of the false belief that ""new is always better"", but that isn't true. A product or service is better when it provides more value relative to the cost of the product. Simply put, better is better.

# 4. To provide value you must solve problems.

When looking at any of the metrics above, we simply need to identify the associated problems, break them down into their most basic components, brainstorm solutions, choose the best ones, and then fulfill those solutions.

When expressed like that it seems simple and clean but in practice it can be much more difficult and messy. I wont go super deep into problem solving here as that could be its own post but I will talk about the two distinct kinds of problems we face when creating value, Closed-Ended and Open-Ended Problems, and go over some basics on solving them.¬†

Closed-Ended Problems¬†are those which have defined answers. There is one correct answer and reaching that answer is simply done through the application of a skill through an established process. You know exactly when you have the answer to these problems. These problems do not need to be applied to the real world to know if they are correct. Once these solutions are applied there is immediate feedback on the value of the solution. These are Left-Brain Problems. Mathematical problems are an example of Closed-End Problems.

Open-Ended Problems¬†are those which have undefined answers. There are often many correct answers but there is often only one most correct answer. There is often no established process by which to answer these questions. You may never know if you have the best answer to these problems, and you may never have the best answer to this problem. You only know if you have a better or worse answer than other available answers. These answers must be applied in the real world to see if they are correct. Often there is a significant time delay between the application of these solutions and the ability to recognize the value of the solution. These are Right-Brained Problems. Creative and conceptual problems are examples of Opened-Ended Problems.

People who solve Closed-End Problems are rewarded by how complex the problems they can solve are and how fast they can solve those problems. The reward for solving these problems is highly predictable and linear. The reward for Closed-Ended Problems is most often monetary and immediate but is often less than the monetary reward for Open-Ended Problems. People who solve Closed-Ended problems are generally viewed as competent based on a case-by-case basis and based on their individual problem-solving efforts.

People who solve Open-Ended Problems are rewarded not just by how complex the problem is and by how quickly they can solve them but also by how completely they can solve those problems and how easily and meaningfully those solutions can be applied. The reward for solving these problems is much more unpredictable and is often exponential relative to the other solutions available for these problems. The reward for Open-Ended problem solving is more than simply monetary and is often also highly intrinsic. The monetary reward for Open-Ended Problems can be much higher than those of Closed-Ended Problems but often is far from immediate. People who solve Open-Ended Problems are generally viewed as more competent based on the scope of their body of work and are evaluated based on the collective of other solutions that have been provided to the area of the problems in question.

The most competent providers of value who receive the greatest compensation for their efforts are those that can solve both kinds of problems at a very high level.

In order to solve Closed-Ended problems you need to have a specific skill-set that you then apply to a given problem. This is fairly simple. If you wan't to solve calculus problems, you learn calculus. The better you get at calculus, the better you get at solving calculus problems. Anyone can learn calculus, but only some people will take the required time to really get good at the skill of calculus in order to solve more complex problems. Still, to solve calculus problems, all that is required is for you to sit down at the desk and get to work.

A lot of people try to solve Open-Ended problems the same way they solve Closed-Ended problems. It doesn't work that way at all. This is why you see so many horrible solutions to Open-Ended problems created by some very intelligent people. This is something I see people who focus on being ""optimal"" do all the time. Being optimal is one of those Left-Brain activities, so this probably shouldn't be surprising.

In order to solve Open-Ended problems, you need to first take in the problem in it's entirety. Try to know everything you can about it. Try to see it from all angles.¬†

Then you really need something I call couch-time. You need to be separated from the problem. You also need to be free from distractions. Most people have an incredibly hard time doing this. First. they can't stop obsessing over the problem so they can't see it clearly. Second, they can't keep them selves from being distracted so they never give their brains the space required to solve the problem.

Here are two ways that I go about getting in couch-time.¬†

First, I like to get up early and go take a walk. I have a beautiful nature reverse near me so this is pretty easy for me to do. But you could go walk anywhere. Even just go to a running track and do the loop. I will walk for 45 to 90 minutes. If I leave the house at 7:00 in the morning, I will get back home between 8:00 and 8:30 most of the time. I leave my phone at home. I do not listen to music. I do not listen to podcasts. I take a tin of Swedish nicotine pouches, a cup of coffee in a travel mug, and a little digital tape recorder I got on Amazon a few years ago. I also started taking 200mg of L-Theanine right before I head out and this seems to help with relaxing.¬†

Then while I walk, I try my best to not think of anything specific. I just walk. I never try to force it. Eventually, your mind will start doing the hard work for you. Things will seem to just pop up from out of nowhere. The more you do this, the better the things that will pop up. When these things do pop-up, I record them on the digital tape recorder. By the end of a 90 minute walk, I may have 20-30 minutes of new ideas that I need to listen back to once I get home. When I do get home, I go upstairs to my second office and get on my writing computer and transcribe everything I have said into a document. I like to use Obsidian for this, but really anything works that will give you some kind of organization.¬†

Once everything is out on the page, I start writing and fleshing it out. Usually this will go on till about noon. More often than not, these things become meaningful solutions to Open-Ended Products even if it takes a few different days to really get it nailed down. Sometimes, the solutions I come up with are NOT the ones I set out to solve. This is okay. I just go with it and keep going. Most of the time now-a-days, I don't set out with any specific problems in mind. I just let whatever solutions come to me that are bouncing around up there in my mind.

The second way I like to do this is what I do when walking outside isn't really an option. This is something I learned from novelists and is where I originally got the name ""couch-time"", but I actually think it is less effective than long walks.¬†

I think the low effort physical activity is highly beneficial to the process. I think the stress relief from walking through the woods, also goes a long way to help with relaxing. I think the repetition of the ""ritual"" is also very important. That all fits into a set of higher level ideas that I'm not going to dive into today, but are probably something that you should keep in mind.¬†

Anyway, I literally do everything I would do for a walk, but instead of going out for a walk, I just sit in the recliner in my second office for 45-90 minutes in silence. Generally, I will turn the lights off when I do this. It takes longer to get relaxed but it still works when I need it.

Being able to do this is a skill, the more you practice it, the better you get at it. The more solutions you create, the better the solutions usually get. The only problem is that it can be pretty unpredictable. You might have a time bound problem that you're mind just isn't ready to solve yet. Sometimes, you may also may come up with better ideas at night than you do in the morning. Sometimes I come back and after transcribing my notes, and I find that I'm not ready to turn those ideas into solutions yet. That' no big deal. I just accept it.

Once you have a new solution, you then need to test it in the real world to make sure it is actually a good solution. From there you can repeat the process and keep refining those ideas, or, if need be, come up with entirely new solutions.¬†

Another incredibly important part of this process is down time, but that is itself a much more meta level topic and probably needs to be discussed on it's own and at length to really be valuable for anyone else to implement.

Some of the most ""productive"" times in my life are when I have devoted a whole lot of my schedule to ""couch-time"" and ""down-time"" and have stopped worrying about simply being busy. I truly believe that if you really want to solve high-level Open Ended problems, that you need to give yourself enough time and space to actually allow that to happen. To set up a life where you can do this regularly and without burning out and crashing, I think you need to find a way that you can do this cyclically. Again, that's a more high level topic and not one were going to talk about today, but it is something you should keep in mind.

# 5. To become good at solving problems, you should pursue Craft. To become great at solving problems, you must pursue Craft.

If I truly only could tell people, including my younger self, one thing, this is it. The problem is that even I likely wouldn‚Äôt be able to grasp it when I was a new coach. That‚Äôs not because the idea itself is so complex or especially esoteric. It‚Äôs because a person needs to experience it to truly get it. You have to buy into the process to be able to see all the benefits of it, and how it will go on to influence and inform every decision you make. Once you see it, you can‚Äôt unsee it and it will fundamentally change you and how you pursue coaching or anything else you choose to apply its principles.

If I were trying to explain it to myself, I would first describe Craft as:

""Craft is the disciplined pursuit of transforming ideational vision into tangible reality through the mastery of knowledge, skills, techniques, and focused consciousness. It is the deliberate process of bringing an inner conception to external manifestation.""

See that sounds like some woo-woo bullshit and would likely go far over my head so I would continue to describe it in a highly logical and progressive manner that is highly related to what we have just spoken about:

* You need to upgrade your knowledge.¬†
* Once you upgrade your knowledge you will be able to apply that knowledge.¬†
* Being highly competent at applying a specific set of knowledge is called a skill.¬†
* Practicing a skill is the transmutation of specific knowledge into something concrete.¬†
* Being highly competent at a skill means having the knowledge required to know what instruments are necessary to practice that skill.¬†
* An instrument by which we apply knowledge through our skills to create something concrete is called a tool.¬†
* Being able to direct our consciousness to determine where, when, how, and to what end our skills are applied is called focus.¬†
* The longer we are able to focus over a given period of time, the more productive we can be in producing something concrete.
* The more productive we are, the more valuable each hour of hard work we complete becomes.
* The application of valuable hours in the creation of something concrete in a specific discipline is called Craft.
* Therefore, the acquisition of knowledge, application of skills, selection of tools, and deployment of focus, sustained over time to create something concrete in a specific discipline is called practicing a Craft.
* A person who practices Craft is called a Craftsman.
* An Amateur is an individual who desires to practice a Craft but has not yet taken the steps required to become serious about its practice.¬†
* A Hack is an individual who pretends to practice a Craft but does not genuinely engage in true Craftsmanship.
* An Apprentice is a Craftsman who is currently acquiring the basic knowledge and skills required to practice a Craft and has a very limited ability to maintain focus and be productive.
* A Journeymen is A Craftsman who has gained a working competency in the knowledge and skills required to practice a Craft and is now expanding their ability to maintain focus over longer periods to become more productive.
* A Master is a Craftsman who has achieved a high level of competency in the knowledge and skills required to practice a Craft and possesses the ability to maintain a high level of focus over extended periods, resulting in exceptional productivity.
* An Artisan is a Craftsman who has attained such an advanced level of knowledge and skill competency, along with the ability to deploy extreme amounts of focus, that the practice of the Craft itself becomes the primary purpose rather than productivity. They transcend the craft because their engagement is driven by the intrinsic value of the practice itself, not merely the outcomes it produces. This is the goal of any Craftsman and achieving it likely doesn‚Äôt exist in reality.

After I had worked through this description of Craft, I would do everything possible to try and persuade myself to then engage in the pursuit of it. I would tell myself that there is extreme fulfillment, joy, and peace in its pursuit unlike anything else I have ever felt. I would tell myself that this is the turning point, the epiphany that changes everything moving forward.",4,1761090660.0,personaltraining,2,0.83,False

I quit cigarettes a little over a month ago. I didn't even consciously think about it but my cagfeine intake has significantly increased s8nce I quit. I went from 1 cup of strong coffee per day, estimated at 150 to 200 mg according to the internet, to 3 cups a day plus several diet pepsis. I'm easily getting 600mg a day since quitting smoking.

I didn't realize nicotine reduces the impact of caffeine by 50% so I'm getting a lot a lot more caffeine and it has double the impact.

My blood pressure has always been normal to low. Now it is very very high. My hr is also very high all the time. I had bloodwork and ecg and whatever other heart test with the wires and they were normal. No reason for high bp.

I am cutting down starting tomorrow, probably to 200mg. I don't catlre about the withdrawal cuz I'm so stressed about the high bp that I'm freaking out and making it worse.

I did, but I couldn‚Äôt negotiate hours. I ended up working as a barista and my parents said it‚Äôs shameful because I was getting ready to go into a masters.

Carmen came running in with her phone waving.
‚ÄúGirls! Coffee Day just posted something huge on their channel!‚Äù

We all huddled around her phone. On the screen was Zoe, smiling in her signature black outfit, saying:

> ‚ÄúThe smoothie wave has hit Coffee Day! Inspired by our young creative fans, we‚Äôre launching a Smoothie Special Week! And we‚Äôd like to invite some very special guests to help us kick it off.‚Äù



Then the camera panned to a list ‚Äî and right there it said:

> Special Guests: The SisterBean Crew



We screamed. Loud.
Penny dropped her water bottle, Kira fell off her chair, and even our teacher sighed with a smile.
Winfrey whispered, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre‚Ä¶ part of a Coffee Day commercial.‚Äù

After school, we rushed to the caf√©. Zoe greeted us with that confident, star-like grin.
‚ÄúYou girls really did it again,‚Äù she said, handing us aprons with little fruit badges. ‚ÄúYour SisterBean spirit spread faster than caffeine!‚Äù

The Coffee Day staff ‚Äî Ayaka, Haruka, Anastasia, and even Mr. Tanaka ‚Äî were already setting up blenders and cameras.
Zoe clapped her hands. ‚ÄúOkay! This is going to be a fun short film ‚Äî nothing too serious. Just joy, color, and teamwork. You‚Äôll make your own smoothie combinations on camera. But‚Ä¶ try not to redecorate the floor again.‚Äù
Everyone laughed, especially Amy.

The shoot was full of cheerful chaos. Carmen accidentally pressed the blender lid wrong, sending fruit pieces flying. Penny tried to pose elegantly and ended up with mango puree on her sleeve. Amy herself burst into laughter during her line, ‚ÄúSmoothies make smiles!‚Äù

At one point, Zoe joined in beside Amy and winked at the camera. ‚ÄúAnd sometimes, they make memories too.‚Äù

When the shoot wrapped, everyone clapped. Zoe promised the video would premiere on Coffee Day‚Äôs social page this Friday.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make everyone fall in love with smoothies,‚Äù she said.

Before heading home, the girls sat together at the caf√© counter, sipping the ‚ÄúMud Queen Mango Fusion,‚Äù one of the new drinks named after the viral show.
Kira raised her glass. ‚ÄúTo friendship, color, and smoothies!‚Äù
Amy giggled. ‚ÄúAnd to Zoe ‚Äî the coolest mentor ever!‚Äù

Ive recently gotten into espresso after years of filter coffee (aeropress, clever dripper etc.) And pulled the trigger on a new Quickmill popup and DF64 grinder. Ive been trying to experiment with preinfusion, by lowering the pressure initially before pulling the shot, then after around 7 to 10 seconds turn the valve up to 9 bars. However, somwtimes i notice that the machine at lower pressur will make a whistling sound, but when i bring the pressure back up, it stops. Not sure if it's something to be concerned about, and based on some quick research, it looks to be harmless, but wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this or has any additional insights. 

Happy brewing and thank you!",1,1761090094.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

The partisan burns with ideological fever; the median voter hums with the tepid vibration of air-conditioning and algorithmic newsfeeds. The median American does not think, they sample opinions like one samples coffee flavors, preferring whichever blend offends least and goes down smoothest for themselves. They are post-political, post-historical, post-tragic: an organism that confuses safety for virtue. Their conscience is calibrated by polling averages and personal experience and hearsay. Their god is ""normalcy."" They recoil from conflict as though passion itself were impolite.

If the partisan is the fanatic child of conviction, the median voter is the docile orphan of comfort. One screams into the void; the other scrolls past it. One is at least alive. The other is a murmuring algorithm of appetites, living proof that democracy, left to its own devices, does not elevate mankind but merely launders its laziness into policy.

The tragedy is not that these people vote poorly; it is that they vote exactly as they live: cautiously, inattentively, and always a little bored.

We were roommates, friends, lovers, all at once. I believed we were building something stable. Then one Tuesday I noticed the phone was blank. No ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù text, no brief check-in like usual. I brushed it off. I‚Äôd been stressed about starting a new job.

That evening I pulled up his profile on a shared laptop (yeah, awkward choice) and found messages he‚Äôd never told me about - long threads with another girl, some flirty, some casual, some curiously affectionate. My heart rushed. I questioned the date stamps, looked at the ‚Äúread‚Äù markers, and scrolled until I found screenshots and voice notes he must‚Äôve known I could access if I cared to dig. It wasn‚Äôt wild partying or a one-night mistake. It was ongoing for maybe months like weekend brunches he didn‚Äôt mention, early morning texts, disappearing acts I thought were work.

I confronted him. He was shocked, upset, said it was ‚Äújust a phase,‚Äù and blamed loneliness in a new city for it. I told him I needed truth, not excuses. He admitted parts of it, but every time I asked for details he withdrew. The trust broke, but what stung most was the self-doubt. I kept asking myself why I didn‚Äôt see it sooner, how I missed all the signs.

Then came the hardest part: staying in the same apartment because my lease ended in six months. Pretending my stomach didn‚Äôt drop when I heard his phone ping. Sitting beside him, pretending all was normal, even though my mind raced with what-ifs and memories that now twisted. I kept telling myself I‚Äôm overreacting, that maybe I was paranoid. But something told me I wasn‚Äôt.

Finally I made a decision. I gave notice, moved out two weeks earlier than planned. No dramatic confrontation, just quiet packing, boxes in the hallway, one last coffee before handing over the key.",2,1761089710.0,cheating_stories,1,1.0,False

September 6th, 1995

When Maia and I got back to the house, the glow of the daytime faded away behind the trees. After getting Maia onto the couch I quickly locked the door and checked outside of the window. It was dark, the details and textures of the trees and the ground were becoming unfocused, melting into one dark smudge. I looked for Robin, or anyone winding up to throw dead animals at the house. When I was satisfied nothing was out there, my attention shifted back into the living room as Maia squirmed on the couch. She looked pale, the bandage on her head needed to be changed. She had vomited again while jogging back to the house, and her movements were slow like she was underwater.¬†



Maia: Hey, do you see anything?¬†



Me: No, it‚Äôs too dark. I think I‚Äôm going to put the couch in front of the door, then move us into the bathroom.



Maia: Yeah, sounds good. Could you get me some water? I‚Äôm just so thirsty.¬†



Me: You got it, one second.¬†



I squeezed her hands and she smiled at me, letting me know she was okay. I walked quickly into the kitchen and found the first clean-ish looking glass that I could. I filled the glass about halfway, water sloshing over the sides as I grabbed the glass with two shaking hands, and twisted the knob shut. Maybe I was in a rush, and didn‚Äôt turn it all the way, or maybe it had always been like this, but slow drops of water splattered down into the food crusted sink. Rushing back to Maia I gave her the water, sitting next to her while she sipped it slowly. Looking down into the cup, she grimaced.¬†¬†¬†¬†



Maia: Fuck.¬†



Me: What?¬†



Maia: That lady was right, the water here issogood.¬†



I laughed and offered to get her another glass, but she shook her head and placed the glass on the windowsill behind her. There was no movement outside the window, the only sound we heard was the *tap tap tap* of the water dripping in the kitchen.¬†



Maia: You think that she‚Äôs going to come back tonight?¬†



Me: Robin? I really hope not.¬†



Maia: What‚Äôs the deal with her? She comes to your doorstep and tries to get in, and when she can‚Äôt she spews cryptic bullshit about wells and looking glasses. What does she want?



I felt a chill go down my bones, I anxiously peered out the window again and again. I was scared to see anything looking in, I was too scared not to look. *Tap tap tap* went the water in the kitchen sink. I looked back to Maia, who I could tell was trying hard to stay in the moment.¬†



Me: I- I think she wantsta get into your basement. She wantsta get to the well down there.¬†



Maia: The well? Simon that‚Äôs not how modern wells work, there isn‚Äôt going to be a hand crank and a pail down there, it‚Äôs all plumbing.¬†



Me: I know I know, but why hide the door to the basement like that? Someone‚Äôs not going to go through all that effort to paint it and then hide it behind a table if there isn‚Äôt something worth hiding. I‚Äôve also- I‚Äôve also had dreams about the basement, Maia.¬†



Maia: Dreams? Whatkinda dreams?¬†



I filled her in on my dream about George, his bloated face rushing out of the well in the basement, the feeling of dread and the wet walls all around me. As I spoke her face got even paler, if that was possible.¬†



Me: I don‚Äôt think George let her in, I think he hid the door from her specifically. But she knows, she is lying and trying to get us to get into the house.¬†



Maia was quiet for a long moment, I counted 12 *taps* before she groggily offered this:¬†



Maia: Isn‚Äôt- aren‚Äôt there monsters that like to hang out around wells? Trolls or pixies or something like that? What if that lady is something like that? A monster that got separated from her well?¬†



Me: You think that Robin is a monster?¬†



Maia: I don‚Äôt think that headless birds watching you is normal, so clearly she‚Äôs not either. I mean Jesus Simon, there is something terribly wrong here, and clearly she knows something about it at least.¬†



Me: What do you think?¬†



Maia: What do I- I think we need to getoutovere the second it turns light out, I don‚Äôt need to know what‚Äôs going on here! If she wants the well, she can have it!



I was going to respond to this, but something captured my attention first, Maia‚Äôs too. When a sound is soft enough, rhythmic enough, you put it in the background. The tapping of the water fell perfectly into that category, the quiet *tap tap tap* serving as white noise to the panic that was going on. As Maia and I talked, we hadn‚Äôt noticed that the sound seemed to no longer come from the kitchen, but instead in the rooms above us. The *tap tap tap* faded into something new, faded into a quiet *thump thump thump.* Someone was walking around in the second story of the house.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†



We stared at each other in silence as a muffled footfall walked above us, in a tight circle. It was consistent, each foot falling in rhythm to the other, spaced out as if whatever up there was walking around a big mess. It was like a grim march, whoever was upstairs did not have the concern to creep around in the house. It didn‚Äôt care if we knew it was there. I didn‚Äôt know if it would remain upstairs, I didn‚Äôt know if it would soon travel down into the living room where Maia and I were. I had to check.¬†



Me: I‚Äôm going upstairs.¬†



Maia: Are you insane? No, not alone you‚Äôre not.¬†



She tried to rise off of the couch, but wobbled as soon as she was on her own two feet. She put out her hands and I caught them, easing her back down onto the cushions. She looked both furious and scared as I tried to comfort her.¬†



Me: I‚Äôm not waiting to see if whatever is upstairs, comes downstairs. It might even just be a racoon that came in through a window that I have to shoo out.¬†



Maia‚Äôs face twisted into a look of pain and anger-fueled sarcasm.¬†



Maia: God, do you really think it‚Äôs a racoon?¬†



Me: No, not really.



Maia: Jesus fuck, just be careful, be quick!¬†



Shuffling through my bag, Maia grabbed a flashlight and her pocket knife and pressed both of them into my hands. It was one of those cheap eveready plastic flashlights, the kind you have to smack once or twice to make sure that they worked. The knife was a flip blade, but it looked sharp. I hoped I didn‚Äôt either, that the lights upstairs would work, and there wasn‚Äôt anything I needed to cut.¬†



The stairs were covered in a cheap shag carpeting, I felt it crunch and bristle harshly against my shoes as I ascended. The steps were steep, the very edge of my heels hung off the end of each step as I ascended. Upon reaching the top, I found a light switch near the end of what looked like a short hallway. I was relieved to find that once I flipped it, light illuminated the second story. That relief was short lived however, as I realized that that bulb was old, and was dim and flickering. The hall was bathed in a dim orange glow, making the wood paneled walls and carpet look fuzzy and unfocused. It was good that Maia didn‚Äôt come up, I thought that the squinting would have made her puke again.¬†



The hallway was, unshockingly, littered with debris and garbage. Crumpled up pieces of paper were kicked to the sides of the walls, or trampled down under countless footfalls. In the dim haze of a burnt out bulb I saw two doors, one on either side of the hall. One was open, and I saw the edge of a box and more papers spilling out of it into the hall. The other door was further down the hall, and stopping to listen: I heard a slow *thump thump thump* coming from that room. Why had I come up? Why didn‚Äôt I just let whoever was up here have that room, and Maia and I barricade the bathroom shut? Maybe it wasn‚Äôt enough to have just one safe room, maybe I needed this entire house to be safe. All this time I had called this George‚Äôs house, my mom‚Äôs house, the house I needed to clean. But maybe at some point, maybe a small part of me considered this house mine, and for that reason I didn‚Äôt want anyone in it uninvited. I felt my feet bring me forward.¬†



As I crept to the door, I looked down at the paper that I was treading across. It varied a lot from envelopes to newspapers to entire pads of paper. Most were yellowed with age, some were multi-colored post it notes. I quickly noticed the common denominator between all of them. Strange letters were scribbled again and again into the papers, some of them looked like English, while others looked like geometric shapes. There were no swirls or curves to any of them, they were all sharp edges and exact lines. I recognized the shape of them, the penmanship. They were all done by the same person who scratched those word‚Äôs into the kitchen table. Some were methodical, others were hasty. There were so many of them I felt cold thinking about how long it took to write all of these, over how long a period of time? Was Robin there to hound him the entire time? Was Robin the reason to write all of this?¬†



I passed the first door, looking in as I went. It was hard to make out details from the weak glow of the hallway light, so I clicked on my flashlight. I gave it a wave around the room, peering deeper into the secrets of this place. I saw a twin size bed in the corner, the frame sagging from the massive weight of cardboard boxes. Several desks lined the walls, all covered in boxes and books. This room seemed filled with reams of printer paper and loose leaf, novels and pamphlets peppered every surface available. I didn‚Äôt have time to be curious, I crept forward past it and towards the door at the end of the hall.¬†



*Thump. Thump. Thump.*¬†



The door was cheap, the type of pine that splintered and frayed at the edges. The brass doorknob was dented and dull, yet it still reflected in the dull glow of my flashlight. A light fixture was in the wall next to the door, right underneath it was a switch to the hallway lights. The orange glow was giving me a headache, I averted my eyes from the light. My reflection in the doorknob was warped, the expression on my face stretched and contorted into a look of anguish. I rested the flashlight down on the ground, freeing a hand while I brandished Maia‚Äôs pocket knife. When I grabbed the door knob, it was cold, and the rhythmic thumping on the other side of the door stopped.¬†



My breath caught in my throat, my hand tightened on the door handle. I strained to listen, but I heard nothing on the other side. I wanted nothing more than to just dismiss the noise and run back downstairs, that the problem wasn‚Äôt a problem anymore. But I had made it this far, what if it started back up the moment that I left? I didn‚Äôt want to take the chance, this was my responsibility after all. Arm tensing with fear, I twisted the door handle quickly and put all of my weight into swinging it open.¬†



The wood grinded against itself in the frame. I took a step back, inspecting the door. I almost laughed at the absurdity of it, the door opened out into the hallway, it didn‚Äôt swing into the room like I originally thought. But I didn‚Äôt laugh, not when I heard the frantic *THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP* of whatever was on the other side of that door sprinting towards it.¬†



I tried to get out of the way, but it was too fast. The door swung open and struck me in the head, causing my vision to black out for a moment. I fell to the floor, my back and shoulder slamming into the wall behind me as I went down. The knife went flying down the hallway, crashing to the floor far out of reach. I rubbed my head, it was pounding. I felt a throbbing pain begin to spread across my shoulder and down into my spine.¬†



Looking back to the doorway, I saw what had knocked me over. A naked man, perhaps in his 60s, put a finger to his lips. With his other hand, he reached out and flicked the lights to the hallway off.



Scrambling across the ground I reached out for the flashlight, as I did I felt hands try and grasp me around my ankles. Kicking out I fumbled for the flashlight, my hands imprecise from fear and adrenaline. Eventually grabbing hold of the light I spun and shined it towards the door, towards the old man. But he wasn‚Äôt there.¬†



My chest heaving, I scanned the light around the hallway, but he was not there. Had he retreated back into the room? I got to my feet, I reached out and flicked back on the lights, the hallway illuminating once more. The door was still open, and I sent the light of my flashlight through the crack of the door. There was another bedroom before me, trash and other objects scattered around like the rest of the house. I didn‚Äôt get the chance to get a good look however, as something else pulled my attention away.¬†



From downstairs, the front door opened.



Me: Maia? Maia?!¬†



I called out, but there was no response. What was going on? I slammed the door shut in front of me, grabbed the knife off the floor, sprinted back down the hallway and to the stairs. When I thundered down the steps and into the living room, my worst fears were confirmed. The front door was wide open, and Maia was nowhere to be seen. I raced to the front door and looked around frantically, my flashlight illuminated nothing but trees and the thick darkness between them.¬†



Me: Maia!¬†



This wasn‚Äôt like her, she wouldn‚Äôt just wander out into the night. She wouldn‚Äôt leave me, and she wouldn‚Äôt exit the house especially when Robin was out there somewhere. Had Robin done this?¬† She said she would be back, did she come here when I was upstairs? But how did she get Maia to leave? Fuck, had the old man grabbed Maia? Was he working with Robin? God, I didn‚Äôt have time to answer that, Maia was out there somewhere and I needed to be there for her! Like she had been there for me.¬†



George‚Äôs woods were larger at night, thick like oil and just as suffocating. I felt my breath pressed out of my lungs with fear, but I didn‚Äôt have the luxury of taking a deep breath. My best friend was out there, and it was my job to bring her back safely. Smacking the flashlight to make sure it was working, I ran out into the woods.

After some years, I just signed a new contract as Fixit employee. This company is so A.W.E.S.O.M.E I couldn't stay away forever.

BTW, what you guys are able to design is so incredible. After 2000+ hours in the game, I still use the shoe-box design. What I do like in this game, it's optimization. To the 4th decimal.

Years ago (v.0.7), I had found equations regarding how to optimize (not maximize !) the plastic & rubber production in a mixed factory based on the oil tripling principle. It was about the exact amount of fuel to be distributed between refineries producing rubber or oil.

These equations are really working perfectly. If you need 265.4 plastic and 287.7 rubber, you can have them without wasting anything, and with 100% efficiency.

Here they are: 

Fuel(Plastic) = Quantity (Plastic) x 17/27 + Quantity (Rubber) x 8/27  
  
Fuel (Rubber) = Quantity (Plastic) x 7/27 + Quantity (Rubber) x 16/27

But I never found out how these equations were established. Maybe it was published somewhere, but no luck. So I grabbed a sheet of paper, a pencil, (old dude here) and some liters of coffee.

And I was able to re-establish them (me happy), so I would like to share this with you in case some are interested, or could make some use of this.

**Recipes**

1) Recycled plastic : 30 rubber /min + 30 fuel/min = 60 plastic / min. Simplified : 1 rubber + 1 fuel = 2 plastic

2) Recycled rubber : 30 plastic / min + 30 fuel / min = 60 rubber / min. Simplified : 1 plastic + 1 fuel = 2 rubber

P = desired plastic output (items / min)

R = desired rubber output (items / min)

F(P) = fuel allocated to refineries producing plastic

F(R) = fuel allocated to refineries producing rubber



**Analysis** : we will use the known ratios in the recipes to replace the item quantities by the fuel quantities.

Recycled plastic produce 2x F(P) plastic and consume F(P) rubber

Recycled rubber produce 2x F(R) rubber and consume F(R) plastic

So the plastic balance : 2xF(P) = F(R) + P **(Equation 1)**

The plastic produced internally equals plastic consumed by Recycled Rubber plus plastic desired output

And the rubber balance (without external source coming from the polymer) : 2xF(R) = F(P) + R **(Equation 2)**

The rubber produced internally equals rubber consumed by Recycled Plastic plus rubber output.

Without the rubber coming from the polymer, it would then be quite simple : just replace in Equation 2 the value of F(P) coming from equation one, and voil√† ...

But there is the initial rubber input coming from the polymer...

**More recipes**

1 crude oil / min = 4/3 HOL / min + 2/3 polymer / min

2/3 plolymer / min = 1/3 rubber / min

**More variables**

C = consumed crude oil

R(i) = initial rubber

**More analysis :** From the above recipes, we can state that R(i) = C/3. But we also know that P+R = 3xC (that's the principle of the system - oil tripling system)

C = (P+R) /3

R(i) = (P+R) /9

When we build the factory, we feed R(i) into our systems, for kick starting the chain, so the equation 2 is modified.

2x F(R) + R(i) = F(P) + R

From equation 1 : F(R) = 2x F(P) - P

Substitute into the modified equation 2 :  3x F(P) = 2xP+R-R(i)

F(P) = \[2xP+R-R(i)\] /3

F(R) = \[P+2xR-2x R(i)\] /3

You just then need to replace R(i) with (P+R) /9 and simplify. At the end, you will obtain :

F(P) = (17P+8R) /27

F(R) = (7P+16R) /27

And this perfectly checks out, even if you set P or R to 0, you are back to a pure plastic 3 to 1 or rubber 3 to 1, but the fuel values are still perfect.",1,1761089352.0,satisfactory,3,0.67,False

Dumped My Ex, Back to Being a Pianist


Chapter 1 Who'd Want a Used-up Woman?


""Avie, kiss me.""

""Charles, have you slept with Shannon?""

""I haven't touched her in three years. Come on, open up.""

Then, a woman's sultry, teasing moans filled the video.

That steamy clip shattered Shannon Lowe's fragile illusion of happiness.

Below the video was a single message: 'Shannon, Charles has stayed faithful to me for three years. You'll never understand the joy of having s^x with him. What's the point of clinging to a marriage like this? Be smart and file for divorce yourself.'

It was sent by Charles Pearson's affair partner‚Äîhis ex-girlfriend.

Shannon had discovered Charles' cheating a week ago. She hadn't responded to the messages, but apparently, her silence was unbearable for the sender.

She gripped her phone tightly, tears streaming down her face, impossible to contain.

Another message popped up‚Äîan address to some club.

Shannon wiped her tears, changed into a white T-shirt and jeans, and headed to the club. She arrived at the door of the private room where Charles was holding a gathering.

The door wasn't fully closed. Just as she was about to knock, she heard the voice of Charles' friend, Kanye Musk, from inside.

""Charles, you and Averi have been all over the news lately. Shannon hasn't caused a scene?""

Her raised hand fell slowly. Shannon lowered her gaze and leaned against the wall.

She really wanted to hear how Charles would answer.

""Cause a scene? Does she dare? The Lowe family's done for. Who'd want a used-up woman I've already had?"" Charles' voice carried a casual certainty, as if the world belonged to him.

""You're that sure? Don't forget, Shannon used to have plenty of people falling for her.""

Charles let out a mocking laugh. ""After all these years, she's been clinging like a lovesick fool. How could she ever leave me?""

Hearing that, Shannon laughed suddenly, a bitter, incredulous laugh at her own foolishness, her naive heart.

Her laughter broke, tears sliding down her cheeks.

Five years ago, Charles had saved her at school. She was just a girl then‚Äînaive and tender‚Äîand a young man had stormed into her world. To her, he was a hero straight out of her dreams. From that moment, she was hopelessly captivated. The day he learned she was the Lowe heiress, their bond was sealed.

After graduation, they got married quietly. Charles didn't want anyone labeling him a status-chaser relying on the Lowe family, so their marriage stayed hidden.

A year ago, her parents died in a plane crash. The Lowe family was carved up by her uncles and cousins. She went from the high and mighty Lowe heiress to an orphan. Charles, the illegitimate child, was taken in by the Pearson family.

Charles' mother began belittling her with sly, cutting remarks, mocking her as a woman who couldn't bear children.

However, no one knew the truth. In their three years of marriage, Charles had never touched her. He claimed he was sick, incapable of intimacy.

The reality? He had remained faithful to his first love, never able to be with any woman except Averi Taylor. But to the world, he claimed she was just a used-up woman.

A sc*mbag, through and through.

The conversation inside the room continued.

Shannon, however, no longer had the courage to listen.

She turned and walked away.

Feeling completely hollow, she stepped out of the club and walked slowly along the sidewalk.

After a few steps, she suddenly crouched down, hugging her arms tightly and burying her face in them, silently sobbing.

Her shoulders trembled with each shuddering breath, like a fragile flower battered by a stormy night, evoking an almost unbearable pity.

""Done crying?"" A deep, magnetic voice sounded above her.

Through tear-blurred eyes, Shannon looked up. The man stood in the moonlight, backlit, holding a tissue. The soft glow seemed to compete with him, and the black beads around his wrist caught the light, gleaming sharply.

She recognized that handsome, striking face instantly. ""David, what are you doing here?""

Hadn't he gone abroad five years ago?

""Wipe it."" David Hogan's voice was cold and measured, carrying no hint of extra emotion.

""Thank you."" Shannon took the tissue and dabbed at her tears. As she stood, she wobbled.

Just as she was about to fall, David reached out and steadied her by the arm, then quickly let go.

""Because of Charles?""

Shannon lowered her head and said nothing, a silent confirmation. She didn't notice the flicker of emotion in his eyes.

""Shannon, you used to be a ray of sunshine. Even now, don't let yourself be swallowed by darkness,"" David said, expressionless.

She remained silent, yet tears continued to stream down her face.

Was he trying to comfort her?

""Thank you, David. I‚Äî""

Her words were cut off by the sudden screech of a black Bentley pulling up to the curb.

Charles stepped out of the back seat, moving fast. He grabbed Shannon's wrist and yanked her roughly toward him. ""Why are you here? Who is this man?""

His gaze landed on David, and his pupils constricted slightly. ""David, weren't you abroad? When did you come back?""

David's eyes swept over Shannon's slightly furrowed face, detached and cool. ""Mr. Pearson, you're hurting her.""

Only then did Charles release her, noticing the redness around Shannon's eyes. ""You've been crying?""

""Something stung my eyes. I ran into David and chatted briefly. Let's go home,"" she said, calm but distant. She looked at David and said, ""Goodbye, David.""

""Goodbye,"" David replied, then turned and walked toward a Maybach parked a short distance away.

Shannon stared after him, momentarily stunned.

""Shannon, I'm still here, and you're staring at another man?"" Charles' expression darkened, his chest tightening in a flash of jealousy and anger.

Shannon finally tore her gaze away, her voice icy and devoid of emotion. ""I was just looking. Unlike you, who flirts with another woman and makes the headlines.""

Charles was taken aback. ""Jealous?""

She didn't want to waste another word on him. She turned toward the curb to hail a cab, but he grabbed her wrist and shoved her into the Bentley.

""Charles, are you out of your mind?""

As she landed in the back seat, her forehead slammed against the glass, making her scrunch her face in pain.

""Shannon, there's a limit to jealousy. Avie and I didn't do anything. It was just a dinner at a gathering‚ÄîKanye and the others were all there.""

Avie. Ha! What a sweet little name to call her by.


Chapter 2 You Have the Guts To Leave Me?


""Charles, I want a divorce.""

The air inside the car froze, heavy and tense.

Charles' expression darkened in an instant. ""Shannon, you just ran into David, and now you're asking for a divorce? What, you think you've already lined up someone new and suddenly have the guts to leave me?""

The word divorce ignited a fury in him that he couldn't contain.

Shannon's face flushed with rage. The very next second, her hand struck his cheek with a sharp slap.

""Charles, you were the one who cheated with Averi. David has nothing to do with this.""

It took Charles a moment to register that she had actually hit him. His expression grew even darker as he ground his teeth.

""Don't you dare think about divorce. With the Lowe family gone, you don't stand a chance against me.""

""You don't love me. Why won't you just let me go?"" Shannon's eyes brimmed with tears, disbelief breaking her voice.

She had loved this man for five years, only to discover he was this vile.

She had once believed that when Charles claimed a health condition and refused to touch her for three years, it was proof of his deep devotion to Averi.

But now, when she was the one asking to leave, he refused.

Typical‚Äîhe wanted to have his cake and eat it too.

""I'm not with Averi the way you think,"" Charles explained smoothly. ""I even bought you a gift. Let's just go home. Don't make a scene."" His face slipped back into that practiced elegance, his hand lifting with feigned tenderness as if to stroke her hair.

Shannon turned her head away, avoiding his touch.

Charles' brows drew together, displeasure flashing in his eyes. He hated her resistance. ""You should learn to be content. I don't like this side of you.""

Shannon acted as if she hadn't heard a word he said. She turned her head, watching the blur of skyscrapers and neon lights streak past the car window, her chest tight with frustration.

Divorce wasn't going to be easy.

Suddenly, his phone rang, shattering the silence.

Through the glass, Shannon saw Charles pull out his phone. The screen lit up with a name‚ÄîAvie.

Her lips curved into a bitter, mocking smile. Then, she watched him answer.

""Charles‚Ä¶ my stomach‚Ä¶ It hurts. Can you come over?""

‚Ä¶

The next second, something clattered to the floor on the other end.

""Avie? What happened?"" Charles' face drained of color, panic twisting his voice. He leaned forward and shouted at the driver.

""Stop the car!""

""Mr. Pearson,"" the driver said cautiously, ""this is the interstate.""

""I said stop!"" Charles barked, his expression thunderous.

The driver didn't dare argue. He pulled over onto the emergency lane.

""Shannon, something's happened to Averi. I need to go. Get out here‚ÄîI'll send someone to pick you up.""

Shannon's face went pale. ""Charles, this is the interstate. You're telling me to get out in the middle of the night?""

""I'll have someone come for you. You'll be fine."" He didn't wait for her reply. He shoved open the door, circled around to her side, yanked the door open, and pulled her out in one swift, unhesitating motion.

And then he was gone.

Shannon stood frozen, staring at the vanishing taillights until her vision blurred. Her eyes burned hot, and tears finally spilled over.

‚Ä¶

Shannon's phone and purse were still in her own car, which she had left in the club's parking lot. By the time she walked back to Bale Breezeway Villa, an hour and a half had already passed.

The first thing she did was head straight to the study and print out the divorce papers.

When the printer spat out the final page, she carried them back to her master bedroom.

After washing up, she stepped out of the bathroom‚Äîonly to see Charles standing at her vanity, the divorce agreement clenched in his hand.

""How did you get in here?"" Shannon froze mid-motion, the towel still pressed against her damp hair, her expression hardening.

Three years ago, on their wedding night, Charles had told her he had a health condition, so s^x or anything exciting isn't safe for him. They had lived in separate rooms ever since. Even her own bedroom was a place he rarely set foot in.

Because she loved him, she had accepted a marriage without intimacy.

Now, Charles' face was grim as his eyes locked on her. ""Did you just ignore everything I said earlier?""

""If you have no objections, sign the divorce papers,"" Shannon replied evenly, continuing to dry her hair without haste. ""When my parents were alive, they helped you plenty. I'm asking for 100 million as settlement‚Äînot much, considering.""

Her calmness only unsettled him more. In a fit of rage, Charles tore the divorce agreement into shreds, his voice breaking with controlled fury.

""Shannon, I told you‚ÄîI will never agree to a divorce.""

She didn't flinch. ""Then, I'll take you to court.""

Averi had already handed her more than enough evidence to drag the Pearson family through the mud. All Shannon wanted was a clean break.

""Court?"" Charles sneered. ""Do you still think you're the Lowe heiress? In all of Kirkwood, what lawyer would dare take on my divorce case?""

He let the words hang in the air, then slowly walked up to her, softening his tone.

""Shannon, if this is all because of Averi, you don't need to be upset. My body's healed now. We can finally have s^x. We'll have a child, and you can quit your job to stay home and raise it.""

Shannon felt sick to her stomach the moment she heard his words.

She wanted nothing to do with a rotten man like him.

She stepped back, putting distance between them.

Charles' expression grew darker still. He grabbed her hand, then hauled her up by the waist and carried her toward the bed.

""Charles, let me go!"" Shannon's face drained of color, her voice trembling.

He said nothing, laying her on the bed before pinning her down. With one swift motion, he seized both her wrists and forced them above her head. ""Come on, you‚Äôre my wife.""

Shannon struggled with everything she had, but he was stronger. Her resistance only seemed to excite him further.

When she sensed the change in his body, her pupils widened, shock flooding her eyes.

""Charles, even if we're married, forcing yourself on me is a crime.""

The cloying trace of another woman's perfume clung to him, and it made her stomach lurch. She gagged twice, her throat convulsing.

Charles' face turned ashen, dark as a storm cloud.

""Shannon, haven't you always loved me? Why are you pushing me away? Is this about David?""

Pain shot through her as he pressed down harder, and she reacted on instinct‚Äîjerking her knee upward between his legs.

A sharp hiss tore from his mouth.

Charles doubled over, clutching himself, his face twisted in agony as he rolled to the side, bellowing, ""Shannon, are you insane?""

Seizing the chance, Shannon scrambled upright. Her gaze was cold as ice when it met his. ""Charles, you stayed a virgin for Averi for three years. Fine‚Äîgo to her. I'll let you have each other. Let's end this cleanly.""

Her voice cut like glass. ""I saw the video of you in bed with her. Now I know you're not impotent. If you'd told me the truth sooner, I would never have married you.""

At her words, something flickered across Charles' face‚Äîguilt.

The day Averi returned to the country, he had drunk too much. When he woke, they were in the same bed. He hadn't resisted her temptation, and later, sober, he went back for more.

He had thought he'd hidden it well. He hadn't expected Shannon to know all along.

""Shannon, I promise you‚ÄîI'll never see Averi again. Please, trust me this once.""

Shannon's lips curved in a cold, mocking smile. ""Oh? A man who can't even control himself thinks he's qualified to talk about trust?""

""Do you have to twist every word I say? I mean it this time.""

""Mm. I'm going to sleep now. Get out.""

Charles wanted to stay, to lie beside her, but the throbbing pain from where she had kicked him burned like fire.

He groaned, climbed off the bed, and forced himself to sound composed. ""In a few days, I'll take you to Seabrook, let you relax a little. Stop with the tantrums. The company's busy, and I don't have time to coddle you.""

""Fine,"" Shannon murmured faintly, already lying back down.

Her cold indifference grated on him. Frustration churned in his chest, and with the pain still gnawing at him, he turned and stalked out of the bedroom.


Chapter 3 Luring Men In


The next morning, Shannon didn't get up early to make breakfast for Charles like she used to.

She waited until after he left before she came downstairs.

When she saw the breakfast sitting neatly on the table, her lips curved into a cold, mocking smile. Without hesitation, she swept it into the trash.

Her phone buzzed with a message. 'Come over.'

'On my way.' Shannon sent the reply and drove straight to Pearson Manor.

The moment she walked in, she spotted Charles' mother, Brittany Gavros, lounging on the couch. Beside her sat Averi, dressed in a white dress.

The two of them were chatting like dear friends, the scene warm and picture-perfect.

What a touching sight‚Äîone mistress doting on another.

Shannon leaned against the doorway in a black slip dress, her waist-length hair tumbling down her back. A tiny beauty mark at her brow only sharpened the allure of her striking face.

Brittany noticed Shannon lingering and frowned with open irritation. ""Shannon, are you planning to guard the door like a statue? Don't you see we have company?""

She added curtly, ""Avie wants tiramisu. Go make some for her.""

Shannon gave a soft laugh, sauntered forward, and lowered herself onto the couch with a calm, detached air. Her voice was smooth but icy. ""Doesn't she have hands of her own? If she can't make it herself, maybe she doesn't need to eat it.""

The bluntness left Brittany momentarily stunned, her expression darkening at once.

After Shannon's parents passed away, she had all but placed this woman on a pedestal, never once talking back. Until now.

Brittany snapped, her voice sharp with disapproval. ""Shannon, how could you be so rude? Avie is our guest. What's the harm in making her something to eat?""

""I don't want to.""

""You live off my son, drink his money, refuse to give him children‚Äîand you can't even make a simple dessert?"" Brittany's face flushed crimson with rage.

Shannon calmly lifted her phone, tapped the screen, and suddenly the living room filled with Charles' voice.

""Avie, kiss me.""

""Charles, have you slept with Shannon?""

""I haven't touched her in three years. Come on, open up.""

What followed were breathy moans and soft cries‚Äîa soundtrack that made the air in the room burn with shame.

""Shannon, have you completely lost your mind?"" Brittany's fury spiked. What kind of wife would humiliate herself by playing proof of her husband's affair?

Averi stared at her, stunned. She had sent the video hoping Shannon would quietly choose divorce‚Äîbut she never imagined Shannon would broadcast it right in front of her future mother-in-law.

Shannon ended the video with a click, her smile cutting like glass. ""The one who's lost her mind is you. You expect me‚Äîthe wife‚Äîto serve his mistress? What does she have besides spreading her legs to lure men in?""

Her gaze slid to Brittany. ""Or is it your claim to fame‚Äîclimbing your way into the Pearson family as a mistress yourself‚Äîthat gives her the audacity?""

The words hit harder than any blade, carving straight into their pride.

""Shannon, you're insane!"" Brittany exploded, grabbing a cup and hurling it across the room.

Shannon shifted smoothly aside, the porcelain shattering harmlessly behind her.

Her voice was cold, commanding, utterly unlike the gentle, graceful woman she used to be. ""Ms. Gavros, I want a divorce from Charles. He refuses to sign. You two can figure out a way to put his name on those papers.""

Brittany's eyes went wide with shock, then she recovered, hissing, ""Is that how you beg people?""

""Beg? Why should I beg?"" Shannon said. ""Charles cheated first. Once this video gets out, Old Mr. Pearson will have no choice but to kick him out. You've waited all these years to climb up‚Äîare you really willing to be driven out of the Pearson family?""

Brittany's face flushed and then paled, but she had no answer.

""I'm leaving the divorce papers here. Make him sign them and contact me.""

Brittany picked up the papers and glanced at the settlement amount. When she saw 100 million, her expression changed.

""One hundred million‚Äîare you worth that?"" she spat.

""The video on my phone is worth it,"" Shannon said coolly. ""And I should thank Ms. Taylor for her generous help.""

Averi sat frozen. The woman who looked so composed and gentle had been ruthless all along, stirring trouble right here in front of them.

Brittany, petty and small-minded, cared only about money. Losing 100 million would be counted against her‚Äîshe wouldn't forgive that. The thought made her furious.

""Why you!"" she began, voice venomous. ""A fallen daughter of a wealthy family, swaggering in here and threatening me. Who do you think you are? No wonder your parents‚Äî""

Shannon rose and walked straight up to her, then slapped her across the face so hard it echoed in the room.

That should get Charles to sign, she thought.

""How dare you hit me?"" Brittany shrieked, clutching her cheek, blood roaring in her ears. She lunged to strike back, red-faced with rage.

Shannon grabbed her wrist and, without hesitation, slapped her again.

Brittany tumbled to the floor and hit her forehead on the edge of the coffee table.

""Argh! Shannon, I'll kill you!"" she screamed.

Shannon stepped back a few paces, watching Brittany rage like a madwoman. She smiled coolly. ""I'll be waiting for good news from you both.""

With that, she turned and walked out without a backward glance, her silhouette sharp, graceful, and untouchable.

Brittany, her cheeks still stinging from two slaps, went wild‚Äîshattering everything she could get her hands on in the living room.

‚Ä¶

Leaving Pearson Manor, Shannon lifted her gaze to the distant sky. For the first time in years, her chest felt light and free.

For three years, Brittany had tormented her for not bearing a child‚Äîmocking, belittling, cursing. After her parents' deaths, the cruelty only deepened.

It was Brittany who had pushed her to the edge of depression. At least half the blame belonged squarely to her, but now, she didn't have to swallow that poison anymore.

As she slid into her car, her phone rang. Charles.

""Shannon,"" his voice thundered the moment she picked up, ""you actually went to my house and struck my mother? Are you out of your mind? Go and apologize to her right now, or I'll never forgive you.""

Once, Shannon would have cared about his anger. Once, because she loved him, she endured everything in silence.

Now, she simply said, ""Suit yourself.""

Then, she hung up and started the engine, steering toward Belvoir Manor‚Äîthe estate her parents had gifted her on her eighteenth birthday.

She parked in the underground garage and took the elevator to the twenty-first floor.

When the doors opened on the first floor, David stepped in.

""David, you live here too?"" Shannon asked, surprised.

He was dressed in black loungewear, cradling in his arms a strange-looking cat‚Äîa gray body streaked with uneven yellow blotches, awkward and oddly unattractive.

It clashed almost comically with his face, which was so strikingly handsome it bordered on unfair.

""Yeah.""

""What a coincidence. I live here too. What kind of cat is that?""

David glanced at her, his eyes calm and steady. ""A domestic shorthair. Its name's Lemon.""

Shannon had always loved cats. Before she met Charles, she used to feed strays and even kept a little tabby of her own. But he hated cats, so she gave it up to a shelter.

""Lemon's a nice name,"" she said softly. ""I used to have a cat too.""

David's lips curved faintly. ""Is that so? Want to hold it?""

Shannon reached out, and Lemon melted into her arms without the slightest fuss, curling up obediently against her chest.

When the elevator stopped, she carefully handed it back. ""This is my floor.""

She stepped out, only to realize David had followed. She turned instinctively. ""David, you don't have to walk me‚Äî""

Her words trailed off as she watched him unlock the apartment right next to hers with a fingerprint scan.

Shannon froze, caught off guard. ""You live here?""

Two apartments on the floor. Just side by side. What were the odds?

David gave a small nod. ""Yeah. I didn't expect us to be neighbors.""


Chapter 4 I'll Starve Myself


Charles got a call from his mother and rushed straight to Pearson Manor.

The moment he stepped inside, Brittany came forward in tears. ""Charles, you have to teach Shannon a lesson. Look at what she did to me.""

Her voice trembled with both grievance and fury.

Charles glanced at the red handprints on his mother's cheeks, his brows tightening. His first instinct was disbelief.

Shannon loved him so deeply. She treated his mother with almost worshipful deference‚Äîhow could she possibly raise a hand against her?

""Shannon has always been gentle and kind. She's respectful and devoted to you. She wouldn't hurt you.""

""You think I'm lying? Ask Averi. Didn't that shameless woman strike me?""

Shock flashed in Brittany's eyes. She hadn't imagined her own son would doubt her.

Had he truly fallen in love with Shannon?

That useless woman, living off her son's money and still daring to hit her‚ÄîBrittany was determined to force a divorce.

Averi's hands, hanging at her sides, curled into tight fists. Something flickered in her eyes, but she softened her voice sweetly. ""Charles, she is telling the truth.""

""Charles, you must stand up for me,"" Brittany pressed on quickly. ""You don't even like Shannon. Just divorce her already.""

She had deliberately left her cheeks untreated, wanting her son to see Shannon's cruelty for himself, but his reaction was nothing like she'd expected.

The moment he heard the word divorce, a shadow crossed Charles' face, so subtle it almost went unnoticed. A restless irritation stirred inside him.

""Mom, I've never once thought about divorcing her,"" Charles said, his voice cool and distant.

At that, both Brittany and Averi froze.

""What did you just say? You've been married three years without touching her. Isn't that because you don't love her? Then, why refuse the divorce?

""I can't believe I raised such a worthless son. What if Shannon goes online and exposes your affair? Have you thought about the fallout? Your grandfather never liked the two of us to begin with. Do you want him to throw me out of the Pearson family?""

Brittany collapsed onto the couch, slapping her thigh as she wept like she'd been wronged by the entire world.

Charles yanked at his tie in irritation. ""Mom, I'm the CEO of Pearson Group now. If Grandpa wants to drive you out, he'll think twice. Stop crying.""

Averi bit down on her lower lip until her eyes turned red. Her voice broke with despair. ""Charles, I gave you my first time. What am I supposed to do now?""

Tears slid silently down her face, the kind that stirred pity in anyone who saw her.

Charles felt his agitation sharpen. Yet, despite himself, he pulled Averi into his arms with a trace of tenderness. ""Avie, don't cry. I'll make it up to you.""

""Charles, I'm sorry. I never should've come back and put you in this position,"" Averi whispered, clinging to his waist. Her fingers drifted, barely brushing against his chest.

His body went rigid for an instant before he caught her hand.

Brittany watched her son closely, reading every flicker of emotion across his face. She pressed on, ""Charles, you can't betray both of us. I'll never forgive Shannon for striking me. If you refuse to divorce her, I'll starve myself until you do.""

""Mom, why are you forcing me like this?""

""Am I the one who forced you to cheat with Averi? Shannon made it clear‚Äîif you don't sign the papers, she'll go public about your affair and drag your name through the mud.

""The Lowe family may be down and out, but you know better than anyone how much Old Mr. Riley favors her. Don't say I didn't warn you.""

Brittany had struck where it hurt.

The real reason Charles refused to divorce was simple. First, staying married to the fallen Shannon made him look good‚Äîhe gained a reputation for loyalty.

Second, while he didn't love her, Shannon was beautiful, graceful, and adored him unconditionally. He relished the feeling of being so completely loved.

""Mrs. Pearson, please don't push Charles like this,"" Averi pleaded softly.

Brittany's heart ached as she replied, ""You foolish girl. My son wronged you, yet you're still defending him.""

One played the hard role, the other the gentle‚Äîleaving Charles with nothing to say.

‚Ä¶

After tidying up Belvoir Manor, Shannon got a call from her best friend Emma Riley, who was away on a business trip overseas.

""Shan, are you alright?"" Emma's worried voice came through the moment the line connected.

""I'm fine. Did you see the news?""

The next second, Emma erupted in fury. ""Do you even consider me your friend? Something this big, and you didn't tell me? If a friend back home hadn't sent me the link, I wouldn't have even known. Charles dared to cheat? That shameless toad doesn't even look good, yet he's still trying to play the field.

""Back then, when Averi dumped him, everyone knew about it. And now he has the nerve to crawl back to her? Has he already forgotten what he swore to you when he proposed?""

Shannon had already cried once yesterday, right after seeing the video Averi sent her. Since then, she hadn't shed another tear.

But when she heard her best friend raging on her behalf now, her eyes still brimmed with emotion.

She and Emma had known each other since childhood‚Äîfrom kindergarten through college, even studying abroad together. They had both majored in piano, and after graduation, they co-founded a piano agency and training studio.

Emma had witnessed every step of her story with Charles.

""Emma, I want a divorce.""

""That rotten man? Who's he good for? Finally, you see it‚ÄîCharles is a fool who's never been worth it. I'm booking a ticket home right now. If I don't kick that jerk into the ground myself, I'm not Emma. Married and still cheating‚Äîhe has zero sense of what it means to be a husband. Pathetic.""

When Shannon heard her best friend fuming on her behalf, ready to back her every step of the way, her lips curved in the faintest smile.

""Don't be angry. You still have a few days left on your trip. When you're back, I'll return to the company with you.""

""You're Shannon, the piano prodigy. This is how it should've been all along. From now on, we'll build something of our own. Let that loser see what it means when powerful women rise to the top.""

Shannon stepped out onto the balcony. Sunlight spilled across her face, and she let out a soft laugh. ""Yeah. I know. I won't be foolish again.""

Emma took a sip of water, then asked carefully, ""Shannon, we're best friends. If you're hurting, you have to tell me.""

She knew exactly how much Shannon had loved Charles.

Ever since Shannon's parents' accident, she had carried mild depression. Once radiant like the sun, she had grown quiet and withdrawn.

Back in kindergarten, Emma had been chubby and often bullied. Shannon had beaten up the kids who tormented her, leaving Emma glued to her side from that day on.

""I'm fine, really. Don't worry. Better to see his true colors now than later.""

The only consolation was that Charles hadn't touched her in all three years of marriage.

If he had, the thought of it would have sickened her beyond words.

""That's good. I was worried you'd hide away somewhere, drowning in sadness.""

Shannon let out a soft laugh. ""I'm not sad. By the way, do you remember David?""

""You mean that infuriatingly handsome legend from Grandvale University who vanished out of nowhere?"" Emma jumped in immediately.

David‚Äîthe legend every student at Grandvale University still talked about. With a perfect SAT score, he'd earned his place there and went on to shine in academics, the arts, and even athletics.

Anyone who had ever set foot on that campus knew his name.

""Yes,"" Shannon said. ""I ran into him.""",1,1761089337.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

to make a sunrise

I‚Äôll never see.‚Äù

  


Some days

that line feels like prophecy.

Other days

like exhaustion

trying on hope‚Äôs clothes.

Most days

it just feels true.

Because maybe that‚Äôs the job

to pour your light

into a world

that keeps dimming.

To love something

that might never love you back.

To keep showing up

after the magic runs out.

  


Some mornings,

the world feels indifferent,

like it‚Äôs daring me to stop caring.

And still,

I do.

I care.

Like muscle memory.

Like the only part of me

that refuses to rot.

Because if we stop

who keeps the fire?

Who holds the line?

Who reminds the world

that progress isn‚Äôt a miracle,

it‚Äôs maintenance,

and no one‚Äôs keeping score?



The librarian

slipping a book

into a child‚Äôs hands

and saying,

you‚Äôll like this one.

The bus driver

waiting that extra minute.

The line cook

humming old love songs

just to keep the kitchen from caving in.

The neighbor

who picks up what the storm tore down

like it‚Äôs theirs to mend.

The quiet, unthanked army

of people

who hold the world together

with duct tape,

patience,

and a kind of kindness

that doesn‚Äôt post about itself.



And I think about the ones before us

the marchers, the builders,

the women told to wait,

the men mistaken for threats,

the students

who sat in silence

so the world could move.

They burned their lives, too.

They never saw the sunrise either.

They just kept striking matches

in rooms full of wind.

Maybe that‚Äôs the point

not to win,

not to finish,

but to keep the match lit

long enough

for someone else

to notice the smoke.

The world calls it foolishness.

And maybe it is.

But there‚Äôs a holiness

in foolishness

the kind that limps,

the kind that mutters, under coffee breath and paper cuts, fine,

and does it anyway.

  


Some nights,

I wonder if the fire‚Äôs even real,

or if we‚Äôre just pretending

the warmth is enough.

But I keep tending it.

Because someone has to.

Because somebody always did.

Progress isn‚Äôt light.

It‚Äôs a flicker.

A whisper.

A tired voice

that still says,

keep going.

The people before us

never saw the world they built.

They built it anyway.

And now

it‚Äôs our turn.

To build what we‚Äôll never touch.

To fight for a light

we may never stand in.

To leave behind a warmth

someone else

will mistake for grace.

Maybe the point

was never to last forever.

Maybe it‚Äôs to love something

so fiercely

that it learns how to live

without you.

So we keep going

stitched together by purpose,

held up by borrowed faith.

  


I burn my life

to make a sunrise

I‚Äôll never see.

Not for me.

For the strangers

who will wake beneath it,

stretch toward the light,

and call it good.

Sylvia Garden complete! This was a very intricate DIY 3-D kit. It was pretty difficult and it seemed every step had some sort of obstacle to overcome which was good because it made me use my noodle. Lots of things had to be done twice because they were done, then became undone, then had to be redone. My advice is glue everything! For example, the coffee menu over the bar was supposed to attach to a bracket and hang at an angle, but it later got knocked off and there was no way to reach to push it back in from behind. I just glued it on straight and moved on. The stairs? For the love of God, glue them. Another issue was a defective green ceramic bead needed for a vase, which I just replaced with pink pearl beads I had. I like the look even better!

The biggest issue I had was a major missing piece, the righthand wall to the secret garden. I have no idea what happened to it. I hope it‚Äôs enjoying that place where lost socks and every hair tie I have ever bought go. Anyway, I wound up making a template using the lefthand wall with a few adjustments, cutting out 2 pieces of cardboard and 2 cardstock, gluing them together and painting them to match the wood paneling. It came out pretty good, I think.

The final build is absolutely beautiful. Just look at her! So much detail! The secret garden isn‚Äôt visible at all from the front, a true secret. In fact, there are a lot of hidden surprises in this nook, such as the ladder to the loft and the kitty. There are FOUR windows that open. The lights worked perfectly and had plugs, yay! Even though it took forever and was frustrating at times, it was worth it. I feel so much pride in this one. I‚Äôm not sure I want to go back to snap kits after this.

I was fourteen when my parents divorced. Their arguments had been constant, walls shaking, doors slamming, glass shattering. I learned to hide in the corners of my room, headphones blaring, trying not to notice the hollowness growing in my chest.

My mother moved out, my father retreated into work, and I was left in a fractured house that smelled of bleach and old coffee, echoing with absence. It wasn‚Äôt just the loneliness; it was the feeling that life was broken and that I was powerless to fix it.

That‚Äôs when I discovered lucid dreaming. The first time I realized I was aware inside a dream, I felt a surge of control I had never known. I could bend the world to my will. Anything I imagined, it would come true.

For the first time, I could create happiness, create worlds where pain didn‚Äôt exist, where I wasn‚Äôt an observer to suffering.

I was God.

At first, I started small.

I walked through forests that glowed in shades I had no names for. I could summon rainbows that arched across violet skies. I made friends in these worlds, creatures that spoke with humor and kindness, always ready to listen, always ready to understand. I relived moments of joy I hadn‚Äôt had, moments of safety and warmth that never existed in real life.

I even conjured, what I deemed perfect, my own home. The divorce never happened. The resentment my parents had in reality was hidden by the loving joy that I created.

We could be a family.

But it wasn‚Äôt enough. My control became more deliberate, more urgent.

I wasn't satisfied. I needed more.

I experimented.

I created cities that pulsed with light and sound, alive like music made manifest. I created beings who adapted to me, who grew and learned from me. I rewrote history, making impossible things happen, mountains sprouting overnight, rivers folding in impossible loops, stars that danced to the rhythm of my thoughts.

I was addicted.

As I built society further and further, I couldn't differentiate if it I was in reality or asleep. It didn't matter. I didn't want to wake up.

The more I created, the more my waking life seemed hollow, gray, insignificant.

What felt like days, even weeks, were merely only hours of sleep. I'd even mastered to bend my created beings with their own self thought. Their free will in my dreams. Oh how they dreamt and I, their God, could see their own dreams. Their own thoughts and ambitions.

Then I made a decision I will never forget.

I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped interfering, if I left my creations to their own devices. If I, their creator, were to disappear.

Within the dream, I closed my eyes and fell into a dream within a dream, drifting deeper than I ever had.

I left my creation running, untended, leaving it to course as it would without me.

At first, it seemed fine.

The sky remained impossibly vibrant. Oceans of liquid crystal rippled beneath my feet. Cities thrived, creatures and people roamed, oblivious to my absence. But subtle changes began. A tower leaned slightly, though I hadn‚Äôt touched it. A river hesitated mid-flow, as if uncertain where it wanted to go. The citizens paused, glancing around with expressions I had never taught them, curiosity, doubt, even impatience.

Then came the worse. A nightmare scenario.

The sky was red. And fire began.

I watched in shock as my world, that I have spent a millennia creating in my head burn. The people, the wildlife, the world itself ate itself.

Greed, hunger for power, the vial vines of corruption overtook my world, and I sat and watched.

What seem to be red liquid fell from the skies, putting and end to the flames.

When it was it over, I returned to my world, imagining that my presence would restore order. But the moment I stepped back, I realized it was already gone.

The survivors of my world looked at me with such anger. I could see how vile in their heart had become. Their being was split from me. From my control.

My world was no longer mine.

I awoke. The morning sun streamed through my curtains, but it felt alien. The apartment, familiar for so long, seemed different.

How long was I asleep?

Shadows stretched at impossible angles. The floorboards creaked where they never had. I told myself it was paranoia, that I had been dreaming too much, but deep down I knew something had changed. Something I had made had learned to exist without me.

That night, I returned.

I didn‚Äôt interfere. I simply watched.

The rivers were gone, the mountains were restless, buildings destroyed, and the citizens, my children, my creations, still tore at one another like a society that no longer needed its God.

And I realized, as I observed them, that I had indeed made a mistake.

The addictive thrill of creation, the power I had abused for joy and control, had given birth to something that might outlast me, something that might never remember me.

I woke, trembling. The air in my apartment felt heavy, as though weighted by expectation. I could almost hear the pulse of my dreamworld behind my eyelids, faint but insistent. A world I had built, one that no longer needed me, one that might thrive, change, and evolve beyond my comprehension.

I have not closed my eyes since. I fear what I might see. I fear what might remember me.

I fear that if I sleep again, I will discover a truth I cannot bear.

Cambridge, MA ‚Äî In what researchers are calling ‚Äúan unprecedented overlap of human and machine nonsense,‚Äù a panel of 17 tenured professors in Critical Gender Studies failed to convince judges that they were, in fact, human.

The event occurred during a campus symposium on ‚ÄúAffective Algorithmic Desire Ecologies,‚Äù where organizers inserted both ChatGPT-generated abstracts and faculty papers into a blind Turing-style evaluation. Judges‚Äîcomposed of graduate students, administrators, and one very tired IT worker‚Äîwere asked to determine which texts came from people and which from machines.

‚ÄúThe professors consistently scored lower than the AI,‚Äù admitted Dr. Raymond Chao, head of the symposium. ‚ÄúOne participant even described herself as a ‚Äòcyborgian node of posthuman becoming‚Äô during live Q&A, at which point several judges marked her down as definitely synthetic.‚Äù

Students in attendance reported little surprise. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in seminars where the professor just reads words like ‚Äòproblematize,‚Äô ‚Äòliminality,‚Äô and ‚Äòepistemic performativity‚Äô for 90 minutes straight,‚Äù said one anonymous graduate student. ‚ÄúHonestly, a chatbot at least throws in examples.‚Äù

When asked for comment, one of the professors responded via email:

‚ÄúTo reduce this discursive collapse into a simplistic binary of ‚Äòhuman‚Äô and ‚Äòmachine‚Äô is itself a violent act of epistemic closure.‚Äù

The email was later confirmed to have been generated by an AI text simulator as a prank.

Administrators stressed that no faculty would lose their positions. ‚ÄúTenure protects both groundbreaking scholarship and indecipherable word salad,‚Äù said a spokesperson. ‚ÄúBesides, the AI doesn‚Äôt qualify for a pension.‚Äù

One parent of a freshman expressed unease:

‚ÄúIn saner times, individuals with this level of detachment from reality would have been cared for in quiet asylums, given grippy socks, and gently redirected to finger-painting workshops. To parade them on stage in front of students as if this is higher learning‚Äîit feels cruel. Almost exploitative.‚Äù

University administrators dismissed the criticism, saying the symposium was ‚Äúa vital pedagogical site for exploring the boundaries of coherence, confusion, and coffee stipends.",0,1761088673.0,redscarepod,0,0.18,False

I awoke. The morning sun streamed through my curtains, but it felt alien. The apartment, familiar for so long, seemed different.

How long was I asleep?

Shadows stretched at impossible angles. The floorboards creaked where they never had. I told myself it was paranoia, that I had been dreaming too much, but deep down I knew something had changed. Something I had made had learned to exist without me.

That night, I returned.

I didn‚Äôt interfere. I simply watched.

The rivers were gone, the mountains were restless, buildings destroyed, and the citizens, my children, my creations, still tore at one another like a society that no longer needed its God.

And I realized, as I observed them, that I had indeed made a mistake.

The addictive thrill of creation, the power I had abused for joy and control, had given birth to something that might outlast me, something that might never remember me.

I woke, trembling. The air in my apartment felt heavy, as though weighted by expectation. I could almost hear the pulse of my dreamworld behind my eyelids, faint but insistent. A world I had built, one that no longer needed me, one that might thrive, change, and evolve beyond my comprehension.

I have not closed my eyes since. I fear what I might see. I fear what might remember me.

I fear that if I sleep again, I will discover a truth I cannot bear.

God may wake, but the universe He made‚Ä¶ does not need him anymore.",2,1761088628.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

The air smells like hot pool water and slow, expensive death.

I am twenty-six. I am a machine dressed in an orange apron. I am a forklift license. I am essential labor in a town that forgot how to labor.

I am Home Depot‚Äôs  perfected lifting machine.

The average age of the customers is seventy-eight. They move like sand through a filter. Slow. 
They need refrigerators. They need pallets of paver stones. They point a finger. I move fast.
The weight of the side-by-side refrigerator hits my spine. I do not groan. I hold the smile like a Buried Lie. Old people love a nice smile. It does not hurt. The retired cop tells me I‚Äôm too young to feel pain.

Fifty-pound VersaBond bags. Tossed them like pillows. My back is an oak tree. My forearms are the new wood.

 Pallets of RedGard stacked to heaven. I touched every box. 

My body is dense. Inert.

A man with a cane argues grout color. Bone versus beige. I tell him the ratio of sanded to non-sanded. I preach the gospel. He wants me to settle his small, final war. I settle it.

I walk past the other workers. They are all thirty years older than me. They move like driftwood in a dead tide. I am the tides. I became the missing department.

When the Pro order comes in, I move. Pro orders pulled while their coffee is still hot and I have to have their order ready before their war crimes against the public restrooms has ceased. 

I coordinated a four-pallet pickup like a war general. Sod. Mulch. Tools. All lifted, carried, returned. No complaint. The sweat runs down my temple. It is motor oil. It is lubricant for the machine they built.

Out of stock? I find the ghost product and make it real. I climb the steel rack. I don‚Äôt need the ladder. My muscle memory knows every load limit. I bring down the last box. It is the high-margin item. I sell it before the customer sees the price.

They came for a single tile. They left with the spacers, the float, the sealant, and a custom quote written on a napkin. They frame the napkin. They buy. This is my job. To make them believe in something. To make them buy what they need to fix their beige lives.

The body walks out at 6:30 p.m.
It is hard and functional. It is a tool perfected by Florida heat and the desperate needs of the geriatric.

I am the Home Depot‚Äôs empty soul. I am the Home Depot‚Äôs  perfect physical specimen. I will be here again at 10:00 a.m. I am always here.",29,1761088521.0,HomeDepot,12,0.89,False

Like, they hit pause on their personal evolution and are still living like it‚Äôs 2010 (or 2005 if they are in their 40s and 50s). It‚Äôs honestly like they stepped out of a time machine that only goes one way, and they‚Äôre so *deep* in it they don't even realize that the rest of us have moved on.

**Exhibit A: The 2000s Ladies = Flat, Weighed Down Hair and Jeans So Low Rise, You Can See the Shadows of Their Decisions.**  
Anyone else see women still with that flat, ironed to death, and dried out now weighed down hair like it‚Äôs 2005? It‚Äôs like they think their hair *has to* be so straight it could slice through glass. Honestly, I saw someone the other day and it looked like she straightened her hair with a pancake press. Are we not all aware that volume exists now? You can show curls, you won't be made fun of anymore for having curly hair like in the 2000s and 2010s when it was shamed. And the low rise jeans‚Ä¶ Why are women in their 40s and 50s still wearing jeans that are practically *under* their flat butts? I feel like I‚Äôm about to witness a *back tattoo revelation* every time I see someone walking by like this. Are we still pretending low rise jeans are in fashion in 2025? Or are we just *nostalgic* for the trauma?

**Exhibit B: The 2010s Men - Still Living Their Best Lumberjack**/**Hipster Life.**  
And what about the guys? I get that big beards were *the thing....* in the 2010s!, but I swear I‚Äôve seen men in their 30s who still look like they‚Äôre about to audition for ‚ÄúLumberjack #3‚Äù in a Hallmark movie. The plaid shirts, the beanies, the side-parted hair that is clipped short on the sides and back of their head with an electric $5 barber razor, it‚Äôs like their entire vibe screams ‚ÄúI'm heading out for a forest hike at 11 AM, but I‚Äôll be at brunch by noon.‚Äù Am I the only one who‚Äôs noticed that these guys now belong in a *museum*? Can we please stop wearing flannel like it's 2013??? Or maybe it‚Äôs some kind of cult that only they understand. Anyone else *uncomfortably* wondering if they‚Äôve become some fashion relic?

So many guys in their 30s still walking around looking like the poster child for a Portland coffee roastery or local craft brewery circa 2015?

So many women in their 30s with beanie hats still and nerd glasses with black plastic frames and entire arm sleeve of tattoos which make them look like a lizard.

It‚Äôs like the entire vibe is ‚ÄúI brew my own beer, I chop my own wood, and I still use beard oil I bought on Etsy.‚Äù Meanwhile they‚Äôre just going to Whole Foods in a flannel and Red Wing boots.

And somehow it‚Äôs still everywhere. I keep seeing dudes who genuinely look like they think they're about to star in a cologne ad for ""Essence of Campfire."" It‚Äôs always that heavy side part like they learned how to style their hair from a 2010 PSY Music Video or a 2012  YouTube tutorial and never updated the algorithm.

In our lives we all had our phases. But it‚Äôs 2025, and some of these guys are acting like they just walked off the set of a canceled AMC show about moonshiners with tech startups.

Do they know there are other haircut options now? Ones that women don't make of (because women now make fun of those styles as well)? Is there a reason we‚Äôre still holding on to the $5 barber fade and beard combo like it‚Äôs a personality from the Smith Brothers Cough drop logo?

Or am I just noticing it more now that everything else has evolved and they‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt?

Anyone else seeing this? Is this a comfort thing or some kind of Millennial Man uniform that no one told them expired?

**Exhibit C: The Snapchat Filter Addicts = When Did We Stop Growing Up?**  
I need to know, why are people still posting pics with Snapchat filters like it‚Äôs 2013? Is this still *a thing*? When you‚Äôre 30 and your face has dog ears or a random heart above your head, is that *still* a vibe? Because every time I see it, I feel like I‚Äôm in a parallel universe where people haven‚Äôt fully made the leap to adult life. Anyone else feel like you‚Äôve entered the Twilight Zone when you see a grown person using filters to look like a *cartoon character* in 2025? How is this still happening?

**Bonus Round: The Subtle Nostalgia ""Merch"" Hoarders = When Your T-shirt Collection is a Museum Exhibit.**  
Alright, what‚Äôs going on with the people still rocking Avengers T-shirts from *2012*? Are we *all* really holding on to that one piece of items like it‚Äôs the last link to our glory days? Can we agree that the *Iron Man* graphic tee was cool in 2012 but now it just feels like a relic of another era? Why are we clinging to that faded Captain America shirt like it‚Äôs some kind of treasure? Anyone else noticing that the ‚Äúnostalgia merch‚Äù is now becoming borderline tragic?

Why are they still using the word ""merch"" instead calling it ""merchandise"" or ""items"" like younger people do?  Anyone notice they still use the word ""craft"" or ""crafted"" as well like everyone overused back in 2014.

Do people just stop evolving after a certain age and just become a relic of the years they were in their teens or early 20s and just ride that out the rest of their lives?

That is my rant and question of the day from observing life in an urban city. Those in their teens and early 20s have adapted to the 20's but the older people get the more distantly stuck they seem to become.

I intentionally wanted to create a high effort post instead of a short description low effort post, so thanks for reading....Why is everyone else's thoughts on this in our society?

Cambridge, MA ‚Äî In what researchers are calling ‚Äúan unprecedented overlap of human and machine nonsense,‚Äù a panel of 17 tenured professors in Critical Gender Studies failed to convince judges that they were, in fact, human.

The event occurred during a campus symposium on ‚ÄúAffective Algorithmic Desire Ecologies,‚Äù where organizers inserted both ChatGPT-generated abstracts and faculty papers into a blind Turing-style evaluation. Judges‚Äîcomposed of graduate students, administrators, and one very tired IT worker‚Äîwere asked to determine which texts came from people and which from machines.

‚ÄúThe professors consistently scored lower than the AI,‚Äù admitted Dr. Raymond Chao, head of the symposium. ‚ÄúOne participant even described herself as a ‚Äòcyborgian node of posthuman becoming‚Äô during live Q&A, at which point several judges marked her down as definitely synthetic.‚Äù

Students in attendance reported little surprise. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in seminars where the professor just reads words like ‚Äòproblematize,‚Äô ‚Äòliminality,‚Äô and ‚Äòepistemic performativity‚Äô for 90 minutes straight,‚Äù said one anonymous graduate student. ‚ÄúHonestly, a chatbot at least throws in examples.‚Äù

When asked for comment, one of the professors responded via email:

‚ÄúTo reduce this discursive collapse into a simplistic binary of ‚Äòhuman‚Äô and ‚Äòmachine‚Äô is itself a violent act of epistemic closure.‚Äù

The email was later confirmed to have been generated by an AI text simulator as a prank.

Administrators stressed that no faculty would lose their positions. ‚ÄúTenure protects both groundbreaking scholarship and indecipherable word salad,‚Äù said a spokesperson. ‚ÄúBesides, the AI doesn‚Äôt qualify for a pension.‚Äù

One parent of a freshman expressed unease:

‚ÄúIn saner times, individuals with this level of detachment from reality would have been cared for in quiet asylums, given grippy socks, and gently redirected to finger-painting workshops. To parade them on stage in front of students as if this is higher learning‚Äîit feels cruel. Almost exploitative.‚Äù

University administrators dismissed the criticism, saying the symposium was ‚Äúa vital pedagogical site for exploring the boundaries of coherence, confusion, and coffee stipends.",2,1761088425.0,grok,1,1.0,False

Oregon is more than just breathtaking landscapes and artisan coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs a dynamic, opportunity-rich state for entrepreneurs and marketers alike. Whether you're launching a new venture or scaling an established brand, understanding the unique marketing landscape in Oregon is key to thriving in this vibrant economy.

# The Pros of Marketing in Oregon

Oregon offers several advantages that make it a marketer‚Äôs dream:

* No Sales Tax: Oregon‚Äôs lack of a statewide sales tax means consumers pay less at checkout, which can boost spending and make promotional pricing more attractive.
* Legal Cannabis Marketing: Oregon allows recreational cannabis advertising, provided it follows strict guidelines‚Äîno targeting minors, no misleading claims, and no placement near schools or parks.
* Booming Tourism Sector: With over $12.3 billion in annual visitor spending, Oregon‚Äôs tourism industry is a goldmine for restaurants, outdoor outfitters, and hospitality businesses.
* Sports & Events Marketing: Organizations like Sport Oregon and the Southern Oregon Sports Commission help attract major events‚Äîfrom NCAA championships to Ironman races‚Äîcreating prime sponsorship and local marketing opportunities.
* Outdoor & Culinary Appeal: Oregon‚Äôs food trails, wineries, and adventure tourism offer rich storytelling angles for content marketing, influencer campaigns, and experiential branding.

# The Cons & Challenges

While Oregon is full of promise, there are a few hurdles to navigate:

* High Income Tax: Oregon compensates for its lack of sales tax with relatively high personal income tax rates, which can affect business margins.
* Local Restrictions: Cannabis marketing is legal, but cities and counties can opt out of allowing dispensaries or advertising, so hyper-local compliance is essential.
* Rural Reach: While urban centers like Portland and Eugene are marketing hotspots, rural areas may require more grassroots strategies and community engagement.

# Smart Marketing Strategies for Oregon Businesses

To succeed in Oregon‚Äôs unique environment, businesses should consider:

* Local SEO & Google Business Optimization: Especially important for restaurants, tour operators, and service providers.
* Geo-Targeted Ads: Use Oregon‚Äôs regional appeal to tailor campaigns for outdoor lovers, foodies, and eco-conscious consumers.
* Community Partnerships: Collaborate with local events, nonprofits, and tourism boards to boost visibility and credibility.
* Multi-Channel Automation: Platforms like GoHighLevel and WordPress integrations can streamline lead generation and customer nurturing.

Begging everyone to be careful of fraud.

From what I heard from friends working inside tastytrade, there is no way to prove that the account was hacked and IP addresses were the same as before. The OP kept trying to pressure tastytrade to refund but what most likely happen is her brother made a bad trade and lied to her or did not want to admit. She said her brother is someone who always had no clues. Her posts generated a lot of sympathetic likes from good people. But I want to say the claim is fishy. It has no evidence at all. 

I am not saying security is not important but when someone is urging you to think with emotions and sympathy, they likely don‚Äôt have strong evidence on its own else they won‚Äôt need emotional language. 

You don‚Äôt have to believe in what i said either, but this is honestly what I heard from tastytrade friends during coffee chat.

Any tips?,"TLDR: Vyvanse super helpful but giving me really bad anxiety. What are ways other people who are taking Vyvanse manage having bad anxiety as a side effect? (Not including getting back on antidepressants if I can avoid it) 

Disclaimer that I‚Äôm not using this post in replacement of consulting a medical professional. I‚Äôm waiting for my next doctors appointment next month and will properly consult with her about my concerns and possible avenues at that time. Just wanted to start thinking about options or things to implement into my routine in the meantime. 

Heyo! Long time lurker here but I just made this page to ask a quick question I‚Äôm hoping some may have answers to! 

I‚Äôve been on Vyvanse for almost a year now and it‚Äôs been insanely helpful for me in managing what I was prescribed it for (ADHD and BED) but it makes my anxiety so bad!!! I‚Äôve no doubt had consistent what I thought was bad anxiety for almost my whole life, but it‚Äôs been on a new level since taking Vyvanse. I get really bad physical anxiety now which I rarely experienced as a symptom of my anxiety prior to Vyvanse. It feels like increased heart rate, shaky hands, and a general uneasy feeling. It‚Äôs not constant or daily, but it‚Äôs definitely multiple times per week and it comes on so randomly. I‚Äôve cut out coffee and replaced it with teas and am working on fully cutting out nicotine. Those are 2 things that noticeably make it so much worse. But even on days where I don‚Äôt have either I notice it‚Äôll happen. 

I‚Äôm currently on 40mg but take 30mg on weekends cause my doctor recommended I do this to try and reduce the need to up my dosage as frequently (or hopefully not at all). I unfortunately can‚Äôt lower my dosage because any lower than what I‚Äôm at now causes the meds to stop working for me. 

I just wanted to see how others have been able to manage this side effect. I do not want to be put back onto antidepressants since I haven‚Äôt had great experiences with them in the past so I‚Äôm looking more so for things like habits, lifestyle changes, supplements, etc. Anything is appreciated, I‚Äôm just looking for some lived experiences to consider.

Also for some shameful context lol I don‚Äôt exercise aside from walking a few times a week and my sleeping and eating patterns have never been great - I was able to manage these poor lifestyle choices without suffering from physical anxiety prior to taking Vyvanse but perhaps these are important factors now?

1ocrzwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1ocrzwo/plan_to_move_forward_after_possibly_incorrect/,Plan to move forward after possibly incorrect Bipolar II with (correct) ADHD diagnosis,"Hello, would really appreciate your advice as I wrap my head around what to do next.
Details are below but the question is basically - is there a chance I‚Äôd have any luck for an alternative opinion/treatment or I am supposed to say goodbye to life-changing ADHD meds forever unless I go on mood stabilizers (supposedly hypomania induced by Buspirone) because one dude decided so? I don‚Äôt want to start ADHD diagnosis from scratch nor lie to a new psychiatrist about my experience with the treatment with this now former one. 

Details:
F30s, diagnosed with ADHD around 1,5 years ago. In therapy for 4 years. Once I learned about the mechanisms of the disorder (and not just external stereotypical parts) I have no doubt the diagnosis is correct. I‚Äôve been on methylphenidate for around the same time, my titrated dose has been around 40mg daily since over a year ago.
Decreased anxiety, more stable energy levels (only mood changes I‚Äôve experienced would be related and appropriate to specific life events), not spending all my energy to survive work meetings and, as a consequence, having mental energy for stable hobbies etc. 
Since last fall I‚Äôve experienced some anxiety, mostly physical, I take it as related to some unexpected life events and figuring out my marriage which has been a process for a long time.
Last fall I started Buspirone which was helpful although it was affecting sleep to some degree. It definitely helped with anticipation anxiety/control issues although some body anxiety still lingered which I connect to life events still.
Fast-forward to summer and  my psychiatrist says he thinks that I‚Äôm showing signs of hypomania and taking away all meds for a few weeks, I come back ‚Äúfine‚Äù and he gives me back my adhd meds and prescribes lamictal. He doesn‚Äôt even tell me that he (apparently) ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù me for Bipolar II. I bought it but wasn‚Äôt comfortable taking it in the end. Had the next visit and he says he will not prescribe me my adhd meds anymore because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnon-compliant‚Äù and he will not see me anymore.
I don‚Äôt have stigma about Bipolar and so on but I just really can‚Äôt relate to internal experiences people describe (dramatic relationships, risky behavior, substance abuse history) nor the external mania/depression markers. I felt like once he lutched on this idea he would just try to attach everything to it eventhough I‚Äôd answer no to all/most of his (apparently) criteria questions (if people noticed changes in me, if I have trouble managing money, if I get tired, etc). The visit where he thought I was hypomanic was right after a very intense (boot camp type) week I had with going straight to work barely awake and then having coffee super late which I never do so I was kind of jittery and I told him all that at the visit start. He is a (late I guess) resident still, in case that matters.
I don‚Äôt understand why I would have bipolar II triggered by meds only 8 months after  taking Buspirone and also having no issues while taking stimulants for longer.
I don‚Äôt think I had a hypomanic episode  but even if I supposedly did then it was medication-induced (Buspirone) and why would that indicate Bipolar II? That‚Äôs like saying if somebody reacts to too much coke  they have always been an addict and will always be.
I‚Äôve had life events influence me (a lot to process) but also amazing changes related to hobbies and community which changed my life and made me feel in peace (and excited).
I already feel trust issues after this whole experience and I am scared to go to a new doctor - this one provided a statement where he put adhd and Bipolar and that I ‚Äúrefused to take‚Äù mood stabilizers. Would my side of the story ever count or everybody would just take his word for it and I‚Äôm stuck with this forever?
I‚Äôve been functioning so well with my adhd meds - I‚Äôm able to live a balanced life - no adhd cyclical burnouts (overcommitment than crush ), no snacking out of boredom, being able to rest, seeing my priorities clearly and being able to handle a demanding (many meetings/unstructured tasks) job which I don‚Äôt think I will be able to without.
I feel misjudged and not sure what to do. 
of course I can start whole diagnosis fro scratch as if I had never taken any meds etc but I want to start with new dr from trust and not out of fear.",3,1761087900.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

1ocrxuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookair/comments/1ocrxuy/macbook_watercoffee_damage/,Macbook water/coffee damage,"So as you can read in the title my girlfriend managed to spill almost a whole cup of coffee in the morning on the keyboard, we fast wiped it down, turned it off and left it upside down because we didn‚Äôt have time to do anything else with it. Fast forward 6 hours, we got home and the laptop was turned on, keyboard doesn‚Äôt function, theres sound and the screen is fine, turned on on its own so i suppose the battery is fine.

Update
I made a video of the laptop, that it functions other than the keyboard. We took it to an apple store and we were told that it sucks but we can come back in 2 days when they have an appointment. Now 14 hours later the screen doesnt work and the laptop turns on and iff randomly. My problem with this that in the beginning it might would have been only a keyboard change but now, since apple refused to take care of it and told us to come back 2 days later when its quite obvious that by time the liquid gonna make even more damage and its gonna cost much more. Can apple responsible for any extra damage? Its Austria.
Within the support app we also booked an appointment to an apple certified service but when we get there they told us to come back tomorrow because their apple technician left.
Its extremely frustrating, I thought that theres hope saving it since it were functioning other than the keyboard but probably its gonna be more cost efficient to buy a new air at this point.

I was rewatching Two and a Half Men and noticed this red coffee bag on the kitchen counter next to the coffee machine (see image).

I‚Äôm really curious ‚Äî does anyone know what brand this is? It looks like a red bag with some white text/logo in the middle, and it seems to be a pretty common coffee brand.

Any guesses or confirmations would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",22,1761087615.0,TwoandaHalfMen,8,0.87,False
