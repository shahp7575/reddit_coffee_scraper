So hoping to connect with car guys of this sub on a driving date. I offer you to drive my xuv700 AX7 L Diesel Manual for 50+ kms, in return looking forward to drive your car (preferably virtus\\slavia 1.5 AT, Ignis AMT, Kylaq AT, Syros DCT) 50+ kms and share ownership experiences. Supervised drives, I sit on passenger seat when you drive mine, you take passenger seat when I drive yours.

  
I'll buy you coffee if you can change my mind that type of transmission (AMT vs CVT vs DCT vs DSG vs whatever) makes no difference in driving experience in a traffic Jam packed city like BLR.

  
P.S : I am not at all looking to sell my xuv. I had a polo DSG for city commute which I sold last weekend. Looking for it's replacement to use within city.",1,1750781557.0,CarsIndia,1,1.0,False
1ljfacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAdvertising/comments/1ljfacy/set_up_the_budget_on_your_ads_how/,"Set up the budget on your ads, how?","Imagine we are trying to sell a coffee trough Meta Ads, so we if we as a business sell de cup of coffee for 3 USD, we need to know how much the business take for all the cost and how much is to everything on the side of preparing the coffee, like buy the coffee, purchase also water, mugs or cups, whatever...

So after we have everything summarize, imagine we have a profit of 1 USD.

So the business take 2 USD to make the coffee and put the coffee in the client hands; however, we are going to add another cost on this, MKT...

If we use basic math, to have another 10 USD on profit we need to sell 10 more, 10 times 10. Mkt, is just going to increase the sales \*YOU ALREADY HAVE\*, I wont recommend if you are a trafficker, TEST products or offers (if its your business, you have no option) that are not yours. You will have the accountability of the results and also for the whole business.

Let¬¥s continue with the math, so, if you want to sell 10 coffee, there is a metric called CAC, that means how much we are going to pay for a client, so we are going to take that cost, from the profit that one coffee generates from a sale, so we have 1 USD to use, obviously we have to set up a range, bc we cannot give al our profit to Meta, lets say we are going to set a maximum of 0.1 USD.

If we want to get 10 more clientes per month, we need to invest 1 USD on Mkt. Why? If each cliente cost 0.1 USD, and we need to get 10 more, how much we need to invest on Mkt? 1 USD.

As simple as that, with this process on mind all of your ads have a north on ur strategy. BE PROFITABLE  is the goal.",1,1750781535.0,FacebookAdvertising,0,1.0,False

1ljf8jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ljf8jz/i_think_my_roommates_bandmate_might_like_me/,I think my roommates bandmate might like me?,"Do we think he likes me? (long post, sorry!)

Hi everyone! Over the past month, I‚Äôve been getting closer with my roommate‚Äôs bandmate, and I think he might like me, but I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just overthinking or if something real is happening.

It started a month ago when I moved into my new place early for a summer internship. I was the first to move in and needed help picking up some secondhand furniture, but my license had expired and I hadn‚Äôt renewed it yet. My roommate and close friend (let‚Äôs call her Nina) said her band‚Äôs guitarist, Lucas, might be willing to help since he lives near our college town. Our hometown is about three hours away. We‚Äôd met before but weren‚Äôt close.

To my surprise, he agreed to help. During the hour-long U-Haul drive, we ended up talking a lot. I‚Äôm pretty extroverted and he‚Äôs more on the quiet side, but we found we had a lot in common and conversation flowed easily.

A few days later, I invited him, Nina, and another friend (Jackson) over for dinner as a thank you. We all got a little drunk and played Truth or Drink. At one point, Lucas asked Jackson how to get closer to a girl you just met and think is really cool, because apparently he‚Äôs usually the one getting flirted with, not the one doing the flirting. Jackson gave his answer, and I chimed in to say that from a girl‚Äôs perspective, asking her to hang out one-on-one is a good way to go. Coffee, thrifting, record stores, bookstores, that kind of thing. Then see how she reacts. Lucas nodded and the conversation moved on.

A couple days later we were both invited to a house show by mutual friends. Even though Lucas had to help with setup, he stayed by me the whole night. After the show, some people invited us to an after-party, but Lucas asked me if I wanted to skip it and go to Taco Bell instead. We ended up there, talking for hours. Eventually we went to the university radio station, where we both DJ. We were hanging out in the cramped CD room, and there were a few moments where our fingers brushed and we were really close. I thought he was about to kiss me, but a few other DJs came in at that exact moment. He barely talked to anyone else the rest of the night and kept his attention on me. He drove me home, but since nothing happened I started to convince myself I imagined the tension.

A few days later, he texted me and asked if I wanted to go to the record store after his shift. I said yes. Since his birthday was coming up, I told him I‚Äôd buy him any record under $30. We had a great time again, full of easy conversation and those ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù touches. He picked a record, and I found one I liked too, but I put it back because I didn‚Äôt want to go over budget. After I bought his gift, he turned around and bought the record I had been eyeing. Later, he came over while I made Indian food. He helped with chores, even did my dishes, and we ended up talking for hours. But again, he didn‚Äôt make a move.

Just yesterday, I had a day off and we went thrifting together. He took me to his favorite barbecue spot because he remembered I recently started eating pork and hadn‚Äôt had good barbecue yet. He also asked me to help decorate his office at the radio station. While we were decorating, he even taught me how to Cha Cha because there was Ranchera music playing in the studio. It felt really intimate.

All of this sounds romantic, I know, and I probably sound a little silly for questioning it. But after my last relationship, my confidence is not great. Also, Lucas isn‚Äôt really a big texter. He only texts to make plans. I feel like, especially with how our generation works, if someone likes you they‚Äôd be texting more regularly?

So Reddit, does he like me?
All names are fake. I don‚Äôt usually post here, but my friends encouraged me to do it because I need an outside opinion. I want to think they‚Äôre not just hyping me up, but I‚Äôm asking because I want to be sure I‚Äôm not imagining things.",1,1750781424.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1ljf6pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_shahla_naz/comments/1ljf6pw/why_are_vintage_fast_food_ads_becoming_hot/,Why Are Vintage Fast Food Ads Becoming Hot Collector Items?,"In the ever-evolving world of collectibles, few trends have captured attention quite like the rise of **vintage fast food** [**advertising memorabilia**](https://www.truegether.com/category/collectibles). What was once overlooked as disposable marketing is now being re-evaluated through the lens of nostalgia, pop culture history, and rare value. From quirky mascots and neon signs to paper trays and burger wrappers, fast food advertising is fast becoming one of the most sought-after categories in the collectibles market.

https://preview.redd.it/7bpcspo1gw8f1.jpg?width=5943&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=848cc3db070771f91d994526990cf965d0bcd36e

**The Nostalgia Factor**

The surge in demand for vintage fast food ads can largely be attributed to the powerful emotional pull of **nostalgia**. As millennials and Gen Xers enter their peak earning years, many are revisiting the icons of their childhood. Items like McDonald‚Äôs Happy Meal toys, Taco Bell Chihuahua ads, or vintage Burger King crowns evoke memories of simpler times and family outings.

According to a 2023 report by eBay, searches for ""vintage fast food collectibles"" rose by **42% year-over-year**, with McDonald‚Äôs-related items making up the majority of those queries. The fast food industry has always been deeply embedded in American culture, making these items emotional artifacts as much as they are historical ones.

**Rarity and Limited Editions**

Vintage fast food advertising pieces were never designed to last. Items like limited-run cups, promotional posters, tray liners, or menu boards were often discarded after a campaign ended. This makes surviving examples increasingly rare, especially in good condition.

A recent example: a full set of 1980s McDonald‚Äôs Halloween pails fetched over **$400** on an online auction site, despite originally being given away for free. Collectors understand that scarcity, paired with cultural relevance, creates strong demand.

Moreover, short-term promotions linked to pop culture events (such as Star Wars or Disney tie-ins) are even more valuable. A sealed 1996 Space Jam Happy Meal set sold for over **$1,000** in 2022.

**Design & Branding Appeal**

Fast food advertising in the 1970s through early 2000s was known for its **bold colors**, **whimsical mascots**, and distinctive typography. These design elements have become iconic in their own right. Today‚Äôs graphic designers and branding enthusiasts collect these ads as inspiration and cultural reference.

For instance, the original Ronald McDonald costume designs or the early print ads for Wendy‚Äôs ""Where‚Äôs the Beef?"" campaign are not only nostalgic but have significant branding value. They represent how marketing evolved, especially in appealing to children and families.

**Pop Culture Resurgence**

The resurgence of Y2K aesthetics and retro 90s culture across platforms like TikTok and Instagram has driven renewed interest in fast food collectibles. Gen Z, although not raised during the original campaigns, finds the retro aesthetic ""cool"" and ironic. Vintage Arby‚Äôs neon signs or Pizza Hut red plastic cups have become fixtures in themed home decor and social content.

Hashtags like #vintagefastfood and #retroadvertising have garnered **millions of views** online, fueling viral content and unboxing videos. In many ways, these platforms are redefining how collectibles are shared, discovered, and valued.

**Investment Potential**

While the emotional and aesthetic value is clear, many collectors are turning to fast food memorabilia as a legitimate investment. Just like vintage comic books or vinyl records, the market is maturing. Auction houses and online marketplaces are now listing vintage fast food items as dedicated categories.

The investment appeal lies in the high return potential. For instance:

* A 1973 Burger King ""Whopper Whistle"" was recently sold for **$275**.
* A complete set of 1980s Taco Bell lapel pins fetched **$600**.
* Even rare KFC memorabilia from the 60s and 70s has been valued in the **$1,000+** range, especially if tied to Colonel Sanders' legacy.

Collectors are no longer just hobbyists; many are entering the market with a keen eye for value appreciation and resale potential.

**Cultural Significance**

Fast food brands have not just sold meals; they‚Äôve sold **moments, lifestyles, and memories**. The advertising campaigns that drove their growth also shaped consumer behavior, childhood memories, and societal trends.

From slogans like ""Have It Your Way"" to campaigns like ""I‚Äôm Lovin‚Äô It,"" the cultural footprint of these brands is immense. Collecting their vintage ads is, in some ways, preserving a slice of American pop history.

Fast food memorabilia has even found its way into museums. The Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., holds several artifacts from McDonald's and KFC, emphasizing their relevance in the cultural narrative.

**Tips for New Collectors**

If you‚Äôre new to the space and looking to get started with collecting vintage fast food ads and memorabilia, here are a few tips:

1.¬†¬†¬† **Start Small**: Look for common items like tray liners, paper bags, or ad flyers on platforms like eBay or TrueGether.

2.¬†¬†¬† **Check Condition**: Original colors, minimal creases, and no stains can greatly affect value.

3.¬†¬†¬† **Do Your Research**: Learn about campaign dates and rare releases. Tie-ins with movies or events tend to fetch higher prices.

4.¬†¬†¬† **Join Communities**: Online forums, Reddit groups, and Facebook marketplaces are treasure troves of information and deals.

5.¬†¬†¬† **Stay Authentic**: Reproductions exist, so always verify age and authenticity before purchasing.

**Final Thoughts**

The rise of vintage fast food advertising collectibles isn't just a quirky fad; it's a reflection of broader cultural trends in nostalgia, design appreciation, and alternative investments. With rarity on its side and emotional connection fueling demand, the market shows no signs of cooling off.

Whether you collect for the memories or the money, one thing is certain: vintage fast food ads have earned their place in the collectible spotlight.

1ljf0s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1ljf0s4/the_7_paths/,The 7 Paths,"Around 6 or 7 months ago, I started isolating myself from everyone.

I didn‚Äôt plan it that way. I just slowly stopped answering texts. I drifted from my friends, stayed inside most days, and let the world move on without me. But I didn‚Äôt feel sad about it not at first. I just felt numb. Like life had lost color, and all I could do was go through the motions.

Back then, my only comfort was this small routine I developed: I‚Äôd buy a cup of coffee, roll a joint, and walk to a secluded spot in the woods not too far from where I live. It wasn‚Äôt anything special a clearing near the woods with a half-burnt log I used as a seat. but it became my sanctuary. I‚Äôd sit there for hours. Sometimes I‚Äôd practice throwing my knife into a tree, other times I‚Äôd light a small fire and just sit there in silence, drinking coffee, smoking, watching the sun go down behind the trees.

It was peaceful. But also‚Ä¶ empty.

Until one evening, everything changed.

That day, I had stayed out longer than usual almost four hours and I started feeling this strange pressure in the air. Like something unseen was brushing against the edges of my awareness. I couldn‚Äôt explain it. I looked around constantly. Checked behind me. Scanned the woods. I‚Äôm the type to stay on high alert every crack of a branch, every rustle, I notice. But there was nothing. No person, no animal. Just that feeling of being watched.

Still, I brushed it off.

Once the sun disappeared and dusk started creeping in, I packed up and left. I didn‚Äôt want my family to worry since I had been gone for so long. I walked the same trail I always took. But when I crossed the road out of the woods and stepped onto the path that leads home, I heard something behind me crunching leaves, snapping sticks, heavy steps.

I turned around.
Nothing.

I stood there, heart pounding. The hairs on my arms stood up. Every instinct in my body told me something was there. But again‚Ä¶ nothing.

I kept walking.

Moments later, up ahead on the path, I saw a shadow. At first, I thought it was a trick of the trees the way the moonlight hit the branches but then I realized it was standing. Not moving. Arms wide open.

It was massive. Taller than anything I‚Äôve seen before. broad, motionless. Just blackness shaped like a man no details, no face, just void. But the weirdest part? I had never seen that shadow before, and I walked that path every single day.

Something in me hesitated.
Should I turn around? Take a different path?

But something deeper whispered: No. Go forward.

So I took a deep breath‚Ä¶ and walked straight toward it.

The moment I touched the shadow, my body locked up. I didn‚Äôt fall, but it was like time froze not around me, but inside me. Then a vision slammed into my mind. I didn‚Äôt see it with my eyes, but with something deeper.

I saw a giant being almost human, but not. It was made entirely of black flame, and its eyes were pure yellow fire, staring through me like they knew every part of my soul. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. My spine turned to ice. I stood there, silent, stunned, thinking,
‚ÄúIf I die here‚Ä¶ so be it.‚Äù

But I didn‚Äôt die.
I walked forward.
And I made it home.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.
And 7 days later, I had the dream.

But it wasn‚Äôt a dream, it was more like a memory of something I hadn‚Äôt lived yet.

The flame-being returned. And this time, it spoke.

It didn‚Äôt tell me its name. But it said, ‚ÄúI am a gift.‚Äù
Then it told me this:

‚ÄúYou will walk through 7 Paths.
Each one will burn away a part of who you are.
You will suffer. You will lose your identity.
There will be pain, horror, and shifts in your soul.
And you will die 
and be reborn as what you were always meant to become.‚Äù

Then it asked me:
‚ÄúAre you ready for the life you say you want?‚Äù

And I said: ‚ÄúYes. I am.‚Äù

Since then, my life hasn‚Äôt been the same.

I‚Äôve had visions during meditation some peaceful, some terrifying. But during one of them, I met five figures in my mind. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but I knew them. Not by name, but by presence. We spoke without words. And slowly, I began to understand‚Ä¶

They were The Paths the being had spoken of.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned so far:

1st Path: Gore ‚Äì The Path of Hate. A red-eyed being made of raw rage. He showed me what I‚Äôve suppressed: my anger, my wounds, my desire to destroy.
2nd Path: Pain ‚Äì The Path of Suffering and Redemption. He made me relive the moments that broke me ‚Äî and asked me what I learned from them.
3rd Path: Mr. K ‚Äì The Duality between Light and Darkness. He‚Äôs calm but unpredictable my shadow and my guide. He asks questions I don‚Äôt want to answer.
4th Path: Yuboku ‚Äì The Path of Desire. Seductive, deep, magnetic. He reflects the things I crave, but also the illusions I cling to.
5th Path: Little J ‚Äì The Path of Innocence. He‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ as a child. Pure, unguarded. He makes me remember who I was before the world changed me.

I believe the shadow being is the 6th Path ‚Äì Death, the guide through the threshold.
And that I am the 7th Path ‚Äì Life.
But I‚Äôm still piecing it together.

This is just the beginning.
There‚Äôs more to tell more visions, more challenges. But I‚Äôll share it in parts. I don‚Äôt know if this is a spiritual awakening, a test, or something entirely beyond language.

If any of this resonates with you if you‚Äôve seen similar things, heard similar voices, met beings in meditation I‚Äôd love to hear your story.

I don‚Äôt know where this path is leading me, but I know I‚Äôm walking it ",1,1750780936.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False

1ljezqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetYourGeekSideshow/comments/1ljezqh/the_artists_behind_the_artwork_of_star_wars/,The Artists Behind the Artwork of Star Wars,"Art is so important to fandom. It pulls scenes from the screen straight to our home galleries or portfolios. It reimagines characters in new costumes or with different companions, or dazzles us with [**behind-the-scenes looks at designs that were either altered or never fully realized**](https://www.sideshow.com/blog/scariest-star-wars-characters). From traditional ink and pen to digital compositions, this official art has a vital place in how we honor the things we geek out over.

Concept art, then, is crucial for the fans. But it‚Äôs also important for the stories as they‚Äôre being told. [***Star Wars*****‚Ñ¢**](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/star-wars), for instance, like many other movies, started with an idea. Then a script. And then artists took those visions and words and turned them into the heroes, villains, and creatures we see on film today.

To celebrate these concepts, we‚Äôre looking at the past and present of [***Star Wars*** **art**](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/star-wars/type/art-print). We‚Äôll start with the who¬† ‚Äî as in, who did the artwork for *Star Wars?*

# Ralph McQuarrie Created Iconic Star Wars Concept Art

https://preview.redd.it/68va5p1o6n8f1.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=541d10d58b994714d2b87291590c83dc0331fd81

Of course, when we think about original *Star Wars* art, we tend to recall the name Ralph McQuarrie first. Specifically, McQuarrie‚Äôs hand-painted matte production artwork. This futurist created sweeping scenery and captured the details and emotions of every *Star Wars* character. He envisioned dramatic designs and innovative concepts for costuming, storyboards, and key worldbuilding illustrations for the original trilogy.

His figure designs for [**Darth Vader**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/darth-vader), [**Han Solo**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/han-solo), [**Chewbacca**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/chewbacca), Starkiller ‚Äî a precursor to [**Luke Skywalker**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/luke-skywalker) ‚Äî and the Imperial [**stormtroopers**](https://www.sideshow.com/affiliations/stormtroopers) are particularly famous. While his angular art couldn‚Äôt be made 1-to-1 in the movies, it‚Äôs had a lasting impact. After all, it looks great animated ‚Äî especially in *Star Wars:* *Rebels*‚Ñ¢. Additionally, McQuarrie‚Äôs first draft of a Wookiee was eschewed in final filming, but later became the design for the Lasat species, of which Garazeb Orrelios is a member.

Inspired by his iconic designs, Sideshow once did a series of statues based on his concepts for [**Boba Fett**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/boba-fett), Darth Vader, and the stormtrooper. Though they are long sold out, his influence continues to capture the imaginations of fans and artists to this day. McQuarrie‚Äôs designs were even used as the basis for [***Star Wars*** **action figures**](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/star-wars/type/all-figures) from various manufacturers over the years.

https://preview.redd.it/m8pc2qky6n8f1.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=492ded3a4f2296e0814fb3bbd716328859e8361d

Returning to *Rebels*, the planet Lothal‚Ñ¢ was also based on McQuarrie‚Äôs work and the character Azmorigan‚Ñ¢ in the show takes inspiration from early [**Jabba the Hutt‚Ñ¢**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/jabba-the-hutt) designs. Basically *Rebels* was a total return to his style and concepts. Beyond his significant artistic contributions to the *Star Wars* universe, McQuarrie also created concept illustrations for the [***Indiana Jones***](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/indiana-jones) franchise.

# Drew Struzan Did the Famous Star Wars Posters

https://preview.redd.it/tk5ylnhz6n8f1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c503110d061c403133e09952c6e6ccbdf8cc8c96

Drew Struzan, alongside his friend Charles White III, was first commissioned to paint [***Star Wars*** **art**](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/star-wars/type/art-print) back in 1977. Together they painted a 1978 poster for the *Star Wars: A New Hope*‚Ñ¢ theatrical re-release. The poster‚Äôs heightened realism style wowed audiences with rich hues and a vibrant character collage. It conveyed the adventure and excitement of the cinematic stories in two-dimensional spreads. Of course, the posters took off in popularity, adorning the wall space of *Star Wars* fans everywhere.

Struzan went on to create more [**fantasy**](https://www.sideshow.com/genres/fantasy/type/art-print) and [**sci-fi artwork**](https://www.sideshow.com/genres/sci-fi/type/art-print) for Lucasfilm and many other film companies on his own. Not only did he contribute to further designs in the *Star Wars* saga, but he worked on *Indiana Jones*, [***Back to the Future***](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/back-to-the-future), [***Harry Potter***](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/harry-potter), and more. You‚Äôll see Struzan‚Äôs lush, colorful oil paint work on posters far and wide. The style has been imitated countless times, all with the intent to pay homage to the original creator and his beloved artwork.

# ¬†The Mandalorian Art ‚Äî End Credits and Concepts

https://preview.redd.it/8r2txz907n8f1.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f93c8a9601a2707e0b9b0f8b37dc092778db0b94

*Star Wars* concept artwork didn‚Äôt stop at the original trilogy, of course. Countless highly skilled and amazingly talented artists have contributed to storyboards, concept art, and coffee table books over the years. Even in later series such as *The Mandalorian*‚Ñ¢, artwork serves to further ignite audience‚Äôs imaginations with each story.

During every episode‚Äôs end credits, stunning art expands on the episode‚Äôs action. Fans get to see how their favorite moments in the series were drafted and imagined before being translated into live action, puppetry, and additional scenic design. We owe that magical journey to artists Ryan Church, Nick Gindraux, Brian Matyas, and Christian Alzmann. [***The Mandalorian***¬†**art**](https://www.sideshow.com/characters/the-mandalorian/type/art-print)¬†brings the visual side of the critically acclaimed live-action series to, well, life. Fans can see these breathtaking images and feel like they‚Äôre part of the show itself, gaining even more insight into their favorite scenes and showdowns.

As Phil Szostak, author of *The Art of the Mandalorian* points out, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very symbiotic relationship between writing and art. *Star Wars* visuals are not like anything in our world. And so these artists really inject life into the story in a way that the writer would struggle to do alone.‚Äù From the opening crawls to the end titles, the credits from a galaxy far, far away are out of this world! Art holds an important place in *Star Wars* storytelling at nearly every turn.

Were you aware of who does the *Star Wars* artwork before now? These concepts and designs help bring all the ideas to action-packed life in theaters and on streaming platforms, so it‚Äôs important to recognize the creators!",1,1750780873.0,LetYourGeekSideshow,0,1.0,False

About Me:
I'm a good friend to be with because I'm more of a listener. I'm pretty adaptable to different friend groups and can find the good in certain things and appreciate them. I love learning about different things and expanding my world view.

I love movies and tv shows a lot. Been watching movies at the cineplex once or twice a week. For shows my preferences are all over the place haha. Recently I watched SAS Rogue Heroes about the history of the SAS and was nice because I saw the villain from Sinners was in it. Last movie I watched was 28 Years Later. Quite an interesting ending haha

I used to like anime a lot. Not that I hate it now but I just haven't watched anything lately so Im open to referrals.

For music I'm also all over the place. I like Sleep Token recently and I also found a band called Nightlife and they describe themselves as Baltimore Soulpunk. A really fun band. 


We can go to coffee shops or other fun events around the city. I just don't like the heat a lot even though I was born and raised from a tropical asian country. One of the reasons I moved here was because of the colder weather. The summer just reminds me of back home. Bonus points who can guess lol.

But yeah that's me. Just a friendly guy in his early 30s who is looking for friends to hang out with and navigate adulthood in these stressful times.",2,1750780869.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,1.0,False
1ljewfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ljewfy/never_look_a_celebrity_in_the_eyes_ever/,Never look a celebrity in the eyes. Ever.,"Ever since I was a little girl, I‚Äôd always wanted to be an actress. Today, I‚Äôve decided to quit.

I grew up in Kansas, so Hollywood was quite literally my ‚ÄúEmerald City‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm 26, and would do anything to tell my 16-year-old self to dream up some other fantasy. And no, before you say ‚ÄúWell, what did you think? That it‚Äôd be a cakewalk?‚Äù, let me tell you‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not because it was hard. Nope. In fact, I was a pretty natural talent. I was landing decent-sized parts in bigger productions. I even had a couple of leads in some indies you may have heard of if you're a film festival nut.¬†

I quit because of one job. Yup, one.

It was last Winter. Things always slow down during the winter. Days are shorter, which means less natural sunlight, which means more compact shooting schedules, which means more shooting days, which means spending more money. So most studios would rather wait for the Summer to roll back around. And this Winter‚Äôs days were especially short. Some days, the sun was already down before 4:00PM. I‚Äôve never witnessed anything like it.

But, by this point in my career, I had an agent. A good one too. So generally he could still keep me busy with odds and ends. One gig that always got floated my way was that of a ‚ÄúGrocery-Store Customer‚Äù. At first glance you‚Äôd think it was some simple background role, and in many ways it was, but this particular opportunity paid very well, resulted in very consistent & steady work, and was fronted by an extremely high profile talent.

I never really cared to be a part of it‚Ä¶ until I was rejected by their casting department‚Ä¶ *three times in a row*. What could I possibly not have as an actor that the others did to simply play a ‚Äòbackground shopper‚Äô? I was pretty confident I was attractive enough (which I had quickly learned was a hurdle for many of my peers. )

Simply, my agent would say, ‚Äúthey‚Äôd like to see some more experience under your belt.‚Äù

Whatever, where was a gig like that going to get me anyways?¬†

But it irked me.

Then, this past January, a call for my agent:

‚ÄúHey, the ‚ÄúGrocery-Store‚Äù gig. They want you.‚Äù

I hated that I was excited.

I‚Äôll never forget my first day on set. 7:30AM, still dark as midnight, a Ralphs grocery store.

I saw a white tent near the front and some middle aged folks rapping over their walkies with coffees in hand. Some other groggy people walked that way, so I followed suit. As I poured myself a cup at the crafty table, a younger man stood next to me looking over the plastic wrapped baked goods. He was familiar.¬†

‚ÄúDo I know you? I‚Äôm Molly.‚Äù

I asked.

‚ÄúOh hey, I don‚Äôt think so. This is your first day?‚Äù

‚ÄúYah‚Ä¶ hey were you in *Daffodils were Burning* ?‚Äù

He looked down shyly.

‚ÄúYah actually, thanks for checking it out. I‚Äôm Dimitri.‚Äù

*Checking it out?* That movie was in every major theater chain last year. What the fuck was he doing here?¬†

‚ÄúDimitri‚Ä¶ nice to meet you. Hey- could you tell me a little bit more about what we‚Äôre doing here? I feel so in the dark right now.‚Äù

He winced, as though I had asked him to help me load a U-Haul.

He explained that we were here to serve the fantasy of an immensely famous (and wealthy) individual.

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable saying who the person is, but it wouldn‚Äôt be outlandish to say they are one of most well-known, universally beloved, artists of all time. I know it sounds ridiculous. But bear with me, this is just the tip of the iceberg. I‚Äôll just refer to the person as ‚Äú**Bob**‚Äù for the sake of the story.

Dimitri looked about cautiously and quietly explained. **Bob** had apparently become so famous, it became impossible for them to live a normal life. They began to yearn for normality so much that they started doing this. Creating manufactured environments with actors. Actors who were trained to treat them normally. To not lose their shit when they entered the room.¬†

The Assistant Director, Frank, came in with a tight white button up that made his gut protrude like a half moon. He motioned for everyone to take a seat in the row of white folding chairs before him. He took a big swig of his morning coffee, further staining his already yellow teeth.

‚ÄúAlright! I see one‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ three new faces! Welcome. I‚Äôll keep it brief since most of you already know the drill.‚Äù

I looked around trying to identify who the ‚Äònew faces‚Äô could be, but it was impossible to tell in the sea of faces. There were at least a hundred of us.

‚ÄúRule Number 1: Your motivation is that of a shopper. You treat this grocery store like your own. Look for the things you would look for. If you finish early, think of a new recipe you‚Äôd like to try. You get the idea.‚Äù

Someone two rows in front of me was taking notes. A stocky bald man.

‚ÄúRule Number 2: If **Bob** approaches you to make small talk, you must speak to them as though they are a total stranger. You can be rude, you can be kind, but you can not act as though you know them.‚Äù

Already I felt uncomfortable. I was a pro, but I was already feeling unnaturally nervous. What would I say if **Bob** approached me?

‚ÄúRule Number 3: Everyone say it with me‚Ä¶!‚Äù

Everyone around me joined together in a harmony of drab

*‚ÄúAbsolutely, positively, no eye contact.‚Äù*

What the fuck?! I mean, I‚Äôd heard of celebrities pulling shit like this‚Ä¶ but this person, I‚Äôd always thought of them as so humble and down to earth? I mean‚Ä¶ solely based on podcast appearances and talk shows, of course.

The stocky bald man raised his hand. But Frank pretended to not notice.

‚Äú5 minutes everyone! Then collect your production money, grab your cart and get shopping!‚Äù

We all lined up in front of a white plastic table. A production assistant sullenly handed out $200 in 20s to each of us for us to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô groceries with. It appeared to be real money as far as I could tell. There was a fragility to this operation that I could feel as I walked around ‚Äòset‚Äô. It felt as though if even one person stepped out of line, or pulled a stunt, that any and all of this could come crumbling down. I was beginning to understand why there had seemingly been so many hoops for me to jump through to get here now.

9:00AM sharp. We all begin ‚Äòshopping‚Äô. Believe it or not, I actually had prepared a little grocery list the night before. Just an actor‚Äôs tick I guess. I began to go down the list, really taking my time with each item. Looking around at the others, it really just looked like a bunch of other customers at a grocery store. It wasn‚Äôt hard to get lost in the illusion of it at all. Then it really dawned on me how nuanced some of their performances were. The way one performer would accidentally knock a can off a shelf. The way another would round a corner and take a bite of a fruit they had no intention of purchasing. It had all the funny details of real life. Not to mention an entire other cast of people working the jobs. A register, butcher, baker. All seemingly carrying out the actual duties of each department. Just as I was getting lost in the fantasy of it all, the atmosphere shifted.

In through the sliding glass doors came **Bob**.

They looked older than I thought they would. But then again, this was a celebrity, rarely seen in public, but often on the covers of magazines and red carpets. None of the glitz and glamor was here. I realized then that I had been staring, and went right back to shopping.¬†

I sort of kept **Bob** in the corner of my eye, and tried to navigate the store in a way where I wouldn‚Äôt have to run into them. Eventually I lost track of them, and decided to camp out by the avocados and find the very best one. I took a long time meditatively squeezing each one. I‚Äôm not sure how much time passed by, but eventually, a voice startled me from behind.

‚ÄúAny keepers?‚Äù

I spun around to see **Bob** was standing right in front of me.

I was star-struck, but remembered to not look into their eyes just in the knick of time.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ yah‚Ä¶ a few good ones.‚Äù

I sputtered.

‚ÄúWell leave a couple for the rest of us, eh?!‚Äù¬†

That charisma. I‚Äôd heard it on talk-shows and interviews for so many years. It was exactly the same. But in real-life, it felt so manufactured and foreign in the normality of a Ralphs.¬†

‚ÄúOh of course. Here, these ones should do‚Äù

**Bob** took the avocados into their basket.

‚ÄúThanks dear! Say, you new to the neighborhood? I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve seen you around before?‚Äù

In the corner of my eye, I noticed one of the ‚Äòstaff members‚Äô at the cash register was grumbling quickly into a walkie talkie. I quickly started to move, pushing my cart in the other direction.

‚ÄúOh, haha yea! Just moved around the bend here. See ya around!‚Äù

As I gave **Bob** a little wave, I thought for maybe just a moment, through the slits in my fingers, we made eye contact. But‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt really be sure‚Ä¶ so how could anyone else?

I shopped mostly in peace for another hour or so; **Bob** checked out about 20 minutes before me. Once I checked out and returned to the parking lot, Frank approached me with a coffee stained envelope. ‚ÄúSee ya Monday, week after next?‚Äù He asked chipperly. ‚ÄúYeah. See ya then.‚Äù

When I got home, I kept running through everything I had seen that day. It was all so strange, yet I had nothing to really grasp as to convince myself that anything was out of the ordinary. Of course, the whole thing was weird, but the oddity of being that famous almost warranted solutions as bizarre as this. No‚Ä¶ it was something else. The way Dimitri spoke to me. The way everyone treated that third rule like religion‚Ä¶ and **Bob‚Ä¶**

Whatever, the money was good. Really good. And it was the slow season. Plus, to be working alongside people like Dimitri could lead to more exciting opportunities later.

Two weeks later. 7:30AM, Ralphs.¬†

We sat under the big white tent once again. However, I noticed the stocky man from before was missing. I never even learnt his name. Dimitri sat next to me.

‚ÄúHey Molly. How goes it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh hey! Good, good.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard you had a scene with **Bob** yesterday? That‚Äôs cool! Still yet to chat me up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh really? Haha, ya‚Ä¶ it was nice‚Ä¶ seems like a nice dude.‚Äù

Dimitri forced a grin.

‚ÄúOh yah, nicest guy!‚Äù

I looked back to the empty seat where the stocky man once sat.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ do you happen to know what happened to the other new guy? Baldy?‚Äù

Dimitri suddenly looked nervous.

‚ÄúOh, no I didn‚Äôt realize he was gone‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dimitri did a 360 around the room.

‚ÄúYa, damn, sucks to fuck up that early on.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think they fired him?‚Äù

‚ÄúYa‚Ä¶ he probably looked.‚Äù

Damn. I was so close.

Frank entered the room in the same white button up, stained coffee drips tattooed onto the side of his used paper cup.

‚ÄúChop chop! Let‚Äôs go, everyone!‚Äù

Everyone got to work shopping. Ten minutes went by. Thirty. Then an hour. Then two. No **Bob**.

I was just about running out of items on my extensive faux shopping list when suddenly Frank‚Äôs voice crackled to life over the intercom.

‚ÄúEveryone go home. **Bob** took an impromptu trip with his *new friend*. Won‚Äôt be coming in.‚Äù

Everyone immediately abandoned their shopping cart, swiftly collapsing the illusion that had been in perpetual motion the past two hours.

We all walked outside, collected our money and went home.

That night I cracked a beer and turned on the TV Set. Lo and behold, there was **Bob** on a rerun of the Tonight Show, cracking up over some personal anecdote from their extravagant life. Except, watching them now, I felt no envy. Ever since I was a little girl in Kansas, all I wanted was to be on that screen, laughing with a white man in a suit. But even getting a little taste of the top this month, it felt gross. It felt hollow, and‚Ä¶ inhuman.

As I sat on my armchair, nursing my third beer of the night, I slowly began to fade into slumber. However, just as I could, my phone began to hum on the coffee table. Its buzz slowly pulled me back into consciousness.

I wish with all my being that I would've just fallen back asleep that night.

Frank‚Äôs voice came through, scratchy and heavy. I could almost smell his festering mouth just in his words. He was panicking. Explained that **Bob** has decided to do a late night snack run, and they needed actors asap. Double the rate for those who could make it.

Granted I should have said no, I was pretty out of it, but I couldn‚Äôt say no to double the cash. He promised it‚Äôd only be an hour tops. So I changed, splashed some water in my face, called an Uber, and made my way there.

Upon arriving, there was no white tent, no crafty or morning coffee. Frank and a couple other department leaders seemed to have just arrived as well. They ushered me inside quickly with a small handful of others desperate enough to take the call.

It was only about five minutes after I began my shopping that **Bob** arrived. They looked horrible.

They had tear stained eyes and quickly shuffled their way towards the frozen aisle.

In my still half-drunken state, a wash of sympathy rushed over me in that moment. I felt bad for **Bob**. What a miserable life it must be, to organize all of this- just to feel normal? It must be eating them away inside.¬†

I meandered my way over to the frozen aisle too. **Bob** was shuffling through pints of Ben & Jerry‚Äôs Ice Cream. Maybe they weren‚Äôt so different from everyone else after all. I wanted to go and say something, but would I get fired? I didn‚Äôt get it. It seemed to me that someone like **Bob** would want the connection of another person. Why would I get fired for looking them in the eye?¬†

My intoxicated state decided I didn‚Äôt care if I got fired anymore, and that I wanted to help this person. I stumbled over to **Bob**, who was wiping away fresh tears.

‚ÄúHey there‚Ä¶ *Avocado guy*‚Ä¶ you alright?‚Äù

**Bob** looked me in the eyes. They were like spiraling pools of shimmering ocean water. So beautiful, so organically spectacular. Even in my drunken state I could appreciate just how striking their eyes were in person. **Bob** cracked a smile.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ hey. Avocado lady. Thanks. But no, I‚Äôm not alright. It's‚Ä¶ been a rough day.‚Äù

I pointed to the Ben & Jerry‚Äôs tub in **Bob‚Äôs** hand.

‚ÄúChocolate Therapy. Must‚Äôve been *really* rough.‚Äù

**Bob** giggled a little, never breaking eye contact with me. He almost seemed excited about it. I heard a groan from across the hall behind me. But I was too caught up with **Bob** now. I couldn‚Äôt believe we were having this isolated‚Ä¶ seemingly deep moment?‚Ä¶ or scene?... together‚Ä¶

**Bob** reached out their hand to me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm **Bob**. Nice to meet you.‚Äù

I reached out mine.

‚ÄúMolly! You as well.‚Äù

**Bob** looked down at their ice cream.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôll see ya around, sometime?‚Äù

I smiled warmly.

‚ÄúSure. That‚Äôd be nice.‚Äù

**Bob** checked out with their single pint of Ice-Cream and exited the store. Only about five minutes later did Frank come over the intercom and inform everyone we were good to collect our pay and head home.

However, as I left Frank pulled me aside.

He looked at me gravely.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Molly. But we can‚Äôt have you back after today.‚Äù

A jolt of anxiety struck through me. I knew this could happen.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ why?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why I played dumb. I guess I just wanted to hear him say it.

‚ÄúYou looked.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt get to bed until about 3AM and naturally slept in a bit later than usual. It wasn‚Äôt often I was woken by the sun during these short winter days; I had almost forgotten how much I loved that.

I rolled over in bed, snagged my phone, and unlocked it to check my messages.

My heart stopped.

Three messages from an unknown number

‚ÄúHey, it's Bob. What are you doing today?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought maybe we could go out for dinner?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry if this is too forward, I just feel like we had a special connection last night.‚Äù

What. The. Fuck.

It's moments like these that really make me hesitate to even share who this person is. Because it would instantly make you think what I‚Äôm relaying is a lie. It feels more true when I withhold it.

Where do I even begin to convey the way I felt in this moment?¬†

Flattered? Horrified? Exhilarated? Numb?

I don‚Äôt know. But one thing I did know, is that this was the opportunity of a lifetime and I was not about to let it pass me by. I won‚Äôt lie, I was a little freaked out. Where had they gotten my number? The call-sheet? Did **Bob** even know there was one?¬†

However, I decided I simply couldn‚Äôt trouble myself with these concerns. If I actually became friends with **Bob**, who knows what it could mean for my career as an actor? What opportunities could come my way?

‚ÄúHey **Bob**. Nice to hear from you! Yes, I‚Äôd love to. When and where were you thinking?‚Äù

We met at Takuetsu in the heart of downtown LA. I guess it means ‚Äòexcellence‚Äô in Japanese. When I arrived, the staff personally escorted me to the back entrance. The staff guided me through the kitchen, where I saw a brigade of young Japanese men executing at the absolute highest caliber of their craft. Slicing sushi in what to me seemed like slow motion. Every decision, every step was so calculated.

I was brought through two double doors to a side of the restaurant that was clearly private. Within that room were a series of private dining rooms. A glass door to one slid open and there was **Bob** sitting crisscrossed at a low traditional Japanese style table.

‚ÄúMolly. So wonderful to see you‚Äù.

Their voice sounded like gold. It was still familiar to me as their own, but it was, at the same time, so different. So much more alluring than I remember in the grocery store.

‚ÄúThank you so much **Bob**‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never been somewhere like this before‚Ä¶‚Äù

We had an amazing meal. Things were a little rocky for me at start, mostly due to still being a bit star struck at what was occurring. But **Bob** had a way of making you feel so comfortable, I gradually was able to loosen up, and just be myself.¬†

**Bob** mentioned that he had a highly exclusive ceremony coming up next month with a lot of industry professionals in attendance, and they wanted me to join them. I almost felt bad, as I genuinely felt I was getting to know **Bob** as a person, and felt guilty for getting to benefit off of them in this way. But I couldn‚Äôt say no. It would‚Äôve been rude anyway right?

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to!‚Äù

**Bob** and I got together a few more times. Lunch at the Sunset Diner. A movie at The Chinese Theater. They even helped me rehearse for a couple auditions. But the creeping uncertainty of **Bob**‚Äôs reality crawled back under my skin during an afternoon trip to the LA Zoo. We were standing next to two little boys outside of the Lion enclosure. One of them slapped the other on the shoulder, seemingly annoyed.¬†

That‚Äôs when I heard one of them whisper to the other‚Ä¶

‚ÄúStop, Frank said don‚Äôt look‚Ä¶!‚Äù

I mean, they could‚Äôve just been referring to some other Frank. Maybe their father? Telling them not to mess with the lions‚Ä¶? but part of me knew that wasn‚Äôt true. I looked around at the zoo-goers, but‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt recognize anyone.

It was the day before **Bob**‚Äôs big ‚ÄòCeremony‚Äô. He proclaimed he would buy me a new dress for the big night. I still don‚Äôt know why it never occurred to me to ask **Bob** what this ceremony actually was. Was it the Oscars? Tony‚Äôs? Emmy‚Äôs? Grammy‚Äôs? With **Bob**, they really could be attending any of them, as the guest of honor no less.

But I didn‚Äôt care. I felt like a Goddess around **Bob**. How could you not?

So that brings us to yesterday.

I was to be picked up in a limo. Even though I was excited, I still didn‚Äôt really buy that any of it was real. I did everything in my mind to stamp out the feeling that something was off. That maybe something was about to go wrong. But no matter what I did, that deep gnawing feeling wouldn‚Äôt leave me.

The limo arrived at 11:30AM as planned. I got inside, and there was **Bob** sitting comfortably in the black leather interior. The limo driver, hidden behind a tinted window.

‚ÄúHey Molly, ready to go!?‚Äù

There was such a childlike glee in **Bob**‚Äôs voice. It was contagious.

‚ÄúYah! Let‚Äôs do this!‚Äù

Our chariot began to roll gracefully down my humble street. I wondered if any of my neighbors had seen me get in here. I‚Äôd never been in one before. It was pristinely clean. There were snacks and drinks all loaded up in a basket between us, but I wasn‚Äôt hungry. My stomach was full of butterflies thrashing about.

Time melted away as **Bob** and I chatted in our usual flow. They were so easy to talk to. I took a peek out the window and noticed we were no longer in the city. Long stretches of trees surrounded us on a narrow windy road.

‚ÄúWhere are we going **Bob**?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou'll see, Molly. It's beautiful.‚Äù

We pulled up to an opening in a thick lush forest. It was already getting dark out.¬†

Other limos were lined up side by side at the opening of the forest.

What was this? **Bob** had hyped it up so much, I didn‚Äôt want my speculation to put a damper on things‚Ä¶ So, I elected to keep my mouth shut.

A long rolled red carpet fit snugly into a dirt path that led deep into the woods.¬†

I stood at the head of the red carpet. Something deep inside me started to say to turn back. That this was wrong. It made no sense. It was like something out of a dream. A nightmare.

But **Bob** stood there next to me, offering their hand. Their glistening baby blue eyes piercing my heart.

I walked with **Bob** down the red carpet. As the sunlight disappeared into the trees around us, a new glow emerged in the distance.¬†

‚ÄúAlmost there, Molly.‚Äù

The red carpet became more bumpy the deeper we went. The thick roots of the trees were unavoidable and the geography less touched by man.

We turned a bend and entered a clearing. A seemingly pleasant party was in full effect. China-ball style lights hung from tree branches and other celebrities, many of which you would certainly know, stood about chatting to one another in the peaceful buzz of night-time nature. A young man in a suit with a tight red bow tie walked about with mini appetizers on a silver platter.

I‚Äôve always been a sucker for pigs in a blanket.

I motioned to **Bob** and they chuckled. I approached the server.

‚ÄúExcuse me, but-‚Äù

The server turned. Now revealed to be Dimitri.

‚Äú-oh! Uh‚Ä¶ Dimitri?‚Äù

They showed no recollection of who I was.

‚ÄúSorry, Madame. Would you like an hors d'oeuvre?‚Äù

‚ÄúDimitri, it's me, Molly? Do you not remember?‚Äù

Dimitri smiled, looking just below my chin.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Miss. You must have me mistaken for somebody else.‚Äù

Dimitri walked away with the grace of someone who was definitely *NOT* panicking the way I now was. What was going on here? Where was I? And‚Ä¶ why would Dimitri not look me in the eyes just then‚Ä¶

Just then, the jingle of a little bell sounded tinged through the soft cool night.

‚ÄúAttention everyone!‚Äù¬†

**Bob** was now holding court in the middle of the party.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to introduce this month's guest of honor.‚Äù

**Bob** motioned their hand out towards‚Ä¶ *me!?*

Every celebrity I had grown up watching was suddenly staring, their soft knowing looks overloading my very soul to its brim with‚Ä¶ fear? *Why‚Ä¶?*

‚ÄúWhen I first met Molly, she showed a level of love and connection that I haven‚Äôt bore witness to in a long, long, time. She is most certainly deserving of a better life. One of wealth, admiration, and abundance. Shall we let her walk with us? Shall we let her share our fortune?‚Äù

Everyone lifted their glass, as if toasting some new life for me‚Ä¶

Just as I began to try and even decipher what the fuck **Bob** had just said, I heard yelling.¬†

Crazed yelling; coming from deep within the woods.

From the shadows, small woodland creatures scattered about the party.

Disgruntled looks began to infect the faces of the party guests.

*‚Äú... CLOSE YOUR EYES! ‚Ä¶ THEY‚ÄôLL TAKE YOU!‚Äù*

From the woods, the stocky man I had met on my first day emerged. He was completely naked, and now, rail-thin. Flabs of loose skin swung from his arms. His eyes were bloodshot and dried up. He whimpered like a sick dog that had no tears left to cry.

I noticed all the butlers had fallen to the ground as well, hiding their faces in the grass below.

The stocky man wilted like a dying flower. The last life-force he had, exerted through his pointing finger. He took a deep breath and pleaded to me:

*‚ÄúRUN! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!‚Äù*

I looked around me, the members of this prestigious party looked at me with a gaze of building intensity. At this moment, **Bob** felt like the only person I had left to turn to‚Ä¶ but I wish I never had.¬†

‚Äú**Bob**‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù

**Bob** began to frown. But, not a natural frown. It was more like strings that had been holding the corners of their mouth up had been snapped loose. Their eyes, once sparkling ocean blue, were now dark as midnight riptides. Slowly but surely, every piece of **Bob** began to deconstruct. **Bob**‚Äôs hair began to shrivel like dried grass atop their head. I took a step back in fear and tripped on a nearby tree root protruding from the ground.

**Bob** towered over me. Face to face with them, I felt myself slipping into a psychedelic-like trance. On command, their face seemingly unfolded like a blossoming flower of flesh. Centered amongst the bloody petals was their skull. The white of it began to glow and shifted to a powerful electric blue. In this dream-like state, I had an unconscious revelation. This radiating light, emanating off their hot mineral braincase was the source of all their brilliance. All their charm. **Bob** was not human. They were something‚Ä¶ *greater.*

The heat of their being forced me to turn away from Bob. Seeing the grass below me, something real‚Ä¶ tangible, suddenly sobered my mind. Waves of fear crashed through my nervous system like a flash flood. I became paralyzed. I wanted to wake up so badly. I would have rather died than live out another second in that reality.¬†

*‚ÄúYOU'RE EYES, THEY'LL STEAL YOUR EYES-""*

The stocky man‚Äôs final cries turned to chunky gargles. It sounded like someone tore his esophagus straight out of his throat‚Ä¶

I ran. As fast as my body could take me. I only looked back once.

Dimitri‚Äôs face in the grass. TV Personalities, Child Stars, and Musicians I listened to on a daily basis, all transformed into what I can only describe as a blur of God‚Äôs ugliest, most vile designs.

After a while of aimless sprinting, I came across the red carpet. I tore down it as my guide for what felt like forever. Isn‚Äôt it supposed to feel faster on the way back..? As I grew weaker, I could hear **Bob** in my ear, repeating quickly in a sharp whisper:

***^(""mollymollymollymollymollymollymollymollymollymolly"")***

Tears leapt from the ledges of my eyes. It felt like he was right behind me. I turned and saw that he was in fact at least a mile back... This confused, but relieved me for a moment. However, only as I continued running did I realize that **Bob** was closing in on me with incredible, seemingly impossible speed.

***""MOLLYMOLLYMOLLYMOLLYMOLLYMOLLYMOLLY""***

Their beaming skull chattering my name over and over, illuminating the dark woods like a flaming meteor.

It felt like every part of my body and mind that was not essential to my escape just shut off right then and there, it all becomes a haze to recall until... I could see the limo just ahead and‚Ä¶ Frank, in that stupid white button-up smoking against the hood of the car.¬†

*‚ÄúFRANK!‚Äù*

I yelled with adamance.

Frank spun and turned to see my running, and likely the nightmare close behind.

He dropped his cigarette and shielded his eyes swiftly.

*‚ÄúSTART THE CAR FRANK!‚Äù*

Frank hesitated, but then shuttered and whatever might happen to him if he waited any longer.

Frank started the car; the headlights nearly blinded me for the final stretch. As **Bob** closed in behind me, I could smell their blood, dripping from their own torn skin, evaporating on the surface of their burning skull.

Finally, I reached the car, swung the door open, forced myself inside, and slammed the door shut with me.

*‚ÄúDRIVE!‚Äù*¬†

Frank, seemingly unfamiliar with how to drive a limo, awkwardly jerked us forward, back, and then peeled off down the dirt road we came in on.

As we pulled away, **Bob** merely stood in the distance behind us. The blur of their face slowly began retaking its normal, handsome self. I could feel their restrained fury in my body for the first few miles, my eyes stuck on patrol out the back window. However, once Frank started mumbling about how he would lose his job over this, I could somehow feel we were safe.

This morning I immediately began packing my things.

I just checked into a hotel about 50 miles outside of town.

**Bob** was smiling on the TV when I came in.

Some soap opera he did when he was probably closer to my age.

Buzzing with that same raw young talent that reminded me of poor Dimitri.

I unplugged the TV set.

I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going from here.

I hear they don‚Äôt have Ralphs in San Francisco.

That‚Äôll do for now.

Hailee's POV

I have two secrets. Two deep, dangerous secrets the people of the Full Moon Pack don't know. One‚Äîif they ever found out‚Äîwould make them bow and worship me. The other? They'd be too afraid to even look me in the eye. But I've kept both to myself, pretending to be the weak omega, the cook's daughter no one notices.

Only two people know. My mother‚Äîand Lila, my best friend. I told Lila one of them two months ago, and thankfully, she didn't treat me any differently. Just two omega girls, still best friends.

""Hailee! You're running late! Didn't you mention you have a test?"" my mother's loud yelling echoed from downstairs.

Rolling my eyes, I stared at myself one last time in the mirror. I wasn't pretty enough to be noticed, nor plain enough to be invisible. I was just there.

A mess of wavy, deep auburn hair framed my face, the strands falling past my shoulders like wildfire in motion. My eyes were the color of the sky, sometimes silver when the light caught them just right‚Äîand my skin, pale and speckled with faint freckles, looked almost delicate. I had a small scar just beneath my left eye, a faded reminder of a childhood accident I didn't like talking about.

I ran my fingers through my tangled hair, pulled it into a quick braid, and grabbed the worn-out backpack by the bed. The straps were fraying, and one of the zippers didn't close all the way, but it held what I needed: my books‚Ä¶ and the small locket I never took out in front of anyone. Not even Lila.

""I'm coming!"" I yelled back, slinging the bag over my shoulder and hopping down the stairs two at a time.

My mother stood in the kitchen, apron dusted with flour, wiping her hands on a cloth. Her eyes met mine. She looked tired, a little worried, but proud. She handed me a wrapped sandwich and a bottle of water.

""Don't look for trouble today,"" she whispered. ""No matter what.""

I nodded. We never talked about the secrets out loud, but she always had a way of reminding me to stay out of trouble.

I left through the back door, not wanting to run into any of the ranked wolves. They always had something cruel to say, especially Alpha Dominic's daughter, Clara. She hated that I existed, and even more that Lila chose to hang out with me instead of her.

The school building came into view as I stepped onto the main road, and like clockwork, Lila appeared beside me with her usual lopsided grin and two steaming cups of instant coffee.

""Look who's alive and not in a coma from oversleeping,"" she teased, handing me one. ""You owe me.""

I took the coffee, feeling grateful. ""I'll repay you in hugs and sarcasm.""

We both giggled as we made our way toward the school entrance, the scent of freshly cut grass and blooming flowers mingling with the usual teenage chaos. Our school, Moonridge Academy, stood tall like a castle, its stone walls and towering gates a clear sign of its importance, not just to our pack, but to every pack in London.

It wasn't just any school. It was the biggest and best in all the werewolf territories around here, built right at the heart of the Full Moon Pack. Students came from far and wide‚Äîespecially from elite families. Alphas' kids, Betas' kids, Gammas' kids‚Ä¶ they all walked the same halls as we did. And somehow, they let us‚Äîlowly omegas‚Äîattend too.

Of course, it wasn't out of kindness. It was a strategy. They needed the best minds, the best fighters, and the best pawns. So even if you were an omega, if you had something valuable to offer, you were in. Barely.

""I heard something crazy yesterday,"" Lila said as we passed through the school gates, her voice dropping to a whisper just for me. ""And I mean crazy crazy.""

I arched a brow. ""Crazier than the time Clara tried to flirt with the Beta's son from the Blood Stone Pack and got rejected in front of everyone?""

""Worse,"" she said, her eyes gleaming with gossip. ""I heard Alpha Linton's son‚Äîyou know that Alpha from the forest Pack?‚Äîhe's transferring here. Like, for his final year.""

My footsteps stopped for a second. ""Really?""

Lila nodded eagerly. ""Yes. His son's name is Caelan or Callum or something, I don't remember. But I've heard he's insanely powerful‚Äîand also hot.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Of course that part matters.""

""It always matters,"" she said, bumping her shoulder into mine playfully. ""But get this‚Äîthere's more. Apparently, another Alpha's Daughter is transferring too. Alpha Zach's.""

My eyes widened. ""Alpha Zach? As in Alpha of the Dark Claw Pack?""

She nodded again. ""Yes. His daughter's name is Lucie. And let's just say‚Ä¶ I heard she is the main character type. Always snooping.""

Great. As if our school didn't already have enough egos walking around in perfectly tailored uniforms.

""And you know what this means, right?"" Lila added, her voice barely above a whisper. ""More drama."" She teased, and I playfully rolled my eyes at her while she giggled.

Reaching my locker, I opened it and took out a textbook, but then I froze.

I could feel someone behind me. That familiar, heavy feeling that made my skin crawl. Slowly, I turned around.

And there he was.

Nathan. Our Alpha's son.

He stood there with his arms crossed and a smirk on his face like he owned the whole world. His bright-green eyes locked onto mine, and for a second, I forgot how to breathe. He looked annoyingly perfect. Messy black hair, strong jawline, and a body that screamed Alpha. He had just turned eighteen last week, and the entire pack threw a huge party for him.

But sadly, he didn't find his mate. And that made his attitude get worse.

Nathan is my nightmare.

Since the moment I came to the Full Moon Pack four years ago, he's made my life miserable. He's mean, rude, and treats me like I'm less than nothing. And to make it even worse, he forced me to be his errand girl. I fetch his stuff, carry his notes, and do whatever he wants.

""Morning, sunshine,"" Nathan said in his usual mocking voice. ""Rough night?""

I clenched my teeth. He wanted me to fight back, to get angry‚Äîbut I wasn't going to give him that satisfaction.

""Do you need something?"" I asked, trying to sound bored.

""Of course,"" he said and threw a crumpled paper at me. ""Copy my notes from yesterday. Make them neat. No mistakes.""

I caught the paper and held it tight in my fist.

I forced a smile, bitter and fake. ""Of course. Anything for you‚Ä¶ your highness.""

He scoffed gently, and patted my head like always. But except this time, his hand lingered for a second too long. I looked up, expecting mockery. But he wasn't even looking at me. He looked‚Ä¶ lost, but before I could dwell on it, he turned around and strolled away.

Lila moved to my side, her face etched with a frown. ""I swear, one day I'm going to punch him. Right in the face.""

I sighed and took a deep breath. ""Just two more months‚Ä¶ It'll all be over,"" I said, and Lila nodded, understanding exactly what I meant.

We turned to head to class, but before I could enter, the principal came out from a corner.

""Hailee. My office. Now,"" he said firmly, not even waiting for a response as he turned away.

My heart sank. The last time I got called to his office, I was suspended.

Now? I had no idea what kind of trouble I'd landed in‚Äîbut I had a bad feeling.

He looked annoyingly perfect. Messy black hair, strong jawline, and a body that screamed Alpha. He had just turned eighteen last week, and the entire pack threw a huge party for him.

But sadly, he didn't find his mate. And that made his attitude get worse.

Nathan is my nightmare.

Since the moment I came to the Full Moon Pack four years ago, he's made my life miserable. He's mean, rude, and treats me like I'm less than nothing. And to make it even worse, he forced me to be his errand girl. I fetch his stuff, carry his notes, and do whatever he wants.

""Morning, sunshine,"" Nathan said in his usual mocking voice. ""Rough night?""

I clenched my teeth. He wanted me to fight back, to get angry‚Äîbut I wasn't going to give him that satisfaction.

""Do you need something?"" I asked, trying to sound bored.

""Of course,"" he said and threw a crumpled paper at me. ""Copy my notes from yesterday. Make them neat. No mistakes.""

I caught the paper and held it tight in my fist.

I forced a smile, bitter and fake. ""Of course. Anything for you‚Ä¶ your highness.""

He scoffed gently, and patted my head like always. But except this time, his hand lingered for a second too long. I looked up, expecting mockery. But he wasn't even looking at me. He looked‚Ä¶ lost, but before I could dwell on it, he turned around and strolled away.

Lila moved to my side, her face etched with a frown. ""I swear, one day I'm going to punch him. Right in the face.""

I sighed and took a deep breath. ""Just two more months‚Ä¶ It'll all be over,"" I said, and Lila nodded, understanding exactly what I meant.

We turned to head to class, but before I could enter, the principal came out from a corner.

""Hailee. My office. Now,"" he said firmly, not even waiting for a response as he turned away.

My heart sank. The last time I got called to his office, I was suspended.

Now? I had no idea what kind of trouble I'd landed in‚Äîbut I had a bad feeling.",1,1750780597.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Where I live a lot of the fast food restaurants - particularly Tim Hortons - are staffed mostly by Indian immigrants - and I think that's fine.

Lots of people have immigrated into Canada from Asia, and it makes sense that you'd see lots of immigrants from Asia in Canada as a result.

They're generally fluent in English, are usually trying their best just like anyone else.

At the end of the day it doesn't really matter if my burger was flipped by a White guy vs. someone from Pakistan, and I haven't noticed a difference in the taste of my reheated, previously cooked and frozen food or coffee.

Regardless of if someone is of Scottish or Indian descent a BLT will still have bacon, lettuce, and tomato on it, and your coffee or sugar water will still taste the same - and you'll still get it in minutes.

You might just have to slow down for a second when ordering - and may even need to repeat yourself - or ask them to repeat themselves - e.g., due to an accent - but usually not - and, that's fine, I think.

*This will be my first story, feedback welcomed!*   
*Now on with the show!*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

‚ÄúToday marks a momentous day for the citizens of the United Terra Federation, as billions gather wherever they can to witness the historic first teleportation of a living human!‚Äù the news anchor announced on the vidscreen.¬†

*Of course it is.* ¬†John thought to himself.

The feed shifted to an aerial view of the Hawking Advanced Research Platform. Crowds flooded into the multiple observation fields equipped with large vidscreens surrounding the facility.¬† H.A.R.P. sprawled across the landscape‚Äîits gigafactory-scale structures bristling with activity. At its heart rose a massive, oval-shaped tower, thirty stories tall, flanked by distant landing pads where atmospheric-rated ships touched down in waves.

He shut off the screen with a flick of his hand.

He sat alone in a room built for more‚Äîquarters meant for larger groups, big enough to hold families saying their goodbyes before missions.

John had no one.

He thought of his ex-wife, who left him after the miscarriage. She‚Äôd sent a single video‚Äîapologizing, saying she needed someone present, someone who could be there while he was off-world.

Then there was the woman he fell for years later. Captured. Mutilated. Executed. Her death was broadcast like sport, streamed across every platform imaginable.

And finally, his twin sister and niece‚Äîlost in a freak accident during the years he was presumed KIA.

A knock at the door.

‚ÄúColonel, you‚Äôre requested in the suit-up room,‚Äù came the voice from the other side.

John exhaled slowly.

‚ÄúTime to rock and roll‚Äù muttered John as he got up.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The room felt small, despite it being the size of a board room. The only living being in the cold, dimly lit, sterile space is him and the MP by the door.¬†

‚ÄúSeems like everyone‚Äôs tuning in for the show. Are you ready, sir?‚Äù asked the being assisting him with the hardsuit.¬†

John turned and saw the synth - a male variant - smiling - mimicking human expression, one that‚Äôs a little too perfect. Too controlled. Too‚Ä¶ unhuman.

No matter how many times John met one since his return a year ago, he still couldn‚Äôt get used to looking at the human-like synth.

He‚Äôd remembered reading - that after the **Zero-Point Cascade Reactor** came online nearly two decades ago, scientific advancement has skyrocketed. A.I. could finally operate at greater capacity without triggering a planetary-scale blackout. Progress came so fast that the Guinness book of records eventually stopped trying to keep up.

He‚Äôd seen A.I. operating in android shells, robotic frames, hell - he was issued one during his deployment.¬†

The synths though? They are something new. A recent breakthrough‚Ä¶ right alongside the reason John is here today.

**Project ECLIPSE**

Officially known as: **Experimental Continuum Leap Interface for Planetary-Scale Experimentation.**

It sounded like it‚Äôs dreamt up by a bunch of scientists who had spent countless sleepless nights trying to impress the pencil-pushers to approve the budget.¬†

‚ÄúIs it bad if I say I‚Äôm having second thoughts?‚Äù John joked.

‚ÄúAnd show the world a war hero chickening out of a mission that is one for the books?‚Äù The synth asked, feigning his shock. ‚ÄúPlus, it‚Äôs too late to pull out now. You did volunteer for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I wonder why I did it in the first place.‚Äù John muttered

John knew why he volunteered. It was not out of desperation, fame, or fortune. He just needed something to keep himself from being drowned out by the silence, one so loud that it haunts his very being.

‚ÄúScans are in. Physical health‚Äôs all green, considering what you went through, Colonel,‚Äù said the synth in a lab coat. ‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù

‚ÄúHonestly? I feel like I could use some coffee, Doc.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn due time, Colonel,‚Äù she replied, wheeling away in her chair towards her console.

‚ÄúOkay, Colonel. You‚Äôre all suited up. You‚Äôre good to run diagnostics,‚Äù said the other synth

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù John replied, giving the suit a little wiggle to test the fit. ‚ÄúSuits online.‚Äù¬†

The helmet unfolds from the suit and attaches itself over his head. His HUD flickered to life as the seals engaged.

‚ÄúGood morning, Colonel,‚Äù said the voice inside his helmet.

‚ÄúGood morning, A.I.D.A.,‚Äù John greeted his Artificial Intelligent Data Analyst - the A.I. assigned to accompany him on this mission. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everything looking?‚Äù

‚ÄúTelemetry online. Suit sensors online. Black box online. Radio check,‚Äù stated A.I.D.A.

‚ÄúChecking one-two,‚Äù John said into the mic.

‚ÄúRadio check confirmed and functioning. Final integrity check: green across the board.‚Äù

‚ÄúLooking good on our end too, sir,‚Äù said the Synth, giving John the thumbs up.

¬†John returned the gesture, thinking, *Keep forgetting that these new A.I. 's aren't like the ones before.*

And once again, John‚Äôs back in a hardsuit. Not the heavy military model he‚Äôs familiar with, but a civilian one - barely.¬†

He tugged on his chestplate. It‚Äôs magnetically locked, the polished U.T.F. insignia etched in blue and silver gleaming back at him. Too clean. Too shiny. It looked like something that came with a hefty monthly insurance plan.

He padded his sides. Standard medkit on the left - bulkier than he remembered. An empty magnetic clamp on the right.¬†

*Huh. Extra storage space,* thought John. *Neat.*

His hand drifted to his belt. Instead of a toolkit, his finger brushed across old engravings - he drew the ceremonial knife and turned it over. The same one they awarded him when he was field-promoted to Captain.

He sheathed it with a click and kept going. Then - his fingers closed around a familiar grip by his hip.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù John asked.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the standard issue P-9 Operator pistol, sir!‚Äù the MP by the door reported.

John looked at him - a Sergeant, nametag too far to read. ‚ÄúNo shit, Sergeant. I‚Äôm asking why I‚Äôm being issued one - plus the three bonus mags?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo signify your military background, Colonel,‚Äù the synth beside him chimed in. ‚ÄúWhile this *is* a civilian mission, command deemed it fitting for you to carry your weapons - for ceremonial purposes‚Äù

‚ÄúCivilian mission, my ass‚Äù muttered John, frowning.

With that, he had checked all his physical gears.¬†

If he didn‚Äôt know any better, it felt like they‚Äôre preparing to send him off back behind enemy lines. Everything about the suit screamed military - except for the paint job: a white shell, red bands on the upper arms and legs, with carbon black lining, and gold-tinted visor that looked more for show than function.

It reminded him of the old Apollo suit worn by the first man on the moon.

‚ÄúI take it the colours were chosen on purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. Command thought it would be poetic.‚Äù

*Wonderful. A walking PR stunt,* John thought, flexing his elbows and shifting his stance in place.

‚ÄúLooking good, Colonel,‚Äù says the MP.

‚ÄúThanks, Sergeant,‚Äù John replied, slapping his chestplate with one hand and firing off a finger gun with the other. His helmet retracted with a hiss.

‚ÄúFeels like I could take on the world. And then some.‚Äù

The sergeant smiled, then dipped his head, finger pressed against his earpiece.

‚ÄúT-minus 30 minutes, sir‚Äù the Sergeant reported. ‚ÄúDirector Halvorsen would like to do the final briefing here. He‚Äôs on his way now.‚Äù  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Footsteps approached.

The door swung open. In walks Director Halvorsen, flanked by a pair of armed guards in U.T.F. Navy fatigues.

Halvorsen gave a nod. ‚ÄúColonel Waltkins.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDirector.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything good to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. Suit‚Äôs green, body in one piece, heads still attached. I‚Äôm ready as ever‚Äù

‚ÄúHeh, still a jokester, eh Colonel?‚Äù Halvorsen chuckled.

John gave him a playful wink.

Halvorsen glanced at the timer display on the wall. ‚ÄúFinal run-down, Colonel. You‚Äôre scheduled to arrive at Luna Command in twenty minutes. You‚Äôll step through the portal, get a hero‚Äôs welcome from the masses, deliver a short speech, and go down in history as the first man to undergo instantaneous travel.‚Äù

‚ÄúDouble it and give it to the next person?‚Äù

‚ÄúHA!‚Äù Halvorsen laughed. ‚ÄúYou and your jokes. Outdated, yet somehow still relevant.‚Äù¬†

Halvorsen stepped in close, placing his firm arm around John. ‚ÄúToday is not just about teleporting cargo, Colonel. Oh no - we‚Äôve been doing that for nearly half a decade, supplying daily necessities and critical components across our colonies‚Äù he said, his tone dropping a notch.

‚ÄúToday, we‚Äôre teleporting - you.‚Äù¬†

He tapped a finger just shy of John‚Äôs nose.¬†

‚ÄúA living, breathing, human - in the flesh, to the moon.‚Äù He stretched his free hand upward. As if grabbing onto something far beyond.

He turned to John, locking his eyes. ‚ÄúAfter this, the world will no longer be the same ever again.‚Äù¬†

And just like that - the silence hit.

**It flashed before him, like the black and white reel behind his eye**

**Ten years.**¬† That‚Äôs how long he was gone.

¬†¬†Declared KIA after the *Olympus* went down in the Belt during the final year of the war.

¬†¬†But fate had other plans.

¬†¬†A single stasis pod was found - buried deep in an asteroid by miners.¬† A pod designed to last for months, not years.¬† A pod he had no recollection of entering.¬† A pod he could have never reached - not with those wounds.

¬†¬†Yet he lived.

¬†¬†A dead man walked among the living once again- found nearly a year ago, in a condition no average joe could‚Äôve survived.¬†

¬†¬†The world wasn‚Äôt the one he remembered. ¬† A man out of time. ¬† And this mission?¬† It was his way to push forward - or maybe his last.

¬†A.I.D.A chimed  
‚ÄúElevated heart rate detected. Are you alright, Colonel?‚Äù

It snapped John back to reality. ‚ÄúYea, just nervous.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt *is* a historic day, Colonel.‚Äù Halvorsen says with a nod.¬†

Halvorsen released his grip on John and clasped his hands behind his back, standing straight. ‚ÄúI take it you have some grand speech prepared?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wing it‚Äù John exhaled, hoping the director did not notice his episode. ‚ÄúGo in, say a few inspirational words, then cracking open a cold one‚Äù

¬†Halvorsen patted his shoulder ‚ÄúThe people are going to love you, John.‚Äù

my husband is finishing a big project right now & it‚Äôs eating all his time, energy, &  headspace. he‚Äôs an artist, so am I. it‚Äôs not uncommon for us to become obsessive with our work & we will often even collaborate. I wouldn‚Äôt be concerning myself with this at all, it‚Äôs not wildly uncommon & I support & love my partner, but it‚Äôs impacting our intimacy. I am collaborating with him on the project, but my role is more so that of an editor & designer so I am significantly less involved. the all-consuming nature of the project has been frustrating. I feel like whenever we spend time together it‚Äôs all he wants to talk about. It‚Äôs interesting work so I engage to a point, but it‚Äôs just become our entire atmosphere. 

He has no boundaries with it so I‚Äôm constantly getting ‚Äúnotes‚Äù on the work I am doing at all hours of the day. he will be gone all day at his studio working on this then come home & keep going, staying up until the wee hours of the morning or just straight up not sleeping at all. It feels like I‚Äôm living with my boss right now more so than it does my significant other. I miss sleeping next to him, having the little shared moments of life like waking up next to one another or having meals at the same time & table. 

I‚Äôve been feeling myself slip into a depression lately, the state of the world is quite intense and I‚Äôm just feeling crushed by the precarious nature of being a full time artist in an economy like ours here in US right now. We only moved to the area we live in about a year ago & so the friends I have around me aren‚Äôt very close or reliable & I don‚Äôt have family nearby either. I‚Äôm just feeling an intense loneliness & I‚Äôve been honest with my husband about this. I don‚Äôt expect him to fill all my voids but I also don‚Äôt want to feel so lonely when we are together. he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that it matters to me to just have these small things like falling asleep together and cuddling all night, having mornings where we share coffee in bed or prepare breakfast together before parting ways for the day, or even just having the downtime to relax on the sofa & watch a movie. For me foreplay is an all day thing & it exists in these sweet tiny gestures. So we have barely been having sex at all‚Ä¶ 

Yesterday he was about to leave and I asked him if we could have a chill night together & just focus on intimacy. he said yes, but that after we chilled he was going to keep working from home‚Ä¶ this annoyed me so as he was walking away I blurted out ‚Äúfine, but don‚Äôt come complaining to me wondering why our sex life is suffering‚Äù‚Ä¶ he got pissed, said I was being manipulative & pointed towards a quickie we had recently to prove that everything was ‚Äúfine.‚Äù He stormed out, I sent an apology text. He got home late, spent 30 minutes or more talking to me about the project, giving me notes on what I needed to be doing with the week ahead & updated me with deadlines before he even mentioned that he‚Äôd read my text & wanted to talk about it. When I tried to tell him I felt lonely because I miss sleeping next to him and sharing these moments that aren‚Äôt project related he laughed it off and said it was ridiculous that I had this expectation for him to have the same schedule as me. I keep trying to vocalize that this is important to me and he just doesn‚Äôt seem to get it. I am worried he‚Äôs heading fast towards burnout and that I‚Äôll be having to pick up the pieces when that happens. 

I miss my partner & am getting sick of living with my project manager 24/7. It‚Äôs complicated because it‚Äôs all wrapped up in projects I care about & an art practice that fuels me. Our anniversary is this week & when I asked him what he wanted to do that day he said he was going to work. when I said ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs our anniversary ‚Äú he went ‚Äúoh yeah‚Ä¶ well we can do whatever it is you want to do. Just come up with a plan‚Äù. I‚Äôd like to have some input & not have to plan everything (I usually am the one arranging dates, it‚Äôs lopsided). I‚Äôm just feeling like my emotions are fully on the back burner here & it‚Äôs hard to know how to get thru to him about this. Any advice on how to repair this? He has different needs than me, I get that. The work is important, I get that too. But I feel like there‚Äôs not a lot of compromise happening to help accommodate my needs as well in all of this. I‚Äôve been shutting down and withdrawing and it just makes me sad because the moments we are together just feel terribly out of synch",1,1750780508.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

Morning inertia ‚Üí low-priority hyperfocus ‚Üí 3 p.m. regret. Looking for strategies (med or otherwise) to make the focus useful.

Hi all, I'm on 70mg Vyvanse plus coffee taken first thing in the morning. Even if I ‚Äúpre-dose‚Äù 2‚Äì3 hours before I plan to wake, I still feel glued to the bed when the alarm goes off.

Once I‚Äôm up, I start with an easy task to warm up. Without noticing, the Vyvanse ramps up and I zero-in on that low-value task for hours. Meanwhile, the higher-priority work my manager cares about sits untouched. By the time I come to my senses, it‚Äôs mid-afternoon and my fuel is fading. ¬†I've tried to ""eat the frog"" in the morning and get started on the high priority task, but usually it's so cognitively/activationally demanding that I can't stick to the task for long.

I was on 40 mg Adderall XR for 8 years and didn‚Äôt have this issue. It blasted me out of bed and helped me prioritize, but I switched to Vyvanse because I‚Äôm out of grad school now and wanted something smoother. I discussed this issue with my doctor and went in for labs and everything is normal; nothing medical (iron, thyroid, vitamin deficiency, etc.) showed up.¬†

I do appreciate Vyvanse‚Äôs smoother feel compared with Adderall so I don‚Äôt want to go back really, but right now I‚Äôm a smooth-running zombie on the wrong projects...

**Questions**

1. Has anyone successfully paired Vyvanse with a booster (e.g., IR dex) to cut morning inertia? Can I even have my prescriber do that if I‚Äôm already on max dose Vyvanse?
2. Experiences adding Qelbree or another med to help with task prioritization?
3. Non-med tips that actually shifted your focus from ‚Äúeasy-but-pointless‚Äù to ‚Äúhard-but-important‚Äù? I‚Äôve tried so many apps/pomodoro techniques/planted trees using Forest but nothing really works

The realization hits you like an oblivious driver hits an unsupervised child. Emerges the question, who is the sorry soul cast with the burden behind the demise of innocent, pure, fresh life. Surely, it couldn‚Äôt be the driver, who had no way of knowing that a small body would spontaneously run onto the road in chase of a ball, vibrantly striped yellow and red against the pavement. What about the parents, shouldn‚Äôt they have been paying close attention to their child, or rejecting his endless pleads to go play outside? No, you can‚Äôt blame the parents. They were overwhelmed with the jobs that house and feed them on top of the bills, the taxes, the judgment, the hassling. Too much was on their backs for it to be their fault. Afterall, it might just be their first time living too. Maybe it‚Äôs the child‚Äôs own doing, who absentmindedly ran onto the street, forgetting to look left and right like they‚Äôre taught in preschool or those obnoxious television programs. Of course not, children are just mere masses of flesh who weren‚Äôt give enough time to comprehend that they are closer to death by the second, one way or another. Brains limited to simplicity. In those 24.3 seconds, that ball was all his universe was, slowly drifting away from him.¬†*Chase the ball, that is your purpose, that is all that matters.*¬†

Was it the teenage cashier at the grocery store who offishly sold the ball to the boy‚Äôs mother? Was it the pale-skinned European factory worker who painted the red and yellow stripes onto it? This is a stupid train of thought. No matter who or what is to blame, the accident was fatal. Life was deprived of a mind yet to develop, while those who developed long ago were left with feelings of misery and mourning that would eat them up until every last shred of skin was decayed beneath 6 feet of dirt. But it‚Äôs all God‚Äôs plan, right? Maybe we should count the boy lucky.¬†

The human brain was cursed with curiosity, questions that will never be answered. If God exists, who is¬†*his*¬†Lord? If God exists, why didn‚Äôt he just tell us? Supposedly he left traces of existence, messages sent to the few chosen. That way, only those of true faith will join him in paradise. But if that‚Äôs the case, why did he stop? We don‚Äôt see Prophets in this day and age. Perhaps holy history is made up of hallucinations, perhaps the excruciating heat of Mecca led to deranged visions, and the unfortunate Moroccan man was just another tragic example of the human capacity to hate. Hate. It can‚Äôt exist without love/ Everyone who hates must love, even if it‚Äôs small and insignificant.¬†

The idea that religion is merely a coping mechanism is not revolutionary nor that uncommon, so why do I feel so guilty for thinking outside the box? If you have faith that the box is salvage, then once you take your final breath, there is nothing to lose if you were wrong the entire time. And the cat inside the box, well she's both dead and alive until you open it. I always believed that thought experiment was stupid, until I realized that‚Äôs the whole point. Your observation isn‚Äôt in line with the forces of nature, especially your uncertainty. Perhaps the men of our society are made up of Judge Holdens, who hate the idea that something may exist without their knowledge.¬†

I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve rambled as per usual. I won‚Äôt tell you my name, simply because I don‚Äôt see how that would help fulfill my purpose. My purpose is to tell you a story. This is the story of how the red and yellow striped ball was never what we thought it was. The smell of freshly cut green grass, the blood-stained sunset dimming the clouds, the shining skin navy blue truck becoming indented, were all the beginning of our eternal punishment. Don‚Äôt search for tiny holes of white light, for they slowly started to close up. We can not escape this. But for some reason, amidst our putrescence, I see you beside me. You‚Äôve always looked after me, your figure is hard to make out, like a slight blur in the mirror. Infinity is lost, so with the time we have left, I suppose we‚Äôre all owed a bit of an explanation, especially you.¬†

November 28th, 1996. ‚ÄúThe Eyes of Providence.‚Äù That‚Äôs what they called themselves. They lived in rural Utah, a great big farm they built for themselves. It was a beautiful scene, really, at least from what the pictures said. The sky was always a bondi blue, the sun created a peaceful yellow blanket of life against grass and skin. They kept animals, these big brown cows, white horses with long silky manes, dogs who would cool themselves in the moist soil, and butterflies. Pink, orange, and purple butterflies with black lines creating floral patterns in their wings and white dots like stars in the midnight sky. The farm building was deep red, like the ones you see in cartoons or eyesight tests. The EoP, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll refer to them as from here. The men had shoulder length hair and beards like brown sheep‚Äôs wool, they wore white robes that fell over their bodies like creamer into coffee. The women also wore white dresses, not the wedding type, but with gloves and bonnets and veil-like fabric that tinted their faces the color of clay. They were all always smiling, and it wasn‚Äôt the forced kind as if they were being held against their will. Their expressions were genuine, of those who felt the pure love of their supposed divine Father.¬†

‚ÄúAnd now for our next segment we strongly advise viewer discretion and especially if there are any children present. As of the early morning, November 29th, 1996, the infamous cult known at The Eyes of Providence in rural Utah have partaken in a mass suicide. The farmhouse in which the one-hundred-and-thirty-five members resided in was intentionally set ablaze.‚Äù¬†

*And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am, John 14:3*¬†

Their leader was Gideon Freeman, a charming man who saw God in all his glory, and his filth. They called him Father Freeman, he was raised in an atheist household. A drunk father, an emotionally absent mother, siblings who he never heard from again after highschool, your typical American white-trash family. When Gideon was a young boy, he was hit by a truck outside of their suburban home. He spent 5 months in a coma, and when he finally came to he was never quite the same. This was the start of what his teachers would label ‚Äútemper-tantrums,‚Äù but I‚Äôd rather refer to them as what they were: violent outbreaks. He loved to draw, but his pieces weren‚Äôt lazy crayola dinosaurs and rocketships, they were visual representations of Hell itself. People were engulfed in flames, screaming in sheer agony, crying for their mothers to come pull them out of this never-ending torture as their flesh became a jet-black char. When asked about these drawing, Gideon always assured his horrified classmates that they deserved to be there, the pain was only a result of ignorance. What really worried his teachers, though, was that he took it upon himself to handle the wrongdoings of his peers. Thomas Peterson was quite the energetic boy, he loved planes, helicopters, trucks, anything that would allow someone to travel without using their own two feet. One day, Thomas rammed his plastic G.I. Joe into Gideon‚Äôs fanciful church made from wooden blocks. All in good fun‚Ä¶ is what Thomas thought. Gideon pinned him to the ground and jammed a freshly sharpened pencil into his left eye, for little Thomas had failed to observe and respect the grounds of his neighbor. This is one of many acts of discipline the six-year-old Gideon had committed, from pulling off fingernails with toy tweezers to constructing fake nooses out of licorice (fortunately, the rope broke when he tried to hang Fatima Bashar off of the monkey bars). His parents always excused his behavior as just a boy playing rough, he did grow up with three brothers after all.

So when the news came out about the mass suicide, investigators speculated that it was Father Freeman's doing. His insatiable thirst for divine discipline had taken over and he felt as if his community had failed God's test. Maybe that was part of the reason, but my ideas involve a concept that is much bigger than all of us. To put it simply, they'll be back. They'll be back, and this time we're coming with them. Every single one of us. So don't bother hiding, don't bother fighting, don't even pray, because you'll only make things worse. The Day of Judgement is among us, and we've burned down the Garden of Eden.

1ljernj,https://i.redd.it/ci0fcxltcw8f1.jpeg,"""Metal diva coffee tasting"" - from an interview from 2000 (translated by Tarja Turunen Suomi)","*Ruotuv√§ki 16.8.2000*

You can find the full translation and the original text¬†[here](https://textsaver.flap.tv/lists/77wu?fbclid=PAQ0xDSwLHomJleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpxOTWe-NXlVBl6xVuLDXY_8SK9wDNyANW2Y8rXlP1rL-EiGtWgOIph7bdFZw_aem_lUV4um3-1jWW2pTJ0hh7YA).

# Metal diva coffee tasting

Nightwish‚Äôs singer¬†**Tarja Turunen**¬†likes to wear wool socks at home. At work she puts on her leather pants and gets on stage to make thousands of people scream.

The coffee in South America is too strong. Nightwish has just gotten back from their tour in Latin America and Turunen is still wondering about the caffeine treats behind the sea.

‚ÄúThe spoon really stood up in the cup,‚Äù she says with amazement.

In between sipping coffee, the northern metal star managed to conquer the hearts of metal folk in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Panama.

‚ÄúIt was really wild in Latin America. It‚Äôs not like that in Europe. Sometimes risky situations happened when people just wanted to touch you,‚Äù Turunen says.  
‚ÄúIn Mexico some lunatic attacked me. Security did throw people into the audience and gave them a smacking but someone was able to get to the stage through backstage and started to pull my hair,‚Äù she tells.  
‚ÄúSometimes it feels that I‚Äôll die in there, when the audience is screaming¬†*Tarja*. It‚Äôs an adrenaline rush. Concerts are the moments of strong feelings.‚Äù

# Taape Duck‚Äôs new clothes

Tarja Turunen‚Äôs singing career has oddly gone from studying opera to heavy stages. Even though the high culture society and the sweaty heavy audience might not understand each other, opera and Nightwish‚Äôs metal show are something similar. Both are melodramatic spectacles. Grandiosity suits Turunen well.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty good at it. I‚Äôm quite a dramatic woman and I love the tragedy. Being the front woman of a band is a slightly narcissistic thing too,‚Äù Turunen says.

When she steps on stage, the situation bafflingly reminds of opera: Turunen performs superstar-heavy woman and sings high mystical emotional music in grand scenes.

Metal diva is one of the opera girl‚Äôs roles. Turunen‚Äôs dream roles in the opera world are also dramatic and tragic.

‚ÄúPeople come to Nightwish concert to see a bombastic show. The woman who walks on stage needs to be divine. When I go on stage, I put on a role costume. I need to be strong and self-confident,‚Äù Turunen tells.

Out of the stage, everyday-Tarja wears sweatpants and wool socks. Her friends have given the poor superstar the nickname¬†**Taape Duck**.

# Lethal touring seeing red

The day after the interview Nightwish is heading for Germany, after which Belgium awaits. After a short break, the band again has a longer European tour. In November the sweet metal melodies are heard in Canada.

‚ÄúLast European tour was pretty lethal. It was pushing the limit because we had so many shows. I wouldn‚Äôt manage touring for more than a couple months at a time at most,‚Äù Turunen says.  
‚ÄúIn Mexico I was seeing red when the venue didn‚Äôt have a proper area to warm up my voice. I should‚Äôve done that in a hotel room, that has no soundproofing. I thought that I can‚Äôt wake people up,‚Äù she recalls.  
‚ÄúSo I went to sing in the dining room behind a sliding door. People were eating and I was singing. I was red in the face when I came out,‚Äù Turunen laughs.

# All dreams coming true

When Turunen started to sing with Nightwish, she was never supposed to do a single concert. The intention was just to visit a studio. Then things took off and suddenly she was in Brazil.

‚ÄúBigwigs have said that this is a market niche. That we could go anywhere with this. It would be incredible to play as an opening act for Dream Theater. That would be a¬†*wow*¬†moment in our career!‚Äù Turunen gets excited.

Nightwish means a nightly dream. For the guys the band is a dream come true, but Tarja‚Äôs life goal is elsewhere.

‚ÄúAlthough I‚Äôm totally on board with this and I love this job, this is only a hobby. At some point I need to try performing in an opera. I need to find out if I have it to be an opera singer. Then I could die.‚Äù

While waiting for death, Turunen has time to make the heavy folk in Asia and Australia kneel. At least Japan should have tea mild enough.",3,1750780356.0,TarjaTurunen,0,1.0,False

This article really explains it well: [https://helloteacup.com/2025/06/24/why-starbucks-is-making-the-right-move-selling-its-china-business/](https://helloteacup.com/2025/06/24/why-starbucks-is-making-the-right-move-selling-its-china-business/)

* Coffee is becoming a commodity, discounts chains are selling coffee at cheap prices and more and more Chinese consumers have coffee machines at home.
* Intense competition from Luckin Coffee on the lower segment of the market.
* Intense competition from premium next-gen coffee chains like SAANCI. Their stores are totally packed in China, while Starbucks is more than half empty.

In my opinion, Starbucks is just moving way too slow to reacted to consumer preferences, local owners can move much faster strategically.

Starbucks is still a high value stock if it can solve its China problems and turn around its business outside of China!

1ljeqml,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ljeqml/aita_for_refusing_to_work_when_its_extremely_hot/,AITA for refusing to work when it's extremely hot?,"

I work at a coffee shop/winery in a brick building with big windows, and it acts like a greenhouse when the sun is out. Our AC broke last summer, and the owners/managers are very aware of this because we keep asking them to fix it, but they keep saying ""we'll get to it"" and never doing anything, which is a common problem to everything in the building.

This past week, we've had a massive heatwave for where I live. It's been high 80s and 90s. It's always at least 5¬∞ hotter inside than it is out, and our kitchen has no ventilation except the doors, so it's usually at least 5¬∞ hotter there than the main building. We couldn't keep our eggs from rotting when it was in the 70s.

Last Wednesday, I had a huge rush of 30+ people right before close, and when I finally finished, I genuinely almost fainted. I had to sit on the floor for a while before I could get up and do my closing duties. I told the opener that it would be a shoddy job and I apologized profusely. I worked Thursday and Friday, too, and was struggling.

Important to know: I'm on medication that makes me more susceptible to the heat. I have trouble sweating or something, I don't remember the exact science.

Yesterday (Monday), I told the sort-of manager that I was worried about my health in the heat, and she just brushed me off and said ""Yeah it's gonna be rough"" and went back to talking with my coworker about some documentaries. That coworker later posted on Facebook about how there was work drama, and I know it's about me not working well last week because they always include me in their gossip unless it's about me.

Anyway, I texted my boss at noon and told him my concerns, too, and told him I wasn't going to be able to stay until the end of my shift at 5. He ignored my text for over an hour. The ice machine broke, so I sent a text to our group chat about it, and he responded immediately. About half an hour after that, he finally asked me to stay until 3-- when the heat was at its peak. I put my foot down and told him I would try, but if I started getting heat exhaustion symptoms, I would leave.

Around 2, I was closing the kitchen and got really dizzy. I told him I was leaving and not coming in today, because the heat was going to be worse.

I feel like I did the right thing, but with my coworkers and higher-ups talking trash behind my back, I'm second guessing myself. I feel like I'm being a baby for not wanting to risk heat stroke at a $10/hr job. A part of me wants to report them for unsafe conditions, too, but we're already skirting the edge of bankruptcy and losing the whole chain. I don't want to be the reason a bunch of people, and myself, become unemployed. But I also don't want anyone to get hurt, because I'm not the only person at this location taking medication that makes heat more dangerous.

AITA?

It was my first time dating someone, and i think it was the first time i fell in love. I always had trouble with dates, it was an area of my life that was difficult for me. We didnt date that much, we talked for three months almost every day, dated seven times and every week we did a videocall. I really liked her because we were into the same things (books, series, music), our humor was very similar and we talked about a lot of things. She was a really chatty person and i really like that because im introvert. (Sorry if my english is not right, im from Argentina). With her it was the first time i really felt something in a kiss, for me it was like discovering something new. We went to different places from our city, didnt have much alone time besides once. I told her more at the end that i really liked her and she told me she did too. And for the first two months i feel like she was really into me and that she liked me. Never happened to me before. Next time after that, i told her to be exclusive and she told me she didn wanted and that she was seeing other people. That put me really uncomfortable and she told me she was uncomfortable too (because of my silence). I told her that i didnt know if keep dating, but then we talked and decided to go on. She told me she just wasnt ready, she was dating other people and she needed to know me more. But the month after that talk, she started to answer me less often. She responded after days sometimes. We dated one more time, and i noticed the chemistry was not the same. I think she was uncomfortable. We kissed and she talked about us like something that would continue. I told her to do something the next weekend and she told me that maybe but didn explain much more. So a week after, i ended things because noticed it wasnt the same. She told me that she was going to do it, but didnt know how. I had the feeling that she told me that only because i told her to stop dating, and that she wasnt going to end things, but she knew that i wanted something more so i dont know. Two months after that i replied a story on instagram and asked for a coffee. I didnt understand what happened so i wanted to talk and try. She told me that she had to think about it. A month after we talked and she told me that maybe in other moment. After that i told her that i didnt understand what happened when we dated and that i felt that she just played with me. She told me she felt things very intense and wasnt comfortable with that. I told her that i understand her, that it was my first time dating and having feelings for someone. Then i stopped following her on instagram and she unfollow me too. A year has passed and sometimes i keep thinking about that. For a time i was really depressed. I think its important to clarify that i lost my father and my best friend a little time before knowing her (covid) so i was vulnerable. I think my mistake was pressing too much, and when things were weird i just ended everything. I feel bad for how much affected me this girl that i barely meet.  I dated a lot of other people in this year, but didnt have chemistry with almost anyone. Sometimes i think about following her again one day, but i dont want to be a creep because we dont talk anymore so for now i just wont. Besides the people around me told me to just forget her. I just wanted to share the experience. Its normal that this affected me that much?",1,1750780264.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

He saved me at sixteen, a lost girl from the system, giving me a Manhattan apartment, Juilliard lessons, and paying for my dying sister Mia's severe cystic fibrosis care.
Mia was my world; Julian kept her alive, so I believed I loved him.
Then Julian met Chloe Raine, an indie folk singer.
He became obsessed, claiming it was a ""game"" to expose her ""integrity.""
""You're my queen. Always,"" he'd insist, but his eyes glowed with dangerous fascination, and a cold knot formed in my stomach.
He started neglecting me for Chloe.
One bitter Hamptons night, he dragged me onto our balcony in a rage.
When I refused to confess, he pulled out his phone, showing Mia's sterile room, her ventilator alarm blaring.
He calmly threatened her life, unless I confessed what I'd said.
My heart froze.
Mia, my only family, was a mere tool to him, her life leverage.
The man who swore to protect me was a monster.
I was his possession, my emotions irrelevant, my existence dictated by his whims and new obsessions.
I gave him the lie, but the humiliation was absolute.
My unplanned pr**nancy ended in miscarriage, which he blamed on my ""disobedience.""
But the ultimate breaking point was Mia.
He allowed his security to remove my dying sister's life support as I screamed.
Mia died. My baby was gone. My love for Julian died with them.
He was my destroyer. I had to escape.

Chapter 1
Ava Miller knew her life belonged to Julian Vance.

He found her at sixteen, lost in the group home system.

Julian gave her a life. A beautiful apartment in Manhattan, clothes, a future.

He paid for her violin lessons at Juilliard. She was talented.

More than anything, Julian paid for Mia.

Her younger sister, Mia, had severe cystic fibrosis.

Mia needed special machines, constant care, expensive dr**s.

Mia was Ava's world. Julian kept Mia alive.

So Ava loved Julian. Or she told herself she did. He was intense, his devotion a heavy blanket.

Julian liked grand gestures.

Last year, for her birthday, he rented out the entire top floor of the Museum of Modern Art for a private dinner.

Just them, the paintings, and a string quartet playing her favorite Bach pieces.

He flew in orchids from Hawaii for their anniversary because she once said she liked them.

His family, the Vances of Vance Holdings, old money New York real estate, hated her.

They saw a girl from nowhere, unfit for their dynasty.

Julian defied them. He told Ava, ""You are mine. They will accept it.""

His words made her feel safe, cherished, even if a part of her felt like a prized pet.

Then Julian met Chloe Raine.

It was at a SoHo art event, one of those loud, crowded things Julian insisted they attend.

Chloe was an indie folk singer. She wore thick, distinctive glasses for her amblyopia, an eye condition.

She sang about authenticity and struggle, her voice husky and compelling.

Julian, who owned half of SoHo, was fascinated.

He told Ava later, ""She's different. Real.""

Ava felt a cold knot in her stomach.

He started seeing Chloe.

""It's a game, Ava,"" Julian said, his eyes glittering. ""I want to see what it takes to buy her 'integrity.'You're my queen. Always.""

Ava tried to believe him. She had to. For Mia.

She saw less of Julian. He was always with Chloe, or talking about Chloe.

The ""game"" felt very real to Ava.

One night, Chloe Raine ""blocked"" Julian. No calls, no texts.

Julian came home to their Hamptons estate in a rage.

It was January, a bitter wind screaming off the Atlantic. Snow swirled.

""What did you say to her?"" he snarled, grabbing Ava's arm.

She was in a thin silk nightgown.

""Nothing, Julian. I haven't spoken to her.""

""Liar!""

He dragged her out onto the massive stone balcony overlooking the stormy ocean.

The wind cut through her nightgown like ice.

""Kneel,"" he commanded.

She hesitated. His face was stone. She knelt. The stone was frozen.

""Tell me what you said to Chloe.""

""I didn't say anything, Julian, I swear."" Ava shivered, her teeth chattering.

He pulled out his phone.

On the screen, she saw Mia. Mia in her sterile room at the private clinic Julian paid for.

Mia was sl**ping, a ventilator mask over her small face.

Then, a red light on the ventilator started flashing. An alarm beeped faintly through the phone's speaker.

""Her machine seems to be malfunctioning,"" Julian said, his voice calm, deadly.

""The on-call technician is, shall we say, delayed. Unless you tell me the truth.""

Ava's heart stopped. Mia couldn't breathe without that machine.

""Julian, please! She needs that machine!""

""Then tell me what you told Chloe to make her ignore me."" His voice was flat.

He didn't care about Mia, not really. Mia was just a tool.

""I... I told her to stay away from you,"" Ava choked out, the lie bitter on her tongue. ""I told her you were mine.""

She had to say something. Anything.

Julian smiled, a cold, satisfied smile.

""Good girl.""

He made a quick call. ""Fix the ventilator in Miss Miller's room. Now.""

He watched Ava for a moment, shivering on the frozen stone.

""You understand your place, Ava. Don't forget it again.""

He turned and went inside, leaving her there.

After a few minutes, a guard came and roughly pulled her to her feet, guiding her back into the warm house.

She couldn't feel her legs.

Ava lay in b*d, her body aching with cold, her heart colder.

Julian's past words of love echoed in her mind. ""You're irreplaceable, Ava.""

It was all a lie. She was replaceable. She was a possession.

She remembered seeing Chloe Raine once, very briefly, at that SoHo gallery.

Chloe had looked right through her, a small, knowing smile on her face.

Chloe projected an image of an artist who didn't care about money.

It was that ""authenticity"" that drew Julian in. He wanted to own it, to prove it could be bought.

Chloe was smart. She knew how to play him. Her distinctive glasses, her slightly clumsy way of moving because of her vision, it all added to her ""unique artist"" act.

A week after the balcony, Ava felt a familiar sickness in the mornings.

She took a test. Positive.

She was pr**nant.

A tiny, fragile hope flickered within her. Maybe a baby would change Julian. Make him the man he used to be, the man who rescued her.

She told him that evening.

Julian stared at her, his expression unreadable.

Then he said, ""A child is not in my plans for us right now, Ava.""

The hope died.

He was still obsessed with Chloe, who was now back in his favor after Ava's  ""confession."" 

Chloe was still playing hard to get, keeping Julian on a leash.

He complained to Ava constantly. ""Why is she still so distant? What else did you say?""

The arguments became more frequent. Julian was volatile, his moods swinging wildly.

One afternoon, he was yelling, pacing their living room.

""Chloe thinks I'm not serious enough! She thinks I'm still tied to you!""

""Julian, I'm pr**nant,"" Ava whispered, clutching her stomach.

""That's your problem, not mine!"" he shouted. ""You should have been more careful! You're always causing trouble, always disobedient!""

The stress, the constant fear, it was too much.

A sharp pain shot through Ava's abdomen. She gasped, doubling over.

She felt a warm gush between her legs.

She collapsed.

The last thing she saw was Julian staring down at her, his face annoyed.

When she woke up, she was in a small, unfamiliar room in a remote guesthouse on the far side of the Hamptons estate.

A grim-faced nurse told her she had miscarried.

The baby was gone.

Julian didn't come to see her.

The estate manager delivered a message. ""Mr. Vance says you are to stay here and reflect on your behavior. He says the miscarriage is your fault for not being obedient.""

Ava felt nothing.

No tears. No anger. Just a vast, cold emptiness.

The love she thought she had for Julian, the gratitude, the hope - it all turned to ash.

He had taken everything. Now, he had taken her child.

She lay there, staring at the ceiling.

Julian Vance was not her savior. He was her destroyer.

And she was utterly, completely alone.

Chapter 2
Ava woke up in a hospital b*d. Not the guesthouse. A real hospital.

Someone, probably the estate manager, must have decided she needed actual medical attention after the guesthouse.

A doctor came in, a kind-faced woman.

She confirmed the miscarriage. Complete.

""You need rest, Ms. Miller,"" the doctor said gently.

Ava nodded. Rest. As if rest could fix the gaping hole inside her.

She knew, with chilling certainty, that whatever was between her and Julian was over.

Dead. Like their baby.

The door opened. Julian walked in.

Chloe Raine was on his arm, clinging to him like a designer handbag.

Chloe's eyes, magnified by her quirky glasses, scanned Ava with open disdain.

""Julian, darling,"" Chloe said, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ""She looks terrible. Are you sure she didn't do this to herself for attention?""

Julian didn't even look at Ava. He st**ked Chloe's hair.

""Don't worry about her, my dear. She's just being dramatic.""

The casual cruelty of it stole Ava's breath. This was the man who once swore to protect her from everything.

Ava found her voice, a raw wh**per. ""Our baby, Julian.""

He finally looked at her. His eyes were cold, like chips of ice.

""There is no baby, Ava. You lost it. Your own fault. You were too emotional. Too disobedient.""

He said it so calmly. As if discussing the weather.

""My plans for us did not include a child yet. You knew that.""

He was asserting his control. Her body, her choices, her grief - all his to dictate.

Chloe sighed dramatically, pulling at Julian's arm.

""Julian, can we go? This place is depressing. And she's making me uncomfortable.""

Chloe's ""authentic artist"" persona was nowhere to be seen.

Here, in private, she was just a mean girl enjoying her power.

Julian turned his attention back to Chloe, instantly solicitous.

""Of course, my love."" He glanced back at Ava.

""Apologize to Chloe,"" he ordered.

Ava stared at him. ""Apologize? For what?""

""For upsetting her. For making her feel uncomfortable with your... situation.""

He took a step closer. ""Don't make me ask again, Ava. You know I don't like to repeat myself.""

His voice was soft, but the threat was clear. He would use force. He had before.

Ava felt a cold wave of despair wash over her.

She was trapped. Beaten.

Two of Julian's security guards, always lurking nearby, stepped into the room.

They flanked her bed.

She looked at Julian's implacable face, then at Chloe's smug one.

""I'm... sorry,"" Ava whispered, the words like acid in her mouth.

She closed her eyes. She felt a small, sharp pain in her palm.

She had clenched her fist so hard her nails had broken the skin.

A tiny, symbolic act of defiance only she would know.

Julian smiled, satisfied. He turned to Chloe. ""See, my dear? All sorted.""

Then, he did something that shattered the last piece of Ava's broken heart.

""Chloe,"" he said, taking her hand. ""I've been thinking. This situation with Ava... it's messy. Unbecoming.""

He looked directly at Ava, his eyes devoid of any emotion.

""I'm divorcing her. I'll have my lawyers draw up the papers. Then, Chloe, we can be together properly. No more complications.""

Ava felt like she'd been punched in the gut. Divorce. He was discarding her.

Like a broken toy.

Chloe preened, a triumphant little smile playing on her lips.

She glanced at Ava, a flicker of pure malice in her eyes behind the stylish glasses.

Julian, besotted, saw nothing.

A moment later, a man in a sharp suit entered. Julian's personal lawyer, Mr. Henderson.

He carried a briefcase.

""Mr. Vance,"" Henderson said, nodding. He didn't look at Ava.

""The papers, Henderson,"" Julian said.

Henderson opened the briefcase and produced a sheaf of documents.

He placed them on Ava's bedside table.

""Mrs. Vance... soon to be Ms. Miller,"" Henderson said, his voice neutral. ""These are the divorce papers. Mr. Vance is prepared to be very generous. A substantial settlement. He also wishes to assure you that... in time... perhaps some form of reconciliation regarding your sister's care might be possible, depending on your... cooperation.""

A lie. A manipulation. Keep her hoping, keep her compliant.

The money meant nothing. Mia's care was the only thing that mattered. And he was dangling it.

Ava looked at the papers. Then at Julian, his arm around Chloe.

The love she had felt, the hope, the fear - it was all gone.

Replaced by a vast, cold emptiness.

""Fine,"" Ava said, her voice surprisingly steady. ""I'll sign.""

She had nothing left to lose. Her baby was gone. Her love was dead.

Her sister was still a pawn, but maybe, just maybe, escape was possible.

She would sign his papers. And then she would disappear.

Chapter 3
Julian wasted no time.

The next day, tabloids were full of pictures of Julian Vance and Chloe Raine.

""Billionaire Heir Finds True Love with Indie Songstress!"" one headline screamed.

Chloe, in the photos, looked ethereal, her quirky glasses glinting, a guitar slung over her shoulder.

Julian beamed, looking utterly smitten.

He was lavishing Chloe with the same extravagant attention he once gave Ava.

A custom-built recording studio. Prime performance slots at exclusive clubs he owned. Whispers of a record deal with a major label he had influence over.

It was Ava's story, replayed with a new leading lady.

Ava was back in the Manhattan penthouse, a prisoner in her gilded cage.

The divorce papers sat on her nightstand. She hadn't signed them yet. Not until she had a plan.

She watched the news reports, scrolled through the fawning articles online.

Each picture of Julian and Chloe was a fresh stab of... not pain. Disillusionment.

His ""love"" was a template, easily transferred.

She was nothing special. She never had been.

One afternoon, she slipped out. The guards Julian had posted were lax, probably assuming she was too broken to go anywhere.

She took a cab to the private clinic where Mia lived.

Mia was awake, her small face pale, but her eyes lit up when she saw Ava.

""Ava!""

Ava hugged her tightly, breathing in the familiar scent of antiseptic and Mia.

""I missed you,"" Mia whispered, her breathing a little raspy.

""I missed you too, sweetie.""

Ava sat by Mia's b*d, holding her hand. She didn't tell Mia about the baby. Or the divorce.

She just talked about music, about a new piece she was learning on the violin.

""I'm going away for a while, Mia,"" Ava said softly, after a long silence. ""But I'll make sure you're taken care of. Always.""

Mia looked worried. ""Where are you going?""

""Somewhere quiet. To get better."" Ava forced a smile. ""I love you more than anything, Mia.""

""I love you too, Ava.""

Leaving Mia was the hardest thing Ava had ever done. Harder than losing the baby. Harder than Julian's cruelty.

Mia was her reason for living. But staying meant condemning them both to Julian's whims.

Back at the penthouse, Ava began to dismantle her life.

She packed away the designer clothes Julian had bought her, the expensive jewelry.

She would sell them. She needed money. Real money, not Julian's ""generous settlement"" that came with strings.

She found a small, velvet box. Inside were the simple, handmade gifts she'd given Julian over the years.

A painted rock from their first trip to the beach. A bookmark she'd cross-stitched. A small, clay bird she'd sculpted.

Worthless trinkets to him now. To her, they were remnants of a love she'd believed in.

She took them to the incinerator chute in the service hallway.

One by one, she dropped them in. Watching them disappear.

Burning her past.

She was about to drop the last item, the clay bird, when she heard the elevator doors open.

Julian. And Chloe.

They saw her by the incinerator.

Julian frowned. ""What are you doing?""

Chloe's eyes narrowed, a smirk playing on her lips.

""Just getting rid of some old things,"" Ava said, her voice flat.

Julian's gaze fell on the clay bird in her hand. He didn't recognize it. Or didn't care.

""Good,"" he said. ""Chloe needs a new necklace. The Vance diamonds. The one my mother wore. For the primary Vance woman. Go get it.""

The primary Vance woman. That used to be her.

Ava felt a flicker of something, a ghost of pain. She crushed it.

She went to the vault, retrieved the heavy, ornate diamond necklace.

She handed it to Julian. He immediately turned to drape it around Chloe's neck.

Chloe followed Ava as she walked back towards her bedroom.

""He never really loved you, you know,"" Chloe hissed, her voice low and venomous, the ""authentic artist"" mask gone.

""You were just a placeholder. A charity case.""

Ava didn't respond. She kept walking.

Chloe grabbed her arm, spinning her around.

""That necklace looks good on me, don't you think?"" Chloe taunted, fingering the diamonds.

Then, Chloe's eyes glittered with a sudden, vicious idea.

""Oops!"" Chloe exclaimed, her hand ""slipping.""

The priceless Vance diamond necklace clattered to the marble floor. Several large diamonds skittered away. It looked like one of the main clasps had broken.

Before Ava could react, Chloe shoved her. Hard.

Ava stumbled backward, lost her footing at the top of a short flight of three marble stairs leading down into the sunken living room.

She cried out, tumbling down, her head cracking against the sharp edge of a marble coffee table.

Pain exploded in her skull.

Chloe let out a piercing scream. She clawed at her own arm, drawing bl**d with her fingernails.

""She attacked me! Julian, Ava attacked me! She broke the necklace and pushed me!""

Julian rushed in, his face a mask of fury.

He saw Chloe, ""bleeding"" and ""crying."" He saw Ava on the floor, dazed, the shattered remnants of the necklace nearby.

He didn't ask questions. He never did.

""You b**ch!"" he roared at Ava. ""You hurt Chloe! You always cause trouble!""

He grabbed Ava by the hair, yanking her to her feet.

""Security!"" he bellowed.

Two guards appeared instantly.

""Teach her a lesson,"" Julian snarled, his eyes blazing. ""Make her understand what happens when she hurts what's mine.""

The guards dragged Ava away, ignoring her dazed protests.

Chloe watched, a triumphant, cruel smile on her face.

Julian put his arm around Chloe, comforting her. ""It's okay, my love. I'll take care of her.""

Ava heard Chloe's soft, satisfied sigh as the guards hauled her towards a back room.

The beating was brutal. Precise. Meant to hurt, to terrify, but not to leave marks that would be too obvious. Julian was always careful about appearances.

Ava curled into a ball, protecting her head, enduring.

Each blow was a reminder. She was nothing. Less than nothing.

Julian's love was a weapon. And Chloe was now the one wielding it.

Chapter 4
Ava woke up on the floor of a storage room. Her body screamed with pain.

Her head throbbed where it had hit the table, and a dull ache pulsed through her ribs.

Julian stood over her, his face cold and impassive.

""Get up,"" he said. ""Chloe is still upset. You need to make it right.""

Make it right. After he'd had her beaten.

Ava slowly, painfully, pushed herself up. Every movement was agony.

""The Vance Foundation gala is tonight,"" Julian continued, as if nothing had happened. ""Chloe is my guest of honor. You will attend. You will perform.""

Perform. Like a trained animal.

""You will play something appropriate. Something for Chloe. To show your remorse.""

He dictated the piece. A complex, mournful melody by Paganini he knew she found difficult.

He even chose her dress. A flimsy, pale gown, something that would make her look washed out and vulnerable under the harsh lights of the gala. It was several seasons old, something she hadn't worn since her early days with him. A deliberate humiliation.

The gala was a glittering a**air, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Manhattan's elite were all there, dripping in jewels and designer clothes.

Ava arrived alone, as Julian had instructed.

She walked in, a ghost in her pale dress, her violin case clutched in her hand.

The whispers started immediately.

""Isn't that Ava Miller? What's she doing here?""

""I thought Julian Vance dumped her for that singer, Chloe Raine.""

""She looks awful. So pale.""

Ava kept her head high, ignoring them. She remembered a time when Julian would have destroyed anyone who dared to wh**per about her.

He used to be so protective. He'd once publicly humiliated a society columnist who'd made a snide remark about Ava's background.

Now, he was the source of her humiliation.

Julian and Chloe made their grand entrance.

Chloe was radiant in a vibrant, custom-made gown, the (repaired) Vance diamond necklace sparkling at her throat. She looked every inch the new queen.

Julian was attentive, possessive, his eyes only for her.

They walked past Ava without a glance.

The performance was scheduled for after dinner.

Ava sat alone at a small, isolated table near the service entrance.

She ate nothing. Drank nothing.

She just waited.

When the time came, she walked onto the small stage.

The spotlight blinded her. She could feel hundreds of eyes on her.

She saw Julian and Chloe at the main table, Chloe whispering something in Julian's ear, a smug smile on her face.

Ava raised her violin.

She didn't play the Paganini.

Instead, she played a piece she had composed herself. A lament.

It was filled with sorrow, with loss, with a quiet, aching despair.

It was a song for her lost baby. A song for her lost self.

The music flowed, raw and emotional.

She closed her eyes, pouring all her pain into the notes.

When she finished, there was a stunned silence.

Then, scattered, hesitant applause.

She saw Julian's face. He looked uncomfortable. Almost... pained?

It was a fleeting expression. Gone as quickly as it appeared.

Chloe stood up.

""Well,"" Chloe said, her voice carrying through the suddenly quiet hall. ""That was... certainly something.""

She walked towards the stage, Julian a step behind her.

""A bit depressing for a gala, don't you think?"" Chloe said, addressing the audience, but her eyes were fixed on Ava.

""Trying to get sympathy, are we, Ava? Playing the victim?""

Ava said nothing.

Chloe turned to Julian, pouting. ""Julian, darling, I don't like this music. It's bringing down the mood. Make her play something cheerful.""

She was openly challenging him, testing her power.

The crowd watched, fascinated.

Julian looked from Chloe to Ava, a muscle twitching in his jaw.

He indulged Chloe. He always indulged his latest obsession.

""Ava,"" he said, his voice tight. ""Play something else. Something Chloe likes.""

Ava lowered her violin.

She looked at Julian, at the man who had systematically destroyed her.

And she finally understood. There was nothing left to salvage. No hope. No future with him.

Only escape.

\---

The realization hits you like an oblivious driver hits an unsupervised child. Emerges the question, who is the sorry soul cast with the burden behind the demise of innocent, pure, fresh life. Surely, it couldn‚Äôt be the driver, who had no way of knowing that a small body would spontaneously run onto the road in chase of a ball, vibrantly striped yellow and red against the pavement. What about the parents, shouldn‚Äôt they have been paying close attention to their child, or rejecting his endless pleads to go play outside? No, you can‚Äôt blame the parents. They were overwhelmed with the jobs that house and feed them on top of the bills, the taxes, the judgment, the hassling. Too much was on their backs for it to be their fault. Afterall, it might just be their first time living too. Maybe it‚Äôs the child‚Äôs own doing, who absentmindedly ran onto the street, forgetting to look left and right like they‚Äôre taught in preschool or those obnoxious television programs. Of course not, children are just mere masses of flesh who weren‚Äôt give enough time to comprehend that they are closer to death by the second, one way or another. Brains limited to simplicity. In those 24.3 seconds, that ball was all his universe was, slowly drifting away from him.¬†*Chase the ball, that is your purpose, that is all that matters.*¬†

Was it the teenage cashier at the grocery store who offishly sold the ball to the boy‚Äôs mother? Was it the pale-skinned European factory worker who painted the red and yellow stripes onto it? This is a stupid train of thought. No matter who or what is to blame, the accident was fatal. Life was deprived of a mind yet to develop, while those who developed long ago were left with feelings of misery and mourning that would eat them up until every last shred of skin was decayed beneath 6 feet of dirt. But it‚Äôs all God‚Äôs plan, right? Maybe we should count the boy lucky.¬†

The human brain was cursed with curiosity, questions that will never be answered. If God exists, who is¬†*his*¬†Lord? If God exists, why didn‚Äôt he just tell us? Supposedly he left traces of existence, messages sent to the few chosen. That way, only those of true faith will join him in paradise. But if that‚Äôs the case, why did he stop? We don‚Äôt see Prophets in this day and age. Perhaps holy history is made up of hallucinations, perhaps the excruciating heat of Mecca led to deranged visions, and the unfortunate Moroccan man was just another tragic example of the human capacity to hate. Hate. It can‚Äôt exist without love/ Everyone who hates must love, even if it‚Äôs small and insignificant.¬†

The idea that religion is merely a coping mechanism is not revolutionary nor that uncommon, so why do I feel so guilty for thinking outside the box? If you have faith that the box is salvage, then once you take your final breath, there is nothing to lose if you were wrong the entire time. And the cat inside the box, well she's both dead and alive until you open it. I always believed that thought experiment was stupid, until I realized that‚Äôs the whole point. Your observation isn‚Äôt in line with the forces of nature, especially your uncertainty. Perhaps the men of our society are made up of Judge Holdens, who hate the idea that something may exist without their knowledge.¬†

I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve rambled as per usual. I won‚Äôt tell you my name, simply because I don‚Äôt see how that would help fulfill my purpose. My purpose is to tell you a story. This is the story of how the red and yellow striped ball was never what we thought it was. The smell of freshly cut green grass, the blood-stained sunset dimming the clouds, the shining skin navy blue truck becoming indented, were all the beginning of our eternal punishment. Don‚Äôt search for tiny holes of white light, for they slowly started to close up. We can not escape this. But for some reason, amidst our putrescence, I see you beside me. You‚Äôve always looked after me, your figure is hard to make out, like a slight blur in the mirror. Infinity is lost, so with the time we have left, I suppose we‚Äôre all owed a bit of an explanation, especially you.¬†

November 28th, 1996. ‚ÄúThe Eyes of Providence.‚Äù That‚Äôs what they called themselves. They lived in rural Utah, a great big farm they built for themselves. It was a beautiful scene, really, at least from what the pictures said. The sky was always a bondi blue, the sun created a peaceful yellow blanket of life against grass and skin. They kept animals, these big brown cows, white horses with long silky manes, dogs who would cool themselves in the moist soil, and butterflies. Pink, orange, and purple butterflies with black lines creating floral patterns in their wings and white dots like stars in the midnight sky. The farm building was deep red, like the ones you see in cartoons or eyesight tests. The EoP, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll refer to them as from here. The men had shoulder length hair and beards like brown sheep‚Äôs wool, they wore white robes that fell over their bodies like creamer into coffee. The women also wore white dresses, not the wedding type, but with gloves and bonnets and veil-like fabric that tinted their faces the color of clay. They were all always smiling, and it wasn‚Äôt the forced kind as if they were being held against their will. Their expressions were genuine, of those who felt the pure love of their supposed divine Father.¬†

‚ÄúAnd now for our next segment we strongly advise viewer discretion and especially if there are any children present. As of the early morning, November 29th, 1996, the infamous cult known at The Eyes of Providence in rural Utah have partaken in a mass suicide. The farmhouse in which the one-hundred-and-thirty-five members resided in was intentionally set ablaze.‚Äù¬†

*And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am, John 14:3*¬†

Their leader was Gideon Freeman, a charming man who saw God in all his glory, and his filth. They called him Father Freeman, he was raised in an atheist household. A drunk father, an emotionally absent mother, siblings who he never heard from again after highschool, your typical American white-trash family. When Gideon was a young boy, he was hit by a truck outside of their suburban home. He spent 5 months in a coma, and when he finally came to he was never quite the same. This was the start of what his teachers would label ‚Äútemper-tantrums,‚Äù but I‚Äôd rather refer to them as what they were: violent outbreaks. He loved to draw, but his pieces weren‚Äôt lazy crayola dinosaurs and rocketships, they were visual representations of Hell itself. People were engulfed in flames, screaming in sheer agony, crying for their mothers to come pull them out of this never-ending torture as their flesh became a jet-black char. When asked about these drawing, Gideon always assured his horrified classmates that they deserved to be there, the pain was only a result of ignorance. What really worried his teachers, though, was that he took it upon himself to handle the wrongdoings of his peers. Thomas Peterson was quite the energetic boy, he loved planes, helicopters, trucks, anything that would allow someone to travel without using their own two feet. One day, Thomas rammed his plastic G.I. Joe into Gideon‚Äôs fanciful church made from wooden blocks. All in good fun‚Ä¶ is what Thomas thought. Gideon pinned him to the ground and jammed a freshly sharpened pencil into his left eye, for little Thomas had failed to observe and respect the grounds of his neighbor. This is one of many acts of discipline the six-year-old Gideon had committed, from pulling off fingernails with toy tweezers to constructing fake nooses out of licorice (fortunately, the rope broke when he tried to hang Fatima Bashar off of the monkey bars). His parents always excused his behavior as just a boy playing rough, he did grow up with three brothers after all.

So when the news came out about the mass suicide, investigators speculated that it was Father Freeman's doing. His insatiable thirst for divine discipline had taken over and he felt as if his community had failed God's test. Maybe that was part of the reason, but my ideas involve a concept that is much bigger than all of us. To put it simply, they'll be back. They'll be back, and this time we're coming with them. Every single one of us. So don't bother hiding, don't bother fighting, don't even pray, because you'll only make things worse. The Day of Judgement is among us, and we've burned down the Garden of Eden.

1ljen79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1ljen79/feeling_subtly_manipulated_conflicting_feelings/,Feeling subtly manipulated / Conflicting feelings," *Arg... here we go*

**tldr:** **female friend changes her behaviour towards me (male) in the span of a month** **since breaking up with his boyfriend. I tried to do less hobby activities with her because of schedule and starting to burn out of doing the same and instead I get a 'are you avoiding me?' Am I being petty getting annoyed given her situation or was she trying to manipulate me?**

Full story with context:

I'm a Male, mid 30s, bisexual, single, hispanic... and I love salsa dancing. And this post is about how I feel about my friend, who I have known for 8 years, female mid 30s, straight & hispanic too, currently going through a break up and unemployed (retraining/trying a career change).

Back in November 2024, I started recovering from an illness that took me out for 3 months. I lost clients, work was very low... basically had to rebuild my life back up again. Always tried to see the positive side and I did things that I could manage while recovering. My friend and I met to practice salsa dancing, at least once a week at her place. This was just for fun, to learn and also it helps burning fat. She was engaged back then and her partner is also a friend of mine. We started this before I had that illness and from the get go I checked if both of them were ok with the salsa practice (you know some people see dancing as being very sexual etc. but honestly, it is not sexual at all. It is a good workout and we learnt a new style of salsa during that time). So... It's November, I have not much work so I am free to practice as much as twice a week and go to socials etc., while I build my life back up.

Forward to 2025 New Year, my friend tells me that her and her partner are having issues. I listen to some of it, but I stop her before it gets intimate because his partner is also my friend and I don't want to get involved in anything. At that point I notice she is trying to do a lot of activities outside to avoid being in the house and it feels like a coping mechanism. I give her lifts to the socials and at that point she has fully latched on to me for social dances, going outs, etc. So basically I am going to every dance social with my female friend ... which is nice to share an activity with... but one of the reasons I joined this (before her) was to meet more people and why not to be open to meet potential relationships in a fun and natural way (instead of dating apps, which I hate).

March 2025, they announce to our group of friends that they are splitting up. Things start getting weird. At that point I have already re-built my life back up again, I'm working full time and I feel like I am doing too much salsa... it's fun, but it's too much, I feel like I'm neglecting other activities in my life.

So one day I say to her, next week we take a break and the one after we do only one session please. And I get this:

***- ''I feel that you are avoiding me''.***

In that moment I am a bit shocked, I think wtf? the day she hits me with that I literally finished work, ate, had a coffee and went straight to her house for practice. 0 spare time.

So I explain myself... I'm busy, I wanna do other hobbies, maybe do a bit less of this, etc. I drive home feeling like... why did I have to explain myself? This is a hobby, we don't have a contract or anything, it's for fun. I start feeling that she has made me an integral part of her routine and that she is expecting me to provide 'fun' for her to take her mind off her difficult situation. She always latches on to me to any social plans, even says things like 'I like that you do all the socialising so I don't have to' because she is shy and insecure.

At that point I don't want to be mean to her given her situation so I let that one go.

The next weeks from the day they announced their break up... I get the following highlights:

*- You are avoiding me (again)*

*- Don't abandon me*

*- You danced that song with that lady, you could have saved it for me.*

*- If you are going to invite me to a plan, you need to clearly invite me instead of 'come if you fancy this'...*

*- How does it feel that everyone in the scene likes you?*

\- Messages every day about random stuff without any purpose (a photo of a landscape... and stuff like that)

\- I asked her (genuinely) if she saw a chance of going back with her partner who is a decent man, supportive, really good person and a mate. Instead she tells me off, tells me that other people have asked her the same, that please we all stop asking because it's so annoying... bla bla bla....

I start feeling this is scalating super quick in just a few weeks and that I need to take some action because she is changing the friendship dinamic and honestly, it **is** getting awkward. Also I start feeling that.... from now on... I... kinda want to start avoiding her.... which makes me feel bad, because I value her as a friend but that feeling is there.

Then mid April I went abroad for a couple weeks and I get:

*- 'Don't feel weird about this but... I miss you a lot.. you're very important to me... .*

At that point I videocall her and tell her straight away that I feel she has changed the way we have always been friends, that I understand that she is going through a very rough time but that I do not talk with my female friends like that and that it makes me uncomfortable. She says she understands, that she values me a lot and that respects my boundaries so won't do it again. She adds that she felt that in November back when I was recovering from my illness I texted her more. I say to her this is true and I apologise if she took that with the wrong impression. She says it's fine. Also I say to her I want to start going to every dance social on my own without sharing a lift because seriously I think half of my city think we are a couple and because I want to still be open to meet more people and who knows, meeting someone special.. She says that that is really sad but respects it.

I hang up and then I think, what wrong impression did I give in November? Messages were mutual, and my messages ALWAYS had a purpose: to meet (time/place), a video to learn a new move in practice, or something related to that.

I leave it at that and I think it was a good chat with her to clear things up.

However I feel I am still ruminating this too much and I shouldn't..... I need to move on and close this.

Throughout all this I felt the following:

\- was she trying to manipulate me? Was she projecting her insecurities onto me?

\- Am I the asshole for distancing myself a bit? (I still see her and it's ok, she does not text every day which is great)

\- Am I the asshole for feeling this friendship has run its course? I feel this is all very drama/ high school. Given our age... I like living in peace and I don't like her disturbing my peace. But I don't want to build up more resentment. I guess... I just don't have many people to talk to about this and I don't want to involve our common friends.

\- I think I should have stopped things at the first comment I didn't like?

\- We haven't said anything about doing the salsa sessions again. I am full on with work atm but to be honest... I kind of don't want to do them either. If she proposes it... I think I will probably say nop. I want to enjoy just socials, connect with people through dance and music.

\- Is this all just incredibly petty? Arg... drama.....

Want to exchange fandoms, do you need a character written? 


My character is a 300+ year old witch named Sarah Alder. She's from the Motherland Fort Salem series. Go check out the show!

She built America. In her early timeline witches run the army and Sarah Alder is the General. Think of her as the female version of George Washington.

As stoic, strict, and gruff as she can be she has a sense of humor and has an appreciation for life. She can be goofy with the right people

She loves coffee, books, and may dabble in some unhealthy habits. (reckless behavior and women) to cope. with her long life and loneliness. She also paints, plays piano, loves the outdoors, gardening, motorcycles and did | mention coffee? Working with the Fosterlings, the army's orphaned children brings her a great amount of joy. 

Her youth is in part to her Biddies. Women who dedicated their lives to Sarah in order to keep her alive. This was through an agreement over a piece of land to which she was taken advantage over.

Alder's one true weakness is Tally Craven, however my character has the pov, it's not in the cards for her to be happy. She's always a little lonely and sad.

This is where you come in. I'm looking for a writer to eventually build a relationship between Tally and Sarah. If they remain platonic, I'm fine with that too. 

If you want to write another character in this verse or an oc, come on over and let's brainstorm. 

All tropes are welcome. 

Enemies to lovers
Strangers, friends, lovers 
Angst 
Fluff 
Fantasy
Human and witch fall in love 
Time period pieces
Artist and model 
Medieval 
Greek/Roman timelines

Throw an idea at me. Our writing doesn't only have to take place in the world previously created. I love au's and would welcome modern time writing for her. She can be written without being a witch.

I'm detailed, literate, and prefer paragraph writing. No one liner responses unless it's banter for simple fun. I love world building, researching for stories, using gifs, custom commissions, and aesthetics to add depth to a story. I tag those I write with to develop chemistry and hope you're all right with doing the same. 

21+ I don't expect you to reply every single day. I do enjoy ooc chat for plotting, ""fangirling"" and headcanons. 


I'm CST time zone. I'm intermittently available during the day to write replies or answer messages.

The Of Dice and Dens Podcast is proud to announce that we are once again putting on our three day online streaming marathon of tabletop gaming one-shots to help raise money for Boise‚Äôs [Simply Cats](https://simplycats.org/), a cage free, no-kill cat shelter. The online streaming event will be held June 27-29, from 12pm to 8pm Mountain time.

Initially conjured up in 2020 during the shutdown, the Meowrathon started as a half-baked idea to run a live-streamed one-shot adventure to supplement Simply Cats‚Äô donations through the statewide crowd-funding event, Idaho Gives. Within a week it had grown into a [two-day extravaganza of 6 games](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cto3DV0f-w-w-vBTT54xupOPM3c3aIZ). We were joined by folks not only from all over the country, but from all over the world! We were also able to entice [Captain Shaw himself, Todd Stashwick](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Stashwick) to join us! We were able to raise $1,550 to help cats and kittens find homes.

Thanks to the success and fun of the first year, we decided to turn it into a yearly event, only bigger, moving to three days. With more time to plan we were able to have a wider variety of games and more Idaho locals to play with. Since then we‚Äôve had lots of great folks help us out. Todd came back and brought a bunch of his friends with him, including David Blue and Alicia Marie! Our very own Jason Klamm also managed to wrangle James Urbaniak and Riley Silverman to join us in a game. In the last few years we‚Äôve raised over $5,500 for Simply Cats.

##Event Details

The Of Dice and Dens Podcast is proud to announce that we are once again putting on our three day online streaming marathon of tabletop gaming one-shots to help raise money for Boise‚Äôs [Simply Cats](https://simplycats.org/), a cage free, no-kill cat shelter. The online streaming event will be held June 27-29, from 12pm to 8pm Mountain time.

Initially conjured up in 2020 during the shutdown, the Meowrathon started as a half-baked idea to run a live-streamed one-shot adventure to supplement Simply Cats‚Äô donations through the statewide crowd-funding event, Idaho Gives. Within a week it had grown into a [two-day extravaganza of 6 games](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9cto3DV0f-w-w-vBTT54xupOPM3c3aIZ). We were joined by folks not only from all over the country, but from all over the world! We were also able to entice [Captain Shaw himself, Todd Stashwick](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Stashwick) to join us! We were able to raise $1,550 to help cats and kittens find homes.

Thanks to the success and fun of the first year, we decided to turn it into a yearly event, only bigger, moving to three days. With more time to plan we were able to have a wider variety of games and more Idaho locals to play with. Since then we‚Äôve had lots of great folks help us out. Todd came back and brought a bunch of his friends with him, including David Blue and Alicia Marie! Our very own Jason Klamm also managed to wrangle James Urbaniak and Riley Silverman to join us in a game. In the last few years we‚Äôve raised over $5,500 for Simply Cats.

If you or someone you know would be interested in participating, either as a player or game host, or if you just want to watch along please feel free to visit https://Meowrathon.com.

[Of Dice and Dens](https://odndpodcast.com/) is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game Podcast that focuses on showcasing third party content by smaller / independent creators. Our members are based out of Washington, Idaho, and Michigan. We all own and love cats.

My character is a 300+ year old witch named Sarah Alder. She's from the Motherland Fort Salem series. Go check out the show!

She built America. In her timeline witches rur the army and Sarah Alder is the General. Think of her as the female version of George Washington.

As stoic, strict, and gruff as she can be she has a sense of humor and has an appreciation for life. She can be goofy with the right people

She loves coffee, books, whiskey, and may begin dabbling in some unhealthy habits. (a little too much whiskey and women) to cope. with her long life and loneliness. She also paints, plays piano, loves the outdoors, gardening, motorcycles and did | mention coffee?

Working with the Fosterlings, the army's orphaned children brings her a great amount of joy. 

Her youth is in part to her Biddies. Women who dedicated their lives to Sarah in order to keep her alive. She was conscripted by the early US government and bound through an agreement over a piece of land to which she was taken advantage over.

Alder's one true weakness is Tally Craven, however my character has the pov, it's not in the cards for her to be happy. She's always a little lonely and sad.

This is where you come in. I'm looking for a writer to eventually build a relationship between Tally and Sarah. If they remain platonic, I'm fine with that too. 

If you want to write another character in this verse or an oc, come on over and let's brainstorm. 

All tropes are welcome. 

Enemies to lovers
Strangers, friends, lovers 
Angst 
Fluff 
Fantasy
Human and witch fall in love 
Time period pieces

Throw an idea at me
Our writing doesn't only have to take place in the world previously created. I love au's and would welcome modern time writing for her. She can be written without being a witch.

I'm detailed, literate, and prefer paragraph writing. No one liner responses unless it's banter for simple fun. I love world building, researching for stories, using gifs, custom commissions, and aesthetics to add depth to a story. I tag those I write with to develop chemistry and hope you're all right with doing the same. 

21+ For adult themes and references to alcohol. I don't expect you to reply every single day. I do enjoy ooc chat for plotting, ""fangirling"" and headcanons. 


I'm CST time zone. I'm intermittently available during the day to write replies or answer messages. 

My platform of choice is Facebook due to allowing organization of ideas and posting pictures in albums. 

Want more info send let's chat and create.

1lje3zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lje3zb/how_do_i_deal_with_my_brother/,How do I deal with my brother,"For context, I am 38, female and I have schizoaffective disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). I am high functioning, and that means I am able to hold down a job, even though it means a remote one). I work as a research assistant at a university from home most of the time, and I make minimum wage. 

I live with my father (77 this year), brother (34) and my cousin and his wife (both in their thirties) in my dad's bungalow. We used to be fairly well-off because of my dad's job as a senior manager, but he has retired for more than 10 years and he relies on his employment retirement funds, which is shrinking fast because of his lack of financial sense.

For example, last year, when he had a bad infection, he opted to be warded at a first class hospital, and at the most expensive ward there. For just 5 days of being warned, he was charged around 18, 000 and he has only managed to settle that payment through credit card recently. He also doesn't have insurance and refuses to get one.

Meanwhile, my brother has learning problems. His IQ is pretty low. Because of that, he was unable to obtain his high school certificate, which makes it hard for him to apply for a job. He has only worked one job before, and that was more than a decade ago.

It gave him a sense of fulfilment, but he quit because he was bullied by a colleague. Ever since, he has been giving all sorts of excuses not to find a job. There are some jobs that take people with no high school certificate here in Malaysia, and yet he is stubborn. 

All he does is play video games all night, violently cursing while he is at it and in the morning he would sleep all day. His level of hygiene is pretty bad. He has stained teeth, uncut nails, and bad body ordor. He rarely showers despite our country's tropical climate.

Our dad always complains about him but he refuses to listen. Our dad has also even said that he would support my brother if he sets up a small food business (my brother is a good cook).

Sometimes my brother would help around the house like bring our clothes to the dobi, and do the grocery run (he has a driver's license), but that's it. I suspect he has depression, but he says no to my suggestion for him to see a counsellor. 

Our mom (who was divorced from our dad) recently passed away and my brother has been struggling a lot  with her demise because they were very close. 

My mom also did her best to encourage my brother to work but he refuses. My therapist (whom I see twice a month) says that my brother fears going into new things and is a scattered personality. IMO, my brother's limited intellectual capability makes him unable to plan and strategise. He lives his life without a proper plan. 

On top of that, he is violent. He once threatened to beat up my dad and he has also threatened to beat me up a few times. I told my mom about it before her demise but she did not rebuke him. My relationship with my mom was always strained, and this strained our relationship further.

I am scared I might be beaten up one day. My dad is a really weak personality and is unable to tell him off. I asked him why he never defended me when my brother threatened to hit me, and he gave a lame excuse.

I try my best to distract myself so I don't feel fearful but when I think too much about it, I feel like I might lose my mind completely. I am unable to move out of the house because of my low pay and my mental health issues, and frankly I don't want to because the house is jointly owned by dad, me and my brother.

I also don't want to report my brother to the police because I am scared what would happen to him, and plus my dad would be so angry with me.

Right now, I am trying my best to live my life as best as possible. I work hard, exercise, take my meds, see my therapist, exercise, watch movies to fill my time, meet up with friends, etc etc. 

I am scared when my dad dies and I would need to take care of my brother. There is also the possibility of me relapsing again. I was warded many times before this due to immense stress from work and family. I don't want to end up homeless or destitute, or institutionalised. I really feel overwhelmed.

I am ok with helping my brother if he wasn't such an asshole. I even sometimes give him a bit of money.

But overall, he is manipulative and socially charismatic. He helps people outside (like our late mother's former helper by treating her and her kids to coffee when he has money) but treats our dad and me like shit.

I am at a loss to what to do. How should I go on when my life seems so bleak.",1,1750778872.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1ljdx5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhasmophobiaGame/comments/1ljdx5x/the_chronicle_update_isfrustrating/,The Chronicle update is‚Ä¶frustrating,"If you‚Äôre like me, you almost always pursue a perfect hunt. 

That has become a much more time-consuming process. Especially if you‚Äôre playing solo, with the new introduction and requirement to gather 5 unique photos, 5 unique videos and 3 unique sound recordings.

That‚Äôs all fine. I‚Äôm fine with the update forcing you to slow down and take your time a bit more.

What I‚Äôm *NOT* fine with is spending way longer on a perfect hunt and suddenly having the perfect ruined by means entirely outside of my control. 

Let me paint you a picture‚Ä¶

You‚Äôve figured out the ghost type, gotten the bone, gotten 5 unique photos, 3 unique videos and 3 unique sound recordings. You‚Äôve used 2/3 of your media deletes. One of your unique videos is a thrown object.

Your ghost is on dots and you need a video of it. It‚Äôs only appearing briefly, it‚Äôs not feasible to try and record after it appears, so you stand and wait for it to walk through dots again while you‚Äôre holding the record button down.

Suddenly, the ghost decides to toss a coffee mug through your video and a picture falls off the wall nearby, simultaneously. 

Against your wishes, your video camera instantly saves two thrown object videos. But you already had one, so they‚Äôre not unique. You now have two videos to delete‚Ä¶ but wait, you already used up two of your deletes while standing there holding the record button down on your sound recorder waiting for the ghost to do its mist-orb breathy sound again but instead you accidentally captured a second burned crucifix sound.

Screw your perfect hunt. Sorry you spent all that time juggling three new media requirements while trying to play solo! 


Seriously, what is this crap? Following the update and running the challenge mode, I found myself quitting the game after only a couple contracts in frustration. I cannot remember ever quitting this game from annoyance up until now. 

In my opinion, they need to REMOVE the limited deletes. If you‚Äôre going to have limited deletes, then let them be used on my own mistakes, not the game‚Äôs RNG.

P.S. - the viability of a perfect hunt on professional or nightmare while running solo feels next to removed from the game, now.

Diagnosed w/small HH two years ago and symptoms come and go. Sometimes I feel perfectly normal for days or even weeks, then like total crap for days or weeks. My stomach just doesn't know what to do with food anymore. I have constant gas (flatulence), bloating, low-grade burning sensation in stomach. Sometimes my stomach will decide to hold onto food for day or two, then I get diarrhea. 

Can almost never really tell if I'm hungry or not - I just eat on a schedule and hope for the best, though I've cut down on food consumption by about 20% overall. I try to eat well before bedtime to avoid feeling awful while trying to sleep. Small meals help. I get bold when I'm on a 'good streak' and sometime drink a very small spot of coffee after cereal (like 3-4 sips). That can sometimes trigger an 'episode,' though, so it's a gamble. 

No GERD. No heartburn. Just a churning, gassy, spoiled stomach. 

Over time, this can really wear you down and make you depressed. That's where I am now after a 2-month streak of bad stomach. It's a genuine MF\*ker. 

Going to see a surgeon in a couple of weeks for a consult. Saw one a year ago and he barely listened to me, then he blasted out a list of things he was going to do .... blah blah blah, very fast, no explanations. Then he said it's my choice, do it or not, gimme a call if you decide to. What a dick he was. That put me off the whole thing until a year later I called for another referral. (My GI was appalled at the first surgeon's behavior, but said she had heard things like that about him before). 

Hoping to have surgery in late July but skip the fundoplication. 

So anyway. Anybody have this particular set of symptoms? I switch between Omeprazole and Famotidine, but also have a small stock of Rabeprazole as my 'nuclear option' as needed (it's not covered by my insurance and quite expensive). Also Gas-X and Pepto. The works. 

I'm vegan, not overweight, 56yo male in good shape. I do lots of yoga, which seems to help with the symptoms.

1ljdt6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WeaknessEqual2656/comments/1ljdt6v/if_youre_reading_this_im_probably_dead_and_my/,"If You're Reading This, I'm Probably Dead, And My Wife is the Killer","Before I get too far ahead of myself, I'm writing this in a Google Doc and I've shared it with a close friend that my wife doesn't know, for security reasons. I've asked him to upload it to the internet in the event that something happens to me. Therefore, if you're reading this, then I'm probably dead. And my wife is the killer.

I didn't want to believe it at first, but there's been several strange occurrences over the past few weeks that have led me to this conclusion. My wife and I have been married for almost 5 years now, and have had a fairly happy and healthy relationship the entire time. We did have some trouble a couple of years back when I discovered my wife had been secretly chatting with a coworker of hers, who had recently transitioned from a close friend to a lover, but we were able to put it past us after several marital counseling sessions. However, I'd be lying if I said I didn't still think about it from time to time. I can‚Äôt possibly describe what a tremendous blow that was to my self-esteem and especially to my mental health.

Ever since then, we have been living a fairly typical day-to-day life. But then 3 weeks ago, we were driving towards a shopping mall when one of my tires began shaking uncontrollably. I barely managed to pull the car over without hitting anyone and the entire ordeal left us pretty shaken. When I got out of the car to check the tires, I realized the shaking was the result of the¬† rear driver‚Äôs side wheel nearly falling off, as 4 of the 5 lug nuts were about halfway loosened. I perform all of the routine maintenance on our vehicles and I can say with absolute certainty that this was not something I overlooked.

I didn't really think too much about it at first and just chalked it up to a freak accident, especially since my wife was also scared stiff when it happened. However, things just got progressively worse soon after. About a week later, I was eating my lunch at work when I suddenly bit down on something hard. When I fished it out of my mouth, I was surprised to see a small piece of glass, about the size of a fingernail. I was too shocked to even realize that I had gashed the inside of my mouth and almost instantly afterwards ran to the sink in the breakroom and began spitting blood like I had just been poisoned. After thoroughly rinsing out my mouth and regaining my composure, I looked at the glass Pyrex tupperware my lunch was packed in. I saw there was a small chip on the rounded lip of the container that was hard to notice unless you really focused on it for a few seconds.

I immediately called my wife and began explaining what had happened. I didn't throw any serious accusations at her, other than the fact that she was the one who packed the lunch and maybe had accidentally bumped the tupperware while she was packing it. She claimed it must have cracked in the microwave and swore to me that she didn't notice anything wrong with it when she packed it earlier that morning. I had my suspicions but I did notice she began crying when I finished explaining what had happened. She did seem fairly apologetic about the whole thing, especially once she learned that I had injured myself.

Was she just putting on an act to cover her tracks? Her sobs seemed painfully real and she kept apologizing over and over, insisting that it was ‚Äújust an accident"". I started to think that maybe my insecurities were getting the best of me and I was conjuring up some sort of wild conspiracy theory that my wife was out to get me for some reason. But the final ‚Äúaccident‚Äù is the one that finally broke me. After this, I was convinced she wasn‚Äôt just out to hurt me; she wanted me dead. It had been two weeks since the tupperware incident, and nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, but I was still on high alert. And it seems my anxiety wasn't just me being paranoid after all.¬†

Last Tuesday morning, I was sitting in my office sipping my coffee and was about 2/3rds done with my thermos when I started feeling incredibly nauseous. I thought maybe the creamer had gone bad and immediately stopped drinking it, switching to water and hoping that my stomach would start feeling better. Sadly, the nausea quickly turned into a horrific stomach ache and eventually had me on my knees heaving aggressively into the toilet bowl. I had experienced violent bouts of vomiting before, but this was different. I felt a horrific burning sensation in my stomach, like I had swallowed something akin to sulfuric acid. My supervisor noticed me in the bathroom and became so concerned that she ended up calling the paramedics. Once they arrived, they injected me with an IV to replenish my fluids and began asking me if I had eaten or drank anything that might have triggered a serious reaction. Once I explained I had only drank coffee and water that morning, they thought that maybe I had a serious case of dehydration, exacerbated by the coffee and made even worse by spoiled creamer. But when I described the burning sensation in my throat and stomach, their demeanor changed. Thankfully, the leftover coffee was still sitting in my thermos on my desk.

I ended up spending the rest of the day in the emergency room, receiving several tests just to rule out I wasn't suffering from some undiagnosed ailment. I explained to the doctor the events that had transpired that morning and I also had the paramedics bring the thermos with them to try to prove I wasn't just sick with food poisoning. They managed to take a sample of the coffee and run it through a few tests to try to find traces of some common bacteria that may have caused my symptoms. They couldn't find traces of anything typical of a food-borne illness, E-Coli, listeria, shigella, etc. But what they did find was even more terrifying, once I realized what it actually was.

The first question they asked after getting the results of the coffee analysis was ""do you suffer from seasonal allergies? Do you or have you ever suffered from eye irritation?"" ""No...?"" I answered hoarsely. Then the next question. ""Do you ever use eye drops? Do you ever use Visine or maybe a similar product?"" Their questions seemed perfectly innocuous, but the second I put a little bit of thought into what they had asked, I felt the blood drain from my face completely. ""...no..."" I was barely able to mumble the words, the dry sensation of my throat felt like sandpaper and metal shavings rubbing together. ""...but my wife does..."" What they eventually found was that the coffee had a significant concentration of something called ‚Äútetrahydrozoline‚Äù, which is the active ingredient in most commonly found OTC eye drops. My wife relied on them pretty heavily, as her seasonal allergies would flare up pretty regularly and she also suffered from dry-eye constantly. They explained that although this chemical is meant to relieve eye irritation, ingestion in large quantities can often produce effects similar to what I experienced, along with shortness of breath, cardiac arrhythmia, and also¬†*death*. They explained that it could have likely been the combination of this chemical with the coffee/creamer that caused me to throw up so violently and that if not for that, I might not still be alive.

I explained to the hospital staff that our medicine cabinet is in the kitchen, directly above where our coffeemaker sits. Although I felt like I was betraying every cell and fiber in my body, I felt obligated to exclaim ""my wife probably left them on the edge of the medicine counter and forgot to put the cap back on. It was probably just an accident..."" They sent me home later that day, conveniently around the same time when I would usually get home from work. I said absolutely nothing of what had happened that morning to my wife. When she curiously asked ""Hey, where's your coffee thermos??"" I had to fight back the urge to scream at her as loud as I possibly could. Even if I had wanted to, I was still pretty fatigued from the hospital visit and simply replied ""I left it on my desk. Sorry."" ""Ah no worries, just please bring it back tomorrow!"" She said with a smile, and kissed my cheek. My resolve at this point was absolute. I needed to prove I wasn't crazy. I needed to prove she was out to get me, and I needed to capture it in the moment. This was the only way I would be able to prove that these strange occurrences weren't just accidents.

But there was still a single lingering question that I couldn't answer no matter how hard I tried. What was her motive? Why was she doing this? It's not like I had a massive life insurance policy that she could benefit from in the event of my demise. Was she having an affair again? Despite her shortcomings, she definitely had this perfectly planned out. All of her attempts were all just coincidental enough to be considered accidents, which was the perfect cover, plausible deniability being what it is. This led me to believe she had been living a double life again, and I was determined once and for all to prove what she had done.¬†

I went online and purchased a small infrared security camera that could run off of a battery and record to a micro-SD card. When it arrived, I positioned it behind the AC grate in our kitchen in such a way that it could capture the refrigerator and the kitchen sink. I couldn't get a shot of either of the two hallways that led to the kitchen from this angle, but I was sure it was enough to capture any future instances of foul play. I figured her last two attempts had involved my food and drinks and she nearly succeeded with the last one, so this was likely going to be her last attempt for a while. I set the camera to record at all times and left it in place for the next 3 days. On the morning of the fourth day, I took the micro-SD card out of the camera and took it to work with me. When I arrived at my desk, I immediately plugged the micro-SD card into my laptop and reviewed the footage from the past three days. But as it turns out, nothing I had experienced the past few weeks would prepare for what I had just seen.

At about 3:49 AM, I saw her enter the frame. It was pitch black in the kitchen and the IR filter on the camera was not the greatest, considering the small size of the camera. But it was just enough to see her entering the kitchen and going into the refrigerator. She took the Brita filter out, put it up to her lips and drank profusely. I couldn't see it but I could hear her going into the pantry, in the hallway around the corner. She went into the sink and washed her hands and arms with the water just barely trickling out of the spout. Her behavior was more confusing than it was suspicious, and after a few minutes, she exited the frame and did not return for the rest of the recording until I woke up later that morning.

You might be thinking that despite it being a little weird, this is perfectly harmless behavior, right? I would've thought the same thing, if not for one minor detail. My wife's hair color is brown and is also fairly long, almost down to her waist. The recording, despite the awful camera quality, did show one thing very clearly. The woman in the footage had short blonde hair.

I've allredy done a bit of research into it and fixed a problem with the wiring on the inside, wich was probably the reason it was thrown away. There is something a bit weird about it, the portafilter and the group head are (in my opinion) very weird compared to the pictures i found of the machine online.

1ljdrnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1ljdrnr/trying_to_make_sense_of_my_interview_process_so/,Trying to make sense of my interview process so far,"I am interviewing for a newly created Director-level position for a very large organization. The interview process so far has felt very different from any I've participated in before and I'm trying to make sense of it. 

I applied for this role at the very end of May and then also had a prior colleague who now works for this company submit my application through their internal system. A few days later I was contacted by the recruiter for an interview.

In my interview with the recruiter (6/9), she gathered all the standard information a recruiter would and then told me a bit about the position and the rest of the interview process. She said that they were trying to get through initial interviews within the next two weeks (by 6/20) so they could try to bring in final candidates for an ""onsite visit"" during an event they were holding. The majority of the leaders are remote so they thought they'd capitalize on everyone being in one place at one time. She mentioned that would be ""around the end of the month"". 

From there, things progressed very quickly. I met with the SVP (skip-level leader). He said that typically he wouldn't be this early in the process but he wanted to meet me. He shared a lot about his background, the position, asked about my background, and then the rest of the questions were not standard interview questions--felt very conversational. Interview lasted about 40 minutes.

Three days later I met with the hiring manager for only 20 minutes. She spent about 6 of those minutes telling me more about the role. She asked two or three questions but they felt very much like we were chatting over coffee. ""Here's my biggest challenge right now. How does that resonate?"" At the end she told me that I was meeting with her because I was on their short list, she loved what I had to say and could talk to me about it all day if she had more time, and that she would be circling back with the recruiter so they could let me know about next steps in the process. 

In total, I've had one hour of interviews (outside the recruiter) where 30 mins was learning about the role/the interviewers, 10 minutes were spent allowing me to ask questions, and only 20 minutes was spent asking me questions (none of which felt like actual interview questions). 

It's now been a week since that interview and I'm waiting for a response from the recruiter. I'm not too concerned, there's a lot that could be happening right now (finishing up interviews, Juneteenth holiday/PTO, figuring out how they're bringing people onsite should that be the next step, making decisions, etc). I have no reason to believe I'm out of the running but I'm just perplexed by this entire process. I'm trying not to get my hopes up but it's hard not to see how this has progressed and feel like I've got a good shot ... while also feeling like if they were bringing people onsite ""at the end of the month"" I probably should have heard something by now.

Anyway, sharing this more just to get it out of my head because interviewing sucks, but if anyone feels they have advice or interpretation that would help then feel free to chime in.",1,1750778090.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

CW: 214 lb
GW: 185 lb
Height: 6‚Äô-2‚Äù

I started in February and have lost 40 pounds. My goal weight is 185 pounds and I‚Äôm currently on track to hit that late September.

Some of the things I‚Äôve been doing in addition to the GLP1 is walking, hiking, and biking. My goal is 7k-10k steps per day and 12 miles of cycling per week. 

I‚Äôve also been drinking different types of fiber to help my diet and stay regular. I‚Äôve rarely experienced constipation while on GLP1 I think because of all the fiber. My only side effect I‚Äôve had is sometimes I‚Äôll have nausea in the mornings for a few minutes, but that usually goes away once I‚Äôve had my fiber drink or a coffee. With all the fiber I try and stay VERY well hydrated.

My diet is also just a coffee and fiber drink for breakfast, a small lunch like two street tacos or a ham sandwich, and a small dinner. I‚Äôve noticed that my hunger cravings are stronger in the last couple of weeks than they‚Äôve been at any time using the medication, however the medication has helped me understand how much food to eat and create healthy habits. So even though I‚Äôm really hungry, I can still manage it. 

So for any doubters that say this isn‚Äôt permanent, it totally can be. Being on the medication for a few months has helped program good habits and a better understanding of how much to eat into my brain.

1ljdl1a,https://i.redd.it/1f15b0yv4w8f1.jpeg,Carribean Beach Mickey is my Spirit Animal. A trip report,"Just got back from our Biannual Trip to Disney and must say I had a blast. Rain mostly stayed away and we accomplished everything we wanted. Party of 5-- 3 adults, 6yo, 2yo. We do not rope drop.


Sat 6/14: Arrived from our super early flight. Waited like 5 minutes for our Mears Bus. When I got to the desk at CBR, our room wasnt ready (it was super early, after all) but we did get the building we requested.  Im not usually a pancake guy, but let me tell you those pineapple pancakes were great.  After a short skyliner and boat trip we got to Fantasia Gardens for some free Mini Golf.  The course is definately in need of some TLC as some of the effects werent working, but im pretty sure the only people who go there are the people cashing in their free tickets, so why is Disney gonna spend more than they have to.  Took a walk down the Boardwalk in search of food and ended up getting some pretty good food at the Yacht Club's market quick service.


Sun: Skylined into Hollywood Studios about 9:30 and finally got to ride Rise with only a 35 minute wait. I got lucky with parent swap and got to ride both sides. Toy Story Mania was 45min wait and Slinky Dog was about the same.  Ate lunch at ABC which was decent. Better cause it wasnt super busy and we found a table on our first lap around the dining area.  Wated 2 cycles of Swirling Saucers before we got on and then got on Runaway Railway in less than 25 minutes.  Took the kids over to the DJr Dance Party where they had a whole bunch of extra stuff for Cool Kid Summer. Pluto, Donald, Chip n Dale, Goofy and Clarabell were all just doing walk arounds.  Hit up Scoops before walking on to ToT and a 25 minute wait to say our goodbye to the Aerosmith preshow that is somehow more painfull than Rock n Rollercoaster.  Although it rained a short bit, the lightning stayed away and Fantasmic went on. It clearly was my 2yo favorite nighttime show.


Mon: rolled into Magic Kingdom around 10. Got some coffee at Revive and then hit Dumbo, Daisy and Minnie and walked on Barnstormer twice for my 6yo.  A bit of a longer line for Little Mermaid, but I only had to wait 45 minutes for my parent swap on 7DMT.  I was bummed that my go to Cheshire Cafe spot was cordoned off, but there was plenty of shade in front of the Tea Party to wait it out.  Rode said Teacups and Carousel before food. Lunch was Chicken Caesar salads at Village Haus. Typical theme park food.  Then we took one last ride on The Liberty Belle to remind us why we never ride it. Mansion and Pirates were both walkons and because my 6yo didnt believe me how terrible the Treehouse is, we got our flights in for the day. We staked out a good spot for HAE, ate some Spring Rolls, and then walked on to Peter Pan.


Tue: Skylinered to Epcot and got finally got to do Remi. It was 45 minutes and the longest wait of the day.  Walked on Imagination, i watched the 2yo for half an hour while everyone else rode Soarin. Our walk on of Living With the Land was hampered only by a 10 minute cleanup of one of the boats.  We had lunch at an empty Coral Reef. It gets a bad rap, but ive always enjoyed my food there and the kids and their Mimi loved spotting the fish.  Let the kids get a little we through Journey of Water which has one of the best photopass ops in the park, mind you.  Got stuck on Spaceship Earth for 20 minutes and then set the kids up at Mission Space so the 2yo could nap and the 6yo could run around while my Wife and I cashed in our LL for Cosmic Rewind.  We got Tears for Fears.  Then it was off to World Showcase for Schoolbread, Frozen, and Gran Marnier Slushies before Luminous.  Ate dinner at Centertown where the Swashbuckler burger and Cuban Fries exceeded our expectations.


Wed: 10:45 Breakfast at Chef Mickeys with waaay too much food. A Monoral Ride, and then Swimming at the del Morro pool. Dinner was at Enzo's. The drinks and food were great.  We actually made it to the old shopping village section of Springs (somehow we never make it past World of Disney) and walked right in to the Lego Store. 6yo loved making his minifig.


Thu: Back to MK to do the stuff we didnt do tuesday. It was Juneteenth and noticably busier.  Took a grand circle tour on the Train, which we havent done since 2013ish. Waited an hour for Space Mountain. 45 for Buzz. Im glad Buzz is going down--those guns are beyond old and busted. 15 minutes for People Mover.  Got a good spot for the parade but the rain said nope. So we rode out the heaviest in the Emporium before catching the rain delay Monorails to Ohana.  Say what you want about the noodles and the potstickers, the Chicken is where it was at. And the desert, of course.  Went back to the park and finally got onto Tianas. I could care less what the theming is. The flume is the fun. Jt was my 6yos first time and he loved it Jungle Cruise and Winnie the Pooh. Got off our honeypot just as HAE was starting so we took the kids on the Speedway to at least have the fireworks to make the ride worth it.  Took some night castle photos and hit the bus.


Fri: cashed in LL to finally ride Flight of Passage. Everyone loved it but the 6yo. The preshow killed his buzz for it. Waited too long for Navi River, but it was the kids and grandmas first time, and they enjoyed it.  We ate lunch at Harambe Market which was fast and good. The rain that was threatening all morning finally started, but it was more of a drizzle than a typical florida mid day downpour. There must have been some lightning though cause the outdoor rides were shut down. We did get to pretty much walk on the Safari, only the animals in the way of the trucks kept it from being a true walk on.  The rain must have made the animals happy because they were all out and about. Even the rhinos.  Took the 6yo for one last play through The Boneyard and just then Everest opened back up so we could ride before we left for the day. Just had Centertown pizza and fish tacos for dinner. My mom took the 6yo to swim and my wife and i skylined over to the boardwalk for ice cream.  Only downside to this plan was that we had to get in the post fireworks line at the end of the Beach Club to get back to the Riviera station.


Sat: checkout and pool day. Mears came right when they advertised and got back to mco without a hitch.


Overall: glad I finally got to ride FoP and RotR. Two days at mk definitely helped us do everything  we wanted to. Did not ride Tron or Dinosaur.  Tron disappointed me two years ago, and Im just not that big of a fan of Dinosaur.  Food was as expected or better everywhere we ate. Centertown Market was better than it was our last stay. I was worried Ohana was overhyped but i enjoyed it. That chicken was delicious.  As Kenny Rogers one said, ""its the wood that makes it good"".  I have yet to cross Trader Sams and Ogas off my to do list, but im gonna save that for an adult trip.  Fantasmic is still my favorite show. My 2yo agrees. My wife is still partial to HAE. Even though a grown woman directly behind us sort of ruined part of it by screaming at the top of her lungs when Tinkerbelle appeared. I get it, its Disney, its Magic, but at the end of the day is a dude on a zipline who is not going to hear you no matter how loud you are.  We did not experience any blatant line jumping. Of couse the lines were pretty short every day but Juneteenth.

We will be back in 27.

no real programming experience but need to look into switching careers soon due to chronic pain getting worse, was hoping that pico 8 would be simple and low stakes enough to teach me something basic over my two weeks of vacation, and tbf it has gone way smoother than learning godot or javascript so far.

that being said, i have hit a wall(a function can't add/delete enemies from table+sfx() function seems to ignore states). so far, i've been able to sleep on it, watch a quick tutorial maybe, and come up with something that works. but i've been trying  to figure out something for the last 3 or so hours and nothing works. and then, when i try to watch a tutorial on my problem, they are always either implementing enemies in a way that would not work for me in the slightest, or its an half an hour video focusing on stuff that i've already learned.

maybe my adhd is just too severe for this programming stuff. every time i google a solution, i get reccomended the same tutorials that i already tried to get through and gave up on. nerdy teachers move at a glacial pace, lazy dev is too rambling for me to follow, so far spacecat has been the one that manages to keep my attention by making their point simply and quickly, but it all feels pretty surface level. i just know to fully understand what i'm doing wrong i need to watch like, 6 hours of someone slowly explaining how functions and variables work, and so when they mention how to do what i'm doing, i won't be paying attention.

i know im just burned out, and need to take a break, but i know as soon as i take a break, all the info i learned will disappear, and i will have to start from scratch.

well. i'm out of energy, i just spilled coffee all over myself, i'm in a horrible mood, i'm meeting my friend in 2 hours and will presumably be in a horrible mood then, and i'm going back to work on friday. i feel like a failure.

thanks for reading through if you did, will probably delete this soon

When she had been trying to think of something to do with her life and come up with nothing the last thing she considered was becoming a sniper in the Special Forces, and yet here she was; promotion after promotion the moment she arrived, and her therapist informed her that it was all down to her own hard work. Now, there had been some trouble with a Hispanic Woman who had become a bully towards her by doubting her competency ‚Äúyou make us all look bad‚Äù she loved to say in order to make Jane question herself, but overall every Man had given her nothing but encouragement, from watching the bathroom door while she went to the toilet, to helping her through the exams, to telling her ‚Äúshe deserved it more‚Äù when she was promoted over them, to taking bullets for her, everyone was so nice.

By the time she had shot dead the McDonalds service boy she hadn‚Äôt stopped to consider that all Men weren‚Äôt out to get her, but in a strange way that‚Äôs how she felt. Behind every smile was a sneer, behind every injured colleagues insistence of ‚Äújust doing his job‚Äù was a grimace of contempt.

Jane screamed again as she emptied her magazine wildly in all directions.

She wouldn‚Äôt lie to herself that it had been a mistake, as the General would later order her to say under oath, that she had mistaken him for a Muslim, no, she knew it was him coming with her coca cola as he had said he would after helping her clean some of the excrement from her boots, and all she felt was humiliation.

What she couldn‚Äôt explain was why she had sexually assaulted the corpse afterwards.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, we‚Äôll cover it up,‚Äù the General would say, as they always did, but none of it felt right.

‚ÄúWhat am I even doing here?‚Äù she shouted, ‚ÄúI never should have been given a weapon or put in charge of something this, I barely know what I‚Äôm doing,‚Äù now she was in floods of tears, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a girl!‚Äù and she collapsed onto the Generals coffee table.

The room had fallen silent. Jane, by now, was past even pretending she could understand how Men‚Äôs minds worked, but soon enough a hand was on her shoulder from one direction and a box of tissues came in front of her from another, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù someone said, and then, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the world that‚Äôs messed up, I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs true,‚Äù and then, ‚Äúquickly someone‚Äôs coming,‚Äù and then there was talking at the door of the office.

Jane turned her head and saw the hideous face of one of the tranny officers, his gaunt haggard cheeks dusted with powder and his vile expression extenuated with lipstick.

‚ÄúOh please no,‚Äù Jane reached out for the retreating officers who turned away and even openly backed away as the tranny flounced towards Jane to give her ‚Äòthe embrace‚Äô and Jane disassociated herself, the rest of the afternoon was a blur.

/

Several days had passed when Jane started receiving WhatsApp messages ‚Äòcongratulating her‚Äô on taking out the Ayatollah and a photograph of a Kill Team unit was forwarded to her with the caption ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of you‚Äù and Jane realized that her name had been put next to the blurred out face of Corporal Eichner whose whole body seemed to have been edited with one of those Facebook Apps to blow out the hips and tiny-up the ankles, and so on, a really professional job.

‚ÄúThanks‚Äù Jane wrote back to a school chum, ‚Äúit was nothing really.‚Äù

And then she smiled contentedly and thought about the future.

\\

It was with some shock that she found herself, some years later, coming across the shivering remains of Corporal Eichner on a street corner. It was unmistakably him, and anyway if the reader doubts it I may remind the reader that this is a fictional story and that the writer absolutely ensures that it was him. Jane stared at his old service coat and his crass unshaven, altogether unkempt, personage looking no better than a dog.

‚ÄúWhat a loser!‚Äù Jane thought, chuckling under her breath as she walked by, as it seemed to her then no wonder at all that she was promoted over the likes of someone who‚Äôd leave the house without wearing clean clothes.

But as she scoffed a little too loudly she disturbed Corporal Eichner who then glared up at her and his face began to form a scowl, ‚Äúyou!‚Äù he shouted, and he grabbed hold of Jane and dragged her into his hobo camp.

Her many years of instructing young Service Women and Men in Martial Arts did nothing to ward off the brute who was not even particularly fit and coughed in an unseemly manner all throughout the engagement and then had to have a sit down to gather his breath, whilst Janes body-fat and therefore overall physical fitness had never been better.

‚ÄúWhy are you doing this, you fucking loser?‚Äù Jane shouted, ‚Äúit‚Äôs because you‚Äôre jealous of my success, aren‚Äôt you? Well I earned it!‚Äù

Corporal Eichner said nothing at this.

‚ÄúAnd I bet you aren‚Äôt even married,‚Äù Jane went on, ‚Äúwho‚Äôd have you, you fucking loser?‚Äù

At this Corporal Eichner turned his head and began to laugh.

‚ÄúI told them,‚Äù he muttered, ‚ÄúI told them it would be this way when they started having us do the heavy lifting to carry the niggers, then the faggots and then the Italians and then the crippled and the blind and then the girls and then the trannies, to do all their work and let them take the credit while covering up for their fuck ups all the time,‚Äù he was clearly on some form of narcotic judging by his wreckless use of Hate Speeches, ‚Äúand they all said it would be worth it, that we‚Äôd retire rich eventually, but you know what I got for doing your job and ending a war and letting someone like you take all the credit?‚Äù

His face was maddened now.

‚ÄúI got fired by a tranny!‚Äù he shouted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a National Hero! A fucking War Hero!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just your own delusions,‚Äù replied Jane, ‚ÄúI know my own self-worth and I‚Äôm proud of my accomplishments, they aren‚Äôt delusions because you can read about them in the newspaper, you‚Äôre just trying to make me doubt my own self-worth,‚Äù and she added, ‚Äúyou fucking loser.‚Äù

And so Corporal Eichner began to beat Jane across the head and in the face. He wasn‚Äôt sure what Jane had been trying to do and it was only until the majority of her face had transferred to pulpy fragments of wet bone and jelly covering his knuckles that he realized that girl all along might have been a mental retard, and this only made him angrier.

But he knew who was to blame and now he had tasted satisfaction there was no holding him back from pursuing the ultimate party, Keith Patterson, the school teacher who had encouraged him to join the Army.

\\

‚ÄúGoodness me!‚Äù exclaimed Keith, perturbed by the sight of a dishevelled-looking homeless man waving his arms around and pacing up and down in front of the old school library, which had been converted into a Womens Fitness Club and Juice Bar where Keith sometimes went, partly for nostalgia in both instances, ‚ÄúI think someone had better telephone the Police,‚Äù and Keith had spent his early childhood years in Norfolk England and so pronounce it ‚Äòplees‚Äô.

Several of the Martial Arts Instructors shouted at him from behind the counter to do something and they questioned his masculinity. This caused Keith to scoff very loudly for a moment, but he bit his tongue, for he was an Educated Man and knew better than to run the risk of a sex crime accusation by pointing out the amusing contradiction in their vocation and request and of the current year, and so on.

‚ÄúOh alright then,‚Äù he relented.

Before Corporal Eichner knew what was happening he was being roughly shaken by the hand and money forced into his palm, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a good chap,‚Äù or something like that anyway was said and this was perhaps the greatest mistake Keith had ever made, for: Corporal Eichner recognized him at once from his accent and was driving an inexpensive kitchen knife in and out of Keith‚Äôs ribs whilst shouting and spitting in his face.

The Martial Arts Instructors, watching this from afar behind plexiglass sheeting, began to scream at the sight of the little old Man being full-on fucking wrecked by the homeless bum, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs got a gun,‚Äù one of them squealed into the telephone, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs black,‚Äù another shouted, ‚Äúsend help immediately,‚Äù and things of this nature.

/

Now, as it so happened I was sitting in my White Van several streets away listening to this on my police scanner and ‚Äòjust happened‚Äô to be wearing my fake policemans uniform and carrying my gun. I was always at the look-about for situations just like this one, and immediately I had pulled up in front of the Fitness Club and waved the Women into the back of my Van, lying to them and making-pretend it was a rescue, and then we drove to my House where I beat them unconscious quite haphazardly and put them in chains in my cellar for what would most likely be months of sexual torture until, as with the last batch, I accidentally killed them through negligence and would sell the remainder live- or near to it anyway, for organs.

I had a good chuckle over my Rice Krispies the following morning when young Ted brought me the morning paper with the headline ‚Äúwhite supremacist neo-nazi misogynist slays decorated war hero and educator, abducts three,‚Äù and ‚Äúdwarf soldiers impersonate children in Gaza‚Äù and I knocked a tear from my eye from laughter, particularly so at the former; whilst the latter caused me considerable anguish, such was the absurdity of things nowadays, and I invited Ted in for coffee.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mr Waheed,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut last time we had that ‚Äòmisunderstanding‚Äô and I‚Äôm not homophobic or islamophobic or anything but-‚Äù I cut him off, ‚Äúbless my soul,‚Äù I exclaimed, ‚Äúthat was in the past,‚Äù and I laughed and reiterated my invitation and he walked into my house for a second time as if expecting any different outcome than what had befallen him on the first occasion.

I adjusted my turban and lifted my shalwar-kameeze before positioning myself at his backside, hands upon my hips, and trusting vigorously while calling out, in my heathen tongue, ‚Äúgod is great,‚Äù until he ran screaming and I, by now in hysterics, removed my turban and put my Jewish Hat back on, and then because now God could see me I thought to say very loudly, ‚ÄúI believe in God,‚Äù and that was me done for the day.

I‚Äôm a long time lurker, using a throwaway because my other accounts have my face attached in some capacity. I've previously used this account on this sub before hence the name. Also obviously not real names and ages have been altered so that my chronically online household does not find this. I‚Äôll try to be brief on background but there‚Äôs a lot and I‚Äôm happy to answer any question in detail in the comments because I am admittedly glazing over so much more than I can write here.

I (F33) have been with my partner, Chloe (F29), for almost 2 years. We met on a dating website and since the first date, she has been truly one of the most supportive, amazing partners I‚Äôve ever had.  

Right when we first met, she made it clear that she was living with her sister, Emily (F23) who showed up at her door after getting kicked out of her mom‚Äôs home nearly 4 years ago and that she had promised to take care of her due to her poor mental health. At the time, I thought this was admirable, sweet, and extremely empathetic, qualities I love about my girlfriend as a whole. 

Around the time we became serious, I confided in Chloe that I had been struggling for years in the city we lived in and even more so since losing my job in a very niche industry, just barely making rent every month and that by the end of my lease, I would be leaving the state to start fresh. Instead, she convinced me to have her and her sister move in since their lease was also ending and my place was cheaper. We had very serious discussions on what the move would look like and all the possible dynamics that may arise in a shared living environment with their sister. Unfortunately, their move into mine was not the smoothest and it was clear that Emily was very resentful of not only the rushed move by Chloe, but by the nature of our relationship and how we met and clicked very suddenly. 

It‚Äôs been two years since they moved in and truly it started off great but little by little it was clear that Emily was unhappy with the situation and frankly I am too. 

Some background on Emily: Emily is one of these self-purported ‚ÄúBPD girlies‚Äù. They are extremely online and chronically so. They are constantly doom scrolling, arguing with strangers on social media and when they‚Äôre not doing that, they are gaming online in the most toxic game lobbies. She does not work, does not want to work and before Chloe and I met, Emily put Chloe into thousands of dollars of credit card debit that she has never offered to try and pay back. She had a job but was fired from it due to calling in and no-showing. It seems, whether or not she is serious or joking, that her dream is to be a SAHM and sugar baby.  

It started when I noticed at their old apartment that dishes would just be rotting everywhere - in their sinks, on their desks, everywhere. I asked that when they moved that everyone has a chore to work on (Beyond taking care of your own laundry and cleaning your individual room) - I took care of general pick up and vacuuming of the living room, Chloe agreed to take out the garbage, recycling, and cleaning the cat boxes, and Emily had said she could do the dishes. Awesome! Except not. A month into this arrangement, Emily complains to Chloe that it was ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to have to wash everyone‚Äôs dishes and that we should all be responsible for our own dishes. Fine. From that point, I washed and dried every dish I would use. Emily? Once a month, she would have a maniac cleaning episode by ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù their room aka moving all the trash to the kitchen next to the bin instead of taking it outside and putting the old rotting dishes in the sink to ‚Äúsoak‚Äù only for them to be left for hours in lukewarm disgusting water because they started gaming and by the time they would remember, they would just throw in the dishwasher (which ours sucked and didn‚Äôt actually clean the dishes). It‚Äôs gotten worse since we now do not have a dishwasher.They leave food messes everywhere - soup cans, ramen wrappers, loose cereal and rice all over the counter, etc.  Both me and Chloe have tried to make an effort to tell them to finish the job  they started and pick up after themselves but nothing has changed. 

This behaviour is part of a bigger problem I‚Äôve observed which is that Emily doesn‚Äôt want to have to work for anything, refuses to respect boundaries, and cannot take no for an answer. If they can‚Äôt get something from my girlfriend, she‚Äôll just move on to me or her mom or her stepdad. They‚Äôre extremely critical to the people closest to them and constantly projecting their insecurities onto others. They also routinely do not take care of themselves - they won‚Äôt shower until her scalp hurts, won‚Äôt brush their teeth until they hurt, and wears the same clothes day in and day out. 

Okay so now that‚Äôs the background, onto WHY I‚Äôm here and needing advice desperately because me and my girlfriend are at a loss:

We moved and our new place does not have A/C as it is an old historical building and we are currently in a terrible heat wave. We‚Äôve been attempting to keep it cool but the place is big and only so much air can move around as we only have one portable AC unit. 

According to my girlfriend, her and Emily had spoken the night prior (so Friday night) on FaceTime about moving the AC unit to another part of the home to try and facilitate some air movement into the bedrooms as that‚Äôs where most of the heat was still lingering (keep in mind, I was NOT made aware of this conversion at all). When I woke up, my girlfriend was futzing with the AC (mostly weatherproofing it which I apparently didn‚Äôt do the best but hey, the instructions aren‚Äôt gonna tell you to wrap your hose in plastic to retain the cool air). Afterwards, she noticed one of the fans wasn‚Äôt working properly. Towards the end of her fixing this, Emily comes out after waking up and demands that she and Chloe move the AC unit. Chloe tells her she will be ready to do that once she finishes fixing the fan and that she‚Äôs just finishing. This prompts Chloe to grab her purse, angrily put on their shoes, and walk out the door with no word to us about where they are going. 

My girlfriend finishes the fan and we discuss moving the AC while we wait for Emily to come back since they were supposed to do it together. An hour and a half goes by and no Emily. I have tried messaging her asking where she was. Chloe decides she is going to try and nap because she‚Äôs been up all night. 20 minutes after Chloe lays down, Emily barges into the apartment, yet again angrily demanding that the AC be moved NOW. I tell them their sister just laid down so unless she can convince her to get up, she‚Äôll have to wait for after her nap. She then demands that I start moving things. For some context - I have MDD and currently recovering from a twisted pelvis after pushing ourselves from the move to our new place. I told them I already discussed moving things with Chloe and that again, it will be done after her nap. This makes Emily LOSE IT. She begins screaming at me that no one listens to them, that I‚Äôm a terrible roommate, that I ‚Äúonly work 20 hours a week‚Äù (Better than your 0 but okay?), and begins to scream they want AC in their room, amongst other terrible shit. I tell them to leave the room and stop screaming at me, they tell me I‚Äôm not their fucking mom before going into their room to slam more items and scream about how much they hate me. During this I am crying and shaking and I call my mom to come get me. After the call ends, Emily comes out for round two to scream at me more, to which Chloe finally gets awoken by them screaming at me, only from them to get screamed at as well and then make a run towards the AC unit installed in the window, I assume to rip it out of the wall. I grabbed them and pulled them away from it where they proceeded to kick my makeup and attempt to throw a spare tire at myself and my girlfriend, screaming about how no one listens to them and how much they fucking hate us. At this point, all I can remember is being on the floor screaming for them to get out over and over and over again which they do finally, slamming the door on the way out. 

It took my mom about 15 minutes to get to me, in that time my girlfriend was fully dissociated, I‚Äôm angrily cleaning up all the makeup thrown about. We discuss what to do and I tell Chloe I am going to leave until Emily comes back and they discuss things but that me being there for it will only make things worse so I will be at my moms until she tells me it's okay to come back

I was able to return home after about three and half hours. According to my girlfriend, they came back after two hours only to yell at them more about ‚Äúbroken promises‚Äù Chloe made (that in hindsight were wholly unrealistic to even promise in the first place, even if Chloe was trying to helpful but ultimately these are promises no one, not even a partner, could ever fulfill), that she was supposed to love her ‚Äúunconditionally‚Äù (aka Chloe being the only one who changes and grows and Emily gets to be supported in all of their toxic habits). I don‚Äôt know all the details as these are the ones that have come up in our talks. Her sister packed up their cat and belongings and is now back staying with their parents for at least a week. 

So now we‚Äôre here. We have the house to ourselves and honestly? It‚Äôs blissful. No one screaming at video games until 3AM, no doom and gloom right as we wake up, my girlfriend has so much energy to actually do housework without her sister there ‚Äúbody doubling‚Äù aka standing around and commenting on every little thing they do. 

My question is that her being away is temporary (at least as of current). I‚Äôve told Chloe we need to figure out how we‚Äôre going to handle this because Emily has been taking advantage of Chloe since I met them and even before then. My idea is that they either need to get a job in a months time or they need to start actually taking care of the house and themselves aka therapy and that they will get a budget for their essentials and not the luxury 2-3 coffees they‚Äôve been getting every day for the past three years and if they choose to spend it on that instead of their essentials, too bad. If she can‚Äôt do it, she‚Äôs out. Chloe has been stuck on how to handle it and I don‚Äôt blame her - this is her family. I feel on the fence because at the end of the day, I don‚Äôt want her sister to fail - I see someone who is funny and smart and capable but refuses to act on any of it because it‚Äôs easier to rot and never be self critical and grow and in some small part, I can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt blame Chloe for enabling their bed-rotting, teenage boy habits and while I want to support them, their refusal to accept they have to work for the luxuries they want, that they have to grow and change to be in a healthy relationships, platonic or romantic, and complete denial of therapy options has driven me to become resentful of Emily and in a way at Chloe, who I love dearly. I believe Chloe is finally realizing the extent that Emily needs help but that they cannot give.

So Reddit - do we try to move forward and give them a month to figure this out (IE getting a job or getting therapy) or do we cut our losses and tell her to stay with her parents?

TL:DR - My girlfriend‚Äôs BPD sister had a full screaming meltdown at me telling me exactly how ‚Äúterrible‚Äù I am despite them not having a job, not contributing to the chores, and constantly being an emotional terrorist to me and her sister, who took them in four years ago after they showed up at her apartment unannounced. She comes back in a week, how do we go on?

Ever feel like you're constantly running on fumes, even after a full night's sleep? You hit snooze repeatedly, drag yourself out of bed, and coffee just doesn't seem to cut it anymore. You're not alone. Chronic fatigue is a beast, and it can steal your joy, productivity, and overall zest for life. Many people chalk it up to ""just getting older"" or ""being stressed,"" but what if there's a deeper, more treatable cause?

In my experience, when someone comes to me describing persistent, unexplained exhaustion, one of the first things I consider is their hormone levels-especially testosterone. While often associated with muscle and libido, testosterone plays a surprisingly huge role in your energy levels and overall vitality. Let's dive into how Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) might be the key to unlocking the energetic you that's been hiding.

## The Sneaky Link: Low T and Your Energy Tank

You might be thinking, ""Testosterone? Isn't that just for gym bros and older guys?"" And while it's true that testosterone levels naturally decline with age, low testosterone-or ""Low T""-can affect men of all ages. What's fascinating is how profoundly this decline impacts your energy.

Think of testosterone as a crucial fuel for your body's engine. When that fuel runs low, everything slows down. Your metabolism might get sluggish, your red blood cell production can dip, and even your brain function can feel fuzzy. It's like trying to drive a car with barely any gas in the tank-you just can't go far, and you certainly can't go fast.

Here's what I've learned about the connection:

* **Cellular Energy Production:** Testosterone is vital for mitochondrial function, which are essentially the powerhouses of your cells. Less testosterone means less efficient energy production at a cellular level.
* **Red Blood Cell Count:** Low T can lead to mild anemia, meaning fewer red blood cells to carry oxygen to your tissues. Less oxygen equals less energy.
* **Mood and Motivation:** Fatigue often comes hand-in-hand with low mood and lack of motivation, which are also symptoms of Low T. It's a vicious cycle.

## How TRT Can Flip the ""On"" Switch

So, if Low T is draining your energy, it stands to reason that restoring healthy testosterone levels could help, right? Absolutely. TRT aims to bring your testosterone back into an optimal range, and for many, the change in energy is one of the most significant and welcomed benefits.

When you start TRT, you're essentially giving your body the fuel it's been craving. This isn't an overnight miracle, mind you-it's a gradual process, but the improvements can be truly life-changing.

### What You Might Notice on TRT:

* **Waking Up Refreshed:** One of the most common reports I hear is a significant improvement in sleep quality and the ability to wake up feeling genuinely rested, not just ""less tired.""
* **Sustained Energy Throughout the Day:** Say goodbye to that midday slump. Many people find they have more consistent energy levels, allowing them to focus better at work, engage more with family, and even tackle hobbies they once loved.
* **Reduced Need for Stimulants:** That constant craving for coffee or energy drinks often diminishes. Your body starts producing its own energy more efficiently.
* **Improved Stamina:** Whether it's in the gym or just daily activities, you might notice you don't tire out as easily. This is actually pretty cool-it's like rediscovering your physical capacity.

It's important to understand that TRT isn't a ""cure-all"" for every type of fatigue. If your fatigue is due to poor diet, lack of sleep, or other medical conditions, TRT won't magically fix those. However, if Low T is the root cause, or a significant contributing factor, then TRT can be incredibly effective.

## Your Journey to Reclaiming Vitality

Finding out if TRT is right for you always starts with a conversation with a knowledgeable doctor. They'll run blood tests to check your testosterone levels, and discuss your symptoms, lifestyle, and medical history. This isn't something to self-diagnose or try to treat on your own.

If you're constantly battling chronic fatigue and suspect Low T might be playing a role, don't dismiss it. You deserve to feel energetic, engaged, and like your best self. Reclaiming your energy can open up so many doors-whether it's having the stamina to play with your kids, excelling in your career, or simply enjoying your life more fully. It's about feeling vibrant again, and that's a goal worth pursuing.",1,1750777265.0,TRTtracker,0,1.0,False

------------------------------------------------------------------

Ah, the South of France! Just the mention of it conjures up images of sun-drenched days, azure waters, and an undeniable air of chic sophistication. But beyond the glitz and glamour of Nice and the celebrity allure of Cannes, lies a coastline brimming with an incredible diversity of beaches, each offering its own unique charm and appeal. You might be dreaming of powdery white sands where you can sprawl out with a good book, or maybe you‚Äôre more the type to seek out secluded coves for a refreshing dip away from the crowds. Perhaps the thrill of watersports gets your heart racing, or maybe building sandcastles with your little ones is your idea of paradise. Whatever your beachy bliss looks like, trust me, the South of France has it in spades. So, buckle up, because we're about to embark on a delightful journey along this magnificent coastline, uncovering some of its most exquisite sandy (and sometimes pebbly) treasures. Get ready to swap those dreary thoughts for dreams of endless summer!

### The Allure of the C√¥te d'Azur: Where Glamour Meets the Sea

The C√¥te d'Azur, that illustrious stretch of coastline, practically invented the concept of the glamorous beach holiday. It‚Äôs where movie stars once mingled with royalty, and where the sun seems to shine a little brighter. Think shimmering yachts, designer bikinis, and waterfront restaurants serving up the freshest seafood imaginable. This part of the South of France just *breathes* sophistication, but don't let that intimidate you; there are plenty of spots for everyone, whether you're living large or just looking for a bit of sun and sea.

#### The Iconic Beaches of Nice: Pebbles with Panache

When one thinks of Nice, the Promenade des Anglais inevitably springs to mind, a grand boulevard hugging the curvaceous Bay of Angels. And what a bay it is! While Nice's beaches might be pebbly rather than sandy, don't let that deter you. These smooth, sun-warmed stones are surprisingly comfortable with a good towel, and they keep the water incredibly clear. Plus, it's pretty darn easy to shake off the sand at the end of the day!

- **Promenade des Anglais:** This isn‚Äôt just a beach; it‚Äôs an institution. Stretching for miles, it offers a breathtaking panorama of the turquoise Mediterranean. You'll find a mix of public and private beaches here. The public sections are bustling, vibrant, and totally free, perfect for those who love a lively atmosphere. If you‚Äôre craving a bit more luxury, the private beaches offer sun loungers, parasols, and often a waiter service, so you can truly relax without a care in the world. Think of it as your own little slice of heaven, complete with cocktails delivered right to your sunbed. Is that not the dream?
- **Plage de la R√©serve:** Just a short stroll east of the main promenade, towards the port, you'll discover this local favorite. It's a smaller, more intimate pebble beach, often with fewer crowds than its more famous counterparts. The water here is crystal clear, making it a fantastic spot for snorkeling. You'll also find some great little cafes nearby for a quick bite or a refreshing drink. It's got a wonderfully laid-back vibe, a stark contrast to the more bustling beaches closer to the city center.

#### Cannes: Red Carpet Sands and Beyond

Cannes. The very name evokes images of film festivals, celebrity sightings, and yachts big enough to be small countries. But beyond the star-studded events, Cannes also boasts some truly lovely beaches, particularly if soft sand is what you're after.

- **Plage de la Croisette:** This private beach hotspot, running alongside the famous Boulevard de la Croisette, is where you'll find the most exclusive beach clubs. Plush sun loungers, gourmet restaurants, and generally beautiful people are the order of the day here. It's a fantastic spot for people-watching, even if you just grab a coffee at a nearby caf√©. Yes, it can be pricey, but for a taste of that legendary Cannes glamour, it‚Äôs worth it. Plus, the sand is glorious!
- **Plage du Midi and Plage de la Bocca:** Head west from the Palais des Festivals, and you'll hit Plage du Midi. Continue a bit further, and you‚Äôll reach Plage de la Bocca. These public sandy beaches are much more family-friendly and far less crowded than their Croisette counterparts. They offer shallow waters, perfect for little ones splashing around, and plenty of space to set up your umbrella and enjoy a picnic. What a relief, right? You get all the beauty of Cannes without quite so much of the pomp.

### Escaping the Crowds: Hidden Gems and Secluded Coves

While the famous beaches certainly have their appeal, sometimes you just want to get away from it all and find a tranquil slice of paradise. The South of France, believe it or not, is home to a surprising number of secluded coves and less-trodden paths, perfect for those seeking peace, quiet, and unspoiled natural beauty. It takes a little more effort to find them, but believe me, the payoff is immense.

#### The L√©rins Islands: An Island Escape Near Cannes

Just a short ferry ride from Cannes, the L√©rins Islands offer a remarkable escape from the hustle and bustle of the mainland. They're a breath of fresh air, literally!

- **√éle Sainte-Marguerite:** Famous for its fortress that once imprisoned the Man in the Iron Mask (spooky, right?), this island is also home to fragrant pine and eucalyptus forests that lead down to beautiful, rocky coves. The water here is incredibly clear, ideal for snorkeling and swimming. You won't find sprawling sandy beaches, but rather charming inlets where you can lay out your towel on the sun-warmed rocks and enjoy the solitude. Pack a picnic, rent a bike, and spend the day exploring this serene oasis.
- **√éle Saint-Honorat:** Home to a community of Cistercian monks who produce their own wine and liqueurs, this island offers a truly unique experience. The beaches here are even more secluded and peaceful than on Sainte-Marguerite, with untouched coves perfect for a quiet swim. It's a place where time seems to slow down, allowing you to truly unwind and connect with nature. Imagine: sipping a locally-produced glass of ros√© while looking out at the shimmering Mediterranean. Pure bliss.

#### The Calanques National Park: A Hiker's and Swimmer's Delight

Nestled between Marseille and Cassis, the Calanques National Park is a geological marvel, an otherworldly landscape of towering white limestone cliffs plunging into turquoise inlets. It‚Äôs not just a park; it‚Äôs an adventure waiting to happen!

- **Calanque de Sormiou:** One of the most famous calanques, Sormiou boasts a stunning sandy beach at its base, complete with a small restaurant serving fresh seafood. Access can be tricky, as the road is often closed to cars during peak season, meaning a descent by foot is usually required (and a challenging hike back up!). But trust me, the views and the utterly pristine water make every step worth it. This place is seriously breathtaking.
- **Calanque d'En-Vau:** Often described as one of the most beautiful calanques, En-Vau is a dramatic, fjord-like inlet with incredibly clear, emerald-green water. Reaching it requires a challenging hike, or you can paddle in by kayak from Cassis. It's not for the faint of heart, but the reward is a truly unforgettable swimming experience in a virtually untouched natural setting. This is one of those places that will make your jaw drop and your Instagram feed explode.
- **Calanque de Port-Pin:** A more accessible option, Port-Pin offers a mix of pebbles, sand, and smooth rocks, making it easier to find a spot to relax. The water here is calm and inviting, perfect for a refreshing dip after a relatively easy hike from Cassis. It's a fantastic choice if you want to experience the Calanques without embarking on an epic trek.

### Family Fun and Watersports Havens: Beaches for Everyone

Not every beach day is about quiet contemplation. Sometimes, you want splashes, laughter, and a bit of adrenaline! The South of France delivers on that front too, with numerous beaches perfectly geared towards families with children or those who love to get active on the water.

#### Saint-Tropez's Pampelonne Beach: More Than Just Parties

While Saint-Tropez is synonymous with glitz and late-night revelry, its famous Pampelonne Beach actually offers a surprising array of family-friendly sections and watersports opportunities alongside its legendary beach clubs. It‚Äôs huge, so there‚Äôs room for everyone.

- **Plage de Tahiti:** One of the most famous (and historically one of the first nudist beaches, though now largely textile), Tahiti has a lively atmosphere with beachfront restaurants but also quieter stretches further down. The sand is fine, and the water is shallow and warm, making it good for families. You'll find water sports vendors offering everything from parasailing to jet-skiing.
- **Plage de l'Escalet:** If you're looking for something a bit more rugged and less ""seen and be seen"" near Saint-Tropez, head east to Plage de l'Escalet. It's a beautiful, wilder beach with a mix of sand and pebbles, surrounded by rocky outcrops perfect for exploring. The water is incredibly clear, and it's a popular spot for snorkeling and paddleboarding. It‚Äôs a bit of a drive, but totally worth it for the sense of escape.

#### Juan-les-Pins: A Lively Hub for All Ages

Nestled between Cannes and Nice, Juan-les-Pins is a vibrant resort town known for its jazz festival and beautiful sandy beaches. It‚Äôs perfect for those who want a lively atmosphere with easy access to amenities.

- **Plage de la Gallice:** This wonderfully shallow, sandy beach is ideal for families with young children. The water is calm, and there‚Äôs plenty of space for building sandcastles. You'll find nearby cafes and ice cream parlors, making it easy to spend a full day here.
- **Plage du Pont Dulys:** Another excellent sandy option, this beach offers a good mix of public and private sections. It's popular for watersports, with opportunities for parasailing, jet-skiing, and even inflatable rides. If you're looking to add a bit of thrill to your beach day, this is the place to be. You‚Äôll see plenty of banana boat rides going on here, trust me!

### The Var Coastline: A Mediterranean Dream

Moving west from the Alpes-Maritimes department, we enter the Var, a region renowned for its stunning coastline, fragrant pine forests, and charming Proven√ßal villages. This area offers a fantastic blend of popular resorts and tranquil havens, all bathed in that glorious Mediterranean light.

#### Porquerolles Island: A Car-Free Paradise

One of the Hy√®res islands (also known as the Golden Islands), Porquerolles is a gem of a place, largely protected and car-free. It‚Äôs a fantastic spot for cycling and exploring its numerous beautiful beaches.

- **Plage Notre Dame:** Consistently voted one of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, and for good reason! With its powdery white sand, incredibly clear turquoise water, and fringed by pine and eucalyptus trees, it truly is a slice of paradise. It‚Äôs a bit of a bike ride or walk from the village (about 45 minutes walking), but the peace and beauty you'll find here are absolutely worth the effort. It feels like stepping into a postcard.
- **Plage d'Argent:** Closer to the village and easily accessible, Plage d'Argent (meaning ""Silver Beach"") gets its name from the sparkling quality of its sand. It‚Äôs a very popular and well-equipped beach, with a restaurant and facilities, making it a great choice for families. The water is calm and inviting, perfect for a long, leisurely swim.

#### Cavalaire-sur-Mer: A Bay of Beauty

This charming resort town boasts a magnificent bay framed by green hills, and a long, sandy beach that‚Äôs perfect for relaxation and recreation.

- **Plage de Cavalaire:** Stretching for several kilometers, this wide, sandy beach is a fantastic all-rounder. It offers designated swimming areas, opportunities for various water sports, and plenty of space even in peak season. You'll find numerous beach restaurants and cafes lining the promenade, making it easy to grab a bite or a refreshing drink. It's got that quintessential French Riviera vibe, without being overly ostentatious.

### Practical Tips for Your South of France Beaches Adventure

So, you‚Äôre convinced, aren‚Äôt you? You're already picturing yourself basking in the sun, listening to the gentle lapping of the waves. But before you pack your bags and jet off, here are a few practical pointers to ensure your South of France beach holiday goes off without a hitch. Nobody wants a holiday mishap, right?

- **Sun Protection is Paramount:** This might seem obvious, but the Mediterranean sun is no joke! Pack high-factor sunscreen, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses. Consider a UV-protective rash guard, especially for children. Sunburn is a sure-fire way to ruin a good time.
- **Footwear Matters:** While flip-flops are great for sandy beaches, if you plan on exploring rocky coves or pebbly beaches (especially in Nice or the Calanques), water shoes or sturdy sandals are a godsend. Trust me, stubbing your toe on a sharp rock is not the vacation memory you want.
- **Embrace the Pebbles:** If you're heading to Nice, don't write off those pebble beaches! A thick towel or an inflatable beach mat will make all the difference. The clarity of the water is often a direct result of those smooth stones.
- **Public vs. Private:** Understand the difference. Public beaches (plages publiques) are free for all, but you'll need to bring your own towel, umbrella, and chairs. Private beaches (plages priv√©es or clubs de plage) charge a fee for loungers, parasols, and often offer food and drink service. They can be quite an expense, but sometimes, a bit of luxury is just what the doctor ordered.
- **Peak Season Crowds:** July and August are prime time, and beaches, especially the popular ones, can get very crowded. If you prefer a quieter experience, consider visiting in June or September when the weather is still beautiful, but the throngs have thinned out. Plus, accommodation and flights are often cheaper!
- **Getting Around:** A car offers the most flexibility for exploring the diverse coastline and those hidden gems. However, trains and buses connect many coastal towns, and ferries are essential for reaching the islands. Public transport can be a fantastic, cost-effective way to get around if you‚Äôre staying put in one area.
- **Learn a Few French Phrases:** While many people in tourist areas speak English, a few basic French phrases, even just ""Bonjour"" and ""Merci,"" will go a long way and are always appreciated by the locals. It shows you're making an effort, and that's never a bad thing.
- **Pack a Picnic (Sometimes):** While there are plenty of beachside restaurants, packing your own picnic (think fresh baguettes, local cheeses, olives, and a bottle of ros√©) can be a delightful and more economical way to enjoy lunch on the beach, especially on the more secluded spots.

### Your Beachy Bucket List: A Final Call to Action

1ljd8fq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ljd8fq,Gaps in Espresso Flow [MiiCoffee Apex V2 / DF64 Gen 2],"Hello, espresso novice here hoping for some insight on what I'm seeing!

Most of my pulls regardless of bean, basket, grind size (if it's relatively close ofc) seem to have these gaps in the espresso flow out of the portafilter. I'm inclined to say that it's channeling, but I'd appreciate a second opinion. If this was channeling, I'm curious why this appears throughout the dial-in process at several different grind sizes on both my single basket and double basket. This occurs even when brew times are reasonable in the 25-35s range.

I'm wondering if anybody has any experience with this and could point out if this is normal, and if not, point to possible issues in my technique or equipment configuraton that could cause this.

Nearly a year ago three things happened: 1, me (22m)  and my boyfriend (23m) started renting my stepdad‚Äôs old house. 2, my mom and stepdad‚Äôs house burnt down, and they were struggling to find a house big enough to accommodate the family. 3, they asked if my younger adult brother(21m) could move in with us since we had an extra room. 

My mother had floated the idea of my brother moving in with me for a while before this as well. It caused issues between her and my stepfather as he felt my mom babied him, and let him get away with doing nothing. The only reason my brother has a job is because my mom asked one of her friends to hire him. This was a big point of contention in their relationship and my mother has said if my brother didn‚Äôt move out when he did then they probably would be headed for divorce.

I want to clarify he is not high support needs or anything like that, in fact, my mother used to hold the fact that he had a higher IQ than me over my head. But he does not act like it. I feel like his Asperger‚Äôs diagnosis made my mom keep him from any responsibility. So, while he is quiet, and we don‚Äôt see him often (he works overnights) we still end up dealing with his mess.

This includes but is not limited to: washing all of his coffee cups because he never does any dishes , having to force him to clean his room because the floor is hidden by fast food bags and boxes, he drinks all our beer or alcohol without asking, he never takes out the trash, never sweeps or mops, never helps with outside work.

This all sort of came to a head last night/this morning. My boyfriend and I went out of town for a week and deep cleaned the house before we left. We asked my brother to watch/feed/water the cats and make sure the house stayed clean. When we got home, the house stank like body odor and cat piss. In the bathroom all of our towels were in a pile by the door and there were brown shit stains everywhere. Since we were tired, we just assumed the stains were from one of our cats, cleaned it, and then moved on. After that I went to the kitchen and made spaghetti. It‚Äôs worth noting that there is a sizable part of our kitchen ceiling missing, which leads to some pipes + a small maintenance door next to our toilet in the upstairs bathroom.

The next day, yesterday, after trying to pick up the towels, my boyfriend mentions he thinks that my brother overflowed the toilet while we were gone. We had also been having some mild food poisoning all day, and where the kitchen and bathroom are connected, I just got the worst feeling. I asked my brother if he had overflowed the toilet while we were gone. He said yes, he had. I didn‚Äôt really know what else to say so I asked him to clean up thoroughly. I feel like I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to say to him. How does a grown man not know to clean up his shit and piss? He left it all over our fucking bathroom. And because my boyfriend didn‚Äôt know the towels were used to soak up toilet water, he used one to dry his athletes foot that night. (I personally wouldn‚Äôt have used a towel that had been on the floor for this but I digress)

That brings us to this morning: my boyfriend is at the clinic because this morning his foot was super inflamed, covered in pus, and super painful. So this would mark two ways that we‚Äôve been affected physically by my younger brother not cleaning up after himself. I am at a total loss for what to do because he is my younger brother and I love him but I‚Äôm tired of playing caretaker for this grown man who is fully capable of taking care of himself. Growing up I was very parentified by our parents when it came to him and the rest of our siblings, moving out was supposed to be an escape from that. He is fully capable of cleaning up his own shit and piss instead of leaving messes for us to come home to. I feel If he is intelligent enough to brew his own mead and play intricate card games he‚Äôs intelligent enough to clean up after himself. 

WIBTA if I kicked out my adult brother with autism?

EDIT: my reasoning for thinking I might be the asshole is because my mom is always like ‚ÄúWell he‚Äôs autistic so you just have to tell him!! He doesn‚Äôt think about things the way we do!!‚Äù But like I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell a grown man to clean up his piss and shit. We were also homeschooled so he has like no social life and I don‚Äôt even know where he would go if we kicked him out (no one else in my family wants to take him in funnily enough) ",32,1750776542.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,28,0.97,False

I'm visiting MSP next Saturday evening (6/28/25) to Monday morning 6/30/25) and am looking for a few recommendations. I'm planning to ride the Grand Rounds (or most of it anyway) Sunday during the day on my trusty gravel steed.

Firstly, does anyone have a .gpx file they wouldn't mind sharing of the route, excluding laps around the lake? Lots available on Ride with GPS, but a lot of them are titled things like, ""Grand Rounds-ish,"" but I'd like as close to the \*official\* route as possible, given I'll be riding alone and am unfamiliar with the city. (Sidebar, wouldn't it be great if City/State entities who put these types of routes together could include .gpx files rather than .pdf or .img files? A gal can dream.) Planning to start near downtown and go clockwise from there. 

Secondly, what are your favorite places to stop on/near the route? Quick food stops, breweries, coffee shops, preferably where I wouldn't have to lock up a bike, with patio seating or seating near a window where I can keep my eye on the bike? I don't have a lock with me (I did not plan that far ahead). I know everyone recommends Sea Salt but I am not a person who enjoys eating seafood. In case it matters, I prefer West Coast IPAs over Hazies, love a good sour beer, and have a hard time saying no to delightful pastries.

I appreciate any/all recommendations you can throw my way! ",1,1750776508.0,CyclingMSP,5,0.67,False

SYNOPSIS: A murder, a mystery, and a not-so-overactive imagination...¬†

Eccentric heiress, Maida Westabrook, treasures her peaceful, ""ordinary"" life in California ‚Äî morning strolls along the beach, warm evenings by the fire, and losing herself in her beloved library of myths and legends. Yet Maida can‚Äôt shake the nagging feeling that there‚Äôs more to her story than she‚Äôs been led to believe. Strange and inexplicable occurrences have always surrounded her, dismissed as nothing more than her overactive imagination.¬†

When a distant relative mysteriously vanishes, a body is discovered, and Maida‚Äôs lifelong dream of owning an enchanted bookshop suddenly comes true, she realizes her ""wild"" imagination might not have been so far-fetched after all.¬†

There‚Äôs just one hitch: the sentient bookshop has gone into hiding, and it‚Äôs up to Maida to coax it back. To claim her inheritance, she must step out of her safe, predictable world and embrace a reality where magic is not only real, but is woven into the very fabric of everyday life. That handsome neighbor? He might be a shapeshifter. And the barista who runs the local caf√©? She‚Äôs likely brewing more than just coffee.¬†

As Maida unravels the secrets of her past, she‚Äôs forced to rethink everything she once held true. Saving the bookshop ‚Äî and protecting her newfound magical family ‚Äî will require more courage than she ever thought possible, and it might just involve risking her heart.¬†",1,1750776444.0,audiobooks,0,1.0,False

1ljczeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1ljczeb/we_accidentally_promoted_the_delivery_human/,We Accidentally Promoted the Delivery Human,"Room 17B was quieter than usual. That alone was enough to make the attending officials uncomfortable. Zinthari Admiral Rel‚Äôvaan, carapace polished to an uncharacteristic shine, tapped two of her fingers in rhythmic irritation against the hard glass surface of the review table. The chamber was sealed, the lights slightly dimmed, and the data node pulsed with the glow of an active case file.

‚ÄúLet the record show,‚Äù Rel‚Äôvaan said without preamble, ‚Äúthis is the formal review of Incident 113-Beta, designation: Unscheduled Command Execution, Sector 14-V. Playback and analysis requested by the Central Ethics and Oversight Committee. Access level: seared retina.‚Äù

A smaller figure to her left, a blue-chinned Yillian analyst barely out of hibernation, shuffled nervously with a datapad too large for her three-jointed fingers.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam,‚Äù the analyst said, voice thin, ‚Äúthe footage is‚Ä¶ unusual.‚Äù

Rel‚Äôvaan gave the kind of slow blink only the deeply exhausted or the criminally undercaffeinated could deliver. ‚ÄúThat would be consistent with the written report, Analyst Tierel. Please begin.‚Äù

The holoprojector activated with a low hum. A wide-angle security feed from the GC Forward Operations Center on Midway Bastion 14-V filled the center of the room. Time-stamped footage, 17:33 local station time. The entry hatch hissed open. Into frame walked a human male‚Äîslightly disheveled, red in the face, cradling a delivery bag marked RationRush: Hot in 30 Parsecs or Less! across his chest. The bag was steaming.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him?‚Äù asked Admiral Krellix, shifting in his seat. His tone was acidic.

‚ÄúCivilian designation Milo Griggs,‚Äù Tierel said. ‚ÄúEmployment status: junior quartermaster, planetary food services. Human Division 112-Kappa.‚Äù

‚ÄúJunior quartermaster,‚Äù Krellix repeated. ‚ÄúHe was delivering sandwiches.‚Äù

‚ÄúJalape√±o krill melts, according to the intake manifest.‚Äù

Onscreen, Milo fumbled with a badge, looked around, then paused at a security terminal. He held out a datapad‚Äîlikely his delivery log‚Äîand tapped it on the scanner.

The screen glitched.

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù Tierel said delicately, ‚Äúthis is where the‚Ä¶ misclassification occurred.‚Äù

The holofeed highlighted a blinking UI error. The station‚Äôs security AI interpreted the delivery manifest barcode as a Fleet Personnel Deployment form. Due to overlapping syntax in the outdated QR encoding format, the name M. Griggs was parsed as Lt. Cmdr. M. Grigs, Tactical Logistics Oversight. A fleet delegate, temporarily embedded.

A mechanical chirp indicated successful identification. Milo looked baffled as a security bot saluted and opened the inner blast doors for him.

‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real,‚Äù muttered a committee member.

‚ÄúWas he armed?‚Äù another asked.

‚ÄúOnly with mustard packets,‚Äù said Tierel.

The feed continued. Milo was waved through several security checkpoints, looking increasingly distressed but too confused to argue. By 17:41, he had wandered into the Sector 14-V Tactical Planning Annex‚Äîa classified strategic chamber then hosting an emergency operations review following an Esshar scouting raid.

Three GC officers in combat armor were gathered around a central holo-map. The command AI blinked at full brightness, awaiting input. A tense debate was underway about pulling forces from outer orbit to reinforce a retreating destroyer wing.

Milo tried to explain himself. He waved the bag. No one paid attention. One officer mistook his food pouch for a classified logistics packet and handed him a datapad in return.

‚ÄúBased on audio,‚Äù said Tierel, ‚Äúhe used several phrases common among mid-rank Fleet analysts: ‚Äònot authorized,‚Äô ‚Äòwrong room,‚Äô and ‚Äòneed confirmation,‚Äô which, unfortunately, are often interpreted by subordinate AI systems as signs of protocol initiation.‚Äù

They resumed playback.

Milo hesitated. The map glowed red. The AI blinked, waiting.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Milo muttered. ‚ÄúMaybe point the‚Ä¶ blue laser ships at the glowy part of the map? Like, where they‚Äôre clustering?‚Äù

The room was silent as the command AI logged the statement.

GC fleet assets repositioned.

Officers blinked. No one challenged the order‚Äîafter all, it came from someone with the correct clearance, currently holding two datapads, and wearing an expression of deep concentration.

‚ÄúOrders confirmed,‚Äù the AI said.

A second officer turned to Milo. ‚ÄúWhat secondary support package would you like deployed, Commander Grigs?‚Äù

Milo blinked. ‚ÄúUhh, something fast and annoying? Like, swarms?‚Äù

‚ÄúDeploying drone frigate wing.‚Äù

Rel‚Äôvaan didn‚Äôt speak. Her mandibles clicked once, tightly.

The feed switched to external visuals.

GC fleet assets‚Äîthree laser barges, a defensive cruiser, and two outmoded patrol skiffs‚Äîexecuted a perfect realignment. The Esshar flanking formation was caught mid-transition. One of their corvettes took a plasma rail to the hull and banked into its own jamming field. Comms traffic spiked, then collapsed. The drones hit their scouts within 90 seconds.

The entire skirmish ended within 14 minutes.

Esshar vessels retreated in disarray.

The holofeed ended.

No one moved.

Tierel cleared her throat.

‚ÄúThere was no Lt. Cmdr. M. Grigs,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúHe was there to deliver sandwiches.‚Äù

Admiral Krellix sat back slowly. ‚ÄúWe assigned command to a sandwich courier. And he won.‚Äù

A rustle of paper‚Äîactual paper‚Äîwas heard as someone at the far end of the table collapsed a printed report into their lap and muttered something in an untranslatable dialect.

Rel‚Äôvaan exhaled.

‚ÄúFlag his personnel record,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to‚Ä¶ sanitize the debrief before anyone else reads it.‚Äù

Analyst Tierel‚Äôs voice cut gently through the static.

‚ÄúCommittee, we now move to Phase Two of Incident 113-Beta. This includes the post-action debrief of the civilian involved, as well as follow-up responses from relevant command units and administrative protocols.‚Äù

Admiral Rel‚Äôvaan gestured without looking. ‚ÄúProceed.‚Äù

The recording opened on a small, utilitarian debrief room. Fluorescent lighting. Two GC personnel sat opposite the same human seen in the tactical footage‚ÄîMilo Griggs, now without his delivery bag but still wearing the faint grease stains on his collar. He was sipping a hydration pouch and looking extremely uncomfortable.

The GC officer began with a standard inquiry. ‚ÄúPlease state your name, species, and station designation.‚Äù

Milo blinked. ‚ÄúUh, yeah, sure. Milo. Griggs. Human. Planetary food services, EarthGov subbranch... uh‚Ä¶ Unit 112-Kappa, I think. Sandwich division.‚Äù

One of the interviewers paused. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not military?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I mean, I do logistics. Heat management. Rewrap protocols. Mostly for sandwiches. Sometimes soups.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet you gave strategic fleet orders.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to!‚Äù Milo raised both hands as if fending off a slow-moving hoverbike. ‚ÄúI thought it was like, a VR sim or something. Training stuff. You know how those Fleet officers are, always testing new people? I figured if I played along I‚Äôd get out faster.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou believed you were being evaluated?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ kind of? It was either that or, you know, military comedy hazing. Honestly, I thought someone had hacked my delivery route. I‚Äôve seen prank clips like that online.‚Äù

There was a pause.

Milo took another sip and added, ‚ÄúAlso, I‚Äôve played Fleet Sim Six. Twice. The original, not the expansion with diplomacy. I‚Äôm bad at that part.‚Äù

One of the interviewers leaned forward. ‚ÄúCan you explain your tactical intention when you ordered drone swarm deployment and mid-orbit flanking?‚Äù

Milo scratched the back of his neck. ‚ÄúHonestly? I just didn‚Äôt want to get yelled at. Or die. Or, you know‚Ä¶ drop the drinks. Those krill melts leak through the bags, and the cleaning fee comes out of your pay.‚Äù

Playback froze.

Tierel turned back to the committee. ‚ÄúEnd civilian debrief excerpt. Statement classification: Level 2 Non-Strategic. Cross-referenced with autonomous order logs for clarity.‚Äù

Another screen lit up. This time it showed the command AI‚Äôs logic cascade during the battle. Data nodes blinked rapidly across the display.

‚ÄúThe AI interpreted Mr. Griggs‚Äô phrasing as a high-priority adaptive command string,‚Äù Tierel explained. ‚ÄúThe error stemmed from the overlapping syntax of delivery routing matrices and fleet maneuver subroutines. The command tree labeled his speech pattern as a form of intuitive interface shorthand used by untrained embedded advisors.‚Äù

Krellix scoffed. ‚ÄúWe hard-coded fleet command AI to obey anyone who sounds like they‚Äôve read a training manual?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo avoid delays during emergencies,‚Äù Tierel replied.

‚ÄúThat seems optimistic.‚Äù

Tierel did not disagree.

The feed continued.

The committee‚Äôs expressions ranged from blank to visibly concerned. One even reached up to massage his own sensory stalk.

Rel‚Äôvaan finally spoke.

‚ÄúLet the record show that this committee recognizes both the failure of procedural oversight and the... creative resolution that followed. Let us move to administrative recommendations.‚Äù

Velliss, a bone-thin Krask logistics director, hissed with irritation. ‚ÄúPurge all food-delivery QR strings from command interfaces. Immediately. I want a firewall between lunch orders and orbital strike commands.‚Äù

Halvrin, who had thus far remained quiet, finally leaned forward. ‚ÄúThis is precisely why humans must never be near autonomous military systems. They radiate chaos.‚Äù

Rel‚Äôvaan tapped a claw on the desk. ‚ÄúThey radiate improvisation. And we are not here to assign cultural blame. We‚Äôre here to stop it from happening again.‚Äù

She took a breath. ‚ÄúDraft the following for internal update. New policy: civilian personnel are not to be left unattended in active tactical zones unless they are on fire. And even then, only if fire suppression is engaged.‚Äù

There was a quiet moment of acknowledgment.

The session ended. The holoscreen faded. Data nodes powered down. One exhausted committee member, eyes half-lidded, leaned back in his chair and mumbled, ‚ÄúAt least the coffee arrived on time.‚Äù",5,1750776277.0,OpenHFY,2,1.0,False

I struggle with really severe anxiety and have my entire life so going about my day without anxious thoughts and overthinking has been a game changer for me.

**Background**: Diagnosed with De Quervains in spring of 2024. Braced for one month based on doctor recommendation and did PT. It improved, but did not ever get back to 100%, so in January 2025, I got a cortisone shot. After three weeks, it really kicked in and I was at 100% mobility and no pain! However, in May 2025, it wore off. Dr. said a second shot would likely only provide temporary relief, so I went ahead and scheduled surgery for June 2025.

**Day 1/Surgery Experience:** Surgery was quick and easy. I did in under local and was done in 10-15 minutes. Vertical incision about 3/4 inch long. I was sent home with one stitch, gauze, and a wrapping style bandage that could easily be removed. I was mostly numb for the day, but had some pain in the evening. I iced and took ibuprofen. Per Dr's instructions, I stayed mostly immobile in my hand/wrist/thumb that day, as the numbing was strong enough that I might not feel the pain to tell me to stop moving it. Not allowed to get it wet until the stitches come out.

**Day 2**: I could touch my thumb to my first finger, but no further. Icing regularly and taking ibuprofen for pain. Keeping my arm elevated most of the day. No typing, etc. I could not have lifted my coffee cup with my hand.

**Day 3**: Took off the bulky wrapping and did a lighter wrapping, per Dr. instructions. I can touch my thumb to my first four fingers, but not to my pinky. Still icing and taking ibuprofen.

**Day 4**: I can touch my pinky! Still icing and taking ibuprofen.

**Day 5**: Can pick up light objects (ie: my phone) without using my thumb. Can type, including using my thumb for the spacebar. Worked half a day, and that was probably my limit. Icing periodically.

**Day 6-9**: Increasingly able to work longer, pick up heavier things (but still under 5 lbs or so, per Dr instrux), and feeling less and less discomfort. Icing occasionally.

**Day 10**: Stitches removed and steristrips removed! My thumb mobility is hugely better. My wrist mobility bending forward is probably about 70% of normal, and backwards about 90% of normal. PT/Dr. expect this to improve further. At this point, I am free to start really building it back up to normal. Also started scar massage today.

Overall, the recovery to be able to work a desk-style job was pretty quick! I am really happy I did it overall, and while I'm not at 100% mobility, it is much better than it was. Definitely recommend!

Now on to the tea, it's a long one. 

Before you read it has topics of child ab**e and domestic ab**e but no details, and slooislide is mentioned. 

I'm a woman in my 40s and I hate going to my childhood home. I was s*x**lly ab**ed as a child by my mothers brother and a neighbour. And physically hit by her best friend. She still sees that best friend to this day. I don't want to go in to it all, but needless to say nothing was done to protect me. My own mother even wanted them back in to my home and Dad didn't want to argue with her so she won, and they were allowed in. The disturbing thing is that from what I remember the brother of my mother was found out officially and banned from seeing me until I was 16. I even remember the weird sessions involving a lady and a doll. Mother broke that rule and nothing was done. He was back in our home within a year. I remember hearing a smashing sound as a child and Mum yelling. (I found out in later life that she aimed a plate or cup at his head, but it missed and hit the wall behind him) I regrettably can't be sure if was the same time. But Dad was either too scared to argue, or didn't have the energy. The only rule Dad could enforce was that none of them could babysit us kids (three girls, I was the oldest). The best friend hated that and even tried to pick us up from school when I was 10, and my baby sister was 5. She claimed mum was unwell and sent her. I stopped my sisters from getting in the car, as I had a weird feeling, the best friend got annoyed and then Dad walked around the corner and lost it at her. She hadn't been sent by mother. Mother still kept her as a best friend even after that. Dad was not happy, neither was I. I was so scared the whole time we had guests, or Dad was out, and could never feel safe at home, now I had to be on guard outside school, aswel as dealing with bullies in school. I could never relax, never let my guard down. The ab**se started when I was just 4 years old, tge bullying when I was just 5. The extreme fear when was just 8. I was very much alone in my life battles from that age. I was bullied throughout school, so I had no peers to turn to, and I learned to just get on with it. If either of the monsters turned up my Dad would say he was going out and I would beg to go with him. And we had to wait inside the school gates in case of mothers friend showing up. I still don't know what she planned to do with us, but it scared me to think about, still does sometimes. Most times when I begged Dad took me when he went out, but others I spent sitting with my sisters and making sure we were never alone with either of those monsters, sorry I couldn't think of any other word for them. Mum didn't care about what happened, so long as she had her people around her. Even argued her case with Dad and he backed down. He didn't like to argue. So instead the place I should have felt safest I felt most scared. My only safety was taking my sisters to feed the horses in the local field and play in the woods, just be outside and make the most of daylight. Even went out when it rained. I felt safe going to our Grandparents on Dads side. His family never was told anything of this, so I don't think they even know now. I haven't told them, wouldn't know how. At night I had my bedroom. In there I could be me, listen to heart radio, write stuff, draw stuff, play with my imaginary friends, and feel safe for a couple of hours, but I had increasingly scary nightmares, so those couple of hours got longer because I wouldn't sleep. I was barely getting 3 hours sleep a night. My GCSEs were done running on fumes. Work was the same, I was frequently exhausted and even collapsed at work. I tried to be out as ofren as pos,turned to drinking with friends and running security on a youth club. It kept me away from home. I left home at 21  got married and had two kids. I thought I was escaping. But out of the frying pan into the fire. Sadly that husband was ab**ive and the pattern followed me until 2 years ago. I now have a good partner who was a long time friend and has always been there for me. He saved me from the last ab**ive relationship so I'm actually now safe, just trying to get used to that feeling, which is very strange. I still look over my shoulder I still apologise for every tiny thing and panic, I still get scared, and still have trauma dreams. My partner is so patient and caring and holds me tight every time I wake up screaming or sweating. He makes me laugh on very dark days and makes me feel safe and protected. I still feel like an idiot for falling into those past relationships and blame myself more often than not. But I smile for everyone and get on with it. Only my closest friends and partner know the truth of how bad things got. And where my mental health stands now. When I was in my mid twenties, I found out that mothers brother done it to my sisters too. I lost it and when I saw him stood outside our childhood home smoking, I'm not ashamed to say I punched him and told him to stay away. Back then I punched like a man, so it hurt. He stood stunned and I went in to see Dad and mother, he left pretty quickly after that. I assume that he realised I wasn't that scared little girl anymore. Hurting me was one thing, but my sisters, that crossed the line. Mother didn't stop her brother visiting until I had left home and he had tried to grape her. She hasn't seen him since. In that moment I realised that she only ever cared about herself and I was done. My Dad is a good man, but nothing I do is good enough. I helped look after my sisters, helped care for Mum when she came out of hospital (health complications related to alcohol and paranoid Schizophrenia), I was at the hospital nearly every day with Dad, was their meals on wheels though lockdown, and ran to hospital every time he was admitted for various things. All very much the duty of the eldest child, so I'm not complaining about helping them. Even after all the help I gave him and mother, raising two kids alone, volunteering at a club for twenty plus years which I often managed too, and doing my best he still calls me lazy, belittles my efforts and makes me feel small and stupid. He even said to me once when I asked for help in tough times ""I'm doing this for the kids, if you had no kids I wouldn't be helping."" That hurt like hell. But I love him to bits and don't ever want to be the reason he hurts. He raised us girls and loved us, he knew how to make us laugh, taught me to cook, taught me to change a nappy when I was 5, and taught me morals and discipline. He could have left when we were teens but he stayed for us. Mum tried to commit slooislide around the same time. So whether that was connected I couldn't say. But it's possible. 
Then we have my sister, she slept with my then boyfriend 15 years ago, even done it in what was my childhood bedroom, and did so for 2 months. She denied it until he cheated on her a few months later, then she spilled the beans but blamed him entirely. I still can't forgive or trust her even now, especially since she slept with an ex just before having that affair behind my back. She evn flirts with my partner now, and it freaks him out, he feels very uncomfortable around her. I've warned her off of him, but she just seems to see that as a challenge. I tried to cut her out of my life, but she's dads favourite and the sun shines brightly out from between her butt cheeks. So he begged for me to let it go and come to Christmas. As he hurt him to see us split. I buckled, but I would prefer to never see her again. 
Most of mothers family are monsters, only four of the eight siblings were not, two of whom crossed the bridge to the other side, and one disowned the family and ran with her husband and kids, I don't blame her but I miss her. Grandad created the monsters, I don't think I need to explain how, and Nan hid and protected them. I have disowned the ones who are left except one uncle, and my late aunts widower and my cousin. The too don't talk to the monsters of that family. Sadly due to all this my childhood home and the family attached to it causes anxiety and nightmares. I can't hear mothers voice on the phone because it makes my body tense, so I avoid calling as much as possible. Seeing her causes flashbacks. When Christmas rolls round or any other family meals, I dread going back there. I break out in sweats, my heart beats oddly, and often end up crying before and after. My whole body tenses up. But I go for Dad and my youngest sister and my nieces. I often go to the garden just to breath. I hate being there, it's truly my hell. My best friends and my partner worry for me and think I should walk away. I want to walk away but I love my Dad and my baby sister, and my kids adore my Dad. He thankfully comes here for coffee and lunches, he's only ten minutes drive down the road. We enjoy our catch ups over coffee. It's only at Christmas and important family gatherings that I have to go back there. I'm told things will continue to haunt me if I don't cut ties, and I know it's true, and I hate that it's true. I love Dad and his family, I love my baby sister and nieces. But the flashbacks when I see mother or enter that house destroys me. The pain becomes physical because I'm so tense and filled with stress. I've been diagnosed with CPTSD, anxiety, OCD, and severe depression. It had gotten so bad that I had thoughts of slooislide and sadly caused myself physical harm. I won't go into details, just typing this up is hard enough, but I'm lost and need unbiased opinion. Going back to that hell sets off all of them. I don't want to lose Dad or my baby sister, and want to find a way of still keeping them in my life if possible, but I know cutting ties with mum and that sister would hurt Dad and confuse his family. But I need to for my mental health. I'm so torn. If I don't cut ties what other choices would I have?

I know how discouraging it can feel when attorney after attorney tells you your investment is ‚Äútoo low‚Äù or ‚Äútoo risky.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly what I went through.

I came to the U.S. from Mexico on a B-2 tourist visa with a simple plan, I wanted to build something real  a business that made sense, had demand, and that I could grow. I didn‚Äôt have a massive investment amount, but I believed in the concept. I spent time doing the research, testing ideas, building projections, and putting together a model that showed this could work and support me and my wife here legally.

I talked to multiple attorneys and consultants, and they all told me NO and wanted me to increase my investment amount which i did not have. They simply didn‚Äôt want to touch my case because of the modest investment. But then I found [GarciaFrenchLaw.com](http://GarciaFrenchLaw.com), and they took my case. On April 7, 2025, their team filed a Change of Status application with USCIS to switch me from B-2 to E-2. They didn‚Äôt just see only our numbers. They saw our structure, planning, and a viable path forward. The filing included me and my wife, and the total legal package cost us $10,000, including the E-2 business plan, and full representation. We added premium processing, and our case was approved just 23 days later.

The business I launched is a Healthy Smoothie & Coffee Mobile Cart based in Phoenix Arizona. I invested $43,000 total that covered the small used trailer, permits, setup, inventory. I also hired one barista full time to help me run it. The idea is simple. High quality, health focused drinks in high-foot traffic areas.

If you have a lower investment amount like me , and people are telling you that your investment is too small don‚Äôt give up. Find people who believe in your vision, build a real plan, and take the shot. ",7,1750775951.0,e2visa,2,1.0,False

1ljcs7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/GimkitBlooketHub/comments/1ljcs7d/gimkit_farmchain/,Gimkit Farmchain,"  
Let‚Äôs talk about Farmchain.

Gimkit Farmchain is a 2D cooperative farming game mode in Gimkit where players work together (or compete) to grow crops, collect resources, and manage in-game currency like energy, water, and money.

Most players are busy grinding in Snowbrawl or going wild in Don't Look Down but very few actually get how cool Farmchain is. I mean, yeah, it's not the flashiest mode out there. But once you play? It's got layers.

I started playing Farmchain just for fun during a late-night Gimkit session with friends. Next thing I know? We‚Äôre forming full-on strategies, optimizing our crop output, and yelling at each other to get more water from the well.

At its core, Farmchain is a 2D cooperative farming sim inside Gimkit. But it‚Äôs more than just planting corn and calling it a day.

Some features I like about it:

**1. Collaboration**

Farmchain forces you to work together either in teams or as one big group. No lone wolves here. If someone slacks on energy or doesn‚Äôt water their crops in time, the whole team suffers. And when it clicks? It's one of the most satisfying team-based modes.

**2. Four game modes = endless replayability**

You can go all-in on co-op, split into two teams, three teams, or go full free-for-all. Every style of play forces different strategies. It doesn‚Äôt feel repetitive like some other modes.

**3. Currency system is surprisingly deep**

Farmchain introduces energy, money, water, and research as different in-game currencies. Each of them plays a unique role. Watering crops costs water. Research unlocks better plants. Energy is your fuel for everything. It‚Äôs not just mindless answering; you actually have to think.

**4. The crops are fun (and weird)**

You start with corn (obviously), but quickly unlock stuff like potatoes, grapes, even coffee beans and oranges. And let‚Äôs not ignore the legendary GimBerry. If you‚Äôve ever seen someone farm that successfully, it‚Äôs a flex.

Also: Coffee beans go bad in 30 seconds. Yes, really.

**5. Hidden Easter Eggs**

There's a random patch of corn quoting the viral ""It‚Äôs Corn"" meme. You can interact with it. No joke. You literally get free corn for appreciating corn. Gimkit devs are on another level with these jokes.

There‚Äôs also writing on the chalkboards in the research lab teasing future updates. They lowkey foreshadowed Snowbrawl and Gimkit Creative right here in Farmchain.

**Tips from a player who got way too into this mode:**

* Don‚Äôt waste energy early game. Get just enough to unlock basic crops and stack cash fast.
* Water is slow to collect. Hit the junkyard early and grab trash yes, it‚Äôs a thing.
* Research wisely. Not every crop is worth the investment at the start.
* In Free For All mode, speed is everything. Grapes > potatoes > wheat.

1ljcrfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ljcrfk/starting_today_no_more_25_star_bonuses_for/,Starting today no more 25 star bonuses for personal cups  üòû,"I hate the new Starbucks CEO. And since I don't invest in Starbucks I know he's not there for me. I'm just a customer. He's there for the investors and the board.

I loved feeling like I was collecting and using stars to save enough money to justify Starbucks on a very regular basis or even daily.

But the CEO stopped that and now there are only a fraction of the opportunities to earn stars. 

And since Starbucks goes through millions and millions of paper and plastic cups every day I thought it was a great idea that they incentivize people to bring their own reusable cup. But the CEO must've calculated that that costs Starbucks more than it saves and therefore is no good.

The problem with the CEO's theory is that there are two groups of people who are extremely regular/loyal Starbucks customers. One is the slightly more affluent that doesn't care at all about stars and doesn't bother collecting them. And then there are people who are certainly not poor, but not so affluent. It's harder for them to go to Starbucks regularly and so they use all the specials that are on the app and collect stars and do things like that to save money.

So while the first group of uber loyal Starbucks customers won't be impacted by this at all, the second group will be. And that includes me.

It's a great time to switch to my local coffee shop and support a mom and pop outfit instead of a publicly traded company that exists really only for the shareholders at the end of the day.

## VII. Overall Probability Table: Key Scenarios and Investment Implications

This table synthesises the insights gleaned from the exhaustive time-series forensic analysis of aTyr Pharma's filings, presenting key scenarios and their associated probabilities. These probabilities reflect the cumulative weight of the evolving corporate narrative, the hidden signals, and the strategic actions undertaken by management over the past five years, providing an institutional-grade framework for assessing the risk-reward profile of $ATYR as it approaches its pivotal catalyst.

| Scenario/Narrative (Time-Series Informed) | Probability | Rationale & Implications (Drawing from Forensic Analysis) |
|---|---|---|
| **FDA Approval if EFZO-FIT Data is Clinically Meaningful and Clean** | 80‚Äì85% | **Rationale:** Consistent, progressive shift in company narrative from ""no established pathway"" to explicit BLA submission planning. Aggressive pre-commercialisation spend from 2024 onwards. Sustained positive DSMB reviews. EAP driven by blinded investigator/patient feedback (a strong qualitative signal). Management's forward-looking statements show increasing confidence, implying strong internal data. <br>**Implication:** Significant re-rating of current $493M market cap towards multi-billion dollar potential. Rapid commercialisation initiation. |
| **Full Direct US Launch is Base Case Strategy** | 75‚Äì85% | **Rationale:** Explicit increase in G&A spend for ""pre-commercialisation efforts"" (marketing, commercial operations, supply chain) from 2024. Board composition evolving to include commercial expertise (e.g., Eric Benevich). MD&A narrative clearly outlines U.S. launch preparedness as default. <br>**Implication:** Higher revenue capture for aTyr; signals management's confidence in executing commercially. |
| **Japan/APAC Launch Rapidly Follows US Approval (via Kyorin)** | 85‚Äì90% | **Rationale:** Kyorin partnership evolved from initial validation to fully integrated ""strategic engine"" funding development/commercialisation in Japan. PMDA Orphan Drug Designation secured. Ongoing material sales to Kyorin. This demonstrates established, de-risked international launch pathway. <br>**Implication:** Significant, near-immediate ex-US revenue stream, often underpriced by market, accelerating global market penetration. |
| **No Major New Dilution Pre-Readout** | >85% | **Rationale:** Consistent ""sufficient to meet material cash requirements for at least one year"" statement across 2023, 2024, and Q1 2025 filings, explicitly covering the Q3 2025 readout. Strategic capital raises in earlier periods funded this runway. <
**Implication:** Mitigates financing overhang, reducing risk of value destruction from distressed capital raise prior to key data. Allows maximum focus on catalyst. |
| **Robust Pipeline Expansion and New Indication Pursuits Post-Approval** | 90‚Äì95% (if EFZO-FIT is Positive) | **Rationale:** Strategic shift to focus on efzofitimod during pivotal phase implies resources held for expansion. Consistent narrative around EFZO-CONNECT (SSc-ILD) and next-gen assets (ATYR0101/0750) throughout later filings. Broad IP estate supports multiple indications/assets. <br>**Implication:** Transforms aTyr into a multi-product, multi-indication platform company, significantly increasing long-term valuation and diversifying risk beyond initial sarcoidosis indication. |
| **Manufacturing/Supply Chain Challenges Impact Initial Launch** | 25‚Äì35% | **Rationale:** New, more explicit CDMO/manufacturing risk language appears from 2024 onwards, with details about potential BLA delays and funding needs. While this shows vigilance, it's a new, specific risk for the commercialisation phase. <br>**Implication:** Potential delays to product launch, slower initial revenue ramp, or increased operational costs. This is a key area to monitor, indicating the increasing complexity of a maturing company. |
| **EFZO-FIT Phase 3 Readout is Ambiguous or Fails** | 15‚Äì20% | **Rationale:** While management's actions and narrative signals indicate high confidence, clinical trials always carry inherent risk. The ""no established regulatory pathway"" for sarcoidosis adds a layer of uncertainty, as even positive data might face unique regulatory hurdles. <br>**Implication:** Severe downside, as current market cap implies significant potential. Likely leads to immediate unwinding by event-driven funds, significant restructuring, and re-evaluation of long-term viability or strategic alternatives. |
| **Efzofitimod's ""Steroid-Sparing"" Benefit is Primary Commercial Wedge** | 90‚Äì95% | **Rationale:** Consistent time-series emphasis in competitive and market opportunity narratives on reducing/eliminating steroid use as efzofitimod's unique advantage. Aligns with patient-centric clinical endpoints (steroid reduction). <br>**Implication:** This will be the core of their commercial messaging and market access strategy, potentially driving strong adoption in a patient population burdened by steroid side effects. |
| **Post-Approval Capital Raise is Imminent (Post-Q3 2025 Data)** | 90% | **Rationale:** Current cash runway is stated to last for ""at least one year"" (from March 2025 10-K), covering Q3 2025 readout. However, aggressive commercial build-out will require substantial additional funding for sales force, marketing, and inventory. <br>**Implication:** Expect a dilutive offering post-positive data, likely at a significantly higher valuation. This is a planned strategic move to fuel launch, not a distressed raise. |

## VIII. Forensic ‚ÄúCheat Sheet‚Äù for Investors: What to Watch Now, with Enhanced Detail and Forward Projections

Having meticulously dissected aTyr Pharma's narrative, strategic shifts, and hidden signals across its time-series filings, we can distil these insights into a powerful ""cheat sheet"" for investors. This section provides actionable guidance on what to watch for in real-time, allowing our community to anticipate market moves and identify confirming or disconfirming signals that others might miss. This is about converting deep forensic analysis into a practical edge.

- **Commercial Hiring Acceleration:**  
  - *What to Watch:* Closely monitor aTyr's job postings on their corporate website and professional networking sites (like LinkedIn) for an acceleration in commercial, sales, and market access roles. This includes positions like Head of Sales, Regional Sales Directors, Marketing Managers, Market Access Specialists, and Reimbursement Analysts. Look for an increase in the number and seniority of these roles.  
  - *Why It Matters (Time-Series Signal):* A continued and aggressive build-out of the commercial team, particularly in the weeks and months leading up to and immediately following the Q3 2025 readout, would be a profound bullish signal. As evidenced by the time-series analysis of their financials (increased G&A) and MD&A, management has explicitly signalled pre-commercialisation efforts since 2024. A further ramp-up in hiring beyond current levels would confirm heightened internal conviction and readiness for an aggressive, direct U.S. launch. This is a tangible financial commitment that precedes public announcements and reflects management's belief in the high probability of approval.

- **Platform Narrative Shifts (Post-Catalyst):**  
  - *What to Watch:* After the EFZO-FIT readout, observe the nature and frequency of company communications regarding the broader tRNA synthetase platform (e.g., ATYR0101, ATYR0750, or new discoveries).  
  - *Why It Matters (Time-Series Signal):* A premature or sudden pivot back to heavily emphasising the broader platform, or announcing new preclinical programmes before strong positive EFZO-FIT data is confirmed and commercial plans are well underway, could subtly signal internal doubts about the lead asset's strength. It might imply an attempt to diversify investor focus away from a potentially less-than-stellar readout. Conversely, a strong, well-resourced push on pipeline development immediately post-positive data would be a powerful confirmation of the ""pipeline in a product"" hypothesis, signalling rapid reinvestment and long-term value creation. The timing of these shifts will be critical for interpreting management's true confidence in the lead asset.

- **Kyorin Milestones and Communications:**  
  - *What to Watch:* Monitor for public announcements related to new Kyorin milestone payments (up to the remaining $155M) or joint press releases regarding regulatory or commercial progress in Japan/APAC.  
  - *Why It Matters (Time-Series Signal):* Timely achievement of Kyorin milestones would reinforce the Japan narrative and provide additional non-dilutive capital, further strengthening the company's balance sheet. Consistent and positive communications from both aTyr and Kyorin regarding their partnership would indicate continued alignment and a smooth path towards commercialisation in Japan. This provides a leading indicator of success in a significant international market, where the foundation has been built over multiple years.

- **CDMO Updates and Supply Chain Status:**  
  - *What to Watch:* Scrutinise Q2 and Q3 10-Qs, and any interim news, for explicit mentions of manufacturing delays, cost overruns, or supply chain disruptions. Pay attention to any language regarding commercial inventory build-up or validation of their new CDMO.  
  - *Why It Matters (Time-Series Signal):* The increased prominence of CDMO/manufacturing risks in recent filings (from 2024 onwards) suggests this is an active operational concern as commercialisation nears. While a risk, its explicit mention also signals foresight. Any negative updates here would be a red flag, potentially delaying launch. Conversely, positive updates or the absence of new issues would indicate smooth operational execution for commercial supply, validating management's proactiveness.

- **Insider Activity (Form 4 Filings):**  
  - *What to Watch:* Actively monitor SEC Form 4 filings for additional insider buying, particularly by executive officers (CEO, CFO, Chief Medical Officer, Chief Commercial Officer).  
  - *Why It Matters (Time-Series Signal):* While the prior director buy (Jane Gross, March 2025) was a positive signal, sustained or significant purchases by key executives close to the catalyst would represent a direct, tangible confirmation of deep internal conviction. Insiders have the most complete view of the company's trajectory. Conversely, any unusual selling (absent pre-scheduled plans or option exercises) could be a warning sign. The magnitude and timing of such transactions, particularly in the ""quiet before the storm"" phase, are highly telling.

- **Share Count Stability:**  
  - *What to Watch:* Keep a close eye on the outstanding share count reported in subsequent filings and public statements.  
  - *Why It Matters (Time-Series Signal):* If the share count remains relatively flat through the readout (compared to the significant dilution in earlier years), it suggests sustained financial runway as previously indicated by management. This minimises the risk of a dilutive capital raise before the data. A stable float, particularly with high institutional ownership, can lead to a ""float squeeze"" on positive news, amplifying price movements due to limited available shares for new buyers. Any unexpected, large increases in share count could imply unforeseen expenditures or internal strategic shifts.

- **EAP Numbers/OLE Expansion:**  
  - *What to Watch:* Monitor any company-initiated announcements regarding increasing patient numbers in the Expanded Access Programme (EAP), or the potential for a broader Open-Label Extension (OLE) for EFZO-FIT patients after the initial Individual Patient EAP period.  
  - *Why It Matters (Time-Series Signal):* The EAP, driven by blinded investigator/patient feedback, is a powerful qualitative signal of perceived efficacy. An increase in EAP patient enrolment or the initiation of a broader OLE would be incredibly bullish, indicating growing genuine demand and potentially signalling preparation for an expanded label post-approval. This time-series progression of EAP activity directly correlates to clinical confidence and real-world adoption interest, providing strong qualitative support for the impending data.

- **Sarcoidosis Market Developments:**  
  - *What to Watch:* Monitor broader developments in the pulmonary sarcoidosis market, including competitor trial readouts (e.g., Molecure‚Äôs OATD-01, Kinevant‚Äôs namilumab) and evolving treatment guidelines from medical associations.  
  - *Why It Matters (Time-Series Signal):* While aTyr focuses on its unique ""steroid-sparing"" benefit, the evolving competitive landscape will shape its long-term market penetration. Positive or negative data from rivals could impact market perceptions and pricing power. Efzofitimod‚Äôs unique mechanism could position it favourably even with competition, and its time-series narrative of unique mechanism and patient benefits will be critical in this evolving landscape.

By actively monitoring these specific signals, investors can move beyond reacting to headlines and instead leverage a deep, time-series understanding of aTyr Pharma's strategic intent and operational realities, closing the information gap and positioning themselves effectively for the upcoming catalyst.

## IX. Summary and Conclusion: The Culminating Investment Thesis

This extensive forensic deep dive into aTyr Pharma‚Äôs 10-K and 10-Q filings from 2021 through Q1 2025 reveals a compelling narrative of strategic evolution, underpinned by a systematic and deliberate transformation. What began as a broad, exploratory biotech has, over time, meticulously refocused its resources and communications, becoming an ""all-in"" entity poised at the precipice of a pivotal Phase 3 readout for efzofitimod. This multi-year journey, invisible to the casual observer, is now culminating, presenting a unique investment thesis forged from the hidden patterns of corporate disclosure.

### Recap of Key Time-Series Insights:

- **From Diversification to Laser Focus:** The narrative consistently progressed from a broad platform exploration (2021‚Äì2022) to a singular, unwavering commitment to efzofitimod (2023‚Äì2025). This was evidenced by the culling of non-core pipeline assets and the concentrated allocation of capital towards the lead programme.
- **Confidence in the ""Pipeline in a Product"":** Beyond sarcoidosis, the strategic pursuit of label expansion for efzofitimod into other ILDs (e.g., SSc-ILD via EFZO-CONNECT) and the sustained mention of specific next-generation preclinical assets (ATYR0101/0750) reveal a meticulously planned long-term growth trajectory, driven from within the filings.
- **Diminishing Fear, Increasing Intent:** The progressive shift in risk factor emphasis, particularly concerning regulatory hurdles, from stark warnings to actively managed challenges, reflects a growing internal confidence in navigating the pathway to approval.
- **Kyorin: From Partner to Global Engine:** The Kyorin collaboration evolved from mere validation to an integrated operational engine, de-risking and accelerating the path to commercialisation in Japan/APAC, a testament to the company's foresight in global market entry.
- **Financial Discipline for the Catalyst:** Financial statements consistently showcase strategic capital raises and prudent cash management, ensuring a clear runway through the pivotal readout and enabling a focused sprint to market entry, confirming management's belief in the timing of their catalyst.
- **Commercial Readiness from the Filings:** The increasing allocation of G&A resources to ""pre-commercialisation efforts"" and the explicit language of ""transitioning to a commercial pharmaceutical company"" demonstrate tangible investments in commercial infrastructure, signalling a high degree of preparedness for launch.
- **The Language of Conviction:** A deep dive into lexical and semantic shifts reveals a progressive adoption of confident, execution-oriented terminology, hinting at accumulating positive internal data that guided management's strategic choices.
- **Board Re-engineering for the Next Phase:** Subtle changes in board composition, introducing commercial and market access expertise, underscore a strategic realignment of leadership for post-approval execution, reinforcing the commitment to a direct launch.
- **Unspoken Market Opportunity:** The company's narrative consistently amplifies the severity of disease burden and limitations of current therapies, implicitly building a compelling case for a substantial market opportunity, guiding strategic decisions without needing external numerical data.
- **Hidden Signals of Demand:** The emergence of the EAP, driven by ""blinded investigator and patient feedback,"" stands as a powerful, organic qualitative signal of perceived clinical benefit, adding another layer of confidence to the clinical story.

### Consolidated Hypotheses and Probabilities:

- **FDA Approval if EFZO-FIT Data is Clinically Meaningful and Clean:** 80‚Äì85% Probability.
- **Full Direct US Launch is Base Case Strategy:** 75‚Äì85% Probability.
- **Japan/APAC Launch Rapidly Follows US Approval (via Kyorin):** 85‚Äì90% Probability.
- **No Major New Dilution Pre-Readout:** >85% Probability.
- **Robust Pipeline Expansion and New Indication Pursuits Post-Approval (if EFZO-FIT is Positive):** 90‚Äì95% Probability.
- **EFZO-FIT Phase 3 Readout is Ambiguous or Fails:** 15‚Äì20% Probability.
- **Efzofitimod's ""Steroid-Sparing"" Benefit is Primary Commercial Wedge:** 90‚Äì95% Probability.
- **Post-Approval Capital Raise is Imminent (Post-Q3 2025 Data):** 90% Probability.

### The Investment Thesis Reaffirmed:

This exhaustive forensic analysis, drawing exclusively from the nuanced, time-series narrative embedded within aTyr Pharma's official filings, profoundly reinforces the investment thesis: $ATYR is a high-conviction catalyst play currently trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic potential. The company's consistent strategic pivots, meticulous operational preparations, and transparent communication of its long-term vision paint a picture of a management team that is not merely hoping for a positive outcome, but has rigorously prepared for it.

The current market valuation ($4.97 share price, $493 million market cap) significantly underprices the substantial multi-billion dollar total addressable market that efzofitimod is positioned to capture across seven major global markets, and its potential for $2.5 billion in peak global sales. This disconnect between public perception and the company's internal strategic confidence represents a significant information asymmetry, poised for re-rating upon positive data.

### Concluding Outlook:

As $ATYR approaches its pivotal Q3 2025 readout, the accumulated evidence from its filings suggests a company that has methodically engineered its path to commercial success. The converging signals‚Äîfrom linguistic shifts to financial allocations, and from pipeline prioritisation to leadership realignment‚Äîall point towards a leadership team that is strategically posturing for approval. While the inherent risks of biotech are undeniable, the deep dive into aTyr's time-series narrative provides a rare level of insight into a company's internal conviction, making this a truly compelling opportunity for investors who are willing to look beyond the headlines and read between the lines.

1ljcnva,https://i.redd.it/w6m9qj9cxv8f1.jpeg,Family business,"The story began almost a year ago, sometime in scorching August 2024, too hot to let the kids play outside during the day. So, I let them go to the local stationery shop to stock up on ways to keep busy during the hottest hours. That‚Äôs how the Qiyi in the middle, the one with the worn-out colors (next to my very first cube, which must date from the early 1980s because I am that old üò≠) came into our lives - that was the pick of my eldest son, age 13. He tried to figure it out, started searching the internet, and by September he was Sub-30. Then new budget cubes joined the collection before he raced past Sub-20 and dove into the world of more expensive gear‚Äîhere came the Weilong V9, the Gan 356, plus a 4x4 and a Megaminx. When I went with him to his first competition in March, I realized this was the nightmare of every parent: waiting around for 10 hours. On hard chairs. No coffee available. No escape. To survive the boredom, I started cubing myself. To my surprise, I liked it way more than I expected. Actually, it was a real revelation, and I soon started buying my own cubes, first a Dayan, then the Hudong and the Tornado V4 which is my actual main. I am ashamed to say that after 3-4 months of cubing, I‚Äôm still painfully just Sub-1 minute (my pb is 54 üòë), but in my defense, I have a busy life, lot of kids, two jobs, and a 45-year-old brain that just doesn‚Äôt brain like it used to (I‚Äôm stuck at 2-look OLL and have given up all hope for PLL). Not to mention the arthritis in my fingers. Yes, I know, lots of excuses! But I‚Äôm motivated‚Äîone day, I‚Äôll be Sub-30! I won‚Äôt go any further, but I‚Äôll do it! Meanwhile, my son is just a hair away from Sub-10 (10.8 the other day‚Äîwe‚Äôre almost there!), and big sis has joined in too (the ESC is hers), and now the lil bro too (he‚Äôs got the YJ Little Magic and the Weilong Pyraminx). So, with four cubers in the family, things are starting to get a bit out of control üòÇ; not all our cubes are even in the photo, there are 2 or 3 missing (and as many on order‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre waiting impatiently for the Weilong V11, it‚Äôs on its way, and there will be a battle for the unboxing). Strangely enough, none of us like GAN. We briefly had a 13, which we sold right away since everyone just hated it; we tried the 14 (which we found even worse) and the 15 (which we found OK, but with much better cubes available for less money). No, I will not mention the banana (none of us have mastered the 2x3, it seems), and as for the orange of shame, I think it will stay scrambled for eternity. I really appreciate how chill and welcoming the cubing community is- I‚Äôm already looking forward to our next family competition in September!",5,1750775514.0,Cubers,0,0.86,False

1ljcmvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ljcmvq/how_do_i_deal_with_im_not_ready_for_a_serious/,"How do I deal with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for a serious relationship‚Äù ? M21, F20","Hi, I am a 21M who recently got told by a girl I very much like that she is not ready for a serious relationship me.

Before I ask for specific advice, I‚Äôll give some background context:

I‚Äôve been working at a Beach Bar in England for over a year now, whilst finishing off the final year of university. Once the summer season starts to kick in, my bar hires more people to accommodate the massive influx of customers coming in, in the summer. Only myself and a few of the co workers lasted through the winter months, so when the mass hire came around, around 10-15 people where hired. 

One of which was a 20F who was a housemate of an existing co worker, who I met on her trial shift. I‚Äôm quite a reserved person when it comes to meeting new people, only getting more talkative once I speak to them more and more over a period of time. So when I saw her, I thought she was cute but really didn‚Äôt think much of it. A couple weeks go by and I don‚Äôt really think much of anything to do with her, moving with my life. 
Then one quiet shift came where it was just us two working on the same bar, I introduced myself properly this time and got to her know slightly. Turns out we had similar interests and 4hrs went by very quick. We spent a lot of time talking about movies, so I used this as a way to flirty get her instagram ‚Äúcan I grab your instagram, so i can send you my terrible movie recommendations‚Äù etc. She agreed and gave me hers. 

Usually when I get a girl‚Äôs instagram, it takes a lot of build up of pressure in my head and anxiety, but this time I felt very calm in her presence. As I was walking home she dm‚Äôed continuing our previous conversation.

I work nights on the weekend, so I‚Äôd see her more and more. Even if we weren‚Äôt working the same bar (at my bar, there are multiple bars that vary in size) we still managed to exchange words or flirt from across the venue etc. I notice more and more that she starts to lead the flirting as well, so it wasn‚Äôt just one-sided with me. Sounds cringey but, helping restock the bar, help me clean up outside when no one else wanted to. There were a few times when we in the stock room where we were speaking and making eye contact and I was thinking we were gonna kiss (we didn‚Äôt). 

I start to think more about her as her personality began to shine as I got to know her more and more. So weirdly again, I didn‚Äôt feel much pressure when I asked her out for a coffee date, it felt very natural which was a new experience for me. She accepted and we met a few days later.

We had a lovely time sitting on a rooftop cafe talking about each others lives, going further in depth conversation than I have before with a first date. Truth be told I was excited to see things in the near future. I felt very attracted to her, physically but also emotionally as well because she seems very emotionally mature. Which is rare on some of my previous dates. We meet at work later on the same shift and everything was as it was before. I walk her home after our shift and we hold hands and everything felt right. We kissed for the first time and we both made jokes that both felt so right. 

Moving on to our second date (sorry for rambling) the tension feels a little bit uneasy, I don‚Äôt how to specifically describe it. I asked her mutual friend who I worked with previously about some ideas and he approved, going the extra mile to make sure it was great for her. We got coffee, walked around the city and timed it perfectly so when it was nearing golden hour we sat at park with the perfect view. This time we speak deeper about each others childhood, family, friends etc and it was very sweet. Then seemingly out of nowhere she brings up the fact that she isn‚Äôt looking for a serious relationship. In the moment, I felt like I snapped back to reality. But I didn‚Äôt necessarily hurt. I built up trust with this person that i could ask her more of her side of the story. I did say that I was looking for something more serious, as I‚Äôm not really interested in casual dating, but I left it quite open-ended. In the way that connotes: let‚Äôs take it slow and see where it goes.

She explains about her previous boyfriend on how he was verbally abusive for half of their relationship and emotionally immature. And with this explanation, I understand why she said this. 

But what baffles me is everything after this conversation, because our date didn‚Äôt end her. We were still with each other for at least 3 hours after this difficult conversation, still being emotionally and physically intimate. 

Then the day after our date, I notice her texts begin to slow down. And my anxious thoughts begin to build due to my regret of not being honesty with the ideas that would want out of our situation. Each day passes and we she speaks less and then less. Then after a busy day of house viewing, I finally bring up her being distant. And she reinforces that she really isn‚Äôt looking for a serious relationship. 

I gave her the option of us slowing down and see where it goes or for us to stop. And she chose to stop. What frustrates me is the connection we had, in such a relatively short period of time, we had such a genuine strong connection. And now she closed it off, I still have to see her at work. 

I worked a late night shift with her a few days ago and we spoke briefly about it, and she seems very friendly about keeping me in her life but I don‚Äôt know how I feel. She still flirts and plays games with me at work and it really fucks with my head. 

I honestly don‚Äôt how I feel about her because I would love to keep texting and talking to her, but I don‚Äôt want to trip myself up with a person who‚Äôs values don‚Äôt align with mine, I but yearn for our connection and worry I won‚Äôt ever get it again.

I was just want to put this post out there to see if anyone can resonate with their own life experiences and has some advice for me. Either if that is talk to her again and see how she feels or takes to cut ties, I‚Äôm very open for other people‚Äôs interpretation.

I wanted to buy some kanna but I had never tried it before and I asked around and got a maybe a half a gram in a little black bottle with a spoon. I am not sure where it is from or the concentrations, but hey a gift is a gift (I know, I know, safety first don't snort things that strangers give you). 

Anyways, the first time I tried it I used the spoon in the little black vial and insufflated one spoonfull. I was traveling so I wasn't in my usual surroundings/ activities. 

After a couple minutes I began to feel a little woozy, yawning and feeling some light nausea but nothing too bad. This slightly unconfortable feeling lasted for 5-10 minutes tops and it was very manageable. I felt what I would call sleepy but motivated. It was a bit weird. I would compare it to taking a slightly larger microdose of mushrooms- not large enough to start tripping but a slightly bigger dose which in my experice leads to a bit of body discomfort and sleepiness. At this point I went for  a walk and the discomfort wore off and I enjoyed my walk in a slighly euphoric mood (again I would compare to a microdose). Nothing too clear or crazy but I was feeling good altough it was hard to judge.

The next day I tried again and I felt no initial discomfort or nausea but I did feel the sleepiness and yawning. and then a smooth uplifted mood. 

I took a little break for a couple of days and then I tried again, this time at home in my normal routine. I insufflated a little spoonfull again, before lunch and once again had slight nausea and discomfort, sleepiness and yawning. I also had a slight headache and my sinuses hurt on the side I insufflated. I went out to the garden and waitied a few minutes for this to pass. Once it did after about 5 to 10 minutes, I do feel energized, uplifted, lighty euphoric and have confirmed that this is a nice substance ( I was unsure if it was for me until now). The only other side effects are an increased heart rate (something to watchout for if thinking about mixing this with others subs- might get uncomfortable even with large amouts of caffine- I did drink one cup of coffee before this). 

In terms of usefulness- I was looking for something to help me with low moods and lack of motivation or help me feel focused and alert. I was also curious how this would work as  something more recreational as an alchohol substitute. I do think it might be underwhleming as an alch. substitute but it might work especially if mixing with very low doses of alch or weed but I would have to check back in for that after testing. The initial discomfort is a bummer but manageble and I have been reading that maybe I just need to find the right dose. I also want to play around with ROA becasue I don't like snorting this stuff. Maybe nasal spray or sublingual would be what I would try next. As a little help for low mood and motivation, I can definitely see potential and am looking forward to testing out over a onger period of time. 

Still a few things to work out but overall I am thinking about buying some more and keeping it in my toolbox. Also, I know this substance is compared to MDMA, but I would not compare it at all, not even in the same neighborhood. I would compare it to microdose of mushrooms mixed with a strong coffee. 

Best kanna wishes to all

I think I might be making a huge mistake by pursuing a relationship with a woman with BPD?

I‚Äôm a man with trauma related diagnosis along with disorganized attachment, some BPD/NPD (but not even close to enough to be diagnosed with either) traits and probably love addiction. 

I met a woman in 2021 who I had a really intense platonic friendship with but lost contact with. At the start of the year we ran into each other in the most unlikely of circumstance. 

It started out feeling platonic but quickly started to feel like she was trying to seduce me and I developed some limerence about her. Over coffee I told her that I had a crush on her but regardless of this I didn‚Äôt believe either of us were in a space where we could be together.

She told me that she also had a crush on me and that it was a relief that we weren‚Äôt going to take it any further as she was ‚Äúa runner‚Äù and ‚Äúdestroyed people in relationships‚Äù.

So with the air cleared we just went ahead and became quite enmeshed emotionally. I‚Äôm thinking of just going ahead and trying to take the relationship with her to the next level. I guess I‚Äôm worried about the ethics of it for a couple of reasons some being 1) that she kind of let me know she wanted to have some boundaries on a romantic relationship 2) I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm too jealous/insecure to be in a relationship with a woman who is so vivacious/flirty 3) I have a history of making it work for way longer than it works with woman with cluster b disorders.

Any feedback?

I kind of feel that we have been able to maintain a really authentic relationship over the past 5 months‚Ä¶

Part of me feels like I love her and we can be each other‚Äôs person. Maybe us being reunited was the universe telling us to be together? Maybe it was just a coincidence and nothing means anything?",1,1750774990.0,BPDPartners,9,0.6,False

1ljce72,https://www.reddit.com/r/Steeev/comments/1ljce72/understanding_the_dunbar_number_the_science_of/,Understanding the Dunbar Number: The Science of Friendship and Why It Matters,"How many friends can a person realistically have? Not just social media ""connections"" or LinkedIn ""contacts,"" but actual, real-world friends‚Äîpeople you can call at 2am when life gets messy. According to British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, the magic number is 150.

This concept, known as the ""Dunbar Number,"" has become a cultural touchstone in discussions about friendship, community, and human connection. But what does it actually mean for our modern lives? And, more importantly, why does it matter?

**What Is the Dunbar Number?**

In the early 1990s, Robin Dunbar proposed that humans have a cognitive limit on the number of meaningful social relationships they can maintain. His research, which drew on primate studies, suggested that humans can only manage about 150 ""stable relationships"" at any given time. This isn‚Äôt just acquaintances‚Äîit‚Äôs people you genuinely know and recognise.

But it‚Äôs more layered than that. The 150 figure is part of a wider hierarchy of social circles:

* **5 Close Friends**: Your inner circle‚Äîthe people you‚Äôd call first in a crisis.
* **15 Good Friends**: People you regularly see and speak to. They‚Äôre your dinner party crowd.
* **50 Friends**: The wider friendship group‚Äîpeople you‚Äôd invite to a big birthday party.
* **150 Meaningful Relationships**: These are the people whose lives you‚Äôre aware of and can recall details about.

Beyond 150, it becomes difficult to maintain meaningful connections. After that, we‚Äôre in ""acquaintance"" territory, which might explain why having 500 Facebook friends doesn‚Äôt necessarily make you feel connected.

**Why 150?**

Dunbar‚Äôs theory links the size of the neocortex (the part of the brain responsible for conscious thought, language, and social interaction) to group size. In early human societies, being able to recognise faces, maintain alliances, and remember who‚Äôs trustworthy was crucial for survival. In essence, we‚Äôre ""hardwired"" to maintain a social circle of about 150 people.

Interestingly, evidence for this number shows up in surprising places. From ancient hunter-gatherer societies to modern-day military units, 150 consistently appears as a group size that fosters stability. In fact, many military companies are still structured around this number, and the average size of small-town communities in history often hovered around 150.

**Friendship in the Modern World**

While Dunbar‚Äôs theory is rooted in evolutionary anthropology, its relevance has only grown in the digital age. On platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, it‚Äôs easy to ""connect"" with thousands of people. But how many of those connections are truly meaningful?

Research suggests that while people may have 300, 500, or even 1,000 Facebook friends, the number of ""true"" friends remains stubbornly close to Dunbar‚Äôs 150. Psychologists argue that too much focus on shallow online connections can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, even as we appear more ""connected"" than ever.

The COVID-19 pandemic put this theory to the test. Lockdowns and social distancing forced people to reflect on who their closest friends really were. When you‚Äôre restricted to meeting a handful of people, suddenly those ""500 friends"" on Facebook don‚Äôt seem so relevant.

**The Importance of Friendship for Men**

Friendship is essential for mental health, but it‚Äôs especially critical for men. Research shows that men often have fewer close friendships than women, and they‚Äôre less likely to talk openly about their emotions. Platforms like [*Steeev.com*](http://Steeev.com), which aim to help men form friendships, are trying to address this issue by fostering spaces for men to connect.

The Dunbar Number reminds us that, while it‚Äôs fine to have a wide social network, it‚Äôs the smaller circles that matter most. It‚Äôs your five closest friends, your ""fifteen"" go-to people, and your wider circle of 50-150 that provide emotional support, community, and a sense of belonging.

**How to Use the Dunbar Number to Improve Your Life**

If you‚Äôve ever felt overwhelmed by social obligations, Dunbar‚Äôs theory can offer clarity. Instead of chasing thousands of connections, focus on deepening your inner circles. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Nurture Your Inner Circle**: Make a list of your ""5 closest friends"" and think about how often you‚Äôre checking in with them. Send a message, schedule a coffee, or call them just to catch up.
2. **Strengthen Your 15**: These people are your ""regulars""‚Äîgood friends you see every month or so. Make plans with them that are intentional and meaningful. Don‚Äôt just wait for the next birthday party.
3. **Simplify Your Social Media**: It‚Äôs tempting to ""collect"" friends online, but having 1,000 Instagram followers isn‚Äôt the same as having a group of people who truly know you. Unfollow or mute accounts that aren‚Äôt adding value to your life.
4. **Embrace Small Gatherings**: Instead of big parties, host smaller, more intimate gatherings where everyone can have a proper conversation. Think ""dinner party"" rather than ""festival afterparty.""
5. **Invest in New Friendships**: Meeting new people is crucial, especially as adults. Platforms like [*Steeev.com*](http://Steeev.com) offer men the chance to make new connections in ways that feel natural, not forced.

**Can You Beat the Dunbar Number?**

Some people argue that, with modern technology, we can expand our friendship capacity beyond 150. Digital calendars, group chats, and ""friendship tracking apps"" can help us stay in touch. But does technology really allow us to expand our capacity for deep connection, or does it just give us more acquaintances?

Dunbar himself is skeptical. While we can use technology to ""track"" more people, our ability to *care* about them is still limited. As he put it, ""Your brain doesn‚Äôt get bigger just because you have WhatsApp.""

**The Final Word**

The Dunbar Number is more than a curiosity of anthropology‚Äîit‚Äôs a reminder that quality trumps quantity. It‚Äôs not about knowing *more* people, it‚Äôs about knowing the *right* people. In a world that‚Äôs constantly telling us to ""network"" and ""build connections,"" Dunbar‚Äôs insight feels refreshingly old-fashioned.

So, take a moment to think about your 150. Who‚Äôs in your five? Who‚Äôs in your fifteen? And, most importantly, who do you need to call today to remind them that, in your crowded world, they matter most.

LONG READ BUT I AM GOING CRAZY,"So I (27f) have been working at a really high end cafe and catering business for the past nine months. This cafe is on an island (connected to the mainland by bridge) , and we get really really busy during the summer months‚Ä¶ meaning we hire a bunch of people before the season kicks off, and often times these people are over here on a visa. There aren‚Äôt a lot of workers that are actually from the island, and already have housing.
Due to this,  the managers also provide housing for the employees that need it. There is no signed lease, no paperwork.. I literally just Venmo my landlord the monthly rent that we only verbally agreed upon. 

I had been living in one of their properties for the past eight months. They assured me over and over that I wouldn‚Äôt be asked to move and I could get comfortable. So I did. Suddenly they hire three girls from Europe whom are all friends, therefore they all want to live together. BAM - I was asked to move from the place I called home for the past eight months to make these girls comfortable..  

Now I was fine with the situation at first because again they assured me that I would be moved to a comfortable nice house and everything would be okay. That I was a priority because I‚Äôve been doing hard work for them for longer than these new people coming on. Originally they told me I would be living with a single man‚Ä¶ okay, kinda off-putting, but  then this man did not work out, so they told me I was going to be living with a group of THREE men from overseas‚Ä¶ I am a traveler and I have been in some weird living situations before so I wasn‚Äôt too fussed, but I did say I would rather not be in that situation.. Finally they decided that they were going to put me in the house with a married couple (same age as me)

Now I was already starting to get uncomfortable with the fact that they felt as though they could move me around whenever and wherever they wanted. I felt pretty unsettled for a while and when I found out I was going to be moving in with a young married couple as a single woman, I told them I was pretty uncomfortable with the situation and begged multiple times for them to figure something out.  They didn‚Äôt offer any solution, and I thought maybe I was overreacting or assuming the worst, so I decided to just give it a shot‚Ä¶ mind you this couple has been working for the business for two months, whereas I had been there for nearly a year. My role was very important and you needed to have high performing abilities (I was making over 200 coffees by myself daily. Roughly one coffee per minute every minute the cafe was open. If you know anything about coffee I was using a la marzocco) whereas the husband and wife are not so high performance (she‚Äôs a food runner, he‚Äôs a dishy)
 
About a month before moving in to the new place I started seeing my current boyfriend. He‚Äôd come over every night (driving 1.5 hours to me and back to his place every day) just to see me and spend time with me.  It was never a problem before, because I lived alone and I am a fucking adult woman?

He helped me move all of my things into the new place, and I introduced him multiple times to my new housemates. Now my man is a giant teddy bear, he made such an effort to be nice to them. He continued doing the daily 3 hour drive to come see me. We are both really laid back and spiritual people. We clean up after ourselves, we are quiet and respectful of others spaces‚Ä¶ However the married couple is extremely religious. 

one day at work I get a text message from the wife, asking when my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù was going to leave because ‚Äúshe feels uncomfortable with him being there without me there‚Äù I responded  saying we are ALL adults, and that I pay rent so I cant have my boyfriend over whenever the hell I want to. (In a more respectful way of course). Dont get me wrong, I have a lot of trauma due to SA in my past so I can understand how a young woman might be uncomfortable alone in the house with a man‚Ä¶ but at this point they knew each other. My boyfriend literally never left my bedroom and ALL of the doors had locks, and my boyfriend did not have access to keys to any of the doors. On top of that, he was probably there alone with here for a total of ONE HOUR. 

She dropped it for a while, and my boyfriend continued driving out every night. We did work on the house, unclogged the drains (bc the married couple enjoyed showering in their nasty filth water as they allowed the shower drain to remain clogged) we cleaned up the lawn, never left a mess, didn‚Äôt make any sounds‚Ä¶.

I thought everything was fine until the landlord came over one night. I was having a good conversation, introduced my boyfriend and everything was okay. 

Suddenly the couple comes out of their room and start lying, saying that my boyfriend is there all the time when im not there , that he‚Äôs been living with me and that he makes them super uncomfortable.  I was really confused because we literally did nothing wrong, my boyfriend actually has his own house and he‚Äôs been driving to see me every night partially because his work sites were closer to me (he‚Äôs a roofer and carpenter) , but he‚Äôs always gone by 7am, and he doesn‚Äôt get there until 7:30pm‚Ä¶ a few times on the weekend he slept in until like 8am, then drove to have breakfast at my place of work‚Ä¶ the wife starts making us out to be horrible people and the husband keeps on saying his wife deserves to be comfortable in her own house. That only employees should be allowed in the staff housing etc‚Ä¶.. BAM , my landlord tells me my boyfriend is no longer allowed over. 

The married couple start thanking him, and he leaves. As soon as he‚Äôs out the door, they start laughing and cheering. I start sobbing. I feel so betrayed and taken advantage of, and it seemed like they didn‚Äôt care about me or my life at all.

As a grown ass woman who has been paying rent and living alone for years, why can I suddenly not have an adult relationship? Why am I not allowed to have my boyfriend over yet I am being forced to live with a married couple?

I quit that night and a few days later moved in with my boyfriend‚Ä¶ 

Now im slightly stressed out because I lost my house, my job and all the people I thought cared about me in one day.
