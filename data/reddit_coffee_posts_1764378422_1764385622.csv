I just got back from the Winnipeg Christmas Market at the RBC convention centre. While for the most part it was a great experience there was one vendor that I was sus about, AI art, but I couldn't be too sure.

Overall, it's a great opportunity to check out some incredible local businesses, I was genuinely surprised at the amount of unique local businesses for me to explore after the show, I was pleasantly surprised.

I picked up coffee beans, and found a new local roaster that I'm excited about.

If you went, I'd love to know what you think!",1,1764385526.0,Winnipeg,0,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball spectacle where Loyola Marymount’s defense is about to play *Whack-a-Mole* with Stony Brook’s hopes, and the Seawolves’ three-pointers will either be a tidal wave or a puddle of regret. Let’s dive into the numbers, news, and nonsense.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Your Grandma Could Predict This

Loyola Marymount (-9.5 to -11.0) is being handed odds that make a Tesla look like a horse and buggy. At decimal prices of 1.15–1.24, the implied probability of an LMU win ranges from **83% to 89%**—which is about the same chance of me *not* making a dad joke in this analysis (spoiler: I failed). Stony Brook’s longshots (5.3–5.75) imply a **17%–20%** chance, which is roughly the odds your local coffee shop runs out of decaf on a Monday.

The spread? A brutal -9.5 to -11.0 for LMU, meaning bookmakers think this game will be less of a contest and more of a *math quiz*. If you bet Stony Brook, you’re essentially saying, “I trust these guys to shoot 9.6 threes *and* outrun Loyola’s defense, which allows 17.8 points fewer per game than Stony Brook’s meager 9.2 edge.” Good luck with that.

---

### Statistical Shenanigans: Defense Wins Championships (and This Game)

Loyola Marymount’s defense is tighter than a nun’s budget during tax season. They’re allowing a measly **64.6 points per game**, holding opponents to **38% shooting**—a number so low, it makes Stony Brook’s allowed **41%** look like a free-throw contest. Meanwhile, LMU’s offense is a well-oiled machine, shooting **49.6% from the field** (8.6% better than Stony Brook’s defense can handle).

Stony Brook’s pride? Their three-pointers. They’re nailing **9.6 per game**, which is **2.6 more** than LMU allows. But here’s the catch: LMU’s defense is so good, they’d make Steph Curry question his life choices. The Lions are third in the West Coast Conference in scoring defense, while Stony Brook is second in the CAA in *allowing* points. Translation: The Seawolves’ “strength” is about to be

1p9dywo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1p9dywo/should_i_ghost_my_workplace_and_screw_over_my/,Should I ghost my workplace and screw over my coworkers and boss or honor the fact that I said I would leave in one week?,"I work at a coffee shop, there's two that I switch between. The total staff is about 10 between the two stores. I do the closing shift 1-10, 1-6, 12:30-8 depending on the day and store. 

I dont want to get into the entire lore but to make it brief: the closer is expected to leave on time. The owner does not pay you if you stay pass the closing shift time. They expect you to be able to get everything done within the time frame. 

I've been working here almost 2 years. Some days I would get out on time. Other days I would be there 20-40 minutes after. 

Me and the owner got into an argument because they told me I was doing too many closing things early. We went back and forth and I told them that this was unreasonable and I was doing too much unpaid labor and me doing things early was me trying to do get out on time. Eventually I told him that I would call him and decide if I wanted to continue this job or not ( we said a lot more to eachother but I am shortening). 

I called and left a message and told him next week would be my last week. He has not called me back. I went into the store to check the schedule and I am already scheduled. I also have shifts this weekend ( Sat+ Sunday). 

I'm debating if I should just ghost. I wrote down pros and cons 

Pros: 

Winter has officially started. Its snowing outside and its cold. I dont want to be there until 10 pm and I can be in my bed 

I dont need to use this store as a reference. I have savings to last me about 2 months and will be going back to uni in Jan and will have my student loans. Money will be tight and I will have to look for another job but I will be okay for a while. 

I did so much unpaid labor for this store cause I was desperate for a job and couldn't just quit, it honestly made me bitter. 

I dont have to deal with the awkward week before leaving. I wish the owner would have just called me back, I called him yesterday at 1pm and I'm being petty but I find it rude. 

Cons: 

- if I do a no show then it will fall on my coworkers to pick up the slack. One of them will have to stay to cover my shifts. 

- its the holiday season, people have booked days off and I'm bringing additional stress 

- I probably wont come and pick up my last cheque. It'll be too awkward. 

- leaving on bad terms will never see these ppl again but they might call the police. The address they have isn't even correct on file cause I never updated it. One coworker does know I might be ghosting because I told her so she might say something. ",1,1764385424.0,antiwork,0,1.0,False

Despite being vegan for several years now, I find it hard to incorporate fruits and vegetables in my diet so smoothies are my best bet - however, I don’t own a blender and the last time I did, it was impossible to clean.

So, I’m looking for any store bought brands that sell bottled smoothies, preferably with recyclable bottles and that do not contain banana.

Literally every smoothie I’ve seen in Tesco contains banana and I’m devastated by it because the only way to get a smoothie without banana right now is to pay extortionate prices at coffee shops.

If there’s nothing I’ll also take recommendations for blenders that are INSANELY EASY to clean because I don’t have a lot of energy and doing the dishes already is a nightmare.",1,1764385383.0,veganuk,0,1.0,False

I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I’m 27 and the youngest manager at my company that I started at 3 months ago. one of the girl in my crew is 23 and everything started professionally. I never saw her in that way and didn’t even try because I read all the stories here of dating coworkers . One day we had to ride together and found out we both like the same things and grew up in the same area before moving to other cities. 

We started off texting through the company phones then switched to personal. Before that she has already shown interest in me by flirting. Now we’ll get coffee and some times lunch together but outside of work we have never hung out even though I have asked but she always says she’s busy. On her way home we’ll talk through the phone and before work. Then some times before she goes to bed and we’ll text no stop. 

She has never asked me to do anything for her from my role and I have never helped her in anyway or given her preference. The other day she asked me how I felt about her and I told her I thought she was cool and wanted to see where things go, her reply was “no comment” with laughing faces, I was like wait what the hell. The day before I saw her looking at me from across the office and I asked her later that day why and she said she was dogging me for talking to the delivery girl but she said she was joking? 

I have analyzed the whole thing and I feel I fucked up. I feel now she was just using me for attention at work, and I feel stupid. at this point I don’t know how to end this and I should’ve been more professional cause of my role. I haven’t had a good night sleep in two days just thinking of how to end this, because the past couple days I’ve tried ignoring her she always calls me or texts me why I’m mad or what’s wrong. 

I’m not sure if I should ask her what she really wants and if she’s serious I can transfer to our other branches down the road or she can. Or just try to ghost her as much as possible. ",1,1764385328.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Happy Thanksgiving weekend 

Looking for a good conversation, I’m based in Canada and open to chatting with people from NA. Starting with a casual convo and  friends -  open to something more if that transpires. 

Here is a bit about me: I like travelling, reading, painting, binging shows, music and baking from time to time. In terms of personality, I’m easy going, a curious person by nature, grounded, can hold a conversation. I like cats. Fireworks. Brownies. A hot cup of coffee on a cold morning. Board games. I read a lot of non-fiction but lately have been thinking I should delve into some fiction. 

I would like to meet someone respectful, kind, good communication, consistent, good career, articulate, age-appropriate 34/35+, funny, cute, good banter skills and single. I’ve been in situationships and not trying to get into another one so someone emotionally available would be great. 

Would prefer someone from North America. I’m in Canada EST in case you need a time zone. 

If you feel like we may mesh, please send a message with a bit about yourself :) ",1,1764385252.0,r4r,1,1.0,True

I figured I’d put everything here and hope some of you can steer me in the right direction. I’m very much learning as I go, so feel free to point things out if I’m doing something completely backwards.

1) Timemore C3s ESP Pro:what grind setting works for AeroPress?

My mom brought me a Timemore C3s ESP Pro from the States. Great gift, but of course it wasn’t the exact model I asked for (asked for a C3s). Anyway, I can’t figure out the grind range for AeroPress on this thing. There’s barely anything online about this specific grinder. If anyone owns it or knows the click range that roughly corresponds to medium-fine, please help me out.


2) My brother sent some coffee beans but I’m not sure how they’re “supposed” to taste

He sent me:
	Guatemala Antigua
	French Vanilla (flavoured)

I can taste a huge difference compared to instant, but I don’t know if I’m actually brewing them well or just randomly getting lucky. If it helps, I don’t mind posting a video of my routine.Recently i played with the grind settings and found out in two different settings that the coffee tasted sour and bitter respectively 

Also, I’m thinking of asking him to send more beans from Central Market Organics or other brand roasters. If anyone knows good ones from there, I’m open to suggestions.


3) How do you experiment with an AeroPress without drinking a ridiculous amount of coffee?

My usual brew is:
	18g coffee
	200 ml water
      85–90°C
	Bloom: around 30 sec
	Steep: around 45–60 sec

I want to experiment more, but I don’t know how people test different recipes without ending up….overcaffeinated and vibrating. How do you pace it or structure it so you can compare brews properly?


4) If I want to add milk… do I add it to the whole brew or only part of it?

Like if I want something milk based, am I supposed to:
	Brew normally and add milk to all 200 ml?
	Brew something stronger and only mix part of it with milk?

And if anyone has tips on making AeroPress versions of lattes/flat whites/etc., I’d appreciate it…..I’m basically clueless there.


5) Is it normal for the grinder to feel like it gets “stuck” on finer settings?

When I grind finer, the handle sometimes catches or feels like it’s stuck for a second. Is this normal for hand grinders, or should I worry?


Thanks in advance to anyone who replies! I’m just trying to learn without wasting beans or driving myself insane, so any advice helps.

I’m the founder of a new local project called **Popera**, and I wanted to share it here because Reddit has always been the place where real people tell you the truth, good or bad.

Popera is basically my attempt to solve something I’ve seen again and again:  
**people want to gather in real life, but the tools to actually** ***make it happen*** **always feel way too big, too formal, or too disconnected.**

We built Popera to make it *stupidly simple* for anyone, creators, friends, small sellers, local organizers and even regular people to host **micro pop-ups** anywhere: cafés, parks, living rooms, studios, anywhere that feels human. And every pop-up gets its own **group chat**, so people can talk, warm up, and connect *before* they ever show up.

Think of it as:  
**“Bring your crowd anywhere.”**  
Whether that crowd is 3 people or 300.

We just released our early version and it’s live, it works but now we need honest early users to poke at it, try hosting something small, and tell us what sucks, what feels good, and what’s missing.

Here’s the link if you want to try it: [**https://gopopera.ca**](https://gopopera.ca?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

You can:

* Create a free pop-up
* Join any event
* Chat with the group
* Favorite things
* Host something tiny (a coffee meetup, a mini-market, a board game night… anything)
* And give me real feedback so I can fix what needs fixing

I’m not here to sell anything, I’m here because I genuinely want Popera to become something shaped by the people who actually use it, not by my assumptions.

  
If you try it and have **any** feedback (bugs, ideas, missing features, confusing UX, whatever) you can comment here or DM us. We're building this day by day, and your input literally changes the product.

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance if you help out.

Not by accident. Not by mistake. On purpose.   
Lazzaro Rosetti is everything I hate—arrogant, cruel, and way too hot for his own good.   
He married my mom in a cold, arranged marriage。  
And from day one, he's made it his mission to torment me.   
He corners me in hallways. Smirks when I stutter.   
Grabs my ankle and won't let go just to watch me squirm.   
But tonight, he crossed a line I didn't even know existed.   
He slipped into my bed in the dead of night, pulled me against his arm, and whispered in my ear like the devil himself.   
""Ride my fingers.""   
I should have screamed. I should have run.   
Instead, I came. Three times.   
And when I woke up the next morning, there was a heart drawn in his cum on my sheets—  
A filthy little love note only I would understand.   
Now I'm trapped in a house with a man who hates my family, craves my body.  
And won't stop until he owns every last piece of me.   
The worst part? I think I want him to.  
  
My eyes snap open, and a scream rises up my throat.   
  
Every muscle in my body goes rigid, and terror claws at my heart. Please let this be a dream. A nightmare.  
  
Directly in front of me is the floor-to-ceiling mirror on the front of my wardrobe, and I stare into my own wide-eyed, terror-stricken reflection. My cheek is pressed into the pillow, and the white ruffled strap of my pajama top has slipped down. A shaft of silver moonlight falls across my comforter, and the clock on my bedside table ticks out every agonizing second. It's nearly one in the morning. The witching hour?  
  
More like the devil's hour.  
  
And the devil's in my bed.  
  
A large, muscular figure is cloaked in darkness. He shifts with a sleepy murmur, and the sheer size of him rocks my whole body. His head is behind mine on the pillow, and I can see little of him except for the dark, silky hair falling across his forehead and the sleeve of his black T-shirt stretched tight around his muscular bicep.  
  
This man is huge. Tall and built like a linebacker. The first time I laid eyes on him, I thought he was uncomfortably, aggressively large, and I still think that every time he walks into a room. I feel like I'm sharing this usually generous bed with a nine-foot demon from HELL. His body heat is scorching the backs of my bare legs, and my normally sweet-smelling bedroom is filled with an invasive masculine scent.  
  
I hate this man in the daylight, and I fear him at night. I can't stand him looking at me or even breathing near me, and I absolutely loathe the sensation of his body brushing against mine. Every second of every day, I'm trying to avoid his massive body in the kitchen or ignore the way he glares at me across the dining table. The last place he should be is in my bed. We're not lovers.  
  
We're not even friends.  
  
Lazzaro Rosetti is Mom's twenty-nine-year-old husband, a grade-A asshole, and my new stepfather.  
  
I angle my chin up and sniff the air, trying to catch the scent of alcohol, which might explain why Lazzaro has mistaken my bedroom for the one he shares with Mom, but there's nothing but the aroma of his cologne. I say ""shares,"" but my new stepfather is unpredictable, coming in and out of the house at all hours of the day and night. He's more like a restless animal than a man. Sometimes I catch him sleeping on the sofa or on a deck chair out by the pool. One morning last week, he was sleeping on the living room floor, and I stepped over him on my way to the kitchen. Lazzaro came suddenly alive, grabbing my ankle and refusing to let go as I squealed and tried to shake him off. His grip was an iron manacle, and his green eyes flashed with malice. All the while, he was grinning like this was a game to him.  
  
I managed to kick him in the ribs with my sneaker, and he grunted in pain. Still grinning, he yanked me closer so he could take his revenge by looking up my skirt.  
  
Lazzaro gazed up at me from the floor. ""Mm, white lace. My favorite.""  
  
Cheeks blazing with humiliation, I shoved my skirt between my legs. ""You asshole.""  
  
Mom's footsteps could be heard coming down the sweeping marble stairs, and Lazzaro let go of me so fast that I stumbled. By the time she came into the kitchen with a crimson-and-gold silk robe hanging from her elegant shoulders, he was leaning against the kitchen counter, waiting for the coffee machine to finish dispensing a double shot of Colombian roast.  
  
I found my voice a few seconds later. ""Mom, Lazzaro just grabbed me, and he wouldn't let go.""  
  
Lazzaro passed the coffee to Mom, no cream or sugar, just how she likes it. She stared in confusion at his out-of-character thoughtful gesture but then accepted the cup.  
  
""Mia stumbled and I didn't want her to fall and hurt herself,"" he explained mildly.  
  
""That's not what—""  
  
Mom winced and pinched her brow. ""Mia, please keep your voice down. I just woke up. And next time, look where you're going.""  
  
Lazzaro folded his arms and smirked at me behind his wife's back.  
  
Mom pushed out through the double doors to drink her coffee in the garden. She didn't look at me once. Mom almost never looks at me.  
  
After all these years, you'd think I'd be used to it, but it still hurts being the Bianchi family's shame. Mom's face falls or her eyes skim over me whenever I walk into a room. Grandmother flinches whenever I speak at the dinner table. My three uncles give me stony glares before kissing my older sisters hello warmly.  
  
A vicious whisper sounded in my ear. ""So, it's true. No one believes a single word out of your mouth.""  
  
Lazzaro was standing right behind me. He was so close that I could see every detail of the scar that cuts vertically through his lips on the left-hand side. It gives him a dangerous, roguish appearance, especially when he smiles and bares his strong white teeth.  
  
His vindictive mouth whispered, ""Or maybe it's just that they don't care what you have to say, and never have.""  
  
Now he's in my bed, and I don't know if it's a mistake or on purpose. But I'm not sticking around to find out. I grasp the edge of the mattress and wriggle my way toward it, staring at our reflections in the mirror and hoping I don't wake him.  
  
Lazzaro's eyes pop open. I catch the feral gleam of his green gaze in the darkness, and my stomach swoops. A slow, nasty smile spreads over his face.  
  
He's not confused.  
  
He knows exactly whose bed he's in.  
  
I want to scream, but I don't, because eighteen years on this earth has taught me that no matter what goes wrong, it's always my fault.   
  
If Mom runs in here, Lazzaro will protest that he made an honest mistake.   
  
Mom will tell me I'm attention-seeking, and I'll end up being forced to apologize for causing drama in the middle of the night. I'd rather gargle hot sauce and toilet cleaner than say sorry to this man.  
  
""What are you doing in my room?"" I hiss, holding tight to the blankets.  
  
""Your mom's pissing me off.""  
  
When are they not pissing each other off? Every time they fight, I'm the one who pays for it. Mom walks around slamming doors and shouting. Lazzaro finds me and destroys whatever peace I've found watching TV, swimming in the pool, or reading in the garden.  
  
""Then go and sleep on the sofa.""  
  
""But I like your bed.""  
  
""Then I'll go sleep on the sofa.""  
  
But Lazzaro grabs the back of my pajama top as I try to get out of bed. ""Running off? So rude when I'm being nice to you.""  
  
""How is this nice?"" I exclaim in an outraged whisper.  
  
""Did anyone else talk to you today?""  
  
Tonight, Uncle Tomaso and Aunt Sofia came to dinner with their children, two cousins who are older than me and another who is younger. At one point, I asked one of my cousins how school was going. Aunt Sofia immediately talked over me and changed the subject.  
  
""Screw you,"" I whisper, shuddering with anger and humiliation.  
  
Lazzaro slides an arm beneath me and drags me back against his arms. ""Cold? I'll warm you up.""  
  
His searing hot flesh presses against my back, scorching me from the nape of my neck to my heels. I struggle to get out of his grip, but both of his arms come around me. One of his hands is on my waist and the other is on my bare inner thigh. He's wearing sweats, but as his hips press into me, I feel the telltale ridge of something hard and thick against my butt.  
  
Panicked words fall from my lips. ""What the... is that your... Oh, my God.""  
  
""What's what?"" Lazzaro speaks directly into my ear, his deep voice rumbly and tinged with lust and amusement. I dig my nails into his muscular forearms and grit my teeth against the restless, fluttering feeling low in my belly. He gets off on tormenting me, and he's made that clear from day one. The moment he crossed the threshold into this house after their honeymoon, his expression dark with anger and every muscle bunched beneath his black T-shirt, he zeroed in on me. Someone was going to suffer for what he'd been forced to do, and I'm his perfect victim.  
  
No, it started before that day. Our eyes met at the church altar and his gaze fell to my nip//ples, which were pebbled into points and painfully obvious through my pink satin bridesmaid gown. It was so cold in the church, they were practically visible from space.  
  
The priest prompted him to say his vows, and he lifted his eyes to mine as he spoke the words, I do.  
  
Like a curse.  
  
Like a threat.  
  
""Why are you torturing me like this? What did I ever do to you?""  
  
In our reflections, Lazzaro's eyes narrow with spite. ""It's nothing personal, Mia. I just hate your family.""  
  
He didn't want to marry Mom, and Mom didn't want to marry him, but it was arranged by our families like something out of the Middle Ages. The Rosetti family wants to force Lazzaro to settle down, and Mom wants some of the power and money that the Rosetti men wield like weapons in this city. Absolutely nothing about their marriage has to do with love. It's pure business.  
  
I lie still for a moment, letting Lazzaro think he's won whatever sick game he's playing. He reaches up and palms one of my bre//asts like he owns it. And pleasure courses through me.  
  
I ram my elbow into Lazzaro's stomach and fling myself off the bed.   
  
""Ah-ah, Mia,"" he taunts. ""Can't have you roaming the house in the middle of the night. Good girls stay in bed.""  
  
I growl with frustration as loud as I dare. ""I hate you,"" I seethe, wrenching myself back and forth in his iron-like grip.  
  
""I hate you more.""  
  
I buck in his arms until his hand lands on my intimacy and his fingers curl to cup my se//x over my pajama shorts. I inhale sharply. ""What are you doing?""  
  
""Ride my fingers.""  
  
""Go to HELL,"" I say through gritted teeth. My whole body is rigid as I wait for him to continue my humiliation. To grow bolder. To become an even worse man by invading my clothing. But Lazzaro doesn't move. Instead, he laughs softly, and I see in our reflection that he closes his eyes and relaxes.  
  
""Whatever. They're there if you need them.""  
  
And Lazzaro goes to sleep, leaving his fingers right where they are, tucked against my se//x. My heart pounds, and my heart feels like it's about to explode. I take as deep a breath as I can, locked in the cage of Lazzaro's arms. I'll wait until he's asleep and then get the hell out of here.  
  
My eyes focus on our reflection. I'm flat-che//sted and straight-waisted, and I have never felt sexy. But I look different in Lazzaro's big arms with his muscular forearm draped around my middle, and I feel a little bit precious with his sleep-softened face pressed into the side of my neck. He looks as rough and scary as always, but the way he's curled around me seems... protective. Possessive.  
  
Like I'm wanted for a change.  
  
My gaze sweeps down his body, from the hard planes of his face and jaw to his shoulder looming over mine.   
  
The bumps of his ribs beneath his T-shirt and the inch of warm, tanned skin where his top has ridden up his belly.   
  
Lazzaro always looks too big to be allowed, but right now his bigness seems just right. My heart pounds and my stomach is alive with fluttering. I shift slightly in his arms and feel the unmistakable sensation of wetness between my legs and against his fingers through my thin cotton shorts.  
  
And because I'm wet and slippery, the pressure of his fingers against my cl//it feels amazing. Lazzaro is the biggest asshole I've ever met, but he's also stupidly hot, and I hate him even more because of it. Every time he smirks at me, I can tell he's thinking how great he is.  
  
Barely realizing I'm doing it, I rotate my hips in slow circles. My eyes drift closed as the tiny movements cause a tidal wave of sensation to crash through me. I've masturbated plenty of times before, and the results have been swift but unsatisfying. Mechanically, everything works as it's supposed to, but something was always missing.  
  
Someone to fantasize about.  
  
My eyes snap open and fasten on Lazzaro's sleeping face. Mom's husband is not the object of my desires. That's just sick. But he is aggressively masculine and smells like sin, two things I crave, apparently, because my hips are still moving on their own. Back and forth on Lazzaro's fingers. I let out a soft pant as the sensations kick up a notch.  
  
I'll stop.  
  
I will.  
  
This is so screwed up and wrong.  
  
But so is he for coming in here.  
  
Lazzaro's arms are painfully tight around me, and his hard-on is wedged tight in my butt. The room is dark, and my core is so molten hot that reality starts to slide out of my grasp. There's just pleasure and a man's strong fingers against my intimacy, and the memory of his sultry voice breathing in my ear, Ride my fingers.  
  
I let out the tiniest of whimpers, but Lazzaro's breathing stays deep and even. He has no idea what's happening, and I'm close—so close—and I can't make myself stop. It's never felt this good before, and I have to discover what's waiting for me on the other side of this delicious feeling.  
  
Just a little more... just a little more... I want... I need...  
  
Heat and pleasure rise up and crash over me. My body flexes in Lazzaro's strong arms as I hurtle beyond all conscious thought and straight into pure pleasure.  
  
That was better than anything I've felt in my entire life.  
  
I drew in a deep breath and open my eyes.  
  
Lazzaro is awake and staring at me, his expression absolutely feral.  
  
Fear lashes through me, and I yelp, grabbing hold of his taut forearms and clinging to him, even though he's the one I'm afraid of.  
  
""I wasn't..."" I start to say in a high-pitched, panicked voice.  
  
With a growl, Lazzaro rolls on top of me. His bulk pins me face first to the mattress and his hot breath seethes in my ear. ""Again.""  
  
My eyes open wide. With his feet, he forces my legs open and thrusts his hips down, pushing my intimacy against his fingers.  
  
""What? No—""  
  
My intimacy rolls against his hand, and I moan as pure pleasure builds inside me again. He keeps rhythmically thrusting himself against my butt while he moves his fingers in a come here motion.  
  
""Stop that,"" I buzz angrily into the mattress. I try to buck him off, but he's too heavy, and I only succeed in working myself harder against his fingers. I can't possibly come again. Not so soon. Surely bodies aren't built that way, but to my horror, heat and pleasure are mounting within me. I feel him through layers of fabric like we're completely bare. His c0ck against my butt. His fingers on my intimacy. He's breathing hard in my ear like we really are screwing.  
  
""Come on, Mia. Show me how bad girls get off in the middle of the night.""  
  
""I'm going to kill... ahh."" To my shame, everything down there suddenly tightens up and bursts gloriously apart.  
  
""Again,"" he orders, before I can even draw breath back into my searing lungs. A threat. A brutal demand.  
  
A third time? I couldn't. My se//x is oversensitized and his touch sends bolts of pleasure-pain coursing through me. I writhe against his hand, practically crying. Wishing it would stop but needing it to go on. I can't think, can't breathe. There's only me and him and I've never felt so gloriously out of control.  
  
""Do as you're told, Mia. I'm not letting you up until you come again.""  
  
Lazzaro thrusts hard against my butt through his sweats and his hot breath is on the back of my neck. The hottest man I've ever laid eyes on has me pinned in place, and my body craves to give him what he wants. His brutal assault on my senses forces a third orgasm from me.  
  
I press my face into the pillow and moan, wishing it didn't feel so good to be so thoroughly humiliated.

1p9dtbc,https://i.redd.it/ersaer0c244g1.png,"Take Me, My Stepfather","My eyes snap open, and a scream rises up my throat.





Every muscle in my body goes rigid, and terror claws at my heart. Please let this be a dream. A nightmare.





Directly in front of me is the floor-to-ceiling mirror on the front of my wardrobe, and I stare into my own wide-eyed, terror-stricken reflection. My cheek is pressed into the pillow, and the white ruffled strap of my pajama top has slipped down. A shaft of silver moonlight falls across my comforter, and the clock on my bedside table ticks out every agonizing second. It's nearly one in the morning. The witching hour?





More like the devil's hour.





And the devil's in my bed.





A large, muscular figure is cloaked in darkness. He shifts with a sleepy murmur, and the sheer size of him rocks my whole body. His head is behind mine on the pillow, and I can see little of him except for the dark, silky hair falling across his forehead and the sleeve of his black T-shirt stretched tight around his muscular bicep.





This man is huge. Tall and built like a linebacker. The first time I laid eyes on him, I thought he was uncomfortably, aggressively large, and I still think that every time he walks into a room. I feel like I'm sharing this usually generous bed with a nine-foot demon from hell. His body heat is scorching the backs of my bare legs, and my normally sweet-smelling bedroom is filled with an invasive masculine scent.





I hate this man in the daylight, and I fear him at night. I can't stand him looking at me or even breathing near me, and I absolutely loathe the sensation of his body brushing against mine. Every second of every day, I'm trying to avoid his massive body in the kitchen or ignore the way he glares at me across the dining table. The last place he should be is in my bed. We're not lovers.





We're not even friends.





Lazzaro Rosetti is Mom's twenty-nine-year-old husband, a grade-A asshole, and my new stepfather.





I angle my chin up and sniff the air, trying to catch the scent of alcohol, which might explain why the hell Lazzaro has mistaken my bedroom for the one he shares with Mom, but there's nothing but the aroma of his cologne. I say ""shares,"" but my new stepfather is unpredictable, coming in and out of the house at all hours of the day and night. He's more like a restless animal than a man. Sometimes I catch him sleeping on the sofa or on a deck chair out by the pool. One morning last week, he was sleeping on the living room floor, and I stepped over him on my way to the kitchen. Lazzaro came suddenly alive, grabbing my ankle and refusing to let go as I squealed and tried to shake him off. His grip was an iron manacle, and his green eyes flashed with malice. All the while, he was grinning like this was a game to him.





I managed to kick him in the ribs with my sneaker, and he grunted in pain. Still grinning, he yanked me closer so he could take his revenge by looking up my skirt.





Lazzaro gazed up at me from the floor. ""Mm, white lace. My favorite.""





Cheeks burning with humiliation, I shoved my skirt between my legs. ""You asshole.""





Mom's footsteps could be heard coming down the sweeping marble stairs, and Lazzaro let go of me so fast that I stumbled. By the time she came into the kitchen with a crimson-and-gold silk robe hanging from her elegant shoulders, he was leaning against the kitchen counter, waiting for the coffee machine to finish dispensing a double shot of Colombian roast.





I found my voice a few seconds later. ""Mom, Lazzaro just grabbed me, and he wouldn't let go.""





Lazzaro passed the coffee to Mom, no cream or sugar, just how she likes it. She stared in confusion at his out-of-character thoughtful gesture but then accepted the cup.





""Mia stumbled and I didn't want her to fall and hurt herself,"" he explained mildly.





""That's not what—""





Mom winced and pinched her brow. ""Mia, please keep your voice down. I just woke up. And next time, look where you're going.""





Lazzaro folded his arms across his enormous chest and smirked at me behind his wife's back.





Mom pushed out through the double doors to drink her coffee in the garden. She didn't look at me once. Mom almost never looks at me.





After all these years, you'd think I'd be used to it, but it still hurts being the Bianchi family's shame. Mom's face falls or her eyes skim over me whenever I walk into a room. Grandmother flinches whenever I speak at the dinner table. My three uncles give me stony glares before kissing my older sisters hello warmly.





A vicious whisper sounded in my ear. ""So, it's true. No one believes a single word out of your mouth.""





Lazzaro was standing right behind me. He was so close that I could see every detail of the scar that cuts vertically through his lips on the left-hand side. It gives him a dangerous, roguish appearance, especially when he smiles and bares his strong white teeth.





His vindictive mouth whispered, ""Or maybe it's just that they don't give a fuck what you have to say, and never have.""





Now he's in my bed, and I don't know if it's a mistake or on purpose. But I'm not sticking around to find out. I grasp the edge of the mattress and wriggle my way toward it, staring at our reflections in the mirror and hoping I don't wake him.





Lazzaro's eyes pop open. I catch the feral gleam of his green gaze in the darkness, and my stomach swoops. A slow, nasty smile spreads over his face.





He's not confused.





He knows exactly whose bed he's in.





Chapter 2





MIA





I want to scream, but I don't, because eighteen years on this earth has taught me that no matter what goes wrong, it's always my fault.





If Mom runs in here, Lazzaro will protest that he made an honest mistake.





Mom will tell me I'm attention-seeking, and I'll end up being forced to apologize for causing drama in the middle of the night. I'd rather gargle hot sauce and toilet cleaner than say sorry to this man.





""What are you doing in my room?"" I hiss, holding tight to the blankets.





""Your mom's pissing me off.""





When are they not pissing each other off? Every time they fight, I'm the one who pays for it. Mom walks around slamming doors and shouting. Lazzaro finds me and destroys whatever peace I've found watching TV, swimming in the pool, or reading in the garden.





""Then go and sleep on the sofa.""





""But I like your bed.""





""Then I'll go sleep on the sofa.""





But Lazzaro grabs the back of my pajama top as I try to get out of bed. ""Running off? So fucking rude when I'm being nice to you.""





""How is this nice?"" I exclaim in an outraged whisper.





""Did anyone else talk to you today?""





Tonight, Uncle Tomaso and Aunt Sofia came to dinner with their children, two cousins who are older than me and another who is younger. At one point, I asked one of my cousins how school was going. Aunt Sofia immediately talked over me and changed the subject.





""Screw you,"" I whisper, shuddering with anger and humiliation.





Lazzaro slides an arm beneath me and drags me back against his chest. ""Cold? I'll warm you up.""





His burning hot flesh presses against my back, scorching me from the nape of my neck to my heels. I struggle to get out of his grip, but both of his arms come around me. One of his hands is on my waist and the other is on my bare inner thigh. He's wearing sweats, but as his hips press into me, I feel the telltale ridge of something hard and thick against my ass.





Panicked words fall from my lips. ""What the... is that your... Oh, my God.""





""What's what?"" Lazzaro speaks directly into my ear, his deep voice rumbly and tinged with lust and amusement. I dig my nails into his muscular forearms and grit my teeth against the restless, fluttering feeling low in my belly. He gets off on tormenting me, and he's made that clear from day one. The moment he crossed the threshold into this house after their honeymoon, his expression dark with anger and every muscle bunched beneath his black T-shirt, he zeroed in on me. Someone was going to suffer for what he'd been forced to do, and I'm his perfect victim.





No, it started before that day. Our eyes met at the church altar and his gaze fell to my nipples, which were pebbled into points and painfully obvious through my pink satin bridesmaid gown. It was so cold in the church, they were practically visible from space.





The priest prompted him to say his vows, and he lifted his eyes to mine as he spoke the words, I do.





Like a curse.





Like a threat.





""Why are you torturing me like this? What did I ever do to you?""





In our reflections, Lazzaro's eyes narrow with spite. ""It's nothing personal, Mia. I just hate your fucking family.""





He didn't want to marry Mom, and Mom didn't want to marry him, but it was arranged by our families like something out of the Middle Ages. The Rosetti family wants to force Lazzaro to settle down, and Mom wants some of the power and money that the Rosetti men wield like weapons in this city. Absolutely nothing about their marriage has to do with love. It's pure business.





I lie still for a moment, letting Lazzaro think he's won whatever sick game he's playing. He reaches up and palms one of my breasts like he owns it. My nipple hardens against the friction of his hand, and pleasure courses through me.





I ram my elbow into Lazzaro's stomach and fling myself off the bed. I manage to get to the edge of the mattress before he snatches me back against his hard chest.





""Ah-ah, Mia,"" he taunts. ""Can't have you roaming the house in the middle of the night. Good girls stay in bed.""





I growl with frustration as loud as I dare. ""I hate you,"" I seethe, wrenching myself back and forth in his iron-like grip.





""I hate you more.""





I buck in his arms until his hand lands on my pussy and his fingers curl to cup my sex over my pajama shorts. I inhale sharply. ""What are you doing?""





""Ride my fingers.""





Chapter 3





MIA





""Go to hell,"" I say through gritted teeth. My whole body is rigid as I wait for him to continue my humiliation. To grow bolder. To become an even worse man by invading my clothing. But Lazzaro doesn't move. Instead, he laughs softly, and I see in our reflection that he closes his eyes and relaxes.





""Whatever. They're there if you need them.""





And Lazzaro goes to sleep, leaving his fingers right where they are, tucked against my sex. My heart pounds, and my chest feels like it's about to explode. I take as deep a breath as I can, locked in the cage of Lazzaro's arms. I'll wait until he's asleep and then get the hell out of here.

The absolute shit storm we went through today after yesterday’s shit storm trying to find a way to eat. Today I had a shift from 6am to 5pm. I wanted to make sure I got off earlier so I can pick up the babies & head to the food pantry. Welp to my surprise , we get there & they are closed until Monday & the only one open tomorrow is the next town over. On top of that, the babies behavior this evening after picking them up has been terrible, especially the tantrums that they have decided to throw! My head is going to EXPLODE. 

I feel like I am doomed & it’s humiliating. I am so freaking exhausted working so hard that some days I can’t afford basic necessities. We moved a few years ago due to my job position. I make over the threshold for government assistance & have applied for child-support but doesn’t make a dent in anything. I literally PRAY that my babies see how freaking hard I am trying for them. Mama is tired, exhausted & overwhelmed doing this by myself. My family is non-existent after I cut them off financially from moving. When will this get easier ?

I am disappointed in myself. My elderly neighbor brought us two frozen Hot Pockets & a bag of oranges until I can find a solution. I’m tired of crying. I need sleep. I need coffee. I need friends.  I need peace. I just want my babies to know that I’m doing my best. I love you guys. Never give up.",3,1764384841.0,Parenting,2,1.0,False

— Nam-gyu brags to people that he's friends with a famous youtuber like crazy, just to get what he wants. To win an argument, to put credibility to his name, you name it.

— Myung-gi always DENIES that they're friends, and it genuinely hurts Nam-gyu (he never admits it).

— Namgyu likes creating dating rumors of them together, so he tends to post things deliberately hinting to it. Just to stir the pot.

— Myung-gi's in a constant state of frustration around Nam-gyu, yet he never truly leaves him.

— When Myung-gi does those ""HITTING X MILLION SUBSCRIBERS IN REAL TIME"" stream, Nam-gyu often unsubscribes and subscribes at the 999,999 to piss him off. 

— They go on cafes often, Nam-gyu gets plain black coffee everyday, while Myung-gi gets those loooooong trendy coffee orders.

— Myung-gi avoids having Nam-gyu appear in his channel because he makes everything chaotic, but Nam-gyu always finds a way to just... show up out of nowhere. His subscribers enjoy Nam-gyu's appearances though.

— Nam-gyu has those rare moments of clarity and genuine thoughtfulness time to time in a conversation that Myung-gi secretly enjoys. Normally when it's late at night and they're just talking about themselves. 

— Myung-gi cannot sleep without white noise, while Nam-gyu finds it too distracting to sleep with.

— Remember Nam-gyu singing Love Scenario? He's was a huge K-pop fan during his teenage years, but he'd never admit it now since he looks down on those who enjoy that 'overrated' genre (hypocrite).

— Myung-gi worries when Nam-gyu DOESN'T bother him for too long. At least once, he had to come running to Club Pentagon late at night to make sure Nam-gyu didn't overdose or something.

1p9dnkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1p9dnkm/nobody_believes_that_i_was_kidnapped_by_fairies/,Nobody believes that I was kidnapped by fairies on Christmas Eve.,"Dr. Casey was my latest in the long line of psychologists assigned to me since my so-called mental breakdown. 

Sitting in front of me, her smile was patient and her eyes were trying to be sincere. I liked her office. 

It was a lot cosier than the others. 

The one in Boston had walls that made me feel like I was in a psych ward. 

Sickly green, resembling barf, with too-bright lights and a TV in the waiting room that only played ancient game shows with zero volume. 

Dr. Casey’s office was minimalist with a desk and a bookshelf. 

The decor was warm, purplish blue, an outdated laptop sitting in front of her. 

Unlike my other therapists, she seemed… human. 

While the others had clinical white offices and scary looking posters on the wall bearing mental health disorders and human trafficking warnings, Dr Casey had stained coffee mugs and ancient comic books piled on top of each other.

She chewed on her pen between writing, tapping her feet to a beat only she could hear. 

Which was familiar and relatable. 

My therapist was a beautiful woman, kind, brown flecked eyes and velvet coloured hair tied into an untidy ponytail. 

When she leaned forward and met my gaze, I found myself taken aback by her natural beauty.

She smelled of fresh pine and lemon, and had a smile that wanted to help. 

Dr. Casey made me feel comfortable. 

I thought I could tell her everything. 

So, I started talking. 

Hesitantly at first, but the more I was speaking and actually letting everything out, all of this fear and frustration and anger I had been bottling up for a whole year.

Initially, she seemed interested when I told her the basics, nodding and making comments to assure me she was listening. 

I started telling my story as normally as possible. 

My flight was cancelled on Christmas Eve, and because of my age I had no choice but to join my fellow young travellers inside the unaccompanied minors lounge. 

Dr. Casey kept smiling and scribbling in her notebook until I got into the meat of my trauma. Why I couldn't fully look her in the eye, and even a year later, I still struggled to sit still.

My hands were always wandering, either delving into my lap or playing with stray thread on my jeans, my fingers steepling together, constantly  clammy. 

I could never fully suck air into my lungs during a therapy session. 

I had an odd posture, leaned over myself, my lungs crushed. 

There was never enough air for me to breathe, and my body was constantly too light, like at any moment I would lose contact with the ground all together.

This kind of thing was better to explain by saying, “I had a psychotic break” but I thought I could talk to someone who would listen. Who wouldn't call me crazy. 

I always felt small and childish, hating the words coming from my mouth. 

Eighteen years old, and I still felt so much younger. “I was kidnapped,” I told her, a lump growing in my throat. 

Dr. Casey’s smile faded, eyes darkening. 

I noticed her fingers tighten around the pen. She began to write before pausing, her gaze snapping to me. “Kidnapped?”

I could already see the cogs in her head turning, ready to make phone calls and offer support– maybe even call the police. 

It's not like I didn't look like a kidnapping victim. 

I was sickly pale from malnourishment, my hair hung in tangled streaks in front of my face, and I hadn't bathed in days. 

But my failure to meet basic hygiene was for a completely different reason. 

I didn't know how to tell her I couldn't wash or brush my hair, and I couldn't force food down my throat. They wouldn't let me. 

When I spoke of them, she leaned forward with wide, sympathetic eyes that were going to listen, urging me to take my time. 

She thought they were human, an abusive family member or significant other. 

That was until I dropped my gaze, shuffling uncomfortably on my chair. 

It had been the same leather chair for three weeks, and I still couldn't get comfortable. 

The upholstery felt wrong grazing the backs of my jeans. I had been nervously picking on it since starting my session. 

I had been skating around the subject of my depressive episodes. 

Because when I eventually let loose and went into detail, I always lost them. 

I lost my therapists with one single word. 

“Kidnapped,” I said again, “By fairies.”

Dr. Casey stopped writing, her lip twitching slightly. She lifted her head. 

“You were kidnapped by fairies,” her brow shot into her hairline. 

Dr. Casey’s expression crumpled into what might have been sympathy before confusion and amusement took over. 

Before I could respond, she cleared her throat a little too harshly, and spoke the words my last five therapists had said with the exact tone. “Miss Jaimison, aren't you a little old to still believe in fairies?” 

Yes, I was. 

I didn't even believe in them when I was a little kid, and now I was being hunted by them. In the space of a year, fairies, and to an extent, Santa Clause were real. 

Dr. Casey sighed when I didn't reply.  

“Okay then, Ruby,” she continued to scribble in her notebook. 

Her smile was still polite, though a little strained. Just like the others. 

“Why don't you talk me through what happened?” 

I started to, but she cut me off. 

“Miss Jaimison, there is nothing wrong with disguising your mental trauma with fantasy. It's common with young people.”

Fantasy? 

Was she fucking serious?

I knew the difference between reality and fantasy. 

For the last several months, both had blurred into each other, enveloping me completely. To other people, fantasy was what they saw on TV or read in books. 

The fae folk, beings of light and beauty hiding amongst the flowers. 

Which was the fantasy I grew up with. 

That fantasy, however, had been haunting me since I escaped my fate to become an heir of the kingdom. 

It existed in the tricks that woke me up at night, open windows when I was sure I'd shut them, and poison ivy between my sheets, my possessions being whisked away. That was a warning.

When I refused to submit, they bled inside my brain and made me question my own reality. I coughed up my own blood and teeth, lost clumps of my hair.

They wouldn't let me shower, or brush my hair, or eat. 

They were constantly there, whispering and giggling in my ear, murmuring nursery rhymes in their language, their songs all entangled with my lost friends' names. 

These little bastards tugged on my hair when nobody was watching, a symphony of childish giggles entwined in my skull. 

“It's not… fantasy,” I spoke coolly and calmly, but in the corner of my eye, I could see sharp flickers of movement. 

“It's real,” I whispered. “I was taken to a different world where fairies exist.” 

She nodded, continuing to write. “Okay, and would you say you were awake during this, uh… this venture? You said you were falling asleep in an airport terminal, correct?” 

Dr. Casey nodded at me with a smile. 

“Do you think maybe you experienced a vivid fever dream?” 

“No.” I swatted at my own face again. I could hear giggles. They were laughing at me. “No, I was definitely awake,” I spoke through gritted teeth. “I wasn't alone either. There was a group of kids with me, and there were these screens that…” 

I caught hold of myself. “I know it sounds crazy, but,” I struggled with my hands, stuffing them into my lap. 

“These screens… the ones in the room they took us to. They hypnotised kids into thinking they didn't have parents.” 

“Mmm hmm.” Dr. Casey lifted her gaze. “So, are we talking, like, mind control?”

I nodded. “Yes. There was this Christmas themed animation playing, and it put my friend into a weird trance.” 

I felt my own secondhand embarrassment, resisting the urge to rake my nails down my face. 

“It made him think he was an orphan. Just like everyone else. I saw it too, and I can't explain it.” my hands were wandering again, this time streaking through filthy strands of my hair. 

I could feel them tugging my scalp. It was an endless tug of war with them. 

Still though, thinking back to their influence on me, that for a single moment with my eyes captured by their magic, my mind drowned by their light and lullabies, I thought I was an orphan myself. 

It was so vivid. I had been suffocated with false memories of an orphanage I never attended; wooden bunk beds and children that were not real. 

These things had planted fake thoughts, fake feelings and memories inside my brain, enchanting me and luring me in, before I had snapped out of it with the help of Levi and Thalia. 

I didn't realise I was choking all of that out, words tangling from my lips, my voice splintering, until I was handed a tissue, and I swiped at my eyes. 

I didn't mean to say any of that out loud, but saying their names, or at least revisiting the memories I had tried to suppress, was a surprising weight off my chest. 

Dr. Casey continued writing. She was scribbling way too much to just be making notes. “Okay, and who was this friend?” she looked up at me, lips quirked into a smile. She wasn't laughing at me. 

This was a sympathy smile. She thought I was fucking crazy. 

I tried to lean across the desk to see what she was writing, but she easily hid her notebook from my prying eyes. 

“Was he an, um, a ‘fairy person’ too?”

“Jude Whitlock,” I whispered. 

His name didn't feel real or right on my tongue, almost like he didn't exist anymore. 

“No. He was a human, and they took him along with the others.” 

I played with the thread on my jeans. 

“He was the worst affected. I think because he, uh, he already felt detached from his parents. So, it wasn't hard for them to wipe them from his memory.” 

I straightened up in my seat. “Jude didn't have a good relationship with his Mom.”

Dr. Casey cocked a brow. “Oh?” 

“Yeah.  He said he only got to spend time with her two days a year.”

She paused writing, tapping her pen. “And you haven't seen him since?”

I shook my head. “No. The last time I saw him, he was completely under their control.”

“Their… fairy mind control?” Dr. Casey cleared her throat. Something flickered in her expression. I saw her write *separation* followed by a question mark. 

“And did you say the other kids…” she flicked back through the pages of her notebook. 

“Levi and Thalia. Were they taken too?”

Nodding, I squeezed my eyes shut. 

“Yes. But they were replaced by fake versions. I think they're called changelings.”

“Uh-huh.” she chewed on her pen. “So, to go over, your human friends were kidnapped by fairies and replaced with…” 

She nodded at her notebook, “replicas of them, that are called Strays.”

I shook my head. “No, the Strays are different. They're not wanted, and given back to the human world. They're previously kidnapped kids no longer wanted.”

She met my gaze. “And have you met a Stray?”

I did. 

When I was saved by the kind fae who brought me back, there were two Strays in the car.

I still remembered their battered and bruised faces, skeletal figures and haunted eyes. 

I remembered the markings on the boy's head from his crown, his flesh shredded and burned, sliced and ripped apart. 

The slits in the girl's back, where a semblance of wings may have been before being cruelly sliced away. 

I never saw them again. 

There were hunters on earth who specifically went for Stray kids. I was told they were  worth millions to humans.

“I did,” I admitted. “But they ran away before I could talk to them.”

“Ahh, of course. They ran away.” 

I stuffed my fists in my lap, trying to breathe. “You think I'm crazy.” 

Dr. Casey dropped her pen with a sigh, her gaze flicking to me. “Well, at least you're self aware. Honestly, this all sounds a little far fetched. I am not supposed to be harsh with my patients, but you are an exceptional case.” she inclined her head. 

“Ruby, how exactly did you get it into your head that you're being hunted by fairies? This world,” she glanced at her notebook. 

“All of these  things. Your friends being kidnapped and uh… half fairy kids spirited away, child eating plants, magical doorways and stray kids being hunted down. It’s not really real, is it?” 

Here we go.

“Ruby, the world is boring. And I don't blame you for creating this world inside your head.""

Dr. Casey offered me another sympathetic smile. 

“You are an intelligent young woman and you don't seem to be suffering from either neurological trauma or PTSD.” she tapped her manicure on the edge of her desk, rechecking over her notes. 

“Do you think you may have an overactive imagination? These friends you talk about.” I watched her fingers drum a single beat. 

“Levi, Jude, and Thalia. Are they perhaps people you strayed away from?""

Dr. Casey talked with her hands a lot. “It's possible that you have created a fantasy  to cope with losing their company.” she leaned back, her smile a lot more patient and understanding than all of the others. 

But she still didn't believe me. 

I think those words were what broke me. Not telling me I was too old to believe in fairies, or implying I had psychosis. She was telling me friends I lost were not real.

Just delusions of my mind. And if they were real, they were past friendships I was dwelling on and clinging onto.

Something splintered inside me. “I can't breathe,” I managed to grit out. “I feel like I've lost half of my breath since coming back, and sometimes I can't suck in air,” my voice broke. “It feels like I'm suffocating.” 

My therapist cocked her head. “That sounds a lot like asthma, Ruby.” she leaned forward. “Do you think maybe you're suffering from panic attacks?”

“They're not panic attacks!” I surprised myself with a yell. “They stole my breath!”

“Who stole your breath?” 

“The fairies!” I swallowed my words, clawing out my hair, pulling it from a particularly violent tugging match between two sets of tiny hands. “I mean fae... I think they're…referred to as fae?”

“Yes, I believe that is what they are called.” 

Her deadpan tone was starting to get under my skin. 

“Can't you see them?” I hissed out, holding out a strand of my hair. “They're right here!”

Dr. Casey’s mouth hung open, like she was struggling to coerce words. Before she could speak though, her gaze snapped to behind me, her expression twisting. “Liam, this is a private session!” 

I twisted around in my chair, meeting eyes with a boy who was my age. 

Hiding behind a bed of dark blonde curls, his eyes were wide with terror, parted lips moving like he was trying to speak, but failing. 

His gaze was frenzied, almost feral. 

It only took a single glance where intricate lines of ink danced across his forehead, like a child had been using his face as a canvas, for me to know what he was. 

Dr.  Casey was blind to the state of him, and he knew I'd noticed it, quickly yanking the hood of his sweater over his head. 

“Shut the door! I'm with a patient. I'll be with you in a moment.” 

The boy shot me a look, like he was trying to speak, before nodding and stumbling back into the waiting room, quietly shutting the door behind him. 

“Please excuse Liam, he's one of my patients. He doesn't know the meaning of privacy.” 

My therapist turned back to me, her expression relaxing. “Have you spoken to your parents about any of this? Do they offer their support?”

“No.”

I didn't mean to raise my voice, but I felt like I was being ripped apart inside. 

Parents were a sore subject. 

Just because I escaped the kingdom didn't mean I wasn't replaced too. 

There was a girl with my face living with my Mom and Dad. A girl with too-pale skin, a playfulness in eyes full of mischief.

I watched her meet my father at the airport. Ever since then, my life had been on a downward spiral. 

I choked up bloodstained flowers daily. I lost my teeth. There were vines growing at the back of my throat, markings I couldn't explain on my legs and arms. Like I had already been branded as theirs. 

Marked for the hunt. 

“I’m not crazy,” I whispered, trying to ignore my hair being yanked and pulled from side to side by tiny fingers. 

“I’ve lost my parents to a thing that looks exactly like me,” I hissed out. “I've lost half of my breath. There is a constant chokehold around my neck squeezing breath from my lungs. They're slowly killing me.” 

When I jumped up, Dr. Casey flinched slightly, like I was going to attack her.

“I'm constantly light on my feet,” I continued. “I feel like I'm floating. Like I'm never really touching the floor.”

Sinking back into my chair, I couldn't resist a sob. “They send me… warnings.” 

Dr. Casey hummed. “Warnings? Okay, and do you have them here with you?”

I thought back to the confused look on my Boston therapist’s face when I tried to hand her an old piece of parchment I'd found glued to my window with the remnants of my roommate's cat. 

The parchment was an invite into the kingdom and to accept my crown as an adopted heir to the court. 

The calligraphy was always graceful, beautiful, scrawled in human blood. 

I dropped my gaze, losing all my bravado. 

“It's…it's invisible to adults.”

Risking a glance, I could see the muscles in my therapist’s face twitching. 

Casey’s lip curled. I was losing her. “These warnings that are haunting you are… invisible to adults?” 

She cleared her throat. “Okay, so your kidnapped friends have been replaced by fairy replicas, and you are being haunted by a fairy kingdom, but their warnings are completely invisible to adults.”

I thought back to Liam. “And what they do to you,” I added. The markings and brandings. It's all invisible to adults.”

I could tell Dr. Casey was losing her patience. Still though, I was surprised she held out this long. 

The Boston therapist gave up at the start. 

“Miss Jaimison, you are eighteen years old which is classified as an adult.” 

I jumped when she dropped her pen on her desk. “Go home, Ruby.”

The woman nodded at me to stand up, and I did, grabbing my bag. “I don't think we need to continue this conversation.” 

Before I could protest, her phone rang, and she picked it up. 

“Yes,” My therapist lowered her voice, gesturing for me to shoo like I was a rabid raccoon. “Uh huh. Yes. Perfect condition. Yeah, I'm in the possession of…” she trailed off, meeting my gaze. 

“It.”

Dr Casey cleared her throat, irritation pricking in her eyes. 

“Ruby, I believe we are finished talking. Have a nice evening.” she went back to her phone. “Yes, I've got it with me. Mmm. Yeah, like I'd said, zero scratches or marks.”

When she collapsed into hissed whispers, I strode towards the door, only for something to catch my eye. On her bookshelf were tiny wooden fairies bearing wide smiles and intricate wings.

These things looked cute and playful. They looked nothing like the beings that kidnapped my friends. I couldn't resist turning around, my gut twisting. 

“Do you collect those things?”

Dr. Casey turned to me, her phone still glued to her ear. “Sorry, what was that?”

I pointed to the figures. “Those fairies. Do you collect them?”

Her gaze flitted to the figures, lips curving into a smile. “You could say that,” she pointed to her phone. “I'm actually in the middle of selling them right now, so if you wouldn't mind…” 

Before I could answer, I was already being escorted out of her office, the door slamming in my face. In the waiting room, the boy from earlier was sitting cross legged on a plastic chair. 

My heart leapt into my throat. 

I knew it wasn't him, but the way he was sitting, tense, dark eyes following me across the waiting room, like a caged animal, he reminded me of Jude.  

The last thing I said to him was reminding him he had a mother and a sister. 

But he had been far too gone to hear me, enveloped in their fairy dust. 

Unlike Jude, who previously had a destination, his parents house, this kid looked tragically lost. 

He purposely bowed his head to hide himself, but I already knew who and what he was. 

I could see exactly where his disgraced crown had sat on top of thick blonde curls. 

“You're a Stray.” I said, folding my arms. 

“Go away.” He shied away from me, shuffling back like a wild animal. The boy pressed his head into his lap. “They already know your name,” he sniffled.

His voice was rough. 

I could hear the turmoil and torture he had gone through. I wondered how long Liam had been inside the kingdom. From the way he was acting, he must have been young. “You can't run from them.”

A shiver skittered down my spine. “How did you escape?”

Liam looked up, his lips splitting into a grotesque smile of razor sharp teeth. 

“I was replaced.”

I nodded slowly, swatting at a tiny ball of golden light hovering in front of my eyes. 

Liam’s gaze followed its manic dance, his eyes narrowing. 

“My friends were taken,” I said, “Is there any chance they could be given back?”

Liam cocked his head. “Do they have your friends' names?”

I thought back to the list of naughty and nice. 

Yes. They had their full names. 

“Yes,” I said in a hiss of breath. “But–” 

“Liam?” Dr. Casey’s door flew open, her head poking out. 

I tried to ignore the boy flinching, the way his body seemed to lurch back. “Would you like to come in?” her gaze snapped to me. 

“Ruby. Go home please.”

I glanced at Liam, who looked panicked. 

“Do you… want to go in there?” I asked him. 

“Liam.” Dr. Casey’s tone hardened. 

He nodded with a quiet, “Yes” before ducking his head and following her into the office. When the door clicked shut behind them, I thought back to the miniature fairies sitting on her bookshelf. 

I hovered outside the door for a few more minutes, before swiftly leaving. 

I was on my way down the stairs to the reception area, when two men shoved past me on their way up. 

Dr. Casey told me to go home, so I did.

That night I woke up coughing up blood stained flowers, vines stuck between my teeth and blossoming at the back of my throat. They weren't just haunting me mentally, they were playing with my body. 

There was something there, twisted and sandwiched, stuffed down my throat. 

Standing in front of a mirror with tweezers, I forced the two blades into the back of my mouth, pinching a single vine. 

When I pulled it from my lips, my throat ruptured and I choked up blood tinged petals, and a growing tendril of earth entangled with a single strand of hair. 

Thalia. 

Her long red hair stuck in my memory, and now it was clogging my faucet and shower drain.

Thalia’s hair was the first real warning that they were coming. 

Quickly followed by a shred of Levi’s hoodie.

And then, Jude's private school sweater. 

It was always pieces of them, nothing was ever whole. All I got were torn remnants and fragments of what had been real. 

It felt like a tease, like they were dangling my friends in front of me. 

Cutting them apart, piece by piece. 

Until nothing remained. 

I grew sicker. Paler. Pulling scarlet streaked flowers from my lips and coughing up clumps of Thalia’s hair became a daily occurrence. 

I was barely conscious in class when the air around me suddenly stilled, a streak of shivers spiderwebbing down my bones. 

I could barely concentrate on the class itself, beforehand, white noise screaming in my ears. Now it was too silent. 

Like all the sound had been sucked into a vacuum. Even the sounds of light typing, brief conversations and pages flipping over. Everything had come to an eerie stop. Lifting my head, it wasn't just the sound. Movement had come to halt too. 

My professor stood at the front of the class. He was frozen, glued to the spot. 

But his eyes were still moving, frantically snapping left and right.

Around me, my classmates were paralysed to their seats. 

The ponytailed blonde next to me was mid-drinking her water. She was frozen, while water sloshed down her throat. 

I could sense that she was choking, her cheeks turning red and then purple. 

But she couldn't move. The sound of water filling her gut, her stomach expanding, sent my own catapulting into my throat. 

It took me a disorienting moment to realise the wave that had enveloped my class had taken me too. 

Glued to my chair, I caught a flash of movement in the corner of my eye. 

There was a shadow moving down the aisle, a figure drowned in light so bright I couldn't see a face. 

When a sharp breath sounded next to me, and the girl with the water dropped to the ground, I thought it was just her. 

But when it came again, another hiss of breath, and then another, students collapsing like dominoes, I knew exactly what was happening. 

It was pulling their breath from their lungs, teasing it, before tearing it from their lips. 

Bodies continued to drop around me. 

I could sense it, almost see it, wisps of dancing white being dragged from parted lips and disappearing into nothing. 

The lights flickered above me. 

I saw feet moving toward me, dancing down the steps. 

Closer. 

Under dull light, I glimpsed the torn remnants of a navy blue sweater clinging to a skeletal figure. The closer he came to me, I felt my own breath leave my lungs and squirm its up my throat, forced through my lips. But it didn't leave me.

Not yet.

When he stopped in front of me, the lingering students around me toppling off of their chairs, he teased my breath, once, and then twice, holding it between my frozen lips, letting me slowly suffocate. 

When my professor dropped, the lights brightened. The figure was no longer a shadow, a being that was once human. 

It still bared a human face, remnants of its old self. I wasn't sure what to call him. Beautiful, or maybe horrifying. 

I couldn't tear my gaze from his skin, flesh that had been battered and burned, branded and used as a canvas. 

There were intricate lines of black dancing his cheeks, just like Liam. But while Liam’s had been old, faded, his were wet and fresh. I could still see the gleam, imagine the dripping paintbrush. 

There was so much wrong with him. Malnourished cheeks and skin so pale and brittle, like the pages of a book. 

And yet I still found a sick sense of beauty, that grotesque and breathtaking beauty I remembered from their world. 

I had nightmares of him being twisted and contorted into one of them. But it was real. I had aged since our kidnapping. 

A whole year had gone by. Jude, however, was still frozen at sixteen years old. 

Dark brown curls adorned with flowers and thorns, a crown of bone sitting on top of his head. I could see sharp pieces of bone sliced into his flesh, old and new rivers or red streaking down his face. 

His lips carved into a feral smile that greeted me. 

No longer human and forever sixteen years old, I still recognised him. Jude suited his crown. 

He suited his smile, too-pointy teeth and eyes filled with mischief. 

Jude never had human parents, or at least ones that cared about him. Maybe that was why he had accepted his fate. 

Accepted his crown.

After all, what 16 year old human boy wouldn't want to be the heir to a fairy court? 

What he didn't suit, was the bruises and burns, his body twisted into a plaything for the Kingdom. Jude looked both human and fae, twin slits in his back, flaps of flesh resembling their sick idea of wings. 

I waited for him to take my breath. 

He did, tearing it to and from my lips like I was his own personal toy. 

When he was bored, Jude reached out his hand, finally, his eyes lighting up. 

I pretended not to see the scalding marks covering his arms. 

The rugged flesh on the backs of his hands. 

“Ruuuuuuuuby.”

From the look on his face, and the whispered giggles in my ear, him laughing with the fireflies buzzing around me tugging on my hair, I didn't have a choice. 

He made that clear when he violently ripped breaths from my lungs, one by one. 

I accepted his hand when I could move again, gulping in oxygen. 

Jude didn't speak to me. But he did speak to the things still clinging to my hair, giggling in their tongue twisting language. 

We left the room, his claw-like fingernails digging into my skin. 

He told me my classmates were not harmed.

However, they were missing a significant chunk of their breath. 

“Your sister,” I managed to get out, when he pulled me through the dark. I didn't even notice the passage of time. He could have had my breath for hours. 

Something rancid crept up my throat, and I spat out another explosion of red. 

More of Thalia’s hair stuck to my lips, glued to my chin. 

“Did you find her?”

He surprised me with an inhuman grin that was not his, a glitter in his eyes that was both insanity and glee. 

Jude had their exact mannerisms, their twitching smiles and gleeful eyes. 

He was a bigger version of the fireflies trying to rip my hair from my scalp, laughing along with them. “What sister?”

I was wrong.

I thought Jude still had lingering humanity. 

But he was completely gone. 

I knew where he was taking me. Jude took me back to the nightmare world that I had been told multiple times wasn't real. 

The world filled with child-eating plants, and the wooden cage filled with human children that I had escaped. 

I didn't feel as light back in their world. 

I felt like I could breathe again, my bare feet grazing the floor. 

I wasn't expecting the reception Jude got when he dragged me through streets threaded with plants and vines. 

Beings with painfully beautiful faces and horrifying twisted and contorted bodies dropped to their knees in front of him. 

The ground became harder to tread through, vines and flowers with minds of their own twisting around my ankles. Jude pulled me through them, laughing. 

Quickly, it turned to bones we were wading through. 

Humans. 

These things didn't just forcefully adopt  people. 

They murdered them, proudly brandishing their horrified looking faces. 

Stumbling after Jude, I scanned each kill. 

Levi and Thalia. They couldn't be here, right? 

Looking back, I think part of me wished they were. The palace was not what I was expecting; a building made purely of human bone and entangled vines, a towering structure standing over the court.

The guards standing in front of the doors bowed when Jude stepped through the door. While the exterior of the palace was exactly what I was expecting inside a fae court, the interior surprised me. 

I could tell the fae stole not just children, but human possessions. 

Glittering chandeliers hung from the ceiling, a staircase made purely of rose quartz.

The ground was made up of patchwork human flooring, carpet and marble with pieces of plastic, woven with thick greenery. 

In front of me loomed two thrones made up of entangled vine, the King and Queen, adorned in the remnants of children, blood and bone decorating them.

The Queen wore an adult human skull, velvet coloured hair framing a heart shaped face. Her clothes were patchwork, a dress made of white silk. 

She looked human at first glance, before her features were narrowing, like she was screwing with my perception. 

Jude lowered himself in front of them, yanking me with him.

Kneeling in front of the king, I could still see the skeletal smile of the victim sitting on top of his head. 

I could see exactly where their head had been savagely severed from their torso. 

His clothes were made up of flesh that had been dried and stitched together. I had to bow my head, swallowing a shriek. 

“He's wearing someone's skull,” I managed to breathe, my chest aching. 

Jude shot me a glare, and there was a splinter of his human self. “Be quiet.” 

Oh, so he could speak. 

The Queen stood, and spoke in a language I could not understand. 

Looking at Jude, at the knot between his brow, he could hear what she was saying in perfect clarity. To me, however, it was a colourful tongue twister language. 

“She’s asking all of her children to present themselves to her,” he murmured. 

“What does that mean?” 

“That something big is about to happen,” Jude  hummed. 

“Stand up. The Queen asks her children to present themselves to her only three times a day. Dawn, high eve, and late eve.” 

“What?”

He didn't reply, the sound of footsteps taking me off guard. They took their places next to the King and Queen.

I recognised Levi immediately, still dressed in the remnants of his Adventure Time sweater. 

His hair was overgrown, skin blistered and burned resembling a Stray. 

Unlike Jude's, his crown looked like it had been forced onto his head, splinters of bone glued to his skull, threaded vines and flowers adorning his hair. Levi’s eyes were empty of that glitter I remembered, when he called fake Santa a meth head. 

His smile was too wide. I could see blisters on his mouth where his lips had been sewn shut. I didn't want to see it, but I saw the exact transformation, slight points in ears hiding behind thick reddish curls, his face narrower, malnourished cheeks sticking out.

Following those same inky black lines marking his face, I wondered if male fae bore them. Just from looking at Levi Parish, the boy had fought a battle he had lost, ending in him bearing a crown forced on his head, and vacant eyes. 

Next to him…Thalia. 

She was perhaps the most transformed from the three. Her naked back had been twisted into something inhuman. 

I could see where her spine used to be, now something was growing from her flesh, something writhing up and down her skin, trying to burst out. Thalia’s hair was entangled in flowers and vines, a crown of thorn sitting on top of her head, instead of glued on like the boy's. 

Half of her pretty face had been scorched, and then clawed away, ugly flaps of flesh where her cheek was supposed to be. 

I could still see the claw marks on her neck, streaks of red. 

And yet, just like the boys, her grin was wide. 

The smile I knew was gone.

Looking at all three of them, it hit me that my friends weren't heirs to the throne. 

They were toys. 

Playthings.

Canvases for fae children. 

“Mother.” Jude lifted his head, smiling wide. “Father.” 

“Ruby.” The Queen’s voice was melodic. She rose gracefully. “I am so glad you finally came to your senses.”

I lifted my head.  “I had no choice.”

“Careful.” Jude breathed. “The last time I spoke back to them, I got the flesh melted off of my back.”

The Queen's lips curled. “Human child, do speak louder. You are mumbling.”

Instead of responding, I bowed my head. I was speaking before I could stop myself. “I’d like to… make a request.” 

“And what is that?” The Queen asked, tilting her head. “Speak clearly, Ruby.”

“An exchange.” I forced out. ""I would like to request that I exchange myself, Thalia Wednesday, Levi Parish and…” 

I struggled to speak, the words tangled on my tongue. My gaze flicked to Jude’s bruised knees, the thorns wrapped around this neck which were constantly squeezing breath from his lungs. “And Jude Whitlock.” I spat out. “For four human children of the same age.""

I stopped when Jude grabbed my arm, his eyes suddenly fearful. Terrified. His lips were twisted, failing to form words.

“What are you doing?!” His expression screamed.

“I accept.” 

I risked lifting my head, and she was smiling. 

“Ruby, you are yet to become my full blooded daughter, and you are already pledging yourself to rounding up human children!” She spoke with a manic giggle. 

“My, now how could I reject an offer like that? We are already in a deal for fifteen children this Christmas. Five more would be a luxury. Oh, the things we could do.""

Her words sent slithers down my spine. “No.” I said. “No, I didn’t mean—“

My feet left the ground, and I was choking, suddenly. The breath had been sucked from my lungs, and I felt them.. invisible fingers wrapped around my neck, squeezing. I was aware of my body hovering several feet off of the ground. 

The Queen sat back down. 

“You did not mean what?”

“I…”

“I don’t think you’ve been educated in our laws,” she said smoothly. “You do not speak my children's names. Do so again, and I will rip out your tongue.”

A fountain of red escaped my mouth, and I could feel something sharp winding its way around my neck. Like claws, it stabbed into my flesh. 

I felt my head spin, my vision blur. I was going to die, I thought. I was going to fucking die at eighteen years old, when my replica was out there living my life— and there I was choking on my own blood.

When I dropped to the ground, the Queen cleared her throat. “Speak clearly. You didn’t mean what?”

I couldn’t speak. The words were shredded in my throat.

“She didn’t mean to bad mouth you, Mother.” Jude hissed out. “The… human child has a sharp tongue, and I ask just this once. Please spare her request, and her stupidity. What Ruby meant was a gift,” he said. 

“She will gift you four human children in exchange for your kindness and hospitality. As well as your forgiveness and a seat in the court.”

He wrenched me to my feet and dragged me in a bow. 

My chest was aching, blood dripping from my mouth and chin. But I bowed. 

I bowed three times. And each one was progressively more humiliating. 

When my face hit the ground for the third time, the Queen cleared her throat.

“I accept!” her eyes lit up. “Ruby, you must be so hungry! Please! Eat!”

A table was brought in filled with fruit and berries, and further down the table, a human teenager skewered on a stick. 

His mouth was wide open, teeth pulled out, a bright red apple stuffed inside.

That was when my mind started to slowly break apart. 

When the half human, half fae heirs began to rip flesh from bone, giggling manically, chewing through splattered scarlet dripping from the table. Jude handed me a goblet and told me to drink. It tasted like strawberry milk.  

The windchimes started in my head, growing louder until I was laughing myself, choking on a scream trying to claw its way up my throat. 

When my crown was lowered onto my head, pricks of glass and bone cutting into my scalp, warm blood slipping down my temple, I felt dizzying happiness and unbridled fear, my lips splitting into a grin that wasn't mine. 

I was home. 

I don't know how long it had been since the feast. 

Since the crown on my head stopped hurting, and blood started like tasting like milkshakes.

I was dancing, a whirlwind of color around me, dancing inside the wooden cage, dancing for my life. If my audience did not like my dancing, then I would be punished. 

I was twirling around and around, my thoughts cotton candy, until I stamped on something. 

Something…sharp. 

Something that went straight through my bare foot. 

A nail. 

The pain was enough to wake me up, and when I was blinking rapidly, drinking in the pooling red I had been dancing in, a river of blood staining my legs, did I look up. 

His crown of thorns was still glued to his head but I could see claw marks where he'd tried and failed to pull it off. 

Levi. 

He was awake.

1p9dmvy,https://i.redd.it/98bplvep044g1.png,Think Unhooking My Bra to Make Her Laugh Was Funny? The Judge Didn't,"To defend his ""girl best friend,"" my boyfriend deliberately pulled down my bikini strap during swim class.





The second it slipped, every guy in the pool started hooting and hollering.





I scrambled to cover myself, but my boyfriend pinned my hands down.





""Why are you covering up? With a body like that, consider it a public service!""





In that moment, everything I thought we had—every sweet memory, every loving gesture—shattered completely.





I finally saw him for who he really was.





You like to laugh? Fine.





Let's see if you're still laughing when we're standing in court.





...





Jax's grip is like iron—he's got both my wrists locked behind my back, and no matter how hard I struggle, I can't break free.





His lips are right against my ear, his breath hot on my neck as he whispers.





""Vera, who are you trying to fool?""





""You're usually such a tease, aren't you?""





""Didn't you just call Sienna a pick-me girl?""





""If she's a pick-me, what does that make you? Some innocent little virgin? You act all pure and innocent, but deep down you're wilder than anyone here.""





""This is just a little taste of what you deserve. Say one more word about Sienna and I swear I'll leak those bedroom videos for the whole school to see.""





My heart sinks like a stone.





So when he swam over earlier saying he'd ""fix my strap""—that was all just revenge for Sienna?





Without his hands holding it up, my bikini top slides completely off and floats away in the water.





There it is—white fabric drifting in front of me—and the guys around us are going absolutely feral, hooting and hollering like animals.





My head's spinning with a mix of humiliation, rage, and shame—everything hitting me all at once.





""Jax, get your hands off me! What the hell is wrong with you?!""





But he just laughs, like this is all some big joke to him.





""Vera, you've got such a sick body. Why not share the wealth with everyone?""





""Consider it a public service, babe!""





The guys are eating this up—some of them are literally getting turned on right in front of me.





Jax's bros are calling him a legend, saying they can't believe he'd strip his own girlfriend just to give them all a show.





Someone whistles.





""Damn, Vera's always so quiet in class—who knew she was hiding all that under her clothes?""





""Jax, you lucky bastard!""





""That body? Shit, I can't even imagine—""





""Jax, let go of me!""





""This is sexual assault! I could call the cops right now!""





I'm fighting like hell but the harder I struggle, the tighter he squeezes my wrists—





I can literally hear my bones creaking under the pressure.





When I threaten to call the cops, Sienna chimes in from the sidelines with this fake-sweet voice. ""Girl, he's your boyfriend. You really gonna have him arrested over this?""





Jax scoffs at me like I'm being ridiculous.





""You? Call the cops? You don't have the guts.""





""I'm your boyfriend, Vera. You report me and everyone's gonna think you're some psycho girlfriend who can't take a joke.""





In Jax's eyes, I've always been this soft, meek, timid little thing who'd never stand up for herself.





Makes sense—when we first met, I was this helpless girl getting harassed by two drunk creeps.





Chapter 2





It was summer, about a year ago.





I was eating Korean BBQ by myself at this late-night spot near campus.





Out of nowhere these two wasted dudes slid into the booth across from me and started running their mouths—asking for my number, saying they'd take me somewhere ""fun.""





I ignored them completely, which apparently pissed them off.





Then one of them straight-up put his hands on me, grabbing at my arm.





The whole restaurant could see what was happening, but not a single person stepped up to help.





I'm yelling at them to back off, telling them I'm calling the cops if they don't stop.





That must've set him off because he raised his hand to slap me right across the face.





But the slap never came—





When I opened my eyes, Jax was standing between us, his hand catching the guy's wrist mid-swing.





""Hitting women? That's pathetic, dude.""





Then Jax's fist connected with the drunk's face, and all three of them went at it until the restaurant staff called 911.





We all ended up at the police station—me, Jax, and the two drunks.





Jax took on both of them and somehow walked away without a scratch, while those two looked like they'd been through a meat grinder.





Since it was self-defense, the drunks got detained and Jax got released.





Outside the station, I couldn't stop crying—partly from shock, partly from relief.





Jax looked annoyed by my tears.





""Why are you crying? You didn't even get hit.""





That just made me cry harder, and I managed to choke out between sobs, ""I've never... I've never been to a police station before.""





Then he actually laughed at that.





He ruffled my hair and told me to get home safe, that it was late.





I mentioned I was a student here, and he said same.





When I told him I went to Ashford University, his eyes went wide with surprise.





""No way—me too!""





Our whole meet-cute was straight out of some cheesy rom-com, like a total hero-saves-damsel moment.





Maybe it was guilt, maybe I felt like I owed him my life or something—either way, from that day forward I was basically glued to Jax's side.





I'd bring him breakfast every morning, buy him coffee between classes, pick up medicine when he was sick, wait outside his lecture halls.





One day he looked at me with this knowing smile and asked:





""Vera, do you like me or something?""





Under the golden sunset light, my face went burning red and I couldn't meet his eyes.





Then he leaned down and kissed me, soft and sweet.





""Good,"" he whispered against my lips. ""Because I like you too.""





So when did everything start going wrong?





Probably junior year—right around when Sienna transferred in.





Chapter 3





I'm biting my lip so hard I can taste blood, barely holding myself together as I force the words out.





""Jax, we're done. This is over.""





""And I'm pressing charges against you—count on it.""





Jax absolutely hates being threatened, especially in front of other people.





His smile vanishes instantly and his grip on my wrists tightens until I can feel my bones grinding together.





""Vera, what the fuck did you just say?""





""Say it again. I dare you!""





Sienna tries playing peacemaker, stepping closer with this fake-concerned expression.





""Girl, Jax was just messing around with you. Why are you being so dramatic about this?""





Ha. Stripping your girlfriend naked in front of a crowd of guys? That's just ""messing around"" to them.





The other guys start piling on too. ""Jax, dude, you're so whipped right now!""





""Can't believe you're getting bossed around by your girl like this.""





Jax lives and breathes for his reputation—me embarrassing him in front of his boys is the worst thing I could possibly do. His jaw's clenched so tight I can actually hear his teeth grinding together.





He scans the pool area and calls out, ""Anyone got their phone on them?""





My stomach drops like a stone.





What the hell is he planning now?





Phones aren't allowed in swim class for two reasons—one, water damage risk, and two, the school doesn't want people taking creepshots.





Sienna immediately raises her hand. ""I brought mine.""





Jax grins at her, and it's the most predatory expression I've ever seen on his face.





""Perfect. Take pictures of her—all of her, just like this.""





""She wants to threaten me with cops?""





He wrenches my wrists back even harder, and pain shoots up both my arms like fire.





""Vera, you go ahead and call the cops if you want—I'll blast these photos all over the school forum for everyone to see.""





""Let the whole fucking campus see what a whore you really are.""





Sienna whips out her phone without hesitation and starts snapping away at me.





Click click click.





She's actually grinning while she does it. ""Girl, your body is absolutely unreal! If I were a guy, I'd be completely obsessed with you too!""





Only after she's taken what feels like dozens of photos does Jax finally release my wrists.





I stumble forward a couple steps, nearly losing my balance.





The second I'm free, I grab my bikini top that's still floating in the water and dive underwater as fast as I can.





Can't let any of them see me cry—I won't give them that satisfaction.





But underwater, I completely lose it—tears streaming down my face and mixing with the chlorinated pool water.





I'm struggling to get my top back on with shaking hands, biting my lip so hard I taste blood to keep from sobbing out loud.





Jax, you absolute piece of shit—I swear I'll make you pay for this humiliation a hundred times over.





By the time Coach White comes back to our section of the pool, everything looks completely normal again.





I made up an excuse about feeling sick and asked him for permission to leave.





Coach White looked at me, swaying like I was about to pass out any second, and asked worriedly what was wrong.





When Jax heard me say I wasn't feeling well, he let out this dismissive scoff.





""Coach, she's totally faking it.""





""I saw her running five miles this morning—how could she suddenly feel sick now?""





I bit my lip and turned to look at him.





He winked at me, his eyes full of challenge.





Sienna chimed in with fake concern. ""Vera, you can't just lie to get out of swim class.""





""That's really not cool.""





""Come on down, I'll practice with you.""





When I first signed up for electives, I'd planned to take dance.





But Jax secretly changed my elective to swimming—the same class he was in.





I can't swim. I'm actually kind of scared of water.





But he said, ""That's exactly why you need to learn!""





Later I found out the real reason—he wanted me to keep Sienna company.





After all, the swimming elective was full of guys, and Sienna was the only girl. He didn't want her getting harassed or groped.





To convince me to take swimming, he even bought me a swimsuit himself.





Back then I thought it was so sweet—my boyfriend personally teaching me how to swim.





Turns out that swimsuit would become the very tool he'd use to humiliate me.





Coach White looked between the three of us, then finally chose to believe me.





""If you're not feeling well, go rest. If something happens to you in the water, it could be serious.""





I thanked Coach White, and the second I walked out, I pulled out my phone and called the police.

I’m 27 and the youngest manager at my company that I started at 3 months ago. one of the girl in my crew is 23 and everything started professionally. I never saw her in that way and didn’t even try because I read all the stories here. One day we had to ride together and found out we both like the same things and grew up in the same area before moving to other cities. 

We started off texting through the company phones then switched to personal. Before that she has already shown interest in me by flirting. Now we’ll get coffee and some times lunch together but outside of work we have never hung out even though I have asked but she always says she’s busy. On her way home we’ll talk through the phone and before work. Then some times before she goes to bed and we’ll text no stop. 

She has never asked me to do anything for her from my role and I have never helped her in anyway or given her preference. The other day she asked me how I felt about her and I told her I thought she was cool and wanted to see where things go, her reply was “no comment” with laughing faces, I was like wait what the hell. 

I have analyzed the whole thing and I feel I fucked up. I feel now she was just using me for attention at work, and I feel stupid. at this point I don’t know how to end this and I should’ve been more professional cause of my role. I haven’t had a good night sleep in two days just thinking of how to end this, because the past couple days I’ve tried ignoring her she always calls me or texts me why I’m mad or what’s wrong.

My Suitcase lost a tooth

Between a rock and a hard place 
With a click in my jaw 
I’m steady on my feet 
And I’m quick on the draw

Four sheets to the wind 
Smashed as my left headlight 
My shadow wore my coat
and said it fit just right

Pack my Molotov cocktail 
Forget my lighter on the floor

Specs for: Ratnesh v26 (Beta Version, still updating via chai & overthinking)

Operating System:
lifeOS 26 — stable at times, but enters “brooding + romantic daydream mode” without warning.

Processor:
Dual-core “Procrastinator x Think-Too-Much” 2.0 GHz.
Runs great at night, slow AF in the morning. Boost clock activates only when someone cute texts… or when there’s a deadline.

RAM:
16GB DDR4 — smooth most days, but crashes when too many feelings or thoughts open at once.
Remembers tiny details about certain people, forgets why he stood up from the bed.

Storage:
128GB — but 90GB is memes, reels, and screenshots he’ll never use.
Secret folder reserved for flirty replies he might send one day.

GPU:
HumanRTX 2060 — decent at social interactions, but renders sarcasm in 4K without permission.
Struggles to render emotions before coffee… improves instantly after a cute compliment.

Audio System:
Stereo-ish. Clear voice but confidence-based volume control.
Goes mute during serious talks but becomes Dolby Atmos when flirting.

Ports:
USB-C for speed, but emotionally? Still USB 2.0 — takes a bit to open up.
Bluetooth works well, but disconnects for “mental peace”… unless he actually likes you.

Connectivity:
5G outdoors, but WiFi mentality indoors.
Connection drops instantly if asked, “Tell me what you’re really feeling.”

UI:
Smooth UI with occasional lag when someone flirts too directly.
Touchscreen highly responsive after trust update — extra responsive if teased.

Battery:
Lasts all day with snacks… but dies dramatically without warning.
Fast-charging boost near fridge or after a sweet message.

Security Features:
Overprotective firewall.
Blocks 97% of compliments… but melts instantly if the right person says it.
Accepts affection only from verified, good-vibe sources.",0,1764384183.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False

Total beginner here, just brew cold brew in a jar for the week, but recently trying flash frozen shots and using them for my protein shakes. Wanting to get a coffee pod machine purely for the convenience of it but also looking for it to taste good, not looking for perfection or cafe level good.

90% use case: shots for protein shakes and iced coffees.

Are the Nespresso machines that go 30-50k really worth it? If I could get something from the US what would you suggest? If not, looking to get something from Caramelly.

1p9di70,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p9di70/my_first_love_first_heartbreak/,my first love + first heartbreak,"My boyfriend (26M) of four years and I (25F) broke up two days ago, and I don’t even feel alive.

We’ve been together since we were 21. He’s my first love, my first relationship, and I’m his as well. I love him with my whole heart, and he’s always made sure I was loved too. We went on vacation recently, and I felt like something was “off.” When we got home, I asked if we could talk but not to break up, just to communicate how I was feeling.

A few days later, after a soccer game, he pulled over on the drive home and ended our relationship. He couldn’t even look at me. He was in tears the whole time. He said he loves me, but he feels like he can’t express love fully, not just with me, but with his family too and I completely agree with that feeling of his, I see it. He said he feels so loved by me, but that he can’t give me the love he thinks I deserve. He said something it never “fostered into what he thinks I should be receiving”. He says he is incapable of love, and is scared that he’ll be alone for the rest of his life.

He mentioned he’s depressed, but he never told me that until the breakup, he didn’t need to… I knew all along. He said he decided on Sunday when I said “we need to talk,” and spent days pretending everything was fine over text, but in reality he had 3 days to already cope with us breaking up.

We sat in the car for over three hours because he kept saying he was scared for when I got out, scared because he feels like we’ll never see each other again, scared because where do we go from here, what do we do now?

I never felt unloved by him. I always knew he loved me. Were there things I wished he did more of? Absolutely, but part of me loving him was understanding that he had different ways of showing his love than I did. I do think he struggled to get to a deeper emotional expression. He kept saying I deserved more. He asked me not to have hope, that he wants me to heal and not hope for a reconnection. He said he needs to figure out whether he’s even capable of love. 

I’m heartbroken and confused. I understand he’s struggling mentally, but it hurts that he thinks pushing me away is the best thing for me (Maybe in the long run, I’ll realize it is, but right now it absolutely isn’t, I loved our relationship). I want him to get help. I want him to try medication or therapy. I want him to see that he IS capable of love. But he’s convinced breaking up is protecting me. I was in his shoes at the beginning of the relationship, it’s almost like roles reversed, I was (finally) diagnosed with severe anxiety and he encouraged me to go on medication, I did and ever since then I feel like a new person, and I’ve opened up to him so much more and was able to fully love him.

I don’t have friends I can talk to about this. And I don’t just mean that like everyone says it, I actually don’t have a friend, nor do I have family to talk to because he never met my parents or came over. I don’t know how to get through the days. I feel like I lost him, his family, his friends, everything and worst of all I can’t be there to help him through this either. He said he’ll be there if I need him, and that maybe in the future, far down the road, we could be friends, I almost slapped him in his face, I don’t want to be friends. Right now I feel broken.

I guess I’m asking:
– Has anyone gone through something similar? On either ends?
– Does depression make people push away the person they love? Without realizing they do actually love them?
– How do I start healing when my entire world revolved around him? What do I do now?
– Do I reach out in 3-5 months time, and just ask to grab a coffee?

I am so incredibly pissed. It's bad enough that the pump broke after such a short time and such little use. And then this. Talk about insult to injury.

<Sci-Fi>  

***Black Gold***  

A wet *smack* echoed in the alley as Si took another punch to the jaw, the sound drowned by the rain. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth and she spat out a tooth.

“So,” Oscilla said, wiping the blood off of her badge, “what did we learn?”

“Pway mwoney by nexsht Fwiday,” Si muttered through swollen lips. 

Oscilla nodded at the two goons holding Si in place. They dropped her to to the alley floor. They followed Oscilla out to the street, her green hair glowing in the neon lights.

Si rolled over onto her back and let the rain wash the blood off of her face. She gently probed around the inside of her mouth with her tongue to see if any other teeth had come dislodged, but fortunately it was only the one.

*Count my fae-sworn blessings,* she thought. The wall helped her get the leverage needed to stand but found that her ankle was twisted. *When the fae did that happen?* Not that it mattered. *Fucking cops.*

Limping out to the sidewalk, Si wondered how the hell she’d get fifty-thousand in a week. Even if she sold every organ she didn’t need *and* could get out of post-op after all of that by then, she’d still be short.

Si struggled to navigate the crowded street, everyone else’s umbrellas seeming to aim water directly at her. Someone bumped her shoulder, her balance faltered and she put weight on her bad ankle. With a yelp of surprise and pain, she staggered sideways.

She smacked the wall and swore. Beside her, someone was entering the building and looked at her with a quizzical expression but continued on their way.

The door swung closed behind them and bounced open slightly, sending a waft of scented air at Si.

The scent of coffee. *Fresh* coffee. A plant that had gone extinct decades earlier and was now worth twice its weight in gold.

Someone in there had coffee, and Si had debts to pay.

She opened the door and stepped inside, looking around for the guy who’d just entered, but instead saw a room unlike anything she’d seen before.

No neon lights, or overhead lighting of any kind; just low-hanging lamps with soft orange bulbs, giving the spacious room a cozy feeling. Warm, earth colors everywhere with browns and greens, and almost every surface was coated with some sort of polished wood-looking material instead of chrome or plasteel.

""Wha' the hell ish dish pwace?"" she wondered aloud.

“Welcome to the Fun Tea Friday Cafe,” a tired woman in her forties with short, blue hair greeted tiredly, “where everyday is Friday.” She looked up from a retro model smartphone and the tired expression was suddenly stricken with concern.

“Holy shit, Si, what happened to you?”

“How j’you know mwy nyame?”

Now everyone in the… cafe?... looked at her.

“Merde!”

“Shit!”

“Oha!”

“Fae!”

A half-dozen people and people-shaped things got up from tables and booths and hurried over to her. 

""Everyone, calm down.” The older, blue-haired woman was no longer behind the register. “This is Si’s first time here, y’all know the protocol.”

Gentle enough that Si didn’t even realize it was happening, the woman guided her into a chair.

“But, Dee,” a large, hairy customer said, “look at the state she’s in?”

“Look at her hair, Remus; black, not pink. She’s probably terrified of you.”

Si tried to scowl. “Ahm not-”

“Here.” Dee handed her a small paper bag.

“Whash thish?” Si asked.

“Your lucky day,"" Dee said.

“Hey, Dee, we gotta-” a guy in a duster jacket began.

""I'm just following instructions."" Dee handed the guy a piece of paper.

Si looked in the bag and stopped breathing. Coffee beans. *Dozens* of them. *Hundreds*. While everyone was passing a note around, Si slowly got up and backed away from the table before limping as fast as she could outside.

She bumped into a woman opening the door.

""Woah, careful there,"" the woman said.

Si shoved past the pink-haired woman. She had enough in that paper bag to cover her debts and start a whole new life. She could even buy a TimeJump! Then she could come back and get more...

*""Look at her hair; black, not pink.""*

*""Woah, careful there,"" the woman said.""*

*Did she have pink hair?* Si turned and looked at the door. Hesitating - time paradoxes were *bad* news - she grabbed the door and opened it.

Inside was a lobby. No sign of a cafe at all.

Slim chance you’ll see this, but hey I once believed I could run 26.2 miles for “fun,” so clearly I make questionable bets.

I was out there suffering gloriously in the 2025 Boston Marathon.

You - a cute woman - shouted, “Go daddy, you got this!” near Boston College… at least I think it was Boston College. We briefly made eye contact and both smiled. 

I was deep in the Pain Dimension by then, so everything looked like a blurry combination of cheering students, discarded cups, and my own questionable life choices.

At that moment I was wrestling a monster blister and what I’m pretty sure was a toenail trying to quit its job. Morale was low. Dignity was gone. But your shout somehow made me smile and convinced my legs not to fall off.

I wanted to run back to you but:

	1.	I am shy.
	2.	I was very tempted.
	3.	I was also trying to finish under 3 hours (which, amazingly, I did).
	4.	Turning around mid-marathon would’ve raised some eyebrows and maybe a few medical flags.

If you see this, slide into my DMs. I’d love to buy you coffee or a proper meal - preferably one that doesn’t come in gel form.

Thanks for making a very painful day significantly better.

1p9d895,https://i.redd.it/w4xftbmrw34g1.jpeg,Bourbon Sidra from Candid Coffee [REVIEW],"Picked this up from Candid Coffee's Tandang Sora branch @ PHP 1,399 for 150g

Flavor notes are supposedly: **Honeydew, Muscat Grape, Tepache**

I was feeling like exploring flavors outside of the usual citrusy & floral notes I tend to lean towards, so I decided to grab it blind. For reference,

I used my usual recipe for trying out new beans:

14g coffee, 210g water @ 93c (my preference)  
88 clicks on the Kingrinder K7 (\\\~56-60 on the ZP6)

1. 45g bloom
2. Pour to 110g at 45 seconds.
3. Pour to 210g at 1 minute & 30 seconds.
4. 2:35 finish on the Hario Switch

**What I tasted:**

It started off very lime-y and quickly coated my tongue with this deeper acidity I'm not really used to. It had a ""sparkly"" finish I haven't really experienced before, but it could just be the acidity trying to shine through.

If I had to guess, this might be why \*\*""tepache""\*\* is in there as a flavor note & it does make sense. Other than that, nothing else really followed except a slightly bitter & smokey finish.

I think the best way to describe it is that it tasted like I'd just pulled a really acidic shot of espresso & stretched it out into an americano. If you've tasted Coffee Tonya's Brazil Bourbon, this tastes like a less bitter version of it while keeping the same level of acidity.

They're both omni roasts rin, so I might just suck at brewing omni roasts.

**Score: 6.5 / 10**

I'm sure this'll be great for people who appreciate a citrusy cup of coffee, but to put ""Honeydew, Muscat Grape,"" and ""Tepache"" as flavor notes when it tastes nothing even remotely close to it was just so disappointing for me. In hindsight, I probably should have tried bringing out the listed flavor notes by changing other brew parameters the 2nd time around, \*\*but I still think it doesn't live up to what it is trying to be.\*\*

\- a bit bigger. Not dad-bod yet, but definitely not skinny. Working on it  
\- generic white guy in appearance

\- Favorite color: Purple  
\- Favorite food: Nearest  
\- How's the weather: Nice and cold  
\- Dogs or cats: Unconditionally love every dog in existence. Neutral towards cats

I'm just a dude doing all a dude can do, really. Been single for... entirely too long. Anyway. I spend my free time listening to music and playing video games. What music? Mostly divorced dad rock, but my playlist has been described as musical whiplash before. What games? Simulators. Sometimes something else, but generally sims. What platform? PC. Yes we could probably play together.

Ideally, in person. Open to long distance, though.

Bad at small talk, even worse at talking about myself sometimes. I try, though

Year: 2025 
Typ: Business Class, Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (1-2-1 reverse-herringbone)
Booking: Award ticket — booked via miles and more Lufthansa 

I flew this right after a United Airlines Polaris business class flight (Boeing 777-300ER) and surprisingly — I liked Austrian much more. Here’s why.

⸻

Hard Product
Very modern seat & cabin: The 787-9 business-class cabin features 26 lie-flat “Super Diamond” seats in a 1-2-1 layout with direct aisle access. Great upgrade over older 767s or 777s.  

Privacy & comfort 
The reverse-herringbone layout and shell-style seats give you decent privacy, a good footwell, and a proper lie-flat bed. Storage compartments, power/USB outlets, and a large IFE screen make it convenient for long-haul.  

Excellent meals & service 
Austrian continues to impress with its catering (by DO & CO). The multi-course meal service (starter, soup, main, dessert/cheese, coffee) felt “restaurant-quality”, and the drink/coffee menu (including Viennese-style coffee) was a highlight. Service was friendly, attentive, and consistent.  

Good soft-product tone 
Crew was professional and welcoming; pre-flight drinks, attentive meal service, and general hospitality stood out.

The second weirdest thing about that week was the way Kevin stared at the walls.

The first weirdest thing was that nobody else seemed surprised.

It started after breakfast.

Kody had just finished digging the marshmallows out of Sheep’s cereal when Kevin came downstairs again, same hoodie, same hollow eyes, like he hadn’t slept at all.

He didn’t say good morning.

He walked straight past them, past the TV, past the shoes by the door, into the kitchen where Aunt Natalie was lining up jars like she was about to operate on them.

“Morning, Kevin,” she said, distracted, scribbling in her little green notebook. “There’s eggs on the—”

“Does this make sense to you?” he interrupted.

He slapped a handful of loose papers onto the counter. The pages were covered in symbols and numbers and curved lines that didn’t sit straight on the page, like the ink didn’t want to stay still.

Kody scooted closer on the couch, craning his neck to see.

Natalie blinked, wiped her hands on a towel, and picked up the top sheet.

“Is this… math?” she asked.

“It’s not math,” Kevin said. His voice had that stretched-thin sound, like a balloon about to pop. “Math is just how we pretend to understand it.”

Natalie tried to follow the lines with her finger. There were spirals, half-finished equations, arrows to nowhere. Circles with words in them.

TIME (NOT LINEAR)

SOUL = RECURSION

HEAVEN != UP

Under one diagram, Kody squinted and read:
“The world is held together by an error.”

Natalie forced a little laugh. “You’ve been studying too hard.”

“It folds here,” Kevin said, jabbing at a spot on the page. “Right here. Time doesn’t move, it loops. We just don’t notice because we’re inside the curl.”

“I—”

“And if this part is wrong,” he pushed another paper toward her, “then consciousness shouldn’t even be stable. People shouldn’t be able to stay… people. We should all be falling apart. Constantly. Like—” He moved his hands in and out, like something glitching.

Natalie’s face had gone pale, but her voice stayed calm in that fake adult way. “Kevin, slow down. One sentence at a time.”

“I don’t have time to slow down,” he snapped. “It’s already leaking.”

Leaking.

The word stuck in Kody’s brain like gum.

“Leaking what?” Natalie whispered.

Kevin looked up at her then, really looked, and for a second Kody thought he saw fear in her eyes — real fear, not the “oh no, you got a C-minus” kind.

“Reality,” Kevin said softly. “What else?”

He grabbed the papers back, shoved them into a messy stack, and walked out of the kitchen without another word.

Natalie stared after him, lips pressed together, knuckles white around the towel.

She didn’t notice Kody and Sheep watching from the couch.

An hour later, Mel came home from somewhere. She always came home from somewhere — grocery store, church thing, volunteering, “helping a friend.” She was one of those adults who existed in permanent good-deed mode.

She kicked off her shoes by the door and floated into the living room with a bright, “Hey, boys,” and then, louder: “Kevin? You here?”

Kevin walked out of the hallway like he’d been summoned.

He stopped when he saw her.

Stopped completely.

If someone had hit pause on a remote, he wouldn’t have looked more frozen.

Mel smiled at him, soft and warm. “Hey, honey. You okay?”

He stared.

His eyes… changed.

Not color. Just focus. Like he was seeing through her instead of at her.

“Hope,” he whispered.

Mel blinked. “What?”

“Why are you in this house?” His voice shook. “Why are you here?”

Kody sat up straighter.

Sheep pressed closer to him, thumb halfway to his mouth before he remembered he was “too old” for that and dropped his hand.

Mel laughed nervously. “Uh, because I live here?”

“You don’t,” Kevin said. “Not really.”

The air in the room felt heavier.

Kody didn’t know what that meant, but he knew he didn’t like it.

Kevin took a step back like she was radioactive. “Hope isn’t supposed to be in this house.”

“Okay, Kevin,” she said, still doing the gentle voice, but her heartbeat was visible in her neck now. “You’re scaring the kids.”

He looked at Kody and Sheep like he’d forgotten they existed, then winced, like remembering hurt.

“Right,” he muttered. “Right. Kids.”

He turned away, fingers digging into his hair, and disappeared into the hallway.

Mel stood there for a few seconds, not moving, not breathing, eyes fixed on the space he’d just left.

Then she blinked hard, swallowed whatever expression was trying to climb out of her, and turned back to them with a too-bright smile.

“Who wants grilled cheese for lunch?” she asked.

Sheep raised his hand automatically.

Kody didn’t answer.

He just watched the doorway where Kevin had vanished and wondered since when emotions had names like “Hope” and rules about which houses they were allowed in.

The sounds started in the afternoon.

Kody and Sheep were in their room, pretending to do homework and actually stacking cards into collapsing towers, when they heard it.

The clack.

The steady, frantic clackclackclack of computer keys being abused.

“Dad’s typing weird,” Sheep said.

“That’s not Dad,” Kody said. Gordon typed slow, thoughtful, like he was punching guilt into every email. This sound was too fast. Too alive. Too desperate.

They crept down the hallway.

Gordon’s office door was open just enough for them to peek.

Kevin sat in his chair, hunched over the keyboard, eyes locked on the screen. His fingers blurred. Kody had never seen anyone type like that. No pauses. No errors. No looking down.

The monitor was full of symbols. Not English. Not code Kody recognized from the few times he’d watched Kevin write website stuff. This looked like someone had smashed math and poetry and programming together and dared it to make sense.

Lines that read like:

IF soul >= fracture THEN duplicate(memory)

and

VAR mercy = false;

and

FUNCTION door(open) { return ALL_TIMELINES; }

The printer whirred to life beside him.

Pages rolled out, one after another, after another, building a white skyscraper on the tray.

Kody counted under his breath.

Ten.
Twenty.
Thirty.

He lost track somewhere around fifty.

Sheep tugged his sleeve. “We’re gonna get in trouble.”

Kody didn’t answer.

He couldn’t look away.

Kevin never blinked.

Finally, the printer stopped. The room hummed with the ghost of its noise.

Kevin stood, scooped up the stack of papers — thick as a phone book — and held it like something fragile and dangerous at the same time.

“It’s leaking,” he whispered to himself. “Maybe he can still patch it.”

He turned toward the door.

Kody yanked back so fast he smacked into Sheep and they both fell into their bedroom doorway just in time to pretend they were Very Busy Not Eavesdropping.

Kevin walked past them without looking, down the hall, through the back door.

Kody scrambled to the window and lifted the blinds a fraction.

Outside, Kevin crossed the yard to Grandpa Ervin’s shed.

Ervin opened the door before Kevin could knock, like he’d been waiting.

They spoke.

Kody couldn’t hear the words, just saw Kevin thrust the stack of pages into Ervin’s hands. The old man’s face drained of color as he flipped through them.

Kevin said something, sharp and short.

Ervin nodded once, jaw tight, and pulled him into the shed, closing the door behind them.

Kody let the blinds drop.

“What was that?” Sheep whispered.

“I don’t know,” Kody said.

But he knew what it wasn’t.

Normal.

It was almost dark when Kevin finally came to their room.

Kody and Sheep were mid-argument about whether video game bosses counted as “real evil” or “fake evil that didn’t matter” when the door pushed open without a knock.

Kevin filled the doorway like a storm cloud.

His eyes were rimmed red, but not from crying. From lack of blinking.

He walked in and sat on the floor between their beds, cross-legged, like he used to when they were younger and he’d tell them ghost stories and then swear they weren’t real.

“Come here,” he said.

That was already wrong. He never used that tone with them. Too serious. Too old.

Sheep slid off his bed first and sat in front of him. Kody followed, slower.

Kevin put a hand on each of their shoulders.

His grip was too tight.

“Listen to me,” he said. “And don’t interrupt. Okay?”

They both nodded.

He took a breath like he was about to dive underwater.

“Heaven is not what people think,” he said. “You need to know that.”

Kody frowned. “What do you—”

“Don’t interrupt,” Kevin repeated, sharper.

Kody shut up.

“Heaven is not up. It’s not clouds or harps or a reward. It’s… not where most people go.” His fingers dug a little deeper into their shoulders. “Because most people don’t go anywhere.”

Sheep’s mouth fell open a little. “What do they do?”

“They stay,” Kevin said. “Here. Over and over and over. This place doesn’t end when you die. It just shuffles you. New name. New body. Same cage. Same… rules.”

Kody’s chest felt tight. “You mean—reincarnation?”

“Sort of.” He made a face like the word tasted wrong. “It’s more like respawning in a game you never chose to play. And every time you think you found the exit, it’s just another level of the same map.”

“That’s Hell?” Sheep whispered.

Kevin looked at him, surprised.

“Yes,” he said quietly. “This is Hell.”

A silence hit the room like something physical.

Cars passed outside. A dog barked down the street. The house made its usual settling noises.

None of it sounded the same anymore.

“The world is out of sync,” Kevin continued. “Something ancient is waking up through the cracks. The rules are going to change. People like… us get caught in the middle when that happens.”

“People like us?” Kody echoed, very softly.

Kevin’s jaw tensed. “I don’t have time to explain that yet. Just—just remember this: if something happens to me, it’s not because I disappeared. It’s because they took me. Or because I left on purpose.”

“Who’s ‘they’?” Sheep asked.

Kevin hesitated.

For the first time that day, he looked scared.

“Everyone,” he said. “And no one. It’s… not important now. What’s important is that you pay attention. To what people say. To what they don’t say. To what feels wrong even when everyone pretends it’s fine.”

His fingers loosened on their shoulders.

He looked suddenly exhausted.

“I’m sorry,” he murmured. “You’re too young. I shouldn’t be putting this on you.”

“Then don’t,” Kody said, the words slipping out before he could stop them. “Just… get help. Or sleep. Or something. You’re freaking us out.”

Kevin gave a small, broken laugh.

“I tried getting help,” he said. “They gave me pills and fluorescent lights and called it a day.”

He stood up, rubbing his face with both hands.

“I don’t have much time before they drag me back there again,” he muttered. “I just wanted you to know it’s not… all in my head.”

He left before they could ask what “there” meant.

He didn’t make it through the night.

Not really.

The shouting started sometime around midnight.

Kody woke up to Gordon’s voice, low and angry, and Mel’s, higher and shaking. He couldn’t make out words, just the sharp edges of them.

Then a different voice. Deeper. Familiar in a not-family way.

Mr. Alvarez.

He lived two streets over. He’d known Kevin since he was a kid. He was one of those adults who didn’t talk down to teenagers, which automatically made him suspicious and trustworthy at the same time.

Kody slid out of bed and crept to the top of the stairs. Sheep followed, silent as a shadow.

Down in the living room, Kevin paced in circles, hands in his hair, eyes too wide.

“I’m not crazy,” he was saying. “I’m not, I’m not, I’m not—”

“We know, son,” Gordon said, in a tone that meant he didn’t believe that at all.

“There’s something wrong with the world, not with me,” Kevin insisted. “Everything that’s happening is—”

“Kev.” Mr. Alvarez stepped in front of him, palms up. “Listen, man. I’ve been where you are. Remember? When I was your age? I thought everything was a sign. I thought numbers were messages. I thought the radio was talking to me.”

“It is talking to you,” Kevin snapped. “To all of us. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.”

“I also thought that,” Mr. Alvarez said calmly. “And you know what helped?”

Kevin glared.

“Letting some people who aren’t inside my head look around in there to make sure nothing’s broken.”

“I don’t have time for them to call my brain broken just because it’s faster than theirs,” Kevin said.

Mel wiped at her eyes. “Kevin, please. Just… just let them help. For me.”

He flinched at that.

“Hope,” he whispered again, like the word hurt. “Don’t ask me to go back there.”

“We’re not asking,” Gordon said. “You’re scaring your brothers. You’re scaring everyone. This isn’t up for debate.”

The word “brothers” hit Kody like a physical thing.

They were talking about him.

This was about him.

Mr. Alvarez put a hand on Kevin’s shoulder. “Ride with me. We’ll talk on the way. Nobody’s gonna lock you up. They just want to help you sleep. Get some distance from… all this.”

All this.

Kevin sagged, shoulders dropping like the strings holding him up had been cut.

“Fine,” he muttered. “But if they try to shut it down again, it’s going to break worse.”

Nobody answered that.

They walked him to the door like he was being escorted to a bus he didn’t want to get on.

Kody pressed his back against the wall, heart pounding.

Kevin looked up the stairs as he passed.

For one second, their eyes met.

And Kody could’ve sworn — sworn — that his brother saw him there in the shadows and chose not to say anything.

Then the door opened.

Cold air rushed in.

Footsteps. A car door. An engine.

Silence.

The next time they saw Kevin, he was… smaller.

He came back three days later.

No hoodie. Just a plain T-shirt and hospital bracelet dangling from his wrist like a tag.

His eyes were heavy-lidded, unfocused. His speech came out thick, like he was chewing it.

Mel fussed over him. Gordon took the discharge papers. Natalie hovered in the doorway, watching like she was examining cracks in a wall.

“Hey, boys,” Kevin said.

The voice was his, but something was missing behind it. The sharpness. The too-muchness.

Kody felt relieved for exactly half a second.

Then he saw the way Kevin’s hand shook when he reached for a glass of water, and the relief turned into something else.

“Are you okay?” Sheep asked bluntly.

“Yeah, little man,” Kevin said. His smile didn’t reach his eyes. “They just gave me some stuff to help my brain chill out.”

“Do you still see… leaking?” Sheep asked.

Kody kicked him under the table.

Kevin stared at his little brother for a long moment.

Then he sighed.

“Nah,” he lied. “All patched up.”

Weeks blurred after that.

Kevin slept a lot.

When he was awake, he moved slow, like someone had filled his limbs with wet sand. He watched TV without reacting. He sat at the table during meals but barely ate.

Gordon said the medication needed time.

Mel said healing wasn’t linear.

Natalie said nothing, just wrote more in her notebook.

Kody tried to pretend things were getting better.

But sometimes he’d catch Kevin staring at a corner of the room like it was bending.

Or watching Mel with that same too-knowing expression.

Or twitching when the printer made a noise, even if it was off.

And once, late at night, Kody passed his brother’s door on the way to the bathroom and heard him whispering:

“It’s still leaking. They just dimmed the lights.”

The morning Kevin disappeared was a Wednesday.

Kody remembered because he hated Wednesdays. They were too far from the weekend on both sides.

He woke up to the smell of burnt toast and the sound of Gordon swearing at the toaster. Normal.

Sheep drooled on his pillow. Normal.

Birds outside shrieked like they were auditioning for a horror movie. Normal for their neighborhood.

Kody rolled out of bed and pulled on the same jeans from the day before. He padded down the hall, rubbing sleep out of his eyes, and paused outside Kevin’s door.

He always checked now.

Just to make sure he was still there.

He knocked lightly.

“Kev? You awake?”

No answer.

That wasn’t unusual. Heavy meds. Heavy sleep.

Kody hesitated, then turned the knob.

The door opened.

The room felt wrong the second he stepped in.

Not messy-wrong. Kevin’s room was always messy. Clothes, books, scribbled notes everywhere.

This was… quiet-wrong.

Air-wrong.

The curtains were half-open, letting in a thin gray light. The bed was unmade. The blanket thrown back like someone had gotten up and forgotten to fix it.

The window was closed.

The window was locked.

Kevin’s shoes sat by the wall.

His wallet was on the dresser.

His phone lay on the nightstand, plugged in, fully charged, with yesterday’s date still glowing on the screen.

“Kevin?” Kody said, louder.

Nothing.

He checked the closet. Bathroom. Under the bed, even though that was stupid.

Empty.

His stomach did a slow, cold flip.

He walked around the room again, slower, looking for anything that said where Kevin had gone.

There was nothing.

No packed bag.

No open window.

No note.

Just… an absence. Like someone had cut Kevin out of the scene with scissors and left the outline of his life behind.

Sheep appeared in the doorway, hair a fluffy mess. “He not up?”

“He’s not here,” Kody said.

Sheep shrugged. “Maybe he’s with Grandpa.”

“His shoes are here. His phone is here. His wallet is here.”

“So?” Sheep said.

“So where would he go without his shoes, his phone, or his money?” Kody snapped.

Sheep’s face scrunched. “…Bathroom?”

“He’s not in the bathroom,” Kody said.

They stared at each other.

For the first time since the exorcism, Kody saw real fear in his little brother’s eyes.

They went downstairs together.

Mel was at the stove, poking dead toast with a spatula. Gordon sat at the table with his coffee, reading the news on his phone. Natalie flipped through her notebook. Ervin hadn’t come in from the shed yet.

“Where’s Kevin?” Kody asked.

Four adult heads lifted at once.

“What do you mean?” Mel said.

“He’s not in his room,” Kody said. “Like… at all.”

Gordon frowned. “Did you check the bathroom?”

“Yes,” Kody said.

“Closet?” Natalie asked.

“Yes.”

“Outside?” Mel suggested weakly.

“His shoes are in his room,” Kody said. “His phone. His wallet.”

The word hung there between them like a dropped glass.

Something cracked behind Gordon’s eyes.

Mel’s hand flew to her mouth.

Natalie stood so fast her chair tipped.

Kody watched all of them react — not with confusion, not with “oh maybe he went for a walk” — but with a kind of quiet, horrified understanding.

Like this was the exact thing they’d been waiting to happen.

Like a countdown had just hit zero.

“He didn’t go anywhere,” Kody said, voice shaking. “He’s just… gone.”

No one corrected him.

No one said that was impossible.

No one told him he was overreacting.

And that was how Kody knew, deep down in the part of him that stored all the stuff adults never confirmed:

Whatever had been leaking had finally broken through.

And it had taken his brother with it.

Apologies if this isn't the correct sub. Will very much appreciate your inputs.

I had an internal sliding door moved (basically moved aside from one end to the other end on the same wall) in an unfurnished apartment. Got several quotes with similar pricing around $3500 and same timeline, that the job will take 3 days.

I decided to go with this guy who said just moved down to Melbourne and restarting his business. He got business name, ABN, and insurance, but my mistake for not asking to check his licences.
Prior to my decision, he gave pretty good first impressions when he inspected the site. Sounds easy to deal with and reasonable. He made notes and scribbles on a template form he created and then sent a detailed quote with work timeline.
I paid deposit of 30% before work starts and then 25% as progress after first day ends. He emailed a progress report as well.

I asked if the wall had insulation prior it was torn down, he said it didn't. On day 2 he offered to install insulation into the wall and I aggreed $200 to do that.

He worked on this project with one other guy and 3 days passed (Wednesday to Friday) and the job hasn't finished for whatever reason. I think he said it was more complicated than he thought.
He asked to work over the weekend, which is against strata rules but he tried to make it happen anyway, (I'm sorry my neighbours). He worked Saturday and Sunday, and hasn't finished.
I had another project slated and booked for the apartment, so that had to go through first on the following Monday to Wednesday. And I did mention this to him prior.
Then he came back to work on Thursday and Friday, afterwards still have some finishing need to be done.
Some outstanding items:
- A skirting board hasn't been installed
- A skirting board was probably cut too short and joined, but the joint is immediately visible
- Uneven paintings
- Carpet was cut too short

He asked for full payment, that I said I can't. I'm more than happy to provide progress payment, but not full payment until all the above items are addressed.
He claimed that he has completed the project 100% and these items are rectification.
Said he's losing money because the project got extended for so long. When asked why it got prolonged, he said due to unforeseen circumstances. Like what? And he can't answer that. Then blames the insulation installation. I said you offered it and you didn't mention any timeline extension at the time.
He demanded payment again and I said no.

He took a hammer and said he's going to smash the walls. So either I pay up or the hammer goes into the wall. This is his work and because I haven't paid in full, he's free to do whatever he wants with it.
I just stayed silent, then he proceeds to pack up and go home.
Afterwards he sent a text asking about the payment.

What should I do? 
At this stage, does the project considered complete? 
I feel I have been trying to be as reasonable and accommodating as possible. I put in a small fridge in the apartment and stock it with bottled water and coke. I bought lunch and coffee twice for them.
For most part I think he did good and he cleans up pretty well.
But I'm also worried about my personal safety.
I no longer want him to come back to the site. Should I send a notice that I don't feel safe and barring him to attend the premises?
I don't mind cutting losses (i.e pay him in full just to complete my obligation) and move on.
Thank you.",34,1764382712.0,AusRenovation,20,0.9,False

I’m really hoping vets or people with experience can help me understand what is happening with my dog and what the kindest next step is. I feel completely lost and heartbroken.

Background:
About a week ago, I brought my dog(3 years old male) to the vet and he was confined for four days. He had a catheter placed and was on multiple medications. The vets recommended surgery, but we couldn’t afford to continue the confinement or the surgical costs. Even though it wasn’t advised for him to be discharged yet, we had no choice but to take him home on Day 4.

At home, we tried our best to continue his care. We fed him the prescribed urinary diet and gave some of the medications, but not all, because we couldn’t afford everything that was prescribed. We were really hoping he would stabilize, but things have gotten worse.


His symptoms now:
- Pale gums
- Straining to pee only a drop or two comes out no matter how hard he tries
- Can still walk to his water bowl, but is extremely tired and mostly sleeps
- Drinks water frequently, but his body doesn’t seem to tolerate it
- Vomiting different types: (undigested food, clear water, foamy, yellow, brown, dark coffee-colored liquid (which I’ve read can be blood) and earlier he had wheezing during the last part of vomiting
- Barely eating, last night he ate a little, then today only about 5cc and even that tiny amount comes back up
- Seems alert but exhausted and avoids eye contact
- Breathing a bit fast like in out motion
- Any food or water seems to upset him
- He’s still trying to pee and drink, but his body clearly can’t handle much

What I feel right now is that I feel like we’ve done a lot already took out loans for his emergency confinement, meds, catheter, prescription diet, home care but at the same time, I feel like it wasn’t enough and that I should have done more. I’m heartbroken and confused because I can see his body is giving up. Even tiny amounts of food or water don’t stay down.

I’m also struggling because he seems to be telling me he’s tired, but I don’t know if I should let him pass naturally beside me or take him for euthanasia.

My concerns about the decision:

If I let him pass at home, I know he’ll be beside me, in a familiar place, without the stress of travel or strangers.
But euthanasia might prevent suffering. I just worry the clinic environment and new people will stress him out in his last moments.

I also don’t know if his condition is still treatable at all. At this point, he can’t tolerate food, vomits different substances, can’t pee properly, and his gums are pale.

My questions:
1. Based on these symptoms, is his passing likely very close (hours to a day)?
2. Does this sound like active organ failure that cannot be reversed without intensive vet care?
3. Would letting him die naturally at home likely be painful or distressing?
4. Or is euthanasia the kinder, more humane choice at this stage?
5. Do dogs in their final hours still get up and walk around a little, like how he still walks to drink before lying down again?

I don’t want him to suffer. I just want to make the right choice for him. Any guidance, especially from vets, would mean a lot. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.",3,1764382681.0,DogAdvice,5,1.0,False

1p9d112,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9d112,"Trip Report for Hong Kong, 4-night stay.","Trip Report for Hong Kong.

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August – 19th September 2025.

My travel route was Beijing – Luoyang – Dengfeng – Kaifeng – Chongqing – Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – Furong – Fenghuang – Wangxiangu – Hengdian Film Studios – Shanghai – HK.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**HONG KONG = 4 nights** and this was my 6th time to HK – I will return again and again!

I flew with Cathay Pacific from 9:30am Shanghai to 12:30pm HK for $158 AUD (which includes a second 23kg checked baggage piece – extra cost) and I booked directly on their website. After collecting my suitcase & duffle bag, **I picked up my Octopus card at the airport (pre-booked via Klook) and used the Airport Express Train (also pre-booked via Klook, return trip) to get to Hong Kong metro station.** From here, I caught a local double-decker bus to my hotel = THE ARCA, 4 nights for $472 AUD, booked via Expedia so I could use some points to reduce the cost, otherwise it would have been $627 AUD.

**HOTEL: The Arca is a really nice, modern hotel and less than 10min walk to Wong Chuk Hang metro station (on the South Island line – lime green color, close to Ocean Park).** I chose the Sea Signature Room which was huge = 30 sqm and has a king bed, TV, bathroom with stand-up shower stand, western sit-down toilet, mini fridge, coffee machine with daily refills of coffee pods, tea, sugar etc. Water is available on each floor from a special machine where you can select hot, warm or cold, and fill up your water bottle or use the jug provided in the room. The main reason why I chose this hotel is for the harbour view (see first photo attached). By the time that I checked into my hotel, it was 3pm. I explored the hotel and had a look at the rooftop pool (great views & is used by guests – I rarely see anyone in a hotel pool when I check, see 2nd photo attached) then took a 10min walk to the **Southside mall that’s connected to Wong Chuk Hang metro station** for a late lunch, shopped around and stocked up on drinks / snacks for the next few days. Dinner was takeaway and back at the hotel since I was buggered and wanted to enjoy my lovely room!

**NOTE: HK hotels are expensive so if you’re willing to stay out of the city centre and tourist attraction areas (like Central – Causeway Bay – Tsim Sha Tsui – Mongkok), you will get better value for your money... like a bigger room, more amenities and better facilities. Ideally, find a place that’s close to a metro station and bus stop so you have some transportation options. I believe the metro trains and buses stop running by 11pm, depending where you are and where you’re going to? I haven’t used a HK taxi before so I don’t know how much it costs but I’m assuming, its expensive...**

**HK E-SIM:** I used this one for HK from Trip.com https://au.trip.com/things-to-do/detail/57498874
**For 4 nights / 5 days, I used less than 3GB and only paid $2.88 AUD because I had some Trip.com points that I could redeem! Dirt cheap!!! If you’re only using data to navigate around HK, research opening / closing times for attractions, places to eat, you won’t need much data.** I have Nord VPN on my mobile phone and I turned it off during my stay to avoid any issues. I was able to access social media apps and communication apps like Whatsapp, FB Messenger, Viber, and checked my hotmail emails, google search stuff with this e-Sim so I highly recommend it. I will happily use it again! I don’t use TikTok so I don’t know if it will work with this eSim.

**CHINA E-SIM:** I forgot to mention which eSim that I used for China in my Trip Report, so here it is = I used this one for CHINA from Trip.com https://au.trip.com/things-to-do/detail/57501862 and its currently listed as **China Mainland 5G/4G eSIM | DayPass / Total | 500MB/day - Total 30GB | 1-30 Days | 24-Hour Billing | QR Code**. ** I travelled around China for 30 days and used roughly 22GB. So this 30-day / 30GB eSim for $24 AUD was more than enough for me. As long as you don’t you-tube, netflix, stream videos, you won’t need a lot of data. I thought Alipay and WeChat would take up a lot more data but it didn’t. I only opened the apps when I needed to pay for something, text the hotel or text people. I was able to access social media apps and communication apps like Whatsapp, FB Messenger, Viber, and checked my hotmail emails, google search stuff with this e-Sim so I highly recommend it. I will happily use it again! I don’t use TikTok so I don’t know if it will work with this eSim.

**HK TRANSPORTATION:** Definitely get an **Octopus Card and top-up with cash at the metro stations.** I topped up 50 HKD, several times, during my 4-night stay. **HK metro and bus rides are about the same price as Sydney, Australia**, its not cheap like China (aw, man!). Each time you ride the metro (see photo 3 to 6 attached) or bus (see photo 8 attached), depending on the distance, you’re looking at least 10 HKD, one way. A few times, I paid around 30 HKD for a 45min bus ride. **I recommend trying the bus to get around HK (not just the metro train) so you can enjoy a more scenic route (views out the window, see photo 7 attached).** Use **Google Maps** to figure out your way around. **If you want to use some bus apps to plan ahead – see schedules / route options, download: APP 1933 – KMB / LWB or hkbus.app – HK BUS ETA and install before you arrive into HK (to avoid or minimise issues accessing their apps).** 

**PAYING FOR STUFF IN HK**: HK has their own **HK Alipay app** and (from my understanding) you need a Chinese / Taiwanese / HK mobile phone number to register. But, not to worry! If you have the **China Alipay app** you should still be able to pay for some things – I did! **Just ask the vendor or shop staff if you can and I negotiated the price (depending on current exchange rate with HKD, RMB and you’re home country to get the best value).** It worked just fine, as if I was back in China! I’m assuming, many places in HK have the China Alipay app as a payment option as they do get lots of visitors from the mainland… so don’t be shy, ask!!!

Other options to pay is via **Google Pay** (tap your mobile phone away!), you can use the **Octopus Card** (to pay for stuff at certain stores, restaurants and cafes) or **you scan the QR code, fill out your details and credit card information to pay** (I did this once on the day that I arrived for late lunch at a restaurant). **Some vendors at Ladies Markets and other street stalls around HK do prefer cash, so it’s definitely a good idea to have a bit with you and especially small notes.**

**ATTRACTIONS:** Here’s a list and review of the places that I visited on this trip to HK...

**HK Heritage Museum with Bruce Lee and Jin Yong exhibitions**: this is a bit far from the city centre but its 5min walk to a metro station and its **free entry**. I spent less than 3hrs wondering around in here (but you could easily spend 4hrs+ if you have kids), checking out all the halls which included the usual traditional art, Buddhism sculptures, ceramics, antiques, etc. The best exhibitions are Bruce Lee and Jin Yong as its most unique. **You can take photos everywhere in this museum but not in the Bruce Lee exhibition so don’t travel all the way here if you want to take photos in the Bruce Lee exhibition – cause you can’t and there’s cameras / staff monitoring.** I was sad that I couldn’t but its an incredible exhibition about his life – not just the movies (outfits, props, are on display), information about his martial arts academy, family, etc with photos, videos, etc. I found **the Cantonese Opera exhibit (similar to Sichuan Opera)** also very interesting and **the HK film, TV & music industry section** awesome (lots of video clips to watch – cast & crew interviews, costumes, posters, memorabilia stuff) and there’s a children’s section that I didn’t visit... I was really hungry by then, so I left and had lunch at the cafe (connected on the ground floor) which is a really popular spot (busy, crowded)... they serve western food, good value/price/serving (you will be full!).

**HK Museum of Art**: this **free-entry** museum is right next to Avenue of Stars so you get a wonderful harbour view from above. There’s quite a bit to see, if you wander into each hall, so allocated 2hrs+. It has a mixture of modern and traditional art like calligraphy, floral paintings, etc. **Near one of the windows overlooking the harbour view, there’s a few tablets on tables where you can fill out a 5min questionnaire to find out what traditional Chinese career you could have had with your personality / character** – I thought that was cool! I did the questionnaire twice and both times it said I would have been a Scholar – Official! There’s also a very impressive exhibition called **Art of Gifting: The Fuyun Xuan Collection of Chinese Snuff Bottles and it was one of the best that I have ever seen!** I highly recommend visiting this hall as it had over 100+ snuff bottles for to you admire – the detailed artwork, the craftsmanship, the designs, patterns, colours, shapes and sizes are really beautiful and fascinating. How people made these miniatures, without the technology and equipment that we have today, is really incredible.

**Avenue of Stars**: Now, if you visit Hong Kong and don’t come here, then you really didn’t visit Hong Kong (see photo 18 to 20 attached). **This is the place to see the harbour view, especially at night when its all lit up! During the day time, you can walk along this promenade and check-out all the hand-prints (like Hollywood’s Walk of Fame) of Chinese internationally-known celebrities like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh to more Asia-recognised celebrities like Andy Lau, Leon Lai, Aaron Kwok, Tony Leung, Jacky Cheung, Cecilia Cheung, James Wong, Stephen Chow, Sammo Hung, etc.** What I found disappointing about this attraction is that the hand-prints are placed on the hand railings that face the harbour view so its difficult to take photos with and from eye level: you have to hold your camera / mobile higher up and take the shot looking down. The last time that I visit the Avenue of Stars was in 2017 and the hand-prints were on the ground so you could walk around them, sit next to one and take a photo with them = like how the Hollywood Walk of Fame is. Anyways, while you are here, if you can, walk the full length (will take you less than 20min if you don’t stop to take photos?) and take a photo with the **Bruce Lee statue** which is located near some restaurants and cafes towards a ferry boarding dock / pier.

**K11 Musea Mall**: This is a high-end brand shopping mall. Its right next the Avenue of Stars. I didn’t buy anything here but its **a great stop for the toilet, some much needed air-con and lunch in the food court**.

**Harbour City Mall**: On the left-side of **Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier** and next to the Marco Polo HK Hotel, is the popular Harbour City Mall. It has a mixture of high-end brands, local brands, restaurants and cafes etc. Many tourists / foreigners visit here. I came for the toilet and to visit the Popmart store haha

**Tsim Sha Tsui area**: If you like walking around, I recommend exploring this area by foot. Besides the places mentioned above, I suggest to walk through streets like **Middle Road, Hankow Road, Peking Road, Ashley Road, Minden Row, Mody Road, Carnanvon Road**, as there are some good HK souvenir shops, lots of malls like Isquare and K11 Art Mall, plus the infamous **Chungking Mansions on Nathan Road**. I always wander around this area and find lots of things at buy at great prices but you do need time to browse and of course it depends on what you want to buy. **Its a tradition for me take the 45min walk from Mongkok Ladies Market (see photo 10 attached), down Nathan Road and check-out the shops along the way, to the Avenue of Stars. This walk helps me see the changes in HK and I detour off the main road to places like Temple Street Night Market (see photo 11 attached) which is located closer to Jordan metro station.**

**In between Yau Ma Tei & Jordan metro stations**: other notable attractions are **HK Avenue of Comic Stars** (I haven’t visited properly, I’ve only seen and stopped to take photos with the **two staircases that lead to the attraction from Nathan Road (see photo 16 attached)**, **Kowloon Park**, **Yau Ma Tei Jade Hawker Bazaar** (I visited years ago and didn’t buy anything, best to go only if you know jade prices and quality really well)… I like the souvenir shops along **Park Lane Shopper’s Boulevard**, and there’s **Mira Place Shopping Mall and The One Shopping Mall** nearby, if you have time.

**Mongkok**: is worth visiting and not just for shopping but for the food too. I’ve walk down **Sai Yuen Choi Street for electronic goods, Tung Choi Street / Ladies Market, Fa Yuen Street for sporting goods & footwear** many times. It’s not all cheap so know your brand and prices, focus on what you want or need to buy, otherwise, you will probably waste money and need another suitcase to lug it all back home! **I bought a bunch of nylon foldable tote bags for around 10 HKD each (price will vary depending on size, design and vendor) at the Ladies Markets, with HK retro art pictures, Pokemon characters, Hello Kitty, Snoopy designs etc. I think these were the cheapest items that I got on this HK trip. They’re very handy to have to carry your shopping, snacks and drinks whilst travelling, plus they make great gifts as they’re lightweight and don’t take up much space in your suitcase.**

In regards to food in Mongkok, I recommend eating at any of the popular busy restaurants and cafes – there’s so many places packed with people and a wide variety of cuisines, I don’t think you can go wrong with any of them. I know you can’t always assume the quality of food is better if its a crowded eatery but it does indicate its a decent place otherwise it would have closed down already? As you should know, real estate / rent is not cheap in HK, so for any business to be crowded, has queues or crowds, than it has to be good. Check google reviews, if needed, to confirm and decide...

**Causeway Bay**: I visited this area for shopping. You could spend a whole day just walking from street to mall here… I visited **Times Square, Percival Street, Jardin Bazaar Crescent, Don Don Donki aka Don Quixote Japanese store (to see what they stock compared to Japan stores = same but there’s more variety in the Japan stores), Sogo Department, Causeway Bay Plaza, Fashion Walk, Windsor House** in half a day. I mainly focused on buying cute cartoon stuff except for **Decathlon** where I bought a pair of casual sportswear type shoes.

**Central**: Every time time I visit HK, I explore this area and see many changes. The streets that I always visit are **Li Yuen Street, Fa Yuen Street, Pottinger Street (see photo 17 attached), Peddler Street and I wander around the entry of the Central-Mid-Level Escalators**. I’ve been on these escalators before, years ago. This **Soho** area is also nice to visit and its popular hang out at night for the cafes, bars etc. There’s the famous **ICF Mall which is connected to the HK metro station** and I really enjoyed walking through **Central Market** which is like a block away, where I had lunch before I caught the airport express train back to the airport to fly home...

**Lantau Island**: I’ve been here before, many years ago, before the cable car line to the island was built. So, I joined a day bus group tour (booked on Klook) to visit **Po Lin Monastery & Big Buddha (see photo 14 attached), Tai O Village where Jackie Chan filmed Police Story (see photo 12 & 13 attached), took a 20min boat ride to see pink dolphins – and we did! rode the Ngong Ping cable car (I took the standard cabin, not crystal bottom one) which gives you great views of the airport haha (see photo 15 attached)** and it was a pleasant trip. **You can definitely do this trip on your own, independently, just note down the bus times and check the routes so you don’t waste time waiting around or have to backtrack to get to where you want to go.** I left the tour group after the cable car ride to visit **Tung Chung / Citigate Outlets** which was really disappointing = very expensive compared to my last visit here, many years ago… I only bought a few things from the **Disney outlet store** which has left-over items from previous seasons and at reduced / clearance prices – which is good. I had a steak dinner here in one of the local restaurants, on the higher levels, which was nice!

**In case you need more ideas and inspiration on what else you can see or do around HK, here’s a list of other places and attractions that I’ve visited on previous trips:**

**Victoria’s Peak with the Tram Ride** during the day and at night = recommend

**Madame Tussaud’s**

**Repulse Bay, Stanley Markets** – part of a day group tour stop, just looked around = don’t go out of your way to visit this

**Disneyland** – visited within 3 months of its opening, so more than 20 years ago now…

**Ocean Park** – been here twice and recommend a full day visit so you can see / do everything!

**Central area including Hollywood Rd, Cat St, Man Mo Temple, Tramoramic** = heritage tram ride with the audio headphones experience which I recommend doing, if you have the time and want to sightsee sitting down...

**Chinese Traditional Junk harbour city cruise** - once is enough, I think standing at Avenue of Stars is enough for the view.

**Chin Lin Nunnery & Nan Lian Gardens** – if you love visiting temples and want a quieter experience, go here.

**10,000 Buddhas Monastery** - wow, I really enjoyed visiting this place!

**Wong Tai Sin Temple** – famous / popular temple, visit if you have time.

**Snoopy World inside New Town Palace, Sha Tin** - I’m a Snoopy fan so I had to go here, shop in air-con and have lunch.

**Sky 100 Observatory Deck & Cultural Centre** – went years ago, its great but the glass windows reflect in your photos which I hate…

**HK Museum of History**

**completed a Dim Sum cooking class** – fun activity to do with friends and you eat what you cook!

**joined a group day tour to take you to the lesser known areas of HK, the neighbourhoods where you can walk into a typical HK apartment and see how small and how expensive HK is** - recommend doing if you want access to the inside of a typical HK apartment, look on Klook, Trip.com, get your guide, Viator, Tripadvisor for the best tour to join...

**joined a day group tour to Macau with Porta do Cerco crossing point into China, with visit to Senado City Square, Goddess of Mercy Kun Iam, St Pauls Ruins, A-Ma Temple** – I recommend joining a group tour so the logistics is sorted for you, you don’t have to worry and wait around to get to each attraction and they give you plenty of time to explore each place.

**joined a day group tour to Cheung Chau Island with visits to Pak Tai Temple, Tin Tau Temple, Kamfa Temple / Golden Flower Shrine adjacent to Peng Chau Wing On Street** - if you want to visit some of the islands and their attractions, to see the highlights... You’re on holiday, so let someone else guide you around for a day or two…


**FINAL THOUGHTS**: I’m a city girl so I will never get sick of visiting HK. **I love HK! Most visitors, either love HK or hate HK.** I think, HK is quite similar to Tokyo, Osaka, Shanghai, in terms of the lights at night, the atmosphere, how busy and crowded the city is or can get. There’s lots to see and do but it really depends on your interests to determine how many days or nights that you should spend in HK. **I suggest a 4-night stay (so you have 3 full days to sightsee) for a first visit and if you want to shop a lot, go to Disneyland, or Ocean Park, take a ferry to Macau then add an extra day for each of these places.**

There are still many places that I haven’t visited and areas that I haven’t explored in HK. **HK is the only city in the world that I enjoy as a stopover, every few years if I can, as it feels like home to me! Its an Asian city but really Westernised so I feel comfortable coming here again and again. There’s lots of English signs everywhere, its really easy to use their public transport system even at 10pm, its safe!** I consider HK a multi-cultural city, a gateway to the east and west, a fusion of old and new, a real interesting mix of architecture, history, culture, cuisine, modes of transportation, etc.

**The only thing that I really don’t like about HK is the humidity. I suggest to visit a mall for lunch so you’re out of the sun during the hottest and brightest time of the day, can access a toilet, give yourself time to relax with some air-con – plus your legs and feet will need regular breaks, and massages, because HK is a city worth exploring on foot!**

Thanks for reading. Thats it. No more trip reports from me for a while now... til next year...

I hope this is useful information and advice and I hope you all enjoy visiting China and HK! Safe travels!

1p9d081,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1p9d081/overbearing_mils_wedding_eve_ultimatum_sign_these/,Overbearing MIL's Wedding Eve Ultimatum: Sign These or No I Do—Spoiler: We Did Anyway,"This story is not real; it is a practice in creative writing. I'm going for the overbearing—but not psychotic—level of MIL.

Crystal was in the bridal suite, veil half-pinned, heart racing with that pre-""I do"" glow. Enter Sara—my future MIL, all pearls and passive-aggression—clutching a manila envelope like it was the holy grail. ""Darling,"" she cooed, ""a quick signatures sesh before we proceed. For the \*family's\* sake."" Out came three papers, and she wasn't budging till I signed.

\*\*Paper 1: A pre-filled divorce decree with Scott's name already inked. ""Just in case things don't work out,"" she said sweetly. She would hold on to it and file it if she felt the marriage was going bad—or if I broke her contract.\*\*

\*\*Paper 2: Prenup from hell. If we split—for \*any\* reason—Scott keeps everything post-wedding. Marital home? His. Joint savings? His. My side hustle Etsy shop? Uh, still mine... maybe, if I'm allowed to continue it after today.\*\*

\*\*Paper 3: The ""Rules for a Proper Marriage"" manifesto. Bold of her to assume I needed lessons, but okay—here's the full 10-point sermon on how to be a ""good daughter-in-law"":\*\*  

1) \*\*Live in \*their\* family home for five years so I could ""learn to be a proper wife."" (Subtext: My apartment decor is trash.)\*\*  

2) \*\*Produce a son in year one, named Bob Jr. after FIL. (Because every king needs a mini-me, apparently.)\*\*  

3) \*\*No solo time with any man outside the family—not even the mailman—for ""fidelity insurance.""\*\*  

4) \*\*Any money I earn goes straight into the family bank account. ""Team effort, dear—separate finances breed resentment.""\*\*  

5) \*\*Master Sara's exact cooking recipes until Bob and Scott can't tell my pot roast from hers. ""A wife's love is in the details... and the gravy.""\*\*  

6) \*\*Mandatory weekly family dinners at Sara's table—no excuses, even for date nights. ""How else will we stay close?""\*\*  

7) \*\*Crystal's career moves require Sara's pre-approval; family comes first, always. ""Ambition's fine, but not if it means missing bedtime stories.""\*\*  

8) \*\*All holidays follow Sara's traditions to the letter—tree up by Thanksgiving, no ""modern twists."" ""We've done it this way for generations.""\*\*  

9) \*\*Wardrobe check-ins: Sara vets outfits for ""modesty and class."" ""You represent \*us\* now, sweetheart.""\*\*  

10) \*\*Monthly ""bonding"" sessions with Sara—scrapbooking, tea, whatever she deems ""enriching."" ""Mother-daughter time builds unbreakable ties.""\*\*

My stomach churned. This wasn't love; it was a lease on my life. But with the organist warming up and 200 guests seated, I caved. Reluctantly, I signed, each loop of my J feeling like a noose. Sara beamed—""Wise girl!""—and flounced out.

The door barely clicked before my maid of honor (bestie, lifesaver) was on me. ""What fresh hell was \*that\*?"" she hissed, yanking the zipper on my gown. I swapped it for a backup wrap dress, barefoot and fuming, and bolted to the hall's back entrance. Guests chatted obliviously; Scott paced the wings, clueless.

I hopped onto the altar steps—vow platform turned soapbox—and waved for quiet. ""Everyone? Attention, please."" The hum died. ""The wedding's off. I \*adore\* Scott—I want this more than air—but I can't marry him. Not after the paperwork his mother just forced me to sign.""

Gasps hit like a wave. Aunties clutched bouquets; uncles checked their phones. Then Bob—FIL, eternal doormat—shot up from row one, face tomato-red. ""What \*paperwork\*?"" He stormed Sara's pew, snatching the envelope from her claws. ""Bob, honey, it's nothing—"" she started, but he was already ripping it open.

The crowd pressed in: ""Read it!"" ""What'd she do?"" Bob, voice like gravel, silenced them and boomed:

\*\*""'Exhibit A: Divorce decree, pre-signed by groom. For ""just in case"" contingencies.' Sara, what in blazes? 'Exhibit B: Prenup—groom retains all marital assets upon dissolution.' And these rules? Cohabiting here for five years? Grandson Bob by year one? Banning her from solo coffee runs with the barista? Pooling \*her\* earnings? Replicating your meatloaf? Weekly dinners? Career vetoes? Holiday lockdowns? Outfit inspections? Forced scrapbook marathons? For 'protection'? Protection from \*what\*—her happiness?""\*\*

Laughter mixed with outrage; Sara went ghost-white, whispering furiously, ""It's to keep the family \*intact\*, Bob! Women today don't know their place!"" A cousin snorted, ""Her place? Not in \*your\* guest room.""

Scott—my rock, finally unfrozen—marched up, snatched the pages, and \*riiiip\*—shredded them into confetti. It snowed over the aisle as he pivoted to security: ""Remove my mother. Effective immediately."" Sara wailed—""My boy! After all I've done!""—but ushers herded her out amid sympathetic head-shakes.

Cue glorious chaos: My MOH dashed in with the dress. Zip, veil, done—in under a minute. Scott pulled me close amid cheers: ""Marry me anyway?"" Hell yes.

We did. Vows under the chandeliers, rings exchanged with whoops, reception? Epic—open bar, zero Sara. Two years on: Thriving in \*our\* home, baby girl expected (named after my mom, suck it Sara), and Bob? Weekend grandpa hero. Sara? Radio silence. Best ""just in case"" ever? Marrying the man, not the monster-in-law.

What would \*you\* have done—sign and ghost, or altar-announce? Creative writing peeps, roast or boost?",0,1764382562.0,JUSTNOMIL,3,0.04,False
1p9czsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1p9czsz/should_i_end_a_friendship_over_her_boyfriend_and/,Should I End a Friendship Over Her Boyfriend and a New Friend?,"TW: SA

Hi everyone, I appreciate anyone willing to read and give me advice going forward. So, I (19F) have been best friends with a girl M (20F) for four and a half years. The term ""best friends"" really doesn't do justice to how close we were, more like sisters. She has been in a relationship with R (21M) for four years. 

I haven't been very fond of R for a few years. I've always thought he was a shitty boyfriend to her, but overall, a good guy. I tolerated him when the three of us would hang out. But when they had problems, I was the one who heard it all, so of course I didn't think highly of him. This never really affected her and I's friendship much, only briefly at the beginning of their relationship. He always knew how close she and I were and respected that as well. 

Two months ago, her parents were out of town, and he was spending the night with her. He told me they were going to do some drinking, and they invited me over. The three of us were hanging out, but M doesn't really drink, so it was mostly just R and me. Like halfway through the night, he and I are fairly drunk. M leaves to use the bathroom, and when she walks out, he calls me over. He starts non-consensually rubbing my ass. I was shocked and pulled his hand off. She came back, and he signaled to me to be quiet. 

A little while later, she went to use the bathroom again, and he made a bunch of weird comments and touched me more, even while I told him to stop. I was super uncomfortable and felt violated. He finally got up, and she came back, so I decided to call it a night. I was sleeping in the guest room, and they were in her bedroom. I planned on telling her when we were all sober and alone. He passed out fairly quickly, so she came into the guest room to check on me. I told her everything. We talked it all out, cried, and came up with a plan of action. We said this wouldn't hurt our friendship, and we'd be fine. 

At the moment, I said some things out of shock. She told me she didn't want to break up with him, but would if I said she had to. I told her not to, and that I wasn't even upset about it, I just didn't want this to ruin our friendship. I really didn't think her staying with him would bother me that much. 

The next morning, they talked it out. He said he had blacked out and remembered none of that. She always believed me, so that wasn't a concern. She and I talked the next day, and I told her I felt differently than I did last night. She understood, and we both decided to take some space, so we could sort out our thoughts. 

We didn't talk for a week, which was the longest we'd ever gone without talking. I thought space would've been a few days, and that she was dying to fix this, too. She still hung out with her boyfriend and talked with him, but wouldn't talk with me. We work together, so we were forced to see each other eventually. Finally, I messaged her to see if she wanted to talk. She said she would listen to me, but didn't really have anything to say. 

We sat down for coffee. We both ended up talking everything over. I told her it was really hard for me to understand how she could keep him in her life, and that I felt I would never keep a boyfriend who did that to her if the roles were reversed. I expressed my hurt, and she listened to it all. She brought up some negative things about our friendship that she had been wanting to address. We hit a standstill, and she said she wants to move forward from this. I realized if I couldn't move forward, our friendship would end, and at the time, I didn't want that. So, we said we would feel things out, and we'd slowly get back to normal. We also decided that our friendship was too co-dependent, especially on her side, and we needed some distance for that. This conversation was over a month ago. 

I know her better than anyone. I knew she would fill the space with other people, because that's what she does. She can't stand to be alone, which is why she won't end her relationship. What I didn't anticipate was how much it would cut me out. We've hung out twice since that talk. Before, we talked every single day and hung out at least once a week. She has completely replaced me with one other friend, A. What M and I were doing, she has done the same now, but with A. Their friendship has ebbed and flowed for years, and conveniently, right when M and I have taken this distance, they've gotten incredibly close. She keeps making jokes about me ""finding someone to replace her with,"" I think, as a way to justify what she's done. 

Now I'm at a place where I'm not sure where to go from here. I don't think being surface-level friends with her is something I want. This has hurt me so much, more than I think she understands. From my perspective, I was sexually assaulted by someone I trusted, my best friend's boyfriend, and it's caused me to be cut and replaced from her life. I know there's more to it, but that's how it feels. 

Should I hold onto the friendship? Has anyone had a situation like this before? I feel like I should just move on from this friendship, but would that be preemptive? Any opinions or advice would be helpful. Thank you for reading!

1p9czms,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1p9czms/why_do_some_people_not_get_withdrawals_from_things/,Why do some people not get withdrawals from things?,"I’m 31M. I’m wondering what the science of behind some people not getting withdrawals even when they go hard on a substance for a long time. 

I tried to Google it but the answer was vague and unhelpful. 

To use myself as an example, I can drink a ton of coffee or caffeine everyday for a year or more, then just stop and be fine. No headaches, no fatigue, zero effect. I’ve been like that for my whole life with caffeine. 

Or with nicotine, I used to vape all day everyday high nicotine concentration, was super addicted, yet was able to stop with almost zero withdrawals. 

This was true up until recently when I started an antipsychotic and now I felt withdrawals. But by day three I was entirely fine, and I never get headaches or anything like that from withdrawals. 

Maybe it’s my age, but for alcohol, I had temporary alcohol use disorder for months, drank a twelve pack or more every day, and then just stopped and was fine. No withdrawals. I’m a slim person too.  

I’m sure there are people who can cut off other things and be fine. I’m just wondering why some people get withdrawals for things so easily and others don’t?

About a month ago, I was at Clouffee & Tea near AMC Town Square watching their AI robot make my Boba tea. A girl came in and started talking to me — asked where I was from, how long I was staying (I'm visiting Vegas from Eastern Europe). She mentioned she works as a barista at Starbucks and was worried about AI Barista taking her job.

Here's the thing — her family was right there with her and she still walked up to me and started a conversation. That takes guts. She kept asking me questions, trying to keep it going.  I asked where she was from, she said here. She told me about her job, shared that she was worried about her future. She was giving me every opening possible and I just... stood there like an idiot watching a robot make boba. Gave her one-word answers. Absolutely nothing to work with even though she was carrying the whole conversation. Eventually she had to leave, and I've been kicking myself ever since.

So now me and my buddy have a list of Starbucks locations in the Vegas area, and we're checking them one by one like some kind of romantic comedy. I'm aware this sounds insane.

If this was you, or you know who this is — I'd love to buy you a coffee. That AI-made boba was honestly terrible. Would much rather try a real coffee made by an actual human. Preferably you.",0,1764382476.0,vegas,2,0.35,False

When a superchatter says she'll be listening to Relatable Reese while getting out Christmas decorations, Reese says when she lived in Kansas City she got her Christmas tree and decorations out the day after Thanksgiving but she can't live her life that way anymore because she lives in such a small house. Reese could still decorate for the season because fans bought her smaller Christmas trees last year and her Bible superchatter gave her Christmas stockings two years ago.   
  
Reese complains that when she went to Starbucks today to get a gingerbread chai, they tried to get her to order through the app. When she got to the Goodwill, she found out they mistakenly gave her a black coffee. She was pissed and she says she had to drive all the way back and H felt unsafe because she was driving way over the speed limit. Reese says she handed the drink back to the barista and was upset that the staff didn't admit they made a mistake. She keeps saying the barista gaslighted her by saying ""OK, let me remake it."" She emphasizes Starbucks didn't give her a refund and that she paid $7 for that drink.   
  
She says she was eating a slice of turkey yesterday but then held it up and made a scene because ""there was a fat ball in the middle of it."" She claims she only slept for an hour last night and she stayed up all night cooking the night before Thanksgiving. Reese is upset that no one ate her deviled eggs or corn casserole and she says maybe that's because there was hair from her pets in those dishes.   
  
Reese shows a picture of her stepbrother teaching H how to play something on the guitar yesterday. She says he also spent some time teaching H how to drive during his visit.  
  
Reese shows screenshots a fan posted in her Facebook group showing Reese doing a stream with Jeff compared to a recent picture of Reese. Her chatters rave about how much better and happier she looks now. Reese says she really looks forward to moving to Ecuador and making even more changes while bringing her YouTube channel along with her.   
  
Reese says she wants to talk about an welcome comment that someone who claims to support her left on Cults and Crims. The commenter told Reese if she's serious about saving money, she should separate needs from greed and consider selling some of her jewelry. Reese says she'll live naked and sell her son before she pawns her turquoise.   
  
The commenter said Tommy has to compete every day with the memory of a dead man because of Reese's tattoos that are in honor of Fred. Reese says Tommy has a huge portrait of his ex-wife tattooed on his side and has his ex-wife's name tattooed on his wrist and insists those tattoos don't bother her. That's fine if that's how Reese really feels, but she has already told her fans in the past that Tommy didn't like how much she brought up Fred in comparison to him.   
  
The commenter went on to say more about how Reese needs to give Tommy what he wants from their relationship. Reese says this woman is really overstepping and her chat needs to hear about it. Reese and her chat start calling that woman crazy and making fun of her. A fan gets angry on Reese's behalf and sends a $36 superchat telling Reese to spend more money. That's exactly the reaction Reese is hoping for when she talks about anyone who criticizes her.   
  
She says one of the top things she has learned this year is that people aren't who they say they are. Reese learned that lesson about Tommy and Johnny this year but now she's ignoring that they are con artists and she's criticizing former friends who are no longer in her corner.

Reese claims that on their first date, Jeff kept looking up women's short skirts when people went up and down the stairs while he and Reese were at a table at the bottom of the stairs. He admitted that he always picked that table for that reason, she says. Reese claims she has never seen Tommy be creepy around a woman but she made Tommy pay for Jeff's creepy behavior. She starts retelling a lot of negative things about Jeff that she has already talked about many times.   
  
Reese says there were ladies in a store today who were way too loud and saying ""Ho, ho, ho!"" She adds that there were people at the country club she and Jeff belonged to in Kansas City who were in love with the sound of their own voices and would intentionally talk way too loud. ""I hate when women dick-swing,"" she says. Reese was shopping for clothes even though she had been admitting recently that she doesn't need any more clothes. She says she'd like to record people who talk too loud in the future and put those recordings on her channel as shorts.

Smashed as my left headlight
My shadow wore my coat

I’m really hoping vets or people with experience can help me understand what is happening with my dog and what the kindest next step is. I feel completely lost and heartbroken.

Background:
About a week ago, I brought my dog(3 years old male) to the vet and he was confined for four days. He had a catheter placed and was on multiple medications. The vets recommended surgery, but we couldn’t afford to continue the confinement or the surgical costs. Even though it wasn’t advised for him to be discharged yet, we had no choice but to take him home on Day 4.

At home, we tried our best to continue his care. We fed him the prescribed urinary diet and gave some of the medications, but not all, because we couldn’t afford everything that was prescribed. We were really hoping he would stabilize, but things have gotten worse.


His symptoms now:
- Pale gums
- Straining to pee only a drop or two comes out no matter how hard he tries
- Can still walk to his water bowl, but is extremely tired and mostly sleeps
- Drinks water frequently, but his body doesn’t seem to tolerate it
- Vomiting different types: (undigested food, clear water, foamy, yellow, brown, dark coffee-colored liquid (which I’ve read can be blood) and earlier he had wheezing during the last part of vomiting
- Barely eating, last night he ate a little, then today only about 5cc and even that tiny amount comes back up
- Seems alert but exhausted and avoids eye contact
- Breathing a bit fast like in out motion
- Any food or water seems to upset him
- He’s still trying to pee and drink, but his body clearly can’t handle much

What I feel right now is that I feel like we’ve done a lot already took out loans for his emergency confinement, meds, catheter, prescription diet, home care including force feeding him and staying up late to watch him cuz he vommit a lot but at the same time, I feel like it wasn’t enough and that I should have done more. I’m heartbroken and confused because I can see his body is giving up. Even tiny amounts of food or water don’t stay down.

I’m also struggling because he seems to be telling me he’s tired, but I don’t know if I should let him pass naturally beside me or take him for euthanasia.

My concerns about the decision:

If I let him pass at home, I know he’ll be beside me, in a familiar place, without the stress of travel or strangers.
But euthanasia might prevent suffering. I just worry the clinic environment and new people will stress him out in his last moments.

I also don’t know if his condition is still treatable at all. At this point, he can’t tolerate food, vomits different substances, can’t pee properly, and his gums are pale.

My questions:
1. Based on these symptoms, is his passing likely very close (hours to a day)?
2. Does this sound like active organ failure that cannot be reversed without intensive vet care?
3. Would letting him die naturally at home likely be painful or distressing?
4. Or is euthanasia the kinder, more humane choice at this stage?
5. Do dogs in their final hours still get up and walk around a little, like how he still walks to drink before lying down again?

I don’t want him to suffer. I just want to make the right choice for him. Any guidance, especially from vets, would mean a lot. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.",2,1764381838.0,AskVet,4,0.75,False

I've raised him since he was 3yr.) does. My husband sent a ext to my MIL (this is bc she won't answer calls ever, never, the last couple years) setting a boundary of showing love to ALL our children NOT just the older one or she can leave our family alone. ( his childhood makes me sad & she should be one of those prisons that's a dark deep hole in the ground) but he always said that at least she was TRYING to make up for it with the oldest, that everything she did and all the love and happiness she was giving him is what allowed him to continue to have a relationship with her. Then comes along our son (and no she never acted like she hated me or anything, in fact we used to get along really well, until I had her son's babies, which she would ALWAYS mention about how we shouldn't be having kids during a time I thought I couldn't and was clinically depressed bc of it! Which should have been a red flag). Now our 2nd son (my 1st biological), he is developmentally dislayed and he doesn't talk still. He'll say something in proper context and then never say it again or only once in a while. He babbles nonstop and it sounds like he's almost saying something. Now let me be clear that no one knew this was gonna happen yet when the issues started with her, because it's been his entire life and she got worse with my daughter. Which by the way I had a panick attack crying and told my husband he needed to get me home ASAP because I couldn't stop worrying about my son. About how he was probably being starved (here's a piece a of cheese & bread for the day bc I can't be bothered to make you a pb&just but here let me cook the teenager who can make himself food a 3 course meal!!) And probably was being shoved in his playpen that he could climb right out of to run around a room that is right at the top of very steep stairs, were he could easily KILL himself by dropping giant shit from bookshelves on top of his head!!! (I witnessed this when we went to pick him up and he ""napping"", I came in time to just stop him. At this time the teenager was supposed to be helping watch him, she told him he could just play video games so he let his little brother stay up there for 5 fing hrs, while she sat in one of her four personal rooms to smoke cigarettes.) OH and he was covered in poop of course! So while I was in the hospital having my daughter and neither the teenagers or her response matched up to what was supposedly happening with him, I completely lost it and I really needed the time to recover especially as I couldn't get help at home really since my husband basically works 12hrs day (with his Stepdad, her husband, btw) and I have no family, but I couldn't do it. They wouldn't let me out immediately but it was quicker than they wanted. That baby will be a year old next week and she was 3 or 4 months when my husband sent her a very long message expressing his feelings and even though it was giving her an ultimatum I felt it was not written in an attack type of way. It was very obviously a son desperately pleading for his mom to love him and all his children. She never responded. So neither of us reached out (I was always the one initiating conversations with updates & pics of my kids) and waited for her to care enough about our children too. Especially the middle one. As i said he is delayed. He has spent most of his life isolated with me (again dad working & teen either at school/friends/room/mom's & me no family). She never reached out to either of us. But then it doesn't end there. She's of course spinning it to be that we are being mean to her because she can't handle babysitting him for us bc of her physical disability. ( which by the way she does NOT have, she is on SSI for MENTAL Health issues only!!! And also she supposedly had my disability until I got diagnosed with it, now its always changing.) We found this out when my husband's stepdad had a convo about how he needs to patch up things with his mom. When my husband said ""I'm not asking her to babysit him but why can't she pick him up to go shopping and for ice cream twice a year like she does with the teenager? And whenever we go to your house she just hides in a room smoking, only coming down to heat her coffee and let us all know how miserable she is and how she can't deal with even being around my kid today."" And his stepdad could only say ""You're right."". There's more, there's a lot. Like the fact that his stepdad was a lil annoyed at MY HUSBAND,  bc his wife decided not to do Thanksgiving this year bc they're not talking (which again, ball has been in HER court the whole time. Also she hasnt actually done thanksgicing in like 5 or 6 years) And making him miserable for it. So what do I do? I bake them (her, her husband, her mom, and her brother) a full-on traditional Thanksgiving dinner & pies (apple & pumpkin) all from scratch. Enough for both houses, from scratch. I literally spent 8 hours two days in a row cooking, and cleaning with like 3 hours sleep total while taking care of both my little ones, doing my college work, and pushing myself past my limitations repeatedly. My husband drops it off to his stepdad. And did I get even one thank you from any of the four adults in that house? No. I honestly didn't expect her to but I thought maybe since my FIL was so bummed he ""had to buy KFC for Thanksgiving dinner"" it would be the nice, and family, thing to do. His stepdad is more involved than her as I said. He stops and says hi to the kids and stuff but hes too busy to hangout really. With the holidays being here I'm just really upset that she'd rather never talk to us, and tell her husband lies about my husband about arguments they had 4 years ago and trying to make it seem like now and she did nothing wrong, when she did then too, and that my children will never experience anything like what I had with my grandma. I named my daughter after my grandma, I miss her so much, and she would care about my children. My mom would have too, in her own way, but unlike my husband (even if she was still alive) I would never allow my mother into my children's lives anyways. There is no ""making up"" for being a bad person. I usually wouldn't just vent this to strangers on the internet but I have no family or friends. I don't want to put my negative feelings about this onto my husband when I know how hard and hurtful this is to him. My job is to support him and be his shoulder to cry on. To be the woman that shows she cares about him and his feelings. But its eating me. I had to get some of it out too. Because these are my children too, and I love them dearly.

I've always been chubby all my life and it wasn't even something that bothers me. Anyway, I used to go to a little cafe near my house every Saturday I never noticed anyone other than the barista, one day when I was leaving the cafe this guy stops me and told me he noticed me coming often and he said he just wanted to tell I'm gorgeous and he gave me his phone number.

I was really touched for some reason, we started texting then meeting casually and 2 months in he asked me to be his girlfriend I said yes and that was the worse mistake of my life. I didn't notice at first but he started feeding me not much at the beginning but then every time we were together there was food I never noticed the fact that I was eating the majority of the food.

He eventually convinced me I was better and I should stop going to therapy and for whatever reason I believed him and I stopped going to therapy. 6 months after that we started living together, at the time I wasn't working, I was living off the money my mom left me but after moving together he told me I could be a ""stay at home girlfriend"" and he'd cover the bills.

Then I was basically eating every waking moment and I can't understand how I didn't realized what was happening, why wasn't I concerned about the crazy amount of food we had at home, I lived in isolation eating day and night basically, and he was always so sweet, so understanding and loving he made me tea when I had stomach aches from the binging, bought me new bigger clothes when mine wouldn't fit anymore, massage my knees because they started hurting for all my rapid weight gain we were together 3 years. For 3 whole year I didn't realize I was killing myself eating fast food and all greasy and unhealthy food I don't even think I ate a single vegetables that wasn't on a burger.

I starting throwing up constantly unable to sleep because of the pain of binging all day, I wanted to go to a doctor and he convinced me not to, he started to tell me loves me but nobody else would, that only he can handle my horrible attitude and I believed him.

I was extremely depressed I started fantasizing with died and the horrible thing is I was so deep into this that I fantasized about chocking and dying or dying of a heart attack or something. One day I was grocery shopping alone and I saw kids running around and it was like waking up I wonder when was the last time I run? Jump? Laugh? And I just didn't go back to his place I grab the money he gave me for groceries and went to the bus stop and went to my aunt's house a couple cities over. 

He tried to reach me but I simply change my phone number and delete all my social media accounts. That was back in may, my aunt cried so much when she saw me because I basically disappeared for 3 years.

I'm staying with her now, she made me appointments with doctors and a therapist who specializes in eating disorders, I'm a little better I think but I still have a long way to go, I was diagnosed with generalized depression, binge eating disorders and bulimia nervos, I lost about 35 lbs but that's like the babiest step  ever, I'm gladly on meds too and they help and reconnecting with my aunt and my cousins improve my mood significantly. I can walk more then 10 blocks without dying now and although everything is improving little by little I still feel such an emptyness and sadness because I didn't notice the signs before it got to that point.

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.

I’m 22M from Spain. I’m introverted in real life, practical and mostly logical, and I tend to be reflective. Most of the time I’m friendly and polite. I sometimes joke or act a bit dumb on purpose cause it's fun. I study computer science and AI. I speak Spanish and English. I also don't have any social media besides YouTube (if you can even consider it that), and reddit. 

I don't have many hobbies, mainly watching YouTube videos or movies, reading stuff sometimes, playing video games sometimes, and studying while listening to chill music and maybe having a cup of coffee or tea.

 I try to reply when I can, but sometimes I get busy with Uni or life stuff.

I’m looking for someone I can talk to regularly, by text or voice. I like deep conversations but I also enjoy small everyday stuff. I prefer people who put effort into conversations, someone who checks in now and then, asks how things are, or brings up random small topics. I’d like someone in a similar situation who wants a steady friend to talk about anything. It would be a plus if our tastes in movies, series or music line up, but it’s not essential.

This is a house that only does EdPs (Edit: there are ""body oils,"" soaps, and candles on the site as well), but while I am someone who vastly prefers the wear and evolution of oil perfumes, I still couldn’t pass this up.

For people not familiar with them, Imaginary Authors is a perfume house that sort of straddles the fence between indie and niche. It’s a bit too weird (and reasonably priced) to be considered “niche,” but also has a way more robust marketing department than most indie houses (certainly not DIY). Along with notes and things like that, every description of a fragrance on their website comes with a blurb for a fictional book that matches the “vibe” of the fragrance. Some of them are stories that I really wish were real, lol.

Disclaimer: When I test and write fragrance reviews, I don’t double-check the notes list beforehand, operating solely on my perception (though I ostensibly had chosen these fragrances because of their notes).

Now, on to the reviews!

“The Cobra and the Canary” – *Twenty-three-year-old Neal Orris is desperately searching for a getaway ticket from his dead-end job and the decaying Virginia town where he grew up when a tip from a clairvoyant leads him to a barn housing his deceased father’s secret obsession, a pristine 1964 Shelby Cobra Roadster. His first stop is the tobacco farm where his best friend, Ike, is employed, and the two never look back. Aiming for the Palm Springs racetracks and prize winnings that would keep them afloat, their journey is a blur of seedy motels and stiff drinks, cool swimming pools and hot debutantes, burnt rubber and cigarette smoke. Each stop finds the friends inventing new pseudonyms and personas for themselves, their innocent game hurtling them into the throes of decadence and desolation.*

***lemon, orris, tobacco flowers, leather, hay fields, asphalt***

This one was a free sample that came with my set, so I decided to start with it (since it was outside of the book cover already, lol). I remembered really liking the blurb for this—very Hunter S. Thompson meets Ridley Scott—but deciding it was too masculine for my tastes. My initial impression… turned out to be accurate.

Make no mistake: this is a *handsome* perfume. Or cologne (in the colloquial sense). Lemon and (I believe) hay are the dominant notes to my nose, with whiffs of freshly rolled cigarettes; but there was an undercurrent of something that I couldn’t identify that I now believe is asphalt, looking at the notes—the asphalt that steams in the heat in road trip movies. It’s uncanny.

Rating: **3.5**/5 – Fear and Loathing in the Grand Canyon

“In Love with Everything” – *Written in 1982, this electrifying novel about sex, drugs, and decadence, in pre-Miami Vice Florida, follows a delinquent clique of teenage girls through nightclubs, roller discos, and seedy South Beach bars in search of anything to keep the party going. Driven by an inexhaustible enthusiasm, the girls navigate a series of potentially dangerous situations with naive ease, radiating their infectious light like a disco ball and turning even the darkest circumstances into a dance party. Lauded for its unflinchingly honest portrayal of strong, outspoken, resourceful young women whose sole motivation was to have a good time, the book stands in stark contrast to the male chauvinism of the era and still resonates today. Critics have called it “an essential examination of the joys of recklessness” and “an addictive story in which every sentence glistens with sticky sweet summer heat.”*

***raspberry, citrus pulp, coconut palm sugar, Madame Isaac Pereire, sandalwood, tropical punch, stardust***

I was really hoping I would love this one. It has notes that I’ve been drawn to in so many other fragrances, many of which wound up being a cough medicine cocktail on my skin. I was like, “Please, please let me get all the delicious fruit…” What I got was *not* what I expected, *but*… it was no less enjoyable. To my nose—and perhaps on my skin, I will give that allowance—it is almost identical to Stone & Wit “Turyin” (*pomegranate, plums, sandalwood, gunpowder*), just less smoky. In both, the most prominent olfactory feature is what I can only describe as “meaty pomegranate.”

Not sure what “stardust” is supposed to be, but the sandalwood is really making that raspberry dark and decadent—perhaps that Madame Isaac Pereire (rose) helps in that regard? It’s not a rose variety I’ve ever heard of (when I read the initial notes list, I thought it was a liqueur, lol). Altogether, while the projected image is bubblegum pop and neon raves, and the book blurb describes “*Spring Breakers*, but… better,” the end result is in another league entirely. It’s so much deeper and more complex than the book cover.

Rating: **5**/5 – ♫ *I can feel the heat, but it’s soothing / Heading down I search for the beat in / This dirty town / Downtown, the young ones are going / Downtown, the young ones are growing…* ♫

“The Language of Glaciers” – *Have you ever stood alone atop a mountain with chunky snowflakes swirling all around? Such is the splendor you will experience within The Language of Glaciers, a romantic epic which reaches incredible heights and inspires one to leave no moment unappreciated. From the stillness of a moonlit snowshoe excursion to the rush of witnessing an avalanche safely from above, the recollections of our unnamed narrator will captivate you the same way the solitary song of the snow owl captivated them. Find comfort in the cold and begin to see the world from stunning new perspectives. Critics have called it, “A slow-paced story that will burrow straight to the center of your soul,” and, “Sharp as ice and smooth as a glacial lake.”*

***white pine, lilac, cashmere, juniper, forget-me-not, blue bugle, virgin snowfall***

Holy pepper, Batman! That was the first thing that smacked me in the face when I sprayed this: black pepper. Wow. Actually, it’s the same scent—which in real life reminds me of black pepper—that I get from ice boxes that need to be refreshed. So… kudos on capturing that sensation.

Unfortunately, I didn’t detect much evolution with this. After the black pepper, it slowly morphed into a semisweet flower that I now believe to be lilac. Looking back, I got this fragrance to take the last spot in my sample set, so it’s not a surprise that I’m ultimately not wowed by it—while I’m fond of juniper and conifers, I don’t think I’ve ever liked a fragrance that boasted “cashmere” (or the scent molecule “cashmeran,” which is similar to amber, which I don’t like).

Rating: **2**/5 – cold, peppery, and lonely

“Cape Heartache” – *“Cape Heartache” is the lone American contribution to Philip Sava’s wildly popular series of exploration novels. It is based loosely on an expedition he made to the Pacific Northwest as a teenager in 1881 and is generally regarded as the most candid and clearheaded of his works. Revolving around a homestead he built in a coastal grove of old growth trees, the novel documents his romance with a young woman who was a descendent of the Nehalem Tribe. Its themes of leaving the familiar and finding comfort and solace in a new place still resonate today.*

***Douglas fir, pine resin, western hemlock, vanilla leaf, strawberry, old growth, mountain fog***

This one… oh, boy. This one has been on my radar since I first started getting into fragrances, and I was trawling through entries on Fragrantica. It sounded so unique: strawberries *and* pine trees? Together??? Some reviews were negative, comparing it to a car air freshener, but my curiosity has still been piqued for the better part of a decade.

In the first spray, there is the barest hint of fruit—the ghost of a strawberry. It leaves quickly, and you’re left with dewy pines and firs at high elevation, like driving through the town of Twin Peaks. It’s not an unpleasant aroma by any means (though you need to be a conifer connoisseur to not find it boring, as there is little change)… but I already have green & woody fragrances that scratch this itch for me. The strawberry was supposed to set this apart.

On the website, Imaginary Authors sells this in candle form, and I think I would actually like this as a candle. But not as a perfume.

Rating: **3.5**/5 – “Sheriff, what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing out here? Big and majestic…”

“Sundrunk” – *When Clementine Cope set foot in snow deeper than her knees, she knew it was for the last time. Leaving the rural Montana home where she’d been raised, with no plans other than to follow the setting sun, she’d wake up every morning and head towards the warmth, dreaming of Dennis Wilson, push pops in the sand, and convertibles. Her trek covers thousands of miles and delivers her first-ever view of the ocean. By the time summer hits, Clem is consumed by an incomprehensible joy. When she finally settles into a ramshackle surf camp with newfound friends outside of Santa Cruz, California, she realizes her story is only beginning. Bright and buoyant, dive into Sundrunk when you’re feeling down and watch your spirits lift like the rising tide.*

***neroli, rhubarb, honeysuckle, rose water, orange zest, first kiss***

On the surface, this is a fragrance I should adore. I love all the notes… except honeysuckle. I need to be very careful of honeysuckle, as it has caused me headaches in perfumes in the past. In the end, I chose this sample with the hope that the other notes would temper it and that it wouldn’t end up becoming white-floral-focused.

Once I finally sprayed this, I’d forgotten what most of the notes were (though I remembered there was one I was wary of), but still had faith I’d enjoy it. The aroma that reached me was surprising, because it was as though everything combined to brew the strongest cup of hibiscus tea in the world! I never would’ve thought this would smell like hibiscus, but there you go. Hibiscus tea in a beach house on the California coast. It’s lovely—though if I were to repurchase, I might opt for the body oil instead of the EdP.

Rating: **4.5**/5 – basking in the glow of the sun

“Saint Julep” – *On the outskirts of Clarksdale, Mississippi, at the end of a secluded dirt road, sat a small ramshackle church. It was not a place of worship but rather where many went to seek refuge during impoverished times. Legend has it the structure was transported to the wild mint field by hand, hoisted on the shoulders of two dozen men.*

*The outside remained simple and nondescript, but the interior was aglow with pilfered neon signs, Christmas lights, and a jukebox donated by the sheriff’s son. It was a distinctly secular place where locals who knew where to find it could share moonshine, socialize, and dance their troubles away. They called their ramshackle juke joint Saint Julep, and the oral histories compiled within paint a picture of that magical place where “the smiles were always free and salvation had the distinct smell of sweet mint.”*

***sweet mint, tangerine, southern magnolia, bourbon, grisalva, sugar cube***

“Saint Julep” was another one that had captivated my interest for a long time. What had held me back in the past was the tangerine note. I was leery of combining mint and orange (or something orange-adjacent). In fact, as much as I am a mint lover, I am very picky with its pairings and have often found other fruits to make it smell like cough medicine. But I but the bullet and tried this.

And this might actually be my favorite of the entire set. I *adored* it! I can’t really pick out a single note from everything listed, but it all combines to create an accord of the strongest yet most palatable mint—it’s not natural, but I don’t think it needs to be (though the artificiality might put some people off). I swear, I could bathe in this stuff. If I get a full-size EdP of anything from the set, it will definitely be this one. I can’t wait to break this back out in the summertime. This one lived up to the hype.

(Side note: reading the notes list for this review made me look up Grisalva, and it’s a synthetic fragrance molecule, patented by the IFF and designed to smell amber-like and slightly leathery. I’m not sure I necessarily got either accord from this.)

Rating: **5555**/5 – “You know the secret to a really good julep?” / “No, sir.” / “Well… you crush the mint down on the ice with your thumb, and you grind it in…”

“A City on Fire” – *A brilliantly dark graphic novel, “A City On Fire” is the story of two match-makers. Rupert literally fabricates matches in a factory on the waterfront while Frances writes a dating column for the city’s newspaper. Both are recluses who haunt the night’s shadows observing clandestine activities from afar but never partaking. That changes one fortuitous evening when they are both witness to the same high-profile murder and are forced to come together as an unlikely vigilante pair in order to save their own names.*

***cade oil, spikenard, cardamom, clearwood, dark berries, labdanum, burnt match***

I got this one as an outlier for my set, as it’s incredibly different from the others and goes into darker/smokier territories than I generally like to venture. The main reason I chose this, though, was the “book blurb” that went along with it. I want the “A City on Fire” graphic novel to be real, and I want to go out, buy it from a brick-and-mortal bookstore, and read it. I then want it to be adapted into a film, directed by Cary Fukunaga or Sam Mendes, or even Jennifer Lynch (though she mainly does TV).

*Anyway*… I made sure to wait to try this until I would be staying home, just in case, and I’m glad I did as this one is straight up weird. I have a good history with cade oil and cardamom, and I think labdanum is one of my favorite “traditional” bases, but… I never, *ever* would’ve expected this to smell like barbecue. But it does. Straight up mesquite honey. I swear to God.

So, if you like weird stuff and want to know what “barbecue perfume” smells like, go ahead and try “A City on Fire.”

Rating: **1**/5 – ♫ *I want my babyback-babyback-babyback…* ♫

“The Soft Lawn” – *Published in 1916, “The Soft Lawn” is a controversial portrait of adolescent upper-class rebellion in New England. The coming-of-age story follows a charmingly snotty college tennis champ who, after years of having everything handed to him on a silver platter, finds himself handing it all back. His selfless acts of altruism anger his family but catch the eye of a budding poet, setting in motion a secret romance that challenges the decorum of the well-to-do community. Shots are cooly volleyed back and forth but as tension rises, it becomes clear that only one side can triumph in the end.*

***linden blossom, grapefruit, laurel & ivy leaves, vetiver, oakmoss, fresh tennis balls***

After the previous weirdness, I was glad I’d saved at least one perfume toward the very end that I could be certain would *not* be weird, as I needed relief from the barbecue, lol. This one opened with a lovely soft lime that really raised my hopes—and I became quite glad that I’d chosen the “American D.H. Lawrence” (going by the blurb) fragrance. Sadly, after the lime opening, it becomes a laundry fragrance, and… I am not about that, sorry.

Rating: **2**/5 – if Downy made fabric softener in this, I’d buy it

“The Abandoned Mansion” – *Aimless twenty-somethings Calvin and Millie didn’t mean to drop off the face of the earth but when they stumbled onto an abandoned mansion while hiking in the Adirondacks, that’s just what they did. Lounging in the autumn light and lost among the stacks of paperbacks they decided to weather the winter in their found fortress. Spring brought hordes of wildlife, both indoors and out, but no sign of other humans (other than the one growing in Millie’s belly). It would be another four years before the burgeoning family would be forced out of their assumed home but they don’t plan to leave without putting up a fight.*

***cedar, quince, petitgrain, pimento berry, oakmoss absolute, ambreine, paperbacks***

This was the last one I tested, and I had completely forgotten what it was supposed to smell like. I thought there was coffee involved, and maybe some trees. What I ended up smelling was straight-up “masculine cologne.” I was surprised at how generic I’d found this. I couldn’t pick out anything *repulsive*, but neither could I pick out anything I even liked. Out of the two “cologne-like” fragrances, I very much prefer “The Cobra and the Canary” to this.

Due to the generic nature of “The Abandoned Mansion,” it wound up being my least favorite (even “A City on Fire” was doing something), so I was a bit sad to end the testing on such a low note.

Rating: **1**/5 – blah

All right, that’s it, that’s my Imaginary Authors order! And now that I’ve reviewed them all, these are my final rankings:

1. Saint Julep
2. In Love with Everything
3. Sundrunk
4. Cape Heartache
5. The Cobra and the Canary
6. The Soft Lawn
7. The Language of Glaciers
8. A City on Fire

 I try to reply when I can, but sometimes I get busy with Uni or life stuff.

I’m looking for someone I can talk to regularly, by text or voice. I like deep conversations but I also enjoy small everyday stuff.

I am just tired. Depleted. My chest feels tight, and I have to remind myself to take deep breaths. It’s the constant mental load. Not being able to finish a thought, a sentence, a text message, or a hot cup of coffee. It’s the way nothing ever stays clean or organized. The toys on the floor, and piles of junk that build up on every surface in the house. The light sleep and early wake ups. Feeling disconnected and bickering with my husband because we’re both exhausted and overwhelmed (him full time in school and me full time SAHM as well as part time work because we need the money). No time to myself ever unless it’s to do house chores or to work. Rushing from task to task all day long. The multitasking. Brain with 50 tabs open at all times. Not feeling present. Shoveling food and water down my gullet whenever I can (while standing up), because a kid always needs something, someone is crying or whining, or tugging at my clothes, or a toy is getting thrown across the room. No space. No time to breathe. An endless loop of other people’s needs. The chronic mom guilt — keeping tabs on everything, wondering am I doing enough or too much, the food situation in the house, activities, who needs what, what do I need from the store, what in the house needs fixing, what parenting topics do I need to research, wondering if what I’m doing is messing up my kids somehow. Feeling like a shell of a human. On some days, my nervous system feels so dysregulated. Like I might lose my ever-loving mind if I hear one more cry or whine. Every time I manage to break away for a moment to brush my teeth or get dressed or eat something, I’m always rushing and feel on edge, just anticipating hearing a cry or a fuss. My digestive system is all messed up and irregular cause of the stress and often not being able to go to the bathroom when I feel like I need to go because of the constant caretaking. Other moms I talk to seem a bit overwhelmed, sure, but I feel like a lot of them don’t fully relate to the way I feel — like I’m underwater with a straw — just gasping for breath — gasping for space, for time, for freedom. Praying for a pause button so I can just reset, deep clean the house, take care of a few odd jobs and some tasks that have haunted my to-do list for too long, finally clear the pile of mail that’s built up on the kitchen table, take a nap, drink a hot cup of tea in peace, BREATHE... Some days it feels like I’m just gritting my teeth and muscling through to the end, going through the motions, physically and mentally exhausted, and then once both kids are finally asleep, all I’m able to do is collapse into bed and watch a show until I pass out at 9 pm. Wake up and do it all over again. I love my kids to absolute death, but damn, this shit is just depleting. Anyway. On most days, I am holding it together quite well. But some days… I feel like this.

1p9cfn1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9cfn1,How to visualize anything with Gemini: A masterclass on using the new physics-aware infographic engine to create epic visuals with Nano Banana Pro,"**Mastering Infographics with Nano Banana Pro**

TL;DR: Google's new Nano Banana Pro (built on Gemini 3) has solved the biggest headache in AI art: Text & Layout. Unlike Midjourney or ChatGPT, it uses a Reasoning Engine to plan data placement and checks facts via Google Search before drawing. I generated 100 complex infographics (20 attached) to show just how great it is a visualizations. This post breaks down exactly how it works, why it's different, and the specific prompt structures I used to get these results.

We’ve all been there. You ask an AI for an infographic and it gives you a beautiful image full of alien gibberish text and charts that make zero mathematical sense.

**Enter Nano Banana Pro** 

I’ve been pushing this model to its absolute limit, and I’m convinced it changes things for founders, designers, marketers, and data nerds. It doesn't just hallucinate pixels; it **plans** the layout and **verifies** data before rendering.

As a marketing leader I have had fantastic graphic designers work for me for many years but these designs from Nano Banana Pro / Gemini 3 are just much better.   You can get them in 4K without the watermark on them.   

I’ve attached 20 examples ranging from **The Singularity Roadmap** to understanding things like **Music Theory, The Fabric of Reality, Food Physics, Deep Space, Quantum Computing and How F1 Cars Work..**. Here is how you can do this too.

Nano Banana Pro is the nickname for Google's latest image generation model built on the **Gemini 3** architecture. While previous models were just diffusion models (guessing pixels), this is a **Reasoning Image Engine**.

**Why it kills for Infographics:**

1. **Spatial Reasoning:** It simulates the logic of the scene. It understands that ""1950"" comes before ""2024"" on a timeline, or that the ""crust"" is above the ""mantle"" in a geological diagram.
2. **Google Search Grounding:** It can pull real-time data. If you ask for a Weather Infographic, it can actually look up current weather patterns to inform the visuals (though you should always double-check the stats!).
3. **Native 4K Text:** It renders crisp, legible text in multiple languages, even for dense labels.  You can force 4K resolution by generating the images in AI studio instead of just the Gemini canvas - and no watermark on images created via AI Studio

 The Reasoning Engine

When you ask for an Infographic about The Singularity standard models look at pixels of other cross-sections and guess. Nano Banana Pro appears to construct a logical skeleton of the image first using Gemini 3's reasoning capabilities. It calculates the layout, comes up with a design, checks data against google search, ensures the text fits, and *then* paints the pixels.

Pro Tips & Best Practices

**1. The Data-First Prompt Structure** Don't just say ""Make an infographic about coffee."" You need to feed the reasoning engine. Use this structure:

* **Topic:** ""Infographic about \[Topic\]""
* **Data Context:** ""Use real-world data for \[Year\] regarding \[Subject\].""
* **Visual Style:** ""Isometric 3D / Vintage parchment / Clean corporate flat.""
* **Layout:** ""Use a Roadmap flow / Treemap layout / Timeline / Cross-section cutaway.""

**2. Use Sketch-to-Image (Multimodal Input)** This is the killer feature. Draw a terrible boxy sketch on a piece of paper showing where you want the title and the charts. Upload that to Gemini with the prompt: *""Turn this sketch into a high-fidelity infographic about \[Topic\]. Maintain this exact layout but make it look like a \[Style\].""*

**3. Aspect Ratio is King** Infographics often fail because they are cramped.

* **Mobile/Social:** Prompt for `9:16` (Vertical). Great for Roadmaps).
* **Desktop/Print:** Prompt for `16:9` (Horizontal). Great for ""Timelines"" or ""World Maps.""

**4. Iterative Editing** Nano Banana Pro allows for region-based editing. If one statistic is wrong:

* Highlight the text area.
* Prompt: *""Change text to '50 Billion' instead of '50 Million'.""*
* It renders the text perfectly in the same font style without warping the rest of the image.

A Few Style Examples, but so many possibilities....

* **The Roadmap (See ""Singularity Roadmap""):**
   * *Prompt Keyword:* ""Curved timeline, glowing nodes, progression from left to right, distinct eras.""
* **The Cutaway** 
   * *Prompt Keyword:* ""Cross-section view, underground layers, depth markers (0m to 10,000m), educational labels.""
* **The Treemap** 
   * *Prompt Keyword:* ""Bento grid layout, rectangular blocks sized by value, distinct color coding per category.""
* **The Dashboard** 
   * *Prompt Keyword:* ""HUD style, central globe, surrounding circular widgets, data streams, neon borders.""

A few of my top tips after about a week of testing 

1.  Generate in AI Studio for 4K infographics with no Gemini watermark visible  
  
2.  I often ask Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT for several options of infographic prompts to help me create the infographic prompt.   You don't have to do this (and it can be fun to let Nano Banana try with a basic prompt) but but it turns out the LLMs can create really great prompts that really level up your result.  
3.  Some people have criticized the infographics as ""too busy"" and that is a matter of opinion.  I have found that asking for there to be less than 400 words leads to it being more readable.    
4.  You can create Infographics in NotebookLM now too.   And you can put in a custom prompt and choose from three levels of detail.  

We are moving from Prompt & Pray to Prompt & Plan. With Gemini 3's reasoning, you can now visualize complex articles, business reports, or study notes instantly with high factual and spatial accuracy.

**Check out the 20 examples attached.** 

Some people have asked me for the 4K versions of these graphics since Reddit doesn't display the full greatness that is generated.  I created a gallery page on my site you can download any of these you like.  Not selling anything, just showing my work:   [https://thinkingdeeply.ai/gallery](https://thinkingdeeply.ai/gallery)

The point of this post is that you can visualize just about anything with Nano Banana Pro creating an epic infographic in 30-60 seconds.

Google was undercooking it at launch and didn't tell us how to create these epic infographics.  Consider this the missing manual.

I’m doing my first week of night shifts at Westview Med and they gave me this laminated card w rules on it.  
Didn’t think much of it bc every place got “rules,” whatever.

But these ones r literally taped above the med cart like someone wants you to keep looking at them.

Rule 1: keep the hall light on low but never off.  
Rule 2: if a patient calls your name from behind you, check the rooms first.  
Rule 3: don’t open the supply closet if it’s already unlocked.  
Rule 4: don’t look thru Curtain 12 after midnight. (???)  
Rule 5: if you mess up rule 4, walk away slow and act like you didn’t notice.

I thought it was a joke ngl.

Curtain 12 is in the old wing, the part that feels kinda stale all the time.  
Nobody uses it bc the room’s “under reno,” but honestly it just looks abandoned.  
Dusty machines, old charts still in the drawers, the whole vibe is off.

Last night around 12:20 I got a bed alarm from 214 but the sound glitched??  
It kept cutting in n out like underwater audio.  
When I walked toward it, I swear the hallway lights got that weird dim-drop thing hospitals do right before generators kick in.  
Except nothing kicked in.  
It just… stayed dim.

I heard a soft scraping sound from the old wing.  
Thought maybe maintenance forgot something so I went to peek.  
Bad idea.

Curtain 12 was moving.  
Not swaying from AC.  
Not like a breeze.  
More like someone brushing fingers down the back of the fabric, slow slow slow.  

I told myself it’s just my eyes.  
Night shift brain. Didn’t look.  Didn’t break the rule.

Then something whispered my name.  
Not loud.  Not angry. Sounded Just bored.  
Like someone trying it out to see how it sounded.

Sound came from behind the curtain.

I froze so hard my hand cramped around my badge lanyard.  
Curtain pulled inward just a little, like someone breathed in close to it.  
I swear I saw a shape through the cloth,
too tall for a patient,too still for anyone alive.

I legit wanted to run but the rule card said walk away slow.  
So I did.  
Felt like my whole spine was buzzing. didn’t look back.

When I reached the nurses’ station, the bed alarm that sent me there finally stopped.  
214 was empty.  
Nobody assigned to it for days.

This morning the charge nurse asked how my night was. i just said “all good.”  
She nodded like she already knew I was lying.  
Then she tapped the rule card and said, “Most ppl break Rule 4 once. You didn’t?”

I said no. she said good.  
Bc if you look directly thru that curtain, whatever’s behind it sees more than your face.

Don’t know what that means and honestly I don’t wanna.

My shift starts again in 20 minutes.  
Lights already flickering.

1p9cdnl,https://youtu.be/qs4IfQOdF8E,4 Very Scary TRUE Solo Night Urban Exploring Horror Stories,"# ""The Pipe Man"":

I decided to check out the old textile mill on the outskirts of Detroit one Friday after work. My usual buddies had plans, and I’d done plenty of short solo explores before, so I figured going alone wouldn’t be a big deal. The place had been abandoned since the late 80s—four stories of rusted machinery, collapsed rafters, and forgotten looms. Perfect for photos, perfect for a little adrenaline. I parked a block away around 10 p.m., grabbed my flashlight and backpack, and slipped through a gap in the sagging chain-link fence.

The main entrance had long been boarded shut, but a side door hung crookedly from its hinges. I eased it open, and the smell hit me first—dust, mildew, old oil soaked so deep into the concrete it felt alive. Every step forward made my shoes crunch on broken glass and scraps of metal. My flashlight cut through the dark, catching on piles of shredded cloth and scraps of thread curled like dried vines. The quiet felt thick, heavy, like the whole building was holding its breath.

I moved deeper into the mill, down a narrow hallway lined with crumbling offices. Paper littered the floor—yellowed invoices, timecards, hand-scribbled notes from people who had probably retired or died decades ago. A wall calendar still clung to a tack in one room, frozen at June 1987. On the dusty desk below it sat a rusted stapler, some pens fused together by grime, a cracked mug that still had a faint coffee ring inside it. None of it mattered, but all of it made that familiar thrill rise in my chest—the feeling that I was walking through a preserved moment in time.

Then something dropped. A soft thump further down the hall.

I froze, listening. Probably a rat. Or part of the ceiling giving up. Still, the sound nudged me back into alertness. I adjusted my grip on the flashlight and kept moving.

The factory floor opened up like an aircraft hangar—massive, silent machines sprawled across the concrete, looms hunched like metal skeletons waiting to be woken up again. Chains dangled from overhead beams, swaying slightly in the draft. Conveyor belts sagged under decades of dust. I climbed a narrow metal staircase to the upper level, wincing as each step groaned under my weight. Up on the catwalks, the whole place felt even more cavernous, my footsteps echoing above the lifeless rows of machines.

I leaned against the railing to take a couple photos, and that’s when I heard it again—this time a scrape, metal on concrete. Closer. Too close to be my imagination.

I called out, “Hello? Anyone here?”

My voice echoed back at me, swallowed by the dark. No answer.

I told myself it was just the building settling, but the hairs on my arms stood up. My pace slowed. My light swept the shadows like I expected something to leap out of them.

At the far end of the catwalk, I found a door leading into a cluster of storage rooms. I stepped inside and found crates stacked to the ceiling, some pried open with bolts of fabric spilling out like guts. In the corner was something that didn’t belong to the 1980s—something recent.

A filthy sleeping bag. Crushed food cans. A half-empty water bottle. My heartbeat crawled higher in my chest.

Someone was living here.

I took a step back, ready to turn around and leave quietly, when I noticed a notebook lying open beside the sleeping bag. Pages filled with tight, frantic scribbles. I raised my flashlight to read it—

A low mutter floated from behind a stack of crates.

Words. Muddled, sticky with anger.

“…get out… mine…”

I froze. My flashlight swept toward the voice.

A tall man stepped into the open, emerging from the shadows like he’d been part of them. His coat hung in tatters, grime smeared across his face, beard twisted and matted. His eyes were wild—too wide, too bright. In his hand, he held a length of rusted pipe like it belonged there.

My throat tightened. “What are you doing here?” I managed, trying to sound calm.

He tilted his head, lips peeling back in something that wasn’t quite a smile. “This is my place,” he rasped. “You… shouldn’t be here.”

“I didn’t know. I’m just exploring. I’ll leave right now.”

He stepped closer. The pipe dragged slightly across the floor. “Exploring… stealing… same thing. People come and take my things.” His gaze snapped to the notebook, then back to me. “You saw it. Can’t let you go now.”

My body reacted before my brain did—I turned and ran.

His footsteps pounded behind me, uneven but fast. “Come back!” he shouted, voice cracking. “We need to talk!”

The catwalk vibrated under my sprinting feet. My flashlight beam jerked wildly across rust and shadow. I hit the stairs too hard and my foot landed on something slick—oil, maybe. The world tilted. I tumbled down half the flight, smashing my knee against a step. Pain flared hot and sharp, but I scrambled upright and kept moving, limping, gasping.

From above, he shouted, “Where are you? I see your light!”

I ducked into a side room, full of old sewing machines, and snapped my flashlight off. The darkness swallowed me whole. I crouched behind a machine, forcing my breath shallow, quiet.

His footsteps clanged onto the lower floor. Slower now. Searching.

“I know you’re down there,” he crooned, voice sliding between sweet and furious. “We can share. You don’t have to hide… unless you’re trying to take something.”

Silence stretched, broken only by my heartbeat hammering in my ears. My knee throbbed, and warmth trickled down my leg—blood. Sweat dripped down my back in cold lines.

A door creaked.

He stepped into the room.

The scrape of the pipe against metal machines was louder this time. “Here…?” he said, tapping one machine. CLANG. “…or here?” Another clanging thud.

I tried to edge away in the dark. My hand brushed something sharp—broken metal or a snapped needle. It sliced straight into my palm. Pain flared white. I sucked in a breath, too loud.

He froze. “That you?”

The pipe slammed into a machine right beside me.

I bolted.

Flashlight back on, beam swinging just enough to guide me. He lunged behind me, pipe slicing the air so close I felt the wind of it.

“STOP!” he roared.

I ran blindly through the hallways, bouncing off walls, searching for the right exit. Panic made everything blur together. Then—finally—the side entrance door appeared through the dark. I slammed into it, burst out into the night air.

His hand closed around my backpack strap. “Got you!”

I twisted, yanking myself free as the strap tore. I sprinted across the lot, dove for the fence, scraped my arms climbing over, hit the ground running. I didn’t look back until I was in my car with the doors locked.

In the rearview mirror, he stood at the fence line, pipe dangling at his side, staring at me like he was memorizing my face.

I drove straight to the hospital. Told them I’d fallen while hiking. They stitched my hand, wrapped my knee, asked no further questions.

I never went back to that mill. And I don’t explore alone anymore.

Whatever that man was guarding in there, it belongs to him now. Forever.





# ""One Occupant"":

I’d always had this habit—slipping into forgotten places after the sun went down, just me, my flashlight, and whatever silence the city hadn’t already chewed up. Detroit was full of ghosts if you knew where to look, but that old textile mill on the outskirts… that one had been calling to me for weeks. Photos online showed rusted looms, collapsing rafters, walls peeling like old scabs. Perfect for exploring. Perfect for a little trouble.

I parked a block away behind a curtain of overgrown bushes, killed the engine, and let the night settle around me. The place loomed in the distance, wide and dark, like a sleeping animal. I walked the rest of the way in, boots crunching through gravel and dead leaves, until I reached the broken chain-link fence. A gap gaped wide enough to slip through.

Inside, the air changed immediately—thick with damp metal, mildew, the faint chemical sourness of fabric long rotted. My shoes crackled over scattered glass. Rows of huge, silent looms stood like rusted skeletons, draped in webs so thick they looked like abandoned shrouds. My flashlight beam skimmed old safety posters still clinging to the walls, their warnings faded into ghost-pale letters. *Protect Your Hands, Protect Your Future.*

The excitement hit first—the rush of stepping out of time, into somewhere the world had forgotten. I snapped a few photos, careful not to let my footsteps echo too loudly. But the deeper I pushed into the mill, the more things started feeling… wrong.

It was subtle at first. A crumpled blanket shoved into a corner. Empty food cans. A plastic bottle half-filled with murky water. Someone had been living here recently—*or was still living here.* I told myself it was just squatters, nothing new in a place like this, but my pulse ticked up a little. My flashlight felt suddenly too bright, so I kept it pointed low and moved quieter.

In the storage wing, that’s when I heard it.

A voice.

Low. Fractured. Like someone arguing with himself.

I froze, tilting my head. The words were blurred by distance and cracked by emotion, but the tone was sharp—angry, slipping into despair, then rising again. Something like: *“Not again… you can’t… leave me…”* The sound bled through the wall ahead. My muscles tensed. I knew I should turn back.

Instead, I inched forward, curiosity pulling me by the collar.

I reached the next doorway and killed my light. The room beyond was lit only by the faint flicker of a fire burning in a metal bucket. Crates and barrels crowded the edges. And in the middle of it all, a man sat hunched on the cold floor, thin and jittery, rocking back and forth. His clothes were filthy. His hands shook. Around him lay a rusty pipe, a broken bottle, a few other things that looked too much like weapons.

He muttered to himself in frantic loops. “They took it… took it all… but I’ll get it back, I will…”

A shiver crawled up my back. I stepped away, slow and careful—

—and my foot hit a loose board.

The crack echoed like a gunshot.

The man went rigid. His head snapped around, eyes wide and hollow, staring straight into the dark where I stood.

“Who’s there?” His voice was a jagged snarl. “I *know* you’re watching. Come out.”

I didn’t breathe. Didn’t shift. Just prayed he’d convince himself it was nothing.

Instead, he stood. Grabbed the pipe.

“You think you can sneak in here?” he barked, stepping toward the doorway. “This is *my* place!”

That broke the freeze. I backed away fast, pulse hammering, trying to remember the way out in the maze of rooms. Behind me, his footsteps hit the concrete—fast, angry.

“Hey! Get back here! You stole from me, didn’t you?”

I sprinted down a side corridor, my flashlight bouncing wildly. Papers scattered under my feet. Shadows sliced by moonlight from broken windows. I ducked into a room full of overturned desks and file cabinets, heart racing, and killed the light again. I crouched behind a stack of boxes, forcing my breaths to stay quiet.

His footsteps approached. Slower now. More deliberate.

“I see you…” he whispered into the darkness, almost coaxing. “Hiding like a rat. Come on out. We can talk.”

A metal scrape sliced the silence—the pipe dragging across the floor.

“You won’t leave like the others. You’ll stay. You’ll stay with me.”

He kicked aside debris, searching. Getting closer.

I shifted the smallest inch—and a loose sheet of paper crackled under my shoe.

He froze.

Then: “There you are.”

He lunged.

Instinct took over. I burst upward, knocking the boxes aside in a crashing avalanche. His swing missed my shoulder by inches, smashing into the wall with a vicious clang. I tore through the doorway and down a moonlit hall, lungs burning, his footsteps slamming behind me.

“You can’t run forever!” he shouted. “This mill is mine!”

A stairwell flashed into sight—leading down. Bad idea. No choice. I flew down the steps, wood splintering beneath me. The basement air hit like a wet slap—cold, thick, metallic. Pipes rattled overhead, dripping slow, rhythmic drops. My breathing echoed too loudly in the confined space.

He reached the top of the stairs.

“Down there?” he called. “You’re trapped now.”

I pushed deeper, weaving through boiler rooms, shadowy maintenance corridors, hulking shapes of machinery that looked alive in the dark. Finally, I spotted a narrow metal door. When I pulled it open, stale air puffed out of a small utility tunnel. I crawled inside, shoulder and knees scraping concrete.

Behind me, his voice drifted through the basement. “I can wait… you’ll come out eventually…”

I kept crawling, the tunnel tight and filthy, until it opened into another forgotten chamber. No footsteps. No voice. Just the rhythmic drip of water and the distant hum of the outside world.

Then, somewhere above—*CLANG.* Pipe hitting metal.

He was still searching.

I found an exit door half-buried behind debris. Rusted, but unlocked. I shoved through it and stumbled into the night air behind the mill. The overgrown lot swallowed me as I ran, heart in my throat, toward the fence. I squeezed through the gap and didn’t look back until I reached my car.

When I finally did—

A thin figure stood at the fence, a dark silhouette in the moonlight, watching me drive away.

He didn’t chase. He didn’t shout.

He just watched.

And something about that stare followed me long after the mill disappeared in my rearview.

I never explored alone again after that. The thrill had always felt worth the risk—until the night it wasn’t.





# ""The Voices"":

I decided to check out the old textile mill on the outskirts of Detroit one Friday evening after work, the kind of half-formed plan that sounded harmless when the sun was still out. The place had been abandoned since the late ’80s, long enough for it to fade into rumor—haunted by machines that still hummed at night, people said, or used as a hideaway for squatters and drifters. I’d seen photos online of rusted looms and collapsing walkways, and something about it pulled at me. My buddies were busy, but I’d done a handful of urbex spots alone before. I told myself it would be quick—get a few shots, walk the main floor, be back in my car before midnight.

I parked a block away, tucking my car behind some bushes where the streetlights didn’t quite reach. The cold air carried that late-autumn industrial smell—old brick, burned rubber, and something faintly metallic. I hopped the sagging chain-link barrier, the metal groaning under my weight, and slipped through a side door hanging crooked on rust-eaten hinges.

Inside, the darkness seemed to swallow sound. My flashlight cut a narrow path through dust that drifted like ash. The main floor stretched out into a cavern of forgotten machinery—loom frames, conveyor systems, carts loaded with fabric scraps that had long since lost their color. The faded safety posters on the walls peeled like dead skin, warning workers about hazards that no longer mattered. My footsteps echoed softly, each crunch of debris a reminder that no one had been here to clean this place in decades.

I wandered deeper, climbing a metal staircase that flexed just enough to make the hair on my arms stand up. The second floor looked like someone had flicked a switch and frozen time: desks overturned, chairs on their sides, papers strewn across the floor in brittle drifts. A calendar from 1987 curled on the wall. I took a few pictures, drawn by the eerie stillness that places like this always held—a kind of suspended breath.

A narrow hallway lined with dented lockers stretched ahead. As I walked toward it, a faint scrape echoed from the far end—metal dragging across concrete. I stopped, angled my light, and saw nothing but collapsed crates and shadow pools thick enough to hide a dozen things. Probably rats, I told myself. Or the building settling.

I kept exploring, checking rooms one by one. I ducked into what had once been a break area: vending machines with their glass fronts smashed, chairs rusted into place, graffiti sprayed across the walls in colors gone dull with time.

That’s when I heard it again—the scrape, closer now, followed by a low murmur. Not the wind. Not rodents. Voices. Two of them, too muffled to make out.

A little jolt ran through me. I pulled out my phone and texted my friend Alex quickly: “Inside the mill now. Weird noises. Probably just squatters.” His reply came back in seconds: “Seriously, be careful. If it feels sketchy, get out.”

The voices drifted again—soft, rough, indistinct. I stepped lighter, moving toward a wide storage area stacked with wooden pallets and old shipping crates. As I got closer, the murmur sharpened into words.

“No, that’s mine,” a man muttered, his voice slurred.  
“You took the last one.” Another voice, lower, irritated.

I froze. I eased behind a pallet, heartbeat hammering, and turned off my flashlight. The dark pressed in, but I didn’t dare risk being seen.

Footsteps shuffled. A sour smell crept through the room—cigarettes, sweat, clothes worn too long without washing. In the faint bluish glow from a broken window, I could make out two figures: one tall and gaunt, the other shorter with a thick, hunched frame. They were rummaging through a battered backpack, pulling out cans and bottles, arguing under their breath.

I shifted my weight, and my foot nudged a loose bolt. The tiny metallic clink felt impossibly loud.

The tall man’s head snapped up. “What was that?”

The shorter one grabbed something from the bag—something long, solid. A bat. “Someone’s in here,” he growled. “Hey! Come out. This is our spot.”

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

The tall one fished out a penlight and swept it lazily over the stacks of pallets. “I heard you. Don’t play games.”

The beam slid dangerously close to my hiding spot. I could feel the heat of adrenaline flushing through my body, muscles tensing for whatever was about to happen.

He took a step toward me. “I see you moving back there. Don’t make me drag you out.”

I knew staying silent would only make things worse. I forced my voice to stay even. “Hey. I’m just exploring. Didn’t know anybody was here. I’ll leave.”

The shorter man laughed, a harsh, ugly sound. “Exploring,” he repeated. “This ain’t a playground, kid. What you got on you? Wallet? Phone?”

The tall one flicked open a pocketknife, the blade catching a slice of reflected moonlight. “Hand it over,” he said, “and maybe we let you walk out.”

Panic flared hot and sharp. I didn’t think—I just ran.

I bolted out from behind the pallet, my shoes skidding on dust-coated concrete. “Hey!” the tall one yelled, lunging. The shorter one swung the bat, hitting a crate with a splintering crack.

I sprinted down the hallway, my breath burning in my chest. Their footsteps pounded after me. A bottle flew past my ear and exploded against the wall, spraying shards—one slicing a thin line across my forearm. I barely felt it.

Down the stairwell. Two steps at a time. Nearly tripped. Caught myself on the railing. Footsteps still behind me, closer.

I hit the ground floor and veered hard left toward the side exit. I could hear them shouting—threats, curses—but the words blurred into pure fear-fuel.

I slammed through the side door and burst into the cold night air. I didn’t look back. I sprinted toward the fence, muscles screaming, lungs burning. I scrambled up the chain-link, fingers slipping, then threw myself over the top and hit the ground hard on the other side.

Their voices echoed faintly behind me: “You’re lucky this time!”

I didn’t stop running until I reached my car. My hands were shaking so badly I fumbled the keys twice before I got the door open. I peeled out, heart thudding like it wanted to escape my chest.

Later that night, I made an anonymous report to the police. They said the mill was known for transients and was nearly impossible to keep secure.

I never went exploring alone again. Not after hearing how close danger can breathe down your neck in a place the rest of the city has already forgotten.





# ""No Witnesses"":

I had this habit—some people would call it reckless, others would call it stupid—of wandering into forgotten places after the city went quiet. Midnight always made the empty spaces feel different, like they exhaled once everyone else was asleep. Old factories, crumbling warehouses, locked-up office buildings with shattered windows and peeling paint. Places that were once loud and alive but now felt like fossils of another time. I didn’t go with friends. I liked the solitude, the way silence settled on my shoulders like a heavy coat.

The textile mill on the edge of Detroit had been sitting in the back of my mind for weeks. I’d seen grainy photos online: rusted looms, spinning frames coated in dust, dim hallways where the only light came from beams broken through the roof. People said it had been shut down since the early 80s. Some said the owners left in a hurry, others whispered about accidents and cover-ups. I never cared about the stories—just the thrill.

One Friday night, just past 11 p.m., I decided it was time. I parked a block away behind a wall of overgrown shrubs, grabbed my flashlight, my phone, a bottle of water, and slipped my backpack on. The sidewalks were empty, streetlights buzzing like they were straining to stay awake. When I reached the property, the front gate was padlocked with a chain thick enough to anchor a ship. But the fence beside it bowed inward, a narrow slit where someone had cut through years ago. I pushed in sideways, feeling the rough metal snag my jacket and pull at my sleeve.

The air inside was colder, heavier. It smelled like damp cloth, old dust, and something metallic that stung the back of my throat. The silence wasn’t complete—there were distant drips, the scrape of something loose shifting upstairs, the faint whisper of wind slipping through cracks. My footsteps echoed across the concrete floor as I swept my flashlight over the main hall. The machines were enormous, hulking silhouettes frozen mid-motion, like giants interrupted mid-breath. Strands of thread still hung from some of them, swaying gently in the draft, casting thin trembling shadows on the walls.

I took my time moving through the space, letting the atmosphere wrap around me. It was the kind of place where your own imagination turned shadows into shapes, shapes into figures. A trick of the dark, I told myself. Just a trick of the dark.

A rusted stairwell led to the second floor. The steps creaked loud enough to make my skin prickle, every thud echoing through the building like a warning. The hallway upstairs stretched long and narrow, lined with doors barely clinging to their hinges. I ducked into a room that looked like it used to be an office—metal desks overturned, filing cabinets collapsed on their sides, papers decaying in dusty piles. I knelt and picked up a faded memo. Production quotas. March 1984. A handwriting note in the corner: *Behind schedule again.* It was like the whole place had been paused mid-sentence.

That’s when I heard it.

A low murmur drifting through the hall. Too soft to understand but too familiar to be the wind. Human. I froze, breath caught halfway up my throat, straining to separate the sound from the building’s natural groans. It came again—two voices, faint, blurred, like they were buried beneath layers of distance.

My first thought was other explorers. Teenagers maybe, or photographers. My second thought—the one that tightened every muscle in my spine—was that it wasn’t that kind of murmur. There was weight in it. Intent.

I clicked off my flashlight and waited for my eyes to adjust. The dark softened, revealing a faint glimmer at the end of the hall. I moved slowly, quiet as I could, feet rolling carefully over broken tiles. The closer I got, the clearer the voices became.

They were coming from a room at the very end. A bigger room—maybe a break lounge once, now littered with overturned tables and broken plastic chairs. I hugged the wall and leaned just far enough to peek inside.

Two figures sat crouched near a shattered window. The only light came from a small lantern on the floor, its flame shivering in the draft. One man was tall, gaunt, shadows sinking into the hollows of his cheeks. The other was shorter, bundled in a hooded jacket so tightly I couldn’t see much of his face. Between them sat two large duffel bags, sides bulging.

I should’ve left right then. Walked backwards, quiet as a ghost. But adrenaline has a way of making you bolder than you should be. I crept behind a stack of wooden crates, close enough to hear their words clearly.

“You sure no one pokes around here?” the tall one asked, his voice sandpaper rough.

“This place is a grave,” the shorter one muttered with a laugh. “Been using it for weeks. Only rats care.”

He reached into a bag and pulled out a small packet. Even in the dim lantern glow, the white powder was unmistakable. My pulse started hammering. Hard.

“Last batch moved quick,” the short one said. “But that guy downtown? He’s playing games.”

The tall one’s expression changed—sharpened. “If he doesn’t pay, we deal with it. Same as last time.”

*Last time.*  
That phrase stuck in my brain like a hook.

I leaned in, trying to see what else was in the bags. A loose crate edge scraped beneath my hand. The faintest sound—but enough.

Both men snapped their heads toward me.

“You hear that?” the tall one hissed.

“Rats,” the short one said at first. But his hand dove into the duffel and came up gripping something metallic. A knife. A big one.

The tall man stood slowly. “Check it out anyway.”

Panic surged through me like cold water. I stayed still, barely breathing, as the short man began walking toward my hiding place. Each step felt like a countdown. When he got within maybe ten feet, my heel nudged a loose board. It groaned.

“There!” the tall one roared. “Someone’s here!”

I exploded into motion.

I sprinted down the hallway, not even thinking, just running. My flashlight bounced uselessly in my hand, so I let it fall. Behind me: pounding footsteps, shouts, curses.

“Grab him!”  
“Don’t let him get out!”

I threw myself into the nearest room, slammed the door, shoved a desk against it. The door shook instantly with their weight.

“Open it!”  
“You made a big mistake, kid!”

I scanned the room desperately. No back door. No trapdoor. No—

The window.

The boards over it were old, brittle. I ripped at them with shaking hands, splinters biting into my skin. The last board broke and the window gave way. Broken glass sliced my palm, warm blood streaking across the sill. I squeezed through, dropped hard.

My ankle buckled with a pop. Pain shot up my leg so sharp I almost screamed. But the shouts behind me lit a fire under every nerve. I limped, half-ran, stumbling over weeds and debris.

They burst out a side exit, lantern light scanning wildly.

“Where is he?”  
“He couldn’t’ve gotten far!”  
“Find him—no witnesses!”

I crouched behind a rusted truck carcass, hands trembling, breath shaking so loud I had to clamp my jaw shut. The tall one passed close—close enough that I could hear his breathing, low and furious. His knife glinted as he moved it from hand to hand.

“Come out,” he whispered. “We just wanna talk.”

A lie so thin it might as well have been smoke.

I waited, seconds stretching into lifetimes, until their voices drifted farther away. Then I crawled to the fence, slipped through the gap so fast I scraped my shoulder raw, and ran.

My keys slipped twice before I managed to unlock the car door. I threw myself inside, started the engine, and tore away from the curb like something was still chasing me. I didn’t slow down for miles. Only when my hands stopped shaking enough for me to hold the wheel steady did I finally pull over, chest heaving, sweat cold on my skin.

I didn’t go back to places like that after that night. The thrill wasn’t worth hearing those footsteps behind me again—or imagining what would’ve happened if I’d been a second slower.

But sometimes, when it’s late and the world is too quiet, I still think about that mill. About the men inside. About what they heard, what they saw. And I wonder if somewhere out there, they remember that night too. If they ever think about the stranger who almost saw too much. If they ever went looking.

And when I hear something in my apartment at 2 a.m.—a floorboard settling, a faint creak—I lie awake and hold my breath, just to make sure the footsteps aren’t coming back for me.",1,1764380715.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Ideally trying to find a spot not too far away from Manhattan or in Manhattan. My budget is flexible, but aiming for somewhere between $1,600 and $2,600. I’d love in-unit laundry if possible, but definitely need it in the building at least.

I used to work in FAANG but quit to do my own startup. I’m pretty reserved, cook sometimes, love coffee and trying new places! I’ll be working in coworking areas like WeWork or cafes most of the day.

I am 27, female, 5'5'', 165lbs, not on any meds, started smoking this year (started socially but now probably at a pack every 1.5 weeks)

Last week I had a scary incident where my hands seized into fists and I could not move them for 5 minutes. Events leading to:

\-Sick for the last two weeks, possibly Bronchitis (did not go to doctor until I was able to get out of bed so symptoms mostly resolved, but his guess was I just finished fighting it)

\-The day of the incident I went to work (out of sick leave days)

\-Way home I decided to take an Uber because I was not feeling well. Heart was pounding hard from the 11 minute walk from my office to the bus station (watch said 140bpm at one point), was very short of breath.

\-In Uber I started feeling warm and nauseous, rolled the window down. I often get car sick so used to this feeling. Especially when I had nothing to eat that day.

\-Oh ya, had nothing to eat all day! Besides one venti coffee and a really cheap protein shake (300cal). Haven't been able to buy groceries because sick and also had the bright idea of counting calories/dieting while I had all this free time being sick. This was my most extreme day for sure.

\-Started feeling really faint, experienced tingling in my hands. Tried to call roommate to ask him to feed me as soon as I got through the door. But as I was using my phone my hands started curling up into fists against my will. I tried to fight it but I could not. Dropped phone, panicked.

\-Asked Uber to take me to the hospital, he called 911 for an ambulance, they advised him to drive me to the hospital. 911 also advised me not to eat or drink anything as it may make me sick.

\-Hands were curled up, crazy tingling feeling, for 5 minutes. Regained function but they were very shaky for like 15 minutes after and a little shaky for hours later.

\-The blood tests at the ER were inconclusive. They could not confidently explain why it happened. Possibly low blood glucose(?) could have caused this. But after reading the doctors notes I realized she misunderstood and wrote that I was only coming in for a tingling sensation in hands. She was interrupted during my consultation to attend a more urgent matter and left for an additional 20 minutes in the middle of my story so I fear she missed some context.

\-Why I am stressing: no answers is weird! I feel like if the blood work is inconclusive they should dive deeper? Secondly, My Aunty and her son both have MS, and I am terrified this is an early sign of myself having MS. I did tell the doc but she said I wasn't showing any other neurological symptoms...

\-FYI I am trying to contact my family doc, called office at start of week but still nothing...

TLDR; So I want to know, can your hands actually curl up into involuntary fists for 5 minutes from low blood sugar or low anything, caused by not eating all day? But why would the blood work not reflect this? If it's simply a lack of food I would be so so relieved...",1,1764380477.0,AskDocs,6,0.67,False

1p9c73c,https://i.redd.it/7jpvcqp2o34g1.jpeg,D.C. police to begin patrolling with National Guard after fatal attack,"November 28, 2025 at 4:12 p.m. EST
By Jenny Gathright, Emily Davies and Olivia George

National Guard troops patrolling in D.C. will be paired with local law enforcement personnel, at least temporarily, in the wake of the Wednesday attack that killed one troop and critically injured another, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post and two D.C. police officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss planning that is still in progress.

""Officers will conduct high-visibility patrols with the National Guard and provide assistance as needed,” said the email, which was sent to D.C. police leadership Wednesday evening. The email said the situation was “fluid,” and adjustments to the staffing plan could be made in the coming days.

If enacted on a long-term basis, the change would significantly shift the way National Guard troops have worked with local and federal law enforcement in the District since their arrival in August. Trump administration officials have credited the troops for helping reduce crime in the city — in part, they argued, because the troops’ presence at Metro stations and on National Park Service lands frees up law enforcement to police other areas of the city. Diverting local police to accompany Guard members would do essentially the opposite by siphoning them from other tasks in D.C. neighborhoods.

The email said the new pairing would start Thursday and Friday. A D.C. police official said some officers had been temporarily detailed to accompany the troops, and a more long-term policy change was under discussion.

The official, who stressed that the discussions were still preliminary, said D.C. police, Metro Transit Police, U.S. Park Police and several other law enforcement agencies were having conversations with the National Guard task force in D.C. about pairing the troops with police officers while they are on city streets. Since their deployment to D.C., groups of National Guard troops have largely operated unaccompanied by police, the official said.

The policy change would bolster protection for the approximately 2,000 National Guard members deployed to the District as part of President Donald Trump’s “Safe and Beautiful Task Force,” who are not required to have the same law enforcement training as city police officers.

A D.C. police spokesperson did not confirm the shift in policy but said in a statement that “law enforcement agencies across Washington, DC, including the Metropolitan Police Department, are working in close coordination with the National Guard to ensure the safety of our community.”

The Guard’s continued presence in the city remains the subject of litigation. D.C. Attorney Brian Schwalb (D) sued the Trump administration over the deployment in September, seeking the troops’ withdrawal from the city and describing their presence as an illegal “military occupation” that increased the risk of deadly encounters between residents and troops. Trump administration lawyers said in court that the risk of a deadly encounter was “totally speculative.”

“There have actually been fewer deadly encounters because the National Guard has been here, allowing a surge of resources,” Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the Trump administration, said in an October hearing.

Earlier this month, a judge said the deployment was illegal and ordered that it be halted as the lawsuit continues in court. But the judge paused her order from going into effect until Dec. 11 to give the administration time to appeal. The administration has since asked an appeals court to allow the D.C. mission to continue, requesting a ruling on an emergency basis by Dec. 4 and excoriating the judge’s order as a “wholly unjustified incursion into the territory of both the President and Congress.”

Still, in internal memos, officials have acknowledged the risks associated with the deployment since its inception.

“The Make D.C. Safe and Beautiful Mission presents an opportunity for criminals, violent extremists, issue motivated groups and lone actors to advance their interests,” reads an internal document from D.C. National Guard leadership made public through Schwalb’s lawsuit. The document, which outlined the deployment’s objectives, was dated Aug. 12, the day after the president declared a crime emergency in the city.

A second memo, dated Aug. 28, warned service members that “those inspired by foreign terrorist organizations” might view the mission as a target. That same day, a member of the D.C. National Guard asked D.C. police for increased patrols in areas where troops are staying.

“Service members are being harassed at these hotels,” he wrote in the email reviewed by The Washington Post. Court records said local law enforcement agreed to increase patrols and troops were instructed to take measures to protect themselves, including always using the “buddy system” and changing into civilian clothes when off duty.

In the aftermath of this week’s fatal attack, Trump administration officials have doubled down on the need for the troops in the city. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said within hours of the shooting that Trump had asked him to add 500 troops to the D.C. mission, adding that the shooting had “stiffen[ed] our resolve to ensure that we make Washington, D.C. safe and beautiful.”

Asked Thursday whether he would take any additional security measures for National Guard troops in the city, Trump replied, “No, just I want to have more.”

The troops were visibly accompanied by D.C. police on Thanksgiving Day. After a news conference Thursday at U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro’s office, a group of four National Guard members were patrolling with a single D.C. police officer near Seventh Street and Indiana Avenue in Northwest Washington. They got coffee together at a nearby Starbucks, then walked northbound on Seventh Street.

As they strolled, a staff member from Pirro’s office walking in the opposite direction said, “I’m sorry, guys.” Other pedestrians called out apologies as the group patrolled together.

As my next trip gets closer I’m feeling a bit less stressed because I think I have strong proof of ties to Canada but I still want to ease my nerves a bit more. I’m a full-time student, I’ve already paid my January tuition to print out, I have an enrollment letter, my return ticket, Airbnb reservation, bank statement from a few months ago, and an investment. This year I’ve spent around 55 days in the U.S. over three visits, and I’m planning another four-week trip going into the new year. I will be coming back a week after my first class starts. These are 3 of my main concerns:

1. I-94 and fingerprints. I’ve heard people say that stays over 30 days trigger extra requirements. On my last visit by plane (automatic I-94) I told the officer I’d be staying until a certain date but my partner and I got sick so the trip ended up being a full month (about 5 extra days or so). I used Mobile Passport Control and I don’t remember being fingerprinted. From what I'm reading, they're saying if it's over 30 days and/or land, but I'm not sure if it applies to me and if it is me if they're going to give me issues next time becuz of the last trip.
2. Part of how I fund trips other than what I've saved up from past job is a tiny bit of YouTube income. I’m under 10k subscribers and the AdSense/donations are basically coffee money and some months I could see less than a $500 deposit in my acc. However, my concern is that if they ask for my bank statement and they see 'Google deposit' they will question and wonder if I am filming videos in the US (or working).
3. My boyfriend has DACA and can’t travel to Canada, so I’m the one visiting more often. Some people even note that it can reduce suspicion because he can’t sponsor me, so it weakens any argument that im trying to immigrate improperly. Not sure if this is relevant or if they could ask what kind of job he has.

After this next trip, I’ll be around halfway to the 180-day limit, but I don’t plan to travel as much in 2026. I feel mostly okay, just wanted to ease my nerves and make sure none of these things would raise red flags.",0,1764379972.0,uscanadaborder,1,0.4,False

We'll see if we'll be out there again tomorrow. To my great surprise a package still arrived on our doorstep.

My tiredness and needing to go out and deal with the snow did take away from my writing productiveness. I wrote 590 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. I also made a few more touch ups on my painting. It isn't as much as I wanted to get done but given I am now struggling to keep my eyes open, I have to be content with what I did have the energy to do.

A few other small anecdotes before I go make myself a coffee. The birds were adorable out there. They were flying from our evergreen bushes to our feeders and back all day. I took so many pictures of them; finches, juncos, our favourite cardinal couple, and so many chickadees. They were so wonderful and pretty out in the snow snacking that I had the urge to paint the scene so I tried to get as many reference shots as possible. Also, darling called. We now have plans on December 18 to go to a little christmas concert of Peanuts songs. It will be good to see them though I know on the day off I'll be dreading going out. You know how I am.

Now, I am in desperate need of a coffee. I sincerely hope we all get to bed at a reasonable time tonight.

Hey everyone, so I’m here with an update. Before I got into how the talk with my fiance’s parents went, I want to answer some questions that a lot of people kept asking:

1.      Why didn’t I tell his parents myself about my parents and Rose? This was a deceent point. While I still don’t believe it is my fault for what occurred, I did understand the POV that this was MY situation, MY family, and it’s something at minimum we should’ve done together. I guess when it comes to situations like this, people’s parents finding out about my own, usually friends, they just do it for me. It’s not something I ask them to do, they usually ask me permission before our families meet and I say yes. I thought it’d be easier if my fiancé told them before our arrival so it wasn’t just me word vomiting “Hi, nice to finally meet you! By the way, my parents are in a polycule.” But, looking back, yes, I can acknowledge, I should’ve offered to tell them as a couple. That being said, if he felt that uncomfortable doing it alone, I wish he would have told me.

2.      Do his parents think my parents and Rose are related? I feel really stupid for not thinking about this at the time. In my family, “aunt” is a term used loosely. It doesn’t mean “parent’s sister”. I have a lot of “aunts” and “uncles” that aren’t related to my parents biologically but were close, influential figures in my life, thus the titles. So, when I found out they assumed Rose was an “aunt”, my mind just went to “family friend”, but Jesus Christ…realizing they probably thought this was a Flowers In The Attic type situation, no shit they freaked out! I feel dumb for not even considering this.

3.      Some have said that this situation is unusual and even if they don’t assume this is a Folger’s coffee holiday commercial, it’s natural that they may need a minute to process, or that they may never accept it at all. Many asked about religious or cultural reasons. His family isn’t religious nor do they come from a conservative culture. That being said, I can understand why this is odd to people, and why they may need a minute or have a hard time accepting it, even without those things. I think I just got protective of my parents and Rose in the moment, especially seeing how hurt my mom was in that moment. Yes, she’s “used to it”, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t sting when you are rejected. We’re all human. At the end of the day, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I am also entitled to my feelings. I totally understand not everyone will accept my family. That doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to be hurt by it. If I can’t police anyone else’s feelings, that goes two-fold.

4.      Someone asked “What if you never found a partner who accepted this? Or what if you never found a partner who’s family did?” And the truth is, I don’t need their family to accept it. Just be respectful. A for a partner, I thought I had found one who was, and even if I never did…well, I’d rather have my family any day.  

Anyway, onto the update. As per point #2, I realized the context they were lacking may be playing a part. So, early this morning, I texted and asked if we could meet up and talk. They were all for it. I went without my fiancé, as we still weren’t really talking. We met for breakfast and the first thing I asked was for them to give their side. As most of you expected, the weirdness and judgement they were giving was because they assumed Rose was my mom’s sister. They actually seemed relieved when I explained the whole story and are supportive. They want to properly re-meet my family, which I said was sweet. I didn’t want to get into the whole “I don’t know where your son and I stand” as that wasn’t their problem.

 

However, his mom did clarify “So, (fiance’s name) knew the real story this whole time and lied?” I was honest and said yes. I said maybe I should’ve made sure he actually told them, but his dad actually interrupted and said if he promised to tell them, then it was on \*him\* to say it. They were both very disappointed in him. They actually said what a lot of you did, even if he lied for all this time, he should’ve spoken up when things got awkward and smoothed out the situation. Or even grabbed me to. They felt even worse, but I told them it wasn’t their fault. Given the context of the situation, I don’t blame them for acting weir. The meeting ended on a positive note. We were all supposed to have lunch later on, but given everything with my fiancé, I didn’t feel great about going, so I had him go alone. I told his parents ahead of time, and they understood.

 

When fiancé came back from the lunch, he apologized. He said he wasn’t sure how to tell them and kept meaning to. He also kept hoping it would “naturally come up”. I pointed out it wasn’t that he just didn’t tell them, he actively lied. Of course they never suspected Rose was anything more than an aunt in my stories, because that’s the lie he planted. He was sincere in his apology. But then he mentioned he got a tongue thrashing from his parents, and I wonder if he would’ve apologized had they not told him what a jerk he was.

I said I understood if he felt weird about telling them, but he should’ve told me. We could’ve navigated shit together. Instead, he let it explode, then did 0 to help clean it up nor did he take accountability until mommy and daddy scolded him. He made my parents and Rose look bad, made me look even worse, and most importantly: he lied to me and his parents for 2.5 years. How am I supposed to trust him again about anything? I listed some of the examples you guys gave. He got quiet and said he understood, but he wanted to rebuild the trust. I asked if he was really okay with my family dynamic and he insisted he is. He says he loves my family and really has no issues, he just didn’t know how to tell them. I said I want to believe him, but you can never fully trust a liar again. He asked what we could do to fix this. I said I needed time. He offered counseling and I said I’d consider it.

We had started planning our wedding a few weeks ago, but that has been put on hold indefinitely. I had been living with him since the engagement but I’m back with my parents and Rose for now. I have to decide if this is something I can live with going forward. It’s only been a few hours, so I genuinely have no idea if I can forgive him for this and move on. One person said “Hopefully this’ll be a funny story one day, remember the Thanksgiving where your parents didn’t know who Rose was?” And I don’t even know if I could ever get there. I love him. I thought he was my person. I don’t want to throw it all away, but I need space. If we move forward with the relationship, we will absolutely be going to counseling. I told him even if we break up and I don’t go, he needs to enter therapy for his conflict avoidance. He didn’t disagree. He also called my parents and Rose to apologize. They were civil, but I know they are not happy. Fiance’s parents, however, have invited them out to a do-over dinner before they head back to the west coast, and with my blessing, they’re going. It’ll be nice if they can be friends after all this.

That’s where we are. Everything is so fresh and I still don’t know what I want yet. Going to take the holidays to reset and rethink about a lot. Thanks for all the advice.",78,1764379915.0,AITAH,29,0.93,False

Been living in Japan for about two years now, working typical salaryman hours. Was drinking maybe 4-5 coffees a day just to stay functional, sleeping like absolute rubbish, constantly wired but also somehow exhausted. Classic combo.

Finally went to the doctor about it last month because I was properly struggling. Doc took one look at my daily routine and basically said ""mate, you're overdoing the caffeine, your cortisol's probably through the roof, and you're not actually helping yourself.""

Suggested switching to Japanese green tea instead, specifically mentioned genmaicha because it's got barely any caffeine but still gives you something warm to drink. Was skeptical honestly  thought it was typical ""just relax"" advice that doesn't actually work.  
Grabbed some organic stuff from  and gave it a proper go. First week was rough (caffeine withdrawal headaches), but after that? Honestly night and day difference. Sleeping properly for the first time in months, not getting those afternoon crashes, way less anxious.

Turns out green tea's got all this stuff like L-theanine that actually helps with focus without making you jittery, plus antioxidants and whatever else. Doc explained the science behind it but I was half asleep during that part.

Anyone else made a similar switch? Feel like I wasted two years being a caffeinated zombie when I could've just drunk proper tea like a normal person.",6,1764379602.0,ANormalDayInJapan,0,0.88,False

I will be flying into Mexico City on December 18th and am planning to stay in the country for up 6 months. I have my first 4 weeks free and was wondering where people would suggest spending the the holiday season and beyond. After that, I will be teaching Yoga for a few weeks in Merida and then will be free again for the remainder of the time. I'm looking to do more exchanges and stuff like that while balancing traveling over that timeframe. My initial debate though has been whether to get an airbnb for a month in Mexico City, a month in Oaxaca or a month in Puerto Escondido to start. Or as a first timer, does it make more sense to bop around those few places for like 7-10 days to get more of a sense of what resonates with me. Its tempting to just book a place for a month for like $300 but the feeling of being locked in for that entire time makes me hesitate. I'm a 34 year-old male, active, love being by the beach whether it be walking or surfing, huge fan of coffee and food exploration, not a big party guy or drinker but enjoy being around night life and just walking around a lively area on a regular basis. I also wanted to sign up for Spanish lessons and found a few great schools in CDMX and Oaxaca.

1p9byds,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Icy-Bid-8593/comments/1p9byds/gratitude_speech/,Gratitude speech,"Find Something to Be Grateful For: A Speech Outline
I. The Hook: The Power of Perspective
Acknowledge the Audience/Current Moment: ""Good evening/morning everyone. As we gather here today/tonight, I want us to take a collective deep breath.""
The Struggle is Real: ""It's easy, sometimes almost automatic, to focus on the things that are hard. The deadlines we missed, the bills that piled up, the expectations that weighed us down.""
The Shift in Focus: ""But today, I want to challenge that automatic response. I want us to consciously and deliberately shift our focus to something ancient, powerful, and utterly transformative: gratitude.""
II. The Core Message: Gratitude as a Tool
Gratitude is Not Blind Optimism: ""Let me be clear: Gratitude is not about pretending everything is perfect. It is not about dismissing genuine hardship. It is about recognizing that even in the midst of the storm, there are beams of sunshine.""
The Daily Practice: ""Gratitude is a muscle. If you don't use it, it atrophies. The secret isn't waiting for a grand, life-changing moment to be grateful. The secret is finding the small things that happen every single day.""
III. The Three Pillars of Gratitude (Specific Examples)
Pillar 1: People & Connection
Focus: The human beings who make life meaningful.
Example/Prompt: ""Think about the person who sent you a text just when you needed it. The colleague who stayed late to help you finish a project. The quiet, consistent love of a parent, a child, or a friend. The connections we share are the bedrock of our happiness.""
Actionable Step: Challenge the audience to mentally or physically thank someone.
Pillar 2: Presence & The Moment
Focus: The simple, often-overlooked comforts of everyday life.
Example/Prompt: ""Are you grateful for the mug of hot coffee or tea you had this morning? For the roof over your head tonight? For the song that came on the radio that made you smile? These aren't minor details; they are the texture of a life well-lived.""
Actionable Step: Encourage the audience to find one sensory thing they appreciate right now.
Pillar 3: Progress & The Future
Focus: Gratitude for the struggles that taught us lessons, and the hope for what's next.
Example/Prompt: ""Let's be grateful for the mistakes we made, because they showed us a better way forward. Be grateful for the courage you had yesterday, and the promise of the strength you will have tomorrow. Gratitude is the fuel for persistence.""
Actionable Step: Ask the audience to acknowledge one past challenge that made them stronger.
IV. Conclusion: The Call to Action
Summary: ""So, as we leave this place and re-enter the busy world, let's not wait for the big miracle. Let's start with the small ones.""
Final Challenge: ""I challenge you tonight to do one simple thing before your head hits the pillow: Find three specific things you are grateful for. Not vague ideas, but specific moments, people, or comforts from your day.""
The Result: ""When you practice this, you will find that gratitude isn't just something you feel; it's something you create. And that creation has the power to change not just your day, but the entire landscape of your life.""",1,1764379457.0,u_Icy-Bid-8593,0,1.0,False

1p9buzd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9buzd,Rollers Bakery Northcote,"Inspired by this subreddit I ventured to Rollers on Northcote Rd this morning.

Beautiful morning so was expecting it to be very busy but multiple spare carparks directly in front. Most clientele seemed to be dads taking their young kids bike riding with a bakery stop on the way. Very wholesome. My icy heart was warmed. Sensible idea having small meat savouries for kids rather than whole pies. 

Staff were incredibly pleasant, a couple of dudes who seemed like you’d run into them at the beach later on in the arvo. 

Had a mince, cheese and jalapeño pie (c$7) . 
My review: Excellent sturdiness to the pie - did not fall apart at all even being eaten one handed. The pastry was perfectly crunchy and flaky on top (with a noticeable crunch when you bit into it) and soft but not soggy on bottom. Nice bits of jalapeño in there but even better was the mince mixture seemed infused with jalapeño flavour so you didn’t just get the heat when you bit into a piece but rather it was omnipresent. Cheese was present but not to the extent that it was gluggy or coated your teeth unpleasantly. Nice bit of baked cheese on top too. 

Husband’s review: Excellent. 

Also got a jam and cream donut. 
My review: lovely fluffy dough. Often these large donuts can get quite bready, tough or stale feeling but this was very light. It was jam packed with filling but not such that it overwhelmed the dough - you still got a solid doughnut. A bit of filling spilled out the bottom and it was a delight in itself. The jam was delicious and tasted like it was made in house (I don’t know if it was) and very generous. It had a strong berry flavour but had a tartness to it that meant you weren’t overwhelmed with sugary sweet. Cream was solid. Love jam and cream. What more can I say. I’m a happy little lad(ess) with berries and cream. 

Husband’s review: didn’t even get a bite. 

Also got a berry and pistachio danish.

I’m not a danish person so this was the husband’s time to contribute a few meaningful words:

Possibly the best danish he’s ever had.

Why? The pastry was crispy and flaky and not burnt. It didn’t dry out and handled being in a paper bag and left in the car while the dog was walked. There was a large amount of custard that didn’t taste artificial or overly sweet. The full and proper berries and pistachios were generous. 

Having just said I am not a danish person I did sneak some bites when he wasn’t looking and can say it was really good for a danish. Who is the person of few words now? (Me, the ladess with berries and cream). 

Also got some iced coffees. Standard iced coffee like you could get at a million other places. Nothing special but I wasn’t upset - I was here for the baking. Perfectly acceptable.

In all if I was a tradie working on the construction site over the road my arteries would be in danger. Can’t remember what everything else cost but whole thing came out to about $30 for five things so on average $6 each. No misses. Please excuse the photos of half eaten food balanced on my knees I have ADHD and am a goldfish (with berries and cream).

But I went into work today, and it was supposed to be a 10 hour midday shift (literally my most hated shifts)

In the car ride to work, it dawned on me that I forgot to eat breakfast and that all I had this morning was coffee, so I just hoped I could make it through the day, since in the past, this behavior has lead to me sugar crashing and getting sent home. I'm also not a diagnosed diabetic, if one at all, so there's not much I can do about it when it starts to happen except tell someone that it's happening

Sure enough, I clock in, I put my gloves on, and I can already feel my heart racing and it's getting hard to breathe. I tell a manager that I think I'm crashing and she lets me off the line to eat some of my lunch and we hope that's that. Nope.

My heart starts racing again and I actually drop to my knees while someone comes over to take over my station for me

Now, this is where the title comes in. During all of this, where I feel like shit, I'm literally on the verge of passing out at work, and for some reason my brain goes:

""Oh, Dionysus was described as *'hedonistic,'* in that thing I read about him... What does hedonistic mean?""

No idea why I was thinking about that while trying to maintain consciousness in a restaurant kitchen, but after my manager told me to go home and I clocked out, I did look up what it meant. It just means someone that prioritizes pleasure.

I also crashed again and almost passed out in the car, but I made it home, I rested, ate a little, and made an offering to Asclepius for help that I asked him for last week (also at work when I felt bad), and apologized for delivering it a week later when I had originally intended to give it that same night after I got home

Not for anything super dramatic we just weren't going to work out long term and it was best to move on. My best friend (26M) has been living in my apartment with me rent free. He's my best friend and he doesn't make enough to move out of his parents so I figured I'd help him get out into the world. A week after the breakup, he tells me he ran into my ex outside his work. A week after that, he tells me he ran into her again outside his work and asked if I'd be ok with him getting coffee with her strictly as friends nothing more. I thought this was strange because he'd been against the relationship from the start and very vocal about what he thought about her. Assured that it wouldn't go any further than coffee I confusedly agreed. On Sunday that weekend, he went home to spend the day with his parents. For context, we grew up on the same street not far away from the apartment. I went home later that day to see my parents. When I came home, my mom and his mom were on the porch. His mom said she hadn't seen him all day. Confused, I later went back to my place. My best friend has no other friends, doesn't date, doesn't have hobbies outside our place, and doesn't go anywhere. Puzzled about where he was, I followed the one piece of information I had that might explain his whereabouts: the chance encounter with my ex. At 8PM I drove by my ex's apartment complex confident that I wouldn't find my best friend there. His car was parked 100ft from her front door and stayed there all night. When he came home the next morning, he started telling me about this incredible day he had with his aunt yesterday which sounded EXACTLY like my ex-gfs picture perfect date. I immediately confronted him and asked him how long he'd been sleeping with my ex. He acted confused and denied it. I lied to him and told him I knew where he was every second of the day yesterday and he completely folded. Said he'd made out with her and cuddled with her and that, whether I believed it or not, he slept on the couch in her apartment last night and not in her bed. Not believing a word, I furiously kicked him out of my apartment. Not because he slept with my ex, but because he lied to my face about it. His mother was furious about it and she made it known to me. My parents don't fully understand why I did what I did. AITA?",1,1764378734.0,AITAH,5,0.99,False

As the title says I'm looking for recommendations for a large coffee table book centered around Pompeii, with lots of pictures of the ruins rather than artistic representations of the city, and if possible something more recent/would have photos of the most recent excavations? It's a gift for my nephew who watched Pompeii: The New Dig and he's obsessed now! He already has Houses and Monuments of Pompeii so I'm looking for something a little different.

If anyone has any suggestions it would be deeply appreciated! ",2,1764378605.0,ancientrome,0,1.0,False

Coconut vanilla
Pumpkin spice cake

Melozio

Pods I hate (if this helps) 
Pistachio vanilla
