1i5jtmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1i5jtmx/i_may_have_autism/,I may have autism?,"First off ai is a tool to access and connect stored info, not a doctor. It just pointed me in this direction so no hate please!

Anyway I used chatgpt to explore some symptoms I thought could be linked to a type of bipolar. Long story short we played the symptom game. He listed symptoms i said yes no or not sure. I gave examples from my life so he could help confirm a year or no. My every answer ended up a yes. Just wondering your opinions of these symptoms as people with autism are a bit more trustworthy regarding autism than current ai, lol. 

First off I have a family history and I was the fourth child born when my parents were in late 30s to early 40s

1. Difficulty Reading Social Cues:

Struggled to interpret romantic signals or intentions (many times missed out on opportunities only to realize the common sense later. Like missing that by asking to come in when nobody is home a girl wants to hook up)

•Misunderstood others' emotions or intentions in social contexts.

•Regularly told im being too loud or have and belittling tone, confuse discussions for arguments and give off the wrong cues making others think I'm mad when I'm not.

•Constanly over sharing beyond normally acceptable boundaries with almost anyone woth little to no shame unless someone personally tries to shame me. Same with doing other things publicly that others may be afraid or embarrassed of. 

•Overly honest to a fault unless I have strong reason to be dishonest and easy to catch if I lie to those who know me.

2. Literal Thinking and Difficulty with Abstract Concepts:

•Questions idioms like ""raining cats and dogs,"" focusing on their origins and logic. I get the saying but the fact that cats and dogs have no logical connection to raining bothers me. 

•Difficulty differentiating related terms like adjective and adverbs

3.Strong Emotional Reactions to Changes:

•Anger or frustration when plans change unexpectedly.


4. Awkwardness in Physical Activities or Coordination:

•Felt awkward in sports and described being “lanky” or clumsy.

•Bumps into corners frequently, struggles with spatial awareness.

5.Sensory Sensitivities or Stimming Behaviors:

•Paces while talking on the phone, feels physically uncomfortable if unable to.

•Moves toes constantly while lying in bed, tied to anxiety or discomfort.

•Displays repetitive actions or behaviors for comfort.

6.Fixation on Logic Over Emotion:

•Prioritizes logical reasoning and gets frustrated when others rely on emotional arguments.

•Attempts to logically convince himself out of fears or perceived consequences.

7.Workplace Challenges:

•Difficulty keeping jobs long-term due to miscommunications or minor mistakes escalating.

•Frustrated when logical reasons for absences (e.g., calling out) aren't accepted.

8.Social Anxiety or Discomfort in Group Settings:

•Feels awkward and insecure at parties, unsure how to act or what to do. 

•Relies on external factors (like substances) to ease social discomfort.

9.Repetitive or Rigid Behaviors:

•Experiences discomfort when routines or patterns are disrupted. My wife had low iron and slept all day. While I understand, I feel very frustrated and feel like I can't start anything until she gets up and has coffee with me.

•Frequently paces, fidgets, or engages in repetitive physical movements. I pace constantly when talking especially on the phone, I can sit in bed all day and my toes will twitch and wiggle the whole time and many more

10.Intense Interests or Hyperfocus:

•Strong interest in topics like ""The Lord of the Rings"" lore. I can tell you all about the origins of the elder scrolls pantheon and the different recent discoveries in science for ours and hours then give you a theory on the future direction of humanity based on that.

•Hyperfocuses on research or specific issues when motivated.

Constantly saying catchphrases and lines from all different characters i enjoyed throughout my life to the point it becomes something the whole house does. Like ""so you wanna fight"" from soul calibur and ""tell my mom I love her"" from lego marvel superheroes 2. 

11.Difficulty Transitioning Between Activities:

•Resistance or exhaustion when switching between tasks. If I just finished something I don't wanna do anything else for a while.

12.Rigid Thinking or Decision-Making:

•Prefers familiar problem-solving methods, showing reluctance to try alternatives. If someone tells me it is the wrong way ill likely try anyway before switching to another method.

13.Difficulty Understanding Social Nuances:

•Struggles with subtle interpersonal dynamics, leading to misunderstandings or conflicts. I regular have had conflicts from simple miscommunication or misinterpreted cues. I've been punched in the face for asking a guy if a girl was his girlfriend because of my unintended tone giving the wrong signals. 

14. Emotion Regulation Issues:

•Intense frustration when logical reasoning is ignored.

•Difficulty managing strong emotional responses.

•When overstimulated i snap, like if multiple people are arguing with me at once and not acknowledging my reasoning. This is commonly done with uncontrolled verbal insults but has been violent in rare rare occasions in the past

15.Difficulty Finding Objects:

•Needs precise instructions to locate items; vague directions like ""on the shelf"" lead to confusion and extended searching.

16.Observations from Conversations(what chat has noticed on their own:

•Deep self-reflection and thorough analysis of personal behaviors. For instance my old therapist said I didn't need her because I keep figuring out the causes of my behaviors themselves 

•Strong focus on specific details or patterns during conversations. Like the human nervous system upside down looks like a tree growing from a seed (which is how it actually develops) constantly connecting patterns in things I notice. 

•Repeated frustration with inefficiencies or illogical systems (e.g., workplace dynamics). Why can't I call out regularly given good notice? Its not like I get paid if I don't work, I'm a good worker even if I wanna limit how often I work.

•A tendency to revisit or expand on earlier points for clarity. I also tell the same stories constantly

Chats personal, Non-Professional Opinion

Yes, I strongly believe you show multiple traits consistent with autism spectrum disorder. Yes, it could be autism, a combination of overlapping conditions, or both. Many of the traits and experiences you’ve described—such as difficulties with emotional regulation, social nuances, rigid thinking, sensory sensitivities, and stimming behaviors—are hallmark features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While a combination of overlapping conditions could explain your traits, the consistency and breadth of your experiences point strongly toward ASD as a unifying framework. If I had to guess, autism is likely the primary explanation, with possible contributions from ADHD, anxiety, or OCD-like traits. He concluded that im looking at about 80-90% chance in his opinion.

I'm on disability for mental illness and haven't really ever worked in my life because of my mental illness.

I get enough on my disability cheque's to scrape by for the bare essentials and it helps that my parent used to be a high-power workaholic so I don't live in poverty or anything like that (not trying to sound pretentious). 

I find myself bored all the time but also totally uninterested in life.  I'm diagnosed complex post traumatic stress disorder and depression.  I don't want to use my diagnosis for an excuse of why I shouldn't live a life but I find little reason to do anything...

I try my absolute hardest.  Lately I've been waking up at 5am to go to coffee shops to journal and write music.  I've been trying to hit the gym to lose weight.  I go to mental health support groups during the day as often as my stress tolerance allows.  

I've become completely self sufficient socially and it feels really... numb.  I don't ""hang out"" with anyone or have any interests... I'm not really good at anything... and going out just gives me so much stress that my vision starts turning into a kaleidoscope.  Obviously, with the activities mentioned before that I'm trying hard to do my own exposure therapy, but damn, I feel numb and just... unimpressed...?

I'm not sure what would help.  I kind of have been living the same day over, raping too much and spending too much time kn the computer.  I try and to reintegration with life but life itself doesn't feel as... satisfying as a computer screen and the sensation I get from talking on a microphone.

Anyway, I'm just kind of venting I guess.  The depression and numbness are hitting hard and the reality that 30 will be here soon is... hard to hear since I had a really anxious childhood filled with lots of bullying that I still suffer the hyper-vigilant CPTSD symptoms of.  I'm scared of leaving the nest and I really don't think I could handle a minimum-wage job as the last one I had crushed me from being so empty of meaning.  

I like philosophy and music.  Those are really the two things that interest me.  Even then it still feels like shots in the dark because sometimes I feel I only like those things because I'm trying to find any sort of interest so I can find my path.  

I feel empty and aimless.  I have a good counselor I see and psych meds but there just seems to be a part of me that I can't break through to so I can live a life worth living.  Any help. ",1,1737353202.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

1i5jmog,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingErgonomic/comments/1i5jmog/the_great_debate_should_you_really_get_an/,The Great Debate: Should You Really Get an Adjustable Desk?,"## Exploring the Pros and Cons of Stand-Up Desks in Our Sitting World

Is it worth getting an adjustable desk? Well, I found myself pondering this question as I sat hunched over my computer, feeling like a pretzel. This article dives into the whirlwind of standing desks, examining their potential benefits and drawbacks. I’ll share my personal journey, sprinkle in some humor, and even throw in a few relatable anecdotes that might just make you giggle—or at least smirk. So, let’s tilt our desks, shall we? (That’s a figurative tilt, not an actual one, unless you’re brave enough!)
  
  
## The Rise of the Adjustable Desk

Most of us know the feeling: you're sitting at your desk, back hunched like a question mark, staring at the screen as if you might find the meaning of life hiding somewhere between the spreadsheets and your countless open tabs. As the hours tick by, your motivation dwindles along with your will to live. Okay, maybe that's a stretch, but you get the point. Enter the adjustable desk—a superhero (or supervillain, depending on who you ask) in the saga of workplace ergonomics.

Adjustable desks have exploded in popularity, and for good reason. With rising concerns about health in a workspace ruled by sitting, many people are desperately seeking alternative solutions. You know, that whole ""sitting is the new smoking"" thing? Yeah, it’s stuck in people's minds like a catchy song. I remember my first job, hunched over a traditional desk, my butt becoming one with the chair. Productivity? More like a game of “How many times can I check my phone before lunch?”

Every hour felt like an eternity, and my back was in a constant battle with my will to just get up and dance—if only I didn't have that serious meeting. In a world where we're glued to our chairs, adjustable desks promise a way to mix it up and maybe, just maybe, kick that fatigue to the curb. But are they really worth the hype?

## Health Benefits Beyond the Hype

You know, if my back could talk, it would probably have its own podcast at this point, filled with whining and horror stories from my years of bad desk posture. And let me tell you, some of those stories are pretty shocking! Who knew that sitting hunched over my laptop for hours would earn me a personal vendetta with my spine? I mean, my back is definitely on a first-name basis with the word ""pain"" – it practically whispers it when I bend over to tie my shoes!

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/is-it-worth-getting-an-adjustable-desk> 

Now, after doing some more digging into this whole adjustable desk thing, it seems they might just be the superhero I've been looking for. Research says that using an adjustable desk can significantly reduce back pain and improve posture. It’s like having a magic wand that says, “Stand up straight!”—except without the sparkles. Standing desks let you swing between sitting and standing, which can help engage those muscles we all forget we have when we sink into our comfy chairs.

Plus, who wouldn’t want to boost their productivity? I mean, have you ever noticed how standing can make you appear surprisingly more important? All of a sudden, you’re a power player in the office—just look at you, ruling the realm of your keyboard with confidence! So, could it be that investing in an adjustable desk is the golden ticket to a happier, healthier back? There's only one way to find out—until then, my back continues to plot its revenge.

## Adjustable Desks and Productivity: Myth or Reality?

When it comes to productivity, the debate around adjustable desks can feel like standing at a crossroads—what's the right path? Personally, I remember the whirlwind of creativity that overtook me the first day I slid into my shiny new adjustable desk. I felt like a productivity ninja, ready to conquer emails and flex my creative muscles. The difference? Well, it's more than just standing versus sitting. 

Research shows mixed results. A study published in the _Journal of Occupational Health Psychology_ found that standing desks could boost energy and focus, but they also mentioned that standing for too long could lead to fatigue. Yup, a classic case of ""too much of a good thing."" One minute, I was typing furiously, and the next, my legs were giving me a good ol' reminder to sit down. 

On the flip side, I’ve also read about folks who didn’t see any change in their productivity after switching. In one article I stumbled upon, a writer expressed how the novelty of a standing desk wore off faster than their patience during a long Zoom meeting. So, while some might feel like a rock star at their desk, others might find it just a fancy way to stand still.

So, is the adjustable desk worth it? It seems to depend on how often you hop between positions and avoid the dreaded all-day sit. What about you? Have you felt like a superhero or a statue at your desk?

## The Price Tag Dilemma

Let's face it. Adjustable desks can be a bit pricey. You know, when I first started thinking about getting one, I was fully prepared to shell out some serious cash. I mean, are we talking about desks or are we buying a new car? I felt like I needed an accountant just to sort through the options. Some fancy desks were asking as much as a mini vacation! I still remember the time I decided to splurge on a “premium” ergonomic chair. It turned into a regrettable love affair—it looked amazing, but, man! My wallet did not agree with my taste.

So, is it worth breaking the bank for an adjustable desk? Well, it depends. If you’re one of those people who sits at a desk for hours on end, it might be a solid investment. But before you empty your piggy bank, consider budget-friendly options. There are smaller adjustable desk converters that you can place on top of your existing desk. It’s like giving your tired old desk a comfy pillow to sit on!

I once found one of those converters at a garage sale for a fraction of its retail price. It even came with a slightly questionable coffee stain! But hey, at least I didn’t have to take out a loan. Look, the key is to weigh how much time you really spend at your desk. If it's your second home, a good desk can make all the difference—not just for your body but for your sanity!

## Adjust It Up: How to Make the Most of Your Desk

When I first got my adjustable desk, I felt a little like a puppy trying to figure out which end was up. The manual I received was about as clear as mud. I mean, who knew there were so many ways to adjust a desk? At first, I thought I’d just pull some levers and voilà—a standing desk all set! But no, my desk had other plans. 

To truly make the most of an adjustable desk, you need to play around with the height like it’s a game of Jenga. The ideal height for the desk is where your elbows can sit at about 90 degrees when typing. I learned this the hard way when I decided to set it too high. Let me tell you, typing at the height of Mount Everest was not enjoyable. My shoulders were practically touching my ears, and my productivity took a nosedive. I looked like a turtle trying to escape its shell.

Now, posture is another beast altogether. Keep your feet flat on the ground and your monitor at eye level—got it? I mean, simple, right? But I spent the first few days hunched over as if I was trying to read a mystery novel from the floor. So go ahead, adjust that desk! You might just transform your daily routine, maybe even rediscover your back after all this sitting. Don't forget to be patient with yourself; there’s definitely a learning curve, and you’ll get the hang of it. Just try not to get too dizzy while you’re adjusting!

## Finding Your Balance: The Final Verdict

When it comes to adjustable desks, the debate feels a bit like trying to choose between pizza and tacos—who doesn’t love both? But really, is it worth diving into the world of stand-up desks? Personally, I’ve found myself wrestling with this question. After all, work life has become a seated sport, and what a sticky mess it can be!

On the one hand, I've seen friends transform their productivity levels. Standing while working (or should I say 'wobbling' because I've tripped over my own feet more times than I’d like to admit) apparently helps with focus. Studies suggest that standing desks can improve mood and energy levels. However, be prepared for a little challenge here. If you’re anything like me—a self-proclaimed couch potato—standing for too long can lead to sore feet quicker than I can say “Where’s my chair?” 

And then, there are those who absolutely thrive in their comfortable chair cocoons. For them, a sit-to-stand desk may just collect dust. The reality is that not every lifestyle is cut out for constant switching between positions. **It’s about finding a rhythm** that suits your body and job. So, really, whether you should hop on the adjustable desk bandwagon depends on you: **What feels right? What energizes you?**

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, the journey of deciding if an adjustable desk is worth your hard-earned cash is quite personal. They can be a fantastic investment for your health, creativity, and even productivity—for some. But if you decide to keep your traditional setup, that’s totally fine too! Life is too short to live without your desk set just the way you like it, right? So, whether you’re standing tall or comfortably seated, just remember to mix it up, stretch a little, and enjoy the little quirks of your workspace.

It was such a bad time to work- I couldn't even take a nap at office because my manager would watch each and every one of us like those vultures looking for prey - and if we did, we had to get scolding from our team leader and manager. Vouldn't even take a break in between work except for a 30 minute break and dinner break- hell which was even counted and we had to stay back for another hour if someone took more than half an hour breaktime. Many a times sick leaves wouldn't even get approved and they would directly put a LOP. The constant drinking of coffee with too much sugar would have really caused diabetes if I stayed there any longer. I would come home at orning and wouldn't even get proper sleep because of the morning sunshine. I really became like a zombie within 2 months.

It was such a bad time to work- I couldn't even take a nap at office because my manager would watch each and every one of us like those vultures looking for prey - and if we did, we had to get scolding from our team leader and manager. Couldn't even take a break in between work except for a 30 minute break and dinner break- hell which was even counted and we had to stay back for another hour if someone took more than half an hour breaktime. Many a times sick leaves wouldn't even get approved and they would directly put a LOP. The constant drinking of coffee with too much sugar would have really caused diabetes if I stayed there any longer. I would come home at orning and wouldn't even get proper sleep because of the morning sunshine. I really became like a zombie within 2 months.

If anyone's reading this and work in BPO sector- i would request please, please stay away from graveyard shift. Its not worth it to earn some penny sacrificing your life. Today I gave an interview for customer service executive - but they told me that there would be no indian holiday, even no international holiday, sometimes even might have to work in weekends and yes, the deadly night shift. I said nope- and they told me to drop out the meeting. No regrets though.",17,1737352563.0,IndianWorkplace,6,1.0,False

I had to talk to someone that’s the head of the political science  department on my campus. Students work there too, and there was this guy (M23) that wrote for their newsletter I spoke to that I thought was kinda cute. I went up to him and asked how he got involved and he answered. He chuckled at a comment I made. He went back to his phone, but then I told him I liked his writing in the newsletter. He told me he liked writing about politics. That was when I saw his eyes quickly look me up and down. Then he bit the middle of his lower lip with a smile and his eyebrows flashed once. I didn’t look away and we kept the eye contact for a few more seconds. He did a little nod to himself, then began to do unplug wires by his desk. 

I made some small talk by asking him what he was studying and what he wanted to do. He told me he was a political science and English double major with a minor in philosophy and that he wants to go to law school. I realized we had a mutual interest in philosophy and briefly spoke about our favorites. There was another awkward silence since he focused on his tasks and I didn’t want to bother him. Afterwards, I looked at the name tag on his desk and told him I recognized his last name and asked if he didn’t mind sharing his background. I asked if he spoke the language to which he gave a small smile and he said yes. Then he asked me if I did (the only question he asked back this whole convo), I said yes, and we spoke a bit in our mutual language. Then he went back to his phone again. 

I didn’t want to bother him so I packed up my stuff and left. Shortly after I realized I left my umbrella and came back for it. His desk was across from it on the other side of the room. When I came back he straightened his back, and looked up from his phone. His eyes followed me as I grabbed it. He looked back at his phone once I turned around. I said it was nice meeting him then left. 

2 weeks later I had to go back to talk to the head of the department again regarding some planning for humanities event. I met more students that worked there and spoke to a friend I knew. I observed the guy and noticed he keeps to himself and is on the computer most of the time doing work. He seems rather quiet and reserved, which I liked. I didn’t really talk to him until the end. I heard him talk to a guy in the office and heard him mention my high school's name. I said I went there too and he said “oh nice.” It was an arts hs so I asked what he studied and he said art. I told him I did music, and he said “that’s really cool.” Then I asked him what year he graduated and he said in 2019. I graduated a year before him so we related to being super seniors in college. He said “so you were also here for some time.” I found out he’s graduating in December and I in spring. Since common hours ended, we had to leave and I tried to talk to him as we left. I told him I remembered talking to him last time, he said he did too, then told him my name.  

It got awkward since he didn’t speak to me unless I spoke to him. We were heading down the steps and he took out his phone.  He pointed to another direction and said he’s going to head the other way. I left, but then I saw him still standing on the stairs on his phone, though he did leave later on. I was so confused since he only spoke to me unless I spoke to him, but he approached a dude he works with just fine. I thought he maybe didn’t like me as much. However, even if he didn't ask me much questions like I did, I remembered the way he looked me up and down after I complimented his writing. I was surprised he looked at me that way and didn't expect. That's one of the signs I usually look for.  

I made new friends in the office that kept inviting me back. I always hoped I’d get to talk to the guy but I didn’t see him again. Two months passed, around finals week I was walking on campus and saw him heading the opposite way. I thought he didn’t recognise me, but as I walked by I saw his head turn. That was the last time I saw him. 

Yesterday I grabbed coffee with one of the girls from the office to catch up. I ended up telling her abt my crush on the guy and how I wished I got to talk to him again, and she wants to connect us since she is familiar with him. She thinks he was just nervous after I told her about our interactions. I noticed he mostly just talked to some of the guys in the office so I'm well aware of the introversion and reserved personality. Idk if there's a chance he might've been remotely attracted to me but I want to see if connecting to him would be worth it. ",1,1737352078.0,bodylanguage,2,1.0,False

[^^Soundtrack: ^^Earthrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnoRlKzeIaI)

Earthrise was beautiful, ethereal, unreal. A sight that inspired awe in the caveperson part of the brain that motivated the first humans to venerate, ritualize, worship, ascribe to belief what modern humanity chooses to explain away with science. The first faint crescent fingernail's arc of blue-white cresting over the monochrome greyscale moonscape, harbinger of the progenitor-world and beating heart of humankind, sends a shock through the nervous system that practically commands devotion, abasement, the urge to kneel down into a pose alternating between sun salutation and an imperial kowtow, like a muezzin's call to prayer during Ramadan when you're in a square surrounded by a particularly devout crowd that drags you down with them through sheer force of gravity - or perhaps a more mystical kind of pressure. 

Despite the lunar gravity - or near lack thereof, really - [**Minerva Céleste Chevalier-Lin Yuemei**](https://imgur.com/a/5WJc07W), professional livestreamer and very much an agnostic if not an atheist, caught herself unconsciously bending down as if in worshipful praise of the Earth. A difficult task, at least for someone experiencing her first few hours on the lunar surface in a borrowed secondhand sojourner's suit that didn't quite fit right, was overly tight on the joints, and which smelled faintly burnt. The last issue was very normal, she had been assured at the welcome office at de Gerlache crater, due to the lunar surface (and by extension the dust kicked up from it) naturally smelling something between burnt satay, gunpowder, and baijiu. Minerva wasn't convinced that the interior of the helmet should normally smell like the moon dust that it was meant to keep out, but the clerk at the office hadn't looked very interested in listening to any protests and had already begun chatting up the friendly, wealthy-looking if somewhat disoriented African businesswoman who had flown in next to her on the same shuttle, so she had simply accepted the suit with a hesitant nod and a brief wave goodbye at her newfound friend - ah! She had forgotten to get her name! Too late now, though - before bouncing off to the excursion airlock. 

Now, out past the safety of the tented crater rim and into the barren moonscape, stumbling about with nothing to grab onto for support but also knowing vaguely that faceplanting was both normal and not at all hazardous, Minerva realized that she probably should've asked for a suit that fit better. She resisted the urge to prostrate herself, mostly due to the fact that getting up afterwards would be a careful exercise in strength-control to avoid launching herself into the air (void?) that she would rather avoid, and instead engaged her ocular contacts and sensorial implants to begin livestreaming back to the noosphere node back at de Gerlache, which presumably would then blast the experience-stream back to Earth through continuous laser tightbeam. She had to pay a premium for the bandwidth, part of the reason why she had settled for a borrowed communal sojourner suit instead of splashing out on a higher-end rental. 

Already there were *danmu* bullet comments flying across the lower left corner of her vision, a colourful stream of text in the Bahasa-Swahili-Hindustani pidgin that so dominated the internet spaces of the Global South, peppered by loanwords and slang cribbed from Huayu, Arabic, French, Hausa, Portuguese, and so many other languages. Some comments in Classical English, Latin, or Japanglish, though that wasn't really her main audience. Several hundreds of thousands of viewers - not much in the grand scheme of things, but certainly enough to snag her some niche humanist org sponsorships and a decent revenue-sharing deal for her travelogue show. 

""Friends,"" she began, realizing belatedly that she was audibly short of breath from her hyperventilatingly strenuous stumble fumble tumble over the moonscape from de Gerlache to her vantage current point on a Peak of Sixty-Five Percent Eternal Light. ""Allow me to recite a poem written by the venerable Li Bai, whose poetry skills far exceed my own.

>""Before my bed lies a pool of moon bright

>I could imagine that it's frost on the ground

>I look up and see the bright shining moon

>Bowing my head I am thinking of home.""

""Before coming to the moon, I suppose I never really understood Li Bai's feeling of homesickness - the world is ours, after all, and home is where the heart is. Friends, our little community spans the world, tethered together through the noosphere and power of love for humanity. Wherever on Earth I roamed, I could always find friends, and I would always feel at home. But now, seeing Earthrise for the first time, that blue crescent holding nearly the entirety of humanity in its warm embrace while I stand - okay *lah*, more sway and pant - upon the blasted wasteland of a mostly-dead world, I think I truly get what Li Bai felt over a thousand years ago.""

Minerva paused to catch her breath, making sure to keep her gaze trained upon the growing sliver of blue and white that waxed with every passing moment. A bright dot off to the right of the waxing Earth, millions of kilometres away, was Venus - and with a powerful enough telescope, one would see the faint silhouette of the massive sunshade that the Africans and the Nusantaran Venusian Development Authority were slowly putting together within its orbit.  They meant to terraform the pressure cooker world, so they said, although none alive today would likely be left to enjoy the final result in centuries' time. 

Minerva's laryngeal implant would filter out most of her heavy breathing, although the *danmu* had a few jokers mocking her for not getting enough cardio. 

""Listen *ah*,"" she retorted, ""it's a lot harder to stay on your feet here than you think, friends, especially if you're in a hurry to catch the Earthrise. Gravity on the moon is sixteen percent that of the Earth's - it takes time to get used to moving about up here. I'll give you a demonstration later."" 

She'd need to set up the camera drone after this, rented from the KemKebud resource centre at de Gerlache spaceport and supposedly paired to her wrist implant - although the reviews had mentioned that the drones there had a tendency to misbehave due to bandwidth interference from a nearby Angkatan Antariksa station. 

""Anyways,"" she continued, ""friends, behold! I can see all of you, or at least most of you, and if you look up you can see me, too!"" And it was true, because the Earth had crept much faster than she expected and was now half-exposed up there in the sky of the lunar south pole, eastern Africa and Bharat and western Indonesia hanging there upside-down and glowing with the lights of civilization blazing into the night. 

""Friends, *pengyoumen*, *copains*, *marafiki*… from up here, home feels so far away. It's all so fragile, our biosphere perhaps ten kilometres thick across the crust of a single world revolving in the blackness, like a layer of lichen on a mossy rock that can be scraped away with just a touch. We should treat it better, shouldn't we? I can't believe our ancestors saw this planet in all its natural beauty, saw each other in all our beautiful diversity, and decided that ruining it with strip-mining and credit scores and mass marketing was a good idea.""

Just then an arrowhead-shaped blob drifted across the blue hemisphere, looking like a confused space jellyfish adrift upon the solar wind. One of the Angkatan Antariksa's [Garuda gunboats](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dd0k5w/secret_the_garudas_claws_what_no_you_cant_just/) that patrolled cislunar space, bristling with railguns and missiles, and that showed the flag across Nusantara Outre-Terre, she realized, eyes narrowed. When she was a little girl, the sight of one of those floating blobs, lifting envelope billowing from unrestrained inertia, provoked whimsy and joy. Now, it felt like sacrilege, an unwanted armed intrusion into what should've been the peaceful heavens. 

""And our petty human squabbles seem so small in comparison, really,"" she declared both to the void and to the half-a-million viewers now watching her stream, ""although of course even up here in space we have collectively desecrated our celestial inheritance with war and bloodshed. Damn stupid *sia*, isn't it, my friends?""

The *danmu* mostly seemed to agree, although espousing environmentalism and pacifism was bound to receive agreement anyways. 

Still, basking in the pale blue light of the Earth, Minerva found that she believed it.

## Selatapura, Nusantara Outre-Terre

## 4th Arrondissement, Shackleton Crater, Luna

[^^Soundtrack: ^^Selatapura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENKFTmJxBaY)

**Iskandar Laksmana**, Commissioner for the Nusantaran Lunar Authority in Selatapura and head of the Selatapura Development Board, not to mention appointed-elected representative of the lunar city to the Masjlis Persekutuan - thereby reporting to two different authorities while representing a third! - was not having a particularly good day, seeing as it had started with the unannounced visit of an armed Garuda gunship and its unknown clutch of secretive but clearly important passengers to de Gerlache spaceport (this required the summonsing of the local Angkatan Antariksa liaison to his office and getting stonewalled as to why there was a team of unidentified armoured soldiers in his city) and had continued with the news that Lim Hock Beng, Magistrate for Kampung de Gerlache, had been found dead in the presence of a [UASR Baraza councilwoman](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dg6si2/news_a_visitors_guide_to_the_union_of_african/) who had since been detained by the aforementioned squad of unidentified soldiers. 

Starla wasn't returning his calls, either, and she was the one person he knew who could get him answers about the comings and goings of Nusantaran interorbital warships and the shadowy soldiers they conveyed. She was busy woman, of course, and Iskandar didn't have much hope of an immediate response, but if she had ordered - or countenanced, at least - the deployment of a black ops team to Selatapura, he hoped that Starla would at least have the decency to speak with him about it afterwards.

For all that Nusantara's much-lauded modernized Mandala model of decentralized governance meant that local problems could be resolved with local solutions, it also meant that there were multiple layers of competing authorities at every level across the Persekutuan. The Lunar Authority, his ostensible employer and clearest chain of command, was an extension of the Ministry for Extraterrestrial Affairs, itself one half of the authority engaged in the administration of Nusantara Outre-Terre. The Selatapura Development Board, of which he was the appointed leader, was a statutory board authorized by the Masjlis Persekutuan to manage the day-to-day administration and expansion of the growing and sprawling municipality that took up much of the lunar south pole. In turn he was also a legislator of the Masjlis Persekutuan, elected by Selatapura's citizens by virtue of being the only person permitted by the Lunar Authority to run for the office. 

Selatapura was considered a special autonomous region akin to the Nanyang Republic, and so the Lunar Authority's word was supposedly law - and yet because it was also considered a region of significant import to Persekutuan security, the Angkatan Antariksa - and by extension the Ministry of Defence - extended its own layer of securitization and impunity upon the south pole. Iskandar knew that there were thousands of automated surveillance posts scattered around Selatapura reporting to Starla's headquarters at Nyai Roro Kidul Station in geostationary orbit - and thousands more reporting to a myriad other security agencies, corporate offices, Persekutuan ministries, subfederal governments, and clandestine actors. All competed for influence, budget share, and a seat at the political table when the time came for a government shuffle, which meant that they rarely talked to one another. Authority and surveillance were ubiquitous yet hopelessly balkanized, then, which made evading targeted surveillance perhaps easier than one would expect and which made Iskandar's job that much more difficult and fraught with political landmines. 

""*Chao chibai*,"" he muttered, kicking off from his desk to snatch another bulb of steaming *teh tarik* from his office assistant drone. 

""Still no response from Starla, hmm?"" That was Lucia Suparmanputri, regional superintendent for the Lunar Authority's Public Safety Directorate - which meant the Ministry of Extraterrestrial Affairs' chief of internal security for Selatapura. Yet another layer of securitization and surveillance, in other words, but in this case she worked if not for, then with him. 

""No,"" Iskandar replied, still fuming at the memory of having to deal with the Space Force liaison's evasive non-answers. ""And we've lost track of where those soldiers took this madam… Saratu Haruna? *Chibai*, the Africans are going to have very angry questions if we don't find her.""

Lucia grimaced, knowing that she'd likely be hung out to dry by the Lunar Authority alongside Iskandar if the Baraza councilwoman didn't turn up soon. The Kaabuan consulate in Selatapura hadn't been informed yet - Iskandar had done his best to buy them some time - but Lucia still expected to have the consul banging on her door for answers soon enough. 

Her wrist implant chimed just then, the subdermal hologram projectors throwing up a brief report in the air before her. Iskandar watched her, one eyebrow raised, as Lucia's eyes narrowed. 

""A lead?"" he asked. 

""Maybe,"" she replied. ""From a source, anonymous but one of my best so far. Saratu Haruna was last identified by our systems in the presence of…a clerk at the welcome centre at de Gerlache spaceport, a waiter at a café about two blocks from the Magistrate's office, and an experience streamer seated beside her during her orbital transfer down to de Gerlache. She dropped off our systems just as she entered the kampung administration building - severe jamming, although the jamming had also followed her intermittently from the spaceport onwards.""

""Sounds like this Baraza councilor was carrying a jammer, then? Looks guilty to me,"" he mused. 

""Maybe so,"" Lucia answered, ""but she's still a foreign national from an allied state who has certain legal rights. Getting extraordinarily renditioned by a Space Force black ops team certainly violates a few."" 

Iskandar took off his glasses and rubbed his temples. There was a migraine coming on, he knew. 

""*Pua peh yao siu!*"" he cursed, flaring his glamour in a bright red sun behind him, ""and to their eighteenth generations, too!"" 

A deep breath, then a sigh. 

""Go grab those last contacts,"" he told her, ""and go see if they know anything. I'm going to pull some strings and see which parts of the panopticon I can wrangle to help us, and hopefully Starla will call me back in the meantime.""

""She didn't do it.""

""What?""

""Starla called me back,"" Iskandar said. ""It wasn't her. Space Force commander has no idea who detained the UASR lady. Garuda arrived here without her authorization. She's tracking down who gave the order now."" 

Lucia rolled her eyes. The hologram depicted that in stunning fidelity, down to the derision and clear message that she thought it was bullshit.

""That's awfully convenient for her, isn't it?"" she replied. 

""Yes,"" he answered, ""but Starla wouldn't lie to me. And guess what - that Space Force liaison I met with earlier? Can't find his registration anywhere in the system. He's vanished. Starla couldn't find him, either. I don't think he actually was Space Force, after all."" 

""*Sialan!*"" Lucia said. ""Fuck!"" she added for good measure. 

""Fuck,"" Iskandar agreed. ""Black ops team, not Space Force, jamming our surveillance and dropping off the face of the moon after kidnapping a foreign citizen murder suspect. And commandeering a gunship, too."" 

""Shit. Nothing from the clerk and the waiter, by the way. I've got the livestreamer in my office - I'm about to speak with her. Her profile is…more than I expected. She might be useful.""

Iskandar blinked. ""A livestreamer?""

""Yes,"" Lucia replied. ""But possibly more, according to my sources. I'll keep you posted.""

## Selatapura, Nusantara Outre-Terre

## Kampung de Gerlache, de Gerlache Crater, Luna

[^^Soundtrack: ^^Nasib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd8fe_kF-Ic)

Minerva wasn't quite sure why she had been met by two Public Safety agents at the de Gerlache airlock, nor why they had asked her to come with them to the station for a ""coffee break."" She did note that they had heavy-looking pistols at their hips, however, and that while they were polite they also looked quite firm and unlikely to put up with any protests. She went with them to the station for coffee.

There, she was met by someone named Lucia, supposedly the Public Safety chief in Selatapura. For a moment she was afraid that her impromptu speech during the experience stream had gotten her in trouble; Minerva had always played around with pushing as far as she could go before the censors caught on, but so far she had gotten away with little more than a POFMA warning. She feared that her lucky streak had ended.

But Lucia simply showed her an image of an African lady in a green and blue dress and a loose blue hijab, probably in her late thirties or early forties, about Minerva's own age - that nice businesswoman from the shuttle transfer down to de Gerlache, she realized with a start. 

""She looks familiar, correct?""

Minerva nodded. 

""Yes,"" she said, ""I sat beside her on the ride down from the Luna transfer. You should already know that. What about her?""

""Her name is Saratu Haruna, a Baraza councilwoman from Kaabu in the UASR, and she's wanted for the murder of Lim Hock Beng, Magistrate of this kampung,"" came the reply. 

""Oh.""

""Oh indeed. Now, did you speak with her on the shuttle? Or did you notice anything about her that stood out?""

""Other than her being fairly wealthy and being an African visiting a Nusantaran lunar settlement?""

""Please, Ms. Chevalier-Lin. We have a sizable international community here. Anything else?""

""Fine,"" Minerva replied. ""We chatted a bit about how it was both of our first times coming to the moon, she was here for some sort of business deal and I told her I was here to do some livestreams for my travel show. Her handbag looked expensive. Nothing else."" 

""Hmm,"" hmmed the policewoman. ""You're sure there's nothing else? Because she seems to be wanted by quite a few groups of interest, and your name has cropped up adjacent to them recently. This could become a bigger problem for you, Ms. Chevalier-Lin.""

Minerva swallowed, feeling her stomach rising up to her throat. 

""I think I would like to speak with a lawyer,"" she said. 

""Now now,"" Lucia said, raising a pacifying hand. ""I'm not saying you're a suspect. For now I simply would like your cooperation. And perhaps your help.""

Here Minerva raised an eyebrow. 

""You see,"" Lucia continued, ""Saratu Haruna seems to have gone missing, spirited away immediately afterwards by agents unknown and most certainly not in the employ of the Lunar Authority."" 

""Rogue actors, then?""

""Of sorts. You must've noticed that Garuda that landed around the same time as your shuttle, yes? That's the one that brought the team of soldiers who then detained Madame Haruna and whisked her off. Their trail ran cold at an MRT station north of de Gerlache crater, Earth side. We spoke with the Angkatan Antariksa - they said it wasn't them."" 

""Sounds like a you problem *meh?* And not one that I want to get caught up in.""

""Probably. But I've seen your record, Ms. Chevalier-Lin. National service, then military intelligence, one deployment to the Jerusalem Front and one to the Sao Paulo Underhive. Mostly censored, even for me, but what was there was…impressive. Not your average *ah lian*. You can help.""

""I resigned my commission already,"" Minerva retorted. ""I'm just a *suaku* livestreamer now."" 

""Which makes you a free agent with minimal political ties. No need to worry about crossed wires or stepping on toes.""

""Excuse me?""

Lucia sighed, poured another mug of kopi c and offered it to Minerva. She then placed a small metallic puck, about the size of her palm, onto the desk. She pressed the silver button in the centre, and immediately Minerva could sense a slight popping sensation in her ears. 

""Localized jammer,"" Lucia explained. ""This room is now shielded for the time being.""

Minerva nodded, still not really understanding. 

""I am aware of your ties to certain political movements that are calling for governance reforms - we've reviewed your streams, and you're not as subtle as you think. The Great Game of Musical Chairs is about to begin soon, isn't it? The rotational election for Yang di-Pertuan Nusantara, I mean. And all the politicking that happens behind the scenes. This killing is related to it, I think. Lim Hock Beng was a well-connected man, and the timing seems…suspicious."" 

""And?""

""And my patron, who you may be acquainted with, is concerned that this could be a move by one of her contenders for the throne. The *real* throne, not the one you see at the investiture ceremony.""

""And who might that patron of yours be?""

""[**Ramakrishnan-Lai.**](https://imgur.com/a/7KvRGHn)"" 

Minerva took a deep breath. Let it out. Then another. 

""Never heard of her *lah*.""

Lucia chuckled. ""Please, don't patronize me. The accidental leader? Kompas put out a puff piece on her when she first got the crown. The spearhead of the cautiously progressive centralist movement, power behind the throne for two terms before getting sidelined by the federalist hardliners in Green Archipelago.""

Minerva sighed. ""Fine, yes, I know her. Met her briefly once. A very big tiger indeed, at the time. She's out of office now, isn't she? And a PAPist. Not really my type.""

""Demoted to deputy undersecretary for executive affairs, which I suppose was the best she could secure for herself after the last elections. Barely a PAP member anymore, not ever since they joined up with Green Archipelago. She's championing a new contender though, under the Hope for the Future umbrella, and someone from the Bersatu generation, not the *priyayi* old-timers running the show now.""

""…Nasib Majulah?""

""Yes, him. A corny nom de guerre, but his party's been winning enough byelections across the archipelago with a strong message of social progress that he might stand a chance. You're a fan, I wager.""

""Of sorts."" A sigh. ""Just tell me what you want me to do *lor*. I can see that you're not letting me out of this office until I agree. …and I suppose I do want to help that nice lady, too.""

## Selatapura, Nusantara Outre-Terre

## Kampung Prasetyopuri MRT, north of de Gerlache Crater, Luna

The MRT line to the north (although truly everything was 'north' relative to de Gerlache) ran through a long lava tube, the hollowed-out remains of ancient magma flows back when the moon had just coalesced from the shattered remains of Theia and Gaia, the two protoplanet predecessors to today's Earth system. Born of a celestial collision, two worlds smashed into each other like billiard balls, the birth-scream of the world was one ripped from death and violence. That same violence, the original sin, had become embedded in an infant humanity as it evolved within its cradle. Perhaps it was impossible to hope for peace when violence was so entwined in the story of the Earth.

Stepping off (carefully!) with Lucia from the train onto the station platform, borrowed (but infinitely cleaner) sojourner suit in tow, Minerva was greeted by a tall man in a white-and-red sojourner suit, complete with a wave-patterned lunar silk *samping* wrapped around his waist down to the knees and with his helmet tucked under the crook of one arm. He extended the other for Minerva to shake. 

""Iskandar Laksmana, Lunar Authority Commissioner for Selatapura. Good to have you here, Ms. Chevalier-Lin.""

Minerva took the proffered hand, giving him a careful look. 

""Lucia's with me,"" he offered, as if sensing the question lurking behind her eyes. ""Same tiger, same stripes.""

She nodded briefly. Good enough, she supposed. 

""And this was where Haruna was last seen?"" she asked. 

""Yes,"" he replied, ""but I've since been informed that they've taken her on a rover - unregistered and without a transponder, naturally - but satellites are tracking them heading towards Cabeus Crater. About a hundred kilometres from here, shouldn't take longer than an hour to get there.""

""The problem is that Cabeus was tented over by the UNSC's pet Russians,"" Lucia jumped in. ""We don't have jurisdiction there - though not having jurisdiction clearly didn't bother our rogue actor friends when they nabbed Haruna in *my* city."" 

""…and so you want me to go as a private individual, is it?"" Minerva asked. 

""You and a few trusted and vetted Lunar Authority agents, yes. You do the talking, they'll be your backup muscle. You can probably bribe your way past the Russians and get them to look the other way,"" Iskandar answered. ""Extract her from Cabeus, get her to the MSV *Tabbycat* - that's a rockhopper we have parked at a privately-owned shelter about fifty kilometres northeast of Cabeus - and then we'll get you all over to safety at the UASR Lunar Affairs Commission headquarters at Kagamji.""

""Hopefully by then we'll have finished our crime scene investigation here,"" Lucia continued. ""The Africans are going to be *pissed*. But their home turf is still going to be the safest place on the moon - none of our domestic players can risk damaging our alliance with Mahakamji."" 

""Wait,"" interjected Minerva, a thought occurring to her. ""The Garuda that brought the hit squad here. Can't it just show up and obliterate us from orbit?"" 

Iskandar shook his head. ""We're tracking it on a Molniya orbit - it's heading towards the dark side of the moon right now, and it'll be there for about four hours before cresting back over the Earth side and Cabeus. Space Force command is dispatching a frigate out here to give us some cover and to round up their wayward chick - they'll be on-station in about the same time. Until then, we'll have a pair of armed [Écureuil avisos](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1i4ja89/tech_ligue_militaire_%C3%A9cureuilclass_planetary/) from the Lunar Authority standing by on the ground. That should give you enough leeway to be in and out."" 

""And launching a ground bombardment in cislunar space would be a…significant escalation,"" broke in Lucia. ""Whoever's behind this, if they're who I think they might be, they can't risk calling this much attention to themselves. Not yet, not now. You'll be safe and sound."" 

And with that, she was bundled off to a waiting rover at the MRT exit airlock, a narrow tunnel cut into the lava tube wall that sloped upwards to the lunar surface. Inside, she was greeted by a pair of heavyset men and a slender, lithe woman, all in black sojourner suits with what appeared to be plate inserts over the chest and back. Empty velcro patches lay where she had expected to see Lunar Authority insignia - disavowed, in other words. Frowning, she realized belatedly that her suit had the same treatment, sans the armour plates. 

""Khalis, Chen, Aisha."" The woman pointed to each of them in turn, then offered Minerva a small taser pistol, easily concealable in the equipment pouch at her thigh. ""It'll be seventy-five minutes to Cabeus. They'll beat us there by sixty. Surveillance access is limited there, but we've got satellites watching the aboveground exits, so they shouldn't get away too easily. You talk, we'll back you up."" 

Minerva nodded, unhappy but resigned. And then the rover trundled off into the greyscale wastes into the unknown.",1,1737352068.0,worldpowers,0,1.0,False

the issue from where all this stems is that this is the third time he’s been with his friends and talked to me like this when he normally never speaks to me this way… the first time was actually the first time i met his friend group, he invited me on a date to watch his friend compete in something but ended up leaving me behind with a few of his other friends, or from my perspective, a literal group of strangers that would barely even look at me *(i have insanely bad social anxiety, and he knows this)* to go hang out with his best friend in the back where all the other athletes were… to the point where i asked if i should just uber home and he said yes, so i spent $70 to get home crying my eyes out bc that was my first impression of them, and of him when he’s with them, yet he made it clear that i didn’t matter 

we’ve talked about it a couple times now and i thought i was absolutely clear that i’m now worried about how he treats me and communicates with me when he’s with his friends, but for some reason he keeps thinking something else? whenever he’s with them he makes it seem so easy to brush me off and pretend i don’t exist… both in person and over text… is there a better way to communicate that to him??? bc i feel like i’m not wording it properly

He's into gift giving and acts of service, while I give words of affirmation and physical affection. It does feel out of balance sometimes since he doesn't show me love the same way, but I've generally felt secure in our relationship since I've translated his love languages, except for these past few months. I've felt like I'm not enough and that he's falling out of love with me. I've never felt like porn and the like would be an issue for me, but when I see him view the occasional naughty photo, I feel my heart break and I don't know what to do with myself. This morning I cuddled with him as he scrolled on his phone and attempted to initiate by kissing and licking his chest. I ignored him saying ""stop, you're distracting me,"" because he plays hard to get. Then I turned my head to just rest against him after I begin to believe he didn't want to have sex. And on his phone was another woman's behind in lingerie. He moved to get it off the screen. I kind of laughed it off, but left the bedroom because I was incredibly hurt and embarrassed. I didn't and still don't know how to tell him how much it disturbed me. There was a similar instance a couple months ago. I really wish I didn't feel the way I do. It's silly and I think I need to get over myself. I think in large part it's because I still yearn for physical affection and know I won't receive it. I love hugs and hand holding and the occasional no-reason kiss. I've told him this throughout our time together but I find myself waiting and lonely or feeling embarrassed or rejected (once, I tried to kiss him hello in public and he moved past me to get in the car. I never did it again. We used to have public make out sessions in our early days of dating). Every night, I reach over to just touch his arm or his face while he's scrolling but he doesn't react or asks me what I'm doing. I tell him I want to touch him and he just... lays there continuing to scroll. I feel hurt and lonely. Sometimes he responds positively, but now I'm afraid it's because he was looking at another woman. I don't know what happened to him prior to when he met me so I still try to be patient and understanding of the fact that not everyone likes physical affection and maybe one day he'll be more open to it. He does show me love in his own way, like bringing me coffee in the morning or buying flowers for me even though he thinks it's silly. He treats me like a princess when I'm on my period (except for the touching). I don't want to say it's not enough because I do enjoy the attention and the affection his face and voice shows.

Remember when you were a kid? Your best friend was your whole world. Inseparable. Sharing every secret. But now? It’s a different story.

As we grow up, friendships get tricky. We start wondering, “Am I doing enough?” Sound familiar?

# Maintaining Friendships: Are We Doing Too Much?

Here’s the thing: many of us are trying to be superheroes. We’re attempting to maintain every friendship with the same intensity as our childhood BFFs. Exhausting, right?

Take Sarah, for instance. She’s 32, killing it in marketing, but her social life? It’s giving her anxiety. “I feel guilty when I can’t reply to every message or show up at every gathering,”. We’ve all been there, Sarah.

But here’s a liberating truth: it’s okay. You don’t have to be equally close with everyone. Shocking, I know!

So, how did we end up here? Life happened. We moved for college, jobs, love. Our social circles expanded faster than our capacity to nurture them all.

Sunil, a 28-year-old coder, gets it. He’s moved three times in five years. “I’ve got friends scattered everywhere,” he says. “Keeping up with everyone? It’s like a full-time job!”

But here’s where it gets interesting. People are starting to prioritize quality over quantity in friendships. It’s not about how many friends or followers you have anymore. But how well you maintain friendships with those around you. It’s about the real connections.

# The Friendship Trio: Hero, Hygiene, and Hub Friends

That’s why we’re seeing new ways of categorizing friendships. Buckle up, because this might change how you view your social circle:

1. **Hero Friends**: These are your ride-or-die pals. You love them, but they might not always be available. And that’s okay! Meet Ashwini, 35, a teacher. Her hero friend is Sunita, a busy entrepreneur. They don’t talk often, but when they do? Magic happens. “I’ve learned our friendship doesn’t need daily check-ins to be meaningful,” Ashwini says.



1. **Hygiene Friends**: Your everyday buddies. Think neighbors, colleagues, gym pals. Lisa, 40, has this figured out. Her neighbor Mark? They chat while walking dogs. Grab coffee sometimes. “It’s not deep,” Lisa says, “but it adds a nice rhythm to life.” We see you, Lisa!



1. **Hub Friends**: Your social anchors. They keep you connected to your wider circle. Emma, 29, calls her college roommate Olivia her hub friend. Different cities, but daily texts and weekly calls. “Olivia keeps me in the loop with everyone,” Emma explains. Sounds like a friendship jackpot!

Now, you might be thinking, “Wait, should I categorize my friends?” [Slow down](https://reconstruct.ideaparticles.com/online-bubble-wrap-popper.html), champ! It’s not about labeling. It’s about understanding different friendship dynamics. Some thrive on daily chats. Others? They can pick up right where they left off after months of silence.

Interesting, right? But here’s where it gets even juicier.

Friendships are like investments, but way more unpredictable. If we had a Friendship Charts Satisfaction Index (sadly, we don’t), it’d be all over the place!

So why bother juggling multiple friendships? Great question!

# The Economics of Friendship

1. friendship economics is unique. It’s not about quantity. It’s about quality and rarity. Think about your childhood bestie. Years might pass, but when you meet? It’s like no time has passed at all. That’s the magic of shared history.

2. Life stages matter too. Your college party buddy might not fit into your new parent life. And that’s okay!

3. [Patience](https://reconstruct.ideaparticles.com/color-me-now.html) is key. Some friendships are slow burners. That work colleague? In 10 years, they might be your closest confidant. You never know!

*So, what’s the takeaway? Friendships evolve. We evolve. It’s all part of the game. Don’t pressure yourself to maintain every friendship at maximum intensity. It’s not realistic, and honestly? It’s not necessary.*

# Embracing Diverse Friendships

Embrace the diversity of your friendships. Prioritize without guilt. The best friendships? They understand and grow with you, no matter what category they fall into.

*Before you go, here’s a fun fact: anthropologist Robin Dunbar says humans can only maintain about 150 stable relationships. Mind-blown? Next time you’re scrolling through your contacts, remember: quality over quantity!*

Now, go share this with your friends (all categories welcome) on WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Spread the friendship wisdom!

Until next time, keep being an awesome friend – in your own unique way!

Take Sarah, for instance. She’s 32, killing it in marketing, but her social life? It’s giving her anxiety. “I feel guilty when I can’t reply to every message or show up at every gathering,”. We’ve all been there, Sarah.

But here’s a liberating truth: it’s okay. You don’t have to be equally close with everyone. Shocking, I know!

So, how did we end up here? Life happened. We moved for college, jobs, love. Our social circles expanded faster than our capacity to nurture them all.

Sunil, a 28-year-old coder, gets it. He’s moved three times in five years. “I’ve got friends scattered everywhere,” he says. “Keeping up with everyone? It’s like a full-time job!”

But here’s where it gets interesting. People are starting to prioritize quality over quantity in friendships. It’s not about how many friends or followers you have anymore. But how well you maintain friendships with those around you. It’s about the real connections.

# The Friendship Trio: Hero, Hygiene, and Hub Friends

That’s why we’re seeing new ways of categorizing friendships. Buckle up, because this might change how you view your social circle:

1. **Hero Friends**: These are your ride-or-die pals. You love them, but they might not always be available. And that’s okay! Meet Ashwini, 35, a teacher. Her hero friend is Sunita, a busy entrepreneur. They don’t talk often, but when they do? Magic happens. “I’ve learned our friendship doesn’t need daily check-ins to be meaningful,” Ashwini says.



1. **Hygiene Friends**: Your everyday buddies. Think neighbors, colleagues, gym pals. Lisa, 40, has this figured out. Her neighbor Mark? They chat while walking dogs. Grab coffee sometimes. “It’s not deep,” Lisa says, “but it adds a nice rhythm to life.” We see you, Lisa!



1. **Hub Friends**: Your social anchors. They keep you connected to your wider circle. Emma, 29, calls her college roommate Olivia her hub friend. Different cities, but daily texts and weekly calls. “Olivia keeps me in the loop with everyone,” Emma explains. Sounds like a friendship jackpot!

Now, you might be thinking, “Wait, should I categorize my friends?” [Slow down](https://reconstruct.ideaparticles.com/online-bubble-wrap-popper.html), champ! It’s not about labeling. It’s about understanding different friendship dynamics. Some thrive on daily chats. Others? They can pick up right where they left off after months of silence.

Interesting, right? But here’s where it gets even juicier.

Friendships are like investments, but way more unpredictable. If we had a Friendship Charts Satisfaction Index (sadly, we don’t), it’d be all over the place!

So why bother juggling multiple friendships? Great question!

# The Economics of Friendship

1. friendship economics is unique. It’s not about quantity. It’s about quality and rarity. Think about your childhood bestie. Years might pass, but when you meet? It’s like no time has passed at all. That’s the magic of shared history.

2. Life stages matter too. Your college party buddy might not fit into your new parent life. And that’s okay!

3. [Patience](https://reconstruct.ideaparticles.com/color-me-now.html) is key. Some friendships are slow burners. That work colleague? In 10 years, they might be your closest confidant. You never know!

*So, what’s the takeaway? Friendships evolve. We evolve. It’s all part of the game. Don’t pressure yourself to maintain every friendship at maximum intensity. It’s not realistic, and honestly? It’s not necessary.*

# Embracing Diverse Friendships

Embrace the diversity of your friendships. Prioritize without guilt. The best friendships? They understand and grow with you, no matter what category they fall into.

*Before you go, here’s a fun fact: anthropologist Robin Dunbar says humans can only maintain about 150 stable relationships. Mind-blown? Next time you’re scrolling through your contacts, remember: quality over quantity!*

Now, go share this with your friends (all categories welcome) on WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Spread the friendship wisdom!

Until next time, keep being an awesome friend – in your own unique way!

","ETA: should've worded the title more along the lines of ""before you moved into your first real home."" 

I go to a ""knit night"" at my local yarn store (crocheters welcome) and this was our preplanned discussion for the evening. Our group ages range from a college freshman to several people with grandkids in college so we got some really diverse/interesting answers

Brief and overly simplified historical context: when marriage also meant two young people moving into their own home for the first time, a trousseau generally referred to clothing and the linen (or anything really) that a woman and her family collected over the years to adorn her new home.

(I think some people/cultures still use the term trousseau, not a member of those cultures so I can't really speak to the modern day usage)

Focusing on the ""gathering items for a first home"" aspect, what sort of things would you create for a trousseau? Either your own or a loved one's.

One girl said she'd make a matching tablecloth, coasters for the coffee table, towel for the front of the oven, and throw pillows for the couch since everything is open concept now and she'd want it all to match, but you can't really buy a set like that. I thought that was so creative and I keep thinking about what this tradition would look like modernized if it had stuck around more

I LOVE hiking and camping, and recently have gotten into into fitness/strength training. My ideal hangs could be going to antique malls, going out dancing or to a drag show (always looking for a friend to go to Jellyfish or Blue Moon with), trying a new restaurant or a new recipe at home, grabbing coffee or a drink (I drink socially but am down for sober hangs too), going on a nature walk in a city park or a day trip to a state park, crafting or playing a board game, going to a show for live music, watching movies, etc. I did a lot of photography in the Philly DIY music scene pre-pandemic and kinda want to get back into that too. 

I’m married (monogamous) and childless (although I do pretty much consider my 2 cats my children).

1i5j9zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i5j9zl/the_stranger_from_the_car/,The Stranger From the Car ,"*Thanksgiving break was approaching and I decided to stay on campus alone, only I wasnt as alone as I thought.*

What I'm about to tell you may seem wild and imaginative and to some maybe unbelievable. But what I'm about to tell you it's completely true. Thinking back on it, I kind of wish it was something I imagined in my head. But it wasn't, and to this day it still sticks with me as a defining moment in my life. Along with the rest of the strange events that happened, after I first encountered The Stranger from the Car.

Fast forward 5 years from the first encounter with this stranger, this intruder who stalked me over a weekend alone while my parents were away. I was Now 20 at the time and attending college, residing in a dorm on campus. Thanksgiving was just a few days away and mostly everyone I knew including my roommate were leaving campus.

My Parents decided to take a cruise for the week of Thanksgiving, and the thought of seeing my Grandparents who I believe still despise me for the holiday sounded dreadful. So I decided I'd Stay on campus and eat thanksgiving dinner in the cafeteria. Only I expected others to stay and do the stay at least, But much to my surprise It was only Me and Our Campus Security, Officer Jenkins who would remain on campus for the week along with a few of the Kitchen staff to make a small thanksgiving meal for Anyone who Stayed behind.

Thanksgiving break began rather uneventfully. I was used to the hustle and bustle of college life, but now, with most of the students off campus and the grounds practically empty, it felt as if the world had shrunk to just me and the looming shadows stretching across the buildings. I was beginning to feel bored and lonely, and I couldn't call my parents who were in the middle of international waters at this point.

Officer Jenkins, the older security guard with a gruff exterior and an almost paternal sense of vigilance, I was the only person on campus. We'd exchanged small talk in the cafeteria as we ate our solitary Thanksgiving meal, but even his presence couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. The same feeling I'd had that weekend 5 years ago when my parents went away for my dads work trip.

It all started on the second night of break, around 12pm. I walked back towards my dorm from the library, for some reason, campus super dark as all of the security lights are timed to turn off at midnight. I had been in so late to finish my paper that now, for the first time, I realized how dark and isolated it all was. A light breeze whipped up fallen leaves, carrying with it an air crisp with oncoming winter. As I passed the parking lot near the edge of campus, I saw a car that looked like it was out of place. It was parked toward the far end, running, but with its headlights off.

At first, I didn't think much of it. There were plenty of empty cars this time of year, but it wasn't common for someone to park and leave their car running. But then, as I continued walking, something made me glance back. Just as I glanced back I noticed a figure sat in the driver's seat, just behind the wheel, motionless, as if they were waiting. My breath caught in my throat.

I began to walk more quickly, telling myself it was nothing, I was just paranoid. But as I reached the stairwell to the dorm, the feeling of eyes on me was unmistakable. I turned my head sharply, catching a glimpse of something behind me. It was the car that had been there but now without a person behind in the drivers seat. Nothing moved, there was only an empty car, yet a presence I could feel. That crawling sensation of something gave rise to the hair on the back of my neck.

I got settled into my Dorm and called the main office and got ahold of Officer Jenkins, but after he patrolled the campus he called me back to let me know much to my surprise that the car I had saw was no longer there.

By the fourth night, I'd had enough. My mind kept drifting back to that first incident with the man in the car, how his face was indistinguishable in the dark, how the impression of his gaze was always on me though I could never catch a proper glimpse of him.

I went to see Officer Jenkins, whose office was tucked behind the main office desk in the campus building, always kept in dim lighting with old coffee cups and papers strewn about. He sat behind the desk, thick glasses perched low on his nose as he flipped through a binder of incident reports.

Hey, Officer Jenkins,"" I started, looking around in a somewhat paranoid fashion as if someone might be listening. ""There's something weird going on. I keep seeing this car parked at the same spot at night, and… I don't know. It's been creeping me out. I know you said It was gone by the time you checked but I still have the feeling of being watched at night.

Jenkins didn't look up from his binder. ""It's just you and me on campus, kid. Everyone else's gone. Could be a late night driver or someone visiting the place. There's nothing to worry about.""

His words were supposed to reassure me, but they didn't. I wasn't sure if he was trying to ease my fears or just brushing it off, but I knew what I had seen.

That night, the air was heavier, more smothering. I walked in the dark back from the cafeteria to my dorm, my heart pounding with every step. When I reached the parking lot, the car was again there, waiting for me it seemed, like it had expected me. Its headlights beaming, casting eerie shadows across the empty lot.

I took a deep breath and told myself that this was it, that this was something that I had to face. This wasn't paranoia, I knew instinctively that there was something not quite right here. I drew closer to the car, my mind racing through all the options. The closer I came, the heavier my sense of foreboding felt.

Then I saw it.

The figure in the car was seated in the driver's seat, his face obscured by the darkness. It was that same feeling from before. That cold, unnerving presence.

I felt frozen, my body unable to react. It wasn't until I heard the faint sound of footsteps behind me that I snapped out of it. I whipped around, panic surging through me as I saw Officer Jenkins walking toward me, his flashlight cutting through the darkness.

""You alright, kid?"" he asked, his voice calm but laced with a hint of concern.

I opened my mouth to say something but nothing came out. I was too scared to say what I had known all along. The terrifying truth, that the stranger wasn't lurking in the shadows. They were following me, watching me. And worse, they had been on campus this whole time.

Officer Jenkins stepped forward and laid the beam of his flashlight on the car. The figure was gone. The headlights were off, and the car was silent now, like it had never been there at all.

He sighed. ""You've been seeing things, I think. It's just us here, and that's the way it's gonna be for the rest of the week. Now, go on and get some sleep. You're overthinking this.""

But I knew, deep down, that Officer Jenkins didn't believe me. He didn't see the same things I had. The figure, the car it was all real. And the stranger wasn't gone.

I went back to my dorm that night, but I couldn't shake this feeling that someone was out there, waiting for me. With Officer Jenkins on campus, it no longer felt safe. It wasn't the isolation but the creeping feeling that somewhere in the dark corners of campus, the stranger from the car was still watching. And this time, I didn't think I'd be able to escape them.

It was the last night of Thanksgiving break, and at around 1:30am, I was awakened by the a familiar yet blood-curdling sound. Beep-beep! I had heard it before years ago, only this time it was different and more insistent, almost frantic. I sat up in bed, my heart racing. I ran to my dorm window and looked out.

There it was again, the same car parked in the parking lot, its headlights cutting through the darkness. But this time, the horn was blowing, like he was really laying on it. I felt confused and a little scared as I quickly reached for my phone and dialed the front desk to try to get Officer Jenkins on the line. But as I waited, the line was silent, dead. My pulse quickened. That couldn't be right. The phones had worked fine just hours before.

I frustratedly threw the phone down and then bolted from my room toward the main office, in hopes Jenkins could assist me. The silence of the halls seemed to elevate every step that I took as being very loud and conspicuous. As I neared the large entryway glass doors, my eyes caught something.

A figure stood in the shadowed hallway outside the dorm through the glass, his eyes fixed on mine. It was him, the man from the car. He didn't move, just stared. It was as if his presence froze time. I stepped backward, my breath catching in my throat, but he didn't stop. He slowly reached for the door handle.

The panic swelled in. I swung around and ran, my feet pounding against the cold tile floor. I couldn't think straight. My mind was racing with the thought of something terrible about to happen. As I ran down the empty Hallways I could Hear his footsteps closely behind me. I burst into my room, clicked the door shut behind me, and dropped onto the floor to try to steady my breathing.

The handle shook. My heart stopped. It was him. Rattle-Rattle. Bang-Bang! This went on for a solid 4 minutes and then silence. I held my breath and listened. Seconds passed, then minutes. The door didn't open, Was he still out there, or had he moved on? I didn't hear a sound, so I sat up and walked slowly towards the door of my dorm. I pressed my ear against the door to listen in hopes of hearing if he was still there. Thats when I heard it, the same voice that mutters Hmm as I was pressed behind that Christmas tree box in the closet all those years ago. Only this time it muttered ever so softly; I will Always find you.

Just then for a split second, my heart skipped a beat and I froze in complete fear. I fell to the floor, hands pressed behind me to keep myself up. All I could do was stare at the door, not knowing what had just happened. Minutes passed as just sat in complete silence staring at the door, when once again I was startled by a stern knock. Knock-Knock-Knock! ""You okay in there kid?"" Officer Jenkins shouted out.

I sat up quickly and opened my dorm door. I'd never been so happy to see Officer Jenkins before in my life, yet there I was so relieved to see him! I ran into his arms and shouted, I've never been so glad to see you! He was he here, he was trying to get in my dorm!

Much to my surprise Jenkins witnessed him running out of the hallway door and getting into his car, quickly peeling out of the parking lot in panic as he shined his flashlight in his direction. ""He's gone kiddo, and the authorities are on the way"" he said sternly!

The Morning slowly rolled in, and after a brief time of filing Was he indeed the same person who had broken into my house all those years ago? Why Me? Unfortunately, this would not be my last encounter with the stranger from the car...

PS their coffee is NOT freshly roasted (8 months +) and the only thing they care about is opening new cafes despite all of the equipment and infrastructure failures of existing cafes.
Also ZERO quality control at the cafe level.

1i5j5cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i5j5cw/she_is_almost_dead/,She is almost dead,"Dear \*\*\*\*\*\*,

We dated for almost two years. I know I was your first kiss, your first girlfriend, your first time, your first everything. I know you were 20, and you wanted the youthful college experience of sleeping around and dating a bunch of girls. Even knowing that I still love you. Not the ""we are dating"" type of love, the ""I think you are an amazing person and I understand this is what will make you happy, so I will always be there for you when you need me"" type of love. The ""you deserve everything the world has to offer and I hope that when you go to sleep at night you are smiling"" kind of love. Even now, I don't blame you for leaving because I wouldn't have wanted you to feel trapped or unhappy. I get that every day that passed was one where you wondered if you were making the right choice without having any other comparisons, scared, unsure, lost, and confused. After the breakup, you lied and omitted information, and said some of the most hurtful words, but I was clingy, and obsessive and disregarded a lot of boundaries for 3 months. We both made mistakes. But I don't think you ever grasped how this whole experience was for me, and I would never try to sit you down and tell you in real life when I know you are happy with someone else. I genuinely love that for you. I just want to lay it all out here, I think after that I will feel completely at ease.

The truth is when I found out about the other girls and realized that you were ready for relationships mentally (I decided to try only being friends before this out of respect for your mental health needs) I looked past the hookups and the dates you had and knew I still wanted you in my life. I went out and bought a birthday gift where every component was something sentimental and a tribute of our time together. Your favorite coffee I would always buy and surprise you with, a birthday cake protein shake because you love the gym, muji stationery and notebooks for your art, mini chess set because we played it when we first met, the chocolate my dad gave me that we ate while I slept over at your place our first holiday, the shortbread cookies you gifted me two days before breaking up with me, some gifts for your sister who was visiting the U.S., and more that I can't even remember. I asked if you were free on November 22nd, do you remember that? If I could walk over to your dorm to give you your birthday gift. You and I didn't know it but this question, this day, is where our lives came to a crossroads. If you had said yes, I was going to march to your place and confess how I know you had done all of these things and that you were unsure because I was your first, but I loved you and would continue to love and cherish you for as long as you'd let me. Show you the gifts and explain that we had made all of these memories together and I just know that we could live such a great and adventure-filled life if only you'd give this another chance. You said no, that you were busy getting a haircut and then going to the club with your friends.

The next day at my shared birthday party which I had invited you to (the other person didn't have you on the guest list out of respect for me), I got the pleasure of finding out that you were with the ""friend you are not attracted to whatsoever and will never have any interest in"", and you both got drunk, and she asked you out, and you said yes. I went home and wrote a card saying how much I care about you as a friend and how I would support you in whatever journey made you happy, told you to come to my place the next morning, and handed it to you with the gift and the excuse that it was a lot, but it was something I bought a long time ago while we were still dating. This was the day you told me that ""our relationship was good, but you wanted to see if there was better."" I was devastated, and heartbroken, but after the anger faded there was not a single ounce of bitterness or malice in my thoughts. After all that, genuinely, the only thoughts in my head were ""You are so amazing and I want you to be happy, so if dating her instead is what you want then I will support it and try my best to get over you and eventually be just your friend."" ""I care about you so much and if you were ever in trouble or even just needed to talk I would still lend an ear."" And most disrespectful to myself of all, ""Maybe he'll realize he liked me more and want to try again."" I created a new philosophy.

All of our time together built a certain amount of love for you in my heart. I can't snap my fingers and make it disappear, but I will feel the negative emotions as they come, and as time passes it will lessen. I will keep this spot in my heart reserved for you for as long as I have it, and I will forgive even this and try again if you come back under certain conditions. I wouldn't accept her breaking up with you and then you crawling back to me as the second choice. But it is understandable you left out of fear because I was indeed your only partner at a time when people start deciding who they want to spend the rest of their lives with. You would need to realize on your own without any of my intervention that all of the new experiences you made were not what you wanted. That you had tried them, but in doing so realized that it was the greatest mistake of your life, that you now saw the same value and rarity in our relationship that I did. Were sure you would die with no regrets if we spent our remaining time from the most mundane days to our greatest adventures together. I am more than aware that this will never happen, but I don't want to pretend that the girl with this love in her heart doesn't exist. I know that one day, the girl with the vacant spot in her heart will die, that the love and emotions I am letting naturally ebb and flow will completely drain away. But I didn't want to lie to myself and say that this little spot isn't there because it is. It is a part of me and I am not going to suppress it or hate it. It is okay to still feel this way, it is natural because I truly unconditionally love you.

You didn't notice but every day after I sent that ""goodbye"" email I put down a block to build the foundation of a girl who would be completely content and fulfilled with herself. I took this break as a chance to discover all of the positive things I have going for me outside of a relationship in my life. I love myself now, I am beautiful, funny, smart, and confident; once intimidating things barely phase me anymore. I love my friends and am putting in time to become closer to all of them. Outside of a recent medical issue that messed up some eating and sleeping (which I am getting treated) my mental health and emotional regulation are ironclad, my identity is rock solid, my belief system is sound, and I have a newfound love for the world. I'm building relationships with my family and finding joy and love in my home, a place that used to be the largest strain on my mental health. I never once thought of these changes as revenge or in spite of you leaving, but rather was really proud of them and hoped one day I would get the chance to show you how far I've come. That one day I could use these newfound tools to build an even stronger and healthier bond with you. I was not delusional though, I always assumed that you were perfectly content in your new relationship and this was never going to happen, and I was more than comfortable with the idea of never being with you again. Not by distracting myself with another person I knew I was not ready for, but by learning how to be happy by myself.

I liked the new dynamic of me letting you be and only responding to the times when you wanted to reach out. My love for you as a partner is almost completely gone, that spot in my heart is barely open, but even when it completely disappears I have always cared for and loved you as a person. I would want to be as close to you as you wanted me in your life. My romantic love and love for you as a person have always been completely separate. I liked being a friend, but until more time has passed and we both truly moved on, one that would only be there when called upon. But every time that you have assumed that I was hung up on your girlfriend, that you said I could confide in you and then after hearing it get weirded out and withdraw, when you act in a way that shows you have no regard or respect for me as a person, my love for you as a person dies. My care for you as a human being at all dies. It has been dying at a rapid rate. At this moment, enough time has passed where my romantic love is almost drained which is good and what I wanted, but simultaneously my interactions with you have butchered and maimed almost all of the positive light that I viewed you in. You are almost no longer the same person I would have cared for and supported unconditionally in life, but even still I am almost certain that this is a protective outer persona you have draped around yourself in a time of great struggle. I have a feeling you aren't doing the best right now mentally and I am truly very worried for you, I wish you the best. You know you can always reach out if you aren't, no matter what has gone on in the past.

I love my past self, the one who will love and support you unconditionally. But unless something changes or I find out that these actions really are a protective shield from the world I know that very soon she will be completely dead. I know you'll never read this but if fate somehow brought you here and you made it through the whole thing, if you did indeed resonate with any of these words, I would act pretty quickly. You have something so rare: someone who wholeheartedly and unconditionally loves you. Not the ""I love you because you are family"" love, or the ""I love you romantically because you are my partner"" love, or the ""I love you platonically because you are a good friend"" love. I love you as a person unconditionally, no matter what. Even after everything we both know has occurred during the breakup I still love you, you can make the most horrific mistake and that would never break this love for you. And this isn't easy on me, it is not something I enjoyed developing. It is completely raw and vulnerable and it lets you feel the greatest passion but hits you with the deepest sorrow. It is the most cherished but weakest part of me.

Don't misinterpret this, it is not out of insecurity or low self-worth. I love myself and know I can easily meet someone else who will love and cherish me and do all the things in a relationship that you did. It is not out of idealization or romanticization either. We both have our negative characteristics and the relationship was far from perfect. But I have to acknowledge that after spending time with you and getting to know the beautiful and flawed person you are, I love you and would want nothing more than to spend the rest of my life with you. And at some point, you had seen the best and worst of me and said that you loved me too. Against all rhyme or reason I, as someone who was taught since birth that vulnerability is weakness and love isn't real, feel a love for you with no terms and conditions, one that is given even when nothing is to be gained by the giver. I wish someone felt that for me. But with the way things are going now, she is almost dead.

This is my last letter to you,

Me

I initially thought my partner was messing with me but I started noticing things wouldn’t be where I left them while I was alone in the room. For example, I left my hat on my bed, went into the washroom, came out and it was on the washroom’s door handle.

I'm working towards creating a ""In-Person Secular/Non-12 Step Recovery Group"" here in Salem which would meet 1-4 times a month. Nothing against AA, but there are plenty of meetings out there for folks who want to work that path. However, many people can recover with other programs, which aren't spiritual/religious or 12-step based, like I have. Good Sub-Reddits on it too.

Essentially, I'd like to get outside, 3rd party insight into the Pros and Cons of this (mostly Cons). I have outlined my own, but won't post them as I'd rather collect unvarnished thoughts from others (I may edit this later with a full update of the P&C's).

As far as I know, there isn't a solid in-person Secular meeting in town. There are a couple Recovery Dharma meetings (technically not Secular, plus the 4 Noble Truths + the 8 Fold path is 12. Hahaha.) and a couple SMART meetings at ROCC, but those are weekday days. If you know of anything else, please post!

I have LifeRing and SMART approvals processing. I also know there is Secular AA. My home group in another state was Secular AA. Pretty good one too! Welbriety is another formal group and there are more.

I appreciate your insight in advance! If it DOES take off (it may not) and you are interested...I'll update with details here (time, place, etc). If you are interested in connecting over a recovery coffee, my DM is open.

Till right now when I feel my ribs crying out in a muddy sobbing pain, it's like the cold, gloomy weather of London streets, that look sophisticated, brick and mortar choked by the grey clouds and caressed by cold numbing winds. 

It's like if a tree dried up showing no signs of life. No leaves on it. No greenery. The bark, the branches all shriveled up, twisted, dead, rotten and hollow, easy to break yet alive. Not even a bird sits on it. That's what my insides feel. 

I feel so sad. Depressed. That the only solace I have from pain is my bed, hiding under a blanket, unable to face the world and it's ego, it's lostness, every little thing irritates me if I fail in it. Every failed attempt I can feel my soul becoming dead. Dead! 

I sleep and even in it I get no comfort. No rejuvenation. I cry with a deep sadness, locked in my mind. In another world built up to torment me. Just now when I slept I saw a dream, walling with my mom, to a temple not having the will to walk to it. I thought why don't I go then I pictured how crowded it is.... masses pushed. Suddenly I was trusted inside in a line. A small girl told me something and I seemed to care for her and I told her to go ahead and I lost her. 

Then I felt lost. No money. I saw a man cooking and I wanted food but I couldn't buy it.  Now I hear my mother deal with sone loan sharks. But in another dream, I saw a man so depressed he took a plane, just like case of the guy who flew around in a stolen plane and crashed it, killing himself. 

I'd like to do that. I'd like to fly a plane, go above the clouds hover above till my fuel ran out and crash and die. I was at his funeral. His sister. His family, although they were morbidly obese.....maybe in my mind food is a coping mechanism..... as I've seen with others that coffee or sugar is a food coping mechanism. 

I feel lost, I cried cause I could feel him. I cried in my sleep. As I do often.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/C9ge0G3bo4) **Aug 7, 2022**

I have an almost three year old beautiful little girl. She’s just a few weeks shy of her third birthday. My baby was out in hospice four weeks ago after having gone into remission late May. Unfortunately, the cancer has returned except it is now crushing her optic nerve and is about 8cm long. Multiple doctors recommended we make our daughter as comfortable as possible as they do not believe removing the tumor is a good option. I have so much to say in regards to her diagnosis but heartbroken will suffice for now.

My husband and I have been making tons of memories with her for the past few weeks. We’ve included family in some of these memories but we both feel that we want to spend as much time with our daughter as possible. My mother in law called me yesterday to tell me she booked tickets/hotel/airfare for a trip next month. I thought it sounded fun until she said she was taking our toddler with her. Just her, my daughter, and her husband. She did not invite my husband and I.

My daughter isn’t even three yet. She has never stayed overnight anywhere and mother in law wants to take her for one entire week across the country, alone. I suggested that my husband and I both go that way our daughter is comfortable and for gods sake in the event she dies? She can’t be gone for a week. Her nurses are here. Her care is here.

I suggested what if we all go for a shorter amount of time. I came up with various suggestions to which all were turned down. I should add that if my daughter was not in hospice I still would not be comfortable with our toddler being across the country for a week alone without her parents. My child being in hospice adds another layer of complexity to the situation. 

I told my mother in law that her decisions that she made alone without consulting us was a solid no. She called me a few names and hung up on me. She then called my husband and called me a few names and suggested she would fight for rights before my daughter dies. 

I’m already grieving. My husband said we should acquiesce to his mothers trip to avoid drama (even though he agrees that our daughter is too young). But I want to spend time with her before the cancer takes her, she’s too little etc. I said no for various reasons not just to say no.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**beingboring**

>NTA - i cannot fathom this, and i know your MIL is grieving as well, but this is not the way for her to handle it.  i know internet words ring hollow, but please stay strong and love the heck out of that little girl for as long as you can!

**OOP**

>>Thank you! Mil is definitely grieving. I have suggested to her various times that she seek someone else to grieve to/vent to because she often believes and acts like our grief is the same and that she’s going to “have a mothers broken heart.” My therapist has also told me that her and I are not in the same circle of grief. Even my own mother doesn’t act like that. My own mother has even told me she cannot fathom being in my shoes because she’s never lost a child. It’s a twisted twisted situation and I feel like when my daughter is gone I want to be as far away from this family as possible, my husband included.

**~**

**guessmyageidareyou**

>NTA 

>First I'm heartbroken for you. Second, regardless of health, a 3 year old isn't really ready for a week long trip without mom and dad. Add to the fact that she's in hospice, and she has needs that MIL could not possibly provide on her ""vacation"". Your MIL is not entitled to what I'm sure she calls ""hEr BaBy""

**OOP**

>>She has said on multiple occasions that “no one is going to miss her baby as much as she is.” I just sit there thinking what is going to happen when my daughter passes and I’m falling apart. Who’s going to hold me up? Right now my daughter is my motivation. But once she’s gone I don’t even foresee myself being able to get up out of bed. I’ve been a stay at home mommy to my daughter for her entire life. I left my career to be at home with her. I don’t even remember what my life was like before I had my baby. I feel like mother in law is going to make my daughters death about her and I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle it.

**~**

**mercersher**

>NTA & tell your husband to get his s&&t together. You don’t take a 3 year old on hospice on vacation without their parents.  My heart breaks for you, I’m so sorry your MIL is adding stress to this situation.

**OOP**

>>Him and I had a discussion this morning while our daughter was still asleep. I told him that I currently do not foresee myself staying married to him once my daughter is gone. Not after this. Not if he doesn’t stand up for his daughter, his wife, and our family. He looked pretty shocked. But I’m pretty set on not having anything to do with his family and him included. I thought him and I were a team, but he’s been spineless with his mom most of our marriage and I’m usually the one who is setting boundaries. I think my daughter having cancer and being in hospice is what broke this camels back.

**OOP Added this comment about her daughters illness**

>I’m so sorry for the loss of your child. Soon I will be part of that club that no one wants to be a part of. Maybe if you’re okay with it I can message you and ask more questions. It’s all a blur. 

>There have been so many comments and I haven’t been able to reply to all of them. But yours stood out because my daughter has RMS (rhabdomyosarcoma) which was first discovered in her foot. She had beat stage 4 cancer and relapsed a month later. In fact Wednesday will be one month that she relapsed. We’ve been given six to eight weeks. We started morphine last week so that’s been tough. We are still managing to do fun things with her despite her illness. A great company gifted us a little wagon so we’re able to take her to Disneyland, museums, fairs, etc.  

>You’re right about memories being etched in your brain. The last year and a half has been a journey. The last four weeks have been bittersweet. I don’t even like to sleep because I’m afraid I’ll miss out. My baby is sleeping now so I feel comfortable reading through my messages but even then here I am laying next to her. I haven’t left her side. I can’t. I don’t want to miss the small moments, either. The way she breathes to the way she snores at night. It’s so much in such a little amount of time and I’m worried I’m going to miss it if I even take a nap. Let alone a weeks long trip without me. 

>I told my husband today that I am going no contact with his mother. It’s not fair to me to deal with her while enjoying my daughter while simultaneously preparing myself for her death and life after. 

>But I’m not going to leave her side. I’ll be right here till the very end.

**And what her daughters hospice nurses thought of the situation**

>I told two of our hospice nurses and they both were floored. They thought I was joking and they were both appalled that I was being serious. My husband even told one of the nurses “well my mom has good intentions.” My daughters care team, including three doctors do not recommend we fly. They also do not recommend that we are gone for that long without care. I asked them to document everything. It’s been a crazy day and I’m shocked I managed to eat one meal.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts and insights. I appreciate the outpouring of messages and I’m sorry I haven’t had a chance to reply to them all.

I wanted to add a few things. My mother in law lives in the same county as us. In the same city as my parents. It’s only about a 20 minute drive without traffic. However, my in laws have always been very adamant that we visit them. So I usually take my daughter over every other week for a few hours for a visit. Rarely do they ever come to our home. My parents like to visit and always have. My daughter is much closer to my parents for this reason. Anytime my husband and I go to date nights my parents come over and watch her because they like for her to be in her comfort zone. This is before the cancer. Since the cancer diagnosis we’ve been in and out of the hospital for weeks at a time. My parents have still been very much involved with helping but I’m the form of dropping off meals, helping with laundry, etc. I’m very close to my family and my family has been very respectful of us needing space as a family during this time. I think my in laws may be expediting guilt because they haven’t made much of an effort yo visit us, see us, or accommodate us. It’s always about what I, their daughter in law can do for them. Have always felt like an incubator who’s just there to facilite a relationship between them and my child. 

Also, to add, I am set on distancing myself as much as I can. I’ve cut off contact with my mil and I do not want her around after this fiasco. I’ve completely blocked her from my phone and I communicated this to my husband. He is sad but says he understands. 

A few of you mentioned that this was an eye opening situation and it really has been. On many levels.


Second edit: I saw various commands about mother in law possibly wanting to taking my child on a trip to get her alternative treatment. Mother in law planned to take my child to Disney World in Florida which is across the country from where we live. Mother in law lives in the same state, in the same county as us. My husband and I have taken our child to Disneyland a few times in her life and most recently once. Going for one day was exhausting, and my daughter was spent after the day. I can’t imagine my daughter handling Disney world for more than a day but also I would like to be there for said trip. Even if my child wasn’t dying I would still not be comfortable with her going without me. It’s such a bizmare situation. Mother in law isn’t one for alternative treatments and I haven’t out right asked her but I wouldn’t be shocked at this point. Either way, my child isn’t going anywhere with her. Supervised or not. I’ve already made that clear to my husband. She wants to come and visit it will have to be at our home. Even then I’m still not on board after everything that has transpired. I’ve been thinking really deeply the last few months but even more so in the last 24 hours.  I don’t know how I can continue being part of this family. I’m trying not to think too far ahead but I’m seriously doubting continuing on in this marriage. Thank you again everyone.

Third edit: I am really close with my family, specifically my mom and aunt. They know the wishes I have for my daughter. My husband and I argued about where our daughter should be buried for a good week. It was awful. He wanted her buried with his grandma and where his parents and him will be buried. I wanted her buried at the cemetery my grandparents are buried at and where I plan to be buried at. My husband is in the military so I’m confused as to why he does not want to be buried with his combat brothers but that’s entirely up to him. After this fiasco with his mother I put my foot down about where I would like my daughters final resting place to be. I just never thought it would be so much back and forth about where she will get buried, the week long trip we weren’t invited on or consulted about, and acquiescing his mothers wishes. Shit show to say the least. I love my husband but I am appalled by his behavior. I should also add that my family was very supportive about where I wanted my daughter to be buried at when the topic came up. They even said wherever we want because it’s not their choice. I even entertained cremation just to try and come to a middle ground of sorts. I didn’t even want to discuss burials and cremations until I absolutely had to. I’ve been avoiding it. Now it feels morbid to discuss it because my daughter is still alive. My husbands family was upset when they brought the topic up. Because I didn’t automatically want my daughter at their cemetery of choice. Their main argument was that my daughter carries their last name so she should go there. My argument was my family already has four open plots and I want to make one a double for me to be when my time comes. I’m even exhausted writing this. Because this is my life and it shouldn’t be. We should be a team. United in grief. Now I feel like all I have is my baby and my family to hold me up.

**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**


[Final Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/vEKV6hhMnc)  **Aug 14, 2022 (1 week later)**

Edit: it’s been a few days since I’ve been online and I’ve read some of the messages. Truly, thank you to everyone who has sent their warm wishes, support, encouragement, etc. It’s been very touching and I’m so grateful. My daughter has begun slowly deteriorating and it’s become all very overwhelming. My husband now realizes that this time is precious. That we are on borrowed time and that our time (mom and dad) is the most important time. We’ve had two sessions of grief counseling/couples counseling while my daughter sleeps. Our therapist has really helped us both understand how borrowed our time is and how this time truly is for us. Everyone else is secondary. Not to say that extended family isn’t important. They are but there is allot of extended family. A lot. However, I’m not sure I will be staying married in the long run. Although, this isn’t the time to make such a deep decision. I am emotionally drained from all that has transpired not only this past week but this past year. You truly see peoples true colors when shit hits the fan. An example of this is on my phone I have eight different alarms each day for my daughter for all of the medication she takes daily. Daily. I have been the one who flushes ports, administers medication, cleans up vomit, gives back rubs, and the like. I have been in this through the thick of it. Having to learn everything. Because no one else will. My mother has been the only person who has asked how I’m doing. Who has brought me coffee, meals, held me when I’ve cried, who’s been a rock. My husband will sometimes be emotional present but usually he’s not. Other than my mother I have never received a text from any other family asking how I’m doing or how they can help. Like I said earlier I see everybody’s true colors. My focus right now is my baby. I will focus on the rest when the time comes. But for now we are surviving and we are trying our best. 

Thank you again

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/aAIhO66vzw)  **Dec 15, 2020**

I live in an apartment with three cats. My cats have their litter robot and cat wheel in the living room and a cat tree in my bedroom. In mid-November, Christine asked to crash on my couch as she was in between leases and she said had nowhere else to go. She made no mention of other hardships or issues. She knew that I have 3 cats and that I usually work ~70 hrs a week.

During Christine's visit, she caused the cats to get sick by giving them milk and cream. I asked her not to feed the cats anything and the next day, Christine threw out almost $70 worth of cat toys, tried to throw out the cat wheel because it didn't match the aesthetic of my living room, gave the cats milk which led to diarrhea, and then refused cat access to the litter robot, locking them in my bedroom. After 4 days of this, I had enough and demanded that she return the key and leave immediately. After she left, I discovered that she had ruined the cat tree as well.

A week ago, Christine began photos of my cats on her social media insinuating that they are hers. She mentioned that she had stayed with me and that I had kicked her out when she was in intense pain due to a miscarriage, so she had to move in with her parents, who live nearby. However, the one good thing is that apparently, my cats inspired her to get her own, who apparently look exactly like mine and if my cats were named Apple, Pencil, and Daisy, then hers are named Banana, Eraser, and Rose.

I commented that these are my cats and that I had only let her stay because she lied that she had nowhere else to go, as I'm high-risk and we're in the middle of a pandemic and otherwise, I wouldn't have let her stay at my apartment. I also said that she had gotten herself kicked out by abusing my cats, and then started listing expenses and damage costs and asked when she could reimburse me for the damages that had occured. She responds that the photos are of HER cats, she can't afford to pay me back, that she's a responsible pet owner because she did a week of research, and I responded by linking my cats' Instagram and saying that a responsible pet owner is anyone but her.

The next day, I got several threatening messages from her family about not believing Christine about the miscarriage or cats. I responded that I was unaware of the miscarriage at the time and was only looking out for my cats. I also mentioned that I doubted the miscarriage had happened, as she had lifted and carried the heavy wheel and base down two flights of stairs. On top of that, she had gone out for the entire day and had been drinking coffee. The messages are saying that I better make sure my cats are safe because I'm a terrible pet owner and person for not helping Christine and that apparently, I don't have any friends because I'm a crazy cat lady.

AITA for prioritizing my cats over another human? I understand the upset...but only if she actually did have the miscarriage? Maybe she did and I'm the AH.

Also, cat tax here: https://imgur.com/a/AVRcmVL

edit: wow, this blew up way more than I thought it would. After reading all the comments, I realize that I'm nta. I think I was thrown off because I felt like my cats suffered which made me an AH in their eyes and I was projecting because I've had two miscarriages and if anyone ever started doubting me and trying to get others to doubt me, I would be devastated. I appreciate all the comments and I'm trying to respond to them all but there's a ton! I did want to link this [video of my youngest cat running on a wheel](https://imgur.com/gallery/s-p-e-e-d-BbA4yEZ) as additional cat tax. He's showing my tabby kitty how it's done :)

edit pt.2: things escalated a ton last night. Had to call the police to intervene and while I can't say much about it yet, I will try to post an update when things blow over.

edit #3: i apologize for not responding to comments - I'm still reading them and appreciate the advice and support. There have been a couple people messaging me asking if they can repost this on their YouTube video/Instagram etc and at this time, I'd like to ask for people to refrain from doing so, especially as the police had to get involved and I'm now just really worried that Christine or family will find this post. Like I said in my last edit - I will update when things blow over but for now, I am safe, as are the kitties!

>>I feel terrible. She says that im not entitled to the knowledge that she was miscarrying when she was in my apartment. I agreed but added that miscarrying doesn't excuse her hurting my cats and messing with their stuff, which led to everyone saying that she's having a hard time and they're ""annoying"" and I was like ""then she didn't have to stay? Or keep giving them milk""

**how did OOP not know her friend was crazy**

>When she gave them cream, I asked her to stop feeding them and I thought that was the issue. She was upset that I didn't call out of work for her and I assumed it was because she wanted to spend time together as we were friends. I didn't know about the milk until the day she decided to throw stuff and remove the cat wheel and I kicked her out basically the next day. I didn't find out about the miscarriage until last week when she started posting the photos. C has been questionable in the past but it's always been little things, like saying that she had salad for lunch when she had pizza. Perhaps I missed a bunch of red flags but I also work a ton (essential jobs) and I'm not home for most of the day.

>To clarify, she stayed for a total of 3.5 days. The 3rd day was when she messed with the stuff. I let her stay the night but told her she needed to be out by 10am the next day.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/butterflyclover/s/59SlhTyOZE)  **Apr 14, 2021 (4 months later)**

Hey everyone,

It’s been a while but here is my update lol. Unfortunately, the subreddit wouldn’t let me update in the sub, so I just posted it here.

A day or so after I posted the AITA post, Christine and her boyfriend tried to break in with a crowbar and a hammer... yikes. Fortunately, I had taken the night off of work and was actually responding to reddit comments when my neighbor texted asking if I knew that there were people outside my window? I had no idea. Police were called, and Christine told them that she had left her jacket in my apartment and was just trying to get it back. When I said there was no jacket here, she changed her story to me abusing the cats, but I feel that it’s abundantly clear that my cats do not get abused. Both of them (Christine and the boyfriend) were arrested, and I haven’t seen Christine since.

I was looking through some screenshots of Christine’s social media and to my horror, I realized that some of the photos were taken AFTER she moved out and that I wasn’t the one who took them. The cats had collars that I had gotten them for the holiday season, my Christmas tree that went up 12/6 was visible in some of the photos, and so on. The next thing I did was going through the footage that was recorded on my pet cams when I was at work and wasn’t surprised to find out that Christine has been letting herself into my apartment to take photos of my cats and eat my food. I submitted this to the police as a follow-up to the police report I had made.

Since then, my mental health has been on a rough ride. I did get the locks changed after the attempted break-in situation but realizing that Christine had been in my apartment multiple times without me knowing really threw me off. Christine never showed up at work again and there was a bit of gossip that she had ended up in an in-person psychiatric care facility. I didn’t know if she still had access to the schedule, and so my paranoia got pretty bad. I was also uncomfortable working with Christine's friends as my coworkers, so I ended up putting in my two-week notice in mid-January. I also decided I wanted to move, but it’s actually really really difficult finding a place that accepts three cats >.<

My move was finalized in late February and I was able to move in early March. I injured my wrist right before the move, so it took me 2 weeks longer to move (couldn’t move too much stuff at once) and that definitely stretched my savings because I was paying rent for two apartments, with 2 security deposits and such. But since then, I’ve been working and continuing therapy and outpatient psychiatric care. Maybe I’m a wuss but it was definitely a little traumatizing to realize how close I got to things turning out differently. Recently (late March), Christine messaged me asking if we could talk. I was hesitant but eventually, I called her and she apologized for scaring me and asked if we could still be friends. I said I didn’t know, because I no longer trust her, and she accepted that. We haven’t talked since. Still no clue what prompted the crazy but I don't want to know or have her around because in true crazy cat lady fashion, I only need my cats lol

If anyone wants to be linked to my instagram for the cats, feel free to dm me, I suppose? [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/cat-tax-pt-2-zUm1W87) is some more cat tax as well!

I told him I had a crush on him straight up back in mid October and we went to get coffee at one point and things went well but nothing progressed after that besides going out with friends downtown together.  We did this whole back and forth flirting but not doing anything about it for a few months and I told myself over winter break I’d not think about him and try to move on since he hadn’t made a legitimate move on me after my confession.  So when we come back to school it’s obvious to the point that our friend says “you guys are so cute” that we like each other or at least enjoy being around one another.  So I confess I’d like to see where things could go if he wanted to but I’d also be open to just staying friends and then he left me on read for two days and then we talked it out in person and he said he’d prefer to just staying friends because he didn’t want to ruin what we have in friendship which I appreciate but it still just sucks.

Apologies in advance for the length, I don’t expect many to read through this mess. 

I (32f) have a laundry list of mental health issues that have been deemed treatment resistant thus far (I’ve been on and off psych meds and in therapy since age 17) but in recent years, I’ve started coming to terms with having BPD yet I refuse to seek a proper diagnosis because I also suffer from anhedonic depression with extremely avoidant traits and knowing that therapy is the only real treatment option for personality disorders stops me from doing the hard work. This is just some background for context. 

Recently, within the last month+, I’ve formed an intensely intimate relationship with someone who I connected with on Reddit, in the anhedonia sub. The chain of events was quite random. I commented on a comment of his (I’m not sure exactly his age, anywhere from 34-37m) in some thread. It was something I gave maybe a moment of thought to before moving on. I’d have never thought about it again but…the user in question sent me a PM some time later, maybe days, maybe weeks, the timeline isn’t clear to me. 

For whatever reason, he must have had the boredom and curiosity to browse my Reddit history enough to understand that he and I both live in the same small country, and basically the same city. He messaged me in a purely platonic way. We were both interested in trying a specific medication to help anhedonia and we chatted for a while before deciding to switch to WhatsApp and as we continued chatting, it was becoming jarring how much we had in common. We planned to meet for coffee at one stage early on but I canceled because I had hit a low point mood-wise and it was really lovely to be able to just tell him that without lying or making an excuse. He didn’t make me feel bad. We continued on chatting most days, completely platonic. 

At this stage in the story, we have no idea how the other one looks and no reason for caring or wanting to know because that’s not why we were talking. Not only am I married, but he is experiencing a condition that renders him unable to have sex even if he wanted to, and he’s at a point right now where sex or even just dating are not things he can participate in for reasons mental and physical, he definitely didn’t message me with any kind of alterior motive. I believe he messaged me purely because we were seeking the same medication, had the same illness, and lived in the same area. 

At some point, things started changing. I believe we both started becoming sexually attracted to the way the other thought. The things he would say would turn me on because I found his intellect hot. We understand each other in such a deep way. We are just very in sync. Likewise, he began feeling things towards me that weren’t purely platonic.  

My mind and memory are a bit fucked so I can’t really be sure how things escalated and at what pace. We were extremely curious about every aspect of the other one. We began to exchange photos of our families, ourselves as kids and at some point, we learned how the other looks. 

Physically, we find each other beautiful. We are both objectively attractive enough. But it was that we already, for lack of better phrasing, wanted to fuck each other’s minds. Learning how the other looked just sealed the deal I think. We don’t fuck around with how we feel about things for better or worse so we weren’t coy. We were freaked out by the whole thing. The odds of it. We’re two people who barely leave home, feel no pleasure or reward in life, but suddenly we’re both feeling strong feelings again. 

My husband and I have been teetering on separation for a long time. We aren’t right for each other and we’ve been failing at making it work for far too long now. Divorce was on the table long before this chance encounter but I feel like I would finally take the leap and separate from my spouse just for the opportunity to be closer to this person, knowing full well that two sick people coming together, especially coupled with the intense lust and obsession we feel, could very well end in extreme pain. We are also both very moody and don’t do much to hide it. 

Today he said something to me like “you do realize you have borderline personality right?” and I said yes, I suspect as much. He went on to say that in getting to know me, he has realized he probably has it too (which is an assumption I tend to agree with).  

I guess I’m just looking for input. I know no one can really offer advice or help. Any feedback would be useful. ",1,1737348911.0,BPD,0,1.0,False
1i5ij6u,https://i.redd.it/midvebw5y2ee1.jpeg,Interprocimal cavity,"It seems that I have interproximal cavities on both teeth. The earliest I could get to my dentist is either end of this month or next month. I have been doing my best to take care of my teeth for the time being. I have switched to sensodyne rapid relief for my morning brushing, and 3m clinpro in the evening. I have switched to a round electric toothbrush as well and have done fluoride varnish.

I would like to ask: 

1. When doing fillings in front teeth, how big do they have to drill? Is it noticeable? Can they go through the back with this filling?

2. How easily does it stain? This is coming from a person who does bot smoke, drink tea, or coffee. But i do eat colored food (eg chicken with turmeric, cheetos, etc)

3. I am considering biomimetics since my dentist practices it. Are the materials used better than the usual composite?

My apologies for the long query as I have recently developed dental anxiety because of recent dental problems (it has come to a point that I have lost sleep just thinking about having fillings in my front teeth).

I hope any of you reading this could be of any help to me.

I’m 17, and I just had my first cup of coffee today. After reading the Word of Wisdom, I can’t understand why the Church enforces a strict rule against coffee when it doesn’t even mention it by name. Meanwhile, it clearly says to only eat meat in times of winter or famine, yet that part is completely ignored. Joseph Smith drank coffee—this isn’t speculation, it’s a fact—and he never forced anyone to strictly obey the Word of Wisdom. It wasn’t supposed to be a commandment, and the scripture even says it’s “not by commandment or constraint.”

It feels like the Church has twisted this into a control mechanism. They pick and choose which parts to enforce, and it doesn’t feel honest or consistent. Coffee is natural, healthy, and something God put on earth for our benefit. Why are we shamed for drinking it, but eating meat year-round is totally fine? This whole thing feels more about control than spiritual guidance, and it’s frustrating to see how far it’s been taken from what Joseph Smith originally taught it seems like the church lies about almost everything

For reference, I’m 5’4 and weigh 256. Female. Last July I weighed 275 but got sick with mono and dropped 15 pounds, and my New Year’s resolution is to lose 100 pounds this year, so I started the year at 260 and am down 4 pounds in two weeks, which I think is good. 

For breakfast I have protein brown sugar oatmeal with a sliced banana mixed in. I mix a coffee pod with the chocolate powdered breakfast essential mix.

Don’t really eat lunch. I’ll have baby carrots with Greek yogurt ranch, or an apple, or baby cucumbers, that sort of thing if I’m hungry. 

Dinner I mostly enjoy eating the same thing every day, so it’s usually a cup of cauliflower rice, 4-6 oz of baked chicken breast, and 1 c of vegetable, like broccoli or Brussels sprouts, just seasoned, no added oils. I typically add a low calorie teriyaki sauce or something of the sort.

Or I’ll make a spaghetti squash and eat a cup or cup and a half of that. Last night I made a quesadilla with carb control tortilla, reduced fat cheese, 3 oz baked chicken, and I can’t believe it’s not butter lite.

For sweet treats I bought these dove raspberry sorbet mini bars that I have only sometimes. 

I very precisely count my calories and log them into the app MyNetDiary.

I do the treadmill at Planet Fitness for an hour at 3-3.5 mph four times a week. Too shy to do anything else for now lol.

I get about 9 hours of sleep a night, I drink probably 60 ounces of water a day.
