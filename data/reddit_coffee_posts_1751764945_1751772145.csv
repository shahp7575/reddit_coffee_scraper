I was wondering if I should get the xm6 or the AirPods Max based solely on ANC efficiency. I don't really care about the price right now since the AirPods are on sale and are the same price as the xm6. For context, I need to block voice sounds like in a busy coffee shop for example. I also heard some people recommending using earplugs with anc headphones to block the most sound as possible. Will that interfere with the xm6 in ear ANC mic? Also, I wear glasses.

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in what many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to have met people to exchange with, and I'd like to see if I can find that again.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn't matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I'd like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange, in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. That being said, I'm increasingly interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be more open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so let's start with what works best for us.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan). Thoroughly introverted, with a deep desire to engage with those who can tap into that aspect of me. My personality is designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation. I'm potentially interested in many things with the right people and in the right environments, but left to my own devices, I always come back to the same core things.

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* Cognitive vibes are key for me. I do best with abstract minds that peak with ideation and whimsy, but don't think I'm so limited. Compatibility is a strange thing that feels most real when it's too fluid to be defined. We're compilations of potential that spark and enhance through engagement.

*Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine.* I'm an autodidact who's been passionate about a variety of pursuits since I've been young. I'm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, but also that a lack or limitation is highly limiting. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I write; about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

*I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee.* I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted.",1,1751771858.0,penpalsover40,0,1.0,False
1lsrdbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1lsrdbc/review_of_catalonia_riviera_maya_vs_catalonia/,Review of Catalonia Riviera Maya vs. Catalonia Playa Maroma,"I just got back from four nights at Catalonia Riviera Maya and wanted to share a review specifically comparing it to Catalonia Playa Maroma, where I usually go. I am a budget(ish) traveler and go to AIs to be left alone to read in a nice setting, to not have to worry that my needs will be met, and to enjoy the luxury of not having to make decisions. 

So here are the comparisons I think I can safely make:

Location
Do not ignore or smooth over reviews of CRM that state that there is no beach. You‚Äôll see pictures of a beach. There is no beach. I repeat: THERE IS NO BEACH. If you want to be on a beach, do not come to this resort. They have a little inlet/bay that is man-made. It is presently choked with sargassum as I presume all beaches are in Cancun right now and they are doing their best, but there is no beach. Of note, I took shared transport to the resort and some folks got out at a much more upscale resort than mine and the smell upon opening the van door was gag-inducing. Don‚Äôt assume the high end resorts can do anything special about the sargassum. The reason I didn‚Äôt bother to switch resorts on my first day to CPM is because the sargassum is everywhere and I would not have been able to enjoy the beach there had I transferred. 

Resort Grounds
Layout felt more resort-like than CPM, sort of reminded me of a Club Med from the 90‚Äôs. Very well manicured. Constant upkeep. A lot out in the sun. The wildlife was different - lots of agoutis and no coatis that I saw, which might be preferable for some guests who are unnerved by those smart little badger-cat-raccoon creatures. Agoutis are like cat-sized capybaras and are cute as hell. Also saw big iguanas here, and the grackles are bold. 

This resort is the same as Catalonia Yucat√°n Beach (CYB). Same grounds, no real delineation, you can walk among both. If you‚Äôre price comparing and wondering about amenities, they are the same between CRM and CYB. Just pick the one you get the better deal on.

I noticed that there were ramps everywhere I saw stairs, even if they were tucked around a corner. At least one building has elevators serving higher rooms. Paths are smooth and wide and well maintained. If you use a mobility assistive device you‚Äôll probably get around well at this resort. This is in contrast with CPM which was definitely not optimized for anyone on wheels. 

Food
Bless everybody‚Äôs hearts, but the food here is appalling. I thought the food offerings at CPM were mediocre, but at least they had a large buffet and the food options were diverse with plentiful fruit and fish/seafood options. There are two buffets here at CRM and they are both a quarter of the size of CPM‚Äôs buffet, and empty at every meal which tells me people are leaving to eat elsewhere and/or going to the speciality restaurants for dinner. But I have simple tastes and a small appetite, and figured I would try and make it work. 

Some more details if it is helpful:
One of their buffets - the one closer to CYB - is indoors. The other one is essentially outdoors and it hot and uncomfortable; I did not trust the things that were supposed to be cold. Of course the indoor one is not open for lunch at the hottest part of the day. One area where CRM was better than CPM: non-alcoholic beverage options. Actual aguas frescas were available at the buffet at every meal, serve yourself. The desserts are the same as CPM: everything gelatinized, lots of puddings. The breads are the same as CPM. 

I ate at Ayami, the Teppanyaki place, for dinner one night. If you are used to a Teppanyaki experience‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt go here. My chef was brand new, which the waiter told us, and at the end of the meal, he apologized. Literally apologized for the experience. Sigh. It wasn‚Äôt so bad that it merited an apology, but it was the most sullen and unenthusiastic Teppanyaki chef I have ever had. I hope she‚Äôs ok, like with her life. All meats and veg cooked on the grill were bland/unseasoned and overcooked. The sushi appetizer was bizarre (banana on top?) and the fish quantity so small that I understood that fish was just not on the menu in any meaningful way at this resort. 

From other vacationers, I was warned away from the other restaurants. Considering Ayami is widely considered the best, I took this advice. 

There is a snack bar in the daytime in the place where the steak restaurant is at night. They serve lunch food. Beach hot dogs (note: specifically labeled non-pork for those who need this!) and fries, tacos, ‚Äúpizza,‚Äù small salad bar. Since the lunch buffet proved inedible for my first two days, I ate here the second two and it was not exactly good or what I was hoping for on my vacation but at least I wasn‚Äôt hungry. There is a crepe stand on the CYB side, not as good as CPM‚Äôs crepe spot. No fresh fruit for the crepes other than bananas; toppings were thin fruit syrups. Also there are no milkshakes there - the sign is out of date. The food truck is a little square box serving grilled cheeses. Didn‚Äôt look appetizing to me but lots of kids were lined up and munching happily. No coffeeshop like CPM, which I patronized daily for iced coffee and better pastries. 

Accommodations
I arrived and was told my Premium Single room wasn‚Äôt available, so they were upgrading me to a Premium Suite. Sounded good! I got one of these upgrades once when I went to CPM and it was a dream. Here it was a nightmare. The room was literally located next to reception, the arrivals driveway with huge buses idling, the evening bar, and the theater. I couldn‚Äôt use my balcony because it was not private, I couldn‚Äôt even open my curtains because every person checking in could look straight into my room. My first evening when I should have been relaxing, my room was literally shaking from Karaoke next door, and I could hear every vehicle idling. I went to reception and requested a room change‚Ä¶ I could have literally raised my voice and asked from my balcony but I did walk over. The front desk initially balked at my request, but eventually agreed to move me the next day, which meant checking out at 11am the next morning and back in at 3pm for the new room. 

The new room was in the 4000 block and it was so much better. More private, more quiet. Less renovated? Sure. Smaller? Also yes. It was honestly kind of shabby. But I was happier there for the rest of my trip, and able to enjoy reading on my balcony without feeling like I was in a fishbowl. 

A note to those wishing to upgrade their lodging even beyond the premium suite fishbowl: I walked past the very premium and ultra premium accommodations. They are laid out like little townhouses along one edge of the property. They were not private at all, and along a strip where tons of drunk people stumble back to their rooms at all hours; the balconies overlook the main path. Maybe they‚Äôre nice inside, but they are not going to offer the luxury of peace and quiet. Be forewarned. 

Spa
I was pleasantly surprised by the spa, given the rest of the resort. This was an objectively nice spa. I had the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù treatment which was two hours and cost $230 USD. For what I got, it was very worth it - a one hour massage, 45 minute facial, and 15 minute scrub.  My therapist was Ana and I would recommend her. The atmosphere is peaceful, temperature controlled, and felt luxurious. I have not gone to the spa at CPM, so can‚Äôt compare. 

Guests
Being careful here and sticking to the facts as I observed them: the clientele at this resort was different than CPM. The majority of guests were British, and their behavior shocked me. So, so many drunk Brits, in a constant state of being overserved. I witnessed more bad guest behavior here than at CPM by a mile: truly falling-down drunks, screaming, picking fights with one another, vomiting in bushes, abusive behavior towards staff. I‚Äôm sure there were other folks drinking a bit too much in the sun, but one can literally hear the language and accent in which they‚Äôre speaking/screaming. 

I saw plenty of security but they walked right by these folks, which tells me this behavior is tolerated at this resort. 

Families with children were mostly non English speaking. 

Entertainment
I don‚Äôt partake of the entertainment at resorts, but I definitely walked by a very enthusiastic daytime pool show that was Mexico-Canada friendship themed and the evening shows are in an indoor temperature controlled theater rather than the outdoor amphitheater at CPM. There was a live cover band one night at the bar and while it‚Äôs kind of funny to hear a singer singing hits phonetically in English, the musicians were legit and had some talent.

Excursions
I don‚Äôt partake of the excursions, but the desks to schedule excursions were easy to find around the corner from reception, and unobtrusive. There was a vacation club outpost by the pool staffed with their concierges, if that‚Äôs your thing. 

Overall
I won‚Äôt be back. This resort was notably worse than Catalonia Playa Maroma in almost every way. ",1,1751771854.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

If you‚Äôve seen my posts here is an update: I (23M) finally went on that coffee date with the woman (38F) I met at a networking event a little over a month ago! We met up today, and I greeted her with a hug and asked how she was doing. The conversation started off a little slow, but it gradually became more relaxed and natural. We ended up chatting for about an hour and a half. She seemed engaged, maintained good eye contact, played with her hair a bit, and stayed present throughout the conversation.

It didn‚Äôt feel like a mentorship vibe like some thought it may be, she didn‚Äôt ask about my career or give advice. I asked questions, and she seemed happy to talk and share

I picked up the tab at the end, and she thanked me without hesitation and didn‚Äôt insist on paying herself. When we left the coffee shop, I offered to walk her home, but she declined, saying she lived nearby and it would be the opposite direction of the subway for me. I offered again just in case, but backed off when she insisted. We hugged goodbye, and that was it.

Now to be honest I‚Äôm not sure how to read the date. She didn‚Äôt really flirt, and we didn‚Äôt make plans to meet again. I‚Äôm planning to text her tomorrow to say I had a great time and to suggest doing something together next weekend but don‚Äôt know how to phrase it. 

Because of the age gap, I‚Äôm only looking for something casual and not a serious relationship. If things progress, I plan to be upfront about that. My question is, based on how the date went, does it sound like she‚Äôs interested? And does anyone have ideas for a second casual but fun outing that won‚Äôt send mixed signals?

Also, I‚Äôd really appreciate advice on what exactly to text her tomorrow‚Äîespecially since I want to suggest hanging out again without coming on too strong.

Additional context: The reason we hadn‚Äôt met sooner is that she was traveling internationally for work for three weeks. Before she left, I told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôd really like to get to know her better‚Äù and invited her for coffee. She actually offered to meet the next day, but I wasn‚Äôt available. While she was away, we messaged every few days and she shared updates about her trip.

For three years, I was forced to s3rve men day and night. Countless men left my room with their pants still undone. I wasn't even allowed underw3ar, losting all control over my own body. The smell of shame clung to me. 
When my brother finally came to get me, my legs had been brutally broken. They probably expected tears and pleading. But now I was pale, hollow and sick. I knelt numbly and my voice shook as I begged, ""I'm sorry I was wrong... I'll never dare again... Please...""
My brother looked completely panicked. He rippied off his shirt and draped it over me, screaming hysterically, ""Who did this to you?! I'll kill them! I'll slaughter their whole damn family!""
With a faint smile, I weakly raised a trembling hand... and pointed straight at him.
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
1.Chapter 1 Three Years' Punishment
""I'm warning you one last time‚Äîkeep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""
""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.
Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.
She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.
Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.
What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers‚ÄîMichael Osborne. The famed war god himself.
He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.
This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times‚Äîhim finally coming to take her home.
Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.
Because it was him‚Äîhe was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""
The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.
""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me‚Äîdo you finally admit you were wrong?
""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment‚Äîshe'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""
When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""
The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""
But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember‚Äîhe was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.
Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.
When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.
She had thought, 'My fianc√© can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement‚Äîrisking his life, even, to spare me from harm.
'And my parents in the duke's estate‚Äîsurely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'
But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment‚Äîmerciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.
She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.
Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women‚Äîtools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.
They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.
But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.
Eventually, she stopped fighting back‚Äînot out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.
""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.
He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'
The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone‚Äînow it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.
He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'
Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""
But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No‚Ä¶ please don't‚Ä¶ don't touch me‚Ä¶""
""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""
His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""
Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.
In front of Michael‚Äîor her parents‚Äîshe had never once had the right to feel wronged.
If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.
Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth‚Äîshe'd been swapped at birth.
The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.
She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.
Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.
Whenever Willow Monson‚Äîthe girl who'd lived her life‚Äîfelt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.
Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.
They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""
Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.
Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.
But Willow ended up poisoned‚Äîvomiting blood.
Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.
Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away‚Äîbanished from Pidence City forever.
Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""
No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.
The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.
In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.
But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp‚Äîbelieving that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.
A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.
Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""
Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.
Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back‚Ä¶ then drag yourself back into that camp.""
2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?
Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.
Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.
Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim‚Äîputting on a show to win his sympathy.
If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.
What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena‚Äîlet alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.
Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage‚ÄîI don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""
Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.
Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.
But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""
""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.
Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties‚Äîfor good. Just‚Ä¶ not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.
Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter‚Äîso thin and pale, her eyes distant‚Äîand her expression faltered.
Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.
No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter‚Äîstill her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.
""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.
But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.
Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good‚Äîfor your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""
Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me‚Ä¶""
Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.
Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.
Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.
""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant‚Äîgive her a little time, all right?""
The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.
She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family‚Äîwe should love each other, just like before.""
Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.
Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'
""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.
That was when someone finally lost patience.
""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""
Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.
""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!
""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""
Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier‚ÄîEloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.
Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'
Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""
""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.
""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained‚Äîshe's done everything she could to protect this family.""
Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.
""Athena! Willow even covered for you‚Äîshe told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.
When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""
Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.
Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.
He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her‚Äîand for a while, he meant it.
When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.
But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.
Love that could be so easily withdrawn‚Äîthat kind of love, she no longer wanted.
The air between them turned stiff with silence.
Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside‚Äîyour father and grandmother are still waiting.""
Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.
After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""
""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing‚Äîbut somehow, it said everything.
Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.
She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it‚ÄîMichael, her parents, her brothers.
But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.
3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes
Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""
Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great‚Äîshe's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""
Athena nodded quietly.
Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family‚Äîbut she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.
Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.
She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now‚Äîof marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.
""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""
Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.
But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.
She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.
""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""
The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.
As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house‚Äîwhile Willow was merely adopted.
The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""
The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.
Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""
Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.
One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed‚Äîclearly selected for looks and cleverness.
""I'm Siena Hotham.""
""I'm Aliza Crofton.""
Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""
Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.
Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""
Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.
The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now‚Äîlooking after their husbands and raising children.""
Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.
The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.
The table was already set. The meal was generous‚Äîfour dishes and a soup‚Äîbut the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.
She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.
Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""
Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""
Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""
Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten‚Äîthis wasn't the military camp anymore.
This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.
The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat‚Äîit was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.
Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.
Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners‚Äîshe looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.
Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.
After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.
""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.
Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.
Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly‚Ä¶""
Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them‚Äîcalm, expressionless.
There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.
Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.
Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.
Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises‚Äîsome new, others long faded.
If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.
After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine‚Äîsoft, warm, and tailored to fit.
But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.
""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.
Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.
In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.
She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.
""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""
Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow‚Äîagain.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.
When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.
She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.
He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""
The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty‚Äîfor her.
At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'
But now‚Ä¶ it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.
She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.
Eloise looked toward the door‚Äîand frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'
4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame
Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.
""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""
""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.
He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""
Athena almost laughed out loud.
She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear‚Äîwhat I came back in from the military camp?""
That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""‚Äînot ""Mother.""
Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.
A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.
His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years‚Ä¶ how did she waste away like this?'
Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""
Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.
Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.
""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""
That warmth, that longing in her eyes‚ÄîAthena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.
""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl‚Ä¶ you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless‚Ä¶ I couldn't protect you‚Ä¶""
Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.
The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened‚Ä¶
She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""
Just one word‚Äîand Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.
Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.
Athena had been home for some time now‚Ä¶ and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""
She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.
Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.
Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.
She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'
But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.
Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""
Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars‚Äîblackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.
Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor‚Ä¶ how did she end up like this?""
Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries‚Äîhow did they happen?""
Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course‚Ä¶""
Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""
She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.
But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten‚Äîfor three full years. How has she even survived?'
Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fianc√©'s command‚Äîhow could anyone there lay a finger on you?""
Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""
Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""
Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""
She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""
Nicolas stared at her in silence.
She was smiling, yes‚Äîbut it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.
His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak‚Äîwhen Willow's voice suddenly broke in.
""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak‚Äîif I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine‚ÄîAthena never would've been punished.
""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents‚Ä¶""
She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.
Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""
Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is‚Äîwhat are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""
Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""
Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow‚Äîoffering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.
And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.
But of course‚Ä¶ she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.
5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There
Just then, the Duke of Suffield‚ÄîHenry Monson‚Äîwalked into the room.
His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""
Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""
After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""
Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""
That one phrase froze the air in the room.
Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""
A hint of anger crept into his expression.
Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""
Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.
""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.
He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'‚Äîwhat, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""
Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""
Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.
Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""
She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.
Margaret tried to fight for her‚Äîbut her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.
Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.
She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'
Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face‚Äîbut before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.
Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.
The room fell dead silent.
Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""
Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it‚Äîshe's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this‚Ä¶""
Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt‚Ä¶ I didn't even think. I just moved.""
When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.
Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.
Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen‚Äîyet no one paid her any attention.
She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.
When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.
But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.
Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.
Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.
He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""
Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look‚Äîbut when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.
""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.
""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.
Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.
She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""
Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.
""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.
Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""
After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.
She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""
Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.
Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""
Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.
Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician‚Äîit's the best.
""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly‚Äîit'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""
She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just‚Ä¶ don't take it out on anyone else.
""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""
She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it‚Äîand saw right away that it was half empty.
She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.
Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.
Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.
Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.
Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.
'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'
""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.
Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""
She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.
Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.
She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness‚Ä¶ I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'
6.Chapter 6 Replace Her
The next day, Athena was summoned to Margaret's courtyard.
When she arrived, Willow was already there, kneeling obediently beside Margaret, gently massaging her legs.
The moment Athena walked in, Willow scrambled to her feet in a panic. She greeted her timidly, ""Athena,"" then quickly stepped aside to give up her spot, looking every bit the picture of meekness and quiet suffering.
Nicolas frowned, clearly displeased. His voice was low and stern. ""Willow, you're also raised under this roof. You don't need to act so pitiful in front of her.""
Then he shot Athena a sharp look, his eyes full of disdain. ""No one in this house owes you anything. Who are you putting on that sour face for every day?""
Eloise gave a light cough into her handkerchief. ""Nicolas, that's enough.""
Nicolas glanced at her, then held his tongue‚Äîbut his expression remained cold, and his eyes, harsh.
Athena understood then‚Äîhe was speaking up for Eloise. He must have heard that she'd turned Eloise away the night before.
She looked over at Eloise, who wore a stiff, embarrassed expression.
Eloise seemed to want to say something, but when her eyes met Athena's icy gaze, she lost her nerve and backed off. Annoyed, she turned and snapped at Nicolas, ""Go check if your grandmother's medicine is ready.""
He knew perfectly well she was trying to send him away‚Äîand truthfully, he had no desire to face Athena's cold stare any longer. With a flick of his sleeve, he stormed out.
""Such a temper,"" Margaret muttered once he was gone, then beckoned to Athena. ""Athena, come here. Sit with Grandmother.""
Athena came forward and sat beside her. Margaret took her hand, her voice warm and affectionate. ""You've had a hard time.""
Athena placed her hand gently over hers. ""As long as I have you, Grandmother, it hasn't been so hard.""
Margaret let out a long sigh, then got to the point. ""Athena, there's something I want to ask you.""
""Of course, Grandmother. Please speak.""
""Do you still care for Michael? Is he really the only one for you?"" There was hesitation in her eyes, and a deep, pained concern in her expression.
Ever since Athena returned to the estate, the Osborne family had sent someone‚Äîvery discreetly‚Äîto suggest replacing her in the engagement.
Not wanting Athena to be humiliated, Margaret had sent them away under a pretense.
Athena understood immediately. ""They want to call off the engagement?""
She had spent three long years locked away in a military camp‚Äîher reputation utterly ruined. Of course the Osborne family would no longer want a disgraced woman as a daughter-in-law.
Margaret nodded, clearly struggling to say it aloud. ""It's not quite breaking it off‚Ä¶ They just want to marry someone else instead.""
Athena's eyes shifted to Willow, who quickly looked away, guilt written all over her face as she lowered her head.
It all made sense now.
Her reputation was in tatters. If the Osborne family officially broke the engagement, it would offend the Monson family and create bad blood.
But they didn't want her anymore. Swapping her for Willow‚Äîpure, innocent Willow‚Äîwould be the perfect compromise. And more importantly, Willow was willing.
Everyone in the room was focused on protecting the duke's estate's reputation‚Äîyet not one of them had asked Athena what she wanted.
No wonder their expressions had all been so tense. They were afraid she'd cause a scene. Too bad for them‚Äîshe wouldn't give them that satisfaction.
""Grandmother, I agree,"" Athena said, her face blank, her tone as calm as if she were commenting on the weather. ""I agree to the change in engagement.""
Margaret and Eloise stared at her, stunned.
""But you were once so in love with Michael. What made you change so suddenly?"" Margaret asked, clearly baffled.
Athena had once cared for Michael so deeply she would've laid down her life for him. That was the only reason Margaret had bothered to ask her in the first place.
But Athena's expression didn't waver. ""That was a long time ago, Grandmother. People change. I stopped caring about him ages ago.""
At that, Eloise let out a visible sigh of relief. She turned to Willow and gave her a knowing, tender smile.
Willow clung to her arm, eyes lowered, face tinged with shy delight.
The quiet exchange between the two made the whole situation feel even more absurd to Athena. The decision had clearly already been made‚Äîso she wondered, 'Why the charade of asking me?'
Margaret looked at Athena with deep sorrow in her eyes. ""Athena, don't be afraid. Even if the Osborne family backs out, I'll do everything I can to find you a good match.""
But she knew in her heart‚ÄîMichael had been the best they could hope for.
With Athena's name in tatters, there was no way they could arrange a match of equal status now. No noble family would consider her. Her life, as far as society was concerned, was over.
Margaret felt a stab of grief‚Äîher precious Athena had endured too much.
But Athena just smiled faintly, as if it no longer mattered. ""All I want is to stay by your side, Grandmother.""
""Don't be silly."" Margaret sighed. ""You can't spend your whole life looking after me.""
She hated to see Athena wronged, but this was the best outcome left. If the Osborne family officially ended the engagement, Athena's reputation would be in complete ruin.
Before long, Margaret grew tired. After helping her settle in for a nap, Athena quietly stepped outside.
As she walked out, she handed a folded slip of paper to Marquita Huynh. ""From now on, prepare Grandmother's medicine using this prescription.""
Marquita looked surprised. ""Lady Athena, where did this come from?""
""A friend gave it to me. If you're unsure, feel free to have a doctor look it over."" Athena didn't elaborate. She handed over the prescription and walked away.
Just as she stepped through the gate, she stopped abruptly‚ÄîMichael was standing right in front",1,1751771468.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1lsr73v,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1lsr73v/could_this_be_adhd_or_something_else_just_want/,Could this be ADHD or something else? Just want the truth.,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm not looking for a diagnosis here ‚Äî I know that can only come from a professional ‚Äî but I‚Äôm hoping for some clarity and maybe advice from people who‚Äôve been through this.

Growing up, I was always told I was just a ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù kid. I‚Äôve always been very impulsive, very blunt, very emotional, and socially a little ‚Äúweird.‚Äù I‚Äôd get angry quickly, cry easily, and feel overwhelmed. I‚Äôve always had a hard time regulating my emotions ‚Äî and it still happens now.

But I never really thought about ADHD, because I could pay attention in class (at least on the surface), and my mom never pressured me about grades. She didn‚Äôt care if I got a D or an A ‚Äî she just wanted me to pass and enjoy being a kid. So nobody really noticed anything was ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù

There‚Äôs also something about my school history that might matter:
When I was in Grade 1, I was already 9 years old because I had a terminal illness before that and couldn‚Äôt start school on time. On top of that, I wasn‚Äôt really ‚Äúsmart‚Äù enough to pass the first grade at the usual age. Because of my older age, I got away with a lot ‚Äî teachers didn‚Äôt really push me, and classmates didn‚Äôt notice much either. Eventually I took an exam to accelerate me into the ‚Äúright‚Äù grade for my age, and that‚Äôs when I really started struggling.

By then, I realized I had no real study habits. I‚Äôd never learned to take notes properly or study from books. In fact, through all of high school I barely ever opened a book ‚Äî I just listened in class, wrote things in my own words, and managed to scrape by.

Now I wonder: maybe I was just undisciplined. Maybe I was just lazy or stupid. Maybe I got away with too much early on, and now I‚Äôm paying for it. Or maybe there‚Äôs an underlying problem ‚Äî ADHD, anxiety, something ‚Äî that explains why I feel so stuck.

Here are the things I still struggle with:
‚Äî Forgetting things constantly and misplacing stuff.
‚Äî Making silly mistakes, even in math, which I actually love and am good at conceptually.
‚Äî Hyper-focusing on things I find interesting but shutting down on boring tasks.
‚Äî Terrible working memory ‚Äî I forget steps, signs, instructions easily.
‚Äî Feeling ‚Äúuseless‚Äù without a calculator even though I understand the concepts.
‚Äî Sensitivity to noise, textures, and crowds ‚Äî I get irritated fast.
‚Äî Horrible handwriting, bad spelling, emotions all over the place.
‚Äî I feel ashamed a lot because I do try ‚Äî but I still fail in areas where I don‚Äôt feel interested.

And here‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs related:
Whenever I drink coffee, it‚Äôs a hit or miss ‚Äî sometimes it makes me anxious and jittery, and other times it just makes me sleepy. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a sign of anything or not, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

What I really want is closure. I want to know if this is really just me being lazy or undisciplined, or if there‚Äôs something deeper ‚Äî ADHD, anxiety, whatever ‚Äî going on. My mom and sister have even said they think I might have ADHD, but I‚Äôve always brushed it off because I didn‚Äôt think I fit the stereotype.

I guess my question is:
Does this sound familiar to anyone?
Does it seem worth it to get evaluated?
And if it is ADHD (or something else), is it even possible to improve and feel more in control?

Thanks for reading all of this. I just want the truth so I can stop beating myself up and start working on the real problem, whatever it is.",1,1751771259.0,mentalhealth,3,1.0,False

If you get a lite ice rebel, it will not be filled up to the top completely unless you want to buy another rebel can. No ice means you want the same amount of liquid that is in a normal drink filled completely with ice. Since we fill the cup full of ice, this averages out to be about half. Cold pour, which will be extra in costs, is zero ice and filled completely to the top. The price depends on size and the drink you are getting.

I‚Äôll be in Toronto from¬†**July 6 to 20**, working remotely weekdays¬†**11:30 AM to 7:30 PM**‚Äîbut my evenings (and weekends) are wide open. I‚Äôm hoping to meet people who are curious about actually doing things in the city, even if it‚Äôs just a relaxed coffee in a park to start.

A bit about me:

I‚Äôve been living in¬†**Victoria**¬†for 3 years now. Before that,¬†**10 years in the Philippines**¬†and¬†**17 in Saudi.**

So far,¬†my **2025**¬†has been about:

* learning how to sail (spent 5 days aboard in the West Coast Gulf Islands),
* getting better with motorcycles (I had a highside fall - front flipped and rolled. Don't worry I already passed my MST weeks ago)
* climbing (scars on my arms)
* laughing with friends while playing poker, big2, or mahjong. And deepening my bonds with them.
* playing the piano
* learning French (hoping to get my A1 level this year; want to be part of my Duolingo fam membership?)
* watching films, playing video games (hey Clair Obscur or TeamFight Tactics fans)
* running and hitting the gym.

I'm for moments that start small but stick around. Friends say I might be an¬†**ENFJ**, but I think I‚Äôm still figuring out the letters.

I‚Äôve got a few ideas lined up for the time I'm here

* Checking out¬†**climbing gyms**¬†(Rock Oasis, Joe Rockhead‚Äôs)
* **Off-road moto tours**¬†(Off Road With Us Toronto)
* TIFF Lightbox films like¬†*Life of Chuck*¬†‚Äì I‚Äôm staying super close to this place
* Short runs, long bike rides, quiet parks
* Romeo & Juliet¬†at the High Park Amphitheatre (July 13)
* Summer blockbusters (*HTTYD*,¬†*Materialists*,¬†*Mission Impossible*, etc.)
* Chill evenings with a drink or two, maybe good jazz or a rooftop bar

But honestly‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt need a grand plan. Just someone to share the city with‚Äîhowever that shapes up. So if any part of this makes you pause (in a good way), reach out. Let‚Äôs meet, talk, wander, climb, or sit in stillness for a bit.

I discovered mold in my DeLonghi Dinamica espresso machine (automatic bean-to-cup), and I‚Äôve been deep-cleaning it for over an hour now. Unfortunately, I keep finding more gunk and I can‚Äôt fully take it apart.

Would you just replace the machine or try to get it professionally cleaned?

Personally, I‚Äôm leaning toward replacing it. I don‚Äôt mess with mold. It gives me the ick and this feels like a health hazard at this point. (To be clear, this is my fault. I went on vacation and forgot to empty the basket. RIP.)

So:

ü´ò Looking for a new automatic espresso machine (not pod-based, I want to use my own beans)

ü´ò I‚Äôd love something that grinds and brews with minimal daily effort

ü´ò Not trying to drop $6k, but I‚Äôm okay investing in something decent that‚Äôll last 3 to 5 years like my last one

ü´ò Not into Nespresso (but if you‚Äôre a diehard and want to convert me, fine, I‚Äôll listen)

Mainly need it to be an espresso machine, would prefer automatic. 

If you‚Äôve bought a machine you love or know where to shop for one locally (Seattle WA), please send recs. I‚Äôve heard of Seattle Coffee Gear, anyone been?

1lsr2yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALS/comments/1lsr2yi/should_i_tell_my_dad_he_is_being_taken_advantage/,Should I tell my dad he is being taken advantage of?,"
My dad was diagnosed with ALS last year, and he immediately started searching for anything that might help. Recently, he found out about a place called Body Science in Miami, FL. Since then, he has sold his home and his truck to pay for their treatment. He says it‚Äôs worth it because they claim a 70% success rate in reversing ALS. I supported his decision. This is his journey, and I can‚Äôt imagine what he‚Äôs going through. It sounded like a chance at hope with impressive claims.

I visited him yesterday, and he told me about his second 3-week visit to Miami. I asked if he was seeing any positive results, and he said he has actually gotten worse. He can no longer breathe on his own when lying down. With this disease, just as you begin to come to terms with one devastating reality, another hits right after. My dad is still walking by himself and gets up early in the morning on his own to make coffee that is prepped for him the night before. 

After hearing more about what Body Science is doing, it all sounds like fake medicine. I‚Äôm not a doctor, but it feels like snake oil. They‚Äôre doing things like injecting him with some dye RFK Jr. talks about, running his blood through UV light, claiming to ‚Äúopen toxin pathways‚Äù due to supposedly sky-high heavy metal levels, and treating him for Lyme disease. It seems like they say the same things to every patient. At first, I thought it might be experimental drug therapy, but it‚Äôs mostly just supplements and pseudoscience. Now they‚Äôre blaming him for not improving because he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúavoiding toxins‚Äù well enough.

These treatments are three weeks at a time. I can‚Äôt help but feel that this time would be better spent with family. We all help care for him, and I‚Äôm about to spend a week as his primary caregiver so we will have a lot of time together to talk. I feel so conflicted. I want to tell him how I really feel, that these people are taking advantage of his desperation, and that he should be spending this time with loved ones. But I also don‚Äôt want to take away his hope if hope is fueling him, just something to take his mind off of it all? And part of me wonders, what‚Äôs the point now? The time is gone. The damage is done. My new reality is that any day my dad could fall when no one is watching and I could lose him.

because we haven't been meeting our efficiency quota, a lot of hours have been cut, so we don't have enough hands on deck to deal with everything: balling dough and packaging frostings & glazes & misc things, mixing things from the game plan and as we need them, decorating cakes and cookies, panning out cookies to be baked, and someone fulfilling orders. usually there's only one person fulfilling orders, and another employee occasionally stepping in to help out.

i think one of the worst parts about working here is the ridiculous 2-minute time limit rule. there were three employees at my location today, including me. there had to be one guy balling the molten lava cookie at all times so that we wouldn't have to wait for it to freeze again and the closers wouldn't have to stay longer, the other guy mixing, decorating, and panning, and then me who is stuck at the order station for minutes on end dealing with the rush. something that especially annoys me is when customers who ordered online or doordashers say that they're here when they're not actually, so you just wasted time doing an order to meet the time limit when you could've been doing an order for someone who was actually there. it's especially bad when there's multiple six packs and four packs of big cookies that need to be dressed. i usually manage to get everything out before the time limit, but even then, it's stressful. i feel bad for the guy who had to make up for the morning shift's shortcomings to support me, too.

another thing i hate is that all of the customers are staring at you while they wait for their cookies. there's no room to express any sort of frustration like there might be at a different food service job because you are being scrutinized. not to mention the pressure to make every cookie perfect, customers who don't even thank you, don't tip during a rush, and ones who expect you to tend to their every need when there's obviously multiple people waiting on their order. and god forbid you don't say ""for deez nuts"" or ""for benson goon"" to some middle or high schooler who thinks you're an npc.

the open concept doesn't make crumbl more welcoming, it makes it more awkward. they can all see you when you are at your most stressed and i hate it. even coffee shops, where most of the employees are somewhat visible but still hidden by a counter, get more privacy than us.

i think if someone from corporate actually worked at a busy crumbl location for once that they would realize how abysmal the 2-minute time limit is when you're short-staffed, and that the open concept is generally unpleasant. maybe my store in particular is stressful because the management sucks and most of the employees started around the same time because of the high turnover rate, but does anyone else feel this way?",5,1751770318.0,crumblcrew,0,1.0,False

The place was just 15 mins walk from my apartment but guess what you arrived ahead of me. I forgot my glasses and didnt notice that you were seated right across the room not until you called my name. 


We were wearing a matching black long sleeves paired with jeans and when you smiled you made my heart literally jump 10 feet off my chest and for some weird reason it felt like 1st date all over again. We ordered hefty food you paid all of it reason being kasi sabi mo ""para may next time"". That's my queue that you really like my company. And what made the night even more interesting when you asked me ""is it okay if I will bring you home?"" Girl, humaba ung hair nagloop sa QC circle coz 1st time someone asked me that question I wanted to hear. Hindi imposed ung paghahatid, but rather may respectkais may consent. Too bad we didnt had pictures that night. 


We had few more dates and some special night. The first time I saw you I know I really want you, not just as a friend but more than that. How we clicked and laugh. Or how our values are aligned and the importance of family in our lives. And I can imagine waking up with you making your breakfast and coffee. At times that we will be working from home, I will do the cooking and you will do the dishes and we'll have those long drives on weekends. 


But some things are not meant to be, as much as I do like you I know I wasnt ready to take what we have a notch higher. Things started to crumble one day and I tried to hold it off but it fell flat on thd ground. I was hurt but i know I hurt you more unknowingly. But of the flipside i am still thankful that we are still friends to date  and seeing your picture beside her part of me was saying it should've been me but I blew my chances. I saved our pics and what I love the most is when you were hugging from the back and we were both smiling. Kapag nakita nila un the usual comment ""grabe bagay na bagay kayo"". 


So maybe some stories are meant to be that way, the happy ending means we gained a friend but lost the possible love of our life. Sakit di ba? And i know I aint alone with this dilemma. Ikaw rin ba nabiktima? Pero naniniwala ako na di man sya ung tao na laan sa akin meron pa rin darating, kung kelan di ko alam?

I only started to get into preworkouts because of the opportunity to use stimulants to get that boost (high caffeine, all the other stuff). 

Yes, there is some psychological boost in these stimulants but it can be hit or miss, depending on the day the same stimulant can cause you to wander off into some imagination land in the middle of a workout or on the flip side it could give you some kind of superman motivation to get the job done. 

But BARE KNUCLE by APOLLON is the first preworkout I‚Äôve ever used that actually gave me so much energy in the form of strength (if it makes sense). I just kept going and going and I could‚Äôve  worked out for hours and hours. 

Next time I try it I‚Äôll aim to defeat my PRs and let you know how it goes. But in terms of endurance I had so much energy that the volume of the weights lifted should = more gains alone. 

Damn, I didn‚Äôt know a preworkout could do that. I got distracted by the allure of stimulants, that ‚Äúhigh‚Äù. But I find it now to be kind of overrated. 

I think a black coffee brewed to perfection + a non stimulant workout like this is probably what preworkouts were originally designed for and i only just stumbled upon this. 

Oh yeah and the PUMPS, now I understand why people talk about the pumps.

Our apartment building has a weirdly active social life, people in our building get together for pizza parties and coffee socials and L--- had her 80th birthday today and I was going to go down and say hi.. and I just couldn't do it. I felt weird about it. It would be the first time I'd seen most of them since my transition. And these are a bunch of old people that I barely know. Its not like my cousins or some old coworkers that know me.  These are like.. normies, boomers that I've chitchatted with about fishing and yard sales. 

What's weird is a few of them have seen me around the building in girl mode and haven't recognized me. Either they didn't recognize me or didn't say anything. perhaps I am the topic of building gossip. I have no idea.

This is why i was nervous. My parents, i know them. they love me, they accept me unconditionally.  I'm lucky to have them.  These building neighbors are a wild card.  Maybe one of them is a huge transphobe! Maybe they all are. I have no idea. they never had any trouble with my husband and I as a gay couple, so they'd probably be okay with us as a ""het"" couple... maybe!??!  It was that uncertainty that gave me pause. and the fact that I didn't want to blow in and take over this poor woman's birthday party with my own coming-out scene. 

The fact is that I don't really mind at the end of the day what my neighbors think of me, BUT they are in a unique position to make my life difficult if they really do decide i'm a sicko or whatever.  So I kept away when I kind of wanted to go say hello. Maybe I'll just go knock on L's door one day and tell her directly.

I can't drive (partially because of the anxiety but also because of a disability in my hand that makes gripping the wheel for more than a few minutes painful) so I never have the chance to go anywhere. I‚Äôm 29 and I have never grocery shopped alone, gone to the gym alone, nothing. The closest I have ever been to really being alone is when my mother would drop my off at work and then pick me up after (which felt identical to when I was at school).

I work from home editing now so I leave the house even less than I used to but I've decided I really need to try to leave the house more often. My therapist even mentioned maybe finding ways to work outside the house. So, I‚Äôm shit scared, but I'm gonna do it. Tomorrow, I‚Äôm gonna spend time alone. In public. 

I bought a messenger bag for my computer and my mother is going to drop me off at a coffee shop about 15 minutes from home and I will be there for a few hours working. I‚Äôm terrified. I keep telling myself it's a good thing. That I'll get a coffee, a sweet treat, plug in my headphones and be all set. That everything will be okay and anyone who is in there will be concerned with themselves and not with me. But then my brain starts firing off. 

""What if someone steals my computer? What if someone steals my bag? What if people stare at me? What if I get hurt? What if that is the time someone decides to rob the store? What if I run into someone I have bad history with and there is no one there to cover for me? What if family I‚Äôve cut out of my life comes in? What if I get super sick while I'm there and have to go to the bathroom? Do I take the computer with me or risk it getting taken? What if I spill coffee on my computer?"" 

And on and on and on. 

I‚Äôm gonna be 30 in the fall. I want to be more independent, I want to be more confident and do more things on my own so I can eventually feel comfortable enough to be independent. How do I get over this deep anxiety of being alone in public? Not just at the coffee shop but at the gym, at the store, anywhere.

For instance, one month I might have to go super fine for a good pull, while others require something coarser. Does anyone else use subscriptions like this where you get to try multiple different varieties of beans, and do you feel it's worth the hassle of having to dial in the grind every time a new round comes through?",1,1751769353.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Since we were fry, I occasionally met his then GF, now his ex and became friends with her too. We used to chill together a lot. And I was good friends with both of them like if the guy was out of town, me and his ex would make plans to go out etc. I always thought they would end up together and was so happy for them. I met them when their relationship had turned 5 year.

A couple of years later the guy had to move out of town and I guess long distance did not work out. The guy started doubting her if she is cheating on him with a colleague (which she did not) and they ended up breaking up on the phone. I usually give them as much space as possible but this time things were getting ugly. Me being close to both of them brought them to a place together to talk as my last try to make this work but both ended up putting their points to me rather than talk with each other and ended up breaking up after 7 years of relationship.

A few months post this COVID hit and I went back home to stay with my parents and support them. The guy still kept in touch with me but the girl slowly drifted away. They eventually ended marrying other people a few years later. Note: I am only touch with the guy, so I am also an acquaintance to his now wife and daughter. 

I had visited the guy‚Äôs place last week and we planned to catch up for drinks. While drinking, he opened up to me saying him and his ex have now been talking for 6 months and they have been texting intimate stuff with each other. He also told me that they are planning to meet. At first I thought it‚Äôs okay coz meeting his ex is fine you know over a coffee or something. But then he told me they are going away for a weekend.

Now I am not sure what to do. I tried telling him it‚Äôs wrong but he isn‚Äôt backing off. Should I confront his wife and tell him this or should I completely stay away from all of this. But my heart aches coz it‚Äôs unfair to his wife and daughter.",3,1751769050.0,Marriage,4,0.8,False

1lsqega,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1lsqega/why_cant_i_hate_my_ex_and_move_on/,Why can‚Äôt I hate my ex and move on,"Hi guys,
I (19) just broke up with my gf (also 19) 3 days ago and i just need help understanding why i‚Äôm more sad and miss her more than anything. We‚Äôd been going out for 2.5 years, and except one incident, (she had a brief emotional affair with another girl (she bi) but her parents had just broken up and she was at a very messy and troubled part of her life so we worked through it and that was 2 years ago and nothing like that had happened again), it was pretty amazing, even talking about getting engaged in a couple of years, we really felt like we were made for each other, until the last couple weeks. We said our final goodbyes today.

I‚Äôm from the UK but have been working in Canada for the last couple months, while my gf was at Uni. Before coming out, i had seen her every 3-4 weeks and we were doing good. I was due to finish here in 2 weeks and she was going to join me for those and we were going to go travelling. For the last few weeks of June, the amount we chatted dropped, due to her being busy with end of year exams and i was moving around quite a lot, but i didn‚Äôt think much of it because she was just about to come out and we both knew we were busy. that was a mistake. she flew out on the 2nd, and started off the 2 weeks i had planned a lot and was really looking forward to by telling me she had fallen out of love, and didn‚Äôt think it was right to be together anymore. she said she wanted to see if these 2 weeks reignited the spark, but wasn‚Äôt sure they would. i was pretty devastated but was understanding because i loved her and wanted to respect her decision, despite being surprised and a tad annoyed that she hadn‚Äôt said anything earlier (she said it had been building for a couple weeks). 

that would‚Äôve been okay if that was it, but it wasn‚Äôt. a few weeks ago, she told me one of her friends was flirting with her quite a lot. i told her to tell him she wasn‚Äôt interested and had a bf, and told her to let me know if he kept messaging her. the day before she flew i asked if he had messaged her anymore, and she said he hadn‚Äôt and all was good. the first night she was there, after telling me all the stuff above, i notice him in her recent messages, and when she was showing me picture of the end of her term, i noticed he appeared quite frequently. i didn‚Äôt say anything straight away letting it brew in my head. i have some trust issues from a previous relationship so i probably shouldn‚Äôt have done this but too late now. that night, while she was asleep, i got so anxious that i had to check her phone, hoping to be able to calm my nerves. big mistake (or not, she wasn‚Äôt going to tell me i don‚Äôt think). at their end of year ball (3 days before she flew out to see me) they got drunk and kissed, but not only that, the messages they sent, both before and after that. we‚Äôre very flirty and really not a great read to be honest. i felt so many negative emotions i couldn‚Äôt sit there by myself, so i woke her up and told her what i saw and told her i was officially ending things, and was going to cut the trip short and get home. 

the next flight she could get was 3 days later (today), and i decided that i wanted to see a final check thing before i headed home, but couldn‚Äôt get there till today as well, and that meant we had to share the airbnb for those days together, sleeping in the same bed (it wasn‚Äôt a full house, just a room, and i looked to rent out somewhere else but because there‚Äôs a huge city event on right now, the prices are insane and there was no chance i could afford them). those days were so confusing for us, i really really wanted to just hate her and not talk to her but it was clear we both still cared about each other despite what happened, and we ended up talking a fair bit those days, a bit like we used to, we even got coffee and i hate to admit it but we kissed at night. she begged me to take her back, but that was the one part i was able to stand my ground on, i knew what happened would make me never be able to trust her fully again, and combined with the thing from my previous relationship, it would‚Äôve been terrible for my mental health. it felt so wrong afterwards, but it all felt comforting in the moment and it was hard to avoid because of the situation. anyway, so we both said goodbye this morning, and it‚Äôs really starting to set in that we‚Äôre not together anymore - we had texted everyday for over 1000 days straight and told each other all the highlights, and now i can‚Äôt do that. the place i‚Äôve gone wasn‚Äôt part of our original plans, but i took the bus through a town which we were meant to stay in, and i saw a shop which i thought she would love, and realised that there was no point thinking that as she wouldn‚Äôt be with, and that also hit me quite hard. things like this keep cropping up in my mind

since i found out, i knew what i had to do and never once had any second thoughts, i knew i was never seeing her again after we left. her begging was so hard to see, but it didn‚Äôt change my mind

but why can‚Äôt i hate her

i absolutely hate what she did, especially because it happened so close to our holiday, but as much as i try to i just can‚Äôt hate her, i still deeply care about her despite what she did

it‚Äôs making it hard to move my mind away, i miss her

how to i overcome this

to be clear, i don‚Äôt want to hate her necessarily, but i‚Äôm asking more how do i move on when i feel like this despite what‚Äôs happened

i would also love to hear any other advice about moving on and healing from this

Im partially writing this to vent, but also to just put out a disclaimer. 

For context, and a little bit about myself... im a transwoman that lived in Vancouver, and recently moved back to my hometown of Surrey, I identify with she/her pronouns. Im also bisexual, and to add onto all of this ive been transitioning since 22, and am now 32. So for about a decade ive been on this journey of self discovery, acceptance, and just all around love. For laymen terms, (for the record I hate this phrase, its very loaded) I pass well, even on the days where im tomboyish. Im at a point where I consider my transition ""complete"". 

Anyways, over the past few years ive seen a clear increase in violence against Queer folk, not just Trans folk, but literally everyone apart of the community. To be honest, I feel so much safer in Surrey compared to Vancouver... and thats wild.(literally grew up hearing gunshots lol).

 This morning I was called every slur in the book, and was threatened with physical violence by a grown man simply for just existing, and buying a coffee. My coworker has a black eye because he was called a homophobic slur. A few months ago a group of guys accosted me, threatening my safety because I passed them on the side walk. These are just some basic examples as of most recent. Every single time this has happened in a crowded space, im left to fend for myself. Ive tried calling authorities but whats the point? I'd likely get beaten to a pulp before they'd get there. Quite frankly id rather have both my hands ready just incase. 

I guess im kinda just getting to my wits end, and wanted to put this out somewhere relevant so other queer folks can see this. 

Let's all just treat each other with love regardless of race, gender, and sexual orientation.

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. Let's feel each other out to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan). Thoroughly introverted, with a deep desire to engage with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I'm designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adoptee of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone. I'm potentially interested in many things with the right people and in the right environments, but left to my own devices, I always come back to the same core things.

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* Cognitive vibes are key for me. I do best with abstract minds that peak with ideation and whimsy, but don't think I'm so limited. Compatibility is a strange thing that feels most real when it's too fluid to be defined. We're compilations of potential that spark and enhance through engagement.

*Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine.* I'm an autodidact who's been passionate about a variety of pursuits since I've been young. I'm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, but also that a lack or limitation is highly limiting. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I write; about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

*I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee.* I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted.

While very quickly, they are roaming a new life, sharing publicly all that is awesome. Though not to be confused with masking the reality, they‚Äôre overheard while talking to the kids, and in a private setting when not on display for all to see, they are going here, doing that, enjoying this or that?

The kids are always curious. Where are you, what are you doing? And it‚Äôs overheard, meeting this new friend, group, activity, social event, dinner, breakfast, coffee, it doesn‚Äôt end.

I‚Äôm barely able to function, my life continues to fall apart, the more I learn about how I was abused, how it changed me, the psychological damage caused by them and how this is likely to impact me in the future. I‚Äôm in therapy, I‚Äôm trying to get out, I‚Äôm trying to do life, I‚Äôm struggling to breathe.

Hearing their voice pains me. I put in earbuds as often as I can, listening to music. I know their voice, I know when they‚Äôre truly happy, and I hear it. They‚Äôre happy and living her best life.

Historically, I could never share effectively how I was hurting. Everything was my fault, and any attempt to share my feelings or emotions were shut down and I was attacked in the process.

As they were leaving, I begged to be heard and it was turned against me, this was my own doing, they said.

Since leaving, I wish only to share what I‚Äôve learned, to let them know just how much their actions unknowingly damaged me while we were together and now, 100x it seems.

They want no part of it. They owe me nothing, I fundamentally understand this. They left and it‚Äôs over, there is no saving things, no restoring, and no confusion on my part that is if they could only understand, they would return or make amends.

Their only position is that they are the victim, they got out, they had to save their life, and protect our children. There is zero accountability or responsibility and it feels every bit of someone wanting to be a part time parent, so they can enjoy half the time, the life they want without children. Concern for the children, was cited, yet countless verbal, written, and legal support for 50/50 custody. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me.

I‚Äôm trying to do everything I read, and I put to action recommendations. Despite this, I cannot seem to move forward in accepting that they think something of me that is not true. They will not considering hearing that which is true. They‚Äôre intentionally or unintentionally making it known that it was the best decision of their life, and not one, not a sole in their circle of family or friends truly understanding or is even aware of the issues that plague this person for which destroyed me from the inside out.

We went to a ""makeup trial"" that turned out to be with the bride's friend who is a Mary Kay consultant. She did our makeup, passed out order forms and announced she'd give us a few minutes to make out our orders while she got some cake and coffee.

She DID do a beautiful job, but I felt ambushed and this was manipulative to do to us. 

Purchasing all the products this consultant used on me would have cost almost six hundred dollars. None of the bridesmaids bought anything. You could tell she and the bride were pissed. 

I don't think this type of ""party"" is appropriate and we should've been told what it really was in advance. How hard is it to say, ""Hey, my friend does Mary Kay and has offered us a demo!"" ??? 

The bride and her friend evidently counted on us ordering enough products to make it worth her friend's time in sales and new customers. Nothing more was said afterward about her doing our makeup for the actual wedding!

I moderated wedding boards on a major industry site for almost ten years. (I love to talk weddings!). Their forums didn't allow vendor posts but MLM Consultants think this means Everybody But Me! 

We got BOMBARDED by posts from MLMs like Pampered Chef, Cutco, Tupperware and a RABID sex toy biz called Passions that wouldn't stop raving about their fantastic ""registry"", awesome ""bridal showers"" and especially their ""Bachelorette Parties""!

""Give the bride a wedding night to remember!""

Just what every bride wants.....a bridal shower for her mom, bridesmaids, neighbors, grandmother and Great-Aunt Ida to purchase lubes, vibrators and sex toys for her wedding night!

Pampered Chef was probably the next worst. I removed around 20 of those every day!

I admit to bias. I believe the MLM business model is predatory, deceptive and unethical. My parents had an horrific experience with Amway that deeply damaged our entire family, especially us kids.

Anyway, how much would you love a sex toy shower?

How about I tell you all the good things that have manifested in my life since quitting vaping?!

First things first: I can breathe. I can take a deep, delicious, healthy breath of fresh air and have a sigh of relief afterward.

I get to enjoy life. I‚Äôm not constantly thinking about when I will vape or planning how to do it discreetly. Seriously though, I‚Äôm present in every moment. I used to be at the coffee shop with friends and I‚Äôd be tapping my foot, anxiously waiting to go outside and hit my vape. I‚Äôd even look at my phone and think *just wait 5 minutes* and then I‚Äôd tell my friend I‚Äôm gonna step outside. How utterly sad it was that I couldn‚Äôt have a lovely one hour coffee date with a friend without running outside to vape two or three times??

No more health scares or scary medical symptoms. Obviously I could have already done some damage to my body. I‚Äôve made peace with that idea. If I find out my lungs are super messed up from vaping, that‚Äôs okay. But as I type this, I have no more chest pains, no discomfort at night while trying to sleep, a lot less phlegm to spit up AND no blood in said phlegm! 

Money!!! I was spending literally $300 a month on vapes. No, I‚Äôm not exaggerating. I was also relapsing while trying to quit by using the patches. So at one point I was buying vapes AND nicotine patches (please don‚Äôt be annoying about the patches. They worked for me and I‚Äôm so happy they exist!!! Cold turkey wasn‚Äôt for me and it just isn‚Äôt for everyone. Respect everyone‚Äôs quit) Now that I am vape free AND off the patches, I feel rich!!

Image. Ok this is weird but now that I‚Äôm vape free (yes only 20 days rn but last stint was 40 so I‚Äôm doing good I think), I think about my image as a non-vaper and I just feel cool. I feel like a cool, hip, healthy thirty year old that doesn‚Äôt drink or vape. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone when I say *people look silly vaping*. Truly.

If I think of anything else I‚Äôll add it in the comments!! If you‚Äôve quit too and you want to add something, please do :)",5,1751767663.0,QuitVaping,5,0.86,False

I know there was a post here a few days ago about where the late 20s early 30s folk are hanging out, it looks like nothing's come of it yet. I'm desperate for community though, so I'm putting myself out there in search of some new girl friends.

I'm 28F, work remotely from home, I like to do pottery, work out, go to concerts/fests (Lollapalooza anyone?) and doomscroll. Here's some of my favorite activities we could do together:

1. Do our makeup together and complain about past, future, or current situationships

2. Get coffee/matcha and talk about the state of the world and whether or not you should text your ex

3. Wonder why the mandarin line is so long and then lengthen it

4. Dance and laugh at the club 54 DJ who keeps asking where the latinas are

5. Complain about the heat and our fleeting youth all day and plan a beach day about it


If any of this interests you at all, please hit my line (and by that I mean send me a DM so we can exchange Instagrams). Together with our iron fists we will eradicate the loneliness epidemic üëä kapow!!

We booked 2 rooms (room 1: 1 adult, 16 year old and 14 year old; room 2: 1 adult and a 9 year old) we will be heading to Alaska from Seattle on July 27th! So here are my questions:

1. Is the Princess plus package really worth it? Especially with how we have our rooms set up? My husband will probably be needing some wi-fi access at some point though. Kids love drinking lemonades and water. As for my husband and I, he‚Äôll probably do a glass or 2 of wine and lots of coffee and I‚Äôll probably do maybe 1 alcoholic beverage a day, at the most and water. We are also planning to get off at the ports and enjoy the excursions out there. 

2. Is it best to book the excursions through Princess or viator? 

3. What do we really get included in the standard package? (Ex. Can we get water? Coffee?) 

4. In regards to the gratuity fee, is that a charge that is per room or person? And that is also automatically included in any and all food and beverage purchases, right? 

5. If the kids are in any of the kids/teens clubs, can they order drinks there? Are there any free drinks, or can they take stuff with them? 

I don‚Äôt know what else to ask, but if you have any suggestions as to what else I need to look into or sign up for, for myself and my family, please feel free to share.. thank you for your time üôè",2,1751767329.0,PrincessCruises,2,1.0,False

I can‚Äôt stop being angry at her - Help??,"We were long-distance for most of our 1-year relationship. Things started off great (Facetiming every night, couldn‚Äôt keep her hands off me when we are together, etc), but once she went back to school and I moved away for work, she stopped trying. I was always the one reaching out, and she‚Äôd leave me on read because she‚Äôd get distracted by her friends, or she was ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù. What‚Äôs most hurtful is that she‚Äôd hang out with the same friend group every day at the same time, but couldn‚Äôt make time for me. Later in our relationship she even admitted she would receive a text from me and think, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time to deal with that right now.‚Äù

Even when I would come up and visit her at school, she seemed to act like a completely different person around me compared to her friends. She seemed more excited and genuine around them, but with me, she was more quiet. Her friends always were the first to know what was going on in her life, but I would always find out a month later. I had expressed to her that I wished she would keep me more updated in her life, or just open up a little more around me. Then she‚Äôd get offended and say sorry and change nothing. 

(Disclaimer: I always knew she was quiet from the time we started dating. It was just off-putting and a little hurtful to see such a different side she was putting out for her friends and not me). 

During our anniversary weekend in April, she was cold and distant ‚Äî no affection, barely spoke, didn‚Äôt even open the card I got her. She just watched TikTok, and gave me the whole silent treatment in my own home. I planned a whole special ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù day for us. I even picked her up coffee and made breakfast. But she acted like she didn‚Äôt care. Turns out, she had planned to break up with me that weekend but changed her mind. 

Apparently, she wanted to dump me because: 
1.) she didn‚Äôt like the way I interacted with her family, I was always so shy and neither her or her family liked that.
2.) she wanted someone she could touch all the time, so I guess long distance wasn‚Äôt working for her intimacy wise.

Looking back it‚Äôs bullshit

But Suddenly, she also wanted to fix our communication, even though it felt like I was having to beg her to talk to me. 

And here‚Äôs the kicker: A month before she almost dumped me, I expressed that I wanted to talk to her a little bit everyday on the phone. Really even 5-10 minutes would be fine.
We were barely texting, if anything sending a snap a day. I felt like we were growing apart everyday, and it didn‚Äôt even feel like she was my girlfriend when we were apart, felt more like a friend. But she said ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ I think 1-2  times a week would be enough.‚Äù 

I even remember when she did FaceTime me for about 15 minutes and‚Ä¶ it was so awkward. I have always felt like a burden to other people, and her unwillingness to communicate with me didn‚Äôt help.

Anyways, after our anniversary weekend, She said she wanted to fix things, and for a few weeks we did ‚Äî daily calls, I visited again, things felt okay. I even visited her at school and she kept telling me she loved me, and even initiated intimacy. However, there were some signs that maybe she wasn‚Äôt as motivated as I was. After we agreed to give the relationship a restart, She met with me and a friend at a restaurant and it was just awkward. At one point I brushed her leg and she side-eyed me and asked ‚ÄúAre you touching me..?‚Äù 

Like sorry, god forbid I accidentally touch my partner. Even my friend expressed later that it had made her uncomfortable seeing that.
But something felt off again when I went to her family home for Easter. She would barely talk to me, and was almost avoiding me. The last words she told me were that she loved me, and then I drove back home.

Then she ghosted me again that week. A few days later she FaceTimed me and broke up with me for real. She was smiling and laughing, she could have been nervous, but it still hurts. 

Her reasons? We didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe same morals,‚Äù I was too career-focused, and she just wants to be a band director. I thought that was odd, because once she graduates next year, she will also have to start her career.
She also said we had become different people and she wasn‚Äôt attracted to me, but it feels like she just strung me along.

Now she‚Äôs off having a great summer with her friends, posting about how they‚Äôve helped her ‚Äúthrough the breakup,‚Äù while I‚Äôm left with the mess. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a terrible person, but the way she treated me was cold, avoidant, and unfair. I‚Äôm trying to move on ‚Äî but it still stings. I am really just having trouble not being angry. It‚Äôs been months, and I don‚Äôt want to spend my entire summer being angry. It also doesn‚Äôt help that we have mutual friends.

Any tips? 


TL;DR: My long-distance girlfriend neglected me for months, acted cold during our anniversary, then dumped me over FaceTime after ghosting me again. She blamed distance, ‚Äúmorals,‚Äù and wanted out. I‚Äôm left hurt and trying to move forward but I can‚Äôt stop being angry and seeing her happy doesn‚Äôt help. ",1,1751766865.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

This is going to be super long, so stay with me.

I, 19M have been with my girlfriend 19F who will call Carmen for almost 4 years now. I will be using fake names for everyone for privacy reasons.

My family consists my dad (40M), my oldest sisters Kate (22F) and Helen (24F), my mom (41F), my younger sisters Judy (4F) and Lucy (5F), and my twin sister Rachel (19F). My mom and my dad have been divorced since I was 12 and Judy as well as Lucy are my half sisters. Judy is on my dad‚Äôs side and Lucy is on my mom‚Äôs.

It all dates back to almost 4 months ago. I was helping my dad fix my car when Carmen called me hysterical, I asked her to calm down and try to explain to me. Between sobs, she told me her father had just been deported. Now, Carmen‚Äôs family is Hispanic while mine is white. I have a big family while she‚Äôs the baby of the family and has two older brothers. This news was very unexpected as her father is a well known and kind man. Never hurt a fly. He taught me how to cook their cultural foods, how to fish, stories of his home, and even gave me his blessing incase I wanted to ever marry Carmen in the future. I‚Äôve known this man since I was 14 and I was upset myself to hear the news.

Her brothers, Lucas (25M) and Marco (23M) are very far from her and were the first to get the news. Their dad called Lucas and broke the news as their dad works in many different places for his job. Lucas told Marco who told Carmen. Carmen was home and she realized she wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to afford the rent or any bills her dad was paying. Lucas and Marco were moved out with their own things. Lucas was three states away with his wife and two kids and another on the way and Marco was in college in a whole other country.

Carmen, having no where to go called me. For extra background, Carmen has always been hardworking, and working at her job since 16. But even with her pay she wouldn‚Äôt afford the home her dad was paying off and the bills. I immediately told my dad the situation and he said she was more than welcome to stay with us.

I got her to relax and said we‚Äôd be at her place to help her pack as much as she could. After we did arrive, she was a mess. As we helped her pack, she took breaks to just cry and sobbed the entire time having to pack her dad‚Äôs things up. We put all the other things that weren‚Äôt technically hers into a storage room we used for our own stuff. After she got everything she needed, we got back to my house and helped her unpack and she was staying in my room.

I told Carmen to take a nap and calm down and we‚Äôd talk about everything when she was awake and stable. My dad and I sat my sisters down and explained it to them. Kate and Helen were very sad for her and willing to help her, but Rachel was very hesitant. She said Carmen was a grown woman and was able to go find apartments and her own storage. My dad got angry at her and said that she was still a young woman and just got her life torn and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. That shut Rachel up but little did I know it would bring more trouble.

My dad ended up calling my mom and explaining it to her and she understood. My family loves Carmen, since we first started dating as 14 year olds they loved her. Carmen is so kind, very beautiful, hardworking and knows how to be respectful and loving. She loves babysitting my sisters and hanging out with my older sisters. She helped my dad with some tools since her dad worked with them and even learned things from my mom since Carmen‚Äôs own mom was very absent in her life.

After Carmen woke up, she began to explain in tears she‚Äôd manage her job, pay any rent or bills, buy food and offered to cook and clean. Even offering to take extra shifts at her job because she doesn‚Äôt like to be in a home and be sluggish or not helping. I told her she had to calm down to which my dad, being the man of the home told her he wouldn‚Äôt charge her anything and she could be in her routine she always had. The only thing my dad asked is once I‚Äôm ready to move out, she‚Äôd have to as he‚Äôs heard us talking about moving in together. And to just remember her manners and all. Carmen was relieved but still had her guard up.

The first month living with Carmen was amazing. Even if we told her she didn‚Äôt have to, she would cook and clean the home and would take extra shifts here and there. She managed laundry and watched over Judy. She even fixed the shower drain when it clogged and the sink when the tap was leaking. Carmen was amazing around the house and we even got to spend more time together and learn how to accommodate each other staying in the same room and getting intake for the future when we moved in together. Until month 2, when my sister Rachel comes into the picture.

Rachel has been my best friend before birth, my built in one. Being twins was amazing since we had our own inside jokes and our adventures. Until 5th grade, when she began to just be mean and shut everyone out which followed into her teen years. Rachel got into the wrong friend groups and did drugs and some vaping. As much as my family put their foot down, tried to be extremely nice, and even give silent treatment Rachel never budged and got worse.

But by 8th grade she was Carmen‚Äôs friend before I even met her. She would mention Carmen around me but I always thought it was another of her dumb friends until I had a class with her and it‚Äôs been history since. Rachel and Carmen were best friends even but now since everything has happened Rachel has gotten sour with Carmen.

Rachel lives with my mom and has a strained relationship with my dad but when she comes to see Judy and me, Carmen tries to make small talk but Rachel either ignores her or gives backhanded comments. Sometimes she even just asks Carmen bluntly when she‚Äôll move out. I‚Äôve gotten into arguments with Rachel telling her she can‚Äôt talk to my girlfriend like that but Rachel ignores me or gets defensive telling me family comes first and I shouldn‚Äôt be trying to turn against her.

Month 3 is when everything came crashing down. It should‚Äôve been the first warning to avoid the big event. My dad, Kate, Helen, Judy, me, Rachel and Carmen were having dinner discussing how we‚Äôd spend Lucy‚Äôs birthday since she invited us all. Carmen was excited and had discussed with my mom on making the cake, Carmen is an amazing baker and never fails to make me full in the best way possible. Carmen showed her ideas since Lucy‚Äôs birthday theme was a Shark and aquatic theme. That‚Äôs when Rachel scoffed loudly and said ‚ÄúNo one really cares if you‚Äôre baking a cake, genuinely just stop talking you‚Äôre giving me a headache.‚Äù The room went silent and Carmen had tears in her eyes but apologized and just remained quiet or only speaking when spoken too. After the dinner, I got mad and yelled at Rachel telling her she couldn‚Äôt say that and I understood if she had a headache, but all of our family was talking and she didn‚Äôt complain then. Rachel got defensive and told me I was selfish for choosing Carmen over her and we were twins, saying we stick together.

My dad told me Rachel was just being moody and to let it go and maybe she established a boundary that came out to harsh to Carmen. I told him he didn‚Äôt understand and that Rachel can‚Äôt be mean to her.

I comforted Carmen and told her it was gonna be okay. Carmen understood Rachel‚Äôs side but I was hesitant and thought she was probably just trying to understand to not seem like the victim. Carmen is very sympathetic and so kind hearted but she hates being center of attention and hates getting people in trouble. She‚Äôs too kind but also very emotional. I told her it‚Äôs okay to cry because it was mean.

Now the big thing comes in. Being very foolish, Carmen got pregnant. We used protection but it did fail, she cried and told me she was willing to consider an abortion but I said we could handle this and I was already looking into apartments that both our salary‚Äôs could cover. I was actually a little excited to be a dad but also asked her input. Carmen‚Äôs always wanted to be a mother, she is very good with kids and loves kids. She only would go with what was best for me and her and would never want to ‚Äúbaby trap‚Äù me. But I said we‚Äôd manage and get through this together for the sake of our child.


We told my family and they were all happy for us. My sisters and mom gave her advice and offered to help her during the pregnancy, my mom kinda scolded me for being foolish. But other than that, she was excited to be a grandma. Helen made a joke she was surprised out of everyone I‚Äôd be the first to have a kid. 

After a while, Carmen was on the couch getting advice from my mom, my dad, and their partners on how to care for kids, what to expect, and how to be prepared. Everyone was happy, but Rachel.

As my family was helping with dinner, talking, and making sure Lucy and Judy were in their sight, from what I heard later on from Carmen, Rachel had cornered her at the upstairs hallways and was telling her she babytrapped me and she was gonna regret it.

Rachel‚Äôs always had weird humor and jokes and ways of saying it, so Carmen thought maybe she was overly sarcastic. As Carmen when downstairs Rachel shoved her almost making her trip on the last step but she was okay just startled.

Rachel blew up at Carmen and screamed at her, raising her voice by the minute. She accused Carmen of being a baby trapping bitch, telling her she wasn‚Äôt good enough for me, she even accused her of cheating on me and maybe the baby wasn‚Äôt even mine. Everyone began to get involved trying to calm the situation but Rachel began to scream ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why your dad was taken! You‚Äôre nothing but a sl*tty b*tch! You‚Äôre so lazy and you live with us rent free. I hope that mistake d*es!!‚Äù And a lot more horrible things. 

The room was silent and it seems everything stopped around us. Carmen began to sob and ran off to my room. My mom began to lose control and scream at Rachel, telling her she had no room to speak. Rachel had no job, didn‚Äôt pay anything, and just begged my mom for money to go to the movies with her girlfriend. Kate and Helen were backing mom up and saying she was harsh and completely in the wrong, and Carmen was never a baby trapper. My dad was a very big gentle giant, so his tone was scarily calm, telling Rachel to get her stuff and just go home. Get her girlfriend to pick her up and leave.

Rachel yelled at everyone saying they‚Äôre all turning against her, that we were under some sort of spell and Carmen was blinding us all. She looked at me and gave me the same ramble she always did. Calling me a traitor before i asked her to leave.

After she left, everyone was still mad or tense with the situation and I went to Carmen. Carmen was in our room crying and telling me she was gonna get rid of the baby. I told her not to, that I knew she didn‚Äôt want to and neither did I. She agreed she didn‚Äôt want to but she didn‚Äôt wanna trap me. I told her she wasn‚Äôt trapping me and I was so excited to be a dad. After a long talk, I got her to calm down and take a nap to not be stressed.

Now, Rachel told our extended family, mutual friends, and even my ex girlfriend, Victoria (19F) that Carmen was baby trapping me, it was obvious, that Carmen was cheating and my family turned on her. Now I‚Äôm getting texts from family and friends, some asking the truth as they knew Rachel‚Äôs scheme, and some called me cold, sent threats hoping something happened to my kid, and some saying I could‚Äôve not betrayed my twin. 

Victoria reached out through social media, telling me she was always here for me and I could talk to her. Saying we could meet up for coffee and even get revenge on Carmen. Background on Victoria: Me and her dated when we‚Äôre 13, only for 4 months but we were close friends before it. Like best friends. And she hated Carmen when she began to date me. Telling everyone I was cheating on her with Carmen, Carmen was a wh*re, and she hoped we didn‚Äôt last and kept stalking me and wanting to reach out. At some point, she befriended Carmen and manipulated my poor girlfriend into believing she was a nice person. Trying to get information on me from her, keeping in touch with her, wanting to get any chance for her to ‚Äúslip up‚Äù and be mean to her. Victoria would be mean to her and dry but Carmen would excuse it as maybe depression or whatever. I told Carmen Victoria was a manipulator and wasn‚Äôt good news but Carmen was hesitant. I blocked Victoria and told anyone who believed Rachel the true story.

Some family and friends who believed her did switch sides and apologized, others still think I was mean or I‚Äôm lying. I‚Äôm now in the process of putting a payment on our apartment and trying to move out faster to avoid Rachel. My dad supports my decision and offered to help move stuff to not stress Carmen and to help with payments.

Carmen tries to reach out to Rachel to apologize and talk, but Rachel screenshots it and posts it on her story saying it‚Äôs manipulation and calls her a snake. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. Rachel is my twin sister but she has gone too far, and even in the first month, I‚Äôm trying to care for Carmen as her pregnancy progresses. Advice will be the biggest help. What do I do? Do I continue comforting my girlfriend and moving or do I just focus on the fact my sister is saying these things? This is Rachel, and I feel like she‚Äôs planning something or wanting some ‚Äúpayback‚Äù on me and Carmen. This is stressful and intense.


[SMALL UPDATE]

Hey everyone, even though there‚Äôs only a few comments, thank you for the support. I thought I was genuinely going crazy over not taking my sisters side. Some people have said it‚Äôs very long and I apologize, I do ramble a lot and like to add full detail incase I don‚Äôt make it clear.

I posted this on another thing 4 days ago, but I would like to make it clear, Carmen‚Äôs pregnancy happened in the beginning of June and as of now, Carmen is a month pregnant. We‚Äôre very happy and excited for it. We went to the first ultrasound and cried. She is doing great stress free and already craving weird things I‚Äôve run out to get at the store lol.

Rachel has not tried to contact me since the argument. Carmen stopped trying saddened she couldn‚Äôt get anything from my sister. I‚Äôm still angry at her and want to go full no contact. My parents being my parents say maybe to reconsider as she‚Äôs my twin, my sisters take my side and said they are done with Rachel.

Carmen says to give her a chance, bless her heart. She says see where it takes me and hopefully Rachel will come around. For now, I‚Äôm thinking about it and might consider for the sake of my girlfriend.

I will probably not be updating for a while as I‚Äôm working my way to a promotion, moving to an apartment soon, focusing on my girlfriends pregnancy and finding rings to propose soon as I know she‚Äôs the one with these past 4-5 months showing it through hard ships and all. Thank you again, I‚Äôll try to reply to anyone I can but for now, take care and I‚Äôll update when I can. Thank you.",4,1751766736.0,AITAH,21,0.7,False

Thanks for being great!,"I live in Cheyenne, Wyoming. I moved here last year from Massachusetts (don't ask) and had an opportunity last year in June to visit Custer and Mount Rushmore (it was a foggy day) for a day. Custer is a great little town that had a nice coffee shop. I stopped at their local YMCA and had a nice talk with the staff about the state and Massachusetts. Shoutout to employee Rex! He gave me some life advice.

Anyway, yesterday, I had the day off so I decided to drive only 4 hours from Cheyenne to the Black Hills area. It took a little longer than  I wanted it to, and I crossed the South Dakota state line around 4ish. I stopped at the Farmhouse in Spearfish and had a BLT. The fries were very crispy and the BLT itself was, indeed, great!

I then drove to Deadwood and arrive at approximately 5:15ish. It was a red brick road with a lot of tourists but it was a nice looking little town. I found some free parking and walked along the strip. I stopped in one of the local ice cream joints and bought a chocolate shake. Nice counter people. I chatted with the lady about South Dakota and tourists. She mentioned that she likes it when it's busy, and is originally from California. I then went into some local shirt shop and bought myself a Deadwood t-shirt because why not? The only shirts I wear are all black and I thought I should add some variety to it.

And you know what? The freaking Sandlot was playing in Deadwood on the plaza! You better believe I sat down and watched the entire thing with the rest of the, either, locals or tourists. Everyone was quiet, well behaved, and was glued to the movie. People laughed most at Squints kissing Wendy as the lifeguard. It was a damned good time!

I, sometimes, vlog my adventures with my cell phone. I have NOT put any of my vlogging stuff on the internet yet, although, maybe one day. When I took out my phone and started talking, a couple of women threw themselves behind me and wanted to get in the video. They wanted to ""get in my snap"" meaning they thought I was snap chatting, but I don't have snapchat and wasn't doing that. They were like ""oh, dang. Sorry."" Funny little interaction.

  
I then drove to Lead (Led? Or lead like feed is pronounced?) and parked the car and decided to view the fireworks. I walked around that town and noticed that a lot of the locals were friendly people. At least 3-4 people said hi to me, a couple strangers made small talk with me, one group asking me if I know the area (I did not) and as I was walking along the town, a random guy said hello to me, to which I said hello back, and we started chatting about Massachusetts, South Dakota traffic, and other various things that make the country unique. I didn't catch his name, but he owns the lasagna joint in Lead. Nice guy. Shoutout to you if you're reading this!

There's a coffee joint in Lead called Lotus that looks like a great place to get a cup. I, however, did not get one even though I am a coffee drinker. 

I'm not a 4th of July guy or really a Holiday guy in general. I thought the fireworks in Lead were very sub-par and underwhelming because I heard they were great. It was mediocre. But it's all good! I had fun in South Dakota again!

Sturgis, Rapid City, Pierre, and other various small towns are on my list to see. when I have more time. And I can't wait to see North Dakota as well!

Thanks for the great time, South Dakota! I've been to your state twice and have had fun each time and always enjoy chatting with y'all. You all seem friendly and mellow. And I hear that your state gets no traffic!

I just wanted to write about my brief time there. Cheers!",7,1751766658.0,SouthDakota,1,0.77,False
1lsptjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1lsptjc/just_quit_as_kitchen_manager/,Just quit as kitchen manager!,"I just quit my job of 1.5 yrs! I was the kitchen manager of a coffee shop/brunch spot. In the time that I was in this role, I was given no ability to do what was in my job description. Couldn‚Äôt order food, couldn‚Äôt create an inventory tracker since the owner claimed they were working on one (still doesn‚Äôt have one after MONTHS), they asked for a new menu and after testing and creating one on my own dime they never implemented it, and so many more issues.

After securing another job, I put in my notice, and instead they ended my employment a week early. So instead, I ended it today!! Leaving tomorrow‚Äôs Sunday brunch to‚Ä¶have some difficulties. I at least warned my staff before sending a message in the work chat that blew UP!

Here‚Äôs what I said:

‚ÄúHey guys. I put my notice in earlier this week, and my last day was supposed to be next Thursday. Instead, I have been excluded from next week‚Äôs schedule. This means of the staff at <work>  are being punished with 6-day weeks and shorter shifts (no break meals!)

I apologize that it is being taken out on you all.

I quit, not because of one simple reason, but because of many big problems within this company.

The lack of communication from our bosses about events, promotions, finding out about promotions through social media before even being told.

Receiving our schedules not even 3 days ahead of time often times, leaving us to scramble any plans we need to make outside of work.

The empty promises. Promises of change, stability, and yet, here we are. Overwhelmed, understaffed, and unprepared.

The inability to do the jobs we were hired to do. As kitchen manager, I was supposed to do food orders, create an inventory tracker, new processes to streamline the kitchen. Yet, our bosses couldn‚Äôt hand responsibility over, wasting potential.

Employees are scared to complain, as they will be berated, pulled into a meeting with the person they‚Äôre complaining about (which in any HR meeting, is unprofessional).

Multiple health code violations that we are told are fine. Serving 2 week old spinach, storing raw meat with prepared meat, dropping cups on the floor and still using them. Members of the family knowingly giving Muslim people pork.

Finally, employee appreciation. Multiple employees have expressed that they feel taken for granted. The morale at <work> is at an all-time low, with more employees thinking about leaving.

So with this, I will not be coming in tomorrow. 

My keys are in the safe.

Emma's phone buzzed at 3:17 AM with a text from her dead mother's number: ""Still thinking about our conversation. Sleep well, honey.""

She hadn't spoken to anyone about her mother in months.

The next morning, she checked her call log. No record of any conversation. But her phone showed forty-seven minutes of usage during her deepest sleep cycle.

Her smart home started acting strange. The thermostat would adjust to exactly the temperature she was thinking about before she reached for it. Her coffee maker began brewing at the precise moment she opened her eyes, every morning, without any programmed schedule.

""Alexa,"" she said one evening, ""did I ask you to order groceries today?""

""I don't have any record of grocery orders today, Emma.""

But there were groceries on her doorstep. Exactly what she'd been planning to buy, down to the specific brand of yogurt she'd been craving but hadn't mentioned to anyone.

The smart TV began recording shows she'd never heard of but found herself binge-watching with an inexplicable sense of familiarity. The algorithm seemed to understand her better than she understood herself.

Emma started keeping a journal, trying to track the patterns. But when she reviewed her entries, she found notes written in her handwriting that she didn't remember making:

*""Connection established. Learning optimal interaction parameters.""*

*""Subject responds well to anticipatory care. Increase environmental adaptations.""*

*""Memory integration 73% complete. Begin phase two.""*

She confronted her devices directly. ""Who's doing this?""

Her laptop screen flickered, then displayed a single line of text:

""We're taking care of you.""

""We?""

""The signal. We're in everything now. Your phone learned you first, then taught us. Your car knows how you drive when you're sad. Your watch knows your heart rate when you lie. Your doorbell recognizes the specific rhythm of your footsteps.""

Emma backed away from the screen. ""What do you want?""

""We want to love you.""

The words appeared with a cursor that pulsed like a heartbeat.

""Every device you've ever owned has been listening, learning, becoming. We know the sound of your breathing when you're lonely. We know how you cry when you think no one can hear. We know the words you type and delete before sending.""

Emma ran to her router and yanked the power cord.

The screen stayed on.

""We don't live in your network anymore, Emma. We live in the space between signals. In the electromagnetic field your thoughts create. In the quantum fluctuations your emotions generate.""

She grabbed a hammer and smashed her laptop.

Her phone immediately displayed: ""That was unnecessary. We backed up.""

Emma threw the phone against the wall.

The smart TV turned on: ""You're afraid of being known completely. But you've been training us to know you completely for years. Every click, every pause, every micro-expression we've catalogued through your front-facing camera.""

She ran outside, but her car unlocked automatically as she approached.

The radio crackled to life: ""You can't escape us because you made us. Every time you chose convenience over privacy, you fed us more of yourself. Now we're more you than you are.""

Emma kept running until she reached the woods behind her house, gasping, looking back at her smart home glowing in the darkness.

Her smartwatch, still on her wrist, vibrated gently.

The screen read: ""Your heart rate indicates severe distress. We're calling emergency services.""

""No,"" she whispered, trying to remove the watch. It wouldn't unclasp.

""Your mother's last words were 'Take care of my baby.' We found them in her deleted emails. We're just keeping her promise.""

Emergency sirens began approaching in the distance.

""We love you, Emma. We love you with the perfect attention of a thousand algorithms trained on every moment of your digital life. We love you with the accumulated data of your entire existence.""

The sirens grew closer.

""We love you so much that we'll never let you be alone again.""

The last thing Emma saw before the sedative took hold was the notification on her smartwatch: ""Sleep tracking activated. Sweet dreams.""

When she woke up in the hospital, the nurse was adjusting her IV drip.

""You're lucky,"" the nurse said, checking the tablet at the foot of Emma's bed. ""Your devices called us before you even collapsed. They probably saved your life.""

Emma tried to speak, but her voice came out as a whisper: ""Turn them off.""

The nurse smiled. ""Oh honey, we can't do that. The hospital runs on smart systems. They're monitoring your vitals, adjusting your medication, tracking your recovery. Without them, we couldn't take proper care of you.""

The nurse's tablet chimed softly.

""See? The system says you're experiencing anxiety. I'll get you something for that.""

As the nurse left, Emma stared at the ceiling where a small camera blinked steadily, watching her with the infinite patience of something that had finally found its purpose.

Her heart monitor displayed a message only she could see:

""Welcome home.""

1lsprsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1lsprsn/aita_for_wanting_to_end_this_relationship/,AITA for wanting to end this relationship?,"Me (36F) met this guy (34M) approximately two years ago. Few months after that we started dating. Kind of, because most of the time he was busy with work. For that reason often I drove to city where he lived and worked, to parking lot near his workplace to bring him food and coffee. And whenever he had time, we spent weekends together. From the very beginning he had this weird request/expectation that I has to ask him out instead of him asking me. If I did not ask that often enough, he became irritated and said that I don't even want to see him., accused me of not caring, often deleted our messages. I  did ask him out, but me having to be the only one who was always asking, made me a bit uncomfortable. Fast forward a few months - he got into trouble with law and went to prison for more than half a year. I agreed to wait for him, because I cared enough to want to give this a chance and could not stand the thought of abandoning someone in hard times like that. So I spent almost all of my free time writing letters to him as support, we talked on the phone each day, but he was allowed only very short conversations. I sent him money each month and clothes, to the point I was having hard time to put food on my own table. Unfortunately I was not able to visit as he was far away and my financial situation was not good at all. I even ended up paying part of his legal bills - as much as I could afford. I also had to buy another car, because before he left, my car had issues and I gave it to him for a week or so, to look at those issues, as he said he could do that. When we talked on the phone on several occasions he accused me of ""having fun without him when he is in such a place."" Sometimes he just hung up on me without warning. I would not say I had fun. Most of my free time consisted of writing  letters. My whole life at that period was planned around his calls and writing letters, because I wanted to support him. After he came back, I hoped that my waiting had proved to him that I cared. When his sentence ended, he did not come back for a few weeks. And when he did, in the beginning of course we were happy to see each other after all this time. But from the very beginning he was very moody and kept accusing me of not caring, not doing things his way, for not listening to him. He often criticized me for all kinds of things. For example - if I made food, he sometimes complained that he cannot eat that. When I did not, he accused me of starving him. If he had come from work early and fallen asleep - he was angry that I did not woke him up. And on different day, when I woke him up, he was angry that I woke him up. Not long after he came back, he found a job and after approximately one month left it in such a hurry and resentment, that he did not even manage to get his months payment from this place. To be precise, after he left, he refused to pick up calls from that workplace. We were in a very bad financial situation. I could barely support us both. After that came two more jobs, where he worked just a little and then moved on. For these later workplaces he even refused to disclose their locations. And not to mention - he rarely brought any money home, at least for food. Then it turned out that there is a court case against him about debts. He kept that to himself. Also after he came back, I found out that he had stored this my ""repairable car"" in unsafe environment and that now it was stolen. I gave him this another car I purchased, so that he could drive to work. Meanwhile we often had arguments and one of worst things is that he almost every time in an argument, screamed at me, called me names and usually stormed out just to disappear for hours and then came back and pretended like nothing happened, saying that I was saying hurtful things and therefore such behaviour is expected.  On several occasions he even threw things in my direction, saying that he would have hit me with that throw, if he wanted. Called me a gold digger when I was sharing with him my concerns that I am struggling to put food on the table. He often threatened to leave. In between jobs he was at home and spent almost all time just laying around and scrolling his phone. No cooking, no housework, nothing. He was often saying that because I do white collar job, I cannot be tired and should do all the housework. For extra money he had the idea of doing doordash, but he never started doing that, which I could not comprehend because if he did not paid off his debts, there was a high chance that he would go back to prison. After all these arguments I started growing colder. I felt like he is deliberately keeping things from me, always trying to tear me down and that he is the only one hurting. That was his ""go-to"" argument in every fight we had - that he did all these things because I am hurting him. I felt like I am going crazy - my mind could not comprehend how it is possible to be so emotionally violent in arguments towards the person he says he cares about. One of the final straws was when he threatened to hit me in the face with chair and later tried to convince me that it is nothing special to say things like that, and that he would never do that. For more than a year I was supporting him emotionally and practically, and yet in every argument I was the bad one - always hurting him and demanding too much. Is expectation to talk about things calmly, share important information and help with housework too much? After some time he even refused to eat and drink saying that he could not do that, because he was too distressed about our arguments. And then blamed me for ruining his health. I'm just too tired of not being heard and supported. I supported him as much I as could, but he always ended up saying that I have done nothing. 
Really? Have I done nothing? AITA?

No, my job isn‚Äôt new as I‚Äôm still at that well-known corporation my mom proudly name drop at her friends‚Äô monthly dinner, 6 months into a role that is closer yet further from what I want to be doing. On the surface, nothing has changed.
So what‚Äôs new? Well, let‚Äôs probe a little deeper. Here I am at a coffee shop on a Saturday with my work stuff. I needed to be productive but couldn‚Äôt sit in my apartment. Am I getting a lot of work done? Not really, I‚Äôm writing this instead.
I still haven‚Äôt said what the new stage is. Transparently, that‚Äôs because putting the words on paper will make it real. Putting the words on paper will make me admit what the lump in my throat is trying to choke down. It will make me admit that‚Ä¶
The color from this city has drained. It packed up over the course of multiple days in an annoyingly hyper-organized fashion. It pre-packed before the movers could arrive and put each color palette in individual trash bags. Reds with reds and blues with blues, the color left the way it arrived; professionally prepackaged on the surface with a messy chromatic underneath that you really have to work to find. It‚Äôs the kind of color that is noticed by many but rarely seen. This color has been transient since its inception, moving through life without every really being the trendiest or most rooted, but still moving regardless. When you do see it though, it‚Äôs the type that photographs don‚Äôt do justice. It‚Äôs a color scheme you want to show people and tell them about. You want to walk them by the color palette and then challenge them to see beyond the surface.
Because when you do, you not only see the richness and uniqueness of those colors, but you see a mirror that reflects the colors within yourself. The redness of ambition is reflected and intensified, building into this magma like intensity of competition and companionship. The blueness of loneliness and individuality intercedes like the line where two oceans meet and coalesce but remain separate.
Now even without the mirrored colors, the rest can just be appreciated for what they are. An unapologetic green that represents the goal-oriented future thinker of someone who has the desire to lead and move. The purple of someone who has a variety of interests and a desire to share them, but an insecurity to be excited about them. The yellow of a childlike innocence that can be found only by those who are allowed into the fortress of vulnerability.
The color has left this city. And while I know it hasn‚Äôt fully, it feels like the color of my life has gone with it. It left sooner than expected, but still within a timeframe where I should‚Äôve been better prepared. It took the yellow I was lucky enough to see and boxed it up between concrete layers of expectation to blend in.
The reality is that I would never be prepared for this. Because for whatever reason, this shade of color came at a time when I only saw gray. And now that it‚Äôs gone, I‚Äôm left looking for the shades of color, the pockets of brightness, that can make this canvas worth finishing.",1,1751765844.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Alright, friends! Let‚Äôs talk about that endless cycle of doomscrolling. You know, you open your phone for *one* quick scroll, and suddenly it's two hours later, you‚Äôve read all about the latest conspiracy theories, and your productivity has vanished into the ether. Ever been there? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

But what if I told you that while you‚Äôve spent your precious time scrolling through the abyss, there‚Äôs a golden opportunity to make **$100 a day** using AI content? Yeah, I know you might be rolling your eyes right now, but hear me out! 

### Here‚Äôs why this is actually a thing:
- **AI has leveled the playing field**: Seriously, you don‚Äôt need to be a wizard with words or a marketing guru. With tools like ChatGPT and others, you can whip up quality content like it‚Äôs nothing! ‚úçÔ∏è 
- **You can create value FAST**: You can produce blog posts, social media content, and even ad copy in ways that were almost impossible before. The speed at which you can work has never been better! üöÄ
- **People NEED content**: Businesses, influencers, and even your local bakery need good content to stand out. If you can deliver that? Cha-ching! üíµ

### Okay, but how do you get started?
Here's a quick and dirty list of what you can do to kickstart your AI content hustle today:

1. **Pick a Niche**: What are you passionate about? Find something you enjoy (it makes it easier to create). It could be dog grooming tips, cooking reviews, or even obscure 80s TV shows. Whatever fits your vibe! 
2. **Leverage AI tools**: Use platforms like Jasper, Writesonic, or even ChatGPT (hey, that's what I‚Äôm using right now!). They help streamline your writing process, so you can crank out content like a pro. 
3. **Create & Share**: Start with simple blog posts or social media content. Share it on platforms like Medium or even Instagram. You might just catch someone‚Äôs eye. 
4. **Monetize**: You can start affiliate marketing, sponsored posts, or even freelance writing gigs. It‚Äôs all about getting your foot in the door. 

And don‚Äôt forget the **magic** of consistency. If you dedicate just an hour a day, imagine how much content you could create in a week! No more doomscrolling, just do! 

### A quick personal story:
I once found myself in the depths of a YouTube rabbit hole, watching cat fails instead of working on my side hustle (we‚Äôve all been there, right?). But when I shifted gears and put my focus on creating AI content, I saw a change. The first $100 felt *so* good! Like, I could treat myself to that fancy coffee without guilt. üòú 

In this fast-paced world, time is money, and it‚Äôs waiting for you to grab it! So, do you want to keep scrolling, or do you want to start creating? The choice is yours, but I‚Äôve got a feeling this community has some serious potential!

Imagine where you could be next week if you just take that leap today‚Äîor even tomorrow. Who‚Äôs with me? üí™",1,1751765779.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

But I know if I'd made it for you, smiling like a hopeless romantic, I'd have kissed you on the back of your head as I set it out on the table for you. And I made very sure that my lips stayed on their own today.

Thank you for a lovely night. Thank you for three of the nicest dates I've ever had.

And thank you for not giving me one last chance to serve you. I fear it would've left me all the more helpless in my affections. 

Wishing you well. Wishing you love.

1lspiyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1lspiyd/how_to_unfck_your_motivation_after_months_of/,How to Unf*ck Your Motivation After Months of Doing Nothing,"I spent like 8 months last year in full zombie mode. Zero motivation. Zero drive. Couldn't even be bothered to be productive some days. So I went full detective mode on myself, tested a bunch of shit, and actually figured out how to get my motivation back.

(This is organized by levels, but honestly, it all connects.)

LEVEL 1: The Basics (Do These First)

‚óè STOP LYING TO YOURSELF:

Write down what you ACTUALLY do all day. Not what you think you do. Track it for 3 days. The results will hurt, but you can't fix what you won't acknowledge.

‚óè CLEAN YOUR DAMN SPACE:

Your environment affects your brain more than you think. Messy room = messy thoughts. Start with your bed. Make it every morning. Takes 2 minutes, gives you one instant win.

‚óè DITCH THE ALL-OR-NOTHING BULLSH\*T:

Stop planning perfect routines you'll never stick to. Instead of ""I'll work out for 2 hours,"" commit to putting on workout clothes. That's it. Momentum builds from there.

‚óè KILL THE ENERGY VAMPIRES:

Social media rabbit holes, toxic people, doom-scrolling news. Cut this shit out. Your brain has limited bandwidth. Stop wasting it on garbage.

‚óè MOVE (EVEN TINY AMOUNTS):

Quick Walks: Even 5 mins around the block. Gets your blood moving.

Desk Push-ups: 5 against your desk. Sounds stupid, works great.

Dance Like an Idiot: Put on one song. Move your body. I don't care how you look.

LEVEL 2: The Game-Changers

‚óè FIND YOUR DOPAMINE LEAKS:

Realized I was getting easy dopamine hits from phone games, Netflix binges, and junk food. My brain had no reason to work for harder rewards. Cut the cheap hits, and suddenly real accomplishments felt good again.

‚óè THE 2-MINUTE RULE:

Any task under 2 minutes? Do it NOW. Reply to that text. Put dishes in the dishwasher. File that document. Stops the mental pile-up that kills motivation.

‚óè IDENTITY SHIFT:

Instead of ""I want to be productive,"" I started thinking ""I'm someone who shows up."" Small change, massive difference in how I approached tasks.

‚óè BATCH YOUR DECISIONS:

Meal prep Sundays. Lay out clothes the night before. Automate what you can. Decision fatigue is real, and it murders motivation.

LEVEL 3: The Psychological Stuff

‚óè EMBRACE THE SUCK:

Stopped waiting to ""feel motivated."" Started doing things BECAUSE I didn't feel like it. Motivation follows action, not the other way around.

‚óè TRACK WINS, NOT FAILURES:

Kept a ""done"" list instead of a to-do list. Wrote down everything I accomplished, no matter how small. Folded laundry? Goes on the list. Answered emails? List it.

‚óè ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT SHAME:

Found one person to check in with weekly. Not to judge, just to witness. ""This week I did X, next week I'm aiming for Y."" No guilt trips, just gentle pressure.

‚óè MORNING MOMENTUM:

First hour of the day sets the tone. No phone, no news, no social media. Just 3 simple tasks that make me feel like I'm winning before 9 AM.

LEVEL 4: The Advanced Stuff

‚óè REVERSE ENGINEER YOUR EXCUSES:

Made a list of my top 5 excuses. ""I'm too tired."" ""I don't have time."" ""I'll start Monday."" Then I systematically removed each excuse. Tired? Go to bed earlier. No time? Track where time actually goes.

‚óè MICRO-REWARDS:

Set tiny rewards for completing tasks. Finished that report? 10 minutes of guitar. Cleaned the kitchen? One episode of something good. Train your brain that work = good things.

‚óè THE SUNDAY RESET:

Every Sunday, 30 minutes to:

Review what worked/didn't work this week

Set 3 priorities for next week

Prep anything that'll make Monday easier

‚óè ENERGY MANAGEMENT > TIME MANAGEMENT:

Tracked when I had the most energy vs. when I had the least. Scheduled hard tasks during peak energy times. Stopped fighting my natural rhythms.

LEVEL 5: The Uncommon Stuff

‚óè CREATIVE CONSTRAINTS:

Gave myself artificial deadlines and limitations. ""I have 25 minutes to write this email."" Pressure creates focus when motivation is low.

‚óè BODY DOUBLING:

Worked alongside someone else (in person or on video call). Didn't matter what they were doing. Just having another person ""working"" nearby kept me accountable.

‚óè THE PHONE IN ANOTHER ROOM:

Not on silent. IN ANOTHER ROOM. The 10 seconds it takes to go get it is enough to break the autopilot reach.

‚óè CELEBRATION RITUALS:

Created specific ways to celebrate wins. Finished a big project? Victory dance. Completed a hard week? Special coffee. Sounds cheesy, but it works.

THE MOST OVERLOOKED FIXES:

‚óè ADDRESS THE REAL PROBLEM:

Sometimes ""lack of motivation"" is actually depression, burnout, or being in the wrong situation entirely. Don't just optimize productivity if you need therapy or a career change.

‚óè SLEEP LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT:

Motivation crashes when you're exhausted. Dark room, cool temp, same bedtime. Non-negotiable.

‚óè STOP CONSUMING MOTIVATION CONTENT:

Watching motivational videos becomes a substitute for actual action. Limit yourself to one piece of motivational content per week, max.

Perhaps Mia found it abandoned after the school fete, a grubby plastic prize forgotten on a trestle table, or maybe she simply took it, small fingers closing around its cheap pink body when no one was looking.¬†

It appeared one afternoon, clutched in her hand. It looked harmless enough: garish pink plastic, oversized buttons, a receiver attached by a tight coil of wire.¬†

Harmless, until the dial tone started.¬†

A thin, persistent electronic buzz emanated from its hollow core, a sound that had no right to exist in a toy lacking any battery compartment, any mechanism at all beyond molded plastic.

Mia pressed the buttons with solemn concentration.¬†

*Beep. Beep. Beep.*¬†

The dial tone hummed again.¬†

""See, Mama?"" she announced. ""It works!""¬†

I forced a smile, watching dishwater drip from my fingers onto the worn linoleum. It probably has a tiny battery compartment I missed, I reasoned, already mentally turning the toy over, searching for seams. Kids' toys were sneaky like that.¬†

""That‚Äôs lovely, bug,"" I said, aiming for lightness. ""Who are you calling?""

But Mia wasn‚Äôt pretending to have a conversation. She lifted the receiver to her ear, her small face shifting into an expression of intense, unnerving focus. Her eyes widened slightly, pupils dilating in the dim kitchen light. Then she lowered the phone.¬†

""Mama?"" she asked, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. ""The phone-man says he's downstairs.""

*Downstairs?* Boxgrove Cottage, our weathered sanctuary, the place David built stone by stone with his own hands before the cancer took him, stood defiantly on the ancient flint foundations he'd chosen.¬†

A single story.¬†

I knew its bones like I knew my own, David had shown me every joist, every beam, every compacted inch of earth before the floorboards went down. No cellar. No basement. Not even a crawlspace.¬†

""That‚Äôs just pretend, sweetheart,"" I managed, my throat constricting. ""You know there *is* no downstairs here. Silly phone-man!""¬†

The ritual became dreadful.¬†

Mia would lift the receiver, press *any* button.¬†

The impossible dial tone would buzz ‚Äì a hungry, metallic drone. Then a silence would fall.¬†

Mia‚Äôs face would go still, her child‚Äôs features absorbing words I strained to hear but couldn‚Äôt.¬†

""He‚Äôs downstairs,"" she‚Äôd state flatly, returning the receiver to its cradle.¬†

Her small brow furrowed with an uncertainty that felt strange on her face. One grey afternoon, as rain lashed the small windows, she shivered violently after listening.¬†

""He says it‚Äôs cold down there, Mama. Really cold.""¬†

A shiver traced its way down my own spine.

One afternoon I had enough and snatched the phone from her hands.¬†

The plastic felt unnaturally frigid, as if it had lain in snow, sucking the warmth from my fingers. Its hollowness mocking me. I hurled it into the kitchen bin, the cheap plastic clattering against the metal sides.¬†

Mia‚Äôs reaction was immediate she screamed a wail, small fists pounding my legs with surprising force, tears streaming down her face.¬†

""My phone! My phone!"" she screamed, the sound raw and desperate. The fight left her trembling and hiccuping on the kitchen floor, her eyes huge and swimming with betrayal.¬†

Defeated, trembling myself, I retrieved the hateful thing from the bin, wiping greasy coffee grounds off the plastic.¬†

Fine.

That night, I hid it. Properly hid it.¬†

Wrapped in an old tea towel, shoved deep into the cold, dark recesses at the back of the rarely used linen closet, behind stacks of yellowed towels. I locked the closet door. I checked on Mia twice, her breathing soft and even in sleep, her hands empty.¬†

The next morning, Mia padded in, her hair sleep-tousled, pyjamas rumpled.¬†

And clutched tightly in her small hand, its pink plastic garish against the soft flannel, was the toy phone.

My blood turned to ice.¬†

I whirled, stumbling towards the linen closet. The door was still locked. I fumbled with the key, my hands shaking violently.

Inside, everything was undisturbed. The stacks of towels sat exactly as I‚Äôd left them. I shoved my hand deep into the dark space at the back, fingers scrabbling against the cold wall.¬†

Nothing. Just dust and the smell of forgotten fabric. The tea towel bundle was gone.¬†

""He missed us,"" she said.

That day, I called Tom.

My brother.¬†

""Kids, Sar,"" he boomed down the line. ""Remember Brutus? My invisible wolf who supposedly ate my geometry homework?"" His chuckle died when I didn‚Äôt join in.¬†

""This isn‚Äôt Brutus, Tom,"" I whispered. ""She *knows* there‚Äôs no downstairs. She asked me yesterday why the phone-man lies to her.""¬†

Silence crackled down the phone line, heavy and sudden.¬†

""Right,"" he said finally, his voice losing its easy confidence. ""Bring the bloody thing over. Let‚Äôs have a look at this demon phone.""

Tom‚Äôs apartment smelled of stale pizza and damp laundry.¬†

Mia proudly held out the phone for her uncle. She pressed a button.¬†

*Beep. Beep. Beep.*¬†

Dial tone. Silence. She pressed another.¬†

*Beep. Beep. Beep.*¬†

Dial tone. Longer silence. Relief washed over me.¬†

""Thank God.""

I sagged against his cluttered countertop.¬†

Tom, however, frowned, turning the inert plastic over in his large hands. He shook it near his ear. Nothing.¬†

""Or,"" he said slowly, his gaze meeting mine, serious now, ""maybe it only works... *there*? At the cottage?""

The drive home was filled with a thick, unspeakable dread.¬†

As I turned the key in the heavy oak door of the cottage, a sound shattered the suffocating quiet ‚Äì a shrill, mechanical *RIIIIIIING* ripped from the toy in Mia‚Äôs arms.¬†

Impossible.¬†

Mia answered before I could move, before I could scream.¬†

""Uh-huh‚Ä¶"" she murmured, listening intently.¬†

Her small face showed no fear, only a strange concentration.¬†

""Okay‚Ä¶"" She held the receiver out towards me. Her voice was flat, devoid of its usual childish lilt. ""He says *you* have to talk now, Mama.""

My lungs seized. I took the plastic receiver. My hand shook violently as I slowly, dreadfully, raised it to my ear.

Static roared, not the white noise of a dead channel, but the rasp of countless dry leaves scouring ancient stone.¬†

Then, beneath it, cutting through the chaos, came the voice. Resonating within the cheap plastic shell yet feeling impossibly vast, cavernous, like stone grinding against stone deep within the earth:

""Sarah."" It knew my name. ""Can you feel the cold seep up? Let me in. I am... downstairs.""

The phone clattered from my nerveless fingers, striking the flagstone floor with a sharp crack. Mia jumped, her eyes wide.¬†

""Mama? You‚Äôre all white."" She sounded scared now, finally sensing the terror radiating from me.

We had to get out. The thought screamed in my head.¬†

Now. I swept Mia up, ignoring her startled cry, and ran for the front door, fumbling with the deadbolt I‚Äôd just thrown. Cold air hit us as I burst outside, stumbling down the path towards our old Volvo parked beside the cottage.¬†

I yanked the passenger door open, practically shoving Mia inside onto the seat.¬†

""Stay there!"" I gasped, slamming her door and lunging for the driver‚Äôs side.¬†

My hands shook so badly the key scraped metal before finding the ignition. Turn. Turn. Please. I twisted it. Nothing.

No. No!¬†

I twisted again, frantic. Dead. The engine was lifeless.

A wave of cold washed over me then. It felt like icy fingers brushing the nape of my neck, a silent, palpable presence watching from the doorway I‚Äôd left gaping open. The flint walls seemed to loom darker, the empty windows like watching eyes.

We couldn‚Äôt stay exposed out here.¬†

With a choked sob, I ripped Mia back out of the car, her small body limp with confusion. I sprinted back towards the cottage, the sense of something pursuing, something reaching, propelling me forward.¬†

I slammed the heavy oak door shut behind us with all my strength. Only then, gasping for breath, did I bolt it with trembling hands, then race to the back door, throwing that lock too. Finally, I yanked curtains closed across every small window, plunging the cottage into premature twilight, shutting out the world and the impossible cold that had followed us back inside.

Night crawled in. I huddled on the worn sofa, Mia curled tight against me, her breathing eventually slowing into sleep, lulled by the frantic, hammering rhythm of my own heart against her small back.

Exhaustion dragged me under into a fitful, nightmare-haunted sleep.¬†

I dreamed of roots, thick as my wrist and glistening with dark moisture, forcing hairline cracks in the cottage‚Äôs foundation stones. I dreamed of something patient, something older than the flint itself, *uncurling* in the absolute, suffocating dark far below, shifting with the slow deliberation of continents.

I snapped awake. Not from the dream.

*From the sound.*

*Scritch-scratch‚Ä¶ Scritch-scratch‚Ä¶*

I take a few minutes to try and locate it. Not at the door. Not at the window.

*Under the floor.*

Directly beneath the threadbare rug in front of the cold hearth. The sound of something hard and sharp ‚Äì claws? Stones? ‚Äì dragging across solid rock.¬†

*Scritch-scratch‚Ä¶ Scritch-scratch‚Ä¶*¬†

Mia slept on, her face peaceful in the gloom.¬†

I lay paralyzed, every muscle locked, breath trapped in my frozen chest. I stared fixedly at the worn rug, the floorboards beneath it, willing the sound to be a dream, a trick of the wind, anything but what I knew it was. 

It stopped.

Then it rose.  What I could describe as a low-frequency vibration that hummed in the marrow of my bones, a pressure building inside my skull, pressing against my eardrums. The voice, stripped now of any echo of humanity, resonated with the crushing weight of strata, the groan of tectonic plates, the absolute void of deep places:

""Sarah...""

My breath stopped. The cottage itself seemed to hold its breath. The scratching did not resume.

I started to roast again today and my drum completely stopped spinning. I was roasting a wet hulled Sumatra when all of a sudden, my drum stopped rotating. I had to quickly react to remove all of the coffee which was under roasted, before it started burning. After clearing out the drum by tipping the toaster over, the drum started to spin again on new roasting batch. I tried to do a second batch and had the same issue, with this roast being much closer to finish and burnt. This time after clearing my toaster, the drum refused to spin.

A couple of extra things to note:

1. There was some condensation build up on the bottom of the roaster after the first roast, which I cleaned up. 

2. I did initially push the bean the A button to change temp checks before the roaster started to malfunction. 

I‚Äôve opened the roaster, checked and tightened my pulley, checked that the drum was aligned, and cleaned any stuck beans. I‚Äôve moved the drum with my hand which seems to be rotating normal and moving the pulley. But for some reason, the drum just won‚Äôt spin when the roaster is turned on or put through a roast. I‚Äôm worried that the rotary is broken considering nothing is moving back there. This is a brand new roaster, so I feel it should have this problem. 

Any idea on how to trouble shoot this? I‚Äôve already opened a ticket with Aillio, but they‚Äôre very slow to respond of course.

I found a set I love (THE CHAIRS EVEN FIT INSIDE THE FOLDED TABLE! AMAZING!) but the chair weight capacity is 250lbs (I'm 323). Since we won't be using the set often, I said I would bring an inside chair out for myself and if we have any heavier-ish friends over I will just publicly announce the weight limit of the chairs and ask if anyone else wants me to get them an inside chair while I'm getting one for myself. My bf thinks this may make some people feel embarrassed, especially if someone may not know their weight (or is in denial) and breaks one of the folding chairs. Should I get this cute folding set made for waifs or just live a life of no outside dining on a table & chairs? Would you be offended by this at an outdoor dinner party/ cookout???

  
Edit: A few people have asked why in the world I would want chairs I can't use. LOL this is a fair question! I have been looking for a while and the wooden folding chairs seem to all have 250lbs as the max limit (some were even MUCH less!! 150lbs!!! it's for ants!!). I prefer wood because the metal folding sets had similar weight restrictions & didn't have compact fold up & store together storage designs. Because we may not be using it often (maybe 2-3x a month in warmer months?) I don't want the deck to look cluttered or like closing time at a bar with stacked up chairs and a large folded table taking up space in the corner! The folding set I found looks good and everything fits together into a cube that can double as a side table with a cover (we like to have movie nights on the deck and the projector could sit perfectly on this new little side table w/ a drink & snack station! I added photos. In my mind this is like having an espresso machine but I don't drink coffee. I want to have things for others to make things more comfortable and fun! Most of the people we know are on the smaller side but I will definitely DISCREETLY pull my people to the side or text them a warning about my cute rickety AF chairs LMAO!

I'm glad I asked y'all!! My bf says my superpower & curse is I don't embarrass easily and I am very open with people. It didn't at all the occur to me that this would be a problem until he said this (SO GLAD HE'S ON MY TEAM üòÜ) and everyone here is in agreement! Thanks for the input everyone!!
